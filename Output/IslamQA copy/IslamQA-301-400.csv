306,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/306,Can You Pray Tahiyyatul Masjid after ‘Asr?,"If a person enters the Masjid during one of the times when making prayer is makruh (e.g. sunrise, sunset, zawal,...), does he still have to pray two rak`ahs of Tahiyyat Al-masjid?","The correct opinion is that you can pray Tahiyyat al-Masjid at all times, even after Fajr and after ‘Asr because of the general applicability of the hadith “When any one of you enters the Mosque, he should not sit down until he has prayed two rak`ahs.”",,"Praise be to Allah.There are differences among the scholars concerning this matter. The correct opinion is that Tahiyyat al-masjid is permitted at all times, even after Fajr and after ‘Asr, because of the general applicability of the hadith “When any one of you enters the Mosque, he should not sit down until he has prayed two rak`ahs.” (Sahih – agreed upon)  
Tahiyyat al-masjid is one of the prayers that is done for a specific reason, like Salat al-Tawaf (prayer done after circumambulating the Ka`bah) and Salat al-Kusuf (prayer at the time of an eclipse). The correct view concerning all of these is that it is permissible to do these at times when prayer is generally disallowed, like making up missed prayers. 
Concerning Salat al-Tawaf, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “O Banu ‘Abd Manaf, do not prevent anyone from circumambulating this House and praying at any time of night or day.” (Reported by Imam Ahmad and the authors of Sunan with a sahih isnad) 
Concerning Salat al-Kusuf , he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The sun and moon are two of the Signs of Allah; they are not eclipsed because of the death or life of anyone.” (1/332)

307,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/307,Rules of Erth (Inheritance),"Can somebody please let me know the Rules in Islam about the State and Inheritance. My 
father is died and he left four sons, three daughters and my mother is alive.
Jazakallahulkhairun.",,,"Praise be to Allah.al-hamdu lillaah.
The division of the inheritance in the case you mention is as follows: 
An eighth of it is due to the wife, since the father had children, as indicated in the verse (intrepretation of 
the meaning):
""And if you have children, then to them (the wives) is due an eighth of what you have left behind, 
after [paying] any amount specified in the will or any loans due."" (surat al-Nisaa':12).
The remaining seven-eighths (7/8) is divided into 11 equal portions. Each male among his children is 
entitled to two portions and each female one portion, as per Allaah's specification (interpretation of the 
meaning):
""Allaah has enjoined upon you with regards to your children that the [entitlement of] the male is 
twice that of the female."" (al-Nisaa':11). 
For example, let's suppose the man in question left property and wealth with a total worth of $88,000, 
and he does not owe payment on any loans and did not specify any special requests or instructions to 
make particular donations in his will. Thus, the division would be as follows: 
For the wife, an eighth, 1/8 of 88,000 which is $11,000. 
The remaining 77,000 is divided into 11 equal portions, 1/11 * 77,000 = $7,000
So each son is entitled to two portions, or 2 * 7,000 = $14,000 
And each daughter is entitled to $7,000.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

The people said: ""O Messenger of Allah, we should learn these words."" He said: ""The one hears them should learn them.""
 
Ibn ‘Abbas reported that at times of distress, the Messenger of Allah (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) used to say: ""There is no god but Allah, the All-Great, the Patient; there is no god but Allah, Lord of the Mighty Throne; there is no god but Allah, the Lord of heaven, the Lord of earth, and the Lord of the Noble Throne.""

The second opinion is the soundest course to take.",,"Praise be to Allah.If a man has divorced his wife for the first or second time, she spends her ‘iddah (waiting period) in his house and stays with him because she is still his wife and under his guardianship.
If he wants to have intercourse with her, then according to some scholars if he does so at that time (i.e. the time of iddah), this means that he has taken her back and her ‘iddah is over. 
Other scholars say that he should say words that indicate that he has taken her back (e.g., ""I take you back"" or ""I take so-and-so back"") before he has intercourse with her, and that there should be two Muslim witnesses to these words. This puts an end to the ‘iddah , and he may then have intercourse with her whenever he wishes.

But she needs a mairram and her husband nor her brothers are able to go. We have asked an alm he said she can go with her brother in-law which is also her first cousin. As long as his wife is there which she will be cause she's going too. Is this permissable in Islam because I still have my doubts.,,,"Praise be to Allah.One of the ways in which Islam protects women is that it requires a woman to travel with a mahram, to protect her from those who have bad intentions and to help her, because of her weakness, in facing the arduous trials of travelling. A woman is not permitted to travel without a mahram because of the hadith narrated by Ibn Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him), who reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: A woman should absolutely not travel unless she has a mahram with her. A man stood up and said, O Messenger of Allah, I have enlisted in such-and-such a military campaign, and my wife has set out for Hajj. He said, Go and do Hajj with your wife.(al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, 3006).
What indicates that a mahram is obligatory is the fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded this man to give up the idea of jihaad (on this occasion), even though he had enlisted for a campaign and his wife was travelling for the purpose of worship, not for some frivolous or suspicious reason. In spite of all this, he told him to go and do Hajj with his wife.
The ulamaa have listed five conditions for a person to be considered a mahram. He should be male, Muslim, adult, and of sound mind, and he should be a relative to whom marriage is permanently forbidden, such as a father, brother, paternal uncle, maternal uncle, father in law, mothers husband or brother through radaaah (breastfeeding), etc. (as opposed to relatives to whom marriage is temporarily forbidden, such as a sisters husband, paternal aunts husband, maternal aunts husband).
On this basis, the husbands brother and the son of a paternal or maternal uncle are not mahrams, so it is not permitted for her to travel with them.

The most predominant opinion is that the maximum period is 40 days.",,"Praise be to Allah.There is a dispute amongst the religious scholars regarding the longest period of Nifas (the post-natal bleeding period). Some scholars say it is forty (40) days , others say it is sixty (60) days and some say there is no limit to the maximum number of days a woman can be in a state of Nifas. The most predominant opinion is that the maximum period is forty (40) days according to what is narrated by Umm Salamah. Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) said ""The Nufasa' (a woman in Nifas) used to continue to be in childbed for forty days at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him).""
At-Tirmidhi (may Allah have mercy on him) reported: ""It is unanimously agreed upon among religious scholars from the Companions and the Successors that the Nufasa' does not pray for forty days unless she sees blood stoppage before the end of the forty days period . She should then perform Ghusl and she resumes praying. 
The majority of the religious scholars say that a woman does pray even if she continues to notice blood after the forty days period expires and this is the opinion of the majority of jurists among whom Sufyan Ath-Thawri, Ibn Al-Mubarak, Ash-Shafi`i, Ahmad and Is-haq."" (Sunan At-Tirmidhi Hadith # 139)
The same Hadith is also reported by Imam Ahmad, Abu Dawud, Ibn Majah and Ad-Darami and is classified as good by Al-Albani in Irwa' Al-Ghalil (201). Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) has supported this narration by another Hadith reported by Abu Dawud narrated by Umm Salama (may Allah be pleased with her) who said, ""A Prophet's (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wife used to remain in (a state of) Nifas for forty nights and the Prophet would not ask her to make up the prayers she missed during the period of Nifas"".
Ibn Majah also reported that Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that ""The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had specified a period of forty days for the Nufasa' unless she achieves purity before that."" (Irwa' Al Ghalil, 223-222/1)
Therefore, if a woman experiencing post-childbirth bleeding spent forty days and she still sees blood, then we consider this blood as Istihadah (irregular bleeding outside menses) which does not stop a woman from performing prayer nor fasting, unless the end of the forty days coincides with the regular menstrual period; in this case she would consider this blood as menstrual blood.

Wasting of time in something which has no benefit in this life nor in the hereafter.

The reactions of non-muslim mothers towards their children's embracement of Islam varies. Some mothers 
are peaceful and passive considering this as a personal matter which does not affect the relationship 
between the mother and her son or daughter. In such cases more piety by the child towards his or her 
mother will make the mother admire and respect Islam.
Other mothers adopts a more stubborn approach at the beginning but the mother finally gives in and 
accepts the new religion as a fact of life after she sees the child's determination and persistence which could 
lead the mother herself to embrace Islam.
In the third case we find that some mothers are constantly stubborn to the extent that she might hurt and 
oppress her son or daughter. Usually such mothers are blindly prejudice because they consider that her son 
or daughter had gone astray by leaving the faith of his fathers and ancestors and she must do something to 
help go back to the right path (according to the mother).
The following are three stories that took place at the time of the Prophet, Peace and Blessings be Upon 
Him, that involved three of the Sahaba (Companions of the Prophet, Peace and Blessings be Upon Him) 
which illustrates the reactions of their mothers after they embraced Islam:
Story #1
On the authority of Asmaa' Bint Abi Bakr she said ""My mother came to visit me one day. At 
that time she was still a polytheist and there was a pledge between the Prophet, Peace and 
Blessings be Upon Him, and Quraish (one of the great tribes in Arabia that lived in Mecca in 
the pre Islamic Period of Ignorance who used to enjoy great spiritual and financial powers). I 
requested the Prophet's, Peace and Blessings be Upon Him, religious verdict and said: Oh 
Prophet of Allah, my mother came to visit me, seeking my help; should I keep a good 
relationship with her? Yes, keep a good relation with her said the Prophet, Peace and 
Blessings be Upon Him:. Reported by Bukhari and Muslim, and this narration is listed in Sahih 
Muslim under # 1003.
In another version narrated by Ahmad, on the authority of Asmaa' Bint Abi Bakr she said "" My 
mother came to visit me when she was still a polytheist and she was living amongst Quraish. 
She was desirous, meaning in need, so I asked the Prophet, Peace and Blessings be Upon 
Him, and said: Oh Prophet of Allah my mother came to me and she is a polytheist and she 
needs help. Should I keep a good relationship with her? He said yes maintain a good 
relationship with her.
Story #2
On the authority of Abu-Huraira, who said: I used to call my mother to Islam when she was 
still a polytheist. One day, while I was calling her she mentioned something about the Prophet
, Peace and Blessings be Upon Him, that I detested. So I went to see the Prophet, Peace 
and Blessings be Upon Him, while crying and told him: I used to call my mother to Islam and 
she would refuse. I called her today and she mentioned something about you that I detested. 
Please invoke the blessings and guidance of Allah on her. Then the Prophet, Peace and 
Blessings be Upon Him, said: O Great Allah guide the mother of Abu-Huraira. So I left full of 
hope because of the Prophet's supplication for my mother. When I reached home I found that 
the door was partially closed. My mother heard my footsteps and said: Stay still Abu-Huraira, 
then I heard the water running; he added my mother performed body ablution, put on her 
cloths and hurriedly opened the door without her head-cover and said: ""None has the right to 
be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad, Peace and Blessings be Upon Him, is the 
Messenger of Allah"". I went back to the Prophet, Peace and Blessings be Upon Him, crying 
of joy and told him: I am bringing you good news; Allah answered your prayers and guided the 
mother of Abu-Huraira. The Prophet, Peace and Blessings be Upon Him, praised and 
glorified Allah and said: this is good. I said: Oh Messenger of Allah, pray to Allah to make me 
and my mother beloved by Allah's believing slaves and make us love them. The Prophet, 
Peace and Blessings be Upon Him, said: Oh Allah, make this little slave of Yours and his 
mother (meaning Abu-Huraira and his mother) become beloved by your believing slaves and 
make the believers love them. Ever since, there was not a believer who heard of me, even 
without seeing me, that did not love me. Reported by Muslim in Sahih Muslim (Muslim 
Authentic volumes) under # 2491.
Story # 3
On the authority of Saa'd (Ibn Abi Waqas May Allah be pleased with him) who said that 
verses of the Qur'an revealed his story. He said Um Saa'd (his mother) swore not to talk to 
him ever nor eat or drink until he renounces Islam. She said: You claim that Allah commanded 
you to obey your parents. I am your mother and I order you to do this ( to renounce Islam). 
He said: She stayed with nothing to eat or drink for three days until she fainted because of 
strain. Then one of her other sons named Umarah gave her water to drink. And she started to 
imprecate against Saa'd, then Allah revealed this verse in the Qur'an, which translates to the 
meaning of And We have enjoined on man to be good and dutiful to his parents; but if they 
strive to make you join with Me (in worship) anything (as a partner) of which you have no 
knowledge, then obey them not. Unto Me is your return and I shall tell you what you used to 
do Verse 29:8 - Surah 29, Al Ankabut. This Hadith is narrated by Imam Ahmad in his 
Musnad and in Sahih Muslim in his Sahih under # 1748.
Also, Allah revealed another verse in the Qur'an, which translates to:
""But if they (both) strive with you to make you join in worship with Me others that if which you have no 
knowledge, then obey them not; but behave with them in the world kindly, and follow the path of him 
who turns to me in repentance and in obedience. Then to Me will be your return, and I shall tell you 
what you used to do""( 31:15 - Surah Luqman).
Based on the above stories one can determine how to deal with a non believing mother and can draw the 
following significant conclusions:
The importance of good presentation of Islam to the non believing mother and to try to kindly 
persuade her and to strive to convince her as Abu Huraira did (story # 1)

Continue to do good to the non believing mother and to remember that her disbelief does not justify 
disobedience by the son or daughter and that doing her good does not contradict with your innocence 
of her as a non believer, on the contrary as it is stated in Verse 31:15 above, Allah has commanded us 
to treat the non believing parents kindly even if they strive to make their child a polytheist because of 
their rights as parents hoping that they will embrace Islam.

Continue to sincerely pray and supplicate for the non believing mother hoping that Allah may guide 
her, as evident in Abu Huraira's story (story #2).

The divine guidance of Allah may come after continuous strive by the child and strong objection of 
the mother as in Abu Huraira's story, therefore the son should never surrender or give up but should 
continue to pray and supplicate for the non believing mother.

Regardless of how hard does the non believing mother strive to make the son renounces Islam, and 
the pressure she will exercise against her son such as refusing to eat or invoking upon him , the son 
should never surrender or give in nor should he retrocede away from the righteous path as one of the 
Sahaba said to his non believing mother in a similar situation: :If you had one hundred (100) souls and 
it all left your body one after the other I will never give up my religion (Islam)"".

It seems that the mother in question deliberately oppresses her daughter through estrangement which makes 
her emotional torn but that should never weaken the muslim or shake his faith and belief in his religion. 
There is no objection to make the non believing mother understand that you are not going to retrocede , 
however she (the mother) can kindly ask for anything and she will be immediately answered to it except for 
giving up this religion.
We ask Allah to quickly guide her to the righteous path and give you patience to call her to Islam and lead 
you to the righteous and correct way.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
324,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/324,Difference Between Punishments and Trials,"Allah mentions in the Quran that when an evil befalls us it is due to what our own hands have earned. Also our beloved Messenger, Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said in a hadeeth (report) that the most tried are the Prophets, then those in piety after those. So therefore in our day to day life when things go wrong in our lives, how do we decide whether it is due to our sinfulness or that Allah loves us  and therefore sends a trial upon us?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Punishments are what happen to people in 
    return for their evil deeds. Trials are tests which are sent to try people, 
    and people may be tested by good things or by bad.

    Concerning punishments, Allah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Whatever of good reaches you, is from 
    Allah, but whatever of evil befalls you, is from yourself…” 

    [al-Nisa 4:79]

    Concerning the phrase “is from yourself”, 
    Qatadah said: “[It means] the punishment is for you, O son of Adam, because 
    of your sin.” Abu Salih said that “whatever of evil befalls you, is 
    from yourself” means “because of your sin, and I [Allah] am the One 
    Who decreed it for you.” (Tafseer Ibn 
    Katheer).

    Allah also says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): “And whatever of misfortune befalls you, it is because of what 
    your hands have earned. And He pardons much.” 

    [al-Shoora 42:30]

    Ibn Katheer, may Allah have mercy on him, 
    said: “[It means] whatever misfortune happens to you, O people, is because 
    of evil deeds that you have already done, and ‘He pardons much’ refers to 
    evil deeds – He does not punish you for them but He pardons them. ‘And if 
    Allah were to punish men for that which they earned, he would not leave a 
    moving (living) creature on the surface of the earth…’ [Fatir 35:45 – 
    interpretation of the meaning].” 

    Concerning trials, the Prophet (peace and 
    blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If Allah loves a people, He tries 
    them, and whoever has patience will have patience, and whoever is anxious 
    will be anxious.” (Reported by al-Imam Ahmad; Saheeh 
    al-Jami’, 1706).

    The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be 
    upon him) also said: “The extent of the reward will be in accordance with 
    the extent of the trial. If Allah loves a people, He tries them, and whoever 
    is content will have contentment, and whoever is angry will have anger.” 
    (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 2320; Saheeh al-Jami’, 2210).

    The following outlines how one may tell 
    whether a given event is a punishment or a trial:

    If the misfortune results from doing an act 
    of obedience to Allah, such as being wounded in jihad, or losing money when 
    migrating for the sake of Allah, or losing a job because of becoming a 
    Muslim or increasing one’s commitment to Islam, then this is a trial. 
    Whoever bears it with patience will be rewarded, but if one reacts angrily 
    then one will earn the wrath of Allah. If the misfortune results from sin, 
    such as sexually-transmitted diseases or illnesses caused by drinking 
    alcohol and taking drugs, and so on, then this is the kind of punishment 
    that comes in this world (as opposed to being deferred until the Hereafter). 
    If the misfortune is connected neither to a good deed nor a sin – such as 
    other kinds of diseases and sicknesses, losing a child, or failing in 
    business – then it depends on the person’s situation. If he is good and 
    devout, it is a trial, and if he is sinful, it is a punishment.

    The misfortune may be a punishment to atone 
    for sins, or it may be a trial aimed at raising a person’s status and 
    increasing his hasanat (good deeds/rewards) – this may be determined 
    by whether a person is obedient or disobedient. A person should not praise 
    himself, rather he should criticize himself for his shortcomings and strive 
    to attain perfection. He will benefit from misfortunes in any case, if he 
    has patience and hopes for reward.

What can we DO!!!I dont want to lose her I love her soooo much.Is there anything we can do?",,,"Praise be to Allah.besides Whom there is nobody to praise when calamity strikes.
My dear brother, you should realize that no calamity befalls a person except because of sin, and it cannot be lifted except by repentance.
Despite all the hardship you are facing and the intense pain you are feeling, you still have to think about the root of the problem and understand the shar’i ruling on it and learn a lesson from what has happened. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“… whatever of evil befalls you, is from yourself…”
[al-Nisa’ 4:79]
it comes from yourself because you gave yourself free rein in starting this forbidden relationship and getting to know this girl in a manner that is not approved of in sharee’ah, and because you indulged in absolute freedom in an environment that is far removed from the laws of Allaah.
Don’t you see that our Lord is truly Wise and All-Knowing when He forbids men to deliberately look at non-mahram women or to touch them or be alone with them or take them as friends? Allaah knows that this leads to haraam things whether it is immoral actions of varying decrees or falling in love – which is the serious and fatal disease from which you are suffering because of your sin. You have become one of its victims, suffering its pain and choking on it.
You have been very frank in describing this disease from its onset, and how you fell into this devilish trap, when you said in your question: “I have met a wonderful Muslim girl six months ago... We talked for many months and have become very close. Actually we are in love with each other.”
But you mention that you feel that Allaah has led you to one another. If you mean that this has happened by the will and decree of Allaah, then this is correct. Even Iblees exists by the will and decree of Allaah. But if you meant that Allaah decreed this because He likes it and approves of it, (this is wrong, because) Allaah does not approve of anything that is haraam. Just because something happens does not mean that Allaah likes it or approves of it. Allaah decrees good and evil for reasons which only He knows.
If you say now that what has happened has happened, and cannot be changed, so what can we do about this father who is standing in the way of these two lovers who want to get married?
I would say that there is nothing wrong with making efforts – in halaal ways, of course – to persuade this father, such as bringing mediators from within the family, or the imaam of the Islamic Centre where the father goes, and so on, and praying earnestly to Allaah to make this girl part of your lot in life if this is good for you and for her. If what you want happens, then praise be to Allaah, Who is the Giver of bounty and blessings.
But if all attempts fail, mediation does not work and the wind blows in the way that the sailor does not like (i.e., things do not go the way you hoped), then you should know that from the point of view of sharee’ah you can never marry this girl without the consent of her guardian – which is her father in the case – because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Any woman who gets married without the consent of her guardian, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid.”
(Reported by al-Tirmidhi, no. 1102, and by Abu Dawood, Ahmad and Ibn Maajah. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 2709). The marriage contract will not be valid even if it was approved by jaahili courts and kaafir judges.
It is impossible for running away with this girl to be a valid solution, either in this world or in the next.
We must also ask some other questions raised by your situation, such as: what is your commitment to Islam – do you pray regularly, for example? Does she adhere to the hijaab prescribed by sharee’ah? What is the attitude of your own family to the idea of your marrying this girl?
Finally, you must realize that you will have to forget about her if she marries someone else. In that case, you should not waste your life regretting losing her. You never know where good may come from. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“… it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you, and that you like a thing which is bad for you. Allaah knows but you do not know.”
[al-Baqarah 2:216]
What has happened is a mistake of which you are going to bear the bitter consequences, but you have to be sincere towards Allaah and strive to repent and turn back to Him. If this girl is not destined to be your lot in life, then we ask Allaah to compensate you with someone better than her. “Verily, he who fears Allaah with obedience to Him, and is patient, then surely, Allaah makes not the reward of the muhsinoon (good-doers) to be lost.” [Yoosuf 12:90 – interpretation of the meaning].",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

Tips on how to give up masturbation","Praise be to Allah.
Is masturbation haram in Islam?
Masturbation (for both men and women) is haraam (forbidden) in Islam based on the following evidence:
Prohibition of masturbation in the Quran
Al-Imam Shafi'i stated that masturbation is forbidden based on the following verses from the Quran (interpretation of the meaning):
{And those who guard their chastity (i.e. private parts, from illegal sexual acts). Except from their wives or (the captives and slaves) that their right hands possess, - for them, they are free from blame. But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors.} (Al-Muminun 23:5-7)
Here the verses are clear in forbidding all illegal sexual acts (including masturbation) except for the wives or what their right hand possesses. {And whoever seeks beyond that is the transgressor.} 
Some scholars used as evidence the ayah (in meaning),
{And let those who find not the financial means for marriage keep themselves chaste, until Allah enriches them of His bounty.} (Al-Nur 24:33)
This verse also clearly orders whoever does not have the financial means to marry to keep himself chaste and be patient in facing temptations (including masturbation) until Allah enriches them of His bounty.
Prohibition of masturbation in the Sunnah
'Abdullaah ibn Mas’ud said, ""We were with the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) while we were young and had no wealth whatsoever. Allah's Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him) said, 'O young people! Whoever among you can marry, should marry, because it helps him lower his gaze and guard his modesty (i.e. his private parts from committing illegal sexual intercourse etc.), and whoever is not able to marry, should fast, as fasting diminishes his sexual power.'"" (Al-Bukhari 5066)
The hadeeth orders men who are not able to marry to fast despite the hardship encountered in doing so, and not to masturbate despite the ease with which it can be done.
There is additional evidence that can be cited to support this ruling on masturbation, but due to the limited space we will not go through them here. 
Tips on how to give up masturbation
As for curing/treating the habit of masturbation, we recommend the following suggestions:
1. The motive to seek a cure for this problem should be solely following Allah's orders and fearing His punishment.
2. A permanent and quick cure from this problem lies in marriage as soon as the person is able, as shown in the Prophet's (peace and blessings be upon him) hadeeth.
3. Keeping oneself busy with what is good for this world and the Hereafter is essential in breaking this habit before it becomes second nature after which it is very difficult to rid oneself of it.
4. Lowering the gaze (from looking at forbidden things such as pictures, movies etc.) will help suppress the desire before it leads one to commit the haram (forbidden). Allah orders men and women to lower their gaze as shown in the following two verses and in the Prophet's hadith.
{Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things) and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts, etc.). That is purer for them. Verily, Allah is all-aware of what they do. And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things) and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts, etc.) ..... } (24: 30-31)
Allah's Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him) said: ""Do not follow a casual (unintentional) look (at forbidden things) with another look."" (Al-Tirmidhi, 2777) This is a general instruction by the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) to abstain from all that may sexually excite a person because it might lead him/her to commit the haram (forbidden).
5. Using one's available leisure time in worshipping Allah and increasing religious knowledge.
6. Being cautious not to develop any of the medical symptoms that may result from masturbation such as weak eyesight, weak nervous system, and/or back pain. More importantly, feelings of guilt and anxiety that can be complicated by missing obligatory prayers because of the need to shower (ghusl) after every incidence of masturbation, especially in the winter, and the invalidating of the fast.
7. Avoiding the illusion that some youth have that masturbation is permissible because it prevents them from committing illegal sexual acts such as fornication or even homosexuality, while they may not be at the gates of that immorality to begin with.
8. Strengthening one's willpower and not surrendering to the shaytan, and avoiding spending time alone as recommended by the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) when he said ""Do not spend the night alone"" Ahmad, 6919.
9.  Following the Prophet's (peace and blessings be upon him) aforementioned hadeeth and fasting when possible, because fasting will temper one's sexual desire and keep it under control. However, one should not overreact and swear by Allah not to return to the act because if one does not honor one's promise, one would be facing the consequences of not living up to one's oath to Allah. Also, note that medication to diminish one's sexual desire is strictly prohibited because it might permanently affect one's sexual ability.
10. Trying to follow the Prophet's (peace and blessings be upon him) recommendation concerning the etiquette of getting ready for bed, such as reading the well-known supplications, sleeping on the right side, and avoiding sleeping on the belly (the Prophet-peace and blessings be upon him- forbade sleeping on the belly).
11. Striving hard to be patient and chaste, because persistence will eventually, Allah willing, lead to attaining those qualities as second nature, as the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) explains in the following hadith:
""Whoever seeks chastity Allah will make him chaste, and whoever seeks help from none but Allah, He will help him, and whoever is patient He will make it easy for him, and no one has ever been given anything better than patience."" Al-Bukhari:1469.
12. If one falls into this sin, they must hasten to repent, asking forgiveness from Allah, doing good deeds, and not losing hope and feeling despair; these are all prerequisites to curing this problem. Note that losing hope is one of the major sins punishable by Allah.
13. Finally, Allah is the Most Merciful and He always responds to whoever calls on Him. So, asking for Allah's forgiveness and help will be accepted, by His will.

331,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/331,Children's Education,"Asalaamulaikum respected brother,
Insha'Allah, you may be able to help me answer these questions for a friend of mine.
What is Islam's view on the parents' (especially the father's) responsibility to educate their children? Additionally, what type or manner of education is most Islamically correct (i.e. private or public school etc.)?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Al-hamdu lillaah. Praise be to Allaah.
No doubt that a child's education is one of life's necessities, and as such spending to achieve it is obligatory on the parents. However, the level of education that a Muslim should provide for his children is not necessarily the highest level possible. This is because a child can lead a perfectly normal life with only, for example, high school education.
And as for whether private schools are better than public schools from the shari'ah (Islamic jurisprudence) standpoint, I do not think that there is a general rule by which we can favor one schooling system over the other. It all depends on the specifics of each individual case when assessed with respect to curricula, teachers' skills, and the school district credibility.
Wallaahu a'lam. And Allaah knows best.",Islam Q&A
333,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/333,Praying in a moving vehicle,Can we pray salat while in a moving car that's because there is no place to stop and pray?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Performing prayers at the right time is a trust and an obligation, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
 
""Verily, al-Salaat (the prayer) is enjoined on the believers at fixed hours."" [al-Nisaa' 4:103].
 
Delaying the prayer past its appointed time is a grave major sin, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
""So woe unto those performers of salaat (prayers) (hypocrites), who delay their salaat from their stated fixed times."" [al-Maa'oon 107:4-5]
 
Some scholars state that the person who deliberately misses one prayer and leaves it until the appointed time is over, with no excuse, is a kaafir. Claiming that one cannot find a place to pray is not a valid excuse, because either one is living on the face of the earth or not, and if one is living on the face of the earth, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""The (whole) earth has been made a mosque (or a place of prayer) and a means of purification for me, so wherever a man of my ummah may be when the time for prayer comes, let him pray."" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, no. 335)
 
 
According to a report narrated by Muslim, he said: ""The (whole) earth has been made good for me, a means of purification and a mosque (or place of prayer); so wherever a man may be when the time for prayer comes, let him pray wherever he is."" (Saheeh Muslim, no. 521)
 
The entire world is a suitable place to prostrate oneself; the scholars have made no exceptions except very few, such as graveyards and lavatories. Wherever a Muslim is when the time for prayer comes, he should pray: in a mosque, if possible, or else in a hallway or park, on a sidewalk or in a parking lot, or in a corner of a store. Even if one can find no other place than a church, it is permissible to pray in it.
 
As far as praying on board means of transportation is concerned, then it is possible to pray there so long as the necessary conditions of prayer are fulfilled, or else one can wait until one gets out of the vehicle. If waiting means that the time for the prayer will pass, then you should pray in the best way that you can. Let us assume, for example, that you are in a car or train where there is no place to pray, you cannot stop and pray at the side of the road, and the time for that prayer is running out. In such a situation, the Muslim should pray in the best way that he can, even if he is sitting in his seat and even if he is not facing the qiblah, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can"" [al-Taghaabun 64:16], and because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""If I have commanded you to do something, do as much of it as you can."" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, no. 7288)
 
An exception to be above is naafil (supererogatory) prayers offered when riding a camel, which is permissible even if one cannot get down or if one is not facing the qiblah. This is known from the report of Ibn 'Umar, who said: ""The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to pray when travelling on his camel, no matter which direction it was facing, and he would gesture with his head to indicate the movements of the night prayer, apart from the obligatory prayers, and he would pray witr on his camel too."" (Reported by al-Bukhari, 945)
 
Ibn 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: ""The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to pray voluntary (nafl) prayers when riding on his camel, no matter what direction it was facing, when he came from Makkah to Madeenah."" Then Ibn 'Umar recited this aayah (interpretation of the meaning): ""And to Allah belong the east and the west, so wherever you turn yourselves or your faces, there is the Face of Allah (and He is High above, over His Throne)"" [al-Baqarah 2:115]
 
Ibn 'Umar said: ""It was concerning this that this aayah was revealed."" (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 2883; he said, this is a saheeh hasan hadeeth)
 
We should not forget to point out here that Muslims living in non-Muslim countries sometimes delay or abandon their prayers for another, completely different, reason, which is that they feel too embarrassed to pray in front of the kuffaar in public or open places, or they are afraid that they will make fun of them and regard them as odd. This is a serious mistake. How can a Muslim feel embarrassed about proclaiming the truth and worshipping openly, hastening to fulfil the command of Allah at the time when Allah has said it is to be done? This matter has been dealt with in a similar question on this website (see question # 980). We ask Allah to help us all to remember Him, to be grateful to Him and to worship Him properly.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

Salman ibn ‘Amir narrated that Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah upon him) said: ""For a boy, there is an 'Aqiqah. So spill blood for him and remove the harm from him."" (Ahmad) He said that Ibn Sireen used to say if removing harm from him did not mean shaving the head, then I don't know what it is.
Ibn Al-Qayyim (Allah's mercy upon him) said about the benefit of shaving the newborn's hair : 

“Shaving his head removes the harm from him, 
removes the weak hair so that stronger and firmer hair replaces it and it is beneficial for the head. 
In addition, it comforts the newborn and opens the head's skin openings... 
And along with this is a strengthening of his eyesight, his sense of smell and hearing. (Ahkam al-Tifl by Ahmad Al-’Isawi 192)

Sheikh Ibn Uthaimin said: “It appears that shaving the head on that day has a positive effect on the hair roots.” (Al-Sharh Al-Mumti` 7/540)

355,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/355,Children's Character,Many people are concerned about their childrens unstable characters and the effects of luxury on their personalities. How can we introduce strength and honour into our childrens characters?,,,"Praise be to Allah.The issue referred to in the question is one of the most serious problems in raising children nowadays. Some of the Islamic solutions to this problem and ways of instilling strength and honour in our childrens character are listed below:
Takniyyah (using the kunya or patronymic in addressing children)
Calling a young boy ""Abu Foolaan"" (""Father of so-and-so) or a young girl ""Umm Foolaan"" (""Mother of so-and-so"") will make the child feel more responsible and grown up, so he will become more mature and will feel above normal childishness. The Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) used to give kunyas to children. Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: ""The Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) was the best of people in attitude and manners. I had a brother whom people used to call Abu Umayr. I think he was just past the age of weaning, and whenever he came along the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) would say to him, O Abu Umayr, what did the nughayr do (Ya Abaa Umayr ma faala al-nuhgayr)?"" (The nughayr was a small bird with which he used to play). (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 5735).
Umm Khaalid bint Khaalid reported that the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) was given some clothes, among which was a small black garment made of silk, known as a khameesah. He said, ""Who do you think I should give this to?"" The people were silent, then he said, ""Bring me Umm Khaalid"" and she was carried to him (which indicates that she was very young). He picked up the garment and put it on her, saying, ""Enjoy it until it wears out."" There was a green or yellow spot on it, and he said, ""O Umm Khaalid, this is sanaah"" sanaah means ""beautiful"" in Ethiopian. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 5375).
According to another report also narrated by al-Bukhaari: ""He looked at the khameesah and pointed to it, saying, O Umm Khaalid, this is sanaa, O Umm Khaalid, this is sanaa."" Sanaa in Ethiopian means beautiful. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 5397).
Taking them to gatherings and letting them sit with grown-ups
This will increase their understanding and wisdom, and make them try to imitate adults, as well as keeping them from spending too much time on games and entertainment. The Sahaabah used to bring their children with them when they went and sat with the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him). One of the stories that describe this was narrated by Muaawiyah ibn Qurrah from his father, who said: ""The Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) used to sit with a group of his Companions. One man had his little son with him; he would bring him from behind and make him sit in front of him"" (Reported by al-Nisaai and classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Ahkaam al-Janaaiz).
Talking to them about the heroic deeds of earlier and subsequent generations, Islamic battles and Muslim victories
This will encourage them to be brave, which is one of the most important parts of being strong and honourable. Al-Zubayr ibn al-Awwam had two children, one of whom was present at some of the battles, and the other of whom used to play with the old battle scars on his fathers shoulder. This was reported by Urwah ibn al-Zubayr, who said that the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) said to al-Zubayr on the day of Yarmook, ""Will you go and attack, and we will go with you?"" He said, ""If I attacked, you would be lying."" They said, ""No, we will do (as we promised)."" So he launched an attack (against the Romans), penetrating their ranks and passing straight through, but no one was with him. Then he turned around and came back, and the Romans seized the reins of his horse and wounded him twice in the shoulder. Between these two new wounds was a scar from a wound he had received at Badr. Urwah said, ""When I was little, I used to play by putting my fingers in those scars."" Urwah said, "" Abdullaah ibn al-Zubayr was with him on that day. He was ten years old. He (al-Zubayr) put him on a horse and entrusted him to the care of another man."" (Reported by al-Bukhari, 3678).
Commenting on this hadith, Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: ""Al-Zubayr felt that his son Abdullaah was brave and chivalrous, so he put him on a horse, but he feared that he might attempt to do more than he was able, so he put another man with him so that he could feel that he was safe from the attacks of the Romans should he become distracted by the fighting."" Ibn al-Mubaarak reported from Hishaam ibn Urwah from his father from Abdullaah ibn al-Zubayr that he was with his father on the day of Yarmook, and when the mushrikoon (pagans)ran away, he attacked and started killing their wounded, i.e., he finished off every wounded soldier whom he found. This indicates that he was strong and brave from childhood.
Teaching them good manners
Among the manners that should be taught are those described in the hadith (prophetic narration) narrated by Abu Hurayrah from the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him): ""The young should greet the old, the passerby should greet one who is sitting, and the small group should greet the larger group."" (Al-Bukhaari, 5736).
Giving them the praise and respect they deserve in front of others
This is made clear by the following hadith: Sahl ibn Sad (may Allah be pleased with him) said that the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) was brought a cup and he drank from it. There was a boy, the youngest of all the people, on his right and some elders on his left. He said, ""O young boy, will you allow me to give this to these elders?"" The boy said, ""I will not give away my share of your blessings to anyone, O Messenger of Allah,"" so he gave the cup to him. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 2180)
Teaching them manly sports
- such as archery, swimming and horse riding.
Avoiding humilating them, especially in front of others
Never belittling their ideas, and encouraging them to take part
Consulting them and asking for their opinions
Giving them responsibilities in accordance with their age and abilities
Teaching them to be brave as appropriate including how to speak in public
Making sure their clothes are modest and protecting them from inappropriate clothing, hairstyles, movements and ways of walking
Making sure that boys do not wear silk, as this is only for women
Avoiding extravagance, luxury, laziness and idleness
Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: ""Get used to a rough life, for luxury does not last forever.""
Avoiding entertainment or pastime gatherings, singing, music and other wastes of time, because these go against strength, honour and seriousness
These are some of the ways and means which will increase strength and honour, and protect our children.

'Abdullaah ibn Mas'ood (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""Those who will be most severely punished by Allah on the Day of Resurrection will be the image-makers."" (Reported by al-Bukhari, see al-Fath, 10/382).

Let him create a grain of wheat or a kernel of corn.'"" (Reported by al-Bukhari, see Fath al-Baari, 10/385).
 
'Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said: ""Shall I not send you on the same mission as the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sent me? Do not leave any built-up tomb without levelling it, and do not leave any picture in any house without erasing it."" (Reported by Muslim and al-Nisaa'i; this is the version narrated by al-Nisaa'i).
 
Ibn 'Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""Every image-maker will be in the Fire, and for every image that he made a soul will be created for him, which will be punished in the Fire."" Ibn 'Abbaas said: ""If you must do that, make pictures of trees and other inanimate objects."" (Reported by Muslim, 3/1871)
 
These ahaadeeth indicate that pictures of animate beings are haraam, whether they are humans or other creatures, whether they are three-dimensional or two-dimensional, whether they are printed, drawn, etched, engraved, carved, cast in moulds, etc. These ahaadeeth include all of these types of pictures.
 
The Muslim should submit to the teachings of Islam and not argue with them by saying, ""But I am not worshipping them or prostrating to them!"" If we think about just one aspect of the evil caused by the prevalence of photographs and pictures in our times, we will understand something of the wisdom behind this prohibition: that aspect is the great corruption caused by the provoking of physical desires and subsequent spread of immorality caused by these pictures.
 
The Muslim should not keep any pictures of animate beings in his house, because they will prevent the angels from entering. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""The angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or pictures."" (Reported by al-Bukhari, see al-Fath, 10/380).
But nowadays, unfortunately, one can even find in some Muslim homes statues of gods worshipped by the kuffaar (such as Buddha etc.) which they keep on the basis that they are antiques or decorative pieces. These things are more strictly prohibited than others, just as pictures which are hung up are worse than pictures which are not hung up, for how easily they can lead to glorification, and cause grief or be a source of boasting! We cannot say that these pictures are kept for memory's sake, because true memories of a Muslim relative or friend reside in the heart, and we remember them by praying for mercy and forgiveness for them.
Taking pictures with a camera involves human actions such as focusing, pressing the shutter, developing, printing, and so on. We cannot call it anything other than ""picture-making"" or tasweer, which is the expression used by all Arabic-speakers to describe this action.
 
In the book Al-I'laam bi naqd kitaab al-halaal wa'l-haraam, the author says: ""Photography is even more of an imitation of the creation of Allah than pictures which are engraved or drawn, so it is even more deserving of being prohibited There is nothing that could exclude photography from the general meaning of the reports."" (p. 42, see also Fataawa Islamiyyah, 4/355).
 
Among the scholars who have discussed the issue of photography is Shaykh Naasir al-Deen al-Albaani, who said: ""Some of them differentiate between hand-drawn pictures and photographic images by claiming that the latter are not products of human effort, and that no more is involved than the mere capturing of the image. This is what they claim. The tremendous energy invested the one who invented this machine that can do in few seconds what otherwise could not be done in hours does not count as human effort, according to these people! Pointing the camera, focusing it, and taking the picture, preceded by installation of the film and followed by developing and whatever else that I may not know about none of this is the result of human effort, according to them!
 
Some of them explain how this photography is done, and summarize that no less than eleven different actions are involved in the making of a picture. In spite of all this, they say that this picture is not the result of human action! Can it be permissible to hang up a picture of a man, for example, if it is produced by photography, but not if it is drawn by hand?
 
Those who say that photography is permitted have ""frozen"" the meaning of the word ""tasweer,"" restriciting it only to the meaning known at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and not adding the meaning of photography, which is ""tasweer"" or ""picture-making"" in every sense - linguistic, legal, and in its harmful effects, and as is clear from the definition mentioned above. Years ago, I said to one of them, By the same token, you could allow idols which have not been carved but have been made by pressing a button on some machine that turns out idols by the dozen. What do you say to that?""
(Aadaab al-Zafaaf by al-Albaani, p. 38)
 
It is also worth quoting the opinion of some contemporary scholars who allow the taking of photographs but say that the pictures should not be kept: ""The angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or pictures."" (See al-Sharh al-Mumti', 2/198).
 
There are many bad things involved in the making of pictures. Besides the element of imitating the creation of Allah - which is an accusation denied by many of those who make pictures - reality bears witness to the great extent of immorality and provocation of desires caused by the prevalence of pictures and picture-making nowadays. We must remove or blot out every picture, except when it is too difficult to do so, like the pictures which are overwhelmingly prevalent in food packaging, or pictures used in encyclopaedias and reference books. We should remove what we can, and be careful about any provocative pictures that may be found.
 
""So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can"" [al-Taghaabun 64:16 - interpretation of the meaning]
 
Photographs which are essential are permitted - such as those required for identity documents, or for identifying or pursuing criminals [e.g. ""wanted"" posters and the like - translator's note], or for educational purposes which cannot be achieved otherwise. The principle in sharee'ah is that we should not exaggerate about what is necessary.

Passing the Black Stone and acknowledging it, after praying two rak’ahs of Tawaaf

proven to be part of the saheeh Sunnah, but it is mustahabb (encouraged), not waajib 
(obligatory), so there is nothing wrong with not doing it.
The proof (daleel) that it is in accordance with the Sharee’ah is the hadeeth of Jaabir

of the Prophet 
:
"". . . Then he went back to the Rukn (the corner of the Ka’bah where the Black Stone 
is situated) and acknowledged it, then he went out through the gate towards 
al-Safaa’.""
Al-Tirmidhi reported from Jaabir that: ""When the Prophet 
 came to Makkah, he 
entered the Mosque and acknowledged the Black Stone, then he passed to the right of 
it and ran for three (circuits of Tawaaf) and walked for four. Then he came to 
al-Maqaam and said: ‘Take Maqaam Ibraaheem as a place of prayer.’ He prayed two 
rak’ahs with the Maqaam between him and the House (Ka’bah).’ Then he came to the 
(Black Stone) after praying two rak’ahs and acknowledged it. Then he went out to 
Safaa’ and I think he said, ‘Safaa’ and Marwa are of the Symbols of Allaah 
[al-Baqarah 2:158].’"" (Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 784). 
Al-Tirmidhi said: The hadeeth of Jaabir is a saheeh hasan hadeeth and the scholars 
ruled that we should act in accordance with it).
Al-Nawawi, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: ""This is evidence in favour of the 
opinion of al-Shaafi’i and other scholars, that after performing Tawaaf al-Qudoom 
(the Tawaaf of Arrival) and praying behind the Maqaam, a person should go back to 
the Black Stone and acknowledge it, then go out through the Gate of Safaa to perform 
al-Saa’iee. The scholars agree that this acknowledgement is not obligatory, but it is 
Sunnah; the one who does not do it is not obliged to offer a sacrifice in 
compensation. (Saheeh Muslim bi Sharh al-Nawawi, 8/428).

    was reported from the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Even
    though there is some weakness in this hadeeth (i.e. in its isnaad), this is what the ummah
    has done and it is well known that when the imaam comes and gets up on the minbar, he
    greets the people with salaam. (Reported by al-Shubi). Abu Bakr and Umar used
    to do this. Reported by Abd al-Razzaaq , Ibn Abi Shaybah, 2/114, Ibn Maajah and
    al-Tabaraani. It was also reported by al-Bayhaqi from Jaabir ibn Umar, narrating
    from the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), then he said: a report
    concerning this was narrated from Ibn Abbaas from Umar ibn Abd
    al-Azeez. Then the shaykh said in his commentary: it is not permitted to speak when
    the imaam is delivering the khutbah, it is only permitted before and after the khutbah,
    even after the khateeb has arrived and after the adhaan, so long as the khateeb has not
    started his khutbah. (Ibn Uthaymeen, Al-Sharh al-Muttabi li Zaad
    al-Mustanfi, 5/78). [?? Makath ??] is well known, from which we know that it is
    obligatory to return the greeting of salaam, so in this case we understand that it is not
    forbidden to speak. And Allaah knows best. 
    Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni: When the imaam faces the
    people, he greets them with salaam and they respond, then he sits down. Then he
    mentioned the hadeeth quoted above, and others. Then he said (may Allaah have mercy on

372,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/372,Obligation of changing one's name upon accepting Islaam,Is it mandatory for one who newly embraces Islaam to change his or her name?,,,"Praise be to Allah.al-hamdu lillaah.
He or she is not required to change his or her name unless it embodies the worship of someone or 
something other then God, Allaah. However, its amelioration by choosing a new Islamic name is 
legitimate and encouraged. The fact that he or she would change his or her name from a pagan or 
non-Islamic name to an Islamic one would be considered commendable--however, it is not mandatory.
Thus, if one's name is Abdul-Messiah, for example, or similar such names, then he is obligated to 
change it, as the Prophet  (peace upon him) had people with the names Abdul-Ka'bah and 
Abdul-Uzzah change their names upon accepting Islaam. 
If the original name does not comprise or imply anything forbidden in Islaam, then he or she is permitted 
to retain it (such as the name George, for example). As noted, though, it is preferable to change it to an 
Islaamic name, as this also distinguishes him or her from the kuffaar. 
Note that if changing one's name in official documents and records poses a great inconvenience, it 
would suffice to change it among the people. In this case, he or she is called by his or her new name by 
friends, acquaintances, and the general public, while offical documents would retain the original given 
name.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
373,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/373,"A woman who committed adultery and is contemplating 
suicide","A married woman commits adultery, then she repented but the guilt of the act is haunting her. She is now
thinking about suicide. What should be done and what is your advice?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
Ibn Mas'ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: ""The believer sees his 
sin as a mountain beneath which he is sitting and which he fears may fall 
down upon him. The rebellious person sees his sin as a fly which passes in 
front of his nose and he swats it away"" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 6308)
This woman's overwhelming sense of the burden of her sin is a sign of 
faith. We offer her the following advice:
She should examine her divorce from her first husband to make sure 
that it is sound according to sharee'ah (Islamic law), whether it took the 
form of talaaq (male-instigated divorce) or khul' (female-instigated 
divorce).
She should make sure that her marriage contract to the second man is 
also sound, because a marriage between two people guilty of adultery is 
not valid unless they have repented (see questions # 33); if the contract 
is found not to be valid, it must be repeated.
If this woman is sincere in her repentance towards Allaah, regrets what 
she did and is determined never to do it again, Allaah will forgive all 
her sins, no matter how great they were, so she should not despair of 
the mercy of Allaah, for no one despairs of Allaah's Mercy, except the 
people who disbelieve, and who despairs of the mercy of his Lord 
except those who are astray?
She should hasten to do many good deeds, to expiate for her sin, as 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""And perform al-salaat (the 
prayer) at the two ends of the day and in some hours of the night. 
Verily, the good deeds remove the evil deeds"" [Hud 11:114]
She should resume a pure Islamic life, based on purity and chastity. 
Suicide is not a solution at all, as it is one of the most grievous of major 
sins, and will only increase the punishment of the one who does it. The 
Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
""Whoever throws himself down from a high mountain and kills himself 
will be throwing himself down from a mountain in the Fire of Hell for 
all eternity. Whoever takes poison and kills himself will be taking 
poison in the Fire of Hell for all eternity. Whoever kills himself with a 
weapon (literally, iron) will be holding it in his hand and stabbing 
himself in the stomach in the Fire of Hell for all eternity. (Reported by 
al-Bukhaari, 5778)

and to include her in His Mercy, for He is the All-hearing Who answers

I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT KEEPING PETS IN THE HOUSE.I KNOW 
THAT THE KALB(DOG)IS CONSIDERED NIJASA, BUT I DON'T KNOW 
WHY.
I REMEMBER A SECTION IN THE Qur'an WHERE THE PROPHET PEACE 
BE UPON HIM ONCE GAVE A THIRSTY DOG WATER TO DRINK OR 
SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT. 
COULD YOU PLEASE ELABORATE.
THANK YOU",,,"Praise be to Allah.
According to Islaamic Shareeah, it is not permitted to keep a dog except within 
narrowly-defined limits, as the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
explained: ""Whoever keeps a dog, his good deeds will decrease every day by one qeeraat (a 
unit of measurement), unless it is a dog for farming or herding."" According to another report: "". 
. . unless it is a dog for herding sheep, farming or hunting."" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, 2322)
Dogs are extremely naajis (impure, unclean). The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
upon him) said: ""If a dog drinks from the vessel of any one of you, let him wash it seven times"" 
(reported by Muslim, no. 279). According to another report: "". . . and clean it the eighth time with 
earth."" (Saheeh Muslim, no. 280).
It is forbidden in Islaam to sell a dog and to receive payment for it, as is reported in Saheeh 
al-Bukhaari from Abu Masoud al-Ansaari: the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of 
Allaah be upon him) forbade (accepting) the price of a dog. (al-Fath, no. 2237)
The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us not to resemble dogs by 
placing our forearms on the ground during sujood (prostration), as in reported in the hadeeth 
narrated by Anas ibn Maalik, according to which the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah 
be upon him) said: ""Do sujood properly; none of you should spread his forearms like a dog 
does."" (al-Bukhaari, Fath, no. 822).
Whoever keeps a dog in his house is denied the blessing of the angels presence in his house, 
as the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""The angels 
do not enter a house in which there is a dog."" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 3225).
Keeping dogs nowadays is the habit of the kuffaar, who adopt them as friends, kiss them, let 
them lick them and their clothes, sleep with them and even leave them money in their wills. 
Keeping a dog is an imitation of the kuffaar. Some Muslims may claim that they need to keep a 
dog at home for purposes of protection, to which we respond that nowadays there are burglar 
alarm systems and other measures one may take for security purposes, and there is no need to 
keep a dog, praise be to Allaah.
It only remains for us to say that the fact that it is forbidden to keep a dog and interect closely 
with it does not mean that we should not be kind or feel compassion towards dogs if we see 
them in a pitiful state. These are two entirely separate matters. The Prophet 
 (peace and 
blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us that ""a man saw a dog biting the dust because of 
thirst, so he took his shoe and started to scoop water up with it until the dogs thirst was 
quenched. Allaah appreciated his good deed and granted him entry to Paradise for it."" 
(Reported by al-Bukhaari, no. 174). 
According to another report, the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
""Whilst a man was walking he became very thirsty, so he went down to a well and drank from 
it. When he came out, he saw a dog panting and biting the soil because of thirst. The man said, 
He is suffering the same as I suffered, so he filled his shoe (with water), came out and let the 
dog drink until his thirst was quenched. Allaah appreciated his good deed and forgave him 
because of it."" The people asked, ""O Messenger of Allaah, will we be rewarded for how we 
treat animals?"" He said, ""In every living thing there is a reward."" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, Fath, no. 
2363).
We do not want to omit reminding you of the importance of reading the Quraan properly and 
referring to it. You say in your question that the story of the thirsty dog is in the Quraan, and 
that is not the case, as it is reported in the Sunnah.

I believe that there is only Allah (one God). Ibelieve that Muhammed is the seal of the prophets. History bears this out. My question is: How do I declare this (shahadah) if I do not speak arabic?  How do I perform the five daily prayers (salah) without understanding arabic? Finally would I have to change my name?,,,"Praise be to Allah.To the dear inquirer:I welcome you with a warm greeting.  I was besieged with great joy as I discovered your question while browsing through the ten questions which arrived during the past hour today, and it was the dearest question for me.  This fact is not surprising, as how could our hearts not open to a wise man who has discovered the truth and has acknowledged and confirmed it for himself--one who wishes to embrace Islaam and asks about the next steps?
In reality, everything that poses a problem for you is actually an easy matter, and can be solved simply, God willing (in shaa' Allaah), so let's take them one by one:

First:  all that is required of you to embrace this religion right now as you are reading these lines is to pronounce al-shahaadatain, or the two confirmations and attestations of faith, to the best of your ability.  Perfect pronunciation of the Arabic letters is not required, and the following is a transliteration of the phrases with English letters to help you:

ash-hadu an laa ilaahah illallaah (I bear witness and attest that there is no god worthy of worship but the One God Allaah)
ash-hadu anna muhammad-ar-rasool ullaah (I bear  witness and attest that Muhammad is the messenger of Allaah)
After pronouncing them, you should promptly hasten to take a shower to purify yourself and prepare to start performing your regular prayers which will be an obligation as soon as you have declared your belief.

Second:  If you have not yet learned the manner and characteristics of performing the prayer (i.e. at least the movements and positions), appended to this message is a description from which you can learn.  What is requried from you for the time being is to say in the beginning of the prayer and between each movement between positions ""Allaahu ak-bar"" (a glorification of Allaah).  While standing, bowing, prostrating, and sitting, you should say ""subhaan allaah wal-hamdu lillaah wa-laa ilaaha illallaahu wallaahu akbar.""  (Glory be to Allaah, and praise and thanks be to Allaah, and there is no god but Allaah, and Allaah is the most Exalted and Great.)  Then conclude the prayer by turning your head to the right then left, each time saying ""as-salaamu alaikum.""


This way of performing salaat is permissible for you until you can learn and memorize what should be said in each movement and position of the salaat.


Third:  You are not required to change your name, and in fact, a number of scholars among the forefathers and modern-day Muslims have indicated declared that your name is in fact the name of one of the prophets!
