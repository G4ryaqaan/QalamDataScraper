    We ask Allaah to make you steadfast in your efforts to fulfil 
    the duty of calling people to Allaah and in your keenness to spread good. 
    Your love of good and your efforts to spread it indicate that you are a good 
    person, in sha Allah. We ask Allaah that you will be included in His words 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “You (true believers in Islamic Monotheism, and real 
    followers of Prophet Muhammad and his Sunnah) are the best of peoples ever 
    raised up for mankind; you enjoin Al-Ma‘roof (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and 
    all that Islam has ordained) and forbid Al‑Munkar (polytheism, disbelief and 
    all that Islam has forbidden), and you believe in Allaah”

    [Aal ‘Imraan 3:110]
Your saying that you love 
    Allaah is the characteristic of those whom Allaah loves, of whom He says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “a people whom He will love and they will love Him”

    [al-Maa'idah 5:54]

    Whoever loves Allaah sincerely, Allaah will love him. The 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “Whoever loves to meet Allaah, Allaah loves to meet him.” (Narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari, 6507; Muslim, 2683). 

    Al-Bukhaari (7375) and Muslim (813) narrated from ‘Aa’ishah 
    (may Allaah be pleased with her) that the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) sent a man on a campaign; when he led his companions 
    in prayer, he used to end his recitation with Qul Huwa Allaah Ahad. 
    When they came back, they mentioned that to the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him). He told them, ‘Ask him why he does that.” 
    He said, “Because it speaks of the Most Merciful and I love to recite it.” 
    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Tell him 
    that Allaah loves him.” This man loved the attributes of Allaah, so Allaah 
    loved him. 

    If you want to know how sincere your love for Allaah is, then 
    examine yourself in the light of the following verse, in which Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Say (O Muhammad to mankind): If you (really) love Allaah, 
    then follow me (i.e. accept Islamic Monotheism,
    follow the Qur’aan and the Sunnah), 
    Allaah will love you and forgive you your sins”

    [Aal ‘Imraan 3:31]

    i.e., follow the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him). 

    If Allaah loves you, you may receive the glad tidings of 
    great goodness. Allaah says in a hadeeth qudsi: “Whoever shows enmity to 
    someone devoted to Me, I shall be at war with him. My slave draws noy near 
    to Me with anything more beloved to Me than the religious duties I have 
    enjoined on him, and My slave continues to draw near to Me with 
    supererogatory works so that I shall love him. When I love him I am his 
    hearing with which he hears, his seeing with which he sees, his hand with 
    which he strikes and his foot with which he walks. Were he to ask something 
    of Me, I would surely give it to him, and were he to ask Me for refuge, I 
    would surely grant him it. I do not hesitate about anything so much as I 
    hesitate about [seizing] the soul of My faithful slave: he hates death and I 
    hate hurting him.”

    (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6502). 

    The following are six benefits that a person gains by loving 
    Allaah, in order of importance: 

    1-Allah becomes his hearing, 
    i.e., he does not listen to anything except that which pleases Allaah.

    2-Allaah becomes his seeing, 
    i.e., he does not look at anything but that which pleases Allaah.

    3-Allaah becomes his foot with 
    which he walks, i.e., he does not walk for anything except that which is 
    pleasing to Allaah,

    4-Allaah becomes his hand with 
    which he strikes, i.e., he does not take revenge for himself but rather for 
    the sake of Allaah, so he does not do anything with his hand except that 
    which pleases Allaah.

    5-Allaah answers his du’aa’s

    6-Allaah grants him refuge from 
    everything that he dislikes.

    So congratulation to those whom Allaah loves, to the close 
    friends of Allaah, to the party of Allaah.  

    “They are the party of Allaah. Verily, it is the party of 
    Allaah that will be the successful” 

    [al-Mujaadilah 58:22]
With regard to 
    istikhaarah, it is prescribed when a person is thinking about doing 
    something, then he hesitates about it. But with regard the thing that you 
    are doing, namely calling people to Allaah, there is no need to pray 
    istikhaarah, rather you should go ahead and call people to Allaah with 
    wisdom and beautiful preaching. 

    With regard to the bad dream that you saw, it is from the 
    Shaytaan. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    taught us, if we see something good in our dreams, to tell those whom we 
    love about it, but if we see something bad, we should seek refuge with 
    Allaah from the Shaytaan and spit drily to the left three times, then turn 
    over onto the other side, and we should not pay attention to that bad dream.

31771,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/31771,“Help us to buy winter blankets”,"There are some charities which collect money for people living in cold countries, using the slogan, “Help us to buy winter blankets” for example. But they may spend some of the money to buy things other than the blankets that those poor people need. Is the purpose the same?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    It would be better if the slogan used by this charity said 
    something like “Winter aid” or “Winter protection”, so that it could apply 
    to blankets, clothes, stoves, etc. 

    With regard to money that has been collected for a specific 
    purpose, it should only be spent on that specific thing, unless it is too 
    difficult to do so. 

    For example, we collected money to buy winter blankets for a 
    specific village, and half of the amount was sufficient to buy the blankets, 
    but they also need clothes or heating. In this case there is nothing wrong 
    with spending the left-over money to meet their other needs. But if this was 
    a general appeal, and people are in need of blankets, it is not permissible 
    to spend the money collected in any other way. 

    So it is not appropriate to spend the money that was 
    collected for blankets on anything else, unless it is well known among the 
    people that “winter blankets” includes all kinds of help in winter. Hence 
    the slogan should be changed to “Winter aid” or something similar.

31773,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/31773,Ruling on kissing one’s wife in front of the children,"What amount of affection can a husband and wife display in front of their children . Can they hug, kiss lightly, hold hands in front of their children?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The Islamic ruling on this matter is as follows: 

    Firstly: If this hugging and kissing is of the type that 
    takes place between husband and wife when they are alone, then it is not 
    permissible to do it in front of the children whether they are little or 
    big. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “O you who believe! Let your slaves and slave‑girls, and 
    those among you who have not come to the age of puberty ask your permission 
    (before they come to your presence) on three occasions: before Fajr 
    (morning) Salaah (prayer), and while you put off your clothes for the 
    noonday (rest), and after the ‘Isha’ (night) Salaah (prayer). (These) three 
    times are of privacy for you; other than these times there is no sin on you 
    or on them to move about, attending to each other. Thus Allaah makes clear 
    the Ayaat (the Verses of this Qur’aan, showing proofs for the legal aspects 
    of permission for visits) to you. And Allaah is All‑Knowing, All‑Wise.

    59. And when the children among you come to puberty, then 
    let them (also) ask for permission, as those senior to them (in age). Thus 
    Allaah makes clear His Ayaat (Commandments and legal obligations) for you. 
    And Allaah is All‑Knowing, All‑Wise”

    [al-Noor 24:58-59]
Ibn Katheer said: Here 
    servants and children are commanded not to intrude upon the adults of the 
    household at these times, lest the man be in a position of intimacy with his 
    wife and so on. (3/401). 

    If children are obliged to seek permission lest they see 
    something of that which takes place between husband and wife, then what 
    about doing such things openly in a deliberate manner? Look at the etiquette 
    that was observed in the household of the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) and how the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with 
    them) transmitted the details of his life. 

    The following was narrated from the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) concerning that: 

    It was narrated from Kurayb the freed slave of ‘Abd-Allaah 
    ibn ‘Abbaas that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Abbaas told him that he stayed overnight 
    with Maymoonah, the wife of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him), who was his maternal aunt. He said: I lay my head on the end 
    of the pillow and the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) and his wife placed their heads on its side. The 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) slept 
    until midnight, or shortly before or after, then the Messenger of Allaah 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) woke and started to rub the 
    sleep from his eyes with his hands. Then he recited the last ten verses of 
    Aal ‘Imraan… 

    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4571; Muslim, 763. 

    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: This indicates 
    that it is permissible for a man to sleep alongside his wife without being 
    intimate with her in the presence of one of her mahrams, even if he has 
    reached the age of discernment. Al-Qaadi said: In some versions of this 
    hadeeth it says: Ibn ‘Abbaas said: I stayed overnight with my maternal aunt 
    one night when she was menstruating. Even though the isnaad of this version 
    is not saheeh, it contains a very interesting idea, because Ibn ‘Abbaas 
    would not have asked to stay overnight on a night when the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) may have wanted to be intimate 
    with his wife, and his father would not have sent him there unless he knew 
    that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would have 
    no need to be intimate with his wife – because it is well known that he 
    would not have been intimate with her when Ibn ‘Abbaas was there sharing the 
    same pillow with them and he was watching to see what the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did, and he did not sleep or he 
    only slept a little. 

    Sharh Muslim, 6/46 

    In addition, doing such things openly is an action that is 
    contrary to honour and decency. 
Al-Maawardi said: Honour 
    and decency means making sure that one’s deeds befit the circumstances so 
    that no deeds may appear abhorrent or blameworthy. 

    Adab al-Dunya wa’l-Deen, 392. 

    The negative effects that such behaviour has on the 
    children’s upbringing is sufficient reason not to do it, for children are 
    created with the natural instinct to imitate their parents in all their 
    affairs. So there is the fear that one of them may try to do that out of 
    ignorance and a lack of understanding of what he is doing, and this is bad 
    enough. Moreover there is no guarantee that small children talk to others 
    about what they have seen, and it is obvious that this will cause 
    embarrassment and loss of geerah (protective jealousy) 

    Secondly: If the affection that the husband and wife show in 
    front of the children is of the kind that is usually shown, namely 
    compassion, kindness and care, which will fill the house with peace and 
    respect and happiness, especially on occasions such as Eid etc, that is 
    permissible. 

    Showing that kind of affection will have an effect on the children’s peace of mind and will make them sense that there is mutual understanding and harmony in their family. There is nothing wrong with showing that kind of affection, but only as much as is necessary and without doing anything that is forbidden. And Allaah knows best.",Islam Q&A

When the man speaks the words of divorce, or writes them down, this is regarded as a valid divorce that takes effect, even if the wife does not know of it. 
If your husband has completed divorce proceedings with a lawyer then this divorce is valid and effective. Please see questions  9593 and 20660. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: 
A man has been away from his wife for a long time, and he had divorced her to himself, even though he did not inform her of that. Has divorce taken place? 
He replied: 
The divorce has taken place, even if he did not convey that to his wife. If a man utters the words of divorce and says, “I divorce my wife”, the wife is divorced whether she knows it or not. Hence if we assume that the wife does not come to know of this divorce until after she has had three menstrual cycles, then her ‘iddah is complete even if she did not know. Similarly if a man dies and his wife does not come to know of his death until after the end of the ‘iddah period, then she does not have to observe ‘iddah because in this case it is already over.

Quitting a job for the sake of Allah


Will your children die of starvation if you quit a haram job?


Stories from the life of `Umar ibn `Abd al-`Aziz","Praise be to Allah.Can you work for a company that cheats?
If your work involves helping the company in any way with any kind of cheating or stealing, then it is not permissible. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Help you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression.” [Al-Maidah 5:2]
But if your work has nothing to do with the haram things, and the company also has some other departments that do not deal with haram things , then it is permissible for you to work in the departments that deal with permissible things, subject to the condition mentioned above, which is that there should be no helping anyone to do anything haram. 
Is it permissible to work in riba-based institutions?
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“It is not permissible to work in riba-based institutions even as a driver or guard, because taking up employment with a riba-based institution implies that one approves of it. A person who hates something could never agree to work in its interests, so if he works in its interests, that means he approves of it, and the one who approves of something haram has a share of its sin. 
But if he is directly involved in recording, sending and depositing, etc., then he is undoubtedly involved directly with the haram thing. It was proven from the hadith of Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed the one who consumes riba , the one who pays it, the two who witness it and the one who writes it down, and he said: “They are all the same.” (Fatawa Islamiyyah, 2/401) 
What you have to do is to denounce those who are in charge of the haram departments , and advise them to give up these dealings. You also have to advise the purchasers, if you can, and tell them of the faults present in the products that they are buying. 
Quitting a job for the sake of Allah
With regard to the issue of there being no other work, this is a whisper (waswasah) from the Shaytan. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And whosoever fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine” [Al-Talaq 65:2-3]
There are many kinds of permissible work. So you have to put your trust in Allah and avoid that which is haram. 
Will your children die of starvation if you quit a haram job?
With regard to the idea of your children dying of starvation, we ask you: is it better for them to die of starvation – assuming that they do die – or for you to enter Hell for their sake? 
Moreover, Allah is the One Who has created them, and He is the One Who has guaranteed to provide for them, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And in the heaven is your provision, and that which you are promised.” [Al-Dhariyat 51:22] 
“And kill not your children for fear of poverty. We shall provide for them as well as for you. Surely, the killing of them is a great sin.” [Al-Isra 17:31]
Allah has decreed the provision of each person before he emerges from his mother’s womb, so do not fear that Allah may reduce your provision, rather fear your own self that is inclined to evil and tempts you to commit sin. Remember the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “There is no flesh that is nourished from haram sources, but the Fire is more suited to it.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, no. 614; classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi) 
Stories from the life of `Umar ibn `Abd al-`Aziz 
There follow some stories from the life of the Rightly-Guided Caliph `Umar ibn `Abd al-`Aziz (may Allah have mercy on him): 
Some apples were brought to `Umar ibn `Abd al-`Aziz for the bayt al-mal (treasury) of the Muslims, and a small son of his took an apple. He snatched it back from him by force and the child ran to his mother, crying. She sent someone to the marketplace to buy him an apple. When ‘Umar went back home, he noticed the smell of apples and said, “O Fatimah, have you taken anything from this wealth?” She said, “No,” and told him that she had bought an apple for her son with her own money. ‘Umar said: “By Allah, when I snatched it from him it was as if I was snatching it from my own heart, but I would not like to condemn myself before Allah for the sake of an apple from the wealth of the Muslims.” (Manaqib `Umar ibn `Abd al-`Aziz by Ibn al-Jawzi, p. 190) 
`Umar ibn `Abd al-`Aziz entered upon his daughters after ‘Isha prayer to greet them, and when they realized he was there, they put their hands over their mouths and moved away from him. He said to their guardian, “What is the matter with them?” She said: “They did not have anything to eat for dinner apart from lentils and onions, and they don’t want you to smell that from their mouths.” So ‘Umar wept then he said to his daughters, “O my daughters, what will it benefit you if you live a life of luxury but your father ends up in Hell?” Then they wept loudly. (`Umar ibn `Abd al-`Aziz by Dr. al-Burunu, 142)  
`Umar ibn `Abd al-`Aziz was rebuked, when he was dying, of leaving his children poor. He sent for them and there were over a dozen males. He looked at them and his eyes filled with tears, then he said: “O my sons, your father has been given the choice between two things, either you will be rich and your father will enter the Fire, or you will be poor and your father will enter Paradise. If you are poor and your father enters Paradise, that is dearer to him than your being rich and your father entering Hell. Get up, may Allah protect you.”

    Your question this morning brought us good news and made us 
    very happy. Praise be to Allaah for what we have read in your question. We 
    understand the difficulties that you are facing and how you feel. We will 
    try to offer you some solutions to the problems you are facing. We are 
    impressed by your learning all the words of the prayer and of al-Faatihah 
    even though your language is English, and by your knowing Allaah since the 
    age of eleven and your becoming more convinced and certain of Islam after 
    three years, now that you are fourteen. We tell you the following, and 
    Allaah is the Source of strength: 

    When a person believes in something, he will be prepared to 
    make sacrifices for its sake, so how about if this thing is Tawheed or 
    belief in Allaah Alone, worshipping Him alone, following His Messenger and 
    obeying His commands? Undoubtedly in this case the sacrifices will be even 
    greater. The Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told 
    us that Paradise is surrounded with obstacles, and what that means is that 
    there is no way for us to reach Paradise except by overcoming obstacles and 
    putting up with difficulties. For the reward of Allaah is precious and its 
    blessings are immense and never-ending, and life there is eternal and its 
    joys and pleasures will never cease. So the true Muslim will be prepared to 
    sacrifice many things in this transient, passing world for the sake of that 
    blessing; he will be prepared to put up with the insults and slander of 
    people, with their criticism and mockery, for the sake of attaining that 
    blessing. There is something else good about this matter, which is that the 
    more a person is harassed and bears it with patience, the more his reward 
    will increase and the higher he will rise in status before the Lord of the 
    Worlds; indeed, his faith may increase and grow stronger, so that he will 
    enjoy bearing this bitterness with patience for the sake of earning Allaah’s 
    pleasure. The sweetness of striving to please the Lord cancels out the 
    bitterness of people’s anger, insults and criticism. If the harm he faces is 
    just some words of mockery or criticism that he heard, what is wrong with 
    his putting up with that in order to earn the pleasure of the Lord and His 
    reward? In all of that he believes in the promise of Allaah, as He said in 
    his holy Book (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “So be patient. Surely, the (good) end is for the 
    Muttaqoon (the pious)”

    [Hood 11:49]
He knows that patience 
    can only be achieved by the help of Allaah, so he asks Him to help him and 
    make him steadfast. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And endure you patiently (O Muhammad), your patience is 
    not but from Allaah”

    [al-Nahl 16:127]

    He is prepared to announce the truth before people, 
    regardless of who approves and who rejects that. If they reject it, he turns 
    away from them and ignores them, as Allaah said to His Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) (interpretation of the meanings): 

    “Therefore proclaim openly (Allaah’s Message  
    Islamic Monotheism) that which you are commanded, and turn away from 
    Al‑Mushrikoon (polytheists, idolaters, and disbelievers)”

    [al-Hijr 15:94]

    “and turn away from the foolish”

    [al-A’raaf 7:199]

    Hurtful words from relatives are difficult to bear, worse 
    than a blow from a weapon, but that will become insignificant for one who 
    bears in mind the greatness of Allaah and His reward, and he will continue 
    on his path without turning away or hesitating. 

    Having explained this, we will now answer your question with 
    the following points: 

    1 – You have done well by not raising your voice to your 
    grandmother, because respecting parents and grandparents is part of Islam. 

    2 – Try to resist going to the church as much as you can, 
    because it is a place where the signs of Allaah are rejected and shirk 
    (association of others with Allaah) is proclaimed and a false religion is 
    practiced openly. Since you are female, you are not obliged to go to the 
    mosque as men are, so you will not be falling short if you do not go to the 
    mosque, because the best place for a woman to pray is in her own house. 

    3 – Try as much as you can to wear hijaab, and put up with 
    insults for the sake of Allaah. Be patient in praying the five daily prayers 
    on time, knowing that they do not all coincide with the time you must be in 
    school. If you pray Fajr after dawn comes, then you go to school, you will 
    be able to pray Zuhr at school before the time for ‘Asr comes.  You could 
    find the time for that in a break between classes or at lunchtime, or after 
    coming home. It is important to pray Zuhr after the sun has passed its 
    zenith and before the time for ‘Asr comes. 

    4 – If you treat people kindly, you will win them over in the 
    end and you will not be rejected, in sha Allaah. 

    5 – Do not delay entering Islam, do not wait a moment longer. 
    For you do not know when death will come. So utter the words of the 
    Shahaadatayn (the twin declaration of faith) and start praying. You will get 
    used to the number of rak’ahs and the times of prayer, the words to say and 
    how to do it as time goes by, and this will dispel the confusion that you 
    mention in your question. So long as you are prepared to enter Islam, you do 
    not – praise be to Allaah – need the approval of your mother or grandmother, 
    or anyone else, because Allaah has commanded you to follow His religion: 

    “And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will 
    never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers”

    [Aal ‘Imraan 3:85]
6 – Look for Muslim 
    sisters with whom you can make friends and be in touch, so that they can 
    help you to learn the religion and remain steadfast in following it. There 
    follows the telephone number of al-Muntada al-Islami in London, so you can 
    call them and ask about the times of women’s classes; this may be a starting 
    point for you, since you live in the U.K.

    Finally, we want to say again how happy we were to read your 
    question, and we give you the glad tidings of a happy life and good future 
    in the shade of the pure monotheistic religion of Islam. We are prepared to 
    help you as much as we can. 
May Allaah help us and you to do that which He loves and which pleases Him. And Allaah is the Guide to the Straight Path.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
