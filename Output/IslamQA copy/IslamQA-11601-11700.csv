11609,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11609,Eating beef that has not been slaughtered properly until after it has been killed,"I am presently residing in Canada. I have learned that in this country, in the province that I live in (ontario), the animals for beef etc..are killed then slaughtered. 

So this will defeat the purpose of any muslim eating this meat.  Since, the animal is dead before it is slaughtered.  Some say we can eat the meat in Canada becaue these pple here are ahlul kitab.  So, my question is when invited and eating at a muslim family's home who believes that they can go to the local supper market and buy the meat and eat from it. And insist the meat is halal to be eaten....what must I do? Should I just eat the meat even though I know they buy from the local supper market? I have tried telling them in a nice manner, directly, but they insist that the meat is halal.  I am a new muslim and they have been very supportive in my hard times.  

I do not want to just snob them or not visit them due to my fears. What is my obligation and can I eat the meat??? Please help, most lecturers and scholars that come here, keep insisting that the question has been answered and never answer it for us new muslim.  And I have done my research as far as what I can do and not do and I am really not sure on this",,,"Praise be to Allah.Beef that has been killed before being slaughtered (i.e., before its 
          neck is cut in the halaal method) is considered to be maytah 
          (“dead meat”) and it is not permissible to eat it, because Allaah says 
          (interpretation of the meaning):  
“He has forbidden you only Al Maitah 
          (meat of a dead animal), blood, the flesh of swine, and any animal which 
          is slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allaah (or has been slaughtered 
          for idols or on which Allaah’s Name has not been mentioned while slaughtering). 
          But if one is forced by necessity, without wilful disobedience, and 
          not transgressing,   then, Allaah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful 
          
[al-Nahl 16:115]  
With regard to what you mention about some Muslims eat meating that 
          has been killed before being slaughtered, it may be that they are sure 
          that the meat that they are eating has been slaughtered according to 
          sharee’ah, or it may be that they are ignorant of the rulings on this 
          kind of meat, or they may have asked (scholars) who told them that this 
          meat is halaal.  
Whatever the case, you have to avoid eating these meats, and if anyone 
          asks you to eat it, you should refuse to do so, and explain why you 
          are refusing – so that they will follow that or at least excuse you 
          for not eating it.  
With regard to what you mention about some people saying that it is 
          permissible to eat this meat because they are the People of the Book, 
          the answer is that it is permissible to eat meat that has been slaughtered 
          by the People of the Book, but this meat that you describe is not meat 
          that has been slaughtered by them; rather it is dead meat, and it is 
          not permissible to eat dead meat even if it was killed by a Muslim.  
          
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:  
          
“Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  
‘Made 
          lawful to you this day are At Tayyibaat [all kinds of Halaal (lawful) 
          foods, which Allaah has made lawful (meat of slaughtered eatable animals, 
          milk products, fats, vegetables and fruits)]. The food (slaughtered 
          cattle, eatable animals) of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) 
          is lawful to you and yours is lawful to them’
[al-Maa’idah 5:5]  
This aayah makes it clear to us that the food of the People of the 
          Book – i.e., the Jews and Christians – is permissible for us, but if 
          we know that they have slaughtered a permissible animal in a manner 
          other than that prescribed in sharee’ah, such as killing it by strangulation, 
          electric shock, hitting it on the head, etc., then it is meat “which 
          has been killed by strangling, or by a violent blow” (cf. al-Maa'idah 
          5:3), so it is haraam, just as meat which has been killed by strangling, 
          or by a violent blow by a Muslim is also forbidden to us. But if we 
          do not know what is the case, then the meat slaughtered by them is halaal 
          for us, in accordance with the aayah.”

In conclusion, we hope that

Islam means submitting to Allaah and not 
          objecting to His commands. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
          
“It 
          is not for a believer, man or woman, when Allaah and His Messenger have 
          decreed a matter that they should have any option in their decision”

          of the prayer: 
“Verily, 
          As Salaah (the prayer) is enjoined on the believers at fixed hours” 
          [al-Nisaa’ 4:103]  
The wahy (revelation, i.e., Qur’aan and 
          Sunnah) described the times of prayer in both word and deed. This is 
          how the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
          of Allaah be upon him) did the prayers during his lifetime; he did not 
          join prayers together except when he was travelling or at times of hardship.

11669,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11669,Going to visit places and mosques in which the Prophet prayed,"I see some people when they visit Madeenah, going to the seven mosques in addition to al-Masjid al-Nabawi (the Prophet’s Mosque) and Masjid Quba’. In al-Taa’if they make sure that they visit Masjid ‘Addaas, and they want to visit mosques in Makkah in order to pray there. What is the ruling on this?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Travelling to visit al-Masjid al-Nabawi is an action which is prescribed in sharee’ah as indicated by the hadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “No journey should be made to visit mosques except forthree: this mosque of mine [in Madeenah], al-Masjid al-Haram [in Makkah] and al-Masjid al-Aqsa [in al-Quds/Jerusalem]. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim; this version narrated by Muslim). Prayer in (al-Masjid al-Nabawi) is better than a thousand prayers anywhere else, apart from al-Masjid al-Haram. 
Other places which it is prescribed to visit without travelling expressly for that purpose are the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), the graves of his two companions [Abu Bakr and ‘Umar], the graves of the people of al-Baqee’ [the cemetery of Madeenah], the graves of the martyrs of Uhud, and finally, the mosque of Quba’. 
With regard to visiting those graves, this is implied in the general meaning of the hadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “I used to forbid you to visit graves but now visit them.” 
Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah] (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “It is also mustahabb (recommended) to visit the graves of the people of al-Baqee’ and the martyrs of Uhud, to pray for them and ask for forgiveness for them, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to do this, but this is prescribed for all the Muslim graves.” (Majmoo’ al-Fatawa, 17/470) 
The evidence for visiting the Mosque of Quba’ is the hadith narrated in al-Saheehayn from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to come to Quba’ riding and walking.” According to another report: “and he would pray two rak’ahs there.” (narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) also said, “Whoever purifies himself in his house then comes to the mosque of Quba’ and prays there, he will have a reward like that for ‘Umrah.” (Narrated by Ahmad, al-Nasaa’i, Ibn Maajah and al-Haakim. Al-Haakim classed it as saheeh and al-Dhahabi agreed with him. Also classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 6154) 
With regard to visiting other mosques and historical sites and claiming that they are “places which a person should visit”, there is no basis for doing this, and they should not be visited for the following reasons: 
1-There is no shar’i evidence to suggest that these mosques should be singled out for visits, as there is in the case of Masjid Quba’. As is well known, acts of worship should be based on following (the Sunnah), not on innovations.
2-The Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) were the most keen of all people to follow the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). None of them are known to have visited those mosques and historical sites. If this were a good thing they would have been the first ones to do it.
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, ‘Uthmaan, ‘Ali and all the predecessors of the Muhaajiroon and Ansaar used to travel from Madeenah to Makkah to perform Hajj and ‘Umrah, or for other purposes, and none of them said that he was keen to pray in the places where the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had prayed. It is known that if this had been mustahabb in their view, they would have been the first ones to do it, for they had more knowledge of the Sunnah and followed it more closely than anyone else.” (Iqtidaa’ al-Siraat al-Mustaqeem, 2/748).
3-Visits to these places should be disallowed as a preventative measure. This is indicated by the actions of the righteous salaf, above all the rightly-guided khaleefah ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allah be pleased with him). It was narrated that al-Ma’roor ibn Suwayd (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “We went out with ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab and we came across a mosque on our route. The people rushed to pray in that mosque, and ‘Umar said, ‘What is the matter with them?’ They said, ‘This is a mosque in which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed.’ ‘Umar said: ‘O people, those who came before you were destroyed because they followed such (practices) until they made them places of worship. Whoever happens to be there at the time of prayer, let him pray there, and whoever is not there at the time of prayer, let him continue his journey.’” (Narrated by Ibn Waddah in his book al-Bida’ wa’l-Nahiy ‘anhaa; classed as saheeh by Ibn Taymiyah in al-Majmoo’, 1/281).
Shaykh al-Islam (may Allah have mercy on him) said, commenting on this story, “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had not singled out that place for prayer; he prayed there only because he happened to be staying there. Hence ‘Umar thought that imitating him outwardly without having the same reason for doing so did not count as following the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Singling out that place for prayer was like the innovations of the People of the Book which had led to their doom, so he forbade the Muslims to imitate them in this manner. The one who did that was imitating the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in outward appearances, but he was imitating the Jews and Christians in his intention, which is the action of the heart. The action of the heart is what counts, because following in one’s intention is more serious than following in outward appearances.” (Majmoo’ al-Fatawa, 1/281)
In another example, it is narrated that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allah be pleased with him) heard that some people were visiting the tree under which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had accepted the bay’ah of people, so he commanded that it should be cut down.” (Narrated by Ibn Waddaah in his book al-Bida’ wa’l-Nahiy ‘anhaa, and by Ibn Abi Shaybah in al-Musannaf, 2/375. Its isnaad was classed as saheeh by Ibn Hajar in Fath al-Baari, 7/448.Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: the men of its isnaad are thiqaat).
Ibn Waddaah al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Maalik ibn Anas and other scholars of Madeenah regarded it as makrooh to go to those mosques and historical sites connected to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), apart from Quba’ and Uhud.” (al-Bida’ wa’l-Nahiy ‘anhaa, p. 43). What is meant by Uhud is visiting the graves of the martyrs of Uhud.
Shaykh al-Islam (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Hence the scholars of the salaf among the people of Madeenah and elsewhere did not regard it as mustahabb to set out to visit any places in and around Madeenah after the Mosque of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), apart from the mosque of Quba’, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not specify any mosque to be visited apart from that.” (Majmoo’ al-Fatawa, 17/469).
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) said, after mentioning the places which it is prescribed to visit in Madeenah: “With regard to the seven mosques, Masjid al-Qiblatayn (the Mosque of the Two Qiblahs), and other places which some authors who wrote about the rituals of Hajj include among the places to be visited, there is no basis for doing that, and there is no evidence for doing so. What is prescribed for the believer at all times is to follow [the Sunnah], not to innovate.” (Fatawa Islamiyyah, 2/313)
The prominent scholar Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah preserve him) said: “There are no places in Madeenah to be visited apart from these: al-Masjid al-Nabawi, the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), al-Baqee’, the martyrs of Uhud, and the Mosque of Quba’. As for other sites, there is no basis for visiting them.” (Fiqh al-‘Ibaadaat, p. 405)
Some may think that as long as one does not believe that these places hold any special virtue, that justifies visiting them or other historical places. This idea is unacceptable, for the following reasons: 
Firstly: the righteous salaf (may Allah have mercy on them) forbade going to these places in absolute terms, without going into detail.
Secondly: going to these places and singling them out to visit because they are in the vicinity of Madeenah which witnessed the dawn of the Islamic call or because some battles happened there, proves that one believes in their virtue. If one did not hold such a belief, there would be no motive for visiting these places.
Thirdly: if we accept, for the sake of argument, that a person does not believe in their virtue, visiting them is still a means that may lead to that and to doing things that are not prescribed. Taking preventative measures is one of the things prescribed by sharee’ah, as is well known. Al-‘Allaamah Ibn al-Qayyim – may Allah have mercy on him – gave ninety-nine examples illustrating this principle, and after giving the ninety-ninth example he said: “Taking preventative means is one-quarter of responsibility, for there are commands and prohibitions. The commands are of two types, one of which is the end in itself and the other is the means to that end. And prohibitions are of two types, the thing that is prohibited because it is evil in and of itself, and the means that lead to that evil. So preventing the means that lead to that which is Haram is one quarter of the religion.” (I’laam al-Muwaqqi’een, 3/143)
Fourthly: It gives wrong ideas to ignorant people; when they see many people visiting those mosques and historical sites, they will think that this is an action which is prescribed in Islam.
Fifthly: Going to extremes in that matter and calling for visits to historical sites such as Mount Uhud and Jabal al-Noor for leisure purposes is one of the means that lead to shirk. The Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas issued a fatwa (No. 5303) stating that it is not allowed to climb up to the Cave of Hiraa’ for that reason.

Necessity of treating wives equally","Praise be to Allah.How does divorce take place?
So long as the husband has not uttered the word of divorce to her, and the wife has not gone to the judge to seek a divorce, then divorce has not taken place. She is still his wife and divorce does not take place automatically. 
Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked when a woman is considered to be divorced. He said: 
“A woman is considered to be divorced when her husband pronounces the word of divorce to her, when he is of sound mind and under no compulsion to do so, and there is no impediment to divorce such as his being insane or intoxicated, etc., and the woman is pure (not menstruating or bleeding following childbirth) and he has not had intercourse with her since she became pure, or she is pregnant or post-menopausal.” (Fatawa al-Talaq by Shaykh Ibn Baz, 1/35) 
Necessity of treating wives equally
It is haram for this husband to do this and leave his first wife, and not treat her fairly or justly . By doing this he is exposing himself to the stern warning. 
Abu Hurayrah said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever has two wives and inclines more to one of them than the other, will come on the Day of Resurrection with half of his body leaning.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah, 1959; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Sunan Ibn Majah, no. 1603) 
If the first wife is being harmed by this, she has the right to refer the matter to the judge , so that he can force the husband either to divorce her or to annul the marriage. Because the scholars considered not having intercourse with one’s wife with the intention of harming her, even if he has not sworn an oath to that effect, to come under the same ruling as one who takes an oath not to have sexual relations with his wife (cf. al-Baqarah 2:226). 
In this case, if he does not go back to his wife and refuses to divorce her, then the judge may make him divorce or annul the marriage. (See al-Mulakhkhas al-Fiqhi by al-Fawzan, 2/321)

But you have to pay attention to her condition. If the smacking will harm her, then do not smack her. But if the smacking will not harm her because her sickness is minor and there is an urgent need to discipline her so that she will stop doing something that is inappropriate, then it is OK.","Kitaab Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah li al-Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz , vol. 9, p. 342"
11691,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11691,The qiblah of the mosque is different from that indicated by the compass,"I'm a korean muslim who lives in korea. i bought one Qibla compass several months ago,and wanted to check it when i got it. I checked it in our masjid in Seoul, and it didn't indicate proper Qibla direction. I thought this compass was wrong, and told some muslim friends about it as a joke. And they said that they knew that our masjid is located not in the proper direction. after it, i got confused. For example when i do salat in the masjid with others, i stand as they do. but when i do salat by myself, i dont know what i have to do. Do i have to do salat as the compass shows? or as the masjid is located???",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly, we are happy to learn that we have a 
    Muslim brother from Korea who is keen to understand his religion properly and to do acts of worship according to the conditions stipulated in 
    sharee’ah. We ask Allaah to make you steadfast in adhering to His religion and to make you more keen to understand Islam properly. 
With regard to the answer to your question, 
    it varies according to how great the deviation from the qiblah is – assuming that the compass is accurate. If the deviation is great – such as if 
    the qiblah is towards the west, and they are facing south, for example, then this deviation invalidates the prayer and the qiblah of the mosque 
    must be changed to the right direction. 
But if the deviation is slight, and is in the 
    same direction as the qiblah – such as if the qiblah is towards the west, and they deviate slightly towards the north-west or south-west, then 
    this does not matter and you should face this direction with them, because the ruling is that whoever is far away from the Ka’bah should face its 
    general direction and does not have to face it precisely. 
Al-Tirmidhi (344) narrated from Abu Hurayrah 
    that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “What is between the east and the west is qiblah.” (Al-Tirmidhi) said it 
    is hasan saheeh, and it was classed as hasan by al-Albaani in his commentary on Mishkaat al-Masaabeeh (715). See also question no.
    7535. 
You can define the correct direction of the qiblah quite easily by looking at a map and drawing 
    a straight line from your city to Makkah, and defining the direction of the qiblah on that basis. 
And Allaah knows best.",Islam Q&A
11694,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11694,Should a person call upon Allaah even though Allaah knows his needs?,Some people repeat a hadeeth which says: “His knowledge of my condition means that I do not have to ask Him for anything.” They use this as evidence to say that a person does not need to make du’aa’ to Allaah because Allaah knows the person’s needs. How true is this?,,,"Praise be to Allah.This idea is a false idea, because it goes against belief in al-qadar (Divine decree) and negates the idea of taking appropriate means, and suggests giving up an act of worship which is the most noble of worship to Allaah.
 Du’aa’ is very important. It can change the Divine decree and relieve distress. It is beneficial with regard to what has been decreed and what has not been decreed. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Nothing can change the Divine decree except du’aa’. (Narrated by Ahmad, 5/277; Ibn Maajah, 90; al-Tirmidhi, 139. Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 7687. See also al-Saheehah, 145).
 And he said: “Whoever has the gate of du’aa’ opened to him, has the gates of mercy opened to him. Allaah is never asked for anything that He gives which is more beloved to Him than being asked for good health and well-being. Du’aa’ is beneficial with regard to what has been decreed and what has not been decreed. So, O slaves of Allaah, you must make du’aa’.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3548)
 And he said: “No precaution can protect against the decree of Allaah. Du’aa’ is beneficial with regard to what has been decreed and what has not been decreed. The du’aa’ meets the calamity that has been decreed and wrestles with it, until the Day of Resurrection.” (Narrated by al-Tabaraani, 2/800 (33). Al-Albaani said in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 7739, (it is) hasan).
 Some of those who neglect du’aa’, such as some of the Sufis, may use as evidence the hadeeth, “I have no need to ask because He knows my condition”. This hadeeth is false and has no basis. The scholars have spoken out against it and explained why it is false.
 Al-Baghawi mentioned it in his tafseer of Soorat al-Anbiyaa’, pointing out how da’eef (weak) it is. He said: “It was narrated from Ubayy ibn Ka’b that Ibraaheem said, when they tied him up to throw him into the fire, ‘There is no god but You, glory be to You, Lord of the Worlds. To You be praise and to You be the sovereignty. You have no partner or associate.’ Then they threw him with a catapult into the fire, and Jibreel met him and said, ‘O Ibraaheem, do you need something?’ He said, ‘From you, no.’ Jibreel said, ‘Then ask your Lord.’ Ibraaheem said, ‘I have no need to ask because He knows my condition.’”
(Tafseer al-Baghawi Ma’aalim al-Tanzeel, 5/347)
 Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said concerning this hadeeth:
“The hadeeth ‘I have no need to ask because He knows my condition’ is false. It contradicts what Allaah said about Ibraaheem al-Khaleel and other Prophets, that they made du’aa’ to Allaah and asked of Him. And it goes against what Allaah has commanded His slaves to do, asking Him for the best in this world and the next.”
(Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 8/539)
 Shaykh al-Albaani said concerning this hadeeth: “It has no basis. It was narrated by some of them as the words of Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) but it is from the Israa’eeliyaat [stories from Jewish sources]. It has no basis among the marfoo’ reports [those which go back to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)].”
(Silsilat al-Ahaadeeth al-Da’eefah, 1/28 (21))
 Later he said about this hadeeth: “This meaning was adopted by some of those who wrote books of wisdom in the style of the Sufi tareeqahs; they said, your asking from Him – meaning Allaah, may He be exalted – is an accusation against Him.”
(Silsilat al-Ahaadeeth al-Da’eefah, 1/29)
 Then he said, commenting on this idea: “This is serious misguidance. Did the Prophets (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon them) accuse their Lord when they asked Him for various things?”
