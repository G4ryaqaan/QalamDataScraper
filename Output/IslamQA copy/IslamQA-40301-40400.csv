40329,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/40329,Can You Do Ghusl with Braids?,I have a very long hair up to my ankle and every time after sexual intercourse I have to take a full bath. Shall I do that every time for my hair because I find difficulty in doing that specially on alternative days?,"A woman does not have to undo her hair when she does Ghusl following Janabah (impurity following sexual discharge), but she must make sure that the water reaches all parts of her body, including the hair and its roots.",,"Praise be to Allah.A woman does not have to undo her hair when she does Ghusl following Janabah (impurity following sexual discharge), but she must make sure that the water reaches all parts of her body, including the hair and its roots. 
Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: 
Some women braid their hair and when they do Ghusl following janabah they do not undo their braids. Is their Ghusl valid? Please note that the water does not reach all the roots of their hair. Please advise us, may Allah reward you with good. 
He replied: 
“If a woman pours water over her head, that is sufficient, because Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about that. She said: I am a woman with braided hair; should I undo it when doing Ghusl for Janabah ? He said: “No, rather it will be sufficient for you to pour three handfuls of water on your head, then pour water over yourself and you will be purified.” (Narrated by Muslim)
So if a woman pours water on her head three times, that will be sufficient and she does not need to undo the braids, because of this an authentic Hadith.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 10/182) 
Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) also said: 
“With regard to the major purification (i.e., Ghusl), it is essential to pour water over the head three times , and wiping is not sufficient, because of the report narrated by Muslim… then he mentioned the Hadith of Umm Salamah which is quoted above.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 10/161) 
Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Tahdhib As-Sunan: 
“This Hadith of Umm Salamah indicates that women do not have to undo their hair in order to do Ghusl following Janabah. The scholars were agreed on this point, except for the reports narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr and Ibrahim An-Nakha’i who said that she has to undo it, but we do not know of anyone else who agrees with them.”
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“The least that is required is that she should make the water reach every part of her body, even underneath the hair. It is best if it is done in the manner described in the Hadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), when Asma’ bint Shakl asked him about Ghusl following menses. He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “One of you should take her water and lotus leaves and purify herself and purify herself well. Then she should pour water over her head and rub it vigorously, so that it reaches the roots of her hair , and pour water over herself. Then she should take a piece of cloth that is scented with musk and purify herself with it.” Asma’ said: “How should she purify herself with it?” He said: ‘Subhan Allah, let her purify herself with it.” `Aa’ishah said to her: “She should follow the traces of blood.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhaari and Muslim) 
It is not necessary to undo the braids unless they are so tightly done that there is the fear that the water will not reach the roots of the hair, because of the Hadith of Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) which is narrated by Muslim… Then he mentioned the Hadith which we have quoted above.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn `Uthaymin, 11/318, 319)

40336,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/40336,Working for an insurance company,Is life insurance halaal or haram? What is the ruling on those who work in companies offering life insurance?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
Life insurance is a kind of commercial insurance, which is haram, because it involves uncertainty, riba and gambling, and consuming wealth unlawfully. It is not permissible to work in commercial insurance companies, because this is a kind of cooperating in sin, which Allah has forbidden, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Help you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allah. Verily, Allah is Severe in punishment” [al-Maa’idah 5:2]
See also question no. 8889. 
Secondly: 
There is nothing wrong with your keeping the money that you earned from working in that company before you came to know that it is haram, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So whosoever receives an admonition from his Lord and stops eating Ribaa, shall not be punished for the past; his case is for Allah (to judge)” [al-Baqarah 2:275]
With regard to the money that you took from the company after you came to know that it is haram, then you have to get rid of it, because it is haram wealth, so you can spend it on charitable causes.

40354,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/40354,Selling a grant before taking possession of it,"Is it permissible to sell the number of a land grant given by the state? Please note that the land has not been handed over yet, and the person does not know when the handover will be completed; he has only been given a number by the municipality in which it gives the date of application and the number of the application or the grant. He has sold this number to another person and has taken the money on the basis that on the appointed date for the handover he will go back to the municipality and complete the handover procedure, or he will give the buyer authority (power of attorney) to complete the procedures and transfer the land to his name after that.",,,"Praise be to Allah.This 
    transaction is not permissible, because this comes under the heading of 
    gharar (ambiguity, uncertainty), and selling that which one does not have. 
    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Do not 
    sell that which you do not have.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1322; classed as 
    saheeh by al-Albaani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel, 1292. 
Moreover the value of 
    this land may fluctuate with time, so this transaction involves ambiguity 
    and uncertainty. 
And this 
    number is simply a promise which has not yet become the possession of the 
    one who has the paper or number, so how can it be permissible for him to 
    sell it? The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    forbade selling that which a person does not possess. Moreover, he does not 
    know where the land is located. It may be in an area where the price of land 
    is high, or it may be on the edge of town, or outside the town in an 
    undesirable location. And he does not know whether it is in the middle of a 
    residential area or on the edge; on a main street or a back street; whether 
    there is one street, or two or three? All of these factors will affect the 
    value of the land and people’s interest in it. 
Based on 
    this, it is not permissible to sell the paper with the number on it, the 
    details of which he knows nothing about. Rather the owner of the document 
    should wait until he gets the land and the grant is executed in reality, and 
    he gets the deed to the land which proves that he owns it and defines its 
    location and size. Then after that he can sell it if he wants to.

40356,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/40356,He did ‘Umrah during the months of Hajj then went back to his city. Is he doing tamattu’?,"Please advise me about doing ‘Umrah during the months of Hajj with the intention of doing Hajj in the same year. Is it essential when we come back for Hajj that we should do tamattu’, and do we have to offer a sacrifice (hadiy) or not? Please note that we intend to do ifraad Hajj, and we live in Madeenah.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The pilgrim who is doing tamattu’ is the one who enters ihraam for ‘Umrah during 
    the months of Hajj and ends ‘Umrah, then enters ihraam for Hajj in the same year. 
One of the conditions of tamattu’ is that the pilgrim should not leave Makkah 
    after ‘Umrah and go back to his own city. If he goes back to his city then comes back to do Hajj then he is doing ifraad, not tamattu’. He does 
    not have to offer a sacrifice because he set out on a new journey for Hajj. If this pilgrim wants to do tamattu’ then he should enter ihraam from 
    the meeqaat when he comes the second time for Hajj. 
But if he traveled from Makkah after ‘Umrah to a city other than his own, such as 
    if he traveled to Jeddah then came back in ihraam for Hajj, then he is doing tamattu’, and his trip to Jeddah does not invalidate his tamattu’, 
    because he did not go back to his family.
    Shaykh Ibn Baaz was asked about a man who did ‘Umrah in Shawwaal, then went back to his family, then came back to Makkah with the intention of 
    offering Hajj only – is he doing tamattu’ and does he have to offer a sacrifice? 
He replied: 
If a person does ‘Umrah in Shawwaal then goes back to his family, then comes to do 
    Hajj on its own, then the majority of scholars are of the view that he is not doing tamattu’ and he does not have to offer a sacrifice, because he 
    went back to his family then he came back to do Hajj on its own. This is the view that was narrated from ‘Umar and his son (may Allaah be pleased 
    with them both), and it is the view of the majority. It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas that the pilgrim in this case is doing tamattu’, and that he 
    does have to offer a sacrifice, because he combined ‘Umrah and Hajj in the months of Hajj in the same year. But the majority say that if he goes 
    back to his family – and some of them say that if he travels a short distance – then comes back for Hajj on its own, then he is not doing 
    tamattu’. It seems, and Allaah knows best, that the most correct view is that which was narrated from ‘Umar and his son (may Allaah be pleased 
    with them both), which is that if he goes back to his family, then he is not doing tamattu’, and he does not have to offer a sacrifice. But for 
    the one who came to do Hajj and did ‘Umrah and then stayed in Jeddah or al-Ta’if, and he is not one of their people, then he entered ihraam, this 
    person is doing tamattu’, and the fact that he went to al-Ta’if or Jeddah or Madeenah does not mean that he is no longer doing tamattu’, because 
    he came to perform them (‘Umrah and Hajj) together, and he only went to Jeddah or al-Ta’if for a reason. The same applies to one who goes to visit 
    Madeenah – this does not mean that he is no longer doing tamattu’ according to the most obvious and most correct view. So he has to offer the 
    sacrifice of tamattu’ and do saa’i for Hajj just as he did saa’i for ‘Umrah.  
Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 17/96 
In Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz (17/98) it also says: 
If he comes back in ihraam for ‘Umrah – i.e., on his second trip – and exits ihraam then stays 
    until he does Hajj, this is tamattu’. His first ‘Umrah does not mean that he was doing tamattu’, according to the majority, but the second ‘Umrah 
    which he did and then stayed in Makkah until he does Hajj means that he is now doing tamattu’. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: 
If the pilgrim who is doing tamattu’ goes back to his city then sets out again from his city 
    to do Hajj, then he is doing ifraad, because of the interval between ‘Umrah and Hajj that occurred when he went back to his family. His setting 
    out means that he is embarking on a new journey to do Hajj, so in this case his Hajj is ifraad. So he does not have to offer a sacrifice in this 
    case, but if he does this as a trick to try to avoid having to offer a sacrifice, then he is not relieved of that obligation, because trying to 
    use tricks to avoid doing an obligatory duty does not mean that one is relieved thereof, just as trying to use tricks to do something haraam does 
    not make it permissible.

40389,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/40389,Fasting Six Days of Shawwal before Making up Missed Fasts?,"Is it permissible to fast the six days of Shawwal before making up days that I did not fast in Ramadan, if there is not enough time left in the month to do both? May Allah reward you with good.","If you have an excuse that keeps you from fasting the six days of Shawwal in Shawwal because you have to make up missed fasts, then you may fast six days of Shawwal in Dhul-Qa'dah",,"Praise be to Allah.Fasting six days of Shawwal is dependent upon having completed the Ramadan fast, according to the correct view. This is indicated by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Whoever fasts Ramadan then follows it with six days of Shawwal, it will be as if he fasted a lifetime.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1164) 
The conjunction thumma (then) indicates that this must be done in this order. This indicates that the fast of Ramadan must be completed first (by observing the Ramadan fast and making up any missed fasts), then after that one may fast the six days of Shawwal, so as to attain the reward mentioned in the hadith. 
The one who still owes missed Ramadan fasts is said to have fasted part of Ramadan; we cannot say that he has fasted Ramadan. 
But if a person has an excuse that kept him from fasting the six days of Shawwal in Shawwal because he had to make up missed fasts – such as a woman who was bleeding following childbirth and spent all of Shawwal making up for Ramadan – then she may fast six days of Shawwal in Dhul-Qa'dah, because she was excused. 
Similarly for anyone who has an excuse, it is prescribed to make up the six days of Shawwal in Dhul-Qa'dah, after making up the missed Ramadan fasts . But the one who lets the month of Shawwal go by without fasting these days and with no excuse, will not attain this reward. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin was asked: What if a woman owes days from Ramadan – is it permissible for her to give precedence to fasting the six days of Shawwal over making up the days she owes, or should she give priority to the days she owes over fasting the six days of Shawwal? 
He replied:
“If a woman still owes days from Ramadan, then she should not fast the six days of Shawwal until after she has made up what she owes, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever fasts Ramadan then follows it with six days of Shawwal…” Whoever still has days to make up from Ramadan has not fasted Ramadan, so she will not attain the reward of fasting the six days of Shawwal until after she has finished making up the days she owes. If we assume that this making up missed fasts lasts throughout Shawwal, such as if a woman was bleeding following childbirth and did not fast at all in Ramadan, then she started to make up her missed fasts in Shawwal and did not finish that until Dhul-Qa’dah began, then she may fast the six days, and she will have the reward of one who fasted them in Shawwal, because she delayed it for a necessary reason, so she will have the reward.” (Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 20/19) 
In addition to that, it is obligatory to make up missed fasts for the one who had an excuse, indeed that is part of this pillar of Islam. Based on this, hastening to do it and to discharge this duty takes priority over doing actions that are mustahabb .
