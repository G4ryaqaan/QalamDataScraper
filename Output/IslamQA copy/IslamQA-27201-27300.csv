I am an American/Arab who has lived in America all my life but for a few months now was living in arabic country , however things are getting hard for me to continue living here (lack of income, housing etc) and am considering going back to America, also another strong reason is that the Health care system is better and free for my wife who is ill. Please give me as much a detailed answer from the hadith and quran as you can as I don't know for sure if I should strive to continue living here or go back to America regarding Islam.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The basic principle is that it is haraam to settle among the mushrikeen and in their land. If Allaah makes it easy for a person to move from such a country to a Muslim country, then he should not prefer that which is inferior [i.e., living in a non-Muslim country] to that which is better [living in a Muslim country] unless he has an excuse which permits him to go back. 
We advise you, as others have, not to go and live in a kaafir country, unless you are forced to go there temporarily, such as seeking medical treatment that is not readily available in a Muslim country.
Note that whoever gives up a thing for the sake of Allaah, Allaah will compensate him with something better, and that with hardship comes ease, and that whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty), and He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. You should also note that preserving one’s capital is better than taking a risk in the hope of making a profit; the Muslim’s capital is his religion, and he should not risk it for the sake of some transient worldly gain. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) issued a detailed fatwa concerning the issue of settling in a kaafir country, which we will quote here. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: 
Settling in a kaafir country poses a great danger to the Muslim’s religious commitment, morals, behaviour and etiquette. We and others have seen how many of those who settled there went astray and came back different from when they went; they have come back as evildoers, and some have come back having apostatized from their religion and disbelieving in it and in all other religions – we seek refuge with Allaah – denying it completely and mocking the religion and its people, past and present. Hence we must take measures to guard against that and stipulate conditions which will prevent people from following this path which leads to doom and destruction. 
There are two basic conditions which must be met before staying in kaafir countries: 
The first condition is: that the person must be secure in his religious commitment, so that he has enough knowledge, faith and will power to ensure that he will adhere firmly to his religion and beware of deviating or going astray, and that he has an attitude of enmity and hatred of the kaafirs and will not befriend them and love them, for befriending them and loving them are things that contradicts faith. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“You (O Muhammad) will not find any people who believe in Allaah and the Last Day, making friendship with those who oppose Allaah and His Messenger (Muhammad), even though they were their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kindred (people)”
[al-Mujaadilah 58:22]
And He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians as Awliyaa’ (friends, protectors, helpers), they are but Awliyaa’ of each other. And if any amongst you takes them (as Awliyaa’), then surely, he is one of them. Verily, Allaah guides not those people who are the Zaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers and unjust).
And you see those in whose hearts there is a disease (of hypocrisy), they hurry to their friendship, saying: ‘We fear lest some misfortune of a disaster may befall us.’ Perhaps Allaah may bring a victory or a decision according to His Will. Then they will become regretful for what they have been keeping as a secret in themselves”
[al-Maa’idah 5:51, 52]
And it was narrated in al-Saheeh that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever loves a people is one of them” and that “A man will be with the one whom he loves.” 
Loving the enemies of Allaah is one of the most serious dangers for the Muslim, because loving them implies that one agrees with them and follows them, or at the very least that one does not denounce them, hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Whoever loves a people is one of them.” 
The second condition is that he should be able to practise his religion openly, so that he can observe the rituals of Islam with no impediment. So he will not be prevented from establishing regular prayer, and praying Jumu’ah and offering prayers in congregation if there are others there with whom he can pray in congregation and pray Jumu’ah; and he will not be prevented from paying zakaah, fasting, performing Hajj and doing other rituals of Islam. If he will not be able to do that then it is not permissible to stay there because it becomes obligatory to migrate (hijrah) in that case. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said – explaining the categories of people who settle in non-Muslim lands: 
The fourth category includes those who stay for an individual, permissible need, such as doing business or receiving medical treatment. It is permissible for them to stay as long as they need to. The scholars (may Allaah have mercy on them) have stated that it is permissible to go to kaafir countries in order to do business, and they narrated that some of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) had done that. 
The Shaykh said – at the end of the fatwa: 
How can the believer be content to live in the land of the kuffaar where the rituals of kufr are proclaimed openly and rule belongs to someone other than Allaah and His Messenger, seeing that with his own eyes, hearing that with his own ears and approving of it, and even starting to feel that he belongs there and living there with his wife and children, and feeling as comfortable there as he does in the Muslim lands, even though he and his wife and children are in such great danger and their religious commitment and morals are in such peril?

27224,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/27224,Overnight stay of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and Abu Bakr in the cave of Thawr,"I have been trying to find the hadeeth where it says that when the Prophet was migrating to Madeenah and he hid in the cave, an angel or angels covered with their wings the opening of the cave from the view of the searching party of the kuffaar.
The common version that is well known amongst Muslims is that a spider spun a web around the opening thus hiding the Prophet, but I found out that this narration is weak or fabricated, and that the report of angels covering the opening is an authentic version, can you tell me who the narrator was and in which book of hadeeth or seerah I can find this (with chains) ?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The overnight stay of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and Abu Bakr in the cave of Thawr is mentioned in the Book of Allaah and in the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). There follow some details: 
1 – In the Book of Allaah: 
The story of this overnight stay is mentioned in the Qur’aan. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“If you help him (Muhammad) not (it does not matter), for Allaah did indeed help him when the disbelievers drove him out, the second of the two; when they (Muhammad and Abu Bakr) were in the cave, he said to his companion (Abu Bakr): “Be not sad (or afraid), surely, Allaah is with us.” Then Allaah sent down His Sakeenah (calmness, tranquillity, peace) upon him, and strengthened him with forces (angels) which you saw not, and made the word of those who disbelieved the lowermost, while the Word of Allaah that became the uppermost; and Allaah is All-Mighty, All-Wise”
[al-Tawbah 9:40]
This verse clearly states that the mushrikeen were conspiring to kill him, and that they [i.e., the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and Abu Bakr] stayed overnight in the cave. 
2 – The Sunnah 
With regard to the reports in the saheeh Sunnah which speak of the overnight stay in the cave: 
-i- 
It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah, the wife of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), said: “… then the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and Abu Bakr headed towards a cave on the mountain of Thawr, and they hid in it for three nights, during which ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Abi Bakr – who was a smart young lad – stayed with them at night then left just before dawn (at the end of the night) so that he would be among Quraysh in Makkah when morning came, as if he had spent the night among them. He used to listen out to see what they were planning, then he would bring news of that [to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and Abu Bakr] when darkness came…”                                                                
This was narrated by al-Bukhaari (3905) in a lengthy story to which he gave the title “The migration (hijrah) of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his companions to Madeenah.” 
-ii- 
It was narrated that Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: I said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), when I was with him in the cave: “If one of them looks down at his feet he will see us.” He said, “What do you think, O Abu Bakr, of two the third of whom is Allaah?” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3653. 
The story of the spider’s web was narrated by Imam Ahmad (3241) from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him), with regard to the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “And (remember) when the disbelievers plotted against you (O Muhammad) to imprison you” [al-Anfaal 8:30]. He said: Quraysh met together one night in Makkah. Some of them said: When morning comes, imprison him in chains – meaning the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Some said, No, kill him; and others said, No, drive him out. Allaah informed His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) of that, so ‘Ali slept in the bed of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that night, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) went out and hid in the cave. The mushrikoon spent the night lying in wait for ‘Ali, thinking that he was the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). When morning came, they pounced on him, and when they saw ‘Ali, Allaah thwarted their plot. They said, Where is that friend of yours? He said, I do not know. So they set out after him and when they reached the mountain, they were confounded. They climbed up the mountain and passed by the cave, and saw a spider’s web over its entrance. They said, If anyone had entered here, the spider would not have spun a web over the entrance. And he stayed there for three nights. 
The scholars differed concerning this hadeeth. Its isnaad was classed as hasan by al-Haafiz ibn Hajar in Fath al-Baari and by Ibn Katheer in al-Bidaayah wa’l-Nihaayah (3/222). It was classed as da’eef by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah. Ahmad Shaakir said in Tahqeeq al-Musnad (3251): there is some dispute concerning its isnaad. The commentators on al-Musnad said (3251): its isnaad is da’eef. And Allaah knows best. 
With regard to the story of the two doves or pigeons, this was mentioned by Ibn Katheer in al-Bidaayah wa’l-Nihaayah (3/223). He said, it was narrated by Ibn ‘Asaakir, then he said: This hadeeth is ghareeb jiddan with this isnaad. It was similarly classed as da’eef by the commentators on al-Musnad in the same place referred to above. 
Al-Albaani said in al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah (3/339): Note that there is no saheeh hadeeth concerning the spider and doves at the cave, despite the fact that this is widely mentioned in some books and lectures which are given on the anniversary of the migration of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to Madeenah. So this should be borne in mind. 
With regard to the angels concealing the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and Abu Bakr, this was narrated by al-Tabaraani in al-Kabeer (24/106-108) from the hadeeth of Asma’ bint Abi Bakr. It is a lengthy hadeeth in which it says: “Then Abu Bakr said of a man whom he could see opposite the cave, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, he is looking at us.’ He said, ‘No, the angels are concealing us with their wings.’…” 
The isnaad of this hadeeth includes Ya’qoob ibn Humayd ibn Kaasib al-Madani, concerning whom the scholars differed. See Tahdheeb al-Kamaal by al-Mazzi, 32/318-323. 
He was regarded as da’eef (weak) by Ibn Ma’een, Abu Haatim, al-Nasaa’i and Abu Zar’ah al-Raazi. 
Abu Dawood al-Sijistaani said: we have seen in his Musnad ahaadeeth which we regard as munkar. We asked him for their sources and he refused to tell us, then he narrated them after that. We found ahaadeeth in some books that had been recently altered, and these ahaadeeth are mursal but he added isnaads to them and added something to the texts. 
Ibn ‘Adiyy said: There is nothing wrong with him and his reports. He narrated many ahaadeeth and many ghareeb reports. 
Al-Dhahabi said: He was one of the scholars of hadeeth but he reports munkar and ghareeb reports. 
Ibn Hibbaan classed him as thiqah (trustworthy). Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said, he is sadooq (truthful) but he is confused sometimes. 
Al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) classed his hadeeth as hasan but he did not class this hadeeth as hasan. 
He said in al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah (3/263):
What is established concerning this Ya’qoob is that his hadeeth is hasan… If there is no other fault in the isnaad then it is hasan… Then he said: Shaykh al-Tabaraani Ahmad ibn ‘Amr al-Khallaal al-Makki did not find anything about his background. He narrated approximately 16 hadeeth from him in al-Mu’jam al-Awsat, which indicates that he was one of his well-known shaykhs. If the hadeeth is known or there are corroborating reports, then the hadeeth is hasan.

27227,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/27227,He drank after the adhaan thinking that dawn had not yet come,"I was sleeping and I did not hear the adhaan of Fajr, and the alarm clock was running slow. After I had drunk a cup of water the iqaamah for prayer was given. What should I do? Please advise me, may Allah reward you.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The correct scholarly view is that whoever eats thinking that Fajr (dawn) has not yet come, then finds out that it had in fact come, does not have to do anything, because he was unaware of the time, so he is excused. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If a fasting person eats or drinks anything that breaks the fast out of ignorance, then his fast is still valid, whether he was unaware of the time, or unaware of the ruling, such as a man who gets up at the end of the night, and thinks that dawn has not yet come, so he eats and drinks, then he finds out that dawn had in fact come – his fast is still valid because he was unaware of the time. An example of one who is not aware of the ruling is a fasting person who has cupping done and does not know that cupping invalidates the fast, so we say to him: your fast is still valid. The evidence for that is the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error, our Lord! Lay not on us a burden like that which You did lay on those before us (Jews and Christians); our Lord! Put not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear. Pardon us and grant us forgiveness. Have mercy on us. You are our Mawlaa (Patron, Supporter and Protector) and give us victory over the disbelieving people” [al-Baqarah 2:286]
That is the evidence from the Qur’aan. The evidence from the Sunnah is the hadeeth of Asma’ bint Abi Bakr (may Allah be pleased with her) which was narrated by al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh. She said: “We broke our fast on a cloudy day at the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), then the sun came out.” That meant that they had broken their fast during the day, but they did not realize, because they thought that the sun had set. But the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not tell them to make up that day; if it had been obligatory to make it up he would have told them to do so. And if he had told them to do that it would have been transmitted to us.

27232,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/27232,Signs of Allah’s Love for His Slave,What are the signs of Allaah’s love for His slave?,,,"Praise be to Allah.You have asked about a serious and weighty matter, which none attain but very few of the righteous slaves of Allaah. 
The love of Allaah is ""the status for which the righteous compete and strive… It is the nourishment of hearts and souls… the delight of the eyes… It is the life of which one who is denied it is dead… the light which the one who loses it is in deep darkness… the healing of which the one who is denied is sick… the joy which the one who is deprived of it lives in distress and pain…  
It is the spirit of faith and good deeds… by means of which one may draw closer to Allaah… which, when it is absent, one is like a body in which there is no soul."" 
O Allaah, make us among those whom You love. 
The love of Allaah has signs and causes which are like the key to the door. These causes include the following: 
1 –Following the guidance of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Allaah says in His Holy Book (interpretation of the meaning): 
""Say (O Muhammad to mankind): If you (really) love Allaah, then follow me (i.e. accept Islamic Monotheism, follow the Qur’aan and the Sunnah/prophetic teachings), Allaah will love you and forgive you your sins. And Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful""
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:31] 
2-5 – Being humble towards the believers and stern towards the kaafirsdisbelievers, waging jihad (a battle/struggle) for the sake of Allaah, and not fearing anyone or anything but Him. Allaah has mentioned these qualities in a single verse, in which He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
""O you who believe! Whoever from among you turns back from his religion (Islam), Allaah will bring a people whom He will love and they will love Him; humble towards the believers, stern towards the disbelievers, fighting/striving in the way of Allaah, and never fear of the blame of the blamers"" [al-Maa'idah 5:54] 
In this verse Allaah describes the attributes of those whom He loves, the first of which is: humility and not being arrogant towards the Muslims, and being stern towards the kaafirsdisbelievers, and not humbling or humiliating oneself before them. They (the ones whom Allaah loves) strive for the sake of Allaah, against the Shaytaan, the kuffaardisbelievers, the hypocrites and the evildoers, and they strive against their own selves (jihad al-nafs). They do not fear the blame of any blamer, because so long as they are following the commands of their religion, he will not care about anyone who mocks him or blames him. 
6 – Doing naafil (supererogatory) acts of worship.  Allaah says – according to a hadeeth qudsi (divinely inspired saying of the Prophet) – ""My slave keeps drawing near to me by means of supererogatory acts of worship until I love Him."" Supererogatory acts of worship include naafil prayers, charity, ‘Umrah, Hajj (minor and major pilgrimage to Makkah) and fasting. 
8-12 – Loving, visiting one another, helping one another (financially) and offering sincere advice to one another for the sake of Allaah. 
These attributes were mentioned in a single hadeeth (narration) in which the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) narrated that his Lord said: ""My love is guaranteed for two who love one another for My sake; My love is guaranteed for two who visit one another for My sake; My love is guaranteed for two who help one another (financially) for My sake; My love is guaranteed to for two who uphold ties with one another for My sake."" 
Narrated by Ahmad, and 4/236 and 5/236; al-Tanaasuh by Ibn Hibbaan, 3/338; the two ahaadeeth were classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Targheeb wa’l-Tarheeb, 3019, 3020, 3021. 
What is meant by ""two who visit one another for My sake"" is that they only visit one another for the sake of Allaah, seeking thereby His pleasure for their loving one another for His sake or cooperating in worshipping Him. 
From al-Muntaqa Sharh al-Muwatta’, hadeeth 1779. 
13 – Being tested. Calamities and disasters are a test for a person, and this is a sign that Allaah loves him, because this is like medicine: even though it is bitter, but still you offer the medicine, despite its bitterness, to the one whom you love; and Allaah’s is the highest description. According to a saheeh hadeeth (authentic narration): ""The greatest reward comes from the greatest trial. When Allaah loves people, He tests them, and whoever accepts it gains the pleasure of Allaah and whoever complains earns His wrath. 
Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2396;and Ibn Maajah, 4031; classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani. 
For calamities to befall the believer is better than punishments being stored up for him in the Hereafter. How can it be otherwise when he is raised in status and his bad deeds are erased thereby? The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""When Allaah wills good for His slave, He hastens his punishment in this world, and when He wills bad for His slave, He withholds his sins until he comes with them on the Day of Resurrection.""  
Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2396; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani. 
The scholars have explained that the one from whom calamities and trials are withheld is the hypocrite, for Allaah withholds [his punishment] in this world, so as to bring him with all his sins on the Day of Resurrection. 
O Allaah, make us among those whom You love. 
If Allaah loves you, do not ask about the good that you will attain and the virtue that you will acquire… it is sufficient for you to know that you are the beloved of Allaah. The great fruits of the love of Allaah for His slave are as follows: 
1 – People will love him and he will be accepted on earth, as it says in the hadeeth narrated by al-Bukhaari (3209): ""When Allaah loves a slave, He says to Jibreel, 'I love so-and-so, so love him,' so Jibreel loves him and then calls out to the people of heaven, 'Allaah loves so-and-so, so love him,' and the people of heaven love him, and then acceptance is placed in the Earth for him."" 
2 – What Allaah has mentioned in the hadeeth qudsi of the great virtues of those whom He loves. It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""Whosoever shows enmity to someone devoted to Me, I shall be at war with him. My servant draws not near to Me with anything more loved by Me than the religious duties I have enjoined upon him, and My servant continues to draw near to Me with supererogatory works so that I shall love him. When I love him I am his hearing with which he hears, his seeing with which he sees, his hand with which he strikes and his foot with which he walks. Were he to ask [something] of Me, I would surely give it to him, and were he to ask Me for refuge, I would surely grant him it. I do not hesitate about anything as much as I hesitate about [seizing] the soul of My faithful servant: he hates death and I hate hurting him."" Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6502. 
This hadeeth qudsi includes a number of benefits of Allaah’s love for His slave: 
(i)                ""I am his hearing with which he hears"" i.e., he does not listen to anything but that which Allaah loves.
(ii)              ""his seeing with which he sees"" i.e., he does not see anything but that which Allaah loves.
(iii)            ""his hand with which he strikes"" i.e., he does not do anything with his hand but that which Allaah loves.
(iv)            ""and his foot with which he walks"" i.e., he does not go towards anything but that which Allaah loves.
(v)              ""Were he to ask [something] of Me, I would surely give it to him"" i.e., his du’aa’s (supplications) are heard and his requests are granted.
(vi)            ""and were he to ask Me for refuge, I would surely grant him it"" i.e., he is protected by Allaah from all things…

I want to know if this is a known supplication and what are the virtues of reciting it.",,,"Praise be to Allah.This du`a is not known in the books of Sunnah. It seems most likely that it has been fabricated by some of the Sufis in what they call al-awraad, which is a collection of du`as and words that are compiled for the mureeds (followers of a Sufi shaykh) to recite at certain times in a certain manner and for a certain number of times. Undoubtedly it is not permissible to follow them in the awraad that they fabricate. “Du`a is an act of worship,” as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, and the basic principle concerning acts of worship is tawqeef i.e., stopping at what has been narrated in sharee’ah (and not inventing anything new).  
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
Undoubtedly dhikr and du`as are among the best kinds of worship. Acts of worship are based on tawqeef and following, not on whims and desires and innovation. The du`as and dhikrs narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) are the best that anyone can find of dhikr and du`a, and the one who limits himself to them will be safe and sound. The beneficial results that they bring cannot be put into words or fully comprehended by man. Any other dhikrs may be haraam or they may be makrooh. They may involve shirk which most people may not realize and which would take too long to explain in detail. 
No one has the right to prescribe for people any kind of dhikr or du`a that is not narrated in the Sunnah and make it an act of worship that people should perform regularly as they perform the five daily prayers regularly. Rather this is a kind of innovation in religion for which Allah has not given permission… As for adopting a wird that is not prescribed in sharee’ah and dhikr that is not prescribed in sharee’ah, this is something that is forbidden. Moreover the du`as and adhkar that are prescribed in sharee’ah are are the best and lead to achieving all aims and goals; no one turns away from them and adopts innovated and invented adhkar except one who is ignorant, negligent or a wrong doer.

27259,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/27259,What Constitutes Zina?,"What is the ruling on one who is intimate with women but does not commit zina, i.e. kissing etc?","Zina does not refer only to penetration, rather there is 1- the zina of the hand, 2- the zina of the eyes, and 3- the zina of the tongue, even though zina that is committed with the private parts, is the zina which is punishable with the hadd  in Islam.","Types of zina


The prohibition of approaching zina


Ta'zir punishment for things that lead to zina


How to seek repentance from things that lead to zina","Praise be to Allah.Types of zina
Zina (adultery, fornication) does not refer only to penetration, rather there is the zina of the hand, which is touching that which is forbidden, and the zina of the eyes, which is looking at that which is forbidden, even though zina that is committed with the private parts, is the zina which is punishable with the prescribed punishment. 
Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has decreed for every son of Adam his share of zina, which he will inevitably commit. The zina of the eyes is looking, the zina of the tongue is speaking, one may wish and desire, and the private parts confirm that or deny it.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5889; Muslim, 2657) 
The prohibition of approaching zina
It is not permissible for the Muslim to long for the things that lead to zina , such as kissing, being alone, touching and looking, for all these things are haram and lead to the greater evil which is zina. 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And come not near to unlawful sex. Verily, it is a Fahishah (i.e. anything that transgresses its limits: a great sin, and an evil way that leads one to Hell unless Allah Forgives him)” [al-Isra 17:32]
Looking at that which is forbidden is one of the arrows of the Shaytan , which leads a person to doom, even if he did not do it intentionally at first. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts). That is purer for them. Verily, Allah is All-Aware of what they do. And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts).” [al-Nur 24:30-31]
Think about how Allah connects the issue of lowering the gaze with the issue of protecting the private parts (guarding one’s chastity) in these verses, and how lowering the gaze is mentioned first, before protecting the private parts, because the eye influences the heart. 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“In these two verses, Allah commands the believing men and women to lower their gaze and guard their chastity, which is because of the serious nature of zina and what it leads to of great corruption among the Muslims. Letting one's gaze wander freely is one of the causes of sickness in the heart and the occurrence of immoral actions, whereas lowering the gaze is one of the means of keeping oneself safe from that. Hence Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts). That is purer for them. Verily, Allah is All-Aware of what they do.” [al-Nur 24:30]
Lowering one’s gaze and guarding one’s chastity is purer for the believer in this world and in the Hereafter, whereas letting one’s gaze wander freely and not guarding one's chastity are among the greatest causes of doom and punishment in this world and in the Hereafter. We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound. 
Allah tells us that He is All-Aware of what people do, and that nothing is hidden from Him. This is a warning to the believer against doing that which Allah has forbidden and turning away from that which Allah has prescribed for him, and it is a reminder to him that Allah sees him and knows all that he does, whether it is good or otherwise. As Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allah knows the fraud of the eyes, and all that the breasts conceal.” [Ghafir 40:19]” (Al-Tabarruj wa Khataruhu) 
The Muslim has to fear his Lord in secret and in public, and keep away from that which Allah has forbidden of being alone with a member of the opposite sex, looking, shaking hands, kissing and other haram actions which lead to the immoral action of zina. 
Ta'zir punishment for things that lead to zina
The sinner should not be deceived into thinking that he will not commit zina and that he will stop at these haram actions and not go that far, for the Shaytan will never leave him alone. There is no prescribed punishment (hadd) for these haram actions, such as kissing etc., because the prescribed punishment is only for intercourse (zina), but the judge may punish him with a ta'zir punishment to deter him and others like him from committing these sins. 
Ibn al-Qayyim said:  
“Ta’zir punishments may be prescribed for every sin for which there is no prescribed punishment or specific expiation (kaffarah), for sins are of three kinds: those for which there is a prescribed punishment but no kaffarah is required; those for which kaffarah is required but there is no prescribed punishment; and those for which there is neither a prescribed punishment nor kaffarah. The first type includes such crimes as stealing, drinking alcohol, zina and slander. The second includes having intercourse during the day in Ramadan, or when in ihram. The third type includes having intercourse with a slave woman who is owned jointly with someone else, kissing a non-mahram woman and being alone with her, entering the public baths without a waist wrapper, eating dead meat, blood and pork, and so on.” (I’lam al-Muwaqqa’in, 2/77) 
How to seek repentance from things that lead to zina
The person who has committed any of these actions has to repent to Allah , for whoever repents Allah will accept his repentance , and the one who repents is like one who did not sin. 
One of the greatest means of expiation for such sins is offering the five daily prayers regularly and on time. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The five daily prayers, and from one Jumu`ah to the next, and from one Ramadan to the next, expiates for the sins that come in between, so long as you avoid major sins.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1/209)

27261,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/27261,Permissibility of Ambiguity and Definition of Necessity,"When is deliberate ambiguity valid? If that is in cases of necessity only, then what is the definition of necessity in this case?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The Arabic word tawriyah [translated here 
    as deliberate ambiguity] means to conceal something.

    Allah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “Then Allah sent a crow who scratched the 
    ground to show him how to hide [yuwaari] the dead body of his brother. He 
    (the murderer) said: “Woe to me! Am I not even able to be as this crow and 
    to hide the dead body of my brother?” Then he became one of those who 
    regretted” [5:31] 

    “O Children of Adam! We have bestowed 
    raiment upon you to cover yourselves (screen your private parts – yuwaari 
    saw’aatikum) and as an adornment; and the raiment of righteousness, that is 
    better. Such are among the Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, 
    revelations, etc.) of Allaah, that they may remember (i.e. leave falsehood 
    and follow truth)”

    [al-A’raaf 7:26] 
With 
    regard to the meaning in sharee’ah (religious) terminology, it refers to 
    someone who says something that may appear to have one meaning to the 
    listener but the speaker intends something different that may be understood 
    from these words. For example, he says, “I do not have a dirham in my 
    pocket,” and that is understood to mean that he does not have any money at 
    all, when what he means is that he does not have a dirham but he may have a 
    dinar, for example. This is called ambiguity or dissembling. 

    Deliberate ambiguity is regarded as a 
    legitimate solution for avoiding difficult situations that a person may find 
    himself in when someone asks him about something, and he does not want to 
    tell the truth on the one hand, and does not want to lie, on the other. 

    Deliberate ambiguity is permissible if it 
    is necessary or if it serves a shar’i (religious) interest, but it is not 
    appropriate to do it a great deal so that it becomes a habit, or to use it 
    to gain something wrongfully or to deprive someone of his rights.  

    Al-Nawawi said: 
The 
    scholars said: If that is needed to serve some legitimate shar’i interest 
    that outweighs the concern about misleading the person to whom you are 
    speaking, or it is needed for a reason that cannot be achieved without 
    lying, then there is nothing wrong with using deliberate ambiguity as an 
    acceptable alternative. But if there is no interest to be served and no 
    pressing need, then it is makrooh (disliked), but is not haram 
    (impermissible). If it is a means of taking something wrongfully or 
    depriving someone of their rights, then it is haram in that case. This is 
    the guideline in this matter. Al-Adhkaar. 

    Some scholars were of the view that it is 
    haram to resort to deliberate ambiguity if there is no reason or need to do 
    so. This was the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah 
    have mercy on him). See al-Ikhtiyaaraat. 

    There are situations in which the Prophet 
    (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught that we may use deliberate 
    ambiguity, for example: 

    If a man loses his wudoo (ablution) whilst 
    praying in congregation, what should he do in this embarrassing situation? 

    The answer is that he should place his 
    hand over his nose and leave. 

    The evidence for that is the report 
    narrated from ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: The 
    Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If 
    anyone of you breaks his wudoo whilst praying, let him hold his nose and 
    leave.” Sunan Abi Dawood. 
Al-Teebi 
    said: The command to hold his nose is so that it will look as if he has a 
    nosebleed. This is not a lie, rather it is a kind of ambiguity. This 
    concession is granted so that the Shaytan will not trick him into staying 
    put because of feeling embarrassed in front of people. 
Mirqaah 
    al-Mafaateeh Sharh Mishkaat al-Masaabeeh.  

    This is a kind of ambiguity that is 
    permitted, so as to avoid any embarrassment and so that whoever sees him 
    leaving will think that he has a nosebleed.

    Similarly If a Muslim faces a difficult 
    situation where he needs to say what is against the truth in order to 
    protect himself or someone who is innocent, or to save himself from serious 
    trouble, is there a way for him to escape the situation without lying or 
    falling into sin?

    Yes, there is a legal way and a 
    permissible escape that one can make use of if necessary. It is equivocation 
    or indirectness in speech. Imam al-Bukhaari (may Allah have mercy on him) 
    entitled a chapter of his Saheeh: “Indirect speech is a safe way to avoid a 
    lie”. (Saheeh al-Bukhari, Kitaab al-Adab (Book of Manners)).

    Equivocation means saying something which 
    has a closer meaning that the hearer will understand, but it also has a 
    remote meaning which what is actually meant and is linguistically correct. 
    The condition for this is that whatever is said should not present a truth 
    as falsity and vice versa. The following are examples of such statements 
    used by the salaf (pious predecessors) and early imams (religious leaders), 
    and collected by Imam Ibn al-Qayyim in his book Ighaathat al-Lahfaan:

    It was reported about Hammad (may Allah 
    have mercy on him), if someone came that he did not want to sit with, he 
    would say as if in pain: “My tooth, my tooth!” Then the boring person whom 
    he did not like would leave him alone.

    Imam Sufyan Al-Thawri was brought to the 
    khaleefah al-Mahdi, who liked him, but when he wanted to leave, the 
    khaleefah told him he had to stay. Al-Thawri swore that he would come back. 
    He then went out, leaving his shoes at the door. After some time he came 
    back, took his shoes and went away. The khaleefah asked about him, and was 
    told that he had sworn to come back, so he had come back and taken his 
    shoes.

    Imam Ahmad was in his house, and some of 
    his students, including al-Mirwadhi, were with him. Someone came along, 
    asking for al-Mirwadhi from outside the house, but Imam Ahmad did not want 
    him to go out, so he said: “Al-Mirwadhi is not here, what would he be doing 
    here?” whilst putting his finger in the palm of his other hand, and the 
    person outside could not see what he was doing.

    Other examples of equivocation or 
    indirectness in speech include the following:

    If someone asks you whether you have seen 
    so-and-so, and you are afraid that if you tell the questioner about him this 
    would lead to harm, you can say “ma ra aytuhu”, meaning that you have not 
    cut his lung, because this is a correct meaning in Arabic [“ma ra aytuhu” 
    usually means “I have not seen him,” but can also mean “I have not cut his 
    lung”]; or you could deny having seen him, referring in your heart to a 
    specific time and place where you have not seen him. If someone asks you to 
    swear an oath that you will never speak to so-and-so, you could say, 
    “Wallaahi lan ukallumahu”, meaning that you will not wound him, because 
    “kalam” can also mean “wound” in Arabic [as well as “speech”]. Similarly, if 
    a person is forced to utter words of kufr (disbelief) and is told to deny 
    Allah, it is permissible for him to say “Kafartu bi’l-laahi”, meaning “I 
    denounce the playboy” [which sounds the same as the phrase meaning “I deny 
    Allah.”]

    (Ighaathat al-Lahfaan by Ibn al-Qayyim. 
    See also the section on equivocation (ma’aareed) in Al-Adaab al-Shar’iyyah 
    by Ibn Muflih).

    However, one should be cautious that the 
    use of such statements is restricted only to situations of great difficulty, 
    otherwise:

    Excessive use of it may lead to lying.

    One may lose good friends, because they 
    would always be in doubt as to what is meant.

    If the person to whom such a statement is 
    given comes to know that the reality was different from what he was told, 
    and he was not aware that the person was engaging in deliberate ambiguity or 
    equivocation, he would consider that person to be a liar. This goes against 
    the principle of protecting one’s honour by not giving people cause to doubt 
    one’s integrity.

    The person who uses such a technique 
    frequently may become proud of his ability to take advantage of people.

Please do advise.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Allaah has obliged sons to honour their 
    parents and He has forbidden them to disobey them. We have discussed some of their (parents’) rights in the answer to question no.
    5053. 
What you have said about your brother’s 
    treatment of your parents is an evil action and is a major sin. You have to advise him and remind him of what Allaah has enjoined upon him towards 
    his parents and relatives. 
It is not permissible for you to accuse 
    others of practicing witchcraft against your brother. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) warned us against suspicion, 
    and told us that it is the falsest of speech. It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said: “Beware of suspicion, because suspicion is the falsest of speech; do not spy on one another, do not pry into others’ affairs, do not hate 
    one another; be brothers.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4849; Muslim, 2563. 
So you have to look for the reasons why your 
    brother is doing this to you. There may be causes that you can put a stop to and help him to overcome. 
If there is no apparent reason, there is 
    nothing wrong with asking someone whose religious commitment and knowledge you trust to recite ruqyah for him and find out what is going on. If he 
    finds out that he has been bewitched, then you have to treat him with remedies that will remove that sihr (magic), remedies that are proven in the 
    Qur’aan and Sunnah. 
Whatever the case, such a situation requires 
    deliberation and wisdom in your dealing with him. Whether he is disobeying his Lord by treating his parents badly or he has been bewitched, he is 
    sick, and the sick person needs to be treated kindly in order to find the most suitable remedy for his condition.

[al-Hashr 59:10]
According to a hadeeth narrated by Anas ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him), the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Do not hate one another, do not envy one another, do not turn your backs on one another, and be, O slaves of Allaah, brothers. It is not permissible for a Muslim to forsake his brother for more than three days.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5718; Muslim, 2559. 
Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said: His saying “Do not hate one another” is a prohibition which is aimed at encouraging them to discipline themselves to love one another. Al-Istidhkaar, 8/289. 
But a person may feel that he does not like a person enough for him to become a close friend, even though he fulfils his Islamic duty of returning his salaams, saying “Yarhamuk-Allaah (May Allaah have mercy on you)” if he sneezes, helping him if he needs help, and so on. In this case what exists between them does not come under the heading of forsaking or shunning, and it is forgiven in sha Allaah. According to a hadeeth narrated by ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her), the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Souls are troops collected together and those who got along with one other (in the realm where souls existed before entering physical bodies in this world) will have an affinity with one another (in this world) andthose amongst who did not get along with one another  (in the realm where souls existed before entering physical bodies in this world) will also not get along (in this world).” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3158; Muslim, 2638. 
Al-Khattaabi said: This may be understood as referring to similarlity between souls which are either good or bad, righteous or immoral, and that good people are attracted to those who are like them and evil people are likewise attracted to those who are like them, so people’s souls recognize one another according to their nature, whether good or evil; if they are similar they will get along and if they are different they will not get along. 
Al-Qurtubi said: Although souls have in common the fact that they are all souls, they differ in other ways. Souls of similar nature will get along because of their nature. Therefore we see people of a certain type get along, but they do not get along with people of a different nature, and we see that with people who are of a similar nature, some of them get along with one another and some do not, and that depends on the issues which form the basis of getting along or otherwise.",Islam Q&A
27280,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/27280,Each of them breastfed the child of the other; do any rulings result from that?,"I hope that you can explain the ruling on breastfeeding (radaa’ah) in full, for example, I breastfed my brother-in-law’s son for a month, and my son was breastfed by my brother-in-law’s wife. I have a daughter and a son who are older than the child who was breastfed by my brother-in-law’s wife, and she also had two children before the child of hers whom I breastfed. 
I hope that you can describe the kind of breastfeeding that makes the child a mahram and the rulings that apply to the rest of the siblings? Thank you very much.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Whoever is breastfed by a woman five times, before the age of two years, becomes her child through breastfeeding and she becomes his mother. Her husband (the “owner of the milk”) becomes a father to him through breastfeeding, and everyone who was also breastfed by this woman becomes his brother or sister through breastfeeding, and so on. 
That is because of the report narrated by Muslim (1425) from ‘Aa’ishah who said: “When the Quran was first revealed, the number of breast-feedings that would make a child a relative (mahram) was ten, then this was abrogated and replaced with the number of five which is well-known.” 
And al-Tirmidhi narrated that Umm Salamah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The only breastfeeding that creates the relationship of mahram is that which fills the stomach from the breast, before weaning.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Irwa’, 2150. 
What is meant by “from the breast” means at the time of breastfeeding. The Arabs say “Maata fulaan fi’l-thadiy (So and so died at the time of breastfeeding, i.e, in infancy, before weaning).” This is the view of al-Shawkaani. 
Al-Tirmidhi said: This is a saheeh hasan hadeeth, and the view followed by the majority of scholars among the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and others is that breastfeeding does not make a child a mahram unless it is done before the child reaches the age of two. Any breastfeeding that occurs after the age of two does not make the child a mahram.” 
Al-Bukhaari (2645) narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said concerning the daughter of Hamzah: “She is not permissible for me (to marry), because what becomes mahram (forbidden for marriage) through breastfeeding is that which become mahram through blood ties. And she is the daughter of my brother through breastfeeding” 
The definition of breastfeeding: 
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
One breastfeeding (rad’ah) means when the child takes the breast and starts suckling, and then lets it go without being made to do so. That is one breastfeeding, because the Lawgiver referred to one breastfeeding in general terms, so it is to be interpreted according to custom, and this is the custom. If the child stops briefly in order to breathe or to rest or because of some distraction, then quickly goes back to the breast, this is regarded as one breastfeeding, just as when a person who is eating pauses briefly then quickly goes back to eating, this is not regarded as two meals, rather it is one. This is the view of al-Shaafa’i.  And if the infant moves from one breast to the other, this is one breastfeeding. See also question no. 2864 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
If a woman breastfeeds a child for five well known breastfeedings or more during the first two years, the infant becomes a child for her and her husband who is the owner of the milk, and all that woman’s children from the husband who is the owner of the milk or from other husbands become siblings of this infant, and the children of the man who is the owner of the milk, whether from the breastfeeding woman or from other wives, become siblings of the infant. Her brothers become maternal aunts for him, and the brothers of the husband, the owner of the milk, become paternal uncles for him, and the father of the woman becomes a grandfather for the child and the father of the husband, the owner of the milk, becomes a grandfather to him and the husband’s mother becomes a grandmother to him, because Allah says concerning female mahrams in Soorat al-Nisa’ (interpretation of the meaning): 
“your foster mothers who gave you suck, your foster milk suckling sisters”
[al-Nisa’ 4:23]
 And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “What becomes mahram (forbidden for marriage) through breastfeeding is that which become mahram through blood ties.” And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no breastfeeding except during the first two years.” And it was proven in Saheeh Muslim that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “When the Qur’an was first revealed, the number of breast-feedings that would make a child a relative (mahram) was ten, then this was abrogated and replaced with the number of five which is well-known. Then the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) passed away when that was the state of affairs.” This version was narrated by al-Tirmidhi but it is also found in Saheeh Muslim. 
From Fataawa Islamiyyah, 3/333 
In conclusion: 
If your son was breastfed five times in the first two years by your brother-in-law’s wife, then he is a brother to all of her sons and daughters. 
Similarly the son of this woman who was breastfed by you, becomes a son to you and a brother to all your sons and daughters, whether they are older or younger than the one who was breastfed, whether they were already present or have not been born yet. 
Your sons – apart from the son who was breastfed by the wife of his paternal uncle – may marry the daughters of their paternal uncle, because they are not mahrams to one another. And your daughters may marry the sons of their paternal uncle except the son who was breastfed by you, because he is a brother to them, as explained above.
