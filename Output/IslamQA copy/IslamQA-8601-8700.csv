8603,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/8603,Praying While Resisting The Urge To Defecate,"Sometimes I need to defecate before I pray, but I pray then I do not feel that urge whilst I am praying. Is my prayer acceptable? And sometimes the opposite happens – is my prayer acceptable in that case?",It is not permissible for a person to start praying when he is resisting the urge to urinate or defecate because Prophet Muhammad said: “You should not pray when food is ready or when resisting the urge to urinate or defecate.”,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for a person to start praying when he is resisting the urge to urinate or defecate because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “You should not pray when food is ready or when resisting the urge to urinate or defecate.” (Narrated by Muslim) 
The reason for that – and Allah knows best – is that this prevents a person from having the necessary presence of mind and humility in the prayer. 
However, if a person prays in this state, his prayer is valid although it is somewhat lacking and is imperfect because of the Hadith quoted; he does not have to repeat it.  But if one starts to pray when he is not resisting the urge to urinate or defecate , then he starts to feel that need during the prayer, then the prayer is valid and there is nothing disliked in it, so long as that need does not prevent one from completing the prayer.

8621,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/8621,Is it permissible to say “circumstances willed” or “circumstances dictated”?,"I read in some stories, literary works and journalistic articles the phrase  “circumstances willed” or “circumstances dictated”, or “fate decreed”. What is the ruling on these phrases?",,,"Praise be to Allah.These are inappropriate phrases, because 
          circumstances and fate do not have a will.
The great scholar Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen 
          (may Allaah preserve him) was asked about these phrases, and said:
“ ‘Fate willed’ or ‘circumstances willed/dictated’ 
          are reprehensible phrases, because the Arabic word for circumstances, 
          zuroof, is the plural 
          of zarf, which is another 
          word for time – and time does not have a will. Similarly, fate does 
          not have a will either.
The One Who does have a will is Allaah. If a person 
          says ‘the decree of Allaah dictated such and such’, there is nothing 
          wrong with that. But it is not correct to attribute will to decrees, 
          because the will does not belong to the description, it belongs to the 
          One Who is described.” Majmoo’ Fataawa

Though I strongly believe that death may come any moment.,,,"Praise be to Allah.There is nothing to prevent a person from 
          making plans and estimating what he will need in the future, and thinking 
          of what he hopes to achieve, or saying, ‘I will do such-and-such tomorrow,’ 
          or next week, or next year.’ But when he does that he has to say ‘in 
          sha Allaah (if Allaah wills).’ Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
          
“And never say 
          of anything, ‘I shall do such and such thing tomorrow,’ except (with 
          the saying): ‘If Allaah will.’…” 
[al-Kahf 18:23] 
          
 Everything that a person intends to 
          do in the future, or resolves to do, or hopes to achieve, is based on 
          hope, and hope is what motivates people to do things.  But the 
          believer strives in this world for the sake of that which will benefit 
          him in both his religion and his worldly affairs. So he takes the means 
          and puts his trust in Allaah, and seeks His help, as the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
“Strive to do that which will benefit 
          you, and seek the help of Allaah.” 
And Allaah says (interpretation of the 
          meaning): 
“… So worship 
          Him and put your trust in Him…” 
[Hood  11:123] 
 The kaafir and the 
          negligent person, on the other hand, depend on the means and forget 
          their Lord in Whose Hand is Sovereignty and nothing happens except what 
          He wills. If a man looks at the obstacles which stand between him and 
          what he hopes for, and he thinks too much about death and other obstacles, 
          he will stop making efforts and neglect his own interests. Thus it is 
          apparent that man cannot live this life without some hope which will 
          make him strive to pursue the things that he wants to achieve. But the 
          believer should not hope for too much or feel too content with this 
          world, or prefer its pleasures; rather he should strive to make the 
          Hereafter his goal, and work to do righteous deeds which will bring 
          him closer to his Lord, and seek the help of His blessings to obey Him,

So when he purifies himself and stands to pray, he stands humbly, reciting the Book of his Lord or listening to it, pondering its meanings and the meanings of the adhkaar he recites in his prayers. He should not give in to the Shaytaan and his insinuating whispers; when the Shaytaan tries to distract him, he tries harder to focus on his prayers, and seeks refuge with Allah from the accursed Shaytaan.

The scholars stated that it is permissible to make some slight movements during prayer if the worshipper needs to do so.,"Can you use tissues during prayer?


Should you wipe your nose with your right or left hand during prayer?","Praise be to Allah.Can you use tissues during prayer?
It is permissible for a worshipper to use a tissue to stop a runny nose during prayer. The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) stated that it is permissible to make some slight movements during prayer if the worshipper needs to do so, as it says in Al-Majmu` by An-Nawawi (4/94). 
They quoted as evidence many Hadiths that were narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
For example, Abu Dawud (650) narrated that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “While the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was leading his companions in prayer, he took off his shoes and placed them to his left. When the people saw that, they took off their shoes too. When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) finished his prayer he said, ‘What made you take off your shoes?’ They said, 'We saw you taking off your shoes so we took off ours too.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, 'Jibreel (peace be upon him) came to me and told me that there was something dirty on them [my shoes].’ And he said, ‘When any one of you comes to the mosque, let him look at his shoes and if there is anything dirty on them, let him wipe it off and pray in them.’” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud, 605). Al-Khattabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Ma`alim As-Sunan (2/329): this shows that a slight movement does not affect one’s prayer.
If a person needs to wipe his nose while praying , such as one who has a cold or flu, it is allowed for him to take a tissue out and wipe his nose. 
A report was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) which indicates that this movement in prayer is permissible. 
Muslim (855) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw a glob of phlegm in the Qiblah of the mosque. He turned to the people and said, “What is wrong with any one of you who stands before his Lord and expectorates in front of Him? Would any one of you like it if someone were to stand in front of him and expectorate in his face? If any one of you needs to expectorate, let him spit to his left, under his shoe. If he cannot do that, then let him do like this – ” then he spat onto his garment and rub part of it against another part. 
Should you wipe your nose with your right or left hand during prayer? 
The answer is that you should wipe it with your left hand, because in Islam the right hand is only for things that are regarded as honourable , and the left hand is for things that are regarded as unclean. 
Al-Bukhari (163) and Muslim (395) narrated that `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) liked to start with the right when putting on his shoes, combing his hair, purifying himself and in all his affairs.” 
Abu Dawud (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated that `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) also said: “The right hand of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was for his purification [i.e., during Wudu] and food, and his left hand was for cleaning himself after using the toilet and for everything that was unclean.” (Classed as authentic by Al-Bukhari in Sahih Abu Dawud, 26) 
An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Sahih Muslim (1/160): 
principle in Shari`ah. Whatever has to do with honourable things, such as putting on clothes, trousers and socks, entering the mosque, using the miswak (tooth-stick), applying kohl, clipping the nails, trimming the moustache, combing the hair, plucking the armpit hairs, shaving the head, saying Salam at the end of the prayer, washing the limbs in Wudu, coming out of the toilet, eating and drinking, shaking hands, acknowledging the Black Stone, and so on, it is recommended to use the right hand or start on the right. With regard to things that are the opposite, such as entering the toilet, exiting the mosque, wiping one’s nose, cleaning oneself after using the toilet, taking off one’s clothes, trousers and socks, etc., it is recommended to use the left hand or start on the left. All of that is because of the status of the right hand. And Allah knows best.

Their efforts in calling people to Allah cannot be denied. But like many other groups they make some mistakes, and some points should be noted concerning them. For more, see the detailed answer.","What is Jama'at al-Tabligh?


Mistakes of Jama'at al-Tabligh 


Fatwas on Jama'at al-Tabligh","Praise be to Allah.What is Jama'at al-Tabligh?
“Jama’at al-Tabligh ” is one of the groups that are working for Islam. Their efforts in calling people to Allah (da’wah) cannot be denied. But like many other groups they make some mistakes, and some points should be noted concerning them. 
Mistakes of Jama'at al-Tabligh 
These points may be summed up as follows, noting that these mistakes may vary within this group, depending on the environment and society in which they find themselves. In societies in which knowledge and scholars are prevalent and the madhhab of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jama’ah is widespread, the mistakes are much less; in other societies these mistakes may be greater. Some of their mistakes are: 
1 – Not adopting the ‘aqidah of Ahl al-Sunnah wa'l-Jama'ah. This is clearly seen from the variations in the ‘aqidah of some of their members and even of some of their leaders. 
2 – Their not paying attention to shar’i knowledge. 
3 – Their misinterpretation of some Quranic verses in a manner that was not intended by Allah. For example they interpret the verses on jihad as referring to “going out for da’wah”. The verses which mentioned the word khuruj (going out) etc. are interpreted by them as meaning going out for da’wah. 
4 – They make their system of going out for da’wah an act of worship. So they started to misquote the Quran to support their system which specifies certain numbers of days and months. This system, which they think is based on evidence from Quran, is widespread among them in all countries and environments.  
5 – They do some things that go against shari’ah, such as appointing one of them to make du'a for them whilst the group goes out for da’wah, and they think that their success or failure depends on whether or not this man was sincere and his du'a accepted.  
6 – Da’if (weak) and mawdu’ (fabricated) ahadeeth are widespread among them, and this is not befitting for those who aim to call people to Allah.  
7 – They do not speak of munkarat (evil things), thinking that enjoining what is good is sufficient. Hence we find that they do not speak about evils that are widespread among the people, even though the slogan of this ummah – which they continually repeat – is: 
“Let there arise out of you a group of people inviting to all that is good (Islam), enjoining Al-Ma‘ruf (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do) and forbidding Al-Munkar (polytheism and disbelief and all that Islam has forbidden). And it is they who are the successful” [Aal ‘Imran 3:104 – interpretation of the meaning]
The successful are those who enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil, not just those who do only one of the two. 
8 – Some of them fall into self-admiration and arrogance, which leads them to look down on others, and even to look down on the scholars and describe them as inactive and sleeping, or to show off. So you find them talking about how they went out and travelled, and they saw such and such, which leads to unfavourable results, as we have mentioned. 
9 – They regard going out for da’wah as better than many acts of worship such as jihad and seeking knowledge, even though those things are obligatory duties, or may be obligatory for some people but not others. 
10 – Some of them audaciously issue fatwas, and discuss tafsir and hadith. That is because they allow each one of them to address the people and explain to them. This leads to them speaking audaciously on matters of shari’ah. So they inevitably speak of the meaning of a ruling, hadith or verse when they have not read anything about it, or listened to any of the scholars. And some of them are new Muslims or have only recently come back to Islam. 
11- Some of them are negligent with regard to the rights of their children and wives. We have discussed the seriousness of this matter in the answer to question no. 3043 . 
Hence the scholars do not allow people to go out with them, except for those who want to help them and correct the mistakes that they have fallen into. 
We should not keep the people away from them altogether, rather we must try to correct their mistakes and advise them so that their efforts will continue and they will be correct according to the Quran and Sunnah.  
Fatwas on Jama'at al-Tabligh
There follow the fatwas of some of the scholars concerning Jama'at al-Tabligh : 
1 – Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz said: 
“Jama'at al-Tabligh do not have proper understanding of the issues of ‘aqidah, so it is not permissible to go out with them, except for one who has knowledge and understanding of the correct ‘aqidah of Ahl al-Sunnah wa'l-Jama'ah , so that he can guide them and advise them, and cooperate with them in doing good, because they are very active, but they need more knowledge and someone who can guide them of those who have knowledge of Tawheed and the Sunnah. May Allah bless us all with proper understanding of Islam and make us steadfast in adhering to it.” *Majmu’ Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 8/331)                      
2 – Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan said: 
“Going out for the sake of Allah does not refer to the kind of going out that they mean nowadays. Going out for the sake of Allah means going out to fight. What they call going out nowadays is a bid’ah (innovation) that was not narrated from the salaf. 
Going out to call people to Allah cannot be limited to a certain number of days, rather one should call people to Allah according to one's abilities, without limiting that to a group or to forty days or more or less than that. 
Similarly the da’iyah must have knowledge. It is not permissible for a person to call people to Allah when he is ignorant. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say (O Muhammad): This is my way; I invite unto Allah (i.e. to the Oneness of Allah — Islamic Monotheism) with sure knowledge” [Yusuf 12:108], i.e., with knowledge, because the caller must know that to which he calls people, what is obligatory, mustahabb, haram and makruh. He has to know what shirk, sin, kufr, immorality and disobedience are; he has to know the degrees of denouncing evil and how to do it. 
The kind of going out that distracts people from seeking knowledge is wrong, because seeking knowledge is an obligation, and it can only be achieved by learning, not by inspiration. This is one of the misguided Sufi myths, because action without knowledge is misguidance, and hoping to acquire knowledge without learning is an illusion.” (Thalath Muhadarat fi’l-‘Ilm wa’l-Da’wah)

in the second Ayat of Surat Al-Baqarah. What happen if the Imam refuses to correct himself even though he knows he made a mistake, but he thinks it is not necessary to correct himself.Will the Salat be void if the meaning changed and the Imams was not corrected?. Can we correct the Imam if he makes a mistake in Qranic Reading during Friday Kuttbah. How about if he makes a mistake in the explanations saying ""Unbeleiver will be in Jannah and beleiver will be in the fire "".",,,"Praise be to Allah.If the imam makes a mistake in his recitation – apart from al-Fatihah – that does not alter the meaning, then you do not have to correct his mistake. This is something that no imam is entirely free from. But it is better to point it out to him after the prayer, because this will help him to remember it. 
But if the imam refuses to correct his mistake even though he knows it is a mistake, then one to the following two scenarios applies: 
1 – If the mistake alters the meaning, and he knows that it is a mistake but he does not correct his mistake after it has been pointed out to him, then you must repeat the prayer. 
But how can you be sure that he realized it is a mistake and was persisting in it?  
But if it is a mistake that does not alter the meaning, then you do not have to repeat the prayer, but you must advise the imam in a kind and gentle manner, and explain that it is not something shameful if the imam forgets something, for the best of Allah’s creation, Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), also forgot, and the Sahaabah who were behind him reminded him, as is mentioned in the hadith. 
Shaykh Sa’d al-Humayd 
With regard to correcting the Jumu’ah khutbah, this is one of the cases in which speaking during the khutbah is permitted, such as if the khateeb makes a mistake in reciting a verse that changes the meaning, such as omitting a phrase from the aayah and so on. In this case the one who corrects him is not regarded as coming under the prohibition on speaking during the khutbah. See al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 5/140.",Islam Q&A

    There is no contradiction between this aayah and the fact 
    that the fast is broken after the sun sets, because night begins when the 
    sun sets. The beginning of the night is sunset, and the end of the night is 
    when dawn comes. Hence the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “When night comes, and day ends, and the sun has set, then 
    let the fasting person break his fast.” What the hadeeth means is that when 
    the sun has set, night has begun and day has ended, and at that time it 
    becomes permissible for the fasting person to break his fast. See Sharh 
    Muslim by al-Nawawi (7/209).
