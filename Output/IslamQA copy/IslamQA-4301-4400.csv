          said, has no basis (in Islam). Yes, there is sujood al-shukr (prostration 
          of thanksgiving) which is prescribed when a new blessing comes or something 
          bad is warded off, but this is no longer applicable when such a long 
          time has passed.

 If 
          you had done the prostration of thanksgiving when your daughter was 
          born safe and sound and her mother was fine, we would say that this 
          is good, and is an action prescribed by Islam. But allocating a specific 
          time of forty days, and saying that it has to be done in the mosque, 
          is bid’ah. May Allaah help us and you to do all that is good.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
4309,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4309,It      is not permissible to show any kind of disrespect towards graves,"In our village the graves have been subjected to disrespect. The graveyard has become a pathway for camels, cattle and goats, and a route for cars. Even worse than that, some people have applied to build on the graves. What is your view about this matter?",,,"Praise be to Allah.This is not permissible, because it is not permissible to interfere with graves in any way so long as any remains of the dead are still to be found in them. The sanctity of the dead is like the sanctity of the living. So it is not permissible to subject graves to any disrespect, whether by stepping on them, making them pathways, praying in the graveyard, or making them part of people’s dwelling-places. None of these things are allowed, unless the occupants of the graves have turned to dust and there is nothing left of their bodies. In that case, it is OK to use the graveyards for fields or houses or other purposes. But so long as any trace of the dead bodies are left, it is not permissible to use them or walk on them, because the dead Muslim came to this place before you; he got there first so he has more right to it. His sanctity when he is dead is the same as his sanctity when he was alive. When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw a man step on a grave, he said: “If one of you were to sit on a live coal that burned his garment and reached his skin, that would be better for him than sitting on a grave.” (Narrated by Muslim, 9711; Abu Dawood, 3228). This is a warning, because of the disrespect towards that Muslim that is involved. The scholars stated that it is haraam to relieve oneself in between graves, and that it is not permitted to sit on a grave, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not sit on graves, and do not pray towards them.” (Narrated by Muslim, no. 972; Abu Dawood, no. 3229). We should not lean on graves, or step on them, or show any disrespect towards them; all of that is not allowed. And Allah is the Source of strength.","From Fataawa al-Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Humayd, p. 161"
4318,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4318,"Her husband did
    not respect her family and divorced her after the nikaah but before the wedding party","I have a two part question.
      First of all, I recently divorced from my husband. There were many reasons but the main
      reason was that he disrespected my mother and father by talking to them very harshly not
      once but several times. I figured if he could not respect my parents how could he possibly
      respect me? I love my parents very much and I don't like to see them hurt. My question is
      what is a husband's role in Islam in repect to his wife . Isn't he suppose to respect her
      family also? Once a woman gets married does it mean that the husband is first priority and
      that her parents come in second? 
      Secondly, I only had the Nikkah done, the rukhsati was going to be in April but I still
      lost my virginity. Now I fear my ex-husband will tell this in court which will be a cause
      of extreme embarassment for me in front of my parents especially my father. According to
      Islam, is it wrong to lose one's virginity before rukhsati?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The parents have great rights, but the husband has a
    greater right. It is not permissible for either party to abuse the rights of the other. If
    the wife thinks that her husband has wronged her parents, she should advise him and remind
    him that the aayah (interpretation of the meaning),  and live with them
    [wives] honourably [al-Nisa 4:19] includes treating her family well
    too, because that makes her happy, and it includes not harming them, because that upsets
    her. By the same token, if one or both of her parents abuse her husbands rights, she
    should advise them and remind them of the seriousness of backbiting, wrongdoing and
    aggression. If they order her to do something and her husband orders her to do the
    opposite, then her husband takes precedence, because his rights are greater in
    shareeah. This does not mean that she should forget about their rights; this is the
    guideline she should follow in cases where there is a conflict.
With regard to your second question, it is not haraam according to
    shareeah for a man to have intercourse with his wife after the nikaah (conclusion of
    the marriage contract) and before the wedding party. Whatever happened after the nikaah is
    halaal (permissible), so there is no scandal involved and no need to fear the
    consequences. If a man divorces his wife after the marriage has been consummated, then she
    is entitled to keep the entire mahr (dowry)
If it is possible for mediators to try to bring you back together in
    accordance with shareeah and following the proper etiquette, then this is better.

4319,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4319,A Jewish Woman Thinking About Embracing Islam,"I have very difficult question and I think this is my only hope that you can help me to find the answer.
I am a Russian Jewish girl and I know this Muslim guy for over a year. The longer we know each other, the more problems and difficulties we face. Not in the religious or cultural ways. We love each other and there is an issue of whether he can marry me or not.
He is a very good Muslim and he comes from traditional family. I am very fond of his beliefs and beliefs of his family. I was born in a very agnostic country and couldn't be properly introduced into any religion. It was forbidden. When I came to the US I started my research on different religions and found out that my beliefs do not really match all Jewish sayings. I did a lot of research on Islam and by looking at him and a couple other Muslim boys and girls, and by reading Quaran, I have a very strong feeling that I could become a good Muslim. I want to go to school to learn the culture and religion more precisely, to learn the language. I contacted the mosque and was ready to go... but I faced the issue: would I be accepted as a Muslim sister like other people who came from different religions except Jewish? Jews and Muslims are in big contradictions and I know that friendship is almost impossible. I am praying to God (in my home language - Russian), to lead me the right way to achieve my beliefs.
Please, help me to find my answers!",,,"Praise be to Allah.“I have a very strong feeling that I could become a good Muslim.” The way you express yourself so clearly in your message indicates that you are indeed open to the truth and have been sincerely seeking for it.
“I am praying to God (in my home language –Russian), to lead me to the right way…” What you say here, at the end of your message, makes the Muslim reader feel deeply moved by the story of a woman who has turned towards Allah after realizing that He answers the prayers of those who call on Him and ask for guidance to the right way. Allah says in the Quran (interpretation of the meaning): “And when My slaves ask you (O Muhammad) concerning Me, then (answer them), I am indeed near (to them, by My knowledge). I respond to the invocations of the supplicant when he calls on Me (without any mediator or intercessor). So let them obey Me and believe in Me, so that they may be led aright.” [al-Baqarah 2:186]. It is a good sign that your heart appears to be open to Islam. Allah also tells us in the Quran: “And whomsoever Allah wills to guide, He opens his breast to Islam, and whomsoever He wills to send astray, He makes his breast closed and constricted, as if he is climbing up to the sky…” [al-An’aam 6:125]
Please note that Muslims who understand their religion properly will not feel any kind of reservation or resentment towards any brother or sister who embraces Islam, no matter what their origins. The fact that a new Muslim comes from a Jewish or Christian background should not be a reason for any kind of discrimination or prejudice. We will give you two examples from Islamic history of two Jews – one man and one woman – who entered Islam.
The first one is Abu Yoosuf ‘Abd-Allah ibn Salaam (may Allah be pleased with him). Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “When ‘Abd-Allah ibn Salaam heard that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had come to Madeenah, he came to him and said, ‘I am going to ask you about three things which no one knows except a Prophet. What is the first Sign of the Hour? What is the first food that the people of Paradise will eat? And how is it that a child may resemble either his father or his maternal uncles?’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Jibreel has just now informed me about these.’ ‘Abd-Allah ibn Salaam said, ‘He is the enemy of the Jews among the angels.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘The first sign of the Hour is a fire that will gather the people together from the East to the West. The first food that the people of Paradise will eat will be the caudate (extra) lobe of fish-liver. As for the child resembling one parent or another, when a man has intercourse with his wife, if the man’s discharge precedes the woman’s discharge, the child will resemble the man, and if the woman’s discharge precedes the man’s, the child will resemble the woman.” [‘Abd-Allah] said: ‘I bear witness that you are the Messenger of Allah…’” (Reported by al-Bukhari, 3082).
Al-Bukhari also reported: “ ‘Abd-Allah ibn Salaam came and said: ‘I bear witness that you are the Messenger of Allah and that you have brought the truth. The Jews know that I am the best of them and the son of the best of them, and I am the most knowledgeable of them and the son of the most knowledgeable of them, so call them and ask them about me before they know that I have become Muslim, for if they know that I have become Muslim, they will say things about me that are not true.’ The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sent for them and they came to him. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to them, ‘O Jews, woe to you! Fear Allah, for by Allah besides Whom there is no other god, you know that I am truly the Messenger of Allah and that I come to you with the truth, so become Muslim.’ They said, ‘We know nothing about that.’ He said it three times… He said, ‘What kind of man is ‘Abd-Allah ibn Salaam among you?’ They said, ‘He is the best of us and the son of the best of us; he is the most knowledgeable of us and the son of the most knowledgeable among us.’ He said, ‘What would you think if he became Muslim?’ They said, ‘May Allah protect him from that! He would never become Muslim.’ He said, ‘What would you think if he became Muslim?’ They said, ‘May Allah protect him from that! He would never become Muslim.’ He said, ‘What would you think if he became Muslim?’ They said, ‘May Allah protect him from that! He would never become Muslim.’ He said, ‘O son of Salaam, come out to them.’ He [‘Abd-Allah] came out and said, ‘O Jews, fear Allah! By Allah besides Whom there is no other god, you know that he is the Messenger of Allah and that he has come with the truth.’ They said, ‘You are lying!’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told them to leave.” (Reported by al-Bukhari, 3621)
This man’s Jewish origins did not prevent him from being one of those who were given the glad tidings of Paradise before they died. Sa’d ibn Abi Waqqaas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I never heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saying to any man who walked on the face of the earth that he would be one of the people of Paradise except for ‘Abd-Allah ibn Salaam. Concerning him, the aayah - verse (interpretation of the meaning) ‘… and a witness from among the Children of Israel testifies that this Quran is from Allah…’ [al-Ahqaaf 46:10] was revealed.”
The Jewish woman who became Muslim was Safiyyah bint Huyay ibn Akhtab, from the Jews of Khaybar, who believed in Allah as her Lord, Islam as her religion, and Muhammad as her Prophet.
This Jewish woman Safiyyah, who embraced Islam, became a mother for all of us Muslims, as Allah said in the Quran (interpretation of the meaning): “The Prophet is closer to the believers than their own selves, and his wives are their mothers…” [al-Ahzaab 33:6].
Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stayed between Khaybar and Madeenah for three days when he got married to Safiyyah bint Huyay, and invited the Muslims to his waleemah (wedding feast)… The Muslims said, ‘Is she one of the Mothers of the Believers or is she one of those whom his right hand possesses?’ They said, ‘If he covers her, then she is one of the Mothers of the Believers and if he does not cover her, then she is one of those whom his right hand possesses.’ When he got on his camel, he made her ride behind him, and he put a screen between her and the people.” (Reported by al-Bukhari, 4762).
Safiyyah (may Allah be pleased with her) was the one for whom the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came out of seclusion (I’tikaaf) especially to accompany her to her house. (The one who is in seclusion for worship is not allowed to come out except for a valid reason). ‘Ali ibn al-Husayn (may Allah be pleased with them both) reported that Safiyyah, the wife of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told him that she came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to visit him whilst he was in I’tikaaf (seclusion) in the mosque, during the last ten days of Ramadaan. She spoke with him for a while, then she wanted to go back to her house, so the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) got up and took her back… (Reported by al-Bukhari, 1894)
According to another report: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was in the mosque, and his wives were with him, then they left. He said to Safiyyah bint Huyay, “Don’t rush, I will go with you.” Her home was in the house of Usaamah, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went out with her … (Reported by al-Bukhari, 1897). 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to take care of her and show compassion towards her. Anas ibn  Maalik, the servant of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) described how he took care of his wife Safiyyah on a journey: “I saw the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) spreading his cloak for her to sit on it, then kneeling down and putting his knee for her to step on in order to get onto the camel.” (Reported by al-Bukhari, 2081). 
These examples and others make it clear that the new Muslim has his or her rightful place in Islam, regardless of whether his background is Jewish or anything else. If some Muslims reject a Jewish man or woman who has become Muslim, this is because of their ignorance and shortcomings; as far as the Islamic view is concerned, you know what it is [Islam welcomes all newcomers]. So hasten to enter Islam at once, and we are sure that you will be happy with your new life in this religion. 
It only remains for us to comment on one other matter you mention in your question, which is your relationship with the Muslim man you refer to. This relationship will not be acceptable to Allah unless it is on the basis of marriage, which Allah has prescribed for His slaves, and which He accepts as the way for men and women to have relationships. We imagine that in your case, as you describe it, your becoming Muslim and repenting will open the doors and pave the way for you to have a proper relationship (i.e., marriage) with this Muslim man. 
We ask Allah to guide you to the truth and help you adhere to it, to give you goodness in this world and grant you the victory of Paradise in the Hereafter.

This needs a quick response if you can , for dawah purposes. 
Jazak Allaahu Khair.",,,"Praise be to Allah.We sent this question to our
      Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Barraak, who replied as follows:
Among
      the basic principles of faith are Belief in all the Books that have been
      revealed from Allaah, and belief in all the Messengers. These two
      principles include belief in the noblest of Books, which is the Qur’aan,
      and the best of the Messengers, namely Muhammad 
 (peace and blessings
      of Allaah be upon him), the Seal of the Messengers and the Messenger of
      Allaah to all of mankind from the time when Allaah sent him until the time
      when the Hour will begin. Every person from every nation must believe in
      him and follow him and rule by his sharee’ah (laws). Whoever claims to
      believe in him and in the Qur’aan, but does not rule according to it or
      follow him in everything that he brought and believe everything he told
      us, is not a Muslim or a believer. If he dies like this then he will be
      one of the people of Hell. If he claims to believe in Allaah Alone, with
      no partner or associate, and in all the Messengers, belief in the
      Messenger and in the Qur’aan does not only mean believing that they are
      true, without following them and ruling according to what they say. Many
      of the Mushrikeen believed in the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and
      blessings of Allaah be upon him) in their hearts, and there were those who
      believed in him in their hearts and in the words they spoke, but this did
      not benefit them at all, like his uncle Abu Taalib. This belief did not
      help them at all when they insisted on not following. Similarly, the Jews
      and Christians who knew himas
      they knew their sons, and who admitted that they believed in the Messenger
      
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), but this knowledge and
      belief did not benefit them at all when they refused to follow him. They
      were kaafirs and Allaah decreed their blood and their wealth to be
      permissible for His Messenger 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
      him), so he fought them, and Allaah caused him to prevail over them, and
      His religion to prevail over all other religions. Allaah says
      (interpretation of the meaning):
“It is He Who has sent His
      Messenger (Muhammad 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)) with
      guidance and the religion of truth (islam), to make it superior over all
      religions, even though the Mushrikoon (polytheists, pagans, idolaters,
      disbelievers in the Oneness of Allaah) hate (it).” [al-Tawbah 9:33]
So
      every Jew and Christian has to enter the religion of Islam which Allaah
      revealed to His Prophet Muhammad 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be
      upon him), because the Message of Muhammad is the final Message, which
      abrogates the previous religions. Allaah says (interpretation of the
      meaning):
“And whoever seeks a
      religion other than islam, it will never be accepted of him” [Aal
      ‘Imraan 3:85]
According
      to a saheeh hadeeth: “By the One in Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad,
      there is no one among this ummah, Jew or Christian, who hears of me than
      dies without believing in that with which I have been sent, but he will be
      one of the people of Hellfire.” (Reported by Muslim, 218).
On
      this basis, the religion of any Jew or Christian will not be correct
      unless he believes in the sharee’ah of Islam and adheres to the rulings
      of the Holy Qur’aan. The Qur’aan is Muhaymin (i.e., it
      testifies to the truth that is in the previous scriptures and exposes the
      falsehood that has been added to them), and it abrogates the previous
      Books. The Tawraat (Torah) and Injeel (Gospel) have been abrogated and
      have been changed and altered. And Allaah knows best.",Islam Q&A - Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
4329,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4329,Accusing a Muslim of drinking    wine,What is the ruling on someone (muslim) saying lies about his other brother.i.e saying he drinks Alcohol and other sort of things.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Accusing a Muslim of doing an evil deed without proof is a major sin which deserves punishment. Talking about it to other people is a kind of gheebah (backbiting, gossip) which Allaah has forbidden and likened to a person eating the flesh of his dead brother, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):
“… neither backbite one another. Would one of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother? You would hate it (so hate backbiting). And fear Allaah. Verily, Allaah is the One Who accepts repentance, Most Merciful.”[al-Hujuraat 49:12]
“Verily, those who like that (the crime of) illegal sexual should be propagated among those who believe, they will have a painful torment in this world and in the Hereafter…” [al-Noor 24:19].
Whoever slanders his brother or accuses him of an evil deed has to repent to Allaah, ask his brother’s forgiveness, and avoid everything that causes harm to a fellow Muslim. Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever believes in Allaah and the Last Day, let him say something good or else remain silent.”
(Reported by al-Bukhaari, 11/256, and by Muslim, no. 47). Abu Dharr (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: ‘No man accuses another of an immoral deed or kufr, but it will come back on him, if the person he accuses is not as he says he is.’” (Reported by al-Bukhari, 10/388). Accusing a Muslim of drinking wine is the same as accusing him of an immoral deed (fisq), and whoever accuses his brother of something he is not guilty of, Allaah will make him fall into the thing he of which he accused his brother. A man was brought to ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Abbaas, and he was told, “This is so and so, his beard was dripping with wine.” [Ibn ‘Abbaas] said, “We were forbidden to spy on others, but if something is obvious to us, we will accept it and act accordingly.” (Reported by Abu Dawood, 4890, who said it is a saheeh hasan hadeeth).
It is not permissible for the Muslim to spy on his Muslim brother or to seek out his faults. If he accidentally sees him in a doubtful place or seeming to behave in a doubtful manner, he should not accuse him unless he sees him with his own eyes doing a wrongful action. He should advise and counsel him, then if he insists on doing that thing, and there is fear that he may harm other Muslims, or if one is asked about him for a legitimate reason, then he should tell those who have something to do with it about what he knows. But he should not broadcast it unless the person does the evil action openly, because this will only help the Shaytaan against him and stop him from repenting.

      Khira.",,,"Praise be to Allah.A kind word opens the doors to people’s hearts and
    removes enmity from them, and tolerance, forgiveness and sincerity restore love between
    people. When a person speaks a kind word and turns a blind eye to bad treatment, he earns
    people’s respect and makes the one who has done something bad apologize for his bad
    behaviour or stop persisting in it. Undoubtedly some people may choose a way of dealing
    with people that they themselves would not like to be dealt with, and they think that
    being tough and confrontational is what will make people respect them. When a person
    insists on persisting in sin, and faces harsh criticism, he finds himself lost in a
    vicious circle of hatred and revenge, so he can no longer tell right from wrong or true
    from false. So nobody can advise him, because whatever is said is taken as the opening of
    a confrontation or a continuation of enmity, and he is always watching and waiting for
    trouble. It is safer in this case to think about how we are going to deal with such a
    person, so we leave him alone for a while, trying to calm his fears of criticism and being
    called to account. We use some kind words, gentleness and smiles to make him feel that we
    forgive him and care about him. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“… Repel (the evil) with one which is better (i.e., Allaah
    ordered the faithful believers to be patient at the time of anger, and to excuse those who
    treat them badly), then verily! He between whom and you there was enmity, (will become) as
    though he was a close friend. But none is granted it (the above quality), except those who
    are patient, and none is granted it except the owner of the great portion (of happiness in
    the Hereafter, i.e., Paradise, and in this world of a high moral
    character).”[Fussilat 41:35]
Leaving the person alone does not mean cutting all ties and
    refraining from returning greetings or talking to him; what it does mean is avoiding
    mixing with him so that we give him the opportunity to prepare himself to accept advice.
    Then we can start by mentioning his good points and saying what good things we wish for
    him and the hopes we have for him. Then we can give him advice (naseehah) in an
    appropriate manner, without hurting his feelings, offending him or boring him. We should
    do this in the hope of earning reward from Allaah, and with patience and tolerance. From
    our behaviour and good treatment we should set an example to the one whom we wish to
    advise. We should listen to the direction given by Allaah to His Messenger (interpretation
    of the meaning):
“Show forgiveness, enjoin what is good, and turn away from the
    foolish (i.e., don’t punish them).”[al-A’raaf 7:199]
Rushing to condemn and criticize without looking for the
    appropriate moment usually leads to the opposite of the desired results. Humility and a
    gentle approach lifts barriers and removes aggression and hostility. According to a saheeh
    hadeeth narrated by ‘Ayaad (may Allaah be pleased with him), the Messenger of Allaah 
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah has revealed to me that you

In many restaurants in the West, food such as fish, potato fries, chicken are fried in large deep fat fryers.
The large fryer contains a large amount of oil.
Is it permissible to eat fish and potato fries which have been cooked in this oil, if non-halaal meat and /or pork has also been fried in it ?
And is it necessary to ask the shopkeeper whether he fries everything in the same oil, or should you not ask and just eat ?

This is the opinion of al-Shaafa’i, Maalik and Ahmad
(Bidaayah al-Mujtahid, 1/162; al-Majmoo’, 4/213; al-Mughni, 2/255). Their evidence for this was the hadeeth narrated by Ibn ‘Abbas, according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “O people of Makkah, do not shorten your prayers for a distance less than four birad from Makkah to ‘Asfaan.” (Reported by al-Daaraqutni,3/139). Some of the scholars have calculated this in current measurements as being equivalent to approximately eighty kilometers.
The length of time one is travelling
The Shaafa’is and Maalikis said: if he intends to stay for four days, he should do the prayers in full, because Allah allowed us to shorten the prayers provided that one is moving and travelling.
They used as evidence the report narrated by al-‘Ala’ ibn al-Hadrami that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The non-resident should stay in Makkah for three days after completing the rites of Hajj.”
(Reported by Ibn Maajah, 1/341).
The Hanbalis said that if he intends to stay more than four days he should do the prayers in full. They used as evidence the hadeeth of Jaabir (may Allah be pleased with him) who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came to Makkah on the morning of the fourth of Dhoo’l-Hijjah, and stayed there on the fourth, fifth and sixth, and prayed Subh (Fajr) on the eighth day. then he went out to Mina, and he used to shorten his prayers.
It is better for you to do your prayers in full when you are at work, because you will be staying there for more than twenty fard prayers, meaning more than four days, and most of the four Imaams said that the person who wants to stay in a place for this length of time should do the prayers in full. To be on the safe side and to avoid being subject to any blame, it is better to do the prayers in full. With regard to the time when you are actually travelling, by land or sea or air, for the distance mentioned in the question, then you know that the Sunnah is to shorten your prayers.

4381,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4381,Acquire    the knowledge of Quran and Sunnah,", over about the last two years I have found my dreams frequently coming true. Once In my dream I was looking at the first few words of surah 3, verse 17 which I didn't know of before and only recognized once I bought a copy of The Noble Qur'an and remembered how I had seen a few long words in one line, all spaced out.
I even distinctly remember seeing the word 'walmunfiqeen' which at the time of my dream,I thought said 'munaafiqeena',subhaan Allah. At another time, I saw myself going up a kind of ramp at the beginning of which was an arrow marked 'prophets'. It led me to an interior where I felt the bodies of prophets were kept and I felt a bit scared.
What came to my mind then was that 25 prophets are mentioned in the Qur'an. And there are other dreams which I cannot all talk about now. But recently I have been seeing myself in my dreams looking at Islamic books in shops and unknown places and asking about books of Hadith.
I feel that I should be doing something for Islaam and showing my gratitude to Allah. Please advise me on what I might have to do and how might be the best way of going about it. At the moment, I am in my final year at university. Your reply is eagerly awaited.
Jazak-Allah Khair,",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is obvious that your dreams illustrate a strong desire to acquire the knowledge of Quran and Sunnah. It is with no doubt, the best thing a Muslim could spend his time, money and effort pursuing. A Muslim who acquires this knowledge not only benefits himself; he benefits others as well. Our Prophet salla Allah alaihi wasallam told us that Acquiring the knowledge of Quran and Sunnah is a must on every Muslim and that the Angles are so pleased with the Muslim who pursues this knowledge, they put their wings down for him. This indicates how important this issue is. Yet you should make sure that your intention in learning is solely for Allah, and not to show of or to attract attention. Your recall of the word Almunafiqeen, which means the hypocrites, might be a warning sign that you must correct your intention in all acts. Remember that Allah accepts only the deeds that are entirely done for Him alone.
Being a good learned Muslim who learns and teaches Islam to others is one of the best ways of showing your gratitude towards Allah, and Allah knows best.

      ceremonies or is this not allowed?",,,"Praise be to Allah.In principle, the wedding party and waleemah should be
    done at the time when the groom enters upon his bride, because one of the aims of the

4395,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4395,"A Christian asks
    about the nature and definition of the soul","With regard to Islam, what is the soul? For
      instance, who created the soul, and what limitations does it have?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Allaah is the Creator of all things, and the soul is
    something that has been created just like everything else. The knowledge about its true
    essence is something that belongs exclusively to Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted.
    Allaah has kept this knowledge exclusively to Himself, as is stated in the hadeeth of
    Abd-Allaah ibn Masood (may Allaah be pleased with him), who said: Whilst
    I was with the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) on a farm, and he was
    resting on a palm branch stripped of its leaves, the Jews passed by, and some of them said
    to others, Ask him about the soul. Some of them said, What urges you to
    ask him about it? Others of them said, Dont ask him in case he says
    something you dislike. But they said, Ask him, so they asked him about
    the soul. The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) kept quiet and did not
    respond to them, and I knew that he was receiving Revelation, so I stayed where I was.
    When the Revelation of the aayah was complete, he said (interpretation of the meaning): And
    they ask you [O Muhammad] concerning the rooh [the spirit]. Say: The rooh: it is one
    of the things, the knowledge of which is only with my Lord. And of knowledge, you
    (mankind) have been given only a little. [al-Isra 17:85] (Reported
    by al-Bukhaari). The rooh (soul or spirit) has been described by
    Allaah in His Book and by the Messenger 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in
    his Sunnah, and various verbs and adjectives have been used in conjunction with the word
    rooh, such as seizing or grasping, taking (as in death), it may be
    fettered or shrouded, it comes and goes, it goes up and comes down, it may be pulled out
    like a hair being pulled out of dough It is obligatory (in Islam) to believe in
    these attributes which are narrated in the two Revelations (i.e., the
    Quraan and Sunnah), and also to realize that the soul is not like the body.
    Allaah created Adam and breathed the soul into him, as is stated in the
    Quraan and in the hadeeth of the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
    him): When Allaah created Adam and breathed the soul into him, he sneezed and said
    Al-hamdu-Lillah (Praise be to Allaah). He praised Allaah by His
    permission. Then his Lord said to him, May Allaah have mercy on you, O Adam. Go to
    those angels, to a group of them who are sitting, and say, As-salaamu
    alaykum (peace be upon you). They said, Wa alayka al-salaam
    wa rahmat-Allaah (and upon you be peace and the Mercy of Allaah). Then he went
    back to his Lord, who said, This is your greeting and the greeting of your
    descendants amongst themselves. (Reported and classed as hasan by
    al-Tirmidhi. Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 3290).
    Allaah sends the angel to breathe the soul into the
    foetus as was reported by Abd-Allaah ibn Masood, who said: The Messenger
    of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who is the most truthful (of human
    beings) and his being truthful (is a fact) told us: The constituents of one of you
    is gathered in his mothers womb for forty days, then it becomes a clot of blood
    within another period of forty days. Then it becomes a lump of flesh, and forty days
    later, Allaah sends His angel to it to breathe into it the soul. The angel comes with
    instructions concerning four things, so the angel writes down his livelihood, his death,
    his deeds and whether he will doomed or blessed. (Reported by Muslim, 1528).
    The soul of the deceased is taken from the ends of the
    toes towards the top of the body, and when it reaches the throat, the death rattle sounds
    in the throat of the person who is about to die, and his eyes glaze over and roll upwards.
    Um Salamah said: The Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
    him) entered upon Abu Salamah (after he had died) and his eyes were open, so he closed
    them then said, When the soul is taken, the eyes follow it. (Reported
    by Muslim, 1528).
    The soul is met by the angels. The Prophet 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The angels met the soul of a man from among
    the people who came before you, and said, Did you do anything good? He said,
    'I used to tell my employees to postpone collection of payment or to let off anyone who
    was in difficulty. So it was said, Let him off. (Reported
    by al-Bukhaari, 1935).
    The soul is taken up to heaven by two angels after it is
    taken (i.e., after a person dies), as was reported in the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah who
    said: When the soul of the believer is taken, it is met by two angels who take it
    up (The narrator said: then he mentioned its good fragrance and scent of
    musk). The people of heaven say, A good soul that has come from earth, may Allaah
    bless you and the body in which you used to dwell. Then they take it up to its Lord, may
    He be glorified and exalted, then He says, Roam with it until the end of the
    world. When the disbelievers soul comes out (the narrator mentioned its
    putrid smell and curses). The people of heaven say, An evil soul that has come from
    earth, then it is said, Roam with it until the end of the world. Abu
    Hurayrah said: then the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)
    put a piece of cloth over his nose, like this. (Reported by Muslim, 5119).
    More information about how the soul comes out (at death)
    was reported in the hadeeth of Imaam Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on him) from
    al-Bara ibn Aazib who said: We went out with the Prophet 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) for the funeral of a man from among the Ansaar, and we
    reached the grave whilst it was still being dug. The Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) sat down and we sat down around him, and it was as if we
    had birds on our heads. In his hand was a stick with which he was scratching in the earth.
    He raised his head and said, Seek refuge with Allaah from the punishment of the
    grave, two or three times. Then he said, Verily, when the believing slave is
    about to depart this world and enter the Hereafter, there come down to him angels from
    heaven with white faces, as if their faces are the sun. They bring with them one of the
    shrouds of Paradise and some of the perfume of Paradise. They sit with him as far as the
    eye can see. Then the Angel of Death (peace be upon him) comes to him and sits by his head
    and says, O pure soul, come out to the forgiveness and pleasure of Allaah.
    Then his soul comes flowing out like a drop of water flowing from a cup. Then he takes the
    soul, and no sooner does he seize it but they take it and place it in that shroud and
    perfume. Then out of it comes the most excellent fragrance of musk to be found on the face
    of the earth. Then they ascend with it and they do not pass by any group of angels but the
    angels ask, Who is this pure soul? and they reply, It is So and so the
    son of So and so  using the best names by which he was known on earth. Then
    they bring it to the lowest heaven, and ask for it to be opened, and it is opened for him.
    Those who are of high rank in each heaven accompany it until they approach the next
    heaven, and so it goes until it reaches the seventh heaven. Then Allaah, may He be
    glorified and exalted, says: Record the book of My slave in Illiyoon (the
    highest heaven) and take him back to the earth, for I created them from it, and I shall
    return them to it, then I shall take them out from it again. Then his soul is
    returned to his body and two angels come and make him sit up, and ask him, Who is
    your Lord. He says, Allaah. They ask, What is your religion?
    He says, My religion is Islam. They ask, Who is this man that was sent
    amongst you? He says, He is the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him. They ask him, What knowledge do you have? He says,
    'I read the Book of Allaah and I believed in it. Then a voice will call out from
    heaven, My slave has spoken the truth. Prepare for him a bed from Paradise and give
    him clothes from Paradise, and open for him a door to Paradise. And he will feel its
    breeze and smell its fragrance, and his grave will be widened for him as far as his eye
    can see. Then a man with a handsome face, beautiful clothes and a pleasant fragrance will
    come to him and say, Good news! This is the day that you were promised. He
    will say, Who are you? You face looks as if it brings good news. He will say,
    'I am your good deeds. (The deceased) will say, O Lord, let the Hour come so
    that I may see my family and my wealth again. 
When the disbelieving slave is about to depart this world and enter the
    Hereafter, there come down to him angels from heaven with black faces, bringing with them
    sackcloth. They sit with him as far as the eye can see. Then the Angel of Death comes to
    him and sits by his head and says, O evil soul, come out to the wrath and anger of
    Allaah. Then his soul disperses in his body and is dragged out like a skewer being
    pulled out of wet wool. Then he takes the soul, and no sooner does he seize it but they
    take it and place it in that sackcloth. Then out of it comes the most putrid stench of
    rotten flesh to be found on the face of the earth. Then they ascend with it and they do
    not pass by any group of angels but the angels ask, Who is this evil soul? and
    they reply, It is So and so the son of So and so  using the worst names
    by which he was known on earth. Then they bring it to the lowest heaven, and ask for it to
    be opened, and it is not opened for him. Then the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) recited (interpretation of the meaning): 
    For them the gates of heaven will not be opened, and they will not enter Paradise until
    the camel goes through the eye of the needle [al-Araaf 7:40]. Then he
    said, Then Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, says: Record the book of
    My slave in Sijjeen (the lowest Hell) in the lowest earth. Then his soul is cast
    down. Then he recited (interpretation of the meaning):  and whoever
    assigns partners to Allaah, it is as if he had fallen from the sky, and the birds had
    snatched him, or the wind had thrown him to a far off place. [al-Hajj 22:31]. He
    said, Then his soul is returned to his body and two angels come and make him sit up,
    and ask him, Who is your Lord. He says, Oh, oh, I dont know.
    They ask, What is your religion? He says, Oh, oh, I dont
    know. They ask, Who is this man that was sent amongst you? He says,
    Oh, oh, I dont know. Then a voice will call out from heaven, He is
    lying. Prepare for him a bed from Hell and open for him a door to Hell. And he will
    feel its hot winds and smell its stench, and his grave will be constricted for him until
    his ribs interlock. Then a man with an ugly face, ugly clothes and a horrible stench will
    come to him and say, Bad news! This is the day that you were warned about. He
    will say, Who are you? You face looks as if it brings bad news. He will say,
    'I am your evil deeds. (The deceased) will say, O Lord, do not let the Hour
    come! (Musnad al-Imaam Ahmad, 17803; this is a saheeh hadeeth).
    At the end of time, Allaah will send a wind which will
    take the soul of every believer, as was reported in the hadeeth of al-Nawwaas ibn
    Samaan, who said: The Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be
    upon him) mentioned  (the coming of the Dajjaal [Antichrist] and the descent of
    Eesa [Jesus], peace be upon him, and the good life and happiness of mankind at the
    time of Jesus and afterwards). He said, And whilst the people are living like that,
    Allaah will send a good wind which will seize them under the armpits and will take the
    soul of every believer and every Muslim. The evil people will remain and they will behave
    like donkeys, then the Hour will come upon them. (Reported by Muslim,
    5228).
    When people sleep (and sleep is the lesser
    death), the soul is taken, but not completely, so the sleeper is still alive. Allaah
    says (interpretation of the meaning): It is Allaah Who takes away the souls at
    the time of their death, and those that die not during their sleep, He keeps those (souls)
    for which He has ordained death and sends the rest for a term appointed. Verily, in this
    are signs for a people who think deeply. [al-Zumar 39:42]
The Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)
    advised the Muslim, when he lies down to sleep, to say: Bismika Rabbee
    wadatu janbi wa bika arfauhu wa in amsakta nafsi farhamhaa wa in arsaltahaa
    fahfazhaa bimaa tuhfaz bihi ibaadika al-saaliheen ( In Your name, my Lord, I lie
    down, and in Your name I rise. If You should take my soul then have mercy on it, and if
    You should return my soul then protect it as You protect Your righteous slaves).
    When the Muslim wakes up, he should say, Al-hamdu Lillaah alladhi aafaani
    fi jasadi wa radda alayya roohi wa adhina li bi dhikrihi (Praise be to Allaah
    Who has restored to me my health and returned my soul and has allowed me to remember Him
    ). (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 3323 He said, a hasan hadeeth).
