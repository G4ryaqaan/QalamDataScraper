39730,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39730,She performed ‘Umrah a number of times but she did not cut her hair; what is the ruling?,"What is the ruling on a woman who performed ‘Umrah one or more times, but she did not cut her hair? After that she did more than one ‘Umrah and did cut her hair. Does she have to do anything with regard to what happened in the past?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.According to the scholars, whoever fails to do one of the obligatory duties of Hajj or ‘Umrah, such as shaving the head or cutting the hair, has to offer a compensatory sacrifice, to be slaughtered in Makkah and its meat distributed to the poor. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was asked about a person who did ‘Umrah but did not shave his head or cut his hair because he forgot or was unaware of the ruling. What is the ruling on his ‘Umrah? 
He replied: 
His ‘Umrah is valid even if he did not shave his head or cut his hair, because shaving the head or cutting the hair is not one of the pillars (essential parts) of ‘Umrah, rather it is one of the duties. If a person omits it by mistake because he forgot, then he should shave his head when he remembers, unless the time has passed, in which case he should offer a compensatory sacrifice in Makkah and give the meat in charity to the poor. And there is no sin on him in this case, so long as he did that out of forgetfulness or ignorance. 
Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 22/466, 1000 
He was also asked about a man who exited ihraam following ‘Umrah, after performing tawaaf and saa’i, and he did not cut his hair, then he entered ihraam for Hajj. What should he do? 
He replied: 
It seems that he continued in the state of tamattu’, but he has to offer compensation for not shaving his head or cutting his hair, based on the well-known view among the fuqaha’ that the one who omits an obligatory duty has to offer a fidyah (ransom). If he is well off, then he has to offer a compensatory sacrifice in Makkah and distribute all its meat to the poor. If he cannot afford it, then he does not have to do anything. With regard to his Hajj, it is tamattu’ because this was his intention.

39734,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39734,He committed zina during the day in Ramadan. What should he do?,What should he do? What is the ruling on his fasting? How should he make it up? All of this has to do with a young man who committed zina during the day in Ramadan. What should he do after repenting in the manner advised in books etc?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Intercourse during the day in Ramadan is one of the most serious of the things that break the fast. Whoever breaks his fast by having intercourse has committed a sin. He has to refrain from eating etc for the rest of that day, and he has to make it up and offer the burdensome expiation. The evidence for that is the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: a man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, “O Messenger of Allah, I am doomed!” He said: “What is the matter with you?” He said, “I had intercourse with my wife when I was fasting.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do you have a slave whom you can set free?” He said, “No.” He said: “Can you fast for two consecutive months?” He said, “No.” He said, “Can you afford to feed sixty poor persons?” He said, “No.” … Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1936; Muslim, 1111. 
We have already discussed that in detail in questions no. 38023, 22938, 1672 
This applies if he had intercourse with his wife – so how about one who transgressed the sanctity of this month by committing zina – Allah forbid. 
The one who does that violates two sacred things: the sanctity of the month and the sanctity of a forbidden relationship. And Allah is the One Whose help we seek. 
This young man has to repent mightily to Allah, and do good deeds, and do a great deal of righteous deeds, and keep company with righteous people. He should strive to keep himself chaste by getting married if he can afford it, or by fasting, for that will help him to be chaste and to avoid haraam actions. 
What he should do now is to repent from that evil action, make up that day, and offer the burdensome expiation mentioned in the hadeeth quoted above. We ask Allah to forgive him and us, and to accept his repentance and ours. Ameen.",Islam Q&A
39736,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39736,What is meant by the devils being chained up in Ramadan?,What do you say about the devils being chained up in Ramadan?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Al-Bukhaari (1899) and Muslim (1079) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When Ramadan comes, the gates of Paradise are opened, the gates of Hell are closed, and the devils are chained up.” 
The scholars differed as to the meaning of the devils being chained up in Ramadan. 
Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said, quoting al-Haleemi: It may be interpreted at meaning that the devils are not able to tempt the Muslims as they are at other times because they are busy with the fast which controls their desires, and with reading Quran and dhikr (remembrance of Allah). Another scholar – someone other than al-Haleemi – said that what is meant by the devils is some of them, namely the maarids (strong devils), who are chained up. 
‘Iyaad said: it may be interpreted in a literal sense, and that is as a sign to the angels that the month has begun, and in veneration of its sanctity, and so as to prevent the devils from harming the Muslims. And it may be interpreted as referring to the great amount of reward and forgiveness, and that the devils tempt people less, so it is as if they are chained up. This second interpretation is supported by the fact that according to a report narrated by Yoonus from Ibn Shihaab which is recorded by Muslim it says “the gates of mercy are opened”. The chaining up of the devils may also be understood as a metaphor for them being unable to tempt people and make their whims and desires attractive to them. Al-Zayn ibn al-Muneer said: The first view is most likely to be correct, and there is no need to try to understand it in anything other than the literal sense.""(Fath al-Bari, 4/114). 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) “and the devils are chained up,” – yet we still see people suffering from epilepsy during the day in Ramadan, so how can the devils be chained up when some people are suffering epileptic fits? 
He replied: In some versions of the hadith it says “and the strong devils (maarids) are chained up” – this is narrated by al-Nasaa’i. This hadith is speaking of matters of the unseen, so we have to accept it and not discuss it any further. This is safer for a person’s religious commitment. Hence when ‘Abd-Allah, the son of Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal said to his father, “Some people suffer epileptics fits during the day in Ramadan,” the Imam said: “This is what the hadith says and we do not discuss this.” 
Moreover it seems that what is meant by their being chained up is that they are prevented from tempting people, based on the fact that there is a great deal of goodness and many people turn to Allah during Ramadan. 
Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 20. 
Based on this, the chaining up of the devils is something that happens in a real sense, about which Allah knows best. This does not mean that evil things do not happen or that people do not commit sin. And Allah knows best.

Is it permissible to make up the missed fasts only, or should I fast and also offer expiation? If expiation is required then how much is it?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for a person to delay making up the missed Ramadan fasts that he owed until the next Ramadan begins with no excuse. If he does that then he has committed a sin. The scholars differed as to whether he has to offer expiation as well as make them up because of this delay or not. 
Our advice to the sister who asked this question is to strive to make up the fasts that she owes with no delay, so that she does not burden herself and it then becomes difficult for her to make them up. 
With regard to the issue of expiation, we have already discussed the scholarly differences of opinion concerning this matter in questions no 26865 and 21710. 
From the two questions mentioned above, you may know that you do not have to offer expiation as well as making up the fasts, according to the more correct view, rather what you have to do is to repent to Allah and resolve not to do such a thing again. If you offer expiation as well as making up the missed fasts in order to be on the safe side, there is nothing wrong with that. The expiation consists of feeding one poor person for each day.

39744,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39744,"Ruling on selling TVs, VCRs and Playstation","I have a store selling electrical equipment. Is it permissible for me to sell TVs, VCRs and Playstations and the disks that go in them, knowing that I do not know for what purpose these items will be used?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.These items – TVs, VCRs, etc – are things that may be used for good and bad purposes, but nowadays they are usually used for evil purposes, such as viewing naked women, and listening to idle entertainment such as music, etc. In this case a person should act according to what he thinks is most likely the case. 
It is not permissible to sell them to anyone except one who you think will most likely use it for permissible purposes. 
As for one whom you know or think it most likely will use it for haram purposes, it is not permissible for you to sell it to him, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Help you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression” [Al-Maa’idah 5:2]
It says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah: “Everything that will be used in a haram manner, or which one thinks will most likely be used in a haram manner, it is haram to manufacture it, import it, sell it, and distribute it among the Muslims.”(Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 13/109)
The Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas was also asked the following question: 
I work as an electronic engineer, and part of my work involves fixing radios, TVs, VCRs and similar equipment. I hope you can advise me as to whether I should continue in this work, noting that if I give up this work I will miss out on a lot of experience and lose my profession for which I have studied all my life, and leaving it might cause me harm.  
They replied: 
The shar’i evidence from the Quran and Sunnah indicates that the Muslim must seek provision from halal sources. So you should look for work where your income will be halal. Some of the income from the work that you mention is not halal, because these machines are usually used for haram purposes.(Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 14/420). 
With regard to the Playstation and its disks, they come under the same ruling as mentioned above. It is permissible to sell them to those whom you think will most likely use them for permissible purposes, and it is haram to sell them to those whom you think will most likely use them for haram purposes. 
Many people nowadays use them for haram purposes, and instead of leisure being something to which a person turns occasionally, leisure has become the main thing for many people, and they spend a lot of their time, money and energy on playing these kinds of games, and going to clubs and swimming pools, travelling, sitting with friends, going on trips, etc. 
Many of those who use the Playstation and similar games miss prayers because of them, and get distracted from many of their religious and worldly interests, which makes us certain that such things are forbidden. 
But for those who can put things in their proper place, and play these games for a little while as a form of leisure, but do not miss any of their duties or worldly or religious interests because of them, whilst ensuring that the games they play are free of evils such as music and pictures of naked women, etc, then there is no sin in that, in sha Allah. 
What matters is that the Muslim should strive to earn halal money in which there is nothing dubious. He should remember the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Every body that is nourished from haram sources, the Fire is more fitting for it.” Narrated by al-Tabaraani and classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 4519.

Then I heard something to the contrary. What is the ruling on this issue? Do I have to do anything?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Making up missed Ramadaan fasts is obligatory, and it is not permissible for a person to break such a fast unless there is a legitimate shar’i reason. If a person starts to make up a missed fast, then he must complete it. He is not like one who is observing a naafil fast, because in that case he is in charge of the matter; if he wishes he may break his fast and if he wishes he may continue it. 
See question no. 49985. 
It was narrated that Umm Hani’ (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: “O Messenger of Allaah, I broke my fast when I was fasting.” He said to her: “Were you making up anything?” She said: No.” He said: “Then it does not matter if you were observing a voluntary fast.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2456. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani. This indicates that it would matter if she broke her fast when observing an obligatory fast. What is meant by “it would matter” here is that it would be a sin. 
With regard to what happened between you, the expiation for intercourse is only required in the case of intercourse during the day in Ramadaan itself. Based on this you do not have to do anything, and all she is required to do is to make that day up again. And you (both) have to repent to Allaah and resolve not to do such a thing again. 
Ibn Rushd said: The majority are agreed that no expiation is required for deliberately breaking a fast observed to make up a missed Ramadaan fast, because it does not come under the same category with regard to sanctity of time, i.e., Ramadaan.

39768,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39768,A religious young man is suffering with the secret habit (masturbation) because of watching TV,"I am suffering with the secret habit and the problem is that I am religiously committed, and I am trying to control myself and not watch TV. But when this desire comes I lose my resolve, and I watch TV until I do it. What is the solution to this problem? 

I am being honest with you. When I feel desire, my nafs (self) makes me watch TV, so I sit down and continue watching until I do it where I am sitting. What is the solution?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    The secret habit is haraam, as we have explained in the 
    answer to question no. 329, q.v. 

    You have to repent from this action by giving it up, and 
    regretting what you have done, and resolving not to go back to it. 

    Secondly: 

    The way to treat this bad habit is to understand the 
    devastating damage that it causes and to follow the advice given by 
    sharee’ah. 

    With regard to the harm caused by this secret habit, 
    researchers are agreed that it is harmful, and that it increases and gets 
    worse the more a person – whether male or female – does it. Researchers have 
    written a great deal about the psychological, intellectual and nervous 
    damage it causes, let alone the physical damage to the reproductive system, 
    the digestive system, the heart, the faculties and the body in general. 
It is a good idea to 
    refer to some of the things that have been written about this habit. 

    Quoting from the book al-‘Aadah al-Sirriyyah ‘inda 
    al-rajul wa’l-mar’ah wa adraaruha (The secret habit among men and women 
    and the harm it causes) by Muhammad Faa’iq al-Jawhari: 

    This is in addition to the negative effects it has in the 
    spiritual realm – which is not mentioned by most researchers – of causing 
    the person to neglect prayers because of the need to repeat ghusl, 
    especially during the winter; and weakness of resolve in resisting the means 
    of immorality and provocation. In addition to that there is the sense of 
    psychological defeat which leads some people to forsake righteous friends, 
    because they feel that they do not deserve to be in their company, in 
    addition to it being one of the means of taking lightly immoral actions such 
    as zina and homosexuality.  

    Thirdly: 

    With regard to shar’i advice, we advise the following: 

    1 – Lower your gaze and avoid looking at haraam things. That 
    includes not looking at women on the TV, for the pictures of women that are 
    shown on the TV are one of the greatest causes of fitnah (temptation) and 
    provocation of desire. Forbidden looks are one of the arrows of the 
    Shaytaan. If you are fulfilling your desire by means of the secret habit 
    now, you will not be able to control this desire and prevent yourself from 
    satisfying it by means of other major sins that are even more serious, such 
    as homosexuality and zina. 

    2 – Avoiding being alone. The wolf only eats the sheep that 
    strays away from the flock, and the Shaytaan gains control over the man who 
    is on his own, but he is further away from two and even further away from 
    three. 

    3 – Fast a great deal. This is the advice of the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to young men who are unable to 
    get married. Fasting is a way of disciplining oneself, lowering the gaze and 
    guarding one's chastity. 

    4 – Making a lot of du’aa’, praying for forgiveness and 
    glorifying Allaah. Whoever keeps himself busy with this, the Shaytaan will 
    have no way to tempt him and lead him astray. 

    5 – Praying sincerely that Allaah will keep you away from 
    haraam things and whatever leads to them. Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “And your Lord said: Invoke Me [i.e. believe in My Oneness 
    (Islamic Monotheism) and ask Me for anything] I will respond to your 
    (invocation)”

    [Ghaafir 40:60]
6 – Keeping company with 
    righteous people. A righteous friend will only show you the way to good. 
    ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “It is enough 
    honour for my brothers that I do not disobey Allaah among them.”

39770,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39770,Ruling on being intimate with a non-mahram woman without intercourse,What is the ruling on being intimate with a non-mahram woman without intercourse in the vagina? Is anal intercourse regarded as sodomy?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly:  
It is by Allah’s wisdom that when He forbids a thing He forbids the things that lead to it, because indulging in things that may lead to haraam may make the heart inclined towards it, in such a way that the individual develops a psychological conflict between falling into this sin or the suffering that results from standing in the middle of the road, so that he is not shunning the haraam thing entirely, with the peace of mind that comes from keeping away from it, nor is he committing the sin and fulfilling the desires of his self that is inclined towards evil. In most cases of this type, the person will fall into major sins that he thought he would never commit, major sins that corrupt his religious and worldly affairs, ruin his life, and destroy the blessing in his wealth and children, as a befitting punishment for his sin, because he moved away from his Lord and transgressed His sacred limits, and did not care that Allaah was watching him and was aware of what he was doing. The wise man is the one who is not careless about things that lead to real disasters that affect his religious commitment, which is a man’s capital and comes before any worldly consideration. 
The one who thinks about this question will realize that it is impossible for a man to reach that level of evil and then be able to control himself and refrain from falling into that great sin, which is as nothing compared to the anger and wrath of Allaah and the corruption that it causes, all just for the sake of the short-lived pleasure that the sinner is trying to achieve, which will be followed by never-ending regret. 
The Muslim has to understand things as they are and what they lead to, and not be tempted by the things that the Shaytaan makes attractive, or be deceived when the Shaytaan tries to make him think of evil actions as insignificant as a trick to make people join his party of losers. He has to fear Allaah his Lord in private and in public, and know that Allaah sees him and knows his intentions and his actions, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allaah knows the fraud of the eyes, and all that the breasts conceal”
[Ghaafir 40:19]
He should remember that what is with Allaah is better and more lasting, and that the Hereafter and its blessings are better for him than this world, and that the reward for being patient in abstaining from evil actions is Paradise as vast as the heavens and the earth, in which there is whatever a person could want of absolute and untainted pleasure. 
For more information on the ruling please see question no. 27259
Secondly: 
Anal intercourse, if done with a man, is homosexuality which is condemned in the Qur’aan and Sunnah. 
It was one of the causes of the destruction of a nation, namely the people of Loot, the Prophet of Allaah. 
With regard to anal intercourse with a woman: if this is with one's wife, it is not permissible, and is known as “lesser sodomy”, so how about if it is with a woman who is not permissible for him? 
(a)What was narrated concerning sodomy:
Ibn Hazam said: 
The action of the people of Loot is a major sin and a forbidden immoral action, like eating pork, dead meat and blood, drinking alcohol, committing adultery, and all other sins. Whoever regards it as permissible or regards any of the things we have mentioned as permissible is a kaafir and a mushrik, whose blood may be shed and whose wealth may be seized. 
Al-Muhalla, 12/389 
Ibn Qudaamah said: 
The scholars are unanimously agreed that sodomy is forbidden. It was condemned by Allaah in His Book, and by the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And (remember) Loot (Lot), when he said to his people: ‘Do you commit the worst sin such as none preceding you has committed in the ‘Aalameen (mankind and jinn)?
Verily, you practise your lusts on men instead of women. Nay, but you are a people transgressing beyond bounds (by committing great sins)’”
[al-A’raaf 7:80]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “May Allaah curse those who do the deed of the people of Loot, may Allaah curse those who do the deed of the people of Loot, may Allaah curse those who do the deed of the people of Loot.” 
Al-Mughni, 9/59 
Ibn al-Qayyim narrated from his shaykh Ibn Taymiyah and from others that there was consensus among the Sahaabah that the one who does the deed of the people of Loot should be put to death, but they differed as to how that should be done. 
Zaad al-Ma’aad, (5/40). For more details on the ruling see also question no. 10050. 
(b)What was narrated concerning anal intercourse with a woman:
Anal intercourse with a woman is a major sin, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed the one who does that. 
Abu Dawood (2162) narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Cursed is the one who has intercourse with his wife in her back passage.” Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. This curse applies to one who has anal intercourse with his wife, so how about if the woman is a stranger (non-mahram) to him? 
Al-Tirmidhi (135) narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever has intercourse with a menstruating woman or with a woman in her back passage, or who goes to a soothsayer, has disbelieved in that which was revealed to Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
If a man and wife agree to anal intercourse and do not stop after being punished (with a ta’zeer punishment), then they are to be separated. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah was asked about a man who has intercourse with his wife in her back passage. 
He replied: 
Having anal intercourse with a woman is haraam, according to the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and this is the view of the majority of earlier and later scholars. Indeed, this is “lesser sodomy”. It was proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah is not too shy to tell the truth. Do not have intercourse with women in their back passages.” And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Your wives are a tilth for you, so go to your tilth, when or how you will”
[al-Baqarah 2:223]
The tilth (harth) is the place from which the child is born [the vagina], because the tilth is the place of planting and sowing. The Jews used to say that if a man had intercourse with his wife from behind, the child would be born with a squint, then Allaah revealed this verse, and Allaah allowed the man to have intercourse with his wife in all positions, so long as it is in the vagina only. Whoever has intercourse with her in her back passage, and she obeys him in that, they should both be punished, and if they do not stop, then they should be separated, as an immoral man and the person with whom he commits immoral actions should be separated, and Allaah knows best. 
Al-Fataawa al-Kubra, 3/104, 105 
With regard to having intercourse with a non-mahram woman in her back passage, the scholars differed as to whether this is zina (fornication) or sodomy. 
See al-Mabsoot, 9/77; al-Faakihah al-Dawaanah, 2/209; Mughni al-Muhtaaj, 5/443; al-Insaaf, 10/177; al-Furoo’, 6/72 
The view favoured by Shaykh al-Sa’di (may Allaah have mercy on him) is that having intercourse with a non-mahram woman in her back passage is considered to be zina (fornication). He said: Zina means having an unlawful sexual relationship in the front passage or the back passage. Manhaj al-Saalikeen, p. 239. 
We ask Allaah to keep us safe from evil and to purify our hearts of evil thoughts, and to help us to be steadfast in adhering to His religion and obeying His commands.

What are the books that you recommend for every Muslim (who is not specialized in the sciences of sharee’ah) to read concerning his ‘aqeedah and his everyday acts of worship and interactions with others?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
Professor Muhammad ‘Ali al-Saabooni is one of the professors in the College of Sharee’ah in Makkah al-Mukarramah. He was active in the fields of Qur’aan sciences and Tafseer (commentary), then he wrote a number of books on Tafseer and Qur’aanic sciences, most of which are summaries of  longer books such as Mukhtasar Tafseer Ibn Katheer, Mukhtasar Tafseer al-Tabari, al-Tibyaan fi ‘Uloom al-Qur’aan, Rawaa’i’ al-Bayaan fi Tafseer Ayaat al-Ahkaam, Qabs min Noor al-Qur’aan, and Safwat al-Tafaaseer, which is the book under discussion here. 
This is a concise tafseer of which its author said: it is comprehensive, based on both narrated reports and rational argument, based on the most authentic well known tafseers such as al-Tabari, al-Kashshaaf, Ibn Katheer, al-Bahr al-Muheet and Rooh al-Ma’aani. It is written in a simple style that is easy to understand, paying attention to literary style and linguistic form. 
He says in the introduction: 
I have called my book Safwat al-Tafaaseer (The Best of Tafseers) because it combines the best of the major detailed tafseers in a brief, organized and clear fashion. 
The book was published in three volumes, in 1400 AH. 
With regard to the ‘aqeedah of the author, his beliefs are Ash’ari, which makes his books and summaries subject to criticism and rejection. This also makes him misquote some hadeeth texts by not quoting them in full, and distort some of his quotations from other scholars, as we shall see below. 
Shaykh Safar al-Hawaali said:  
With regard to al-Saabooni, it does not bother me to say that what he has written about the ‘aqeedah of the salaf and that of the Ash’aris conflicts with the basic principles that every researcher who studies ‘aqeedah should know, and his style is also far removed from the authenticated academic style and from rationality. 
Manhaj al-Ashaa’irah fi’l-‘Aqeedah, p. 2 
He was refuted by many scholars such as Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz, Shaykh al-Albaani, Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan, Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd, Shaykh Muhammad Jameel Zayno and others. 
With regard to his book Safwat al-Tafaaseer, it is one of those books of his which were most emphatically refuted by the scholars. There follows a list of some of those who refuted it, along with the titles of their books: 
1.al-Radd ‘ala Akhta’ Muhammad ‘Ali al-Saabooni fi Kitaabihi Safwat al-Tafaaseer wa Mukhtasar Tafseer Ibn Jareer, by Shaykh Muhammad Jameel Zayno, teacher of Tafseer in Daar al-Hadeeth, Makkah.
2.Tanbeehaat Haammah ‘ala Kitaab Safwat al-Tafaaseer by Shaykh Muhammad Jameel Zayno.
3.Mulaahazaat ‘ala Kitaab Safwat al-Tafaaseer by Shaykh Sa’d Zallaam, Dean of the School of Arabic Language in Egypt.
4.Mulaahazaat ‘ala Safwat al-Tafaaseer by Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Jibreen.
5.Mulaahazaat ‘Aammah ‘ala Kitaab Safwat al-Tafaaseer by Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan.
6.al-Tahzeer min Mukhtasaraat al-Saabooni fi’l-Tafseer by Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd; this is included in his major book al-Rudood. 
These criticisms led the Ministry of Awqaaf in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to ban this book and confiscate it, as stated in the Decree of the Ministry of Hajj and Awqaaf no. 945/2/S, dated 16/4/1408 AH, from the General Headquarters of Awqaaf and Mosques in the Riyaadh area, pertaining to the confiscation of the book Safwat al-Tafaaseer and banning circulation thereof until its errors with regard to ‘aqeedah have been corrected. 
Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd said: 
The title Safwat al-Tafaaseer (“The Best of Tafseers”) is deceiving and confusing. How can it be described as the best when it mixes good and bad, when it mixes the tafseers of the Salafis Ibn Jareer and Ibn Katheer with the tasfeers of the Mu’tazili al-Zamakhshari, the Raafidis al-Radiy and al-Tubrusi, the Ash’ari al-Raazi and the fanatical Ash’ari grave-worshipper al-Saawi and others? Especially when this mixing is done by one who does not know what he is doing and is like one who tries to climb a wall without a ladder. Otherwise scholars may benefit from the prominent mufassireen who do not stray from the path of the salaf, the guidelines of tafseer and the rules of the Arabic language. 
Al-Rudood, p. 311. 
And he said: He is described as ignorant because he classes da’eef (weak) reports as saheeh (sound), and vice versa; he attributes many ahaadeeth to the two Saheehs or the four Sunans etc when they are not to be found in the two Saheehs or in any of those books; he quotes the Israa’eeliyyaat (reports  derived from Jewish sources) as evidence; and he contradicts himself when discussing rulings. 
He is described as betraying the academic trust because he misquotes reports, quoting them only partially; he attributes things to scholars that they did not say; he distorts many texts; and he tries to produce evidence for the views of the khalaf (later scholars) concerning the verses that describe the divine attributes from the books of the salaf. 
Because of his own beliefs, he tries to distort the ‘aqeedah of the salaf in his commentaries on the Tafseers of Ibn Jareer and Ibn Katheer, and even more so in his own book Safwat al-Tafaaseer. His distortion of a number of texts is aimed only at proving his own distorted ‘aqeedah. 
Al-Rudood, p. 313, 314. 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz offered him the following advice: 
We advise you to fear Allaah, and strive to follow the path of the righteous salaf in all your books. We also advise you to study the Qur’aan, the pure Sunnah and the words of the salaf of this ummah a great deal, and to benefit from the writings of Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and his student Ibn al-Qayyim. And we advise you to study the two essays al-Tadmuriyyah and al-Hamawiyyah by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, and al-Sawaa’iq, and Ijtimaa’ al-Juyoosh al-Islamiyyah by Ibn al-Qayyim, and other books of the salaf.

39775,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39775,The ruling on one who continually prays for forgiveness so that he might be blessed with a child,"In Soorat Nooh it speaks of the virtue of praying for forgiveness (istighfaar). What is the correct way of praying for forgiveness? There is an experiment – if we may call it such – where a colleague of mine at work had not been blessed with a child after a year and a half. After that he persisted in praying for forgiveness at all times and in all situations, after giving up unnecessary talk and seeking halaal in all his needs. Within less than a month, praise be to Allah, he had the good news that his wife had become pregnant – may Allah preserve this colleague and his offspring and family.
 Subhaan Allah (glory be to Allah); can this be applied to everyone who seeks wealth and prosperity?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“I said (to them): ‘Ask forgiveness from your Lord, verily, He is Oft‑Forgiving;
11. ‘He will send rain to you in abundance,
12. ‘And give you increase in wealth and children, and bestow on you gardens and bestow on you rivers.’”
[Nooh 71:10-12] 
Al-Qurtubi said: 
The words “I said (to them): ‘Ask forgiveness from your Lord’” mean: ask Him for forgiveness of your previous sins with sincerity of faith.
“verily, He is Oft‑Forgiving” means, He forgives everyone who turns to Him; this encourages us to repent.
“He will send rain to you in abundance” means, He will send a great deal of rain to you.
“And give you increase in wealth and children, and bestow on you gardens and bestow on you rivers”  
Al-Shu’bi said: ‘Umar went out to pray for rain and he did no more than pray for forgiveness until he came back, then it rained. They said: “We did not see you ask for rain.” He said: “I sought rain with the real key by means of which rain is sought.” Then he recited (interpretation of the meaning): “Ask forgiveness from your Lord, verily, He is Oft‑Forgiving; He will send rain to you in abundance.” 
The word translated here as “key” – majaadeeh – refers to the stars which the ancient Arabs claimed brought rain. What ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) meant was to reject this false claim of the Arabs and explain that he had sought rain by the correct means, which is praying for forgiveness, not by means of the stars. 
A man complained to al-Hasan about a drought, and he said to him: “Pray to Allah for forgiveness.” Another man complained to him of poverty and he said to him: “Pray to Allah to forgive you.” Another man said to him: “Pray to Allah to bless me with a child.” He said: “Pray to Allah for forgiveness.” Another complained to him that his garden was dry. He said to him: “Pray to Allah for forgiveness.” We asked him about that and he said: “This is not my personal opinion, for Allah says in Soorat Nooh (interpretation of the meaning): ‘Ask forgiveness from your Lord, verily, He is Oft‑Forgiving; He will send rain to you in abundance. And give you increase in wealth and children, and bestow on you gardens and bestow on you rivers.” 
Tafseer al-Qurtubi, 18/301-302. 
Secondly: 
With regard to the wording of prayers for forgiveness, it is better to use the words narrated in the saheeh Sunnah from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), which he either said himself or enjoined the ummah to say: 
(i)                It was narrated from Shaddaad ibn Aws (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The best prayer for forgiveness is to say: Allahumma anta Rabbiy laa ilaaha illa anta, khalaqtani wa ana ‘abduka wa ana ‘ala ‘ahdika wa wa’dika ma astata’tu, a’oodhu bika min sharri ma sana’tu aboo’u laka bi ni’matika ‘alayya wa aboo’u laka bi dhanbi, faghfir li fa innahu laa yaghfir ul-dhunooba illa anta (O Allah, You are my Lord and I am Your slave, You have created me and I am faithful to my covenant and my promise (to You) as much as I am able. I seek refuge with You from the evil of that which I have done. I acknowledge before You all the blessings You have bestowed upon me and I confess to You my sin. Forgive me for there is no one who forgives sin except You).”  
He said: Whoever says this during the day believing in it with certainty and dies that day before evening comes, will be one of the people of Paradise, and whoever says it at night believing in it with certainty and dies before morning comes will be one of the people of Paradise. Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5947. 
(ii)              It was narrated from Abu Moosa al-Ash’ari that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to recite the following du’aa’: “Rabb ighfir li khati’ati wa jahli wa israafi fi amri kullihi wa ma anta a’lam bihi minni, Allahumma ighfir li khataayaaya wa ‘amdi wa jahli wa hazli wa kulla dhaalika ‘indi, Allahumma ighfir li ma qaddamtu wa ma akhkhartu wa ma asrartu wa ma a’lantu anta al-Muqaddim wa anta al-Mu’akhkhir wa anta ‘ala kulli shay’in qadeer (O Allah, forgive me my mistakes, my ignorance and my transgressing the limits of righteousness in my deeds and whatever You know better than I. O Allah, forgive me the wrongs that I have committed deliberately or mistakenly or jokingly, for all of that is possible in me. O Allah, forgive my past and future sins, what I have done secretly and openly, for You are the One Who brings (some people) forward and puts (others) back, and You are able to do all things).” Narrated by al-Bukhari (6035), Muslim (2719). 
(iii)            It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar said: We used to count that the Messenger of Allah (S) said one hundred times in a gathering: “Rabb ighfir li wa tub ‘alayya innaka anta al-tawwaab ul-raheem (O Allah forgive me and accept my repentance, for You are the Accepter of repentance, the Most Merciful). 
Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3434, where it says al-Tawwaab al-Ghafoor (the Accepter of repentance, the Oft-Forgiving); Abu Dawood, 1516; Ibn Maajah, 3814. 
(iv)            It was narrated from Abu Yasaar that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever says Astaghfir Allah al-‘Azeem alladhi laa ilaaha illa huwa al-Hayyu al-Qayyoom wa atoobu ilayhi (I ask forgiveness of Allah the Almighty, besides Whom there is no god, the Ever-Living, the Eternal, and I repent to Him), will be forgiven even if his sin is fleeing from the battlefield [a major sin].” 
Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3577; Abu Dawood, 1517. 
(v)              It was narrated from Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Teach me a du’aa’ which I may recite in my prayer.” He said: “Say: Allahumma inni zalamtu nafsi zulman katheeran wa laa yaghfir ul-dhunooba illa anta faghfir li maghfiratan min ‘indaka warhamni innaka anta al-Ghafoor al-Raheem (O Allah, I have wronged myself greatly and no one forgives sins but You, so grant me forgiveness from You and have mercy on me, for You are the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful).”

39795,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39795,"She betrayed her husband and put a spell on him, and he turned against his family","My son married a bad woman who put a spell on him, as a result of which he turned against his whole family, and he would not refuse any demand she made, no matter what it was. 

The Society for Enjoining the Good caught her with her lover, and it was proven that she had committed this crime. Yet despite that my son refused to divorce her and he always defends her. 

We entered her house and found some weird things. We found a shoe placed on top of the Book of Allaah on top of the wardrobe (we seek refuge with Allaah), and we found other things. She has female servants from a land where they are known for witchcraft. 

This made us certain that she had bewitched my son, so we went to one of the shaykhs to recite Qur’aan over him, and the signs of having been bewitched were found on him. 

Now he is refusing any treatment and he does not believe us when we tell him that he has been bewitched. What should we do? Should we go to a practitioner of witchcraft to undo the spell? 

His father has died and he is now demanding that we give him his share of his father’s estate. Should we give him the money when he is bewitched and will waste the money? This woman took all his money and spent it on witchcraft and trickery. And he has children who are in need of this money.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    No doubt what has happened to your son is a trial for you, 
    and we ask Allaah to grant you patience and make you steadfast in adhering 
    to His religion; and we ask Him to heal your son. It is obvious that he has 
    fallen prey to the effects of witchcraft so you should not blame him for the 
    way in which he treats you. No rational person would be content to learn of 
    any of the things that his wife has done and remain silent about them. But 
    it seems that the witchcraft has affected him greatly, to such as extent 
    that he agrees with her and has turned against you. 

    In the answer to question no.
    11290 we have already explained 
    that it is haraam to treat witchcraft by means of witchcraft. In that answer 
    and in the answer to question no. 12918
    we have explained the shar’i method of treating witchcraft. 

    You can treat your son by reciting Qur’aan over water and 
    giving it to him to drink without his knowledge. And you have to constantly 
    make du’aa’ whilst using this remedy, that Allaah may relieve him of this 
    distress and harm. 

    Secondly: 

    Whether your son should be given his share of the inheritance 
    depends on whether he will dispose of the money properly. If the money will 
    fall into his hands or his wife’s hands and they will never dispose of it 
    properly, then it is not permissible for you to let him have the money; you 
    should keep it with you and spend on him and his children from it. This is a 
    trust which has been given to you, and you should not be careless about it. 

    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And give not unto 
    the foolish your property which Allaah has made a means of support for you, 
    but feed and clothe them therewith, and speak to them words of kindness and 
    justice.

    6. And try orphans (as regards their intelligence) until 
    they reach the age of marriage; if then you find sound judgement in them, 
    release their property to them, but consume it not wastefully and hastily 
    fearing that they should grow up, and whoever (amongst guardians) is rich, 
    he should take no wages, but if he is poor, let him have for himself what is 
    just and reasonable (according to his labour). And when you release their 
    property to them, take witness in their presence; and Allaah is 
    All‑Sufficient in taking account”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:5, 6]

    Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Sa’di said:

    Sufaha’ [translated here as “the 
    foolish”] is the plural of safeeh, which refers to one who is unable 
    to dispose of money properly, either because he has no powers of reasoning, 
    such as one who is insane or feeble-minded, etc, or because he is lacking in 
    wisdom, such as a child and one who is immature. Allaah has forbidden 
    guardians to give such people their wealth, for fear that they will destroy 
    it and waste it, and because Allaah has made wealth means of support for His 
    slaves, in their religious and worldly interests. These people will not look 
    after it properly and guard it, so Allaah has commanded their guardians not 
    to give it to them, rather they should provide for them from it, clothing 
    them and spending on them from it, and taking care of their religious and 
    worldly needs. And they should speak to them words of kindness and justice, 
    by promising them, when they ask for it, that they will give it to them 
    after they become mature and so on. They should speak to them kindly to 
    soften their hearts. The fact that Allaah gives control of the wealth to the 
    guardians indicates that they are obliged to take care of the wealth of the 
    foolish just as well as they would take care of their own wealth, guarding 
    it, disposing of it properly and not exposing it to danger. 

    This verse indicates that the cost of spending on the insane, 
    the young and the foolish should come from their own wealth, if they have 
    wealth, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “but feed 
    and clothe them therewith” (v. 5).

    Tafseer al-Sa’di. 

    This matter should be referred to the shar’i court and proof 
    should be established that this son cannot handle his money properly, so 
    that the court will prevent him from accessing it and will appoint a 
    guardian to look after his money.

39799,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39799,He owns an café in which men and women mix,"A man owns a high-quality café which has a mixed clientele of men and women. He feels uneasy because of this mixing and fears that the income from this café may come under the heading of things which are forbidden or are doubtful and therefore disallowed in sharee’ah, even though he has told his employees not to sell anything that is forbidden in sharee’ah, such as cigarettes, and he has forbidden his customers to do anything that goes against Islamic etiquette. We would like you to please shed some light on this issue by quoting some verses of Qur’aan and ahaadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), so that we may find some peace of mind and avoid falling into sin, and we may meet our Lord when He is pleased with us. We hope that the answer will be detailed.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The owner of this café has done well by refusing to sell 
    forbidden substances in his café, such as refusing to sell cigarettes and 
    refusing to allow people to do things that go against Islamic etiquette. May 
    Allaah reward him with good. 

    But it remains for him to forbid mixing, because of the evil 
    and temptation that it involves. The Qur’aan and Sunnah indicate that mixing 
    is haraam. For example: 

    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And when you ask (his wives) for anything you want, ask 
    them from behind a screen, that is purer for your hearts and for their 
    hearts”

    [al-Ahzaab 33:53]

    Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, commenting 
    on this verse: i.e., just as it is forbidden for you to enter upon them, it 
    is also forbidden for you to look at them at all; even if one of you has a 
    need to ask them for anything, he should not look at them or ask of them 
    except from behind a screen. 

    Al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: This verse 
    indicates that Allaah has given permission to ask of them from behind a 
    screen in the case of necessity, or when consulting them about some matter. 
    This meaning includes all women, because the basic principle of sharee’ah is 
    that the whole of a woman is ‘awrah. 

    And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “O wives of the Prophet! You are not like any other women. 
    If you keep your duty (to Allaah), then be not soft in speech, lest he in 
    whose heart is a disease (of hypocrisy, or evil desire for adultery) should 
    be moved with desire, but speak in an honourable manner”

    [al-Ahzaab 33:32]

    If there is this warning against being soft of speech lest 
    the one in whose heart is a disease be moved with desire, then what about 
    men sitting with women who are clothed yet naked, who go astray and lead 
    others astray, chatting and laughing together, and looking at one another? 
    What fitnah can be greater than that? What heart can remain free of sickness 
    when this is the case? 

    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    took care to prevent men mixing with women even in the dearest spots on 
    earth to Allaah, namely the mosques, when he separated the rows of men and 
    women, and he stayed for a while after saying the salaam so that the women 
    could depart, and he designated a door of the mosque specifically for women. 
    The evidence for that is as flows: 

    1 – It was narrated that Umm Salamah (may Allaah be pleased 
    with her) said: When the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) had said the salaam, the women would get up and leave 
    when they had said the salaam, and he would stay for a while before getting 
    up to leave. Ibn Shihaab said: I think – and Allaah knows best – that he 
    stayed a while so that the women could disperse before the men got up to 
    leave. Narrated by al-Bukhaari, no. 793. 

    2 – It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased 
    with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) said: “Why don’t we leave this door for the women?” Naafi’ 
    said: Ibn ‘Umar never entered through that door until he died. Narrated by 
    Abu Dawood, 462; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 

    3 – It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased 
    with him) said: The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said: “The best rows for men are the first ones and the worst are the last, 
    and the best rows for women are the last ones and the worst are the first.” 
    Narrated by Muslim, 664. 

    This is among the greatest evidence that Islam forbids 
    mixing. The further away the men are from the women’s rows the better, and 
    the further away the women are from the men’s rows the better. 

    If these precautions are to be taken in the mosque which is a 
    pure place of worship, then taking them in other places is undoubtedly more 
    important. 

    4 – It was narrated from Abu Usayd al-Ansaari that he heard 
    the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    say, when he was outside the mosque and the men were mixing with the women 
    in the road. The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said to the women: “Move aside, for you have no right to walk in 
    the middle of the road; you should walk at the sides of the road.” Then a 
    woman would walk so close to the walls that her garment would catch on the 
    wall because she walked so close to it.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 5272; 
    classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 

    For more details on the dangers of mixing, please see the 
    answer to question no. 1200. 

    Since mixing is haraam, the owner of this café is committing 
    sin by allowing it and refraining from denouncing it, and by helping these 
    people to commit sin by providing a place for them where they can disobey 
    Allaah. 

    What he has to do is to fear Allaah and not help to spread 
    evil and corruption among the believers. He should be keen to make his food 
    good (i.e., from halaal sources), for “every body that is nourished on 
    haraam, the Fire is more befitting for it,” as the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said. Narrated by al-Tabaraani and Abu 
    Na’eem from Abu Bakr; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 
    no. 4519. 

    Another version was narrated from Ka’b ibn ‘Ajrah: “No flesh 
    grows that is nourished by haraam but the Fire is more befitting for it.”  

    If he can prevent mixing, then this is what he must do, or 
    else he can restrict the café to men only. Otherwise he should look for 
    other, permissible work. Whoever gives up a thing for the sake of Allaah, 
    Allaah will compensate him with something better than it. 

    “And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He 
    will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty).

    3. And He will provide him from (sources) he never could 
    imagine”
