7103,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7103,Does Eating Camel Meat Break Your Wudu?,Does by eating camels meat breaks ablution( wudu ).,,,"Praise be to Allah.The correct view is that the one who eats the meat of a camel old or young, male or female, cooked or raw has to do wudu. There are several reports which serve as evidence (daleel) for this:


The hadith of Jaabir: the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was asked, Should I do wudu after eating camel meat? He said, Yes. The person said: Should I do wudu after eating mutton? He said, If you wish.


(Narrated by Muslim, 360).
The hadith of al-Baraa: the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was asked about eating camel meat. He said, Do wudu after eating it. He was asked about mutton, and he said, Do not do wudu.
(Narrated by Abu Dawood, 184; al-Tirmidhi, 81. Classed as saheeh by Imaam Ahmad and Ishaaq ibn Raahawayh).
The view of those who do not regard it as obligatory to do wudu after eating camel meat is based on several points, such as:


This ruling is mansookh (abrogated). Their evidence (daleel) is:


The hadith of Jaabir; the last of the two commands from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was that there was no need to do wudu after eating food that had been touched by fire.
(Narrated by Abu Dawood, 192; al-Nisaai, 185).
But this does not refute the specific meaning of the hadith quoted above from Saheeh Muslim.
Moreover, there is no evidence here of anything being abrogated, because they asked whether they should do wudu after eating mutton, and he said, If you wish.
If this hadith were abrogated, the ruling on mutton would also be abrogated. The fact that he said, If you wish indicates that these ahaadeeth came after the hadith of Jaabir.
In cases of abrogation there must be evidence that what is being abrogated came first chronologically, and there is no such evidence here.
Moreover, the hadith of abrogation is general in meaning, but this hadith (about camel meat) is more specific, and thus excludes (camel meat) from the general ruling.
The fact that he also asked about mutton makes it clear that the issue here is not whether the meat has been touched by fire; if that were the case then camel meat and mutton would be regarded in the same way.
(B) They also take their evidence from the hadith, wudu has to do with what comes out, not what goes in.
Response:
This hadith was narrated and classed as daeef (weak) by al-Bayhaqi (1/116) and al-Daaraqutni (p. 55). It a weak hadith with three faults (ilal); for more information see al-Silsilah al-Daeefah, 959.
Even if it were saheeh for the sake of argument it is general in meaning, and the hadith which says that wudu is obligatory (after eating camel meat) is specific.
(C) Some of them said that what is meant by the phrase do wudu [perform ablution] after eating it is to wash the hands and mouth, because camel meat has an unpleasant odour and is very greasy, unlike mutton!
Response:
This is unlikely, because the apparent meaning here is wudu as prescribed in shareeah, not ablutions in a linguistic sense (i.e., merely washing one's hands and mouth). It is obligatory to interpret the terminology of shareeah in accordance with the meanings of shareeah.
(D) Some of them take as evidence a story that has no basis; the story in question may be summed up as follows:
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was addressing the people one day, and one of them emitted an odour (i.e., passed wind), but he felt too shy to get up from among the people. He had also eaten camel meat, so the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, covering for him, Whoever has eaten camel meat, let him do wudu. So a group of people who had eaten camel meat got up and went and did wudu.
Response:
Shaykh al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
This story has no basis anywhere in the books of Sunnah or elsewhere in the books of Fiqh and Tafseer, as far as I know.
(al-Silsilah al-Daeefah, 3/268).
The correct view regarding this matter is that the ruling on doing wudu after eating anything that has been touched by fire has been abrogated, but it is obligatory to do wudu after eating camel meat.
Al-Nawawi said:
Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Ishaaq ibn Raahawayh, Yahyaa ibn Yahyaa, Abu Bakr ibn al-Mundhir and Ibn Khuzaymah thought that it (eating camel meat) breaks wudu; this was also the view favoured by al-Haafiz Abu Bakr al-Bayhaqi. It was reported from the scholars of hadith and from a group of the Sahaabah.
They took as evidence the hadith of Jaabir ibn Samurah which was narrated by Muslim. Ahmad ibn Hanbal and Ishaaq ibn Raahawayh said: It has been reported from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in these two saheeh hadiths, the hadith of Jaabir and the hadith of al-Baraa. This view has stronger evidence even though the majority follow the opposite.
The majority responded to this with the hadith of Jaabir: the last of the two commands from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was that there was no need to do wudu after eating meat that had been touched by fire. But this hadith is general, whereas the hadith about doing wudu after eating camel meat is specific, and a specific ruling takes precedence over a general one.
(Sharh Muslim, 4/49).
Among modern scholars, Shaykh Abd al-Azeez ibn Baz, Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen and Shaykh al-Albani also said this.

Points to consider when naming a child in Islam","Praise be to Allah.Importance of giving names in Islam
No doubt the matter of giving names is one of the most important issues in people’s lives. A person’s name is a title which says something about him, and is essential for communicating with him.
It is an adornment and symbol for the person, by which he is called in this world and in the Hereafter. It is indicative of the religion to which he belongs, and makes him feel that he is one of the followers of that religion. It gives an impression of him to other people, and in their view it is like a garment – if it is too long or too short, it does not look right.
How to name a child in Islam
The basic principle concerning names is that they are permissible, but there are some matters which are prohibited according to the Shari`ah and should be avoided when choosing names. These include the following:

Enslavement to or worship of anything other than Allah, including prophets and angels. It is not permissible to be enslaved to or to worship anyone or anything other than Allah at all. Among the names which express enslavement to or worship of anything other than Allah are ‘Abd al-Rasul (“slave of the Messenger”), ‘Abd al-Nabi (“slave of the Prophet”) and ‘Abd al-Amier (slave of the prince) and other names which imply worship of or submission to anything other than Allah. The person who has a name like this must change it. The great Sahabi ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn ‘Awf (may Allah be pleased with him) said: My name was ‘Abd ‘Amr – or according to one report, ‘Abd al-Ka’bah – and when I became Muslim, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) called me ‘Abd al-Rahman. (Narrated by al-Hakim, 3/306. Al-Dhahabi agreed with him)
Names of Allah which are befitting only for Him , may He be glorified, such as al-Khaliq (the Creator), al-Raziq (the Provider), al-Rabb (the Lord), al-Rahman (the Most Merciful), etc., which are names that befit only Allah; names which describe attributes which are true only of Allah, such as Malik al-Muluk (King of kings), al-Qahir (the Subduer), etc. It is haram to call people by these names, and they must be changed. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Do you know of any who is similar to Him?” [Maryam 19:65].
Names that belong exclusively to the disbelievers and are not used by anyone else, such as ‘Abd al-Masih (“slave of the Messiah”), Butrous (Peter), Jurjus (George), and other names which denote religions of disbelief.
Names of idols and false gods which are worshipped instead of Allah, such as naming someone after a devil and so on. 

It is not permissible to call people after the names referred to above; indeed, doing so is haram and anyone who has such a name is obliged to change it.
Disliked names in Islam 

It is makruh (disliked) to use names which have off-putting meanings, either because the meaning is ugly or because it will provoke others to make fun of the person. Such names also go against the teaching of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who commanded us to give beautiful names. Examples of such (objectionable) names include Harb (“war”), Rashash (sprinkles or drizzle), and Hiyam – which is the name of a disease suffered by camels – and other names which have ugly or unpleasant meanings.
It is makruh to use names which have alluring or provocative meanings. This happens a lot when it comes to naming girls, where some names are given which have sexual or provocative meanings.
It is makruh to deliberately name someone after immoral people such as singers and actors/actresses, etc. If they have good names, it is permissible to use those names, but it must be because of the meaning of the name and not because of the desire to imitate those people.
It is makruh to give names which have meanings that refer to sin, such as Sariq (“thief”) or Zalim (“wrongdoer”); or to give the names of Pharaohs or sinners, such as Fir’awn (Pharaoh), Haman (the name of Pharaoh’s minister) and Qarun.
It is makruh to use the names of animals which are well-known for their undesirable characteristics, such as al-Himar (donkey), al-Kalb (dog), al-Qird (monkey), etc.
It is makruh to use any name which is added to the words “al-Din” or “al-Islam” (i.e., names which appear in idafah – genitive construction – with these words), such as Nur al-Din (“light of the religion”), Shams al-Din (“sun of the religion”), Nur al-Islam (“light of Islam”), Shams al-Islam (“sun of Islam”), etc., because these names give a person more than he deserves. The scholars of the Salaf disliked being given nicknames of this sort. Imam al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) disliked his nickname of Muhiy al-Din (“reviver of the religion”); Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) also disliked his nickname of Taqiy al-Din (“piety of the religion”), and he used to say, “But my family gave me this nickname and it became well-known.”
It is makruh to add any word to the name of Allah except the word ‘Abd (slave), as in ‘Abd-Allah (‘Abdullah). Examples of this include Hasab-Allah, Rahmat-Allah (the mercy of Allah), etc. It is similarly makruh to add words to the word al-Rasul (the Messenger).
It is makruh to use the names of angels, or to call people after the names of surahs in the Quran, such as Ta-Ha, Ya-Sin, etc. These names are al-Huruf al-Muqatta’ah (letters which appear at the beginning of some surahs; their meaning is known only to Allah – Translator), they are not names of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). See Tuhfat al-Mawdud by Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him), p 109.

These names are makruh, and it is makruh to give them to anyone. But if a person has been given such a name by his family, and he is grown up and it is difficult for him to change it, he does not have to do so.
Categories of good names
There are four categories of good names:

The first (best) category is the names ‘Abd-Allah and ‘Abd al-Rahman. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The most beloved of names to Allah are ‘Abd-Allah and ‘Abd al-Rahman.” (Narrated by Muslim in his Sahih, 1398).
The second category is all the names which express enslavement to and worship of Allah, such as ‘Abd al-Aziz, ‘Abd al-Rahim, ‘Abd al-Malik, ‘Abd al-Ilah, ‘Abd al-Salam, etc.
The third category is the names of Prophets and Messengers – may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon them. Undoubtedly the best and greatest of them is our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him); the name Ahmad is also one of his names. Next come the names of the “messengers of strong will” [cf. Al-Ahqaf 46:35], namely Ibrahim, Musa, ‘Isa and Nuh (may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon them), then the rest of the prophets - may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon them.
The fourth category is the names of righteous slaves of Allah, above all the Companions of our noble Prophet. It is mustahabb to use their names, following their example and hoping to reach a higher status.
The fifth category is any other good name which has a proper and pleasant meaning.

Points to consider when naming a child in Islam
It is good to pay attention to a number of matters when giving names to our children, including the following:

Recognizing the fact that this name will stay with the person for his entire lifetime, and it could cause some embarrassment or problems for him which in turn could make him feel badly towards his father, mother or whoever gave him this name.
When looking at names in order to choose one, we should look at it from a number of angles. We should look at the name itself, and also think of how it will sound when this person is a child, a youth, an adult, an old man and a father, and how it will suit his father to be called “Abu” (Father of) So and So, and how it will suit his son to be called Son and so son of So and So, etc.
Choosing the name is the right of the father, because he is the one after whom the child will be named (son of, or daughter of…). But it is mustahabb for the father to involve the mother in the decision and to ask for her opinion as to whether she thinks the name is good, so that she will feel happy.
The child must be named after his father even if the father is deceased or divorced, etc., even if he does not take care of the child or see him at all. It is utterly haram to name a child after anyone other than his father, except in one case, which is when the child is born as the result of adultery (Allah forbid). In this case the child should be named after his mother and it is not permissible to name him after his father.

7181,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7181,"What is meant by
    perfection in the hadeeth “no women attained perfection apart from four”?","Could you provide me with more
      information on the Hadith below. Jazka'Allah Khair 
      Narrated Abu Musa Al-Ash'ari (R.A.A): Allah's Messanger (S.A.W) said, ""Many amongst
      men attained perfection but amongst women none attained the perfection except Maryam
      (Mary), the daughter of 'Imran, and Asiya, the wife of Fir'aun (Pharaoh). And the
      superiority of Aishah to other women is like the superiority of Tharid (i.e., and Arabic
      dish) to other meals."" Sahih Al-Bukhari- Volume 5 (Book 62)",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
The scholars differed as to the meaning of the perfection of 
  women. Some said, it refers to Prophethood.
Ibn Hajar said in al-Fath:
 it is as if he said: No women attained 
  Prophethood except for So and so and So and so. (al-Fath, 
  6/447).
This view is mistaken!
The refutation of this idea is as follows:
Some reports also add  and Khadeejah 
  bint Khuwaylid and Faatimah bint Muhammad. (Narrated by at-Tabaraani). 
  We know for sure that Khadeejah and Faatimah were not Prophets, but they are 
  among the women who attained perfection. So what is meant by women who 
  attained perfection is the perfection of close friendship with Allaah 
  (wilaayah, the status of a wali), and not the perfection of Prophethood.
Al-Nawawi said:
Al-Qaadi said: this hadeeth is used as evidence by those who 
  say that a woman could be a Prophet and that Aasiyah and Maryam were Prophets!
But the majority say that they were not Prophets; rather, they 
  were Siddeeqahs [siddeeq: one who speaks or testifies to the truth] 
  and waliyyahs (close friends of Allaah) from among the awliyaa 
  of Allaah.
The word perfection is used to describe something 
  that is the best, the ultimate in its class.
What is meant here is that they achieved the highest degree 
  of virtue, righteousness and taqwaa.
And Allaah knows best. (Sharh Muslim, 
  15/198, 199).
Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah] said:
Al-Qaadi Abu Bakr, al-Qaadi Abu Yalaa, Abul-Maaali 
  and others mentioned that there was scholarly consensus that there could be 
  no female Prophet. The Quraan and the Sunnah do not indicate that, as 
  it says in the aayaat (interpretation of the meanings):
And We sent not before you (as Messengers) any but men 
  unto whom We revealed, from among the people of townships [Yoosuf 12:109]
The Messiah [Eesaa (Jesus)], son of Maryam (Mary), 
  was no more than a Messenger; many were the Messengers that passed away before 
  him. His mother [Maryam (Mary)] was a Siddeeqah [i.e. she believed in the Words 
  of Allaah and His Books [al-Maaidah 5:75]
Here it is mentioned that the highest degree his mother reached 
  was that of siddeeqah.
(Majmoo al-Fataawaa, 4/396).
Secondly: the hadeeth Faatimah is the 
  leader of the women of the people of Paradise except for Maryam bint Imraan. 
  (Narrated by Ahmad, 11347. Its isnaad was classed as hasan by al-Haafiz 
  Ibn Hajar in al-Fath, 7/111).
This hadeeth proves that Faatimah is better than Aasiyah. If 
  Aasiyah had been a Prophet, Faatimah would not have been better than her, because 
  Faatimah is not a Prophet. 
Thirdly:
Al-Karmaani said:
The word perfection does not necessarily imply 
  that she was a Prophet, because the word perfection is used to describe anything 
  that is perfect or is the best in its class. So it means that she reached the 
  highest degree in all the virtues that belong to women. (Al-Fath, 6/447). 
  This is the correct understanding of the perfection of women referred to in 
  the hadeeth.
Fourthly:
And the superiority of Aaishah to other women is 
  like the superiority of Thareed to other meals.
Ibn al-Qayyim said:
Thareed is composed of meat and bread. 
  Meat is the best of those foods that are eaten with bread, and bread is the 
  best of foodstuffs. If they are combined, there can be nothing better than that.
 Zaad al-Maaad, 4/271.
Al-Nawawi said:
The ulamaa said: it means that thareed is 
  better than broth, and thareed with meat is better than broth without 
  thareed, and the thareed that has no meat is better than broth. 
  What is meant by better is that it is more nutritious, more filling, easier 
  to digest, more enjoyable and easier to eat; a person may eat his fill of it 
  quickly, and so on. It is better than all kinds of broth and all kinds of food. 
  The superiority of Aaishah over other women is great, as great as 
  the superiority of thareed over other kinds of food. This does not clearly 
  state that she is better than Maryam and Aasiyah; it could be that what is meant 
  is that she is superior to the women of this ummah.
(Sharh Muslim, 15/199).
Ibn al-Qayyim said, discussing the relative merits of Aaishah 
  and Faatimah:
To say that one thing is better than another without discussing 
  it in detail is not right. If by better I mean the one who has more 
  reward from Allaah, this is something that cannot be known except through the 
  text or report (al-nass), because it has to do with the deeds of the 
  heart, not only the deeds of one's external faculties. How often have there 
  been two people, one of whom did more visible deeds, but the other was of a 
  higher status than him in Paradise.
If by better I mean the one who has more knowledge, 
  then undoubtedly Aaishah was more knowledgeable and brought more 
  benefit to the ummah, for she conveyed knowledge to the ummah such as 
  no one else conveyed and the leaders and rank-and-file of the ummah alike need 
  her. 
But if by better I mean of nobler birth and origin, 
  then undoubtedly Faatimah is better, for she is a part of the Prophet  
  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). This is something unique, which 
  she shares only with her sisters.
If I mean leadership, then Faatimah is the leader of the women 
  of this ummah.
When discussing the question of superiority from all aspects 
  and approaches, this is fair and just. 
When most people speak about who is better or superior, they 
  do not discuss the matter in detail or take a balanced approach. This undermines 
  the truth, and if it is compounded by bias or whims, it becomes ignorant and 
  wrongful talk.

      differences arose because of the murder of ‘Uthmaan (may Allaah be
      pleased with him). The Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) accepted
      for their worldly affairs the one whom the Messenger of Allaah had
      accepted for their religious affairs, the one who had acted as the deputy
      of the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
      him) in leading the prayers [when he was unable to do so – i.e., Abu
      Bakr].
With
      regard to what happened at Ghadeer: Ghadeer is the name of a well in a
      place between Makkah and Madeenah which is called Khum. The hadeeth was
      narrated by Imaam Muslim in his Saheeh
      (no. 2408) from Zayd ibn Arqam, who said: “The Messenger of Allaah 
      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stood up and addressed us one
      day at a well called Khum, between Makkah and Madeenah. He praised Allaah
      and exhorted and reminded us. Then he said: ‘I am leaving among you two
      important things: the first of which is the Book of Allaah’ – and he
      urged us to adhere to the Book of Allaah, then he said: ‘And the people
      of my household (ahl bayti).
      I remind you of Allaah with regard to the people of my household, I remind
      you of Allaah with regard to the people of my household, I remind you of
      Allaah with regard to the people of my household.’” Zayd said: his
      wives are among the people of his household, but the people of his
      household who are forbidden to receive sadaqah (charity) after his death
      are the family of ‘Ali, the family of ‘Aqeel, the family of Ja’far
      and the family of ‘Abbaas. All of these are forbidden to receive
      sadaqah.” [abbreviated version].
      
      
      His advice concerning the people of his household has to do with honouring
      and respecting them, and not exposing them to abuse or annoyance. This
      does not mean that they are to be given preference over others who are
      known through the texts to be more virtuous than them, such as Abu Bakr,
      ‘Umar and ‘Uthmaan (may Allaah be pleased with them all).",Written by Shaykh ‘Abd al-Kareem al-Khudayr
7190,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7190,Can a    man harm his beautiful wife with the “evil eye”?,"I have a question about ayn. If a man were to say to his wife that she looks beautiful should he always say mashaa’Allah, or is this excessive?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly:
the “evil eye” is real, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The evil eye is real, and if anything were to overtake the divine decree (al-qadar) it would be the evil eye.”
(Narrated by Muslim, 2188, from the hadith of Ibn ‘Abbas).
Al-Bukhari (5048) and Muslim (2187) narrated the first part of this hadith from Abu Hurayrah.
Secondly:
the evil eye usually comes from people who are jealous or envious (hasad).
Ibn al-Qayyim said:
Everyone who gives the evil eye is jealous, but not everyone who is jealous gives the evil eye… then he said:
It begins when the person likes something, then his evil soul dwells on the matter, and by continually looking at the person who has the thing of which he feels jealous, he directs his venom towards him. A person may put the evil eye on himself, or he may put the evil eye on someone else without intending to, because it is is a part of his nature. This is the worst type of human being. Our companions and other fuqahaa’ said: if someone is known for this, he should be detained by the imaam (leader), who should spend on him and provide for him until he dies. This idea is absolutely correct… (Zaad al-Ma’aad, 4/167).
In the hadith, it says, “A’oodhu bi kalimaat-Illaah it-taamah min kulli shaytaanin wa haammah wa min kulli ‘aynin laammah (I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allah from every devil and vermin and from every envious eye).”
Narrated by al-Bukhari (3191) from the hadith of Ibn ‘Abbas.
The meaning of “vermin” (haammah) is lethally poisonous animals and insects.
The meaning of “envious” (laammah) is that which causes harm because of jealousy (hasad).
Thirdly:
Although it is correct that the evil eye comes from people who feel jealous (hasad), it may also come from a person who is not jealous but merely likes something, because of the hadith: “Whoever among you sees something in himself or in his possessions or in his brother that he likes, let him pray for blessing for it, because the evil eye is real.”
Narrated by Ibn al-Sunni in ‘Aml al-Yawm wa’l-Laylah, p. 168; and by al-Haakim, 4/216. Classed as saheeh by al-Albani in al-Kalim al-Tayyib, 244.
This hadith explains that a person may harm himself or his wealth – and no one feels jealous of himself – but he may harm himself with the evil eye by admiring himself, so it is even more possible that he may harm his wife in the same way.
Ibn al-Qayyim said:
And a man may put the evil eye on himself. (Zaa’d al-Ma’aad, 4/167).
Fourthly:
a man may harm his wife with the evil eye by looking at her and noticing her beauty and admiring her, even if he does not actually say to her “You are beautiful.” It is mustahabb for him to say, “Allahumma baarik fihaa (O Allah, bless her).”
It was reported from Abu Umaamah ibn Sahl ibn Hunayf that his father told him that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went out and they travelled with him towards Makkah until they reached Shi’b al-Khazzaar in al-Juhfah. Sahl ibn Hunayf washed himself, and he was a white man with a handsome body and skin. ‘Aamir ibn Rabee’ah, the brother of Bani ‘Udayy ibn Ka’b, looked at him when he was washing, and said, “I have never seen anything like this, not even the skin of a virgin in seclusion!” (this was a metaphor for the intense whiteness of his skin). Then Sahl suffered a seizure (an epileptic fit, in which he fell to the ground). He was brought to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and it was said, “O Messenger of Allah, do you know what has happened to Sahl? By Allah, he cannot raise his head and he will not wake up.” He said, “Do you accuse anyone with regard to him?” They said, “‘Aamir ibn Rabee’ah looked at him.” So the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) called ‘Aamir and spoke angrily with him, saying, “Would any of you like to kill his brother? If you see something that you like, why do you not pray for blessing for it?” Then he said to him (‘Aamir), “Do ghusl for him.” So he washed his face, hands, elbows, the soles of his feet and inside his izaar (lower garment) from a vessel, then that water was poured over him (Sahl) – a man poured it over his head and back from behind, tilting the vessel. This was done to him, then Sahl went on with the people and there was nothing wrong with him.
(Al-Musnad, 3/486. Al-Haythami said: the men of Ahmad are the men of saheeh. Al-Majma’, 5/107).
Fifthly:
When they like something, some people say “Ma sha’ Allah laa quwwata illa Billaah (That which Allah wills (will come to pass)! There is no power but with Allah)”. They take as evidence for this an aayah in Soorat al-Kahf and a hadith.
The aayah in question is (interpretation of the meaning):
“It was better for you to say, when you entered your garden: ‘That which Allah wills (will come to pass)! There is no power but with Allah!’” [Al-Kahf 18:39]. But this is not evidence (daleel), because the subject of the aayah has nothing to do with hasad (envy); in fact, Allah destroyed his garden because of his kufr and transgression.
The hadith in question was reported from Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him), saying that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Whoever sees something that he likes, and says, ‘Ma sha Allah laa quwwata illa Billaah’, the evil eye will not affect him.” But this hadith is da’eef jiddan (very weak)!
Al-Haythami said: this was narrated by al-Bazzaar from the report of Abu Bakr al-Hudhali, who is da’eef jiddan (very weak).

So Hijrah means migrating emigrating) to join other Muslims. Hijrah may also take the form of moving from one land of shirk to another land of shirk where evil is less prevalent and there is less danger to the Muslims, as when some of the Muslims migrated from Makkah, at the command of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), to Abyssinia (Ethiopia).

7193,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7193,The    girl’s father disagrees with a marriage –what is the solution?,"I have a question regarding marrige. If a father disagrees with a marrage along racial lines or because that person is upon the manhaj of the salaf and there is no islamic judge in your locality e.g. Carribbean, What should that person do according to the Qur'an and Sunnah?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: it is not permissible for a man to marry a woman without the permission of her walee (guardian), regardless of whether she is a virgin or previously-married. This is the view of the majority of scholars, including al-Shaafai, Maalik and Ahmad. They take as evidence (daleel) the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him):
There should be no nikaah (marriage contract) except with a wali (guardian).
(Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1101; Abu Dawood, 2085; Ibn Maajah, 1881. It is saheeh, as stated in Irwaa al-Ghaleel,6/235, by al-Albaani, may Allaah have mercy on him).
And the hadeeth:
Any woman who gets married without the permission of her wali, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid. If her husband has consummated the marriage, then the mahr belongs to her in return for that. If she does not have a wali then the (Muslim) ruler is the wali of anyone who does not have a wali.
(Narrated and classed as hasan by al-Tirmidhi, 1102; Abu Dawood, 2083; Ibn Maajah, 1879).
Secondly: if her wali prevents her from marrying the person she wants with no shari reason for doing so, the guardianship passes to someone who is fit to be a wali, so it may pass from her father to her grandfather, for example.
Thirdly: if all her guardians prevent her for no shari reason, then the (Muslim) ruler will be her wali, because of the hadeeth, If she does not have a wali, then the (Muslim) ruler is the wali of anyone who does not have a wali. The ruler here means the judge who rules according to shareeah.
The wali does not have the right to prevent a woman from marrying on the basis of his own whims and with no shari reason.
It was reported that al-Hasan said: Maqil ibn Yassaar told me that [this aayah] was revealed concerning him. He said: I married a sister of mine to a man, and he divorced her. When her iddah was over, he came and asked to marry her. I said to him, I married her to you and I treated you well and honoured you, then you divorced her. And now you come asking to marry her! No, by Allaah, she will never go back to you! He was a man who had nothing wrong with him, and the woman wanted to go back to him. Then Allaah revealed this aayah (interpretation of the meaning): do not prevent them [al-Baqarah 2:232]. So I said, Now I will do it, O Messenger of Allaah. So he married her to him.
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4837).
According to another report, he said:
It was concerning me that this aayah was revealed (interpretation of the meaning): And when you have divorced women and they have fulfilled the term of their prescribed period, do not prevent them from marrying their (former) husbands [al-Baqarah 2:232].
Fourthly: If there is no wali and no shari judge, then her case should be referred to the ruler or whoever is acting in his stead. If there is no such person, then her case should be referred to the shareeah courts. If there is no shareeah court, then her case should be referred to a man who holds a position of leadership among his people and is committed to Islam. If there is no such man, then her case should be referred to any trustworthy and religiously-committed man who is fit to be a wali.
Ibn Qudaamah said: if a woman does not have a wali and there is no ruler, then according to Ahmad, any religiously-committed man may arrange her marriage with her permission.
(al-Mughni, 7/352).
Shaykh Umar Al-Ashqar says:
If there is no Muslim ruler and the woman is in a place where the Muslims do not have a ruler and she has no wali at all, such as the Muslims in America etc., then if there are Islamic organizations in that country which take care of the Muslims affairs, they should step in and take care of arranging her marriage. The same applies if the Muslims have a leader whom they obey or someone who takes care of their affairs.
(Al-Waadih fi Sharh Qaanoon al-Ahwaal al-Shakhsiyyah al-Urduni, p. 70).
All of this [transferring guardianship to someone other than the girls father] must be with the consent of the girl and should not result in greater corruption than preventing you from marrying her. It should also be on the condition that the reason for [the fathers] refusal is invalid according to the shareeah, as you have explained.
Fifthly: it is not permissible for the walee to refuse marriage because the prospective husband does not follow his manhaj of dawah, or because he is not of his tribe or from his country. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded us to marry religious people and not to refuse them, otherwise corruption and tribulation would be the result.
Abu Hurayrah said: the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: If someone whose religious commitment and attitude pleases you proposes marriage, then marry [your female relative under your charge] to him. If you do not do that, there will be tribulation in the land and much corruption.
(Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1084; Ibn Maajah, 1967. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani, may Allaah have mercy on him, in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah. 1022).
Sixthly: by the same token, it is not permissible for a woman to justify a marriage to whomever she wishes on the grounds that this person is following the same manhaj of dawah. It is sufficient for her that the person who is proposing marriage is religiously committed and has a good attitude.

7198,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7198,Do You Have to Recite Surahs in Order in Prayer?,"My question is regarding the order in which the Quran should be recited in a prayer, either out loud or quietly.

What is Tankis al-Huruf (inversion of letters)?


What is Tankis al-Kalimat (inversion of words)?


What is Tankis al-Ayat (inversion of verses)?


What is Tankis al-Suwar (inversion of Surahs)?




Ruling on Tankis al-Suwar","Praise be to Allah.Types of Tankis
Reading later parts of the Quran before earlier parts is called Tankis (inversion). There are different types of Tankis:
·        Tankis al-Huruf (inversion of letters)
·        Tankis al-Kalimat (inversion of words)
·        Tankis al-Ayat (inversion of verses)
·        Tankis al-Suwar (inversion of Surahs)
What is Tankis al-Huruf (inversion of letters)?
Tankis al-Huruf (inversion of letters) means putting a later letter before a previous letter in one word, for example, instead of Rabb one reads Barr
Undoubtedly this is haram, and invalidates a person's prayer, because it changes the Quran from the way in which it was spoken by Allah, and usually alters the meaning in a drastic manner. ((Al-Sharh al-Mumti’ by Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 3/110)
What is Tankis al-Kalimat (inversion of words)?
Tankis al-Kalimat (inversion of words) means putting a later word before a previous word, for example, instead of Qul huwa Allahu ahad, one reads Ahad Allah huwa qul!
This also is undoubtedly haram, because it changes the Quran from the way in which it was spoken by Allah. (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 3/110)
What is Tankis al-Ayat (inversion of verses)?
Tankis al-Aayat (inversion of verses) means reciting a later ayah before a previous ayah, for example, reciting min sharr il-waswas il-khannas before ilah il-nas!
Concerning this, al-Qadi ‘Iyad (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
“There is no dispute concerning the order of the verses in each Surah. This is something which is tawqifi, i.e., based on revelation [and is not open to ijtihad], and the order is that which now appears in the Mus-haf, and this is how the ummah transmitted it from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).” (Sharh al-Nawawi, 6/62. This was also the view of Ibn al-’Arabi, as stated in al-Fath, 2/257)
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said:
Tankis al-ayat (inverting verses) is also haram according to the most correct view, because the order of the verses is tawqifi (something which is based on revelation [and not open to ijtihad]). The meaning of tawqifi is that it was dictated by the order of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 3/110)
What is Tankis al-Suwar (inversion of Surahs)?
Tankis al-Suwar (inversion of Surahs) means, reciting later Surahs before earlier ones, for example, reciting Al ‘Imran before al-Baqarah.
Ruling on Tankis al-Suwar
Those scholars who say that the order of Surahs is not tawqifi do not see anything wrong with this.
Those who think that it is tawqifi or that the consensus of the Companions on the order of Surahs is evidence, do not think that it is permissible.
The correct view is that the order of Surahs is not tawqifi; it is the result of ijtihad on the part of some of the Companions.
There was no ijma` (consensus) among the Companions on the order of Surahs; the order in the Mus-haf of ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ud for example is different from that in the Mus-hafs of others.
In the Sunnah there is evidence that supports the view that it is permissible:
Hudhayfah said: I prayed with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) one night, and he started to recite al-Baqarah. I thought he would do ruku’ when he reached one hundred ayas, but he kept going. I thought he would complete it in one rak`ah, but he kept going. I thought, he would do ruku’ now, but he started to recite al-Nisa, and he recited all of it, then he started to recite Al Imran and recited all of it. (Narrated by Muslim, 772).
The evidence in this hadith is that he recited al-Nisa then Al Imran.
Al-Nawawi said:
“Al-Qadi ‘Iyad said: this contains evidence for those who say that the order of Surahs is the result of ijtihad on the part of the Muslims when they wrote down the Mus-haf. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not dictate the order of Surahs; he entrusted this task to his ummah after his death. This is the view of Malik and the majority of the scholars, and was the view favoured by al-Qadi Abu Bakr al-Baqillani. Ibn al-Baqillani said: it is the more correct of the two views, although both are possible.
He said: what we say is that the order of Surahs is not binding when writing, praying, studying, teaching or learning. There is no report from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) concerning that which would make it forbidden to differ from it. Hence the order of Surahs in the various Mus-hafs differed, before the Mus-haf of ‘Uthman.
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the ummah after him in all ages regarded it as permissible to differ from the order of Surahs in prayer , and when studying and teaching.
He said: with regard to the view of those scholars who say that (the order of Surahs) was set by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and that he put them in the same order as appears in the Mus-haf of ‘Uthman and that the different orders came about before they heard of his ruling and his final review of the Quran with Jibril they interpret the fact that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) recited al-Nisa first and then Al Imran as meaning that this happened before the final ruling was dictated, and these two Surahs appear in this order in the Mus-haf of Ubayy.
He said: there is no dispute concerning the fact that a person who is praying may recite in the second rak`ah a Surah which comes before the Surah which he recited in the first rak`ah; but it is makruh to do this in one rak`ah, or when reciting Quran outside of prayer.
He said: but some of them permitted this.
The prohibition of the Salaf against reading the Quran backwards is interpreted as referring to those who read from the end of a Surah to the beginning.
He said: there is no dispute concerning the fact that the order of verses in each Surah is based on revelation from Allah and is as it now appears in the Mus-haf and as it was transmitted by the ummah from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).” (End of the comments of al-Qadi ‘Iyad). And Allah knows best.” (Sharh Muslim, 6/61, 62)
Al-Sindi said:
The phrase [in the hadith of Hudhayfah] then he started to recite Al ‘Imran means that it is not obligatory to follow the order of Surahs when reciting. (Sharh al-Nasai, 3/226)
·        It was reported from Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) that a man from among the Ansar used to lead them in prayer in the mosque of Quba. Every time he led them in prayer, he would start his recitation with Qul huwa Allahu ahad, then when he finished it, he would recite another Surah. He did that in every rak`ah. His companions spoke with him and said, You always start with this Surah, then you do not think it is enough and you recite another. Either you should recite this Surah alone, or you should leave it and recite another. He said, I am not going to stop reciting it. If you like, I will lead you in prayer as I have been doing, and if you do not like it, I will leave you. They felt that he was one of the best of them, and they did not want anyone else to lead them in prayer. When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came to them, they told him about this. He said, O So and So, what is stopping you from doing what your companions tell you? What makes you keep on reciting this Surah in every rak`ah? He said, I love it. He said, Your love for it will grant you admittance to Paradise. (Narrated by al-Bukhari mu’allaqan, and by al-Tirmidhi with an isnad similar to that of al-Bukhari, 2901).
The evidence in this report is the fact that the man recited Surat al-Ikhlas in his prayer before any other Surah that comes before it (in the Mus-haf), and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) approved of that.
·        This is the action of ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him).
Al-Imam al-Bukhari said:
“Al-Ahnaf recited al-Kahf in the first rak`ah and Yusuf or Yunus in the second, and he said that he had prayed Fajr with ‘Umar and he had done the same.” (Bab al-Jam’ bayna Suratayn fil-Rak`ah, in Kitab al-Adhan)
With regard to the latter part of your question, we say:
It is permissible to recite verses 50-60 of al-Baqarah in the first rak`ah, then to recite verses 1-20 of al-Baqarah in the second rak`ah, because then the meaning of the passage will be complete.
But reciting verses 10-20 means that one is cutting off the meaning, so it is better not to do this. Perhaps you mentioned the numbers only by way of example and you did not mean these particular verses.
