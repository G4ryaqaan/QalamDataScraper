44922,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/44922,Editing a book containing pictures,"We are a new company wich is dealing about design. About more than 1 month ago we get a contract with a bank to edit a training book for it employees. The problem is that before we edit this book we thought that we will be able to edit a book without pictures, but the bank ask us to edit a book with pictures. We know that pictures is haram, so I asked to my brother that we can not edit such book, but my friend reply me that we can not stop our contract cause if we stop it the bank will lead us to the justice court and we may have very serious problems. So we continue our contract with this bank till we finished to edit this book, now the book is being printing and we will soon receive the paymenent of the bank for our work. So our dear sheikh here is another problem too, I just read that dealing with company wich are dealing with ribaa is haram, and the bank for wich we edited the book is a pure ribaa bank. So we will soon receive the payment of this bank, is this money haram ? If this money is haram, can I take back my personnal money I invest to buy the ink for the printer and to buy the orther things wich had a connection with this project. Can I pay the employee and the rent of the computer that we use for this project and all other equipements and electricity and bill phones ? Can we use the money of this bank to pay the taxes (like automotive insurances and so on …) and to pay back debts ? For the money wich will left what we will do with it ? can I give it to poor people or to build Islamic center or to use it for other dawah purpose ?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    If what is meant by your words “pictures are haraam” is 
    photographs, this matter has been discussed previously in the answers to 
    questions no. 13633,
    10668 and
    7918. 

    Drawing pictures of animate beings by hand is haraam. See 
    question no. 39806. 

    You do not say anything in your question about the content of 
    this book. If the book is an advertisement for the activities of the 
    riba-based bank, then printing it is haraam because that involves helping 
    the bank to deal in riba. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Help you one another in 
    Al‑Birr and At‑Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one 
    another in sin and transgression”

    [al-Maa’idah 5:2]

    So it is not permissible to accept any payment at all, and 
    you should donate all income from this project to charity. 

    But if the content of the book is permissible and by printing the book you are not helping the bank in its haraam activities or doing advertising for them, then take out of the money enough to purify it, i.e., the payment for printing haraam pictures. We ask Allaah to compensate you with something better, for whoever gives up something for the sake of Allaah, Allaah will compensate him with something better than that.

44923,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/44923,His mother wants him to divorce his second wife so that no one else will follow his example and marry more than one wife,"I am a lady who has been married for a short time because I am the second wife of a married man. His mother has asked him to divorce me, not because of any bad conduct on my part, but merely so that his sisters’ husbands will not follow his example. She says that she does not care if there is any sin on her because of this demand, what matters is not to go against custom by entering into a plural marriage. What is the Islamic point of view on this matter? Does my husband have to obey her in that, knowing that I live with him according to the way of Allaah?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The mother has no right to tell her son to divorce his wife just because he is going against his family’s or tribe’s custom by taking a second wife, or because she fears that her daughter’s husbands may follow his example, because plural marriage is something that has been permitted by Allaah and by His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
The son does not have to obey his father or mother with regard to divorcing his wife, especially if that is for a reason that is contrary to the aims of sharee’ah, namely to have many children and keep Muslim women chaste and reduce immorality. 
It says in Mutaalib Oola’l-Nuha (5/320): A son is not obliged to obey his parents, even if they are of good character, with regard to divorcing his wife, because this is not part of honouring one's parents. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah was asked about a married man who has children, but his mother dislikes his wife and tells him to divorce her. Is it permissible for him to divorce her? The answer was: It is not permissible for him to divorce her because of what his mother says, rather he should honour his mother, but divorcing his wife is not part of honouring his mother. And Allaah knows best. 
Al-Fataawa al-Kubra, 3/331 
Your husband has to honour his mother and treat her kindly, whilst keeping you as his wife, because it is not part of honouring his mother to divorce his wife. 
This mother should be advised and reminded that it is essential to follow the laws of Islam, and to beware of drawing nigh to sin. She should realize that whether her daughters will get divorced or not, or their husbands will take second wives or not, are matters of the unseen which no one knows except Allaah. Whatever He wills will happen, so there is no point in committing haraam actions and splitting up families. 
Our advise to you is to strive your hardest to treat your husband’s mother kindly and to win her love, so that your kind treatment of her will erase from her mind the idea of telling her son to divorce you.

44945,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/44945,If maniy comes out after doing ghusl from janaabah,"I am a young man. I try very hard to avoid the secret habit but unfortunately I am too weak sometimes. After I do ghusl, it so happens that some thin, sticky liquid comes out. Does this mean that I have to do ghusl even if it is maniy? Please note that it comes out without any feelings of desire. Or is it permissible to remove the impurity by washing it away?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: You have to repent to Allaah from the secret habit and give it up, and beware of the consequences of sinning repeatedly, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If a person commits a sin, a black spot appears on his heart. If he stops and seeks forgiveness and repents, his heart is cleansed, but if he goes back to it, it increases until it covers his entire heart. This is the raan which Allaah mentions (interpretation of the meaning): ‘Nay! But on their hearts is the Raan (covering of sins and evil deeds) which they used to earn’ [al-Mutaffifeen 83:14].” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3257; Ibn Maajah, 4234; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, no. 2654. Please see also question no. 329, where there is an explanation of how to give up this bad habit. 
Secondly: If a person does ghusl after having a wet dream or intercourse, then something comes out of him after that, unaccompanied by feelings of desire, he does not have to do ghusl again. . Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: If a person has a wet dream or has intercourse, and ejaculates, then he does ghusl, then some semen comes out of him, the well-known view narrated from Ahmad is that he does not have to do ghusl again. Al-Khallaal said: there are many reports from Abu ‘Abd-Allaah – i.e., Imam Ahmad – that say that all he has to do is wudoo’, whether he urinated or not, and this is the view that he settled on. This was also narrated from ‘Ali, Ibn ‘Abbaas, ‘Ata’, al-Zuhri, Maalik, al-Layth, al-Thawri and Ishaaq. Sa’eed ibn Jubayr said: He does not have to do ghusl unless that was accompanied by feelings of desire. 
There is also another opinion, which is that it does not matter if that happened after urinating, and he does not have to do ghusl in that case, but if it happened before urinating, then he does have to do ghusl. This is the view of al-Awzaa’i and Abu Haneefah, and was also narrated from al-Hasan. That is because this is the left overs of what was emitted as a result of desire, so ghusl is required as it was in the first instance. But after urinating, it comes out without gushing and with no feelings of desire, and we cannot be sure that it is something left over from the first instance, because if it were something left over then it would not have stayed after urinating. 
Al-Qaadi said: there is also a third opinion, which is that he has to do ghusl in either case. This is the view of al-Shaafa’i, because what matters is that it has come out, as in the case of all the things that nullify purity. He said elsewhere: he does not have to do ghusl, because the janaabah is one and the same so there is no need for two ghusls. It is as if it all came out in one go… From al-Mughni, 1/128. 
The correct view is that if it comes out with no feelings of desire, then ghusl is not required, as it says in al-Insaaf, 1/232; and in Kashshaaf al-Qinaa’, 1/141, where it says “If semen comes out after doing ghusl then ghusl is not required. Or if semen comes out “after doing ghusl following intercourse in which he did not ejaculate”, with no feelings of desire, then no ghusl is required; and if the remaining semen comes out with no feelings of desire he does not have to do ghusl, because of the report narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas, that he was asked about something coming out of a person after he had done ghusl from janaabah. He said: “Let him do wudoo’.” Something similar was narrated by Imam Ahmad from ‘Ali. And because this is one emission of semen so only one ghusl is required, as if it all came out in one go. And because it came out with no feelings of desire, as in the case when it is emitted because of cold. This is the reason that Ahmad gave; he said: because the desire is past, and rather it is a nullification of purity and I hope that wudoo’ will be sufficient. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The words “if something comes out after that, he does not have to do (ghusl) again” mean: if he does ghusl for this emission of semen, then some more comes out when he starts to move about, then he does not have to repeat ghusl. The evidence for that is as follows: 
1 – The reason is one and the same, so two ghusls are not required. 
2 – When it comes out after that, it is not accompanied by feelings of pleasure. And ghusl is only required if it comes out with feelings of pleasure. 
But if semen is emitted anew with feelings of desire, then ghusl is required as a result of this new reason. 
From al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 1/281. See also question no. 12352. 
Thirdly:  What is prescribed when doing ghusl from janaabah is to remove whatever of semen etc has contaminated the body, then to start to do ghusl beginning with the parts of the body that are washed in wudoo’, then pouring water over the rest of the body, because this is proven in the description of the ghusl of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Al-Bukhaari (251) and Muslim (476) narrated that Maymoonah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: I prepared water for the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) for ghusl. He pour water with his right hand onto his left and washed them (his hands), then he washed his private part, then he wiped his hand on the ground, then he washed it. Then he rinsed his mouth and nose, then he washed his face, and poured water on his head. Then he shifted position and washed his feet. Then he was brought a cloth but he did not use it.”  
If you remove some impurity etc that does not invalidate ghusl because what is required in ghusl is to wash the entire body with water – as well as rinsing the mouth and nose, according to the correct opinion – with the intention of doing ghusl. It is not a condition of removing impurity that one should avoid touching impurity whilst doing so.

But it is mustahabb for the one who commits a sin to do wudu , because wudu expiates for sins, as is proven from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
It was mentioned by al-Shirazi in al-Muhadhdhab (2/73) and Ibn Hazm said in al-Muhalla (1/241), narrating from `Aishah, Ibn Mas’ud and others among the Companions  (may Allah be pleased with them), that it is enjoined to do wudu after speaking bad words.  
Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmu’ (2/72): 
“The correct view is that it is mustahabb to do wudu after saying bad words, such as backbiting, malicious gossip, lying, slander, false speech, immoral speech and the like. The purpose of that is expiation for sins, as is proven in the hdiths, but that is not obligatory.”
Ibn al-Mundhir said in his books al-Ishraf and al-Ijma’: 
“The scholars are unanimously agreed that it is not obligatory to do wudu after saying bad words such as backbiting, slander, false speech and the like… al-Shafi’i, Ibn al-Mundhir, al-Bayhaqi and our companions quoted as evidence the hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever says in his oath ‘By al-Lat and al-‘Uzza,’ let him say ‘La ilaha ill-Allah,’ and whoever says to another, ‘Come and gamble with me,’ let him give charity.” Narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim.

44971,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/44971,Repulsive forms of pleasure,My question is: is it permissible for the husband to put his finger in his wife’s anus and move it as if in intercourse? I am asking because my husband asked this question of the imam of the mosque and he said that it is permissible for him to do that. Hence I am asking the scholars in order to be sure. May Allaah reward you with good.,,,"Praise be to Allah.It is permissible for a man to enjoy his wife in whatever way he wants, so long as he avoids having intercourse at the time of her period and anal intercourse, because of the report narrated by Muslim (302) from Anas: that that when a woman among them menstruated, the Jews would not eat with her or sit with her in their houses. So the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about that, and Allaah revealed the words (interpretation of the meaning): 
“They ask you concerning menstruation. Say: that is an Adha (a harmful thing for a husband to have a sexual intercourse with his wife while she is having her menses), therefore, keep away from women during menses”
[al-Baqarah 2:222]
The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Do everything except intercourse.” News of that reached the Jews and they said: “This man does not want to leave any of our affairs without differing from it.” 
Al-Tirmidhi (135), Abu Dawood (3904) and Ibn Maajah (639) narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever has intercourse with a menstruating woman or with a woman in her back passage, or comes to a soothsayer, has disbelieved in that which was revealed to Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
Ahmad (9731) and Abu Dawood (2162) narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Cursed be the one who has intercourse with his wife in her back passage.” This hadeeth was classed as hasan by Shu’ayb al-Arna’oot in Tahqeeq al-Musnad and by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
With regard to putting one’s finger in the anus, the least that can be said is that it is makrooh, because it involves direct contact with impure matter (najaasah) and filth, and because it may lead one to do that which is obviously haraam, namely intercourse in the back passage.  The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
“Whoever is cautious in the dubious matters will save his religious commitment and his honour, but whoever falls into dubious matters will fall into haraam, like a shepherd who grazes his flocks around a private pasture and is liable to enter it at any moment.”  Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 52; Muslim, 1599. 
The above view that it is makrooh is supported by the fact that the scholars explained the reason why anal intercourse is forbidden is the presence of filth. Ibn Qudaamah said: Because the Sunnah refers to the prohibition on anal intercourse, therefore it is forbidden. And it is forbidden because of the impurity, and that applies only to intercourse in the back passage. 
Al-Mughni, 7/226. 
This undoubtedly also applies to inserting the finger into the anus.

Is that wetness tahir (pure) or najis (impure)?


Does that wetness invalidate wudu’?","Praise be to Allah.Does discharge break wudu?
It seems that the questioner is asking about the ruling on the wetness that comes from a woman’s vagina. The scholars differed concerning this, and in order to explain it we must look at two issues. 
Is that wetness tahir (pure) or najis (impure)?
1- The first opinion is that it is tahir. This is the view of al-Shafi’i and Ahmad. 
2- The second opinion is that it is najis. 
The more correct opinion is the first one, because there is no evidence to suggest that this wetness is najis. It says in al-Mughni: “Because ‘Aishah used to scratch the semen from the garment of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) – after intercourse – and that semen is usually mixed with the wetness of the vagina. And because if we deem the woman’s vagina to be najis that means that we deem the fluid emitted from it to be najis too.” 
Does that wetness invalidate wudu’?
The scholars differed concerning this and there are two views: 

The first opinion is that it does invalidate wudu. This is the view of the majority. They quoted as evidence the fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told the woman who was suffering from irregular bleeding (istihadah) to do wudu for every prayer, and that wetness or discharge is akin to istihadah. 

In Sahih al-Bukhari, ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: Fatimah bint Abi Hubaysh came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: “O Messenger of Allah, I am a woman who suffers irregular bleeding (istihadah) and I do not become pure; should I stop praying?” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No. That is just a vein and it is not menses. When the time of your regular menses comes, stop praying, then when it ends wash the blood from yourself and start praying again.” He (Hisham) said: My father (‘Urwah ibn al-Zubayr) said: “Then do wudu for every prayer, until that time comes.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, no. 228) 
Al-Hafiz said in al-Fath concerning the additional material which speaks of wudu: Some of them say that this is mu’allaq, but that is not correct, rather it was narrated with the isnad mentioned from Muhammad, from Abu Mu’awiyah, from Hisham. Al-Tirmidhi explained that in his narration. Someone else claimed that the words “Then do wudu” are the words of ‘Urwah, but this is debatable, because if they were his words, he would have spoken in the third person, and said, “Then she should do wudu” etc. But as it appears in the imperative, it goes with the instructions mentioned in the marfu’ report when he said, “Then wash the blood from yourself.” (Al-Fath, 1/332; see also 1/409 and al-Irwa 1/146, 224) 

The second opinion is that it does not invalidate wudu. This is the view of Ibn Hazm. 

Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah has two views on this issue, like the two views mentioned above. In al-Ikhtiyarat he favoured the view that it does not invalidate wudu and in Majmu’ al-Fatawa he favoured the view of the majority. (See Majmu’ al-Fatawa (21/221) and al-Ikhtiyarat, p. 27) 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin discussed the two views in detail and said: 
“After researching the matter, it seems to me that the discharge that comes from a woman, if it does not come from the bladder and it comes from the uterus , then it is tahir, but it invalidates wudu even though it is tahir, because it is not essential for the thing that invalidates wudu to be najis. The wind that comes from the back passage has no substance, but it still invalidates wudu. Based on this, if it is emitted by a woman and she has wudu, then her wudu is invalidated and she has to renew it. But if it is continuous , then it does not invalidate wudu, but she should not do wudu for prayer until the time for the prayer begins. Then she may offer both obligatory and nafl prayers, read Quran and do whatever she wants of permissible things, as the scholars said concerning one who suffers from urinary incontinence . 
This is the ruling on this discharge with regard to purity; it is tahir and does not make clothing or the body najis. 
As for the ruling with regard to wudu, it invalidates wudu unless it is continuous. If it is continuous it invalidates wudu but the woman does not have to do wudu for any prayer until after the time for it has begun, and she has to wear sanitary pads. 
But if it comes and goes, and it usually stops during the times of prayer, then she should delay her prayer until the times when it stops, so long as there is no fear of the time for prayer ending. If she fears that the time for prayer will end, then she should do wudu and wear a sanitary pad and pray. It makes no difference whether there is a little or a lot, because all of it is coming from the same place and a little of it or a lot invalidates wudu. 
With regard to the belief of some women that it does not invalidate wudu, I know of no basis for this apart from the view of Ibn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him), who said that it does not invalidate wudu, but he did not mention any evidence for that. If he had any evidence from the Quran or Sunnah or sayings of the Sahabah, that would be proof. Women should fear Allah and strive to purify themselves, because prayer is not accepted without purity, even if a woman prays one hundred times. Some scholars even say that the one who prays without being pure is a kafir because this is a kind of mocking the signs of Allah.” (Majmu’ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 1/284-286)

In fact I do not know how to respond to that.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) married ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) after he married Sawdah bint Zam’ah (may Allah be pleased with her). She – ‘Aa’ishah – was the only virgin whom he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) married. And he consummated the marriage with her when she was nine years old. 
Among her virtues was the fact that the Revelation did not descend when he under one cover with any of his wives other than her. She was one of the dearest of all people to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and news of her innocence was revealed from above the seven heavens. She was one of the most knowledgeable of his wives, and one of the most knowledgeable women of the ummah as a whole. The senior companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to refer to her opinion and consult her. 
With regard to the story of her marriage, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had grieved over the death of the Mother of the Believers Khadeejah, who had supported him and stood by his side, and he called the year in which she died The Year of Sorrow. Then he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) married Sawdah, who was an older woman and was not very beautiful; rather he married her to console her after her husband had died and she stayed among mushrik people. Four years later the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) married ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), and he was over fifty. Perhaps the reasons for the marriage were as follows: 
1 – He saw a dream about marrying her. It is proven in al-Bukhaari from the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to her: “You were shown to me twice in a dream. I saw that you were wrapped in a piece of silk, and it was said, ‘This is your wife.’ I uncovered her and saw that it was you. I said, ‘If this is from Allah then it will come to pass.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, no. 3682). As to whether this is a prophetic vision as it appears to be, or a regular dream that may be subject to interpretation, there was a difference of opinion among the scholars, as mentioned by al-Haafiz in Fath al-Baari, 9/181. 
2 – The characteristics of intelligence and smartness that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had noticed in ‘Aa’ishah even as a small child, so he wanted to marry her so that she would be more able than others to transmit reports of what he did and said. In fact, as stated above, she was a reference point for the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) with regard to their affairs and rulings. 
3 – The love of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) for her father Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him), and the persecution that Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) had suffered for the sake of the call of truth, which he bore with patience. He was the strongest of people in faith and the most sincere in certain faith, after the Prophets. 
It may be noted that among his wives were those who were young and old, the daughter of his sworn enemy, the daughter of his closest friend. One of them occupied herself with raising orphans, another distinguished herself  from others by fasting and praying qiyaam a great deal… They represented all kinds of people, through whom the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was able to set out a way for the Muslims showing how to deal properly with all kinds of people. [See al-Seerah al-Nabawiyyah fi Daw’ al-Masaadir al-Asliyyah, p. 711]. 
With regard to the issue of her being young and your being confused about that, you should note that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) grew up in a hot country, the Arabian Peninsula. Usually in hot countries adolescence comes early and people marry early. This is how the people of Arabia were until recently. Moreover, women vary greatly in their development and their physical readiness for marriage. 
If you think – may Allah guide you – that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not marry any virgin other than ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), and that all his other wives had been previously married, this will refute the notion spread by many hostile sources, that the basic motive behind the Prophet’s marriages was physical desire and enjoyment of women, because if that was his intention he would have chosen only those who were virgins and beautiful etc.    
Such slanders against the Prophet of Mercy (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) by kaafirs and others of their ilk, are indicative of their inability to find fault with the law and religion that he brought from Allah, so they try to find ways to criticize Islam with regard to issues that are not related to sharee’ah. 
And Allah is the Source of strength. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.

44995,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/44995,Should she spend on her parents who are poor without her husband’s approval?,"My father is in need of financial help because his income is not enough to spend on himself and my mother. I work and my financial situation is very good, and I can afford to help my father. 

But my husband does not allow me to give them any financial help, on the grounds that I have brothers and they are responsible for spending on their parents and the daughters are not responsible. 

I have three brothers and their financial situation is o.k., but they cannot afford to spend on my parents. There are four of us daughters but I am the only one who works and can help my family. But my husband is strict in not letting me do that. What should I do? Should I obey my husband and listen to what he says? Or should I obey my family and help them even if that is without my husband’s knowledge? I hope that you can advise me. If the wife wants to spend on her family, does she have to ask her husband’s permission to do so?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The child – male or female – who can afford it has to spend 
    on his parents if they are poor and needy. 

    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. And 
    that you be dutiful to your parents”

    [al-Isra’ 17:23]

    Part of being dutiful is spending on them if they are in 
    need. 

    Ibn al-Mundhir (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    The scholars are agreed that spending on parents who are poor 
    and have no income and no money is obligatory on the child. 

    The fact that you have brothers does not mean that you are 
    not obliged to spend on your parents, because your brothers cannot afford to 
    spend on them, as you mentioned. 

    See al-Mughni, 11/375-376. 

    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in al-Ikhtiyaaraat, 
    p. 487: 
The son who is well-off 
    (rich) has to spend on his father if he is not well off (poor), and on his 
    father’s wife, and on his younger brothers and sisters. 

    Based on this, what your husband says about this being the 
    responsibility of your brothers only, is not correct. 

    Since your spending on them is obligatory, it is not 
    permissible for you to obey your husband in this matter, because the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no 
    obedience if it involves disobedience to Allaah, rather obedience is only 
    with regard to that which is right and proper.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4340; Muslim, 1840. 

    At the same time, you must also be gentle with your husband and try to convince him about that, and convince him that this is what Allaah has enjoined on you, namely the duty to honour your parents and treat them kindly.

44997,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/44997,Her family took her away without her husband’s permission,"I have a brother who has been married for several years, and he has a son and a daughter. He often has arguments with his wife, then they make up. The most recent incident was when she started cursing her parents-in-law, then she went even further and hit her husband. Then she told her family, and they came and took her away without her husband’s permission. There is a lot of immorality and lack of religious commitment, the extent of which Allah only knows. We have tried to advise them on many occasions but without success.

 I hope that you can help us and tell us to which department we may refer this matter, so that we can put an end to it.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    It is not permissible for a woman to go out of her husband’s 
    house without permission, rather many of the scholars regarded this as 
    nushooz (defiance) and going against the husband, if there is no excuse 
    for doing that, such as if her husband is harming her in a manner that she 
    cannot ward off and so on. 

    Moreover, if the wife is withholding herself from her 
    husband, he is no longer obliged to spend on her because of her defiance, as 
    the fuqaha (jurists) have stated. See al-Mughni, 8/182. 

    Secondly: 

    What your brother should do is to handle the situation wisely 
    and carefully in order to bring his wife back home. He should remind her of 
    Allah, and remind her family of Him; if he cannot do that himself, then he 
    should enlist the help of some relatives who have knowledge, experience and 
    wisdom, and get them involved so that they can solve the issue. 

    He should exercise deliberation and not be hasty in taking 
    decisions, for “Deliberation is from Allah and haste is from the Shaytan,” 
    as the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said. 
    (Classed as saheeh by al-Albani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 1895). 

    A man may make a decision at the time of anger, then regret 
    it, but at a time when regret will be to no avail. 

    He should also adopt an attitude of patience, put up with his 
    wife and try to put an end to the disputes between them that have gone on 
    for years and years. Let him start a new life with her, forgetting the past 
    and its arguments. 

    Thirdly: 

    No one is perfect, so he should accept her good points and 
    overlook her bad points, and try to change her in a wise and calm manner. 
    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No 
    believing man should hate a believing woman, for if he dislikes one of her 
    characteristics, he will be pleased with another.” 

    Al-Nawawi said: 

    This means that he should not hate her, because if he sees in 
    her a characteristic that he dislikes, he will find another that is 
    pleasing; she may be bad-tempered but at the same time 
    religiously-committed, or beautiful, or chaste, or kind to him, and so on. 
    End quote. 

    This is how all people are; they have good qualities and bad 
    qualities. The wise man is the one who strikes the right balance between 
    good and bad, accepting the good things and overlooking the bad, whilst also 
    trying to correct them. 

    Fourthly: 

    If the husband does all that but the woman still does not 
    change, then he may refer to the shar’i courts to resolve this dispute. 

    And Allah is the One Whom we ask to set the affairs of all the Muslims straight. 

    And Allah knows best.",Islam Q&A
