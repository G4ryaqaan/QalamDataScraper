32845,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/32845,Confusion about the meeqaat for the people of Makkah when doing ‘Umrah,"What do the scholars say about the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her), in which it says that she went out to al-Tan’eem for ‘Umrah, and the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) in which it says, “Even the people of Makkah should enter ihraam from Makkah, those who want to do Hajj or ‘Umrah”? How can we reconcile these two hadeeth? Please explain to us the correct view that is in accordance with the Qur’aan and Sunnah. Where should the people of Makkah enter ihraam – from al-Tan’eem or from Makkah itself?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is a good idea to quote the two hadeeth first, then explain how they may be reconciled: 
It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) defined the meeqaat of the people of Madeenah as Dhu’l-Hulayfah; that of the people of Shaam (Syria) as al-Jahfah; that of the people of Najd as Qarn al-Manaazil; and that of the people of Yemen as Yalamlam. And he said: “And these meeqaats are for the people at those very places, and besides them for those who come through those places with the intention of performing Hajj and 'Umrah; and whoever is living within these boundaries can enter Ihram from the place he starts, and the people of Makkah can start from Makkah.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim. 
It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stopped at al-Mahassab. He called ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn ‘Abi Bakr and said to him, ‘Take your sister out of the Haram (sanctuary) – according to another version: to al-Tan’eem – and let her enter ihraam for ‘umrah, then let her circumambulate the House, and I will wait for you both here.’” She said: “So we went out and I entered ihraam, then I circumambulated the House and did sa’ee between al-Safa and al-Marwah. Then we came to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) at his camp in the middle of the night, and he said, ‘Have you finished?’ I said, ‘Yes.’ He gave his companions permission to move on, and he went out to the Ka’bah and circumambulated it before Fajr prayer, then he left for Madeenah.”
Narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim. 
Based on this it may be said that the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas is general in application and means that the people of Makkah should enter ihraam from Makkah for either Hajj or ‘Umrah performed on its own or for Hajj and ‘Umrah together (qiraan); the hadeeth about ‘Aa’ishah going out of the sanctuary (the Haram) with her brother ‘Abd al-Rahmaan to enter ihraam was a specific command issued by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to her alone. The well known principle according to the scholars is that if there seems to be a contradiction between a general ruling and a specific ruling, then the specific outweighs the general, which in this case is entering ihraam for ‘Umrah from al-Tan’eem, or some other place outside the Haram. So the phrase “and the people of Makkah from Makkah” means that the people of Makkah should enter ihraam for Hajj offered on its own or for Hajj and ‘Umrah offered together (qiraan) from Makkah, and they do not have to go outside the Haram or to one of the other meeqaats mentioned in the hadeeth, in order to enter ihraam from there. 
In the case of ‘Umrah offered on its own, the one who wants to enter ihraam and is already in Makkah or within the boundaries of the Haram has to go outside the Haram – to al-Tan’eem or elsewhere – and enter ihraam from there. This was the view of the majority of scholars. Al-Muhibb al-Tabari said: I do not know of anyone who described Makkah as a meeqaat for ‘Umrah. 
So the phrase in the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) “the people of Makkah can start from Makkah” is interpreted as referring specifically to those who are performing Hajj combined with ‘Umrah (qiraan) or Hajj on its own, not those who are performing ‘Umrah on its own. 
This is supported by the fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was never given the choice between two things but he always chose the easier option, so long as it was not a sin. If entering ihraam for ‘Umrah from inside the Haram was permissible then he would have chosen that option for ‘Aa’ishah, because it would have been easier and less burdensome for him and for ‘Aa’ishah and her brother, and he would not have told her to go outside the Haram or to al-Tan’eem and enter ihraam from there.  The fact that he did not choose the option of entering ihraam from inside the Haram, which would have been easier for everyone concerned, and he chose the option of entering ihraam from outside the Haram, which is more difficult, indicates that one should enter ihraam for ‘Umrah from outside the Haram, and that this is a shar’i requirement for the one who wants to perform ‘Umrah on its own and is already in the Haram. 
And Allaah is the Source of strength.

32846,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/32846,Visiting Mount ‘Arafah,Some of the pilgrims commit themselves to visiting this mountain before or after Hajj and praying at its summit. What is the ruling on visiting this mountain and on praying there?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.This question was put to Shaykh Muhammad ibn 
    ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) and he said: “The ruling on this, as is well known from the shar’i ruling, is that everyone who worships 
    Allaah in a manner that has not been prescribed by Allaah is an innovator. From this we know that going to this mountain to pray there and to 
    touch it for blessings, and other similar things that are done by the masses, is bid’ah (an innovation). The one who does that is to be denounced 
    and he should be told that there is nothing special about this mountain, apart from the fact that it is Sunnah to stand there on the day of 
    ‘Arafah by the rocks, as the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stood there. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) stood by the rocks and said, “I stood here but all of ‘Arafah is the place of standing.” 
Based on this, there is no need for people to be hard on themselves on the day of ‘Arafah by 
    going to that mountain, maybe getting separated from their people and suffering from heat and thirst, and maybe sinning thereby, doing something 
    which Allaah has not enjoined.",From Daleel al-Akhta’ allati yaqa’ fiha al-Haaj wa’l-Mu’tamir
32863,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/32863,He went to a fortuneteller and is asking whether he can repent and how he may repent?,"Seven years ago I went to a fortuneteller then to a soothsayer; at that time I was suffering from waswaas. 
I knew that going to fortunetellers and soothsayers was shirk, but I did not know what shirk meant, or that it put one beyond the pale of Islam. All these years later I have repented to Allah from all sins. I started to read books of Tawheed so as to correct my ‘aqeedah, and I found out that I had fallen into major shirk. Can I repent? Should I repeat the shahaadah?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
We praise Allah for having guided you to repent, and we ask Him to bless you with steadfastness in adhering to the truth. 
Secondly: 
The ahaadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) clearly state that it is forbidden to go to soothsayers and fortunetellers. See question no. 8291. 
But not everyone who goes to a fortuneteller or a soothsayer is a mushrik in the sense of major shirk that puts one beyond the pale of Islam. Rather going to a fortuneteller or soothsayer falls into different categories. It may be major shirk, or it may be a sin, or it may be permissible. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: 
Those who go to fortunetellers fall into three categories: 
1 – The one who goes to a fortuneteller and asks him things without believing in what he says. This is haraam, and the punishment of the one who does that is that his prayers are not accepted for forty days, as it is narrated in Saheeh Muslim (2230), that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever goes to a fortuneteller and asks him about something, his prayer will not be accepted for forty days.” 
2 – When a person goes to a fortuneteller and asks him about something and believes what he says. This is disbelief in Allah (kufr), because he is believing the fortuneteller’s claim to have knowledge of the unseen, and believing a human’s being claim to have knowledge of the unseen constitutes disbelief in the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say: None in the heavens and the earth knows the Ghayb (Unseen) except Allah”
[al-Naml 27:65].  
Hence it says in the saheeh hadeeth: “Whoever goes to a fortuneteller and believes what he says has disbelieved in that which was revealed to Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).” 
3 – When he goes to a fortuneteller and asks him questions so that he can explain to the people what he is really doing, which is deceiving people and leading them astray. There is nothing wrong with this. The evidence for that is the fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went to Ibn Sayyaad. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) though of something to himself.  The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked him what he was thinking of and he said, “Al-dukh” meaning al-dukhaan (smoke). End quote. 
Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Rasaa’il al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 2/184 
Based on this, whoever goes to a fortuneteller or soothsayer and believes what he says and believes that he has knowledge of the unseen has committed major kufr which puts him beyond the pale of Islam. But if he does not believe what he says then he has not committed kufr. 
Whatever the case, the door of repentance is open, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah will accept the repentance of His slave so long as the death rattle has not reached his throat.” (3537) 
i.e., so long as the soul has not reached the throat. Every sin from which a man repents, Allah will accept his repentance. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say: O ‘Ibaadi (My slaves) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allah, verily, Allah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful”
[al-Zumar 39:53]
Whatever sin a person falls into, if he repents from it, his repentance will be accepted – even shirk. 
See question no. 9393. 
The basic principle is that the kaafir – and also the apostate from Islam – is required to utter the Shahaadatayn in order to enter Islam. If your going to the fortuneteller falls under the second category mentioned above, then you must utter the Shahaadatayn. As you have repented and started to live aright, you must have repeated the Shahaadatayn many times, so now you do not have to do anything. But you must resolve never to go back to such things again. 
And strive to acquire knowledge so that you may worship Allah with understanding. 
We ask Allah to help you to do that which He loves and is pleased with.",Islam Q&A
