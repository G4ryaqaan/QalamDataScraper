10613,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10613,Does a husband have to be patient with his wife all the time and not divorce her?,"We know that the wife of Nuh (as), and the wife of Lut (as) 
went to jahannam, may Allah protect us from his displeasure, amin.  Is this evidence that brothers should patient with their wives all the time, and not divorce them? 
I have heard that the Messenger of Allah, (pbuh), divorced women. What is the difference between keeping a woman with bad behavior and counseling her, and getting rid of a woman with bad behavior?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Undoubtedly 
          the wives of Nooh and Loot (peace be upon them) will enter Hell with 
          those who will enter it, but they did not commit any obvious sin that 
          would imply kufr, otherwise it would not have been permissible for these 
          Prophets to have remained married to kaafir women, because Allaah says 
          (interpretation of the meaning): 
“… 
          Likewise hold not the disbelieving women as wives” [al-Mumtahanah 60:10] 
Perhaps 
          the wife of Nooh was concealing kufr, or perhaps, despite the fact that 
          Nooh had been calling people to Allaah for so long, she was influenced 
          by the call of her people when she saw that all of her people were following 
          kufr, so she became doubtful and wondered how he alone could be a believer 
          when all of these people were disbelievers, and they formed the majority 
          of their nation. So her kufr may have been secret. The same applies 
          to the wife of Loot, of whom they said that her only sin was that she 
          told her people about his guests, i.e., she called them to come and 
          commit obscene actions with them. This was her sin, but it is possible 
          that she was also a kaafir in secret. Hence Allaah said (interpretation 
          of the meaning): 
“… 
          except his wife, she will be of those who remain behind” [al-‘Ankaboot 
          29:32] 
This 
          is a summary of the response given by Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Jibreen, 
          may Allaah preserve him. 
It 
          is permissible for a husband to divorce his wife so long as there is 
          a shar’i reason for doing so, such as a lack of religious commitment, 
          a bad attitude, lack of chastity, negligence, etc., even if she is not 
          a kaafir. But if she is a righteous believer, let him keep her, even 
          if he dislikes some of her characteristics, as the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said. It was narrated that 
          Abu Hurayrah said: the Messenger of Allaah  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Let not a believing 
          man hate a believing woman. If he dislikes one of her attributes, he 
          will be pleased with another.” (Narrated by Muslim from Abu Hurayrah, 
          1469). 
When 
          the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
          of Allaah be upon him) wanted to divorce Hafsah, Allaah revealed to 
          him: Go back to Hafsah, for she fasts a lot and prays a lot at night, 
          and she will be your wife in Paradise. Al-Mundhiri said: this was narrated 
          by al-Nasaa’i and Ibn Maajah. ‘Awn 
          al-Ma’bood Sharh Sunan Abi Dawood, hadeeth no. 2283. 
The husband has to strive to reform his 
          wife and pray to Allaah to reform her. Allaah will reform a wife in 
          whom there is some crookedness, if He wills, as He said concerning His 
          slave Zakariya (interpretation of the meaning):
“… 
          and [We] cured his wife for him…” [al-Anbiya’ 
          21:90] 
 Some 
          of the mufassireen (commentators) said that she used to have a sharp 
          tongue, i.e., her speech towards her husband was offensive, so Allaah 
          reformed her.
 A 
          man may put up with the difficulty of keeping his wife in order to ward 
          off a greater difficulty, which is that of separating the children and 
          dividing the family. But if the harm caused by staying with one’s wife 
          is greater than the harm caused by separating from her, there is nothing 
          wrong with him divorcing her. And Allaah is the Source of strength.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

But I have a little problem...that problem has to do with slight, doubtful, and irregular impotence. And I keep thinking that if I do get married that my future wife would not accept that. That may cause a divorce. What are the best things to do? And should I get married, or not?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The nature 
    of human beings is that there are great differences among them with regard 
    to sexual desire. Some of them have strong desires, some have less than 
    that, to a greater or lesser extent, and there are some who have no desire 
    at all. If you have any desire at all, even if it is little, then you may 
    get married; it is sufficient for you to be able to have intercourse, even

Is this the correct understanding to get, if not how should one go about choosing an opinion to follow?",,,"Praise be to Allah. It is not right for a Muslim to choose 
          the easiest opinion, because in this way he will get out of the obligations 
          of sharee’ah, or most of them, because in most matters – apart from 
          the basic principles of Islam – there are differences of opinion. In 
          the past, they used to say that the one who follows the rukhsah (dispensation, 
          easy option) has become a heretic. It is obligatory to choose the scholarly 
          opinion which is most correct according to the daleel (evidence), if

10646,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10646,The difference between Waqf and Endowment/trust fund,"I would like to know what is  waqf and the differences between islamic waqf and endowment or trust fund used in the west. to what extent can waqf benefit the non-muslims. for example can we give scholarships using waqf fund on them?  do you think waqf can be part of economic system or alternative to help muslim countries for their economic growth?  in your expert opinion, what are the potential problems or hurdles that should be considered in developing waqf?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Waqf means freezing the capital or property, and not disposing of it by selling, giving or inheriting, or in any other way, so that any income or earnings are to be disposed of in the manner dictated by the person who initiated the waqf, for charitable purposes and the like.
A gift or bequest means giving up possession of some wealth to someone who will benefit from it and who has full power of disposal over it.
In the case of waqf, the best is to use it for charitable purposes. If it is used for the purpose of calling non-Muslims to Islam, if there is the hope that they will enter Islam and it is most likely that they will do so, there is nothing wrong with that, because if the obligatory zakaah money may be used to soften people’s hearts towards Islam, then it is more apt that the money derived from waqf should be used for this purpose. But it is better to use it in charitable projects, because the benefit from them is certain rather than merely hoped for.
 Waqf may be used to energize the Islamic economic system, so that waqf funds may be disposed of in ways that are permitted by sharee’ah in order to promote the growth of the Islamic economic system.
 Any problems that may be expected with regard to waqf come from the heirs and relatives, and the way in which the profits should be distributed among the needy.",‘Abd al-Kareem al-Khudayr
10667,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10667,It is part of the Sunnah to turn one’s face towards the khateeb and look at him,"During the Friday khutbah, some of the worshippers look at the khateeb; some look straight ahead; some look at the ground; and some close their eyes. Is there a specific Sunnah regarding this matter?",,,"Praise be to Allah.It was narrated in a saheeh hadeeth that one of the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) mounted the minbar, we would turn our faces towards him.
(al-Silsilat al_Saheehah by al-Albani, no. 2080) 
It was narrated that Abaan ibn ‘Abd-Allah al-Bajili said: I saw ‘Udayy ibn Thaabit turning to face the imam when he stood to deliver the khutbah. I said to him, I saw you turn your face towards the imam. He said, I saw the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) doing that. 
It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ood said: when the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) mounted the minbar, we would turn our faces towards him him. This was narrated by al-Tirmidhi, who said, in the same chapter there are reports narrated from Ibn ‘Umar and Muhammad ibn al-Fadl. According to the scholars among the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and others, this is to be followed. They regard it as mustahabb to turn to face the imam when he delivers the khutbah. This is the view of Sufyaan al-Thawri, al-Shaafa’i, Ahmad and Ishaaq. 
It was narrated that Yahyaa ibn Sa’eed al-Ansaari said: “The Sunnah when the imam sits on the minbar on Friday is for all the people to turn their faces towards him.” 
It was narrated from Naafi’ that Ibn ‘Umar used to finish his tasbeeh before the imam came out; when he came out, he would turn to face him before the imam even sat down. 
Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) compiled these ahaadeeth in al-Silsilat al-Saheehah, no. 2080, and commented on them. 
It was narrated that Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sat on the minbar and we sat around him.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 921)
Al-Bukhaari narrated the hadeeth in “Chapter: The imam facing the people, and the people turning their faces towards the imam when he delivers the khutbah, and Ibn ‘Umar and Anas (may Allah be pleased with them) turning their faces towards the imam.” 
The point of the hadeeth is that the fact that they sat around him to listen to his words implies that they were looking at him in most cases. This is not affected by what was said earlier about the khateeb standing during the khutbah, because this implies that he used to speak whilst he was sitting in a high place and they were sitting at a lower point. If that was the case at times other than the khutbah, then it is more appropriate to do that at the time of the khutbah because there is the command to listen to it attentively.   
He said: 
“One of the reasons for their turning their faces towards the imam is to facilitate their listening to his words, and to observe good manners when listening to him. If a person turn his face towards him with the proper physical posture and a focused mind, that will better enable them to understand his preaching and is in accordance with the reason why the khateeb is commanded to stand.”

10668,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10668,Taking pictures for memories,"Some people say taking pictures and keeping them at home is haram, is this true?. Because in N. America and Europe for example we heard every day a missing children and with out their recent picture it is difficult to trace them, so could you explain to me what kind of pictures is haram and what kind is not haram, because I like to take pictures from my children just for memory and I keep them at home, am I commiting a sin, please specify for me and give me some daliil.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The basic principle concerning making pictures of any animate being, whether it is a human or any animal, is that it is haram, whether the pictures are three-dimensional or are drawn on paper, cloth or walls, etc., or are photographs (taken with a camera), because of the reports in the saheeh ahaadeeth which state that that is not allowed, and threaten the one who does that with a painful torment, and because they may lead to shirk in the form of standing respectfully before them, humbling oneself before them, drawing close to them and venerating them in a manner that is only befitting for Allah. They are also forbidden because this is a kind of trying to match the creation of Allah, and because of the temptation inherent in some of them, such as pictures of actresses and naked women, and so-called beauty queens. 
Among the ahaadeeth which state that this is haram and that it is a major sin is the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him), who said, “I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: ‘Whoever makes an image in this world will be told to breathe the soul into it on the Day of Resurrection, and he will never be able to do that.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim). He [Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him)] also narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Every image-maker will be in the Fire, and every image that he made will be made to appear to him and will torment him in Hell.” Ibn ‘Abbaas said: “If you must do that, then make trees and things that have no soul.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim). The general meaning of the ahaadeeth is that it is absolutely forbidden to make images of anything that has a soul.""(Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 1/456-457 )
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said, when he was asked about pictures: making pictures for this purpose is haram and is not permitted. That is because making pictures for memories is haram, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “The angels do not enter any house in which there is an image,” (narrated by al-Bukhaari, Bid’ al-Khalq, 2986), and whatever the angels do not enter had no goodness in it.""(

10669,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10669,The superiority of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to all of creation,I believe for sure that Rasulu'LLah Muhammad(swa) Is the best of all the prophets(asw) . But is there any envidence in the Quran or Sunna to support this ? There is an aya in quran which says 'we(i) don't diffetiance(nufariq) amoung them(the prophets).,,,"Praise be to Allah.(1)Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“We make no distinction between one another of His Messengers” [al-Baqarah 2:285].
Ibn Katheer said in his Tafseer of this aayah:
The believers believe in all the Prophets and Messengers, and the books revealed from heaven to the slaves of Allah, the Messengers and Prophets; they do not differentiate between any of them, believing in some and rejecting others. Rather they regard all of them as truthful, righteous, rightly-guided and guiding to the path of goodness, even though some of them abrogated the laws of others, until all of them were abrogated by the sharee’ah of Muhammad, the Seal of the Prophets and Messengers, upon whose sharee’ah the Hour will cone.(Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 1/736)
With regard to the superiority of some of the Prophets over one another, Allah has told us of this, when He said (interpretation of the meaning):
“Those Messengers! We preferred some of them to others; to some of them Allah spoke (directly); others He raised to degrees (of honour)”[al-Baqarah 2:253]
Allah tells us that some of them are several degrees above others, hence the chosen ones among the Messengers are “those of strong will”. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And (remember) when We took from the Prophets their covenant, and from you (O Muhammad), and from Nooh (Noah), Ibraaheem (Abraham), Moosaa (Moses), and ‘Eesa (Jesus) son of Maryam (Mary). We took from them a strong covenant”[al-Ahzaab 33:7]
And Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the best of them. This is indicated by the fact that he was their imaam on the night of the Mi’raaj, because no one but the best is put forward. More evidence that he is the best of them comes from Abu Hurayrah, who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘I will be the leader of the sons of Adam on the Day of Resurrection, and the first one for whom the grave will be opened, and the first to intercede, and the first whose intercession will be accepted.’”
(Narrated by Muslim, al-Fadaa’il, 4223)
Al-Nawawi said in his commentary on Saheeh Muslim:
The phrase “I will be the leader of the sons of Adam on the Day of Resurrection and the first one for whom the grave will be opened, and the first to intercede, and the first whose intercession will be accepted”: al-Harawi said: the leader (sayyid) is the one who surpasses his people in goodness. Someone else said: He is the one to whom they turn at times of calamity and hardship, so he takes care of them, carries their burdens and protects them.
The phrase “the Day of Resurrection” – even though he is their leader in this world and in the Hereafter. The reason for this specific mention is that on the Day of Resurrection his position of leadership will become apparent to everyone, and there will no longer be anyone who disputes or stubbornly rejects it, unlike the case in this world when the kings of the kuffaar and the leaders of the mushrikeen competed with him. The scholars said, he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not say ““I will be the leader of the sons of Adam” out of pride. Indeed, that is clearly stated in the famous hadith narrated by compilers other than Muslim: “I will be the leader of the sons of Adam, and I am not boasting.” Rather, he said it for two reasons. The first was in obedience to the command of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): “And proclaim the Grace of your Lord”, and the second was that it was part of the message that he was commanded to convey in totality to his ummah so that they would acknowledge his status and believe in him, and do as he commanded, and respect him (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) as required by his status and as Allah commanded them. This hadith implies that he is superior to all of creation, because the view of Ahl al-Sunnah is that human beings, i.e., the people of obedience and piety, are superior to the angels, and he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is superior to human beings and to others. With regard to the other hadith – “Do not differentiate between the Prophets” – it may be responded to in five ways. The first is that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said this before he knew that he was the leader of the sons of Adam; then when he came to know he spoke of it. The second is that he said it out of politeness and humility. The third is that the prohibition refers to the kind of differentiation that leads to undermining the position of the one who is less preferred. The fourth is that the prohibition applies to the kind of differentiation that leads to dispute and fitnah (tribulation), as is well known in the reason for the hadith. The fifth is that the prohibition applies only in the case of prophethood itself, not to superiority within the ranks of the Prophets; rather, it applies to superiority in characteristics and other virtues, so it is essential to believe in that. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Those Messengers! We preferred some of them to others…” [al-Baqarah 2:253]
And Allah knows best.
The characteristics of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) confirm that he is superior to the rest of the Messengers. We will mention some of them which are narrated in the Qur’aan and Sunnah:
Allah has singled out the Qur’aan, to the exclusion of other Books, to be preserved. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Qur’aan) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption)” [al-Hijr 15:9]
In the case of the other Books, Allah entrusted their protection to their people. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning]
“Verily, We did send down the Tawraat (Torah) [to Moosa (Moses)], therein was guidance and light, by which the Prophets, who submitted themselves to Allah’s Will, judged for the Jews. And the rabbis and the priests [too judged for the Jews by the Tawraat (Torah) after those Prophets], for to them was entrusted the protection of Allah’s Book, and they were witnesses thereto [al-Maa’idah 5:44]
He is the Seal of the Prophets and Messengers. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but he is the Messenger of Allah and the last (end) of the Prophets” [al-Ahzaab 33:40]
He is unique in that he was sent to all of mankind. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Blessed be He Who sent down the criterion (of right and wrong, i.e. this Qur’aan) to His slave (Muhammad) that he may be a warner to the ‘Aalameen (mankind and jinn)” [al-Furqaan 25:1]
Among his unique characteristics in the Hereafter:
He will be the owner of the “position of praise and glory (al-maqaam al-mahmood)” on the Day of Resurrection. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And in some parts of the night (also) offer the Salaah (prayer) with it (i.e. recite the Qur’aan in the prayer) as an additional prayer (Tahajjud optional prayer Nawaafil) for you (O Muhammad). It may be that your Lord will raise you to Maqaam Mahmood (a station of praise and glory, i.e., the honour of intercession on the Day of Resurrection)” [al-Israa’ 17:78]
Ibn Jareer said: most of the commentators said that is the position which he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) will occupy in order to intercede for the people on the Day of Resurrection, to ask that their Lord might grant them respite from the great hardship that they are suffering on this Day.” (Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 5/103)
And he will be the leader of all of mankind on the Day of Resurrection, as stated in the hadith quoted above.
He will be the first one to cross al-Siraat with his ummah. Al-Bukhaari narrated a lengthy hadith concerning that from Abu Hurayrah, in which it says, “… and I will be the first one among the Messengers to lead his ummah across it.” (al-Adhaan, 764).
 Another indication that he is the best of the Prophets is the fact that they will not intercede, rather one of them will refer the people to another, until ‘Eesa refers them to Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). He will say, “I (will do it),” then he will step forward to intercede for everyone, and the first and the last will praise him for that, the Prophets and the rest of mankind.
 His unique characteristics, as mentioned in the ayaat and saheeh ahaadeeth, are too many to mention in this brief summary; entire books have been written on this topic.
 See Kitaab Khasaa’is al-Mustafa (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) bayna al-Ghulw wa’l-Jafaa’ by al-Saadiq ibn Muhammad, 33-79
 To sum up, we prefer our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) over all the other Prophets and over all of mankind, because of the evidence that has been narrated concerning that, whilst also respecting the rights of the other Prophets and Messengers and believing in them and respecting them.

What are the things that I am not allowed to do?,,,"Praise be to Allah.It is narrated in the hadeeth that a recently widowed woman is not allowed to do five things, and that she is required to do five things.
1 – She should stay in her house where she was living when her husband died; this is the place where she should stay until the end of her ‘iddah, which lasts for four months and ten days, unless she is pregnant, in which case her ‘iddah ends when she gives birth, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And for those who are pregnant (whether they are divorced or their husbands are dead), their ‘Iddah (prescribed period) is until they lay down their burden” [al-Talaaq 65:4]
She should not leave the house except in case of need or necessity, such as going to the hospital if she is sick or to buy things she needs from the marketplace such as food etc., if she does not have someone with her who can do that. If the house is destroyed, then she should move elsewhere, or if she does not have anyone to keep her company and she fears for her safety, then it is OK for her to leave if there is a need to do so.
2 – She should not wear beautiful clothes, yellow, red, etc. Rather she should wear clothes that are not beautiful, whether they are black or green, etc. What matters is that the clothes should not be beautiful, as this is the command of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).
3 – She should avoid wearing jewellery of gold, silver, diamonds, pearls and the like, whether that is necklaces, bracelets or rings, etc., until her ‘iddah is over.
4 – She should avoid wearing perfume; she should avoid perfuming herself with bukhoor (incense) or any other kind of perfume, except when she purifies herself following her period, in which case she may perfume herself with a little bukhoor.
5 – She should avoid kohl; she may not apply kohl or any similar kind of cosmetic that is used on the face, the kind of cosmetic that may attract people to her. But with regard to regular beautification by using soap and water, that is OK.  But the kohl which is used to make the eyes look beautiful and other kinds of cosmetics which some women use on their faces. This should not be done.
These are the five things which must be taken care of in the case of a woman whose husband dies.
But with regard to what some of the common people think and have fabricated, that a recently-widowed woman should not speak to anyone or speak on the telephone, or that she should take a bath no more than once a week, or that she should not walk barefoot in the house, or go outside in the moonlight, and other similar myths, there is no basis for these things. She may walk in her house barefoot or wearing shoes; she may do what she needs to in her house, cooking food for herself and her guests; she may walk in the moonlight in the courtyard and garden of her house; she may take a bath whenever she wants; she may speak to whomever she wants in a manner that is not suspicious; she may shake hands with other women and with her mahrams, but not with non-mahrams; she may take off her khimaar (head cover) if there are no non-mahrams present. But she should not use henna or saffron or perfume, either on her clothes or in coffee, because saffron is a kind of perfume. No one should propose marriage to her, but it is OK to hint, but clearly proposing marriage is not allowed. And Allah is the Source of help.

Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz was asked a similar question, and he said:
“It is not permissible for a Muslim to touch the Quran when he does not have wudu, according to the majority of scholars. This is the view of the four imams (may Allah be pleased with them), and this was the view expressed in the fatwas of the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).
A sahih hadith concerning that has been narrated from ‘Amr ibn Hazm (may Allah be pleased with him), stating that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wrote to the people of Yemen: “No one should touch the Quran except one who is tahir (pure).” This is a jayyid hadith which has a number of other isnads which strengthen it.
Hence it is known that it is not permissible to touch the Quran except in a state of purity from both major and minor impurity. 
The same applies to moving it from place to place, if the person who is moving it is not tahir. 
But if he touches it or moves it with something in between, such as picking it up in a wrapper, then it is OK. 
But if he touches it directly when he is not tahir, this is not permitted according to the sahih view of the majority of scholars, for the reasons stated above.
With regard to reciting it, it is OK for him to recite it from memory when he is without wudu, or for him to read it if the Quran is held by someone who asks him to correct or prompt him.
But the person who is junub, i.e., in a state of major impurity, should not recite Quran, because it was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that nothing ever kept him from reciting Quran except for janabah (major impurity). 
Ahmad narrated with a sahih isnad from ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came out from the toilet and recited something from the Quran. He said, “This is for the one who is not junub; but the one who is junub should not do this, not even one ayah.”
The point is that the one who is junub should not recite Quran either from the Mus-haf or from memory, until he has taken a bath (ghusl). But the one who has broken his wudu and is impure in the sense of minor impurity may recite Quran from memory but he should not touch the Mus-haf.” (Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him), 10/150)
Interpreting hadith on purity of the believers
With regard to the hadith about the purity of the believer, Abu Hurayrah said: “I was met by the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and I was junub. He took my hand and I walked with him until he sat down. Then I slipped away and washed myself (ghusl), then I came to where he was sitting. He said, ‘Where were you, O Abu Hurayrah’? I told him, and he said, ‘Subhan-Allaah, O Abu Hurayrah!, the believer does not become impure.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, al-Ghusl, 276; Muslim, al-Hayd, 556)
Al-Nawawi said in his Commentary on Sahih Muslim:
“This hadith illustrates a great principle that the Muslim is tahir whether he is alive or dead. If his purity is established, then his sweat, saliva and tears are all pure too, whether he (or she) is without wudu, in a state of major impurity (junub), menstruating or bleeding after childbirth.” 
Once this is understood, then the meaning of his being pure (tahir) will become clear. It means that there is nothing to prevent his body from being essentially pure even when at the same time he has broken his wudu, because being without wudu is simply something that prevents one from praying, or doing other things for which taharah (purity) is a pre-condition.

10673,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10673,Settling of scores among the animals on the Day of Resurrection,"I have heard that there will be a settling of scores among the animals on the Day of Resurrection. Is this true? If it is true, how will that be done if they are not accountable?",,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          It was narrated from the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) – in a hadeeth that has 
          many corroborating reports and isnaads – that he said: “Allaah will 
          judge between His creation, jinn, men and animals. On that Day, Allaah 
          will let the hornless animal settle its score with the horned until, 
          when there is nothing left to be settled, Allaah will say to them, ‘Be 
          dust.’ At that point the kaafir will say, ‘Would that I were dust.’” 
 
          (Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in  
          al-Silsilat al-Saheehah, no. 1966) 
 
          Among the versions of this hadeeth which we may mention 
          are the following:
 
          ·“All creatures will settle 
          the scores between them, even the hornless animal with the horned one, 
          and even one ant with another)
 
          ·It was narrated from Abu 
          Dharr that the Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was sitting, and two sheep 
          locked horns until one of them defeated and subdued the other. The Messenger 
          of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) smiled and someone asked 
          him, “Why are you smiling, O Messenger of Allaah?”  He said, “It 
          is amazing. By the One in Whose hand is my soul, their score will be 
          settled on the Day of Resurrection.”
 
          ·“O Abu Dharr, do you know 
          what they are fighting over?” He said, “No.” He said, “But Allaah knows 
          and He will judge between them.” 
 
          Al-Nawawi said in Sharh Muslim, 
          under the hadeeth of al-tarjumah: 
 
          “This clearly indicates that the animals will be gathered 
          on the Day of Resurrection and that they will be resurrected on the 
          Day of Resurrection like humans who are accountable, and as children, 
          the insane, and those whom the call did not reach will also be resurrected. 
          There is also evidence in the Qur’aan and Sunnah to support that. Allaah 
          says (interpretation of the meaning):
 
          “And when the wild beasts shall be gathered 
          together”
 
          [al-Takweer 81:5]
 
          If there is a phrase in a text of sharee’ah whose apparent 
          meaning is not impossible whether according to sharee’ah or reason, 
          then it must be interpreted according to its apparent meaning. The scholars 
          said: reward and punishment are not essential features of the gathering 
          and the resurrection. The settling of scores between the hornless and 
          horned animals is not based on accountability, because they are not 
          held accountable, rather it is retaliation in kind for the sake of justice. 
          And Allaah knows best.”
 
          Shaykh ‘Ali al-Qaari quoted him in  
          al-Murqaah (4/761) as saying: 
 
          “If it is said that a sheep is not accountable, how can 
          scores be settled with it? (Our response is) that Allaah does as He 
          wills, and He cannot be questioned as to what He does. The point is 
          to demonstrate to people that rights will not be neglected, rather the 
          rights of the oppressed will be settled at the expense of the oppressor”
 
          al-Qaari’ said: “This is a good point. 
          The point is that this settling of scores points in the most eloquent 
          manner to the perfect justice with which all those who are accountable 
          will be dealt. If this is the situation with regard to animals who are 
          not accountable, then how about those who possess reason, lowly and 
          noble, strong and weak?”

          knowledge mentioned here is the knowledge of sharee’ah which is derived 
          from the Qur’aan and Sunnah. This is the legacy of the Prophets, for 
          the Prophets did not leave behind dirhams and dinars (money), rather 
          they only left behind knowledge. Whoever learns it gains a great deal. 
          When the texts commend knowledge, what is meant is knowledge of the 
          Qur’aan, Sunnah and sharee’ah. This also includes knowledge of nahw 
          (grammar), i.e., the Arabic language, because it is the language of 
          the Qur’aan: knowledge of how inheritances are to be shared out (faraa’id); 
          acts of worship (‘ibaadaat); interactions with others (mu’aamalaat); 
          punishments prescribed in sharee’ah (hudood); the shar’i literature 
          and Arabic literature, for it is the biography of the close friends 
          (awliya’) of Allaah and His righteous slaves. Similarly it is important 
          to know the means to this knowledge, such as Usool al-Fiqh, tawheed, 
          ‘Aqeedah, the basic principles of Islam, etc. With regard to other, 
          worldly sciences which the Muslims need to know, there is no doubt that 
          they come under the heading of fard kifaayah (communal obligation, i.e., 
          if some of the community does it, the rest are absolved of the obligation); 
          those who are able to learn them are obliged to do so, thus fulfilling 
          the obligation of fard kifaayah, because the people are in need of that, 
          so long as that does not prevent them from learning the things that 
          they are obliged to know. Undoubtedly there is benefit in sciences such 
          as biology, chemistry, etc. Many of the scholars were of the view that 
          it is obligatory to learn necessary crafts and industries, and there 
          should be enough people who have these skills, such as blacksmiths,

10678,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10678,Disadvantages of limiting oneself only to books,What is the way to gain knowledge? What are the obstacles faced by the seeker of knowledge?,,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          There are two ways of acquiring knowledge: 
 
          1 – Acquiring it from trustworthy books, 
          which have been written by scholars who are known for their knowledge 
          and trustworthiness and whose ‘aqeedah (belief) is known to be free 
          of innovations (bid’ah) and myths. 
 
          Taking knowledge from books can help 
          a person to reach a certain level, but there are two obstacles: 
 
          The first obstacle is that this takes 
          a long time, because one needs a lot of time and a lot of painstaking 
          effort until he gets the knowledge he wants. Many people may not be 
          able to overcome this obstacle, especially when they see that those 
          around them have wasted their time without gaining anything, so they 
          get bored and tired, then they do not get what they want. 
 
          The second obstacle is that the knowledge 
          of the person who acquires knowledge from books is usually weak, because 
          it is not built on a solid foundation. Hence we find many mistakes made 
          by those who take their knowledge from books, because they have no guidelines 
          or principles with which to deal with minor issues referred to in the 
          Qur’aan and Sunnah. We find some people come across a hadeeth which 
          is not mentioned in the reliable books of Saheeh and Musnad, and this 
          method goes against the principles followed by the scholars and indeed 
          by the ummah, then they take this hadeeth and build their belief on 
          it. Undoubtedly this is wrong, because the Qur’aan and Sunnah have principles 
          around which the minor issues revolve, and if there is something that 
          contradicts these principles and cannot be reconciled with them, then 
          that should be abandoned.  
 
          2 – One of the ways of gaining knowledge is to learn 
          from a scholar who is trustworthy with regard to his knowledge and his 
          religious commitment. This way is quicker and is more reliable, because 
          in the first method the seeker of knowledge may go astray without realizing 
          it, either because of misunderstanding or because he is lacking in knowledge, 
          or for some other reason. But in the second method he can discuss, give 
          and take with his teacher, which will open to the student many doors 
          to understanding and examining, how to defend the correct views and 
          refute weak views.  The student should prioritize and read book 
          which summarize knowledge before studying it in depth. In this manner 
          he will progress gradually. He should not move on to the next level 
          before he has thoroughly grasped the current level; in this way his 
          progress will be sound.","From Fataawa al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, Kitaab al-‘Ilm, p. 68-70"

Should I bury him and arrange his funeral? Should I wash him and shroud him or not? Are there any rights that my father has over me in this respect?,,,"Praise be to Allah.It was narrated in a saheeh hadeeth that Naajiyah ibn Ka’b narrated that ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), ‘Your old, misguided uncle has died (he was referring to his father Abu Taalib). Who will bury him?’ He said, ‘Go and bury your father.’ [I] said, ‘I will not bury him, for he died as a mushrik.’ He said, ‘Go and bury him, then do not do anything until you come to me.’ So I went and buried him, then I came to him with traces of dust and earth on me. He told me to wash myself, then he made du’aa’ for me in words that were more precious to me than everything on earth.”
(al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, by al-Albaani, no. 161) 
The Shaykh said, commenting on this hadeeth: 
1 – It is allowed for the Muslim to take care of the burial of his mushrik relatives. That does not cancel out his hatred of their shirk. Do you not see that ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) initially refused to bury his father for that very reason, as he said, “he died as a mushrik.” He thought that if he buried him when this was the case, that this was included in the forbidden kind of friendship as referred to in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Take not as friends the people who incurred the Wrath of Allah”
[al-Mumtahinah 60:13]
When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) repeated the command to bury his father, he hastened to obey him and he gave up the notion that had initially occurred to him. This is what obedience means: that a person gives up his opinion in response to the command of his Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). It seems to me that a son’s burying his mushrik father or mother is the last act of good companionship that the son can do for his mushrik parent in this world. But after the burial, he cannot make du’aa’ for him or pray for forgiveness for him, because of the unambiguous words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning):
“It is not (proper) for the Prophet and those who believe to ask Allah’s forgiveness for the Mushrikoon, even though they be of kin”
[al-Tawbah 9:113]
If this is the case, then how can people pray for mercy and forgiveness in the pages of newspapers and magazines for some of the kuffaar, in death announcements for money! Let the one who has any concern for his hereafter fear Allah.
2 – It is not prescribed for him to wash or shroud a kaafir, or to offer the funeral prayer over him, even if he was a relative, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not tell ‘Ali to do that. If that were permissible, he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would have said so, because it is well known that it is not permitted for the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to delay explaining something at the time when that information is needed. This is the view of the Hanbalis and others. 
3 – It is not prescribed for the relatives of a mushrik to follow his funeral, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not do that in the case of his uncle, although he was the one who was the most kind and compassionate towards him, and he even prayed to Allah to make his punishment the lightest punishment in Hell. 
In all of that there is a lesson for those who are deceived by pride in their lineage and who do not strive for their Hereafter with their Lord. Allah indeed spoke the truth when He said (interpretation of the meaning):
“there will be no kinship among them that Day, nor will they ask of one another”

(h)The wife should treat her husband in a good manner","Praise be to Allah.Islam has enjoined upon the husband duties towards his wife, and vice versa, and among these duties are some which are shared by both husband and wife.
We will mention – by the help of Allah – some of the texts of the Quran and Sunnah which have to do with the duties of the spouses towards one another, quoting also from the commentaries and views of the scholars.
Rights of wife in Islam
The wife has financial rights over her husband which are the mahr (dowry), spending and accommodation.
 And she has non-financial rights such as fair division between co-wives, being treated in a decent and reasonable manner, and not being treated in a harmful way by her husband.
1- Financial rights of the wife
 (a) The mahr (dowry) 
This is the money to which the wife is entitled from her husband when the marriage contract is completed or when the marriage is consummated. It is a right which the man is obliged to pay to the woman . Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And give to the women (whom you marry) their Mahr (obligatory bridal-money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage) with a good heart.” [al-Nisa 4:4]
The prescription of the mahr demonstrates the seriousness and importance of the marriage-contract, and is a token of respect and honour to the woman.
The mahr is not a condition or essential part of the marriage contract, according to the majority of jurists; rather it is one of the consequences of the contract. If the marriage contract is done without any mention of the mahr, it is still valid, according to the consensus of the majority, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“There is no sin on you, if you divorce women while yet you have not touched (had sexual relation with) them, nor appointed unto them their Mahr (bridal-money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage).” [al-Baqarah 2:236]
The fact that divorce is permitted before consummation of the marriage or before stipulating the mahr indicates that it is permissible not to stipulate the mahr in the marriage contract.
If the mahr is stipulated, it becomes obligatory upon the husband; if it is not stipulated, then he must give the mahr that is given to women of similar status to his wife. 
(b) Spending
The scholars of Islam are agreed that it is obligatory for husbands to spend on their wives, on the condition that the wife makes herself available to her husband. If she refuses him or rebels, then she is not entitled to that spending.
The reason why it is obligatory to spend on her is that the woman is available only to her husband, because of the marriage contract, and she is not allowed to leave the marital home except with his permission. So he has to spend on her and provide for her, and this is in return for her making herself available to him for his pleasure.
What is meant by spending is providing what the wife needs of food and accommodation. She has the right to these things even if she is rich, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“but the father of the child shall bear the cost of the mother’s food and clothing on a reasonable basis.” [al-Baqarah 2:233]
“Let the rich man spend according to his means; and the man whose resources are restricted, let him spend according to what Allah has given him.” [al-Talaq 65:7]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to Hind bint ‘Utbah – the wife of Abu Sufyan – who had complained that he did not spend on her: “Take what is sufficient for you and your children, on a reasonable basis.” 
‘Aishah said: “Hind bint ‘Utbah, the wife of Abu Sufyan, entered upon the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, Abu Sufyan is a stingy man who does not spend enough on me and my children, except for what I take from his wealth without his knowledge. Is there any sin on me for doing that?’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ‘Take from his wealth on a reasonable basis, only what is sufficient for you and your children.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5049; Muslim, 1714)
Jabir narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said in his Farewell Sermon:
“Fear Allah concerning women! Verily you have taken them on the security of Allah, and intercourse with them has been made lawful unto you by words of Allah. You too have rights over them, and that they should not allow anyone to sit on your bed [i.e., not let them into the house] whom you do not like. But if they do that, you can chastise them but not severely. Their rights upon you are that you should provide them with food and clothing in a fitting manner” (Narrated by Muslim, 1218)
(c) Accommodation
 This is also one of the wife’s rights, which means that her husband should prepare for her accommodation according to his means and ability. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Lodge them (the divorced women) where you dwell, according to your means.” [al-Talaq 65:6]
 2- Non-financial rights
(i) Fair treatment of co-wives 
One of the rights that a wife has over her husband is that she and her co-wives should be treated equally , if the husband has other wives, with regard to nights spent with them, spending and clothing.
(ii) Kind treatment
The husband must have a good attitude towards his wife and be kind to her, and offer her everything that may soften her heart towards him, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“…and live with them honourably.” [al-Nisa 4:19]
“And they (women) have rights (over their husbands as regards living expenses) similar (to those of their husbands) over them (as regards obedience and respect) to what is reasonable.” [al-Baqarah 2:228]
Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Be kind to women.’”(Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3153; Muslim, 1468).
How Prophet Muhammad treated his wives
There follow examples of the kind treatment of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) towards his wives – for he is the best example:
 1. Zaynab bint Abi Salamah narrated that Umm Salamah said: “I got my menses when I was lying with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) under a single woollen sheet. I slipped away and put on the clothes I usually wore for menstruation. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)  said to me, ‘Have you got your menses?’ I said, ‘Yes.’ Then he called me and made me lie with him under the same sheet.”
She said: And she told me that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to kiss her when he was fasting, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and I used to do ghusl to cleanse ourselves from janabah from one vessel.(Narrated by al-Bukhari, 316; Muslim, 296)
 2.  ‘Urwah ibn al-Zubayr said: “ ‘Aishah said: ‘By Allah, I saw the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) standing at the door of my apartment when the Abyssinians were playing with their spears in the Mosque of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). He covered me with his cloak so that I could watch their games, then he stood there for my sake until I was the one who had had enough. So you should appreciate the fact that young girls like to have fun.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 443; Muslim, 892)
 3.  ‘Aishah, the Mother of the Believers (may Allah be pleased with her), narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to pray sitting down; he would recite Quran when he was sitting down, then when there were thirty or forty ayahs left, he would stand up and recite them standing up. Then he did ruku’, then sujud; then he would do likewise in the second rak’ah. When he had finished his prayer, he would look, and if I was awake he would talk with me, and if I was asleep he would lie down. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1068)  
(c)  Not harming one’s wife 
This is one of the basic principles of Islam. Because harming others is haram in the case of strangers, it is even more so in the case of harming one’s wife.
 ‘Ubadah ibn al-Samit narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ruled, “There should be no harming nor reciprocating harm.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah,, 2340)
This hadith was classed as sahih by Imam Ahmad, al-Hakim, Ibn al-Salah and others. See Khulasat al-Badr al-Munir, 2/438.
 Among the things to which the Lawgiver drew attention in this matter is the prohibition of hitting or beating in a severe manner.
Jabir narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said in his Farewell Sermon:
“Fear Allah concerning women! Verily you have taken them on the security of Allah, and intercourse with them has been made lawful unto you by words of Allah. You too have rights over them, and that they should not allow anyone to sit on your bed [i.e., not let them into the house] whom you do not like. But if they do that, you can chastise them but not severely. Their rights upon you are that you should provide them with food and clothing in a fitting manner” (Narrated by Muslim, 1218)
 Rights of husband in Islam
 The rights of the husband over his wife are among the greatest rights; indeed his rights over her are greater than her rights over him, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And they (women) have rights (over their husbands as regards living expenses) similar (to those of their husbands) over them (as regards obedience and respect) to what is reasonable, but men have a degree (of responsibility) over them.” [al-Baqarah 2:228]
 al-Jassas said: Allah tells us in this verse that each of the spouses has rights over the other, and that the husband has one particular right over his wife which she does not have over him.
 Ibn al-‘Arabi said: this text states that he has some preference over her with regard to rights and duties of marriage.
 These rights include:
(a) The obligation of obedience 
Allah has made the man a qawwaam (protector and maintainer) of the woman by commanding, directing and taking care of her, just as guardians take care of their charges, by virtue of the physical and mental faculties that Allah has given only to men and the financial obligations that He has enjoined upon them. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means.” [al-Nisa 4:34]
‘Ali ibn Abi Talhah said, narrating from Ibn ‘Abbas: “Men are the protectors and maintainers of women” means, they are in charge of them, i.e., she should obey him in matters of obedience that Allah has enjoined upon her, and obey him by treating his family well and taking care of his wealth. This was the view of Muqatil, al-Suddi and al-Dahhak. (Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 1/492)
 (b) Making herself available to her husband
One of the rights that the husband has over his wife is that he should be able to enjoy her (physically). If he marries a woman and she is able to have intercourse, she is obliged to submit herself to him according to the contract, if he asks her. That is after he gives her the immediate mahr, and gives her some time – two or three days, if she asks for that – to sort herself out, because that is something that she needs, and because that is not too long and is customary. 
If a wife refuses to respond to her husband’s request for intercourse , she has done something haram and has committed a major sin, unless she has a valid shar’i excuse such as menses, obligatory fasting, sickness, etc.
Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘When a man calls his wife to his bed and she refuses, and he went to sleep angry with her, the angels will curse her until morning.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3065; Muslim, 1436)
(c) Not admitting anyone whom the husband dislikes
One of the rights that the husband has over his wife is that she should not permit anyone whom he dislikes to enter his house.
Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “It is not permitted for a woman to fast when her husband is present without his permission, or to admit anyone into his house without his permission. And whatever she spends (in charity) of his wealth without his consent, ….” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 4899; Muslim, 1026)
Sulaymaan ibn ‘Amr ibn al-Ahwas said: my father told me that he was present at the Farewell Pilgrimage (Hajjat al-Wada’) with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). He [the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)] praised and glorified Allah, then he preached a sermon and said: “Treat women kindly, for they are (as) prisoners and you have no other power over them than that, if they are guilty of open lewdness, then refuse to share their beds, and hit them, but not severely. But if they return to obedience, (then) do not seek means (of annoyance) against them. You have rights over your women and your women have rights over you. Your rights over your women are that they should not let anyone whom you dislike sit on your bed and they should not let anyone whom you dislike enter your house. Their rights over you are that you should feed and clothe them well.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1163 – he said this is a sahih hasan hadith. Also narrated by Ibn Majah, 1851) 
Jabir said: [the Prophet] (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:
“Fear Allah concerning women! Verily you have taken them on the security of Allah, and intercourse with them has been made lawful unto you by words of Allah. You too have rights over them, and that they should not allow anyone to sit on your bed [i.e., not let them into the house] whom you do not like. But if they do that, you can chastise them but not severely. Their rights upon you are that you should provide them with food and clothing in a fitting manner.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1218)
(d) Not going out of the house except with the husband’s permission
One of the rights of the husband over his wife is that she should not go out of the house except with his permission. 
The Shafi'is and Hanbalis said: she does not have the right to visit (even) her sick father except with the permission of her husband, and he has the right to prevent her from doing that… because obedience to the husband is obligatory, and it is not permitted to neglect an obligatory action for something that is not obligatory. 
(e) Discipline
The husband has the right to discipline his wife if she disobeys him in something good, not if she disobeys him in something sinful, because Allah has enjoined disciplining women by forsaking them in bed and by hitting them (lightly and if there is any benefit in that), when they do not obey. 
The Hanafis mentioned four situations in which a husband is permitted to discipline his wife by hitting her (lightly). These are: not adorning herself when he wants her to; not responding when he calls her to bed and she is tahirah (pure, i.e., not menstruating); not praying; and going out of the house without his permission. 
The evidence that it is permissible to discipline one's wife includes the ayahs (interpretation of the meaning):
“As to those women on whose part you see ill-conduct, admonish them (first), (next) refuse to share their beds, (and last) beat them (lightly, if it is useful).” [al-Nisa 4:34]
“O you who believe! Ward off yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones.” [al-Tahrim 66:6]
Ibn Kathir said:
Qatadah said: “You should command them to obey Allah, and forbid them to disobey Allah; you should be in charge of them in accordance with the command of Allah, and instruct them to follow the commands of Allah, and help them to do so. If you see any act of disobedience towards Allah, then stop them from doing it and rebuke them for that. 
This was also the view of al-Dahhak and Muqatil: that the duty of the Muslim is to teach his family, including his relatives and his slaves, that which Allah has enjoined upon them and that which He has forbidden them.” (Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 4/392) 
(f) The wife serving her husband 
There is a great deal of evidence (dalil) for this, some of which has been mentioned above.
 Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said:
She is obliged to serve her husband according to what is reasonable among people of similar standing. That varies according to circumstances: the way in which a Bedouin woman serves (her husband) will not be like the way of a town-dweller, and the way of a strong woman will not be like the way of a weak woman. (al-Fatawa al-Kubra, 4/561) 
(g) Submitting herself to him
Once the conditions of the marriage contract have been fulfilled and it is valid, then the woman is obliged to submit herself to her husband and allow him to enjoy her (physically). This is because once the contract is completed, he is allowed in return to enjoy her, and the wife is entitled to the compensation which is the mahr. 
(h)The wife should treat her husband in a good manner
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And they (women) have rights (over their husbands as regards living expenses) similar (to those of their husbands) over them (as regards obedience and respect) to what is reasonable.” [al-Baqarah 2:228]
 Al-Qurtubi said:
“It was also narrated from him – i.e., Ibn 'Abbas – that this means: they have the right to good companionship and kind and reasonable treatment from their husbands just as they are obliged to obey the commands of their husbands.
 And it was said that they have the right that their husbands should not harm them, and their husbands have a similar right over them. This was the view of al-Tabari. 
Ibn Zayd said: You should fear Allah concerning them just as they should fear Allah concerning you. 
The meanings are similar, and the ayah includes all of that in the rights and duties of marriage.” (Tafsir al-Qurtubi, 3/123-124)

I was intending to propose to her; I had asked about her, and I liked her and had become very attracted to her, but he beat me to it. I cannot forget this woman. I know that it is not permissible to propose to her when a Muslim brother has already proposed, as it says in the hadeeth. Will it solve the problem if I ask his permission to propose marriage to this woman, and explain my situation to him and get his permission?",,,"Praise be to Allah. Yes,

10682,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10682,Problems in the administration committee of one of the mosques,"We have a small  Mosque ( Inside a House ) in our Town .We also have a land and some money to build a new Mosque witch was collected over the years for that purpose. We have a Mosque Committee elected yearly as well as  Five member Permanent Board of Trustee, This Board was appointed 6-8 years ago when there were very few muslims in this town, Some of the members of Trustee who have left the town were replaced by the some members of Board of Trustee without holding any elections and obviously they have given these posts to the persons of their own choice, since than this Board of Trustee has virtually ruled this mosque because they have formed the constitution of the mosque according to their own convenience  e.g., They only allow  those members of the mosque to vote for committee who have been living in this town for more than  3 years, in that way only their approved persons could contest and vote in  the election and people were seeing the same faces for years. About a year ago because of the pressures they allowed everybody to vote and in that way a new committee was elected. 
After that elections it was revealed that the money for the new mosque has been put in a Saving Account which is drawing  Interest ( Riba ) . Initially The Board Of Trustee   ( from whom only 1-2 comes regularly to the Mosque  unfortunately  ) who are the ones to operate the account denied that we are getting  Riba , than the active member of the Board who is wealthy and influential person of the town accepted that they have put the money in that account because they have Fatwa  from  Al Azhar that getting Riba in USA Banks is allowed",,,"Praise be to Allah.We

10683,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10683,He is confused about the meaning of this verse,"I would like to know the commentary on the following verse (interpretation of the meaning): 

“(Remember) when the angels said: ‘O Maryam (Mary)! Verily, Allaah gives you the glad tidings of a Word [“Be!” — and he was! i.e. ‘Eesa (Jesus) the son of Maryam (Mary)] from Him, his name will be the Messiah ‘Eesa (Jesus), the son of Maryam (Mary), held in honour in this world and in the Hereafter, and will be one of those who are near to Allaah’”

[Aal ‘Imraan 3:45].  

Does the phrase “a word from Him” mean a spirit from Him, as the Christians claim?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
      May Allaah help us and you to do that which He loves and 
      which pleases Him. The difference between the guidance and true religion 
      that Allaah has revealed in His Book and what the Christians say about the 
      Prophet of Allaah ‘Eesa (Jesus – peace be upon him) is the difference 
      between faith and disbelief (kufr), between Tawheed and shirk, between 
      guidance and misguidance. It is the difference between darkness and light. 
      We ask Allaah to illuminate our hearts with Tawheed and faith in Him 
      alone. 

    It should be noted that if a person is confused about the 
    meaning of any ambiguous passage [al-mutashaabuh] in the Book of Allaah, he 
    must understand it in the light of the definitive passages [[al-muhkamaat], 
    which form the majority of this clear Book. That is the source to which 
    reference should be made in order to understand it, know its rulings and 
    learn its lessons. He should not counter one verse with another, or look for 
    contradictions in the revelation, or look for the ambiguous passages which 
    may cause confusion to him or to other people, ignoring the clear and 
    definitive passages. That is the way of the people of innovation and is 
    misguidance, may Allaah keep us and you safe and sound. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“It is He Who has sent 
    down to you (Muhammad) the Book (this Qur’aan). In it are Verses that are 
    entirely clear, they are the foundations of the Book [and those are the 
    Verses of Al-Ahkaam (commandments), Al-Faraa’id (obligatory duties) and 
    Al-Hudood (laws for the punishment of thieves, adulterers)]; and others not 
    entirely clear. So as for those in whose hearts there is a deviation (from 
    the truth) they follow that which is not entirely clear thereof, seeking 
    Al-Fitnah (polytheism and trials), and seeking for its hidden meanings, but 
    none knows its hidden meanings save Allaah. And those who are firmly 
    grounded in knowledge say: “We believe in it; the whole of it (clear and 
    unclear Verses) are from our Lord.” And none receive admonition except men 
    of understanding”

    [Aal ‘Imraan 3:7]

    The verse which you quoted does not support the Christian 
    view in any way whatsoever, rather this verse, when taken in context, 
    refutes the Christians and clearly demonstrates their misguidance and their 
    disbelief in the Lord of the Worlds.  

    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“This is a part of the 
    news of the Ghayb (Unseen, i.e. the news of the past nations of which you 
    have no knowledge) which We reveal to you (O Muhammad). You were not with 
    them, when they cast lots with their pens as to which of them should be 
    charged with the care of Maryam (Mary); nor were you with them when they 
    disputed. 
45. (Remember) when the 
    angels said: ‘O Maryam (Mary)! Verily, Allaah gives you the glad tidings of 
    a Word [“Be!” — and he was! i.e. ‘Eesa (Jesus) the son of Maryam (Mary)] 
    from Him, his name will be the Messiah ‘Eesa (Jesus), the son of Maryam 
    (Mary), held in honour in this world and in the Hereafter, and will be one 
    of those who are near to Allaah.
46. He will speak to the 
    people, in the cradle and in manhood, and he will be one of the righteous.’
47. She said: ‘O my Lord! 
    How shall I have a son when no man has touched me?’ He said: ‘So (it will 
    be) for Allaah creates what He wills. When He has decreed something, He says 
    to it only: “Be!” — and it is. 
48. And He (Allaah) will 
    teach him [‘Eesa (Jesus)] the Book and Al-Hikmah (i.e. the Sunnah, the 
    faultless speech of the Prophets, wisdom), (and) the Tawraat (Torah) and the 
    Injeel (Gospel).
49. And will make him 
    [‘Eesa (Jesus)] a Messenger to the Children of Israel (saying): “I have come 
    to you with a sign from your Lord, that I design for you out of clay, a 
    figure like that of a bird, and breathe into it, and it becomes a bird by 
    Allaah’s Leave; and I heal him who was born blind, and the leper, and I 
    bring the dead to life by Allaah’s Leave. And I inform you of what you eat, 
    and what you store in your houses. Surely, therein is a sign for you, if you 
    believe.
50. And I have come 
    confirming that which was before me of the Tawraat (Torah), and to make 
    lawful to you part of what was forbidden to you, and I have come to you with 
    a proof from your Lord. So fear Allaah and obey me. 
51. Truly, Allaah is my 
    Lord and your Lord, so worship Him (Alone). This is the Straight Path”
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:44-51] 

    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiah (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    said: 

    This demonstrates in several ways that he was a created being 
    and was not as the Christians say.  

    For example, it clearly means that he was a created being, as 
    it says, “So (it will be) for Allaah creates what 
    He wills. When He has decreed something, He says to it only: “Be!” —and 
    it is”. As Allaah says elsewhere (interpretation 
    of the meaning): 

    “Verily, the likeness of ‘Eesa (Jesus) before Allaah is 
    the likeness of Adam. He created him from dust, then (He) said to him: “Be!” 
    — and he was”[Aal ‘Imraan 3:59]

    And Allaah says in Soorat Maryam (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “Such is ‘Eesa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary). (It is) a 
    statement of truth, about which they doubt (or dispute).

    It befits not (the Majesty of) Allaah that He should beget 
    a son [this refers to the slander of Christians against Allaah, by saying 
    that ‘Eesa (Jesus) is the son of Allaah]. Glorified (and Exalted) be He 
    (above all that they associate with Him). When He decrees a thing, He only 
    says to it: “Be!” and it is”

    [Maryam 19:35] 
And he said: His name is 
    the Messiah ‘Eesa ibn Maryam (Jesus son of Mary), so Allaah has told us that 
    he is the son of Maryam, and that he is held in honour in this world and in 
    the Hereafter, and will be one of those who are near to Allaah. All of these 
    are attributes of created beings. 
Maryam said: “How 
    shall I have a son…?” This shows that the Messiah, who is the Word, is 
    the son of Maryam, not the son of Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted. 
Allaah says in Soorat 
    al-Nisa’ (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O people of the 
    Scripture (Christians)! Do not exceed the limits in your religion, nor say 
    of Allaah aught but the truth. The Messiah ‘Eesa (Jesus), son of Maryam 
    (Mary), was (no more than) a Messenger of Allaah and His Word, (“Be!” — and 
    he was) which He bestowed on Maryam (Mary) and a spirit (Rooh) created by 
    Him; so believe in Allaah and His Messengers. Say not: ‘Three (trinity)!’ 
    Cease! (it is) better for you. For Allaah is (the only) One Ilaah (God), 
    glory is to Him (Far Exalted is He) above having a son. To Him belongs all 
    that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. And Allaah is 
    All‑Sufficient as a Disposer of affairs.
172. The Messiah will 
    never be proud to reject to be a slave of Allaah, nor the angels who are the 
    near (to Allaah). And whosoever rejects His worship and is proud, then He 
    will gather them all together unto Himself.
173. So, as for those 
    who believed (in the Oneness of Allaah — Islamic Monotheism) and did deeds 
    of righteousness, He will give them their (due) rewards — and more out of 
    His Bounty. But as for those who refused His worship and were proud, He will 
    punish them with a painful torment. And they will not find for themselves 
    besides Allaah any protector or helper”
[al-Nisa’ 4:171-173]
So Allaah forbids the 
    Christians to exaggerate concerning their religion or to say things about 
    Allaah that are not true, and He states that the Messiah ‘Eesa ibn Maryam is 
    a Messenger of Allaah and His Word which He bestowed upon Maryam, and a 
    spirit created by Him. He commands them to believe in Allaah and His 
    Messengers, and tells them that he (‘Eesa) is His Messenger. He forbids them 
    to say “Three” (i.e., trinity) and says: “Cease! (it is) better for you”. 
    This is a rejection of their doctrine concerning the Messiah which says that 
    “he is a true god from a true god, from the essence of his father.” 
Then He says: “glory 
    is to Him (Far Exalted is He) above having a son” – declaring Himself to 
    be far above having a son as the Christians say. Then He says: “To Him 
    belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth”, 
    telling us that all of that is His dominion, in which there is nothing of 
    His essence.  
Then He says: “The 
    Messiah will never be proud to reject to be a slave of Allaah, nor the 
    angels who are the near (to Allaah)” i.e., they will never deny that 
    they are slaves of Allaah, may He be blessed and exalted. After such a clear 
    statement, can anyone think that what is meant by “His Word” is that he is a 
    god and creator, or whatever such statements of kufr they make? 
Rather ‘Eesa alone is 
    described as the Word because he was not created in the usual way in which 
    others are created, rather he was created in an extraordinary way: he was 
    created by the command of Allaah: “Be!” This is the Word in question; he was 
    not created by means of a male fertilizing a female, as is the usual way in 
    which Allaah creates human beings. 
The fact that ‘Eesa 
    (peace be upon him) is a Word from Allaah and a spirit created by Him, as is 
    indicated in the texts of the clear Revelation, does not mean that he is 
    part of Allaah who emerged from Him and is connected to His essence: 
    glorified and exalted be Allaah far about what the wrongdoers say. Rather 
    what it means is that he came from Allaah, as Allaah says (interpretation of 
    the meaning): 
“And has subjected to 
    you all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth; it is all as a 
    favour and kindness from Him”
[al-Jaathiyah 45:13] 
“And whatever of 
    blessings and good things you have, it is from Allaah”
    [al-Nahl 16:53] 
“Whatever of good 
    reaches you, is from Allaah, but whatever of evil befalls you, is from 
    yourself”
[al-Nisa’ 4:79]
And Allaah says 
    concerning our Prophet Muhammad  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Those who disbelieve 
    from among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) and 
    Al‑Mushrikoon, were not going to leave (their disbelief) until there came to 
    them clear evidence.
2. A Messenger 
    (Muhammad) from Allaah, reciting (the Qur’aan) purified pages [purified from 
    Al‑Baatil (falsehood)]”
[al-Bayyinah 98:1-2]
These are all things 
    that come from Allaah, and they are all created. 
The phrase “a spirit 
    created by Him (or from Him)” is used only of the Messiah because he was 
    breathed into his mother by al-Rooh (Jibreel – peace be upon), and she 
    became pregnant with him from that breath. This is something other than his 
    rooh (soul) that he shares in common with the rest of mankind. He is 
    distinguished from them by the fact that his mother became pregnant with him 
    from this breathing in of the spirit, hence he is called a spirit from Him. 
    See Daqaa’iq al-Tafseer, 1/324 ff. 
Moreover these verses 
    clearly state that Allaah created him, and that Allaah creates whatever He 
    will; nothing is beyond Him in the heavens or on earth. And ‘Eesa himself 
    (peace be upon him) said that the signs and miracles that he brought were 
    from Allaah and happened by His leave, a sign to them of His Oneness. Then 
    the verses conclude with a clear statement of what is meant here, which is 
    the command to worship Allaah, the Lord of ‘Eesa and the Lord of those to 
    whom ‘Eesa was sent. This clearly indicates that what the Christians say 
    about ‘Eesa and his mother is false, and it plainly refutes their kufr and 
    misguidance. 
This verse also tells us 
    that ‘Eesa is a Word from Allaah, and it points to the meaning of that. This 
    is narrated in the Sunnah of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him). Al-Bukhaari (3435) and Muslim (28) narrated from ‘Ubaadah (may 
    Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever bears witness that there is no god except 
    Allaah alone, with no partner or associate, and that Muhammad is His slave 
    and Messenger, and that ‘Eesa is the slave of Allaah and His Messenger, His 
    Word that He bestowed upon Maryam and a spirit from Him, that Paradise is 
    true and Hell is true, Allaah will admit him to Paradise depending on his 
    deeds.” According to another version: “… that ‘Eesa is the slave of Allaah 
    and the son of His female slave.” 
Al-Qurtubi (may Allaah 
    have mercy on him) said: What this hadeeth aims at is to warn against what 
    the Christians fell into of misguidance concerning ‘Eesa and his mother. 
Another scholar said: 
    Mentioning ‘Eesa is a reference to the misguidance to the Christians, 
    because their belief in trinity is pure shirk. The same applies to the use 
    of the word “His slave”. Describing ‘Eesa as “His Messenger” is a reference 
    to the misguidance of the Jews because they deny that He was a Messenger and 
    they slandered him and likewise his mother, saying things of which they were 
    innocent. 
The words “son of His 
    female slave” are intended to honour him.",Islam Q&A
10686,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10686,There is no sin on a person who drops the Mus-haf unintentionally,"I am 18 years of age now, when I was only 10 I was reciting the Holy Quran once and then got up to offer Salah, so I quickly went and kept the Quran inside the cupboard on top of a box. After I finished offering my prayers I realized alas that the Holy Quran had dropped to the floor! I asked my Lord for forgiveness and I still ask His forgiveness after every Salah that I offer. Still, I am not at peace and want to offer my repentance once and for all! What should I do?",,,"Praise be to Allah.No Muslim doubts that it is obligatory to respect the 
          Book of Allaah, and the scholars are agreed that the one who deliberately 
          mishandles it is a kaafir.  
At the same time, Allaah says that there is no sin on 
          one who is ignorant, forgetful or makes a mistake.  
Allaah describes the believers as saying (interpretation 
          of the meaning): 
“ ‘Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into 
          error’”[al-Baqarah 2:286] 
According 
          to a report narrated by Muslim from the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (125), 
          Allaah said. “Yes”; according to another report from the hadeeth of 
          Ibn ‘Abbaas (126), Allaah said, “I have done that” (i.e., responded 
          to the prayer uttered in this aayah).
Whoever has no free will in a matter, such as one who 
          is forced to do something, or one who is asleep, is not sinning if he 
          says or does something that goes against Islam.  
You have not done anything that goes against Islam. When 
          the Mus-haf fell it was not by any deliberate action on your part, so 
          you have not fallen short in respecting it. Although Islam tells us 
          that we must repent from our sins and give them up, at the same time 
          it warns us against falling prey to waswaas (insinuating whispers of 
          the Shaytaan) and despairing of the forgiveness and mercy of Allaah.  
          
We ask Allaah to help you to do that which He loves and 
          is pleased with. And Allaah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
10690,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10690,How should a Muslim deal with books of knowledge?,How should a Muslim deal with books of knowledge?,,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          1.How should he deal 
          with the book?
 
          Dealing with the book involves several 
          things: 
 
          1 – Knowing the subject of the book – 
          so that he can benefit from it, because he needs to specialize. It may 
          be a book of sihr (witchcraft) or trickery or falsehood. So he has to 
          know the subject of the book so that he can benefit from it. 
 
          2 – He has to know its terminology. Because 
          knowing the terminology means that you will save a lot of time. This 
          is what the scholars do in the introduction to their books, for example 
          we know that when the author of Buloogh al Maraam says “agreed 
          upon”, he means that the hadeeth was narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim, 
          whereas the author of al-Muntaqaa uses this phrase in a different 
          manner – when he says “agreed upon”, he means that the hadeeth was narrated 
          by Imaam Ahmad, al-Bukhaari and Muslim. Similarly in books of fiqh, 
          the scholars use the words qawlayn, wajhayn, riwaayatayn 
          and ihtimaalayn differently. Riwaayatayn (two reports) 
          means two reports from the imaam; wajhayn (two views) means two 
          views among the companions, i.e., the companions of the leaders of the 
          madhhab; ihtimaalayn (two possibilities) is used in cases of 
          uncertainty as to which of the two views is correct; and qawlayn 
          (two opinions) is more general in meaning than that. 
 
          Similarly, we also need to know what 
          an author means if he says ijmaa’ (consensus) or wifaaq 
          (agreement). If he says ijmaa’, he means consensus among the 
          ummah, and if he says wifaaq he means agreement with the three 
          imams, as is the usage of the author of al-Furoo’ concerning 
          Hanbali fiqh. Similarly the followers of each madhhab all have their 
          own terminology, so it is essential to know the terminology of the author. 
 
          3 – Knowing the style and phrases used 
          in the book.  Hence you will find that when you read a book for 
          the first time, especially the academic books which are filled with 
          knowledge, you will come across a phrase whose meaning you will have 
          to ponder over, because you are not familiar with it. But if you read 
          the book again you will become familiar with it. 
 
          There is also something which needs to 
          be added to the book, which is writing comments in the margins and at 
          the foot of the pages. This is something which the seeker of knowledge 
          needs to make the most of. If he comes across something which needs 
          further explanation or evidence, and he is afraid that he may forget 
          it, then he should make a note either in the margin or at the foot of 
          the page. Often a person misses out on such benefits because he does 
          not make notes which take no more than a minute or two to do. Then when 
          he comes back he may or may not remember it. 
 
          The seeker of knowledge has to pay attention 
          to that, especially in books of fiqh. In some books you may come across 
          a matter and its rulings which causes you to be confused and have doubts. 
          If you refer to books which are more comprehensive than the book you 
          are reading, and you find something which explains the matter, then 
          you should make a note of it so that you can refer to it again if you 
          need to, without having to refer to the original book from which you 
          have quoted it. This will save you time. 
 
          2 – Reading books is of two types
 
          1 – Reading in depth to ponder and understand. 
          This necessarily takes time. 
 
          2 – A quick reading to get an idea of 
          the subject of the book, the topics covered and the content of the book. 
          This is done by thumbing through the book and skimming it. This does 
          not involve the same level of thinking as the first method. The best 
          way to read books is to ponder the meanings and seek help from scholars 
          who have understanding. It comes as no surprise that the book which 
          is most deserving of such a reading is the Book of Allaah. You must 
          be patient and persist in reading, for man has not been given any greater 
          gift than patience. 
 
          3 – Collecting books
 
          The seeker of knowledge should be keen 
          to collect books, but he should prioritize. If a person does not have 
          much money, then it is not good and is not wise to buy a lot of books 
          and have to pay for them, because this is bad management. If you cannot 
          buy books with your own money, then you can borrow them from any library. 
 
          4 – Being keen to read important books
 
          The seeker of knowledge must be keen 
          to read the most important reference books, not modern works, because 
          some of the modern writers do not have deep knowledge, so if you read 
          what they have written you will find that it is superficial. They may 
          quote things verbatim, or they may distort them to make them longer, 
          but it is all waffle. So you have to read the most important reference 
          works written by the salaf, because they are better and more blessed 
          than many of the books of the later generation. Most of the books of 
          the later writers are short on meanings but long-winded. You may read 
          a whole page which could have been summarized in one or two lines. But 
          you will find the books of the salaf to be easy, straightforward and 
          well written, with not even one word that has no meaning. 
 
          Among the best books that the seeker 
          of knowledge must be keen to read are 
          the books of Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and his student Ibn al-Qayyim 
          (may Allaah have mercy on them both). It is known that the books of 
          Ibn al-Qayyim are easier, because the style of Ibn Taymiyah is strongly-worded 
          because of his abundant knowledge and alert mind, and Ibn al-Qayyim 
          saw the knowledge of Ibn Taymiyah as a well-built house, and his own 
          role as that of organizing and adorning. But Ibn al-Qayyim was free 
          minded; if he thought that his shaykh’s view differed from what he thought 
          was correct, he would speak up. When he thought that the pilgrim should 
          go out of ihraam for Hajj then re-enter ihraam for ‘Umrah, because Ibn 
          ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) thought that if the person 
          who has not brought an animal for sacrifice enters ihraam for Hajj or 
          Qiraan, he must go out of ihraam for Hajj then enter ihraam for ‘Umrah, 
          whereas Ibn Taymiyah thought that this applied only to the Sahaabah, 
          he [Ibn al-Qayyim] said, “I am more inclined towards the opinion of 
          Ibn ‘Abbaas than to the opinion of my shaykh.” He clearly stated that 
          he was of a different view, so he was independent in his thinking. But 
          it comes as no surprise that he followed his shaykh (may Allaah have 
          mercy on him) in matters which he thought were true and correct. Undoubtedly 
          if you think about most of the opinions of Ibn Taymiyah you will find 
          that they are correct. This is something which anyone who ponders his 
          books will know. 
 
          5 – Evaluating books
 
          Books may be divided into three types:
 
           1 – Good books
 
          2 – Bad books
 
          3 – Books which are neither good nor 
          bad.
 
           Try to make sure that your bookshelf 
          is free of books which have bad content. There are books which are described 
          as literature, but they simply kill time without producing any benefit. 
          And there are harmful books which contain specific ideas or promote 
          incorrect ideology. These also should not be allowed on your bookshelf, 
          whether that is because the methodology the use is wrong, or because 
          of their wrong understanding of ‘aqeedah, and revolutionary books which 
          promote a harmful ideology.  
 
          In general, no harmful book should be 
          allowed on your bookshelf, because books nourish the soul just as food 
          and drink nourish the body. If you nourish it with books such as those 
          it will cause you a great deal of harm and you will follow a methodology 
          which goes against the methodology of the seeker of sound knowledge.","From Fataawa al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, Kitaab al-‘Ilm, p. 87-91"
10693,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10693,Learning from Ash’ari shaykhs,"We are students who are seeking knowledge. We study ‘aqeedah with some teachers who are teaching us Ash’ari ‘aqeedah. They interpret the hand of Allaah as meaning His power or His blessing, and His being above His throne (istiwaa’) as meaning His sovereignty, and so on. What is the ruling on studying with these teachers?",,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          These people who interpret the Qur’aan in this manner, 
          whether they are called Ash’aris or some other name, have gone astray 
          from the path of the righteous salaf. Not even one letter of what these 
          people say in their misinterpretations has been narrated from the righteous 
          salaf. Let them bring one word from the Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), or from Abu Bakr, or ‘Umar, 
          or ‘Uthmaan, or ‘Ali, to say that they interpreted Allaah’s hand as 
          meaning His power, or that they interpreted His being above the Throne 
          (istiwaa’) as referring to His Sovereignty, or that they interpreted 
          His Face as meaning reward, or that they interpreted His love as meaning 
          reward, etc. Let them produce one word from them to show that they interpreted 
          these aayahs and similar verses in the manner that these people interpret 
          them. If they cannot produce any such thing, let it be said that either 
          the righteous salaf, headed by the Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), the leader of the pious, 
          were unaware of the meaning of this tremendous ‘aqeedah (of Islam), 
          or they did know it but they concealed the truth. But neither of these 
          can be said of the Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or of any of the Rightly-Guided 
          Khaleefahs, or of his Companions (may Allaah be pleased with them). 
          If that is the case then we have to follow their path (the path of the 
          Prophet and the Rightly-Guided Khaleefahs).
 
          My advice to these people is to fear 
          Allaah and to abandon what So and so said, and to come back to the Book 
          of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and the way of the Rightly-Guided 
          Khaleefahs who came after him. They should know that there will come 
          a Day when they will return to Allaah, when they will not be able to 
          use the opinion of So and so as evidence. By Allaah, So and so will 
          not be able to help them on that Day.  Allaah says (interpretation 
          of the meaning): 
 
          “And (remember) the Day (Allaah) will 
          call to them, and say: ‘What answer gave you to the Messengers?’”
 
          [al-Qasas 28:65]
 
          He did not say, Remember the Day when 
          (Allaah) will call to them and say, ‘What answer gave you to So and 
          so…?’ 
 
          And Allaah says in His Book (interpretation 
          of the meaning): 
 
          “So believe in Allaah and His Messenger 
          (Muhammad), the Prophet who can neither read nor write (i.e. Muhammad), 
          who believes in Allaah and His Words, and follow him so that you may 
          be guided”
 
          [al-A’raaf 7:158]
 
          Allaah commanded us to believe in him and follow him. 
          If this is the case then how can a person believe in Allaah and His 
          Messenger in the true and complete sense, then turn away from the Sunnah 
          of His Messenger 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the way in which he 
          believed in his Lord, and misinterpret the way in which Allaah has described 
          Himself in His Book or the way in which His Messenger 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) has described Him, simply 
          because of illusions which they call rational thought? 
 
          I advise them to come back to Allaah and to abandon any 
          other opinion, and follow what Allaah and His Messenger say, for if 
          they die following that they will have died following the truth. But 
          if they go against that then they are in grave danger and those whose 
          opinions they are following will not protect them from Allaah. Allaah 
          says (interpretation of the meaning): 
 “(Remember) 
          the Day when every person will come up pleading for himself, and every 
          one will be paid in full for what he did (good or evil, belief or disbelief 
          in the life of this world) and they will not be dealt with unjustly”
 
          [al-Nahl 16:111]
 
           I repeat this advice to every believer, to come 
          back to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with regard to what he believes 
          about his Lord and God, following the path of the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), the rightly guided khaleefahs 
          who came after him, and the imams of the Muslims who led the people 
          in following the Sunnah of the Messenger 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), without referring to rational 
          thought, which is no more than an illusion, concerning issue that have 
          to do with Allaah and His names and attributes. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn 
          Taymiyah spoke well when he described the ahl al-kalaam (“Islamic” philosophers) 
          as “having been given intelligence but not knowledge, and had having 
          been given smartness but not sincerity.” So one has to deepen one’s 
          knowledge on the basis of the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). I ask Allaah to help us 
          all to have faith and to cause us to meet Him when He is pleased with 
          us, for He is Able to do all things. Praise be to Allaah, the Lord of 
          the Worlds, and may Allaah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet 
          Muhammad and his family and companions. 
 
          I call upon all seekers of knowledge to call their brothers 
          to that which they have heard, for by Allaah it is the truth. Whoever 
          claims to have truth other than this, we will accept it and adhere to 
          it (if it can be proven to be true).","From Fataawa al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, Kitaab al-‘Ilm, p. 226"
