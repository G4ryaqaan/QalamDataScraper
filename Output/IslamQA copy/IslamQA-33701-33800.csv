33702,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/33702,He fell in love with a girl then he repented. Can he be friends with her?,"A young Muslim man went to study aboard, far from his family. He got to know a Muslim girl and the relationship between them grew until it became love, and they touched one another and kissed, but they did not commit fornication (zina). He feels fear of Allaah and he asked her to change the relationship with him or to give it up because what they did is a sin. She understood that and said, “Let’s remain friends and we will never speak of love again, we can just be friends.” He feels that he has made a sacrifice for the sake of Allaah, because he loves her very much, but he feels that this is not enough to please Allaah. Is it permissible for him to speak to her as just a friend? How can he explain to her that he does not want to be selfish, because he loves her very much but his love for Allaah is greater?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
Following the paths of fitnah is one of the 
    reasons why Muslims fall into the traps of the Shaytaan. The rulings of Islam bar the way to many of these paths and warn against following them. 
    Islam also warns against following in the footsteps of the Shaytaan. 
One of these reasons or causes is Muslims 
    travelling to kaafir countries and settling there either alone or with their families; studying in mixed universities and keeping company with 
    immoral people who do not point him in the direction of good or warn him against evil; giving his faculties free rein to commit sin, such as 
    letting his ears listen to singing or his eyes look at haraam things, and so on. 
A man cannot protect himself unless he keeps 
    away from these paths that lead to evil, and looks for the ways of peace and guidance with which his Lord is pleased.  
Secondly: 
We think that our brother is on the right 
    track and is guided in sha Allaah, because he fears his Lord and has given up his relationship with this girl, after committing sin with her 
    because of his following the paths of evil mentioned above. 
The attitude of fearing Allaah is very 
    important, and giving up one’s desires for the sake of Allaah is something which no one can achieve except those who understand Tawheed truly, in 
    whose hearts faith is alive and manifests itself in their physical actions. 
But he has to remain steadfast in his 
    actions, and not let the Shaytaan lead him down another path that will lead to the same result of committing haraam actions. There can be no 
    friendship between him and this girl who is a stranger (non-mahram) to him. What this friendship leads to is well known, so he must not respond to 
    her request. He should adhere to his stance and seek the help of Allaah, asking Him to guide him to the straight path and make him steadfast in 
    following true guidance. 
Thirdly: 
If he really loves her, then the sound way 
    that is prescribed in sharee’ah is for him to marry her; there is no other option. But if he thinks of marriage he should choose one who has a 
    good character and is religiously committed, as the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) advised. If he does not marry her, 
    then being friends with her will lead to him doing haraam things, as he himself says happened. Indeed, if the heart remains attached in this way, 
    even if no physical immoral actions take place, it will still affect his heart and his relationship with Allaah and his submission to Him, in a 
    way that is worse than committing physical immoral actions. 
Shaykh Muhammad al-Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen said:
 If it so happens that there is love between 
    a man and a woman, the most effective means of warding off fitnah (temptation) and immorality is for them to get married, because his heart will 
    still remain attached to her if he does not marry her, and that may lead to fitnah. 
A man may hear that a woman has a good 
    character, and that she is knowledgeable, so he may want to marry her; or she may hear that this man is of good character, knowledgeable and 
    religiously committed, so she wants to marry him, but the communication between the two is not done in the proper Islamic manner – this is very 
    serious. In this case it is not permissible for the man to contact the woman or vice versa, and say that he wants to marry her. Rather he should 
    tell her guardian that he wants to marry her, or she should tell her guardian that she wants to marry him, as ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with 
    him) did when he offered his daughter Hafsah in marriage to Abu Bakr and ‘Uthmaan (may Allaah be pleased with them both). 
But if the woman gets in touch with the man 
    directly, this is what leads to fitnah.

This is the view of the majority of the earlier and later scholars, and is the view of the four imams. When mentioning the women who are mahrams for men , Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):

Can you marry your step sister?
But with regard to you, this stepdaughter is not a mahram for the son of her mother’s husband, so it is permissible for you to marry her , and there is no problem in that.  
The Standing Committee was asked about marrying the daughter of the father’s wife. They replied: 
“It is permissible for the son of the man mentioned to marry the daughter of the woman mentioned, even if his father is married to her mother. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):

Ive heard that nail biting is deeply disliked in Islam, but nobody has been able to give me any substantive reasoning to prove this.
Can you please guide me here?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The doctors say that the phenomenon of nail biting among children is connected to psychological problems. If you have had this problem since you were small, then we advise you to consult a psychologist whom you trust with regard to his religious commitment and knowledge. 
From the point of view of sharee’ah: 
Islam brought the best of attitudes and habits, and forbids bad attitudes and habits. This habit – nail biting – is disliked by most people and they regard it as a bad habit. This is in addition to the physical harm that it may do, because of the dirt that collects under the fingernails and the damage that this may do to the nails and teeth. 
Hence you should make yourself stop this habit. That may be difficult in the beginning, but you will get used to it and it will become a habit after that. This is the case with all good attitudes that a person can make himself do until they becomes a habit and second nature for him.

Not entering ihram from the miqat

Uncovering the right shoulder and throwing the end of the rida over the left shoulder from the time of entering ihram


Believing that it is obligatory to pray two rak’ahs when entering ihram","Praise be to Allah.Mistakes made in ihram
Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Some of the mistakes made by some pilgrims with regard to ihram include the following:
Not entering ihram from the miqat 
Some pilgrims, especially those who come by air, do not enter ihram from the miqat and wait until they arrive in Jeddah, even though they pass over the miqat. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) defined the miqats and said: “They are for them (their residents) and whoever comes to them who is not of their people.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1524; Muslim, 1181)
Al-Bukhari narrated that when the people of Iraq complained to ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him), saying that the miqat that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had defined for the people of Najd was out of their way, or was too far for them, he (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Look for a place that is in line with it on your route.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1531)
This indicates that coming in line with the miqat is like passing through it. So one who comes in line with the miqat from above, in a plane, is like one who passes through it, so he has to enter ihram when he comes in line with the miqat, and it is not permissible for him to pass the miqat and enter ihram when he lands in Jeddah.
The way to correct this mistake is to do ghusl in one’s house or in the airport, and to change in the plane and put on the ihram garments and take off one’s regular clothes. Then when he comes in line with the miqat he should enter ihram from there, and recite the talbiyah for whatever he intends to do, ‘Umrah or Hajj. 
It is not permissible for him to delay that until he reaches Jeddah. If he does that then he has done wrong and according to the majority of scholars he has to offer a sacrifice which he should slaughter in Makkah and distribute the meat to the poor, because he has omitted one of the obligatory duties. 
Some think that entering ihram wearing shoes is essential 
Some people think that it is essential to enter ihram wearing shoes , and that if a person is not wearing shoes when he enters ihraam, then it is not permissible for him to put them on. 
This is a mistake because it is not essential to wear shoes when entering ihram. Ihram may be done without wearing shoes, and if a person enters ihram without wearing shoes, that does not mean that he cannot put them on afterwards. He can put shoes on afterwards if he wasn’t wearing them when he entered ihram – there is nothing wrong with that.
Thinking that it is essential to enter ihram in the ihram garments and to keep them on until they exit ihram
Some people think that it is essential to enter ihram in the ihram garments and to keep them on until they exit ihram, and that it is not permitted to change these clothes . This is a mistake, because the muhrim (person in ihram) is permitted to change his ihram garments with or without a reason, if he changes them for something that he is permitted to wear during ihram.
In this regard, there is no difference between men and women. Anyone who enters ihram in ihram garments and wants to change it may do so, but sometimes he may have to change it, such as if it becomes contaminated with some impurity (najasah) that he cannot wash without taking it off. And sometimes changing it may be preferable, such as if it becomes very dirty, without there being any najasah, so he should change it for a clean ihram garment.
Sometimes the matter may be one in which he has the choice: if he wants he can change it and if he does not want he does not have to change it. The point is that this notion is incorrect, namely the pilgrim’s belief that if he enters ihram in a certain garment it is not permissible for him to take it off until he has exited his ihram.
Uncovering the right shoulder and throwing the end of the rida over the left shoulder from the time of entering ihram
Some people uncover their right shoulder and throw the end of the rida (upper garment) over their left shoulder from the time they enter ihram, i.e., from the moment they form the intention, so we see many pilgrims – if not most of them – wearing their ihram garments in this manner from the moment they enter ihram until they exit ihram. This is a mistake, because this manner of wearing the ihram is only to be done during Tawaf al-Qudum (the tawaf performed upon arrival in Makkah), not during al-sa’i and not before the tawaf.
Believing that it is obligatory to pray two rak’ahs when entering ihram 
Some of them believe that it is obligatory to pray two rak’ahs when entering ihram . This is also a mistake; it is not obligatory to pray two rak’ahs when entering ihram. Rather the correct view on this matter was that suggested by Abu’l-‘Abbas Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him), who said that there is no specific prayer to be offered when entering ihram, because that was not narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).
 If a person does ghusl and puts on the ihram garments, then he should enter ihram without praying, unless it is the time of prayer, such as if the time for an obligatory prayer has come or is approaching, and he wants to stay at the miqat until he has prayed. In that case it is better for him to enter ihram after praying. With regard to intending to pray a specific prayer in ihram, the most correct opinion is that there is no specific prayer for entering ihram.",From Daleel al-Akhta’ allati yaqa’u fiha al-Haaj wa’l-Mu’tamir

    If something happens to the worshipper whilst he is praying 
    that means that he has to stop the prayer – such as if he starts a naafil 
    prayer then the iqaamah for prayer is given – then the intention to stop the 
    prayer is sufficient, and he should not say the tasleem, because the proper 
    place for the tasleem is at the end of the prayer. ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may 
    Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet  (peace and blessings of

    by saying tasleem (‘Al-salaamu aleikum’ – peace be upon you’).” Narrated by 
    the authors of Sunan apart from al-Nasaa’i, with a saheeh isnaad. 

    With regard to the one whose prayer becomes invalidated, he should stop his prayer without saying tasleem and with no intention, because his prayer has been invalidated.","From the fatwas of Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez Aal al-Shaykh. Majallat al-Buhooth al-Islamiyyah, 61/82"

“With regard to the family of the one who is going to offer the sacrifice, they are not subject to any obligations, and it is not forbidden for them to remove anything from their hair or nails, according to the sounder of the two scholarly views. Rather the ruling applies only to the one who is going to offer the sacrifice , the one who has bought the sacrificial animal from his own wealth.” (Fatawa Islamiyyah, 2/316) 
It says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah (11/397): 
“It is prescribed for the one who wants to offer a sacrifice, once the new moon of Dhul Hijjah appears, not to remove anything from his hair, nails or skin , until he has offered the sacrifice. 
Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When you see the new moon of Dhul Hijjah , if any one of you wants to offer a sacrifice, let him leave his hair and nails alone.”  (Narrated by the group except al-Bukhari)
A version narrated by Abu Dawud (2791) and Muslim (1977) says: “Whoever has an animal to slaughter , when the new moon of Dhul Hijjah appears, let him not remove anything from his hair or nails until he has offered the sacrifice.” This applies whether he is going to slaughter the sacrifice himself or he has appointed someone else to do it; but with regard to those on whose behalf the sacrifice is being offered [i.e., his family etc], that is not prescribed for them, because there is no report to that effect.” 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’ (7/530): 
“For the person on whose behalf the sacrifice is offered, there is no blame on him if he removes anything from his hair or nails. The evidence for that is as follows: 

This is the apparent meaning of the hadith, which indicates that the prohibition applies only to the one who is going to offer the sacrifice. Based on this, the prohibition applies only to the head of the household, not to the members of his family, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) connected the ruling to the one who is going to offer the sacrifice, so what is understood is that this ruling does not apply to those on whose behalf the sacrifice is offered. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to offer the sacrifice on behalf of his household and it is not narrated that he said to them, “Do not remove anything from your hair or nails or skin.” If that had been forbidden for them, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would have told them not to do it.

There are many verses which speak of enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil; that is because of the importance of this issue and the great need that exists for it. 
According to a saheeh hadeeth, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever among you sees an evil action, let him change it with his hand [by taking action]; if he cannot, then with his tongue [by speaking out]; and if he cannot, then with his heart [by at least hating it and believing that it is wrong], and that is the weakest of faith.” Narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh. 
Changing evil by one's hand should be done by those who are able to do that, such as those in positions of authority and the bodies in charge of such matters in the areas over which they have been appointed, the ruler in the area over which he has been appointed, the judge in the area over which he has been appointed, and by a man in his own house with his children and the members of his household, as much as he can. 
But if he is not able to do that, or if changing it with his hand will lead to fitnah (tribulation) and conflict, and cause more harm than good, then he should not change it with his hand, rather he should change it with his tongue, by speaking out. That will be sufficient lest changing it with his hand will lead to a worse evil that that which he is seeking to change. This was stated by the scholars. 
In the case of changing evil with his tongue, it is sufficient for him to say, “O my brother, fear Allaah, this is not permitted, you should stop this, you should do such and such” and other good words spoken in a proper manner. 
After the tongue comes the heart, i.e., hating the evil in one's heart, showing that one hates it, and not sitting with those who do it. All of these come under the heading of changing it with one's heart. And Allaah is the Source of strength.","From the fatwas of Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz, Majallat al-Buhooth al-Islamiyyah, 36/121-122"

Scholars have ruled that non-intoxicating beer is permissible because it is completely free of alcohol, or because it contains a minuscule amount of alcohol.","Types of beer


Scholarly views on non-intoxicating beer","Praise be to Allah.Types of beer
It is essential to differentiate between the two kinds of beer: 
The first is the intoxicating beer that is sold in some countries. This beer is khamr (an intoxicant) and it is haram to sell it , buy it and drink it. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Every intoxicant is khamr and every intoxicant is haram.” Narrated by Muslim, 2003. 
It is haram to drink a lot or a little of it, even a single drop, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whatever intoxicates in large quantities, a little of it is haram.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1865; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi. 
The second type is beer that is not intoxicating , either because it is completely free of alcohol, or because it contains a minuscule amount of alcohol that does not reach the level of causing intoxication no matter how much a person drinks of it. The scholars have ruled that this is permissible. 
Scholarly views on non-intoxicating beer
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said: 
“The beer that is on sale in our marketplaces [in Saudi Arabia] is all halal, because it has been inspected by the officials and is completely free of alcohol. The basic principle concerning all kinds of food, drink and clothing is that they are permissible until and unless proof is established that they are haram. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“He it is Who created for you all that is on earth” [al-Baqarah 2:29]
So if anyone says, this drink is haram, or this food is haram, or this garment is haram, say to him, bring your proof. If he brings proof then we should do whatever is indicated by the proof. If he does not bring proof, then his words are to be rejected, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“He it is Who created for you all that is on earth” [al-Baqarah 2:29]
Everything in this world Allah has created for us. This general meaning is confirmed by the word jami’an (translated here as “all”). And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“while He has explained to you in detail what is forbidden to you” [al-An’am 6:119] 
So if something is haram, there should be a clear and detailed indication that it is haram. If there is no such proof, then it is not haram. The beer that is to be found in our markets here in the Land of the Two Holy Sanctuaries (Saudi Arabia) is all halal and there is no doubt concerning that in sha Allah. 
We do not think that any alcoholic content in a thing makes it haram, rather if something contains a percentage of alcohol which will make a person intoxicated if he drinks it, then it is haram. But if the amount is miniscule and does not have any effect, then it is halal.  
Some people think that the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “Whatever intoxicates in large quantities, a little of it is haram”, mean that if a small percentage of an intoxicant is mixed with a large amount of a substance that is not intoxicating, then it is haram. This is a misunderstanding of the hadith. “Whatever intoxicates in large quantities, a little of it is haram” means that if a lot of something will cause intoxication, and a little of it will not cause intoxication, then a lot or a little are both haram, because you may drink a little that does not cause intoxication, then you may be tempted to drink more and become intoxicated. But if something is mixed with alcohol but the alcohol is a small amount and does not have any effect, then it is halal and does not come under the ruling of this hadith.” (Al-Bab al-Maftuh, 3/381-382)

33769,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/33769,Wrongfully judging a person to be an apostate because he went out with a girl who was unveiled,"What is the ruling on a person who says to someone, ""You are an apostate from Islam"" because he goes with a girl who is unveiled and wears makeup?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    It is not permissible for a Muslim to use the word kaafir 
    lightly, because judging a Muslim who believes in Tawheed to be a kaafir is 
    a major sin. Muslim (60) narrated from 'Abd-Allaah ibn 'Umar that the 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said: ""Any man who says to his 
    brother, 'O kaafir,' if this description fits him, then he is a kaafir, 
    otherwise it will come back on him (the one who said it)."" 

    Al-Bukhaari (6054) narrated from Abu Dharr (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) that he heard the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) say: ""No man accuses another of being immoral or of 
    being a kaafir but it will come back on him if his companion is not like 
    that."" 

    Secondly: 

    The one who wants to denounce an evil action or to exhort a 
    sinner should do that in a kind and gentle manner, because this is more 
    likely to make his words acceptable and effective. It was narrated from 
    'Aa'ishah, the wife of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) said: ""Allaah is Kind and loves kindness, and He gives (reward) 
    for kindness that He does not give for harshness and He does not give for 
    anything else. 

    Al-Nawawi said: 

    This hadeeth points to the virtue of kindness and encourages 
    us to adopt this attitude; and it condemns harshness. Kindness is the cause 
    of all goodness. Al-Qaadi said: What this means is that goals may be 
    achieved by means of kindness that cannot be achieved by anything else. 

    With regard to uttering words such as kaafir (disbeliever), 
    faasiq (immoral person), murtadd (apostate), etc, this may be a cause of the 
    person being put off and persisting in his sin, and not accepting the 
    truth. 

    Al-Haafiz said in his commentary on the hadeeth of Abu Dharr 
    mentioned above: 

    This shows that if a person says to another, ""You are a 
    faasiq (immoral person)"" or ""You are a kaafir"", and that is not the case, 
    then he is the one who deserves to be described in that manner. If the 
    person is as described, it does not necessarily mean that the one who called 
    him that is free of sin. If the intention is to advise him or someone else 
    by referring to his situation, it is permissible, but if the intention is to 
    expose and shame him, and and to hurt him, then it is not permissible, 
    because we are commanded to conceal people's faults and teach then and 
    advise then in a manner that is better. As far as a person is able to 
    achieve that in a kind manner, it is not permissible for him to do it in a 
    harsh manner, because that may make him stubborn and cause him to persist in 
    that action, as is the nature of many people.  

    Thirdly: 

    Going with a girl who is unveiled and wears makeup is not 
    kufr, rather it is a sin because it is one of the means that lead to immoral 
    actions. But he should advise this person who has gone with a girl who is 
    unveiled and wears makeup, so that Allaah may guide him thereby.","Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa'imah, 17/66"

Doing a movement before the imam 


Ruling on the prayer of one who anticipates the imam 


Delaying in following the imam 


Doing an action simultaneously with the imam 


Doing a movement immediately after the imam","Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’: 
Scenarios of praying behind an imam
“When a person prays behind an imam, four scenarios may apply: 

Anticipation (doing a movement before the imam) 
Delay in following the imam
Doing an action simultaneously with the imam 
Following (doing a movement immediately after the imam)

Doing a movement before the imam 
This refers to the person doing one of the essential parts of prayer before the imam, such as prostrating or rising before the imam, or bowing or rising from bowing before him. This is haram, and the evidence for that is the hadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Do not bow until he bows , do not prostrate until he prostrates.” The basic principle is that the words “do not” indicate that the action is haram, and if someone were to say that it is a major sin, that would not be far fetched, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Does the one who raises his head before the imam not fear that Allah may turn his head into the head of a donkey, or make his form like that of a donkey?” This is a warning, and a warning is one of the signs that a sin is a major sin. 
Ruling on the prayer of one who anticipates the imam 
If a person anticipates the imam knowingly, aware of the ruling and of what he is doing, then his prayer is invalid. But if he is ignorant or forgot, then his prayer is valid, unless that excuse ceased to exist before the imam did that action, in which case he has to go back and repeat what he did before the imam, after the imam. If he does not do that, knowing the ruling and being aware of what he is doing, then his prayer is invalid, otherwise it is not.  
Delaying in following the imam 
There are two kinds of delay in following the imam: 

Delay for a reason
Delay without any excuse


The first kind is where there is a reason or excuse. He has to make up what he delayed, then he should follow the imam, and there will be no blame on him, even if it is one or two essential parts of the prayer. 

So if a person is distracted or loses focus, or did not hear the imam until the imam has done one or two essential parts of the prayer before him, then he should do the things that he delayed in and then follow the imam, unless the imam reaches the point where he is [in the rak`ah], in which case he should not make up the missing parts and he should stay with the imam. Then one rak`ah will be valid for him which is formed from two rak`ahs of the imam, the rak`ah in which he delayed and the rak`ah which the imam reached the same point as him.
An example of that is that a man was praying with the imam and the imam bowed, rose, prostrated, sat up, prostrated a second time and stood up, but the person praying behind him did not hear the loudspeaker except in the second rak`ah, because the electricity cut out for example. 
Let us assume that this was during Jumu`ah prayer, so he heard the imam reciting al-Fatihah , then the electricity cut out, and the imam completed the first rak`ah, but the person remained standing thinking that the imam had not yet bowed in the first rak`ah, then he heard him reciting “Has there come to you the narration of the overwhelming (i.e. the Day of Resurrection)?” [Al-Ghashiyah 88:1 – interpretation of the meaning] 
We say: you should stay with the imam, so the second rak`ah for the imam will be the rest of the first rak`ah for you. Then when the imam says the taslim, you should make up the second rak`ah. The scholars said: so the person praying behind the imam will have one rak`ah that is formed from the two rak`ahs of his imam, because followed the imam in part of the first and part of the second.  
If he realizes that he has lagged behind before the imam reaches the same point [in the second rak`ah], he should make it up and follow the imam. For example, a man is standing with the imam, and the imam bows but he does not hear that he is bowing. When the imam says “Sami’a Allahu liman hamidah [Allah hears those who praise Him – said when rising from bowing], when the person praying behind him hears that, we say to him: Bow and rise, and follow your imam, and you will have caught up with the rak`ah, because the delay here was for a reason. 

The second type is delaying with no excuse. 

Delaying with regard to an essential part of the prayer means lagging behind in following the imam, but catching up with him in the next essential part of the prayer. For example, the imam bows when you still have a verse or two left of the surah you are reciting, so you remain standing to complete what you still have to recite, but then you bow and catch up with the imam in ruku`. In this case the rak`ah is valid, but your action goes against the Sunnah, because what is prescribed is to start bowing when the imam reaches the bowing posture and not to lag behind, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When he bows, then bow.” 
Lagging behind in an essential part of the prayer means that the imam is one step ahead of you in the prayer, i.e., he bows and rises before you bow. The jurists (may Allah have mercy on them) said: if you lag behind in ruku` then your prayer is invalid, just as if you did ruku` before the imam. If you lag behind in sujud (prostration) then according to what the jurists say your prayer is valid, because it is lagging behind in an essential part of the prayer other than ruku`. 
But the correct view is that if a person lags behind the imam in any essential part of the prayer with no excuse, then his prayer is invalid, whether that is in ruku` or any other part of the prayer. Based on this, if the imam rises from the first prostration and this person who is praying behind him is making du`a in sujud and continues to make du`a until the imam prostrates for the second time, then his prayer is invalid, because he has lagged behind in an essential part of the prayer. If the imam is one step ahead of him, how can he then be following him? 
Doing an action simultaneously with the imam 
This refers either to word or actions, and falls into two categories: 

The first category is to say words simultaneously. This does not matter, except in the case of the takbirat al-ihram (saying “Allahu akbar” to start the prayer) and the salam (at the end of the prayer). 

With regard to the first takbir, if you say takbir before the imam has completed his takbirat al-ihram, you have not entered prayer in the first place, because it is essential to say the takbirat al-ihram after the imam has finished saying it completely. 
With regard to the salam, the scholars said that it is makruh to say the first and second salam at the same time as your imam, but if you say the first salam after he has said the first salam and the second salam after he has said the second salam, there is nothing wrong with this, but it is better not to say the salam until the imam has said both. 
With regard to all other words of the prayer, it does not matter if you say them simultaneously with the imam, or before him, or after him. If we assume that you hear the imam reciting the tashahhud, and you have already recited it, this does not matter, because anticipating the imam in the words of prayer, apart from the first takbir and the salam, does not affect the prayer. Similarly it does not matter if you recite al-Fatihah before him and say Wa la’l-dallin “nor of those who went astray” [Al-Fatihah 1:7 – interpretation of the meaning], whilst he is still reciting Iyyaka na’abudu wa iyyaka nasta’in “You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything)” [Al-Fatihah 1:5 – interpretation of the meaning], in Zuhr prayer, for example, because it is prescribed in Zuhr and  ‘Asr prayer for the imam to let the people hear the verse he is reciting sometimes, as the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to do. 

The second category is to do the actions of prayer simultaneously with the imam, and this is makruh. 

For example, when the imam says “Allahu akbar” for ruku`, and starts to bend forward, and you start to bow simultaneously with the imam, this is makruh, because the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “When he bows, then bow, and do not bow until he bows.” And in sujud when he says takbir for sujud, if you prostrate and reach the floor at the same time as him, this is makruh, because the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) disallowed that and said, “Do not prostrate until he prostrates.” 
Doing a movement immediately after the imam 
Following is the Sunnah, and what it means is that a person starts to do the actions of prayer immediately after the imam starts them, but without doing them at the same time. 
For example, when he bows, you bow, even if you have not completed the recitation that is mustahabb [recommended, encouraged], and even if you have a verse still to go, because that would mean that you are lagging behind, so you do not complete it. 
In sujud, when the imam rises from his prostration, you follow the imam, and your following him is better than your remaining in prostration making du`a to Allah , because your prayer is connected to the imam, and you are now enjoined to follow your imam.” (Adapted from al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 4/275) 
The person who is praying behind an imam should not move to the next posture of the prayer until the imam has reached it, so he should not start to go down for prostration, until the imam has placed his forehead on the ground. 
Al-Bara ibn ‘Azib said: When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ‘Sami’a Allahu liman hamidah’, none of us would then bend our backs [to start prostrating] until the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went down into prostration, then we would go down into prostration after him. Narrated by al-Bukhari, 690; Muslim, 474.

33795,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/33795,Ruling on slaughtering the hadiy outside Makkah,"Some pilgrims pay money to some charitable institutions who slaughter the hadiy (animal to be sacrificed at the end of Hajj) and distribute it all over the world. What is the ruling on this action, may Allah reward you?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.This question was put to Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him), who replied: 
This is a mistake which goes against the sharee’ah of Allah and is cheating the slaves of Allah. The place where the hadiy should be slaughtered is in Makkah, because the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) slaughtered his hadiy in Makkah, not in Madeenah or in any other place. The scholars have stated that, and said: It is obligatory to slaughter the hadiy of tamattu’ and qiraan, and the hadiy offered to compensate for omitting an obligatory part of Hajj, in Makkah. Allah has stated that with reference to the penalty for hunting in ihraam, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“the penalty is an offering, brought to the Ka‘bah, of an eatable animal (i.e. sheep, goat, cow) equivalent to the one he killed”
[al-Maa’idah 5:95]
If a specific place is mentioned, it is not permissible to change it to somewhere else, rather it must be done in that place. So the hadiy must be slaughtered in Makkah, and distributed in Makkah. If it so happens that he cannot find anyone to accept it in Makkah, which is an assumption that may be impossible, then there is nothing wrong with slaughtering it in Makkah and sending the meat to anyone who needs it in the Muslim lands, the closest then the next closest, or where the need is greatest.",Reference: Daleel al-Akhta’ allati yaqa’a fiha al-Haaj wa’l-Mu’tamir (mistakes made by pilgrims performing Hajj and ‘Umrah)
33798,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/33798,Passing the meeqaat without entering ihraam,What is the ruling on passing the meeqaat without entering ihraam when one wants to perform Hajj?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Whoever passes the meeqaat, intending to do Hajj or ‘Umrah, has to enter ihraam from the meeqaat. If he passes it and does not enter ihraam, then he has to go back and enter ihraam from there. If he does not do that, and enters ihraam after passing the meeqaat, the best known view among the scholars is that he has to offer a sacrifice, so he should slaughter a sheep in Makkah and distribute its meat to the poor. 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
Whoever passes the meeqaat for Hajj or ‘Umrah and does not enter ihraam has to go back and enter ihraam for Hajj or ‘Umrah from the meeqaat, because the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded that, as he said: “The people of Madeenah should enter ihraam from Dhu’l-Hulayfah, the people of Syria from al-Jahfah, the people of Najd from Qarn and the people of Yemen from Yalamlam.” 
If his intention is to perform Hajj or ‘Umrah then he has to enter ihraam from the meeqaat that he passes. So if he is coming via Madeenah he should enter ihraam from Dhu’l-Hulayfah; if he is coming via Syria, Egypt or North Africa he should enter ihraam from al-Jahfah which is in Raabigh; if he is coming via Yemen he should enter ihraam from Yalamlam; if he is coming from Najd or al-Taa’if he should enter ihraam from the valley of Qarn which is known nowadays as al-Sayl, or some people call it Wadi Muharram. He should enter ihraam from that point for Hajj or ‘Umrah, or for both together…”

Shaykh Ibn Jibreen said: 
Whoever enters ihraam after passing the meeqaat has to offer a sacrifice. And Allaah knows best.
