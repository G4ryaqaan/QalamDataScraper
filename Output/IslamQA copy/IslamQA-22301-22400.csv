22302,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22302,Types of Woman Not to Marry in Islam,Are there any instances in Islam where it is permissible to marry a woman in some cases and it is not permissible to marry the same woman in other cases?,"Types of woman not to marry in Islam:
•	A woman who is in `Iddah.
•	A woman who has committed fornication or adultery until she repents and completes her `Iddah.
•	A woman whom you have divorced three times until she has been married to another man in a valid marriage.
•	A woman who is in Ihram.
•	Two sisters at the same time.
•	A woman and her maternal or paternal aunt at the same time.
•	More than four women at one time.",,"Praise be to Allah.
It is prohibited to marry a woman who is in `Iddah following the end of a marriage by divorce or death to another man, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“And do not consummate the marriage until the term prescribed is fulfilled.” [Al-Baqarah 2:235]
The wisdom behind that is that there is the possibility that she might be pregnant [from the first husband], and it would result in the sperm being mixed and the lineage being confused (i.e., if he were to marry her before the ‘Iddah was over).

It is prohibited to marry a woman who has committed fornication or adultery if she is known to have  done that, until she repents and completes her `Iddah, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“and the adulteress –fornicatress, none marries her except an adulterer — fornicator or a Mushrik]. Such a thing is prohibited to the believers (of Islamic Monotheism).” [Al-Nisa' 24:3]

It is prohibited for a man to marry a woman whom he has divorced three times until she has been married to another man in a valid marriage which has been consummated, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“The divorce is twice … And if he has divorced her (the third time), then she is not lawful unto him thereafter until she has married another husband…” [Al-Baqarah 2:229-230]

It is prohibited to marry a woman who is in the state of Ihram for Hajj or `Umrah until she has exited the state of Ihram. 
It is prohibited to marry to two sisters at the same time, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“Forbidden to you (for marriage) are: … and to combine two sisters (in marriage, simultaneously).” [Al-Nisa' 4:23]

It is also prohibited to marry a woman and her paternal or maternal aunt at the same time, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not be married to a woman and her paternal aunt or a woman and her maternal aunt at the same time.” (Al-Bukhari and Muslim)

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained the reason behind that when he said, “If you do that, then you have broken the ties of kinship.” That is because of the jealousy that exists between co-wives, and if one of them is related to the other, the ties of kinship between them will be cut. But if a woman is divorced and her `Iddah is over, then her sister, paternal aunt and maternal aunt become permissible for marriage (to that man), because the reason for the prohibition has ceased to exist. 

It is prohibited to marry more than four women at one time, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“then marry (other) women of your choice, two or three, or four.” [Al-Nisa' 4:3]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded those who were married to more than four women to divorce some of them when they entered Islam.

22305,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22305,Which Games Are Haram in Islam?,"I read a hadith which says, “Whoever plays with dice, it is as if he dipped his hand in the flesh and blood of a pig.” And I read that what this means is that playing with dice is haram. So an important question came to my mind, namely, are all kinds of games haram, even if they are beneficial especially since there are Islamic games which are based on use of dice? Are all these games haram? Or does the prohibition apply only to specific games? Please explain this matter, may Allah reward you with good.","There are games which are specifically forbidden in the texts such as playing with dice. There are games which are neither enjoined nor forbidden in the texts and they are of two types: 1- The games which include something that is haram such as games that involve statues or images of living beings, or which are accompanied by music. 2- The games which do not involve anything haram, and which usually do not lead to it, like most of the games we see of football (soccer), volleyball and table-tennis etc.","Types of games


Types of games which do not help in jihad


Kinds of games which are neither enjoined nor forbidden


Conditions of allowing the games which do not involve anything haram","Praise be to Allah.Types of games
Games fall into two categories: 

Games which help in jihad for the sake of Allah, whether that is physical jihad (fighting) or verbal jihaa (i.e., knowledge), such as swimming, shooting, horse-riding, and games which involve developing one’s abilities and Islamic knowledge, etc. 

These games are mustahabb and the one who engages in them will be rewarded so long as his intention is good and he seeks to support the religion thereby. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Shoot, O Bani Adnan, for your father was an archer.” Shooting or archery includes by analogy all similar actions. 

Games which do not help in jihad. 

Types of games which do not help in jihad
There are two types of games which do not help in jihad. 

Games which are specifically forbidden in the texts, such as playing with dice as mentioned in the question. These games should be avoided by the Muslim. 
Games which are neither enjoined nor forbidden in the texts. 

Kinds of games which are neither enjoined nor forbidden
There are two kinds of games which are neither enjoined nor forbidden:  

Games which include something that is haram, such as games that involve statues or images of living beings, or which are accompanied by music, or games which lead to arguments and conflicts among people and result in their saying or doing something bad. These come under the prohibition because of the haram consequences to which they lead or because they are a means to something that is haram. If something is the means that usually leads to something that is haram, then we should refrain from it. 
Games which do not involve anything haram, and which usually do not lead to it, like most of the games we see of football (soccer), volleyball and table-tennis etc. 

Conditions of allowing the games which do not involve anything haram
These games are permissible subject to the following restrictions:

They should be free of gambling, i.e., betting between the players. 
They should not form an obstacle to the obligatory remembrance of Allah, or to prayer, or to any obligatory act of worship, such as honouring one’s parents. 
They should not take up a lot of the player’s time, let alone taking up all of his time or causing him to be known among the people for that, or becoming his job, because then there is the fear that the ayah (interpretation of the meaning) “Who took their religion as an amusement and play, and the life of the world deceived them. So this Day We shall forget them” [al-A’raf 7:51] may become applicable to him. 
The last condition does not have a set limit, but should be referred to what is customary among the Muslims; whatever they regard as excessive is not allowed. A person should set a limit for the time spent playing and for the time spent in serious pursuits; if (the time devoted to playing) is half or one-third or one-quarter, then this is too much.

22306,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22306,Those who were not able to continue following the imaam in Friday prayers because the electricity was cut off,"A group of people were praying Jumu’ah in the basement of the mosque, and during the prayer the electricity was cut off and they could no longer hear the imaam. One of the worshippers stepped forward and led them in the rest of the prayer. What is the ruling on their prayer, knowing that he completed the prayer as Jumu’ah (i.e., two rak’ahs)? 

What would be the ruling if no one had stepped forward to lead them? Should each person have completed the prayer on his own? If that is permissible then should it be completed as Zuhr (four rak’ahs) or Jumu’ah (two rak’ahs), since they had listened to the khateeb and had started the prayer with the imaam and prayed one rak’ah with him?",,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          If the situation was as described by 
          the questioner, then the prayer of all of them is valid, because whoever 
          catches up with one rak’ah of Jumu’ah has prayed Jumu’ah, as it says 
          in the saheeh hadeeth narrated from the Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). If one of them had not 
          stepped forward and they had each prayed the final rak’ah alone, that 
          would have been OK, as in the case of one who joins the prayer in the 
          second rak’ah with the imaam, then makes up the other rak’ah by himself 
          – because of the general meaning of the hadeeth in which the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever catches up

22309,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22309,Advice to the Muslims in the West,What advice can you give to the Muslims in the west in the current situation in which the Muslim ummah finds itself? How can we fulfil our Islamic duties and please Allaah?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    1-Our advice to our Muslim 
    brothers who are living in the west – now – is the same as the advice that 
    Allaah gave to the first and the last, which is to fear Allaah and to do 
    that which is enjoined by Allaah and His Messenger  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him), and to avoid that which is forbidden by Allaah and 
    His Messenger.

    2-Do not stay there, except for 
    those of you who are forced to stay or who need to do so, because they have 
    no other place to go, or because they are sick and need treatment, or they 
    are active in da’wah, calling people to Islam; or if you are natives of that 
    land and can practise your religion openly. You know your situation better 
    than we do and you have seen for yourselves how the west has shown its true 
    colours with regard to so-called religious freedom and freedom of 
    self-expression. That has become permissible for all religions except Islam, 
    and for all people except the Muslims; the heads of some of these states 
    have even dared to issue laws forbidding Muslim women to wear hijab in 
    public schools.

    3-If you have no alternative but 
    to stay in those countries, then strive not to raise your children there; 
    send them to a Muslim country, to their families or to Islamic centres that 
    will take care of them and educate them. No matter how great the corruption 
    in Muslim countries, it cannot compare to the kufr and permissiveness that 
    exists in the west, except in a few rare cases.

    4-You have to present a correct 
    image of Islam by adhering to its rituals, morals and ways. Many countries 
    were won over by Muslim merchants who dealt in a good and kind manner with 
    people, so that the gave a good image of Islam and countries became Muslim 
    at their hands whose inhabitants number in the tens of millions.

    5-It is not permissible for you 
    to look for ward to dilute the rulings of Islam and to make compromises in 
    order to please the west and its people. Rather you should feel proud of 
    your religion and adhere to the guidance of your Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him), no matter who disagrees with you. You see 
    how the followers of deviant ideas and perversions feel proud of their 
    principles and ideas and proclaim them openly with no embarrassment. The 
    followers of truth have more right to do that.

    6-Be united in adhering to the 
    truth and in defending the truth; do not become divided and lose your 
    strength, thus enabling your enemy to defeat you. And do not show your 
    differences openly in front of the kuffaar. Advise one another in private 
    and not in plain view of others.

    7-Do not hesitate to be involved 
    in newspapers, magazines, broadcasting and all kinds of media – within 
    Islamic guidelines – and let your participation be with a purpose, namely to 
    show the true face of Islam. Defend the honour of your Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him), for many kaafirs may be receptive and 
    may respond to a kind word or be influenced by strong evidence.

    8-You have to develop strong ties 
    with the scholars and shaykhs whose knowledge is trustworthy, through all 
    available means. Rid yourselves of ignorance about your faith so that you 
    may dispel the ignorance of others in turn. Introduce Islam to the public, 
    free of all impurities. 

    9-Visit the Holy Land of Allaah – 
    Makkah al-Mukarramah – for Hajj and ‘Umrah, in order to strengthen your 
    faith and form strong ties with the scholars and shaykhs. We often see 
    Muslims from all corners of the earth, but rarely from the west. So strive 
    to do this and cooperate in organizing trips, and you will see a great deal 
    of good in sha Allah.

    10-Finally, strive to 
    obey and worship Allaah, and take good care of your sons and daughters; 
    strive to form strong bonds between family members.

    We ask Allaah to help you to do that which pleases Him and to 
    help you to obey Him and worship Him well.",Islam Q&A
22311,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22311,The importance of learning Usool al-Fiqh for the one who wants to learn fiqh,"If a seeker of knowledge wants to learn fiqh, can he do without learning usool al-fiqh (the bases of fiqh)?",,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen 
          (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked this question and he replied 
          as follows: 
 
          If a seeker of knowledge wants to be a scholar of fiqh 
          then he must combine fiqh and usool al-fiqh in order to be erudite and 
          a specialist in that field. Otherwise you may know fiqh without knowing 
          its usool (bases), but you cannot know usool al-fiqh and become a faqeeh 
          without knowing fiqh. In other words, it is not possible for the faqeeh 
          to do without usool al-fiqh or for the usooli (the one who knows usool 
          al-fiqh) to do without fiqh if he wants to learn fiqh. Hence the scholars 
          of usool differed as to whether it is better for the seeker of knowledge 
          to start with usool al-fiqh so that he can build his knowledge of fiqh 
          on that basis, or to start with fiqh because that is needed, i.e., people 
          need to know that with regard to their worship and dealings with others 
          even before they learn usool al-fiqh. The second is more correct and 
          is that which is usually followed.","From Fataawa al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthyameen, Kitaab al-‘Ilm, p. 190"

What is the correct view of the books of the salaf (may Allaah have mercy on them) as compared with the books of the modern daa’iyahs and thinkers?,,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah 
          have mercy on him and raise his status among the guided) was asked this 
          question and he answered as follows: 
 
          I think that basing da’wah on the Book of Allaah and 
          the Sunnah of His Messenger 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) comes above all else. This 
          is the view of all of us, beyond a doubt. After that comes that which 
          has been narrated from the Rightly-Guided khaleefahs, the Sahaabah and 
          the imams of Islam among the earlier generations (the salaf). 
 
          With regard to what the later and contemporary scholars 
          speak about, it deals with things that have happened more recently, 
          which they know better about. If a person takes from their books that 
          which will benefit him in that respect, then he will have gained a great 
          deal. We know that the contemporary scholars have taken the knowledge 
          that they have from those who came before them, so let us also take 
          from the same source as they did. But there are some matters which emerged 
          later, that they understand better, because these issues did not arise 
          at the time of the salaf in the same manner. Hence I think that one 
          should combine the two good things, relying primarily on the Book of 
          Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and secondly on the words 
          of the Rightly-Guided khaleefahs and the Sahaabah and the imams of the 
          Muslims, then on what has been written by the contemporary scholars 
          who write about things that did not happen in previous times and were 
          not specifically known to the salaf.","From Fataawa al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, Kitaab al-‘Ilm, p. 216-217"

Is setting an appointed time each week for giving religious lectures or holding study circles a form of reprehensible bid’ah (innovation), on the grounds that that seeking knowledge is a form of worship? The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not set appointed times for this act of worship. Following on from that, if a group of brothers agree to meet in the mosque on a particular night each month to perform qiyaam al-layl, is that bid’ah? Please quote the evidence (daleel) (concerning that).",,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah

          Setting aside a regular day for giving lectures or holding 
          a study circle is not a reprehensible bid’ah. Rather it is permissible, 
          as it is permissible to set aside a day in schools and institutes to 
          study fiqh, tafseer, etc. Undoubtedly seeking Islamic knowledge is a 
          form of worship but setting aside a particular day for it is something 
          which is dictated by our circumstances. It is in our interests to set 
          aside a specific day for that so that people will not be put in a difficult 
          position. Seeking knowledge is not an act of worship which is linked 
          to a specific time, rather it is to be done at times which are convenient. 
          But if a special day is set aside and is regarded as being solely for 
          seeking knowledge, then this is bid’ah. 
 
          With regard to a group agreeing to meet on a specific 
          night for qiyaam al-layl, this is bid’ah, because it is not prescribed 
          for a group to perform qiyaam al-layl together. But if this is done 
          occasionally and unintentionally, as happened in the case of the Prophet

          without any knowledge, as Allaah says here, “with sure knowledge”. 
          How can a person call others to something of which he has no knowledge? 
          Whoever calls people to Allaah without knowledge is saying things about 
          Allaah which he does not know. Knowledge is the first step towards da’wah. 
 
          But it is possible to combine knowledge and da’wah from 
          beginning to end. If you cannot combine them, then you should start 
          with (seeking) knowledge, because that is the basis on which da’wah 
          rests. Al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his Saheeh, 
          in the tenth chapter of Kitaab al-‘Ilm (the Book of Knowledge), 
          Baab al-‘Ilm qabla al-Qawl wa’l-‘Aml (Chapter on (acquiring) 
          knowledge before speaking or acting). He quoted as evidence for that 
          the aayah in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
 
          “So know (O Muhammad) that Laa ilaaha illallaah (none 
          has the right to be worshipped but Allaah), and ask forgiveness for 
          your sin, and also for (the sin of) believing men and believing women. 
          And Allaah knows well your moving about, and your place of rest (in 
          your homes)”[Muhammad 47:19]
 
          He said: so start with knowledge. 
 
          Whoever thinks that he cannot combine (seeking) knowledge 
          and da’wah is mistaken, because a person can be learning and can also 
          call his family, neighbours and the people in his town to Allaah whilst 
          he is still learning. 
 
          People nowadays are in need – indeed it is essential 
          – of deeply rooted knowledge that will be established in their hearts, 
          based on the sources of sharee’ah. With regard to the superficial knowledge 
          by which a person knows just a little about the issues that he comes 
          across, as the common people know, without any knowledge of its principles 
          or what it is based upon, this is very limited knowledge which does 
          not enable a person to defend the truth at a time of necessity in the 
          face of the arguments posed by those who propagate falsehood. 
 
          What I advise the Muslim youth to do is to concentrate 
          their efforts on seeking knowledge whilst also calling people to Allaah 
          as much as they can and in a manner that will not prevent them from 
          seeking knowledge, because seeking knowledge is jihad for the sake of 
          Allaah. Hence the scholars said that if a person who is able to earn 
          a living is kept from doing so by his pursuit of knowledge, he should 
          be given zakaah, because that is a kind of jihad for the sake of Allaah, 
          unlike one who does not work in order to concentrate on worship, who 
          should not be given zakaah because he is able to work.","From Fataawa al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, Kitaab al-‘Ilm, p. 168-170"

          No one doubts that these tapes are one 
          of the means of acquiring knowledge. We do not deny that Allaah has 
          blessed us through these tapes from which we have gained a great deal 
          of knowledge, because they have brought us the words of the scholars 
          no matter where they may be. 
 
          Here in our homes, there is a huge distance 
          between us and this scholar, but it is easy for us to hear his words 
          via this tape. This is one of the blessings that Allaah has bestowed 
          upon us. Indeed it is proof both for us and against us, for knowledge 
          has spread widely through these tapes. 
 
          With regard to how we may benefit from 
          them: 
 
          This depends on the situation of the 
          person himself. Some people may benefit from them whilst driving, others 
          may listen to them whilst eating lunch or dinner, or drinking coffee. 
 
          The point is that the way in which benefit 
          is derived from them depends on the individual himself; we cannot lay 
          down any general rules.","From Fataawa al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, Kitaab al-‘Ilm,  p. 193"

    if that is easier for him, let him begin with that which is easier. We also 
    advise him to pay more attention to what he has already memorised than 
    paying attention to memorising a great deal, because paying attention to

22339,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22339,Riba in Islam: Permissible?,What is the ruling regarding riba as permissible in Islam? Thank you very much.,"Riba in Islam is not permissible according to the Quran and Sunnah, and definitive scholarly consensus. Riba is one of the major sins. For more, see the detailed answer","Is riba permissible in Islam?


The ruling on those who regard riba as permissible","Praise be to Allah.Is riba permissible in Islam?
Riba is forbidden according to the Quran and Sunnah, and definitive scholarly consensus. Whoever regards it as permissible is a kafir, because the basic principle is that whoever rejects something on which there is obvious scholarly consensus is guilty of kufr. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“The belief that the well-known obligations are obligatory and that the well-known prohibitions are forbidden is one of the most important basic principles of faith, and the one who rejects that is a kafir according to scholarly consensus.” (Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 12/497)
Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Whoever believes that something is permissible when there is consensus that it is forbidden and the ruling thereon is well known among the Muslims and the texts leave no room for doubt concerning it – such as pig meat, adultery and the like, concerning which there is no difference of scholarly opinion – is guilty of kufr.” (Al-Mughni, 12/276)
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“But nowadays Islam has spread and the knowledge that zakah is obligatory is well known to the elite and commoners alike; the scholar and the ignorant are both aware of it. So no one has any excuse for misinterpreting (the texts) and denying it. The same applies to everyone who denies any matter of religion on which the ummah is agreed, if knowledge of it is widespread, such as the five daily prayers, fasting the month of Ramadan, doing ghusl to cleanse oneself of janabah (major ritual impurity), the prohibition on adultery, alcohol and marrying mahrams, and other rulings, unless he is new in Islam and does not know its rulings, in which case if he denies something out of ignorance he is not guilty of kufr… But with regard to matters on which there is consensus but which may only be known by those with specialized knowledge, such as the prohibition on being married to a woman and her paternal aunt or maternal aunt at the same time, or that the one who kills with intent cannot inherit (from his victim), or that the grandmother is entitled to one-sixth (of the estate), and other such rulings, then whoever denies them is not guilty of kufr, rather he is to be excused because knowledge of these things is not widespread among the common folk.”  
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“The ruling on riba is that it is haraam according to the Quran and Sunnah and scholarly consensus. It is classified as one of the major sins, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“but whoever returns (to riba), such are the dwellers of the Fire — they will abide therein” [al-Baqarah 2:275] 
“And if you do not do it, then take a notice of war from Allah and His Messenger” [al-Baqarah 2:279]
And because the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed the one who consumes riba, the one who pays it, the two who witness it and the one who writes it down. So it is a major sin. 
There is scholarly consensus that riba is forbidden, hence whoever denies that it is forbidden although he lives in a Muslim environment is an apostate, because this is one of the obviously forbidden things on which there is consensus. 
But if we say this, does that mean that the scholars are agreed on all forms of riba? The answer is no; there is a difference of opinion concerning some forms of it. This is like what we have said about zakah being obligatory according to consensus, but despite that there is no consensus on every form of it. They differed concerning the zakat on camels and oxen that are used for farming or irrigation, and they differed concerning the zakah on jewellery and the like, but in general the scholars are agreed that riba is haram and is a major sin.” (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’ ‘ala Zad al-Mustanqi’, 8/387)
The ruling on those who regard riba as permissible
Based on that, it may be said: 
Whoever denies that riba is forbidden is a kafir, because the fact that it is forbidden is one of the matters indicated by the texts, and the scholars are obviously agreed that it is haram, and this is well known among the Muslims. 
But if he denies that a specific form of riba is forbidden, concerning which there is a difference of opinion among the scholars or there is no consensus that it is obviously forbidden, then he is not a kafir; rather his case should be examined further. He may be a mujtahid who will be rewarded for his ijtihad, or he may be excused, or he may be an evildoer if by regarding this as permissible he is following his own whims and desires.

22341,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22341,The reason why it is forbidden to eat meat without draining the blood,"Is there an obvious reason why it is forbidden to eat animals that are not slaughtered according to sharee’ah, such as those killed by electric shock or shot with a gun, etc.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Say (O Muhammad): I find not in that which has been 
    revealed to me anything forbidden to be eaten by one who wishes to eat it, 
    unless it be Maytah (a dead animal) or blood poured forth (by slaughtering 
    or the like), or the flesh of swine (pork); for that surely, is impure or 
    impious (unlawful) meat (of an animal) which is slaughtered as a sacrifice 
    for others than Allaah (or has been slaughtered for idols, or on which 
    Allaah’s Name has not been mentioned while slaughtering). But whosoever is 
    forced by necessity without wilful disobedience, nor transgressing due 
    limits; (for him) certainly, your Lord is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful”

    [al-An’aam 6:145]

    Blood is the reason why it is forbidden to eat meat that has 
    not been slaughtered according to sharee’ah. Our sharee’ah intends that the 
    slaughtered animal should be drained of blood as completely as possible, and 
    that is because of the extreme harm that would result from eating its 
    blood. 

    It does not make sense, and it is unacceptable to suggest, 
    that Islam would set out all these conditions to get rid of the blood of the 
    slaughtered animal in the manner prescribed, then allow us to drink or eat 
    blood after it is drained from the animal. For this reason it is a definite 
    fact that Islam has forbidden blood as a means of nutrition for man. Rather 
    this prohibition is a clear sign of the wisdom and purpose of sharee’ah in 
    purifying the animal by draining the blood from it because blood is one of 
    the most evil and unlawful kinds of food, which the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) was sent to abolish.  

    “he allows them as lawful At-Tayyibaat (i.e. all good and 
    lawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods), and prohibits 
    them as unlawful Al-Khabaa’ith (i.e. all evil and unlawful as regards 
    things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods)”

    [al-A’raaf 7:157 – interpretation of the meaning]

    Al-Tabari said in his Tafseer: “ The phrase ‘blood 
    poured forth’ means blood that flows copiously. This is how Allaah 
    described the blood when He told His slaves that it is haraam. ‘Ikrimah 
    said: were it not for this aayah, the Muslims would gone to extremes in 
    avoiding the blood that remains in the veins as the Jews do. Al-Maawardi 
    said that with regard to blood that is not ‘poured forth’, if it has 
    solidified in the veins, as in the liver and spleen, then it is halaal, 
    because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “Two kinds of dead meat and two kinds of blood have been permitted to us…” 

    The reason why the blood that is “poured forth” is forbidden 
    to us is because of the information that has become well known and well 
    established nowadays among the doctors and those who carry out medical tests 
    and study microscopic creatures, which is that blood is considered to be the 
    optimum environment for the growth of germs. So if a person drinks blood it 
    is as if he has drunk a “farm” for growing germs, in which the germs can 
    multiply and grow, producing lethal poisons which, as is well known, have 
    extremely harmful effects which result in germs invading the human body 
    resulting in the person contracting contagious and lethal diseases. 

    If it is said that cooking the blood and eating it will 
    surely kill these bacteria and microbes and put an end to them whilst 
    preserving the hoped-for nutritional benefits of the blood, our answer is 
    that some of these toxins cannot be altered by boiling and changed in such a 
    manner that they become beneficial to the body. There are some that do not 
    change at all, rather they remain lethal poisons even after being boiled, or 
    the heat may alter them in such a way that they become even more lethal and 
    harmful. 

    With regard to the benefits expected by the one who drinks 
    blood thinking that it is a nutritious substance that strengthens the body, 
    these benefits are non-existent, if we examine the composition of blood. 
    Blood is very difficult to digest, so much so that if some of it is poured 
    into a man’s stomach, he will vomit immediately, or it will come out in his 
    stools without having been digested, in the form of a black substance. The 
    reason why it is so hard to digest and it turns the stools black is the 
    presence of the red substance (haemoglobin) which is basically formed of 
    iron. As the blood passes through the digestive tract and as time passes, it 
    starts to disintegrate and break down, and thus it also harms the body. If 
    it were said that cooking also helps to break down the components of blood 
    and make it easier to digest and benefit from its nutritional value, our 
    answer is that boiling solidifies the proteins in the blood and makes it 
    even more difficult to digest, more harmful and less beneficial. 

    After hundreds of scientific experiments and huge 
    advancements in modern science, carrying out blood tests and precise 
    scientific research in this field, it has become indisputably clear to all 
    those who are concerned with human health of all nationalities and 
    specialties that the great harm done to health by eating blood or cooking it 
    and using it all boil down to the fact that drinking blood is ingesting a 
    lethal poison. This is clear from the following scientific facts: 

    1 – Blood is basically composed of two basic elements, namely 
    water which represents 90% of the liquid in which the components of blood 
    swim (which is known as plasma). The rest is formed of blood cells and other 
    elements. The one who wants to drink blood or cook it and eat it does so 
    because he wants to consume something with a high or regular nutritional 
    value. But these scientific facts prove that he would have to drink such a 
    huge amount of blood in order to avail himself of a small amount of blood 
    protein and a little bit of iron that it is not worth the risk of exposing 
    himself to the dangers that result from that. 

    In brief, blood is the opposite of what people think, it is 
    very poor in nutritional values. Therefore the fact that it is forbidden 
    does not mean that the Muslims are being deprived of any major nutritional 
    benefit. 

    2 – Major harm may result from this small amount of blood 
    protein mixed with very harmful and poisonous elements, which means that 
    ingesting it poses a great risk and puts a person in danger. Foremost among 
    these dangers is the poisonous gas with which blood is filled, namely carbon 
    dioxide which flows in venous blood from all parts of the body. 

    Because the one who drinks blood takes it from the animal 
    when it is full of carbon dioxide, which is a gas that kills by 
    asphyxiation. When a person dies of asphyxiation, it is because of the 
    accumulation of this gas in his blood, the lethal effects of which result in 
    death. 

    So it is obvious that repeatedly drinking blood which is 
    filled with carbon dioxide, on the part of one who is accustomed to this 
    practice, will lead to harmful results depending on the extent to which this 
    gas is present in the animal’s blood and the extent to which the body of the 
    drinker is susceptible to it. 

    What we have mentioned here are only the effects that result 
    from the components of blood on the one who drinks it or eats it after 
    cooking it. We have also mentioned other extremely harmful effects which are 
    directly connected to the specific functions that Allaah has created in 
    blood and the roles that it plays in the animal’s body, functions that 
    cannot be performed unless the blood is in a liquid, flowing state. If we 
    were to content ourselves with the above bad effects of using blood for 
    food, that would be sufficient to make any nation that appreciates knowledge 
    to promulgate laws banning this practice, even if that nation was kaafir.

If you catch up with a person who is making up the rak`ah that he missed and pray with him, then you should pray it as Zhuhr and not as Jumu`ah.",,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh ‘Abd Al-‘Aziz Ibn ‘Abd-Allah Ibn Baz (may Allah Have Mercy on Him) said:
“He has to complete it as Zhuhr because the Jumu`ah prayer is over. You can catch Friday prayer up with one rak`ah if you catch up with the second rak`ah prayed with the imam, then you can pray it as Jumu`ah. But if you do not come until after the salam or after the second rak`ah, during the Tashahhud or when the imam is prostrating in the second rak`ah, then you should not pray it as Jumu`ah, but rather as Zhuhr. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever catches up with one rak`ah of Jumu`ah, let him add one more to it and his prayer will be complete.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 482; al-Nasai, 554; Ibn Majah, 1113)
The meaning of this hadith is that if he only catches up with less than a rak`ah then he has not caught up with Jumu`ah so he has to pray it as Zhuhr. This is what is prescribed in Islam. 
If he catches up with a person who is making up the rak`ah that he missed, and prays with him, then he should pray it as Zhuhr and not as Jumu`ah.
It should also be noted that this should be after the sun has passed its zenith. But if Jumu`ah prayer was offered before the sun reached its zenith, he should not pray Zhuhr until after the sun has passed its zenith, because it is permissible to pray Jumu`ah before the sun reaches its zenith , in the “sixth hour”, according to the correct scholarly view. But it is preferable and more on the safe side to pray it after the sun has passed its zenith, as is the view of the majority of scholars. But in the case of Zhuhr, it is not permissible to pray it until after the sun has passed its zenith , according to the consensus of the Muslims.

          Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih ibn ‘Uthaymeen 
          (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked this question, and he replied 
          as follows: 
 
          There are some risks involved in interpreting 
          the Qur’aan according to modern theories. That is because, if we interpret 
          the Qur’aan according to those theories, then other theories are produced 
          which contradict them, this implies that the Qur’aan will be incorrect 
          in the view of the enemies of Islam. The Muslims would say that the 
          error is in the understanding of the one who interpreted the Qur’aan 
          in that manner, but the enemies of Islam are always watching for an 
          opportunity to attack Islam. Hence we must exercise the utmost caution 
          against rushing into interpreting the Qur’aan according to these scientific 
          matters. We must leave these alone and let matters take their course. 
          If it is proven that some of these theories are correct, we do not need 
          to say that the Qur’aan has already proven it, the Qur’aan was revealed 
          for the purpose of worship and moral, and for people to ponder its meanings. 
          Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
 
          “(This is) a Book (the Qur’aan) which 
          We have sent down to you, full of blessings, that they may ponder over 
          its Verses, and that men of understanding may remember”
 
          [Saad 38:29]
 
          It was not revealed concerning these 
          matters which are subject to experimentation and which people study 
          as part of their scientific quest. It may also be very dangerous to 
          apply the aayahs of the Qur’aan to these theories. For example, Allaah 
          said (interpretation of the meaning): 
 
          “O assembly of jinn and men! If you have 
          power to pass beyond the zones of the heavens and the earth, then pass 
          beyond (them)! But you will never be able to pass them, except with 
          authority (from Allaah)!”
 
          [al-Rahmaan 55:33]
 
          When man reached the moon, some people 
          started to interpret this aayah and apply it to this event of reaching 
          the moon, and they said that what was meant by authority was science 
          and that by their science they had passed beyond the zones of the earth 
          and escaped the gravitational pull (of the earth). This is wrong; it 
          is not permissible to interpret the Qur’aan in this way. What this implies 
          is that you are testifying that thius is what Allaah meant. This is 
          a serious testimony and you will be questioned concerning that.  
 
          Whoever ponders the meaning of this aayah 
          will find that this interpretation is incorrect, because this aayah 
          comes after the aayahs (interpretation of the meaning): 
 
          “Whatsoever is on it (the earth) will 
          perish.
 
           And the Face of your Lord full 
          of Majesty and Honour will remain forever.
 
          Then which of the Blessings of your Lord 
          will you both (jinn and men) deny?”
 
          [al-Rahmaan 55:26, 28]
 
          So we ask: did these people manage to 
          pass beyond the zones of the heavens? 
 
          The answer is no, for Allaah says (interpretation 
          of the meaning): 
 
          “If you have power to pass beyond 
          the zones of the heavens and the earth, then pass beyond (them)!”
 
          [al-Rahmaan 55:33]
 
          Secondly: has there been sent against 
          them flames of fire and copper? 
 
          The answer is no. So the aayah cannot 
          be interpreted in this manner. We say that they reached what they reached 
          through science and experimentation. But for us to distort the meaning 
          of the Qur’aan and to try to make it fit this event, this is not correct 
          and is not permitted.","From Fataawa al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, Kitaab al-‘Ilm, p. 150-152)"

They quote as evidence in support of this the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Let there be behind me those among you who are wise and mature.” Is this permissible?",,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          This is the view of some scholars, who say that it is 
          better for young boys to form rows behind the men. But this opinion 
          is subject to dispute. The more correct view is that if they get there 
          first, it is not permissible to make them sit further back. If they 
          reach the first or second row first, those who come after them should 
          not make them sit further back, because they got there first and that 
          gives them the right over those who did not get there first. So it is 
          not permissible to make them sit further back, because of the general 
          meaning of the ahaadeeth concerning this matter, and because making 
          them sit further back would put them off coming to the prayer and from 
          competing in that – and this is not appropriate. 
 
          But if a group of people arrive together, because they 
          are traveling together or for some other reason, then the men should 
          form the first rows, the boys behind them, and the women – if there 
          are women present – should form rows behind them. This is when a group 
          is all together. But for older people who come later to make the youngsters 
          move and then take their places is not permissible, as we have mentioned. 
 
          With regard to the hadeeth of the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Let there be behind me 
          those among you who are wise and mature” – this is meant to encourage 
          people who are wise and mature to hasten to the prayer and to be in 
          the forefront of the people. It does not mean that those who arrived 
          before them should be made to move for them, because that goes against 
          the shar’i evidence that we have mentioned.","Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah li Samaahat al-Shaykh al-‘Allaamah ibn Baaz , part 12, p. 399"

Is this permissible, or should they just pray to Allah SWT for help individually?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Undoubtedly in the Qur’aan there is healing for mankind; and 
    it was narrated that in certain verses and soorahs there is healing and 
    protection for man, and that they can ward off bad things, by Allaah’s 
    leave, such as al-Faatihah, al-Mi’wadhatayn, Aayat al-Kursiy and Soorat 
    al-Ikhlaas. Whoever recites some aayahs or soorahs, and repeats them three 
    or seven times, as needed, without persisting in a specific number that was 
    not referred to in sharee’ah, then there is no reason why he should not do 
    that, so long as he believes that healing is in the Hand of Allaah Who has 
    created in the Qur’aan healing for mankind. 

    To that may be added ruqyah using du’aa’s narrated from the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), such as the words, 
    “Adhhib al-ba’s Rabb an-naas, wa’shfi anta al-Shaafi, laa shifaa’a illa 
    shifaa’uka shifaa’ laa yughaadir saqaman (Take away the pain, O Lord of 
    mankind, and grant healing, for You are the Healer, and there is no healing 
    but Your healing that leaves no trace of sickness).” (Narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari, 5243; Muslim, 4061) 

    And one may do as the great Sahaabi advised, when someone who 
    was suffering pain complained to him. He said: “Put your hand on the part of 
    your body that is hurting and say, “Bismillaah” three times, then say seven 
    times, ‘A’oodhu Billaahi wa qudratihi min sharri ma ajidu wa uhaadhir 
    (I seek refuge with Allaah and His Power from the evil of what I am 
    suffering from and what I am worried about).” If one does that, and recites 
    other du’aa’s that have been narrated from the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) in saheeh reports, that will be very good. 

    If trust in Allaah is combined with thinking of the meanings 
    of the verses and du’aa’s that are being recited, and both the one who is 
    doing ruqya and the one for whom it is done are righteous people, that will 
    be very beneficial, if Allaah wills. 

    Based on the above, gathering in the manner mentioned in the 
    question and reciting “Qul huwa Allaahu ahad” a certain number of 
    times (10,000 times) is not something which is prescribed in Islam, so you 
    should be content with doing that which is narrated in the Sunnah.

22369,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22369,"Conditions which must be met by a mahram in order to travel with him, and for there to be no khulwah","My question is that is Mahram subject to age? I. E. after a certain age (say 0 to 9,10 or 70s and 80s ect) is conditions of mahram applicable? What is the ruling on Mahram when Janazas are concern? (I.e. visiting a Janaza ect)Is same conditions applicable? Please explain?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    This question covers three topics: 

    1 – The age at which a person is considered to be a valid 
    mahram for a woman: 

    It was said that with regard to the mahram with whom a woman 
    may travel, he should be a Muslim, male, an adult and of sound mind, and 
    someone whom a woman is permanently forbidden to marry, such as her father, 
    brother, paternal uncle, brother through breast-feeding (radaa’ah), 
    father-in-law, etc. 
2-
    With regard to being 
    alone with a non-mahram woman (khulwah) (inside the city, i.e., not 
    traveling), this is avoided by the presence of an adult mahram or an adult 
    in front of whom they feel shy. The presence of a young child is not 
    sufficient. Khulwah may also be avoided by the presence of another woman or 
    another man, so long as there are no grounds for suspicion and there is no 
    fear of danger. 

    (al-Fataawa al-Jaami’a li’l-Mar’ah, 3/935, 938) 

    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said (9/109): “If a 
    man is alone with a non-mahram woman, without there being a third person 
    present, this is haraam according to the consensus of the scholars. 
    Similarly, if the person with them is one of whom they do not feel shy 
    because he is young, that does not avoid the forbidden khulwah.” 

    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    said: “The person through whom khulwah is avoided must be an adult; the 
    presence of a child is not sufficient. What some women think, that having a 
    child with her avoids khulwah, is mistaken thinking.” (Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 
    10/52) 

    3- With regard to women visiting graves, the more correct of the 
    two scholarly views is that visiting graves is not permissible for women.

22373,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22373,Ruling on keeping cats,"I know that cats in Islam are regarded as clean and pure animals but i am not sure what the ruling is on keeping them in the house as pets.
I don't have anything against cats but i feel keeping them in the house and letting them wonder around the kitchen، bedroom etc is unhygienic. Please could you shed some light on this issue.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is permissible in Islam for a person to keep permissible things that no one else has taken possession of before him, such as taking firewood from the desert or wood from the forest. The same applies to taking cats and raising them. One takes possession of a permissible thing by be acquiring it and having it under one's care, provided that it does not belong to anyone. 
Based on the above, we may say that there is nothing wrong with keeping cats which do not belong to anyone, on condition that one feeds them and does not torment them. But if it is proven that they cause some harm, such as if they are ill or one fears that they may transmit disease, then you should not keep them, because “there should be no harming nor reciprocating harm.” So whoever will be harmed by a cat’s presence should not keep one. Similarly, one who is not able to feed a cat should let it eat from the vermin of the earth and not keep it locked up, because of the report  narrated by al-Bukhaari (3223) and Muslim (1507) from ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both), according to which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “A woman was punished because of a cat which she kept locked up until it died, and she entered Hell because of it, because she did not feed it or give it water when she kept it locked up, neither did she let it eat from the vermin of the earth.” For more information see question no. 3004. 
With regard to cats eating food or drinking water, that does not make the food or water naajis (impure), because of the report narrated in Sunan Abi Dawood and elsewhere, which says that a woman brought some hareesah (a kind of food) to ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) and found her praying. (‘Aa’ishah) gestured to her that she should put it down. Then a cat came and ate some of it. When ‘Aa’ishah had finished praying, she ate from where the cat had eaten and said, “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘They (cats) are not naajis (impure), rather they are among those who go around among you (al-tawwaafeena ‘alaykum).’ I saw the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) doing wudoo’ with water from which a cat had drunk.” 
According to another report narrated by Abu Dawood (68) from Kabshah bint Ka’b ibn Maalik, who was married to Ibn Abi Qutaadah, Abu Qutaadah entered and she poured some water for him to do wudoo’. A cat came and drank from the water, and he tipped the vessel for it so that it could drink. Kabshah said: “He saw me looking at him and he said, ‘Do you find it strange, O daughter of my brother?’ I said, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “They (cats) are not naajis (impure), rather they are among those who go around among you (al-tawwaafeena ‘alaykum).”’” These two reports were classed as saheeh by al-Bukhaari, al-Daaraqutni and others, as was stated in al-Talkhees by Ibn Hajar, 1/15. 
“Those who go around among you (al-tawwaafeena ‘alaykum)” means that they are like servants who are with people in their houses, i.e., cats are always with people, in their houses and among their vessels and furnishings, etc., and this is something that cannot be helped. 
So if a cat drinks  from a vessel or eats some of the food, it does not become naajis (impure). The owner has the choice. If he is not put off or if he needs it, he may eat (the food) or drink (the water), because it is taahir (pure), unless it is obvious that it will cause harm. If he is put off by the idea of eating or drinking, then he may leave it. 
But we should point out here that what some people do, paying a great deal of attention to their cats and beautifying them, spending large amounts of money on them, is indicative of a lack of common sense and religious commitment, and exaggeration with regard to leisure, when there are millions of needy Muslims all over the world, let alone the fact that we Muslims should pay attention to making the best use of our time and filling it with worthwhile and beneficial pursuits, far removed from this folly which has come to us from the kaafir west where some people spend more on their cats and dogs than they spend on their own sons and daughters, let alone the poor and needy. They may even bring their pets to stay in fancy hotels and bequeath large amounts of money to them. Praise be to Allah Who has honoured us with Islam and distinguished us from all the other nations. 
We should also point out that selling cats is not allowed, as was narrated in Saheeh Muslim (2933) from Abu’l-Zubayr who said: “I asked Jaabir about the price of a dog or a cat. He said, ‘The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade that.’” For more information see question no. 7004 and 10207.

    This hadeeth was narrated by al-Tirmidhi: ‘Abbaas al-Doori 
    al-Baghdaadi told us, Yahya ibn Abi Bukayr told us, Shareek told us, 
    narrating from ‘Aasim who is Ibn Bahdalah, from Abu Saalih from Abu Hurayrah 
    from the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) who said: 
    “The Fire was stoked for a thousand years until it turned red, then it was 
    stoked for a thousand years until it turned white, then it was stoked for a 
    thousand years until it turned black, and it is intensely black.” 

    And he said: Suwayd told us, ‘Abd-Allaah ibn al-Mubaarak told 
    us, from Shareek, from ‘Aasim, from Abu Saalih or another man, from Abu 
    Hurayrah, a similar report, but he did not attribute it to the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Abu ‘Eesa al-Tirmidhi said: the 
    hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah concerning this is more likely to be mawqoof (i.e., 
    to have an interruption in the chain of narration); I do not know of anyone 
    who attributed it to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) apart from Yahya ibn Abi Bukayr (who narrated it) from Shareek. 

    Al-Albaani said: This Yahya is thiqah (trustworthy) and is 
    accepted in al-Saheehayn, so it is not possible to criticize him, 
    especially since Shareek, who is the son of ‘Abd-Allaah al-Nakha’i al-Qaadi, 
    who has a bad memory, appears in the isnaad and this is the weak point of 
    hadeeth. This is supported by his confusion; sometimes he attributes it to 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and sometimes 
    he does not, and sometimes he is definite in his isnaad and says, “from Abu 
    Saalih”, and sometimes he is uncertain and says, “from Abu Saalih or another 
    man.” These are signs that he is imprecise and does not have a good memory. 
    So no wonder the scholars who had knowledge of men’s biographies classed him 
    as da’eef (weak). So the hadeeth is da’eef, whether it is attributed to the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or not.

Should I repeat the obligatory prayer or is it waived in either case because I have already offered it, joined to the other prayer at the time of the earlier prayer and shortened?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The concession regarding prayer that are connected to travel is that one is allowed to join Zuhr and ‘Asr, and Maghrib and ‘Isha’, at the time of the earlier or later of the two. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not make it a habit to join his prayers on all his journeys; rather he joined prayers sometimes and did not join prayers sometimes, praying each prayer at its own time instead. 
Hence the scholars said: it is better for the traveller not to join his prayers unless he needs to because it will be too difficult for him to do each prayer at its usual time, even though the concession allowing joining of prayers is established for every traveller. 
See al-Mughni, 3/131; al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 4/550-553 
Once it is established that you come under the definition of a traveller, then it becomes permissible to join the prayers, even if you know that you will return to your city before the end of the time for the second prayer, or before the time for it begins, because the evidence indicates that it is permissible for the traveller to join his prayers; so as long as a person is travelling, he may join his prayers.  
In al-Majmoo’ (4/180), al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) mentioned the difference of the scholars; there are two views concerning the issue of a traveller who joins two prayers at the time of the earlier one, but then reaches his destination and is no longer a traveller. Does his joining of the prayers then become invalid, requiring him to repeat the second prayer at its proper time, or not?
 Then al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The more correct of the two scholarly views is that his joining of the prayers does not become invalid, the same as if he were to shorten the prayers and then reach his destination and no longer come under the heading of a traveller. 
Al-Muwaffaq Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (3/140): 
If a person completed two prayers at the time of the earlier one, then the excuse for doing so ceased to exist after he had finished praying, before the time for the later prayer began, that is still sufficient and he does not have to repeat the later prayer when the time for it comes, because his prayer was valid and he discharged his duty to perform it, and that duty no longer applies after that. He discharged his duty at a time when he had an excuse, and it is not invalidated by the fact that the excuse ceases to exist after that. This is like the case of the one who does tayammum, if he finds water after finishing his prayer (he does not have to repeat it). 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about a traveller who joined Zuhr and ‘Asr at the time of the earlier prayer, although he knew that he would reach his destination before the time of ‘Asr. Is this permissible? 
He replied: 
Yes, this is permissible, but if he knows or he thinks it most likely that he will arrive before the time for ‘Asr, then it is better for him not to join the prayers, because there is no need to do so. 
Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 15/422. 
The Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas was asked about the same matter, and they replied:

Duha Prayer Time


The best time for Duha prayer","Praise be to Allah.What is Duha prayer?
Ishraq prayer is Duha (chast) prayer offered at the beginning of its time. These are not two different prayers. It is called Ishraq because it is done immediately after sunrise (shuruq) when the sun has risen to a certain height.  
Shaykh Ibn Baz said: 
“Ishraq prayer is Duha prayer done at the beginning of its time.” Majmu’ Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 11/401 
Duha Prayer Time
The time of Duha prayer is from the time when the sun has risen to a certain height, until just before the time for Zhuhr prayer. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin defined it as being from a quarter of an hour after the sun has risen until ten minutes before Zhur prayer. (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 4/122)
So all of this period is the time for Duha prayer. 
The best time for Duha prayer
“It is better to pray Duha prayer after the sun’s heat has become intense, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘It is preferable to offer Duha prayer when the sun’s heat has become so intense that even the young of the camels feel it.’” Narrated by Muslim, 748 (Ibn Baz: Majmu’ Fatawa, 11/395) 
The scholars defined this as being when one quarter of the day has passed, i.e., halfway between sunrise and Zhuhr prayer. (See Al-Majmu’ by al-Nawawi, 4/36, Al-Mawsu’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 27/224)",Islam Q&A

They are like the gold dinars that the Muslims used during the first century, before they had their own dinars during the reign of ‘Abd al-Malik ibn Marwaan (may Allaah have mercy on him). But that is only permissible when there is a need. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:  
As for a man carrying money with pictures of kings and presidents that the Muslims are faced with nowadays, this is an old issue which the scholars have discussed.  The people used to carry European guineas on which there was a picture of a horse and knight, and they used to carry the French réals on which there was a picture of the head and neck of a bird. What we think about this is that there is no sin on a person who carries it because he has a need to do so, because a person has to carry some money in his pocket, and not allowing the people to do so would cause them hardship. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allaah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you”
[al-Baqarah 2:185] 
“and has not laid upon you in religion any hardship”
[al-Hajj 22:78]
 It was narrated in a saheeh hadeeth that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Religion is very easy and whoever overburdens himself in his religion will not be able to continue in that way. So you should not be extremists, but try to be near to perfection and receive the good tidings that you will be rewarded.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari). And he said to Mu’aadh ibn Jabal and Abu Moosa when he sent them to the Yemen: “Be easy going and not harsh, give glad tidings and do not put people off.” And he said to the people when they rebuked the Bedouin who urinated in the mosque: “Leave him, for you have been sent to be easy going, you have not been sent to be harsh.” (These two reports were also narrated by al-Bukhaari). 
So if a man carries money or an identity card or a driving licence on which there are images, and he needs it or fears that he may need it, there is nothing wrong with that and there is no sin on him in sha Allah, for Allaah knows that he dislikes these images and does not approve of them, and that if he did not need it he would not carry it. 
From Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 2/280 
The Standing Committee was asked the following question: 
There are some issues which cause me a great deal of anxiety, one of which is the issue of the pictures on the money that we have and which we bring into the mosques in our pockets. Is our bringing it into the mosques one of the things that will make the angels leave, so that it is haraam to bring it in? Is this considered to be one of the things that are used in a disrespectful manner? Because images that are treated in a disrespectful manner do not prevent the angels from entering houses. 
The Committee replied: 
The pictures on money are not something that is under your control. You have no choice but to own money, keep it in your house and carry it with you so as to make use of it in buying, selling, giving gifts and charity, paying off debts and other purposes that are prescribed in sharee’ah, so there is no sin on you, even though this money is not usually handled with disrespect because of its value. Rather there is no sin on you, because that is due to necessity. 
From Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 1/485. 
But if what is meant is buying gold coins with paper currency, there is nothing wrong with that if it is hand to hand, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Gold for gold, silver for silver, wheat for wheat, barley for barley, dates for dates and salt for salt. Like for like, equal for equal, hand to hand. If you are trading different kinds of good, then sell however you like, so long as it is hand to hand.”
(Narrated by Muslim, 1587 from the hadeeth of ‘Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit, may Allaah be pleased with him). 
The currency that exists nowadays is sui generis, and it comes under the same rulings as gold and silver. If you buy gold or silver with it, the transaction must take place immediately, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:  “If you are trading different kinds of good, then sell however you like, so long as it is hand to hand.”

22392,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22392,Depositing money in a riba-based bank,"Is it allowed for me to keep the money in the Bank for transactions only, if i will not take any Interest on the deposited money. But obviously bank will use this interest for themselves",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to put money in a bank that deals in riba (usury or interest), and the Muslim should not do that unless he is forced to, in which case the following three conditions apply: 
1 – He should have the need to do that, meaning that there is no safe place to keep his money except this bank. If he can find another place where he can keep his money apart from this riba-based bank, then it is not permissible for him to deposit his money in this bank which deals with riba. 
2 – The bank should not deal one hundred percent with riba; if the bank’s dealings are one hundred percent with riba then it is not permissible to deposit his money with them at all, if you deposit money in the bank then in this case you can be certain that you have helped the bank engage in riba, and it is not permissible to help anyone with riba. 
3 – The depositor should not take any profit, because if he takes any profit that will be riba, and riba is haram according to the Qur’an and Sunnah and the consensus of the Muslims. 
With regard to the questioner’s saying that if he does not take the interest the bank will take it: 
This is not interest, rather it is riba which is haram, and it belongs to the bank in the first place. The depositor does not have the right to take anything of it, because Allah has commanded us to abstain from riba when He said (interpretation of the meaning):
 “O you who believe! Be afraid of Allah and give up what remains (due to you) from Ribaa (from now onward) if you are (really) believers”
[al-Baqarah 2:278]
And He warned against taking riba when He said:
“And if you do not do it, then take a notice of war from Allah and His Messenger”
[al-Baqarah 2:278-279]
 It should also be noted that depositing this money in the banks is not regarded as depositing it in the shar’i sense, because depositing something in sharee’ah means leaving it with someone for safekeeping, which means that the owner cannot use it; but when money is deposited in the bank, the bank uses the money, so it is a form of lending, not depositing for safekeeping. The fuqaha’ have explained this point, that if the depositor gives the keeper permission to use his money, it is no longer a deposit for safekeeping, rather it is a loan. (Therefore anything added to the principle is riba).

22393,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22393,Reducing the eyebrows by cutting them,I have come across various Islamic articles & write-ups that have spoken against shaving of hair on eyebrows amongst other areas of the body. I however need clarification on this does this shaving refer to TOTAL shaving? Am I allowed to reduce the amount of hair by mere shaping ? I have very bushy eyebrows that need trimming as it makes my face look crowded.,,,"Praise be to Allah.We will quote for you the fatwas issued by the scholars concerning the ruling on removing hair from the eyebrows and hair from the rest of the body. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “If removing hair from the eyebrows is done by plucking, this is namas (plucking the eyebrows) and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed the naamisah (the woman who plucks eyebrows) and the mutanammisah (the woman who has her eyebrows plucked). This is a major sin, and women are singled out in this ruling because they are the ones who usually do this, for the purpose of beautification, but if a man were to do it he would also be cursed, just as a woman is cursed for doing this, Allah forbid. 
If hair is removed from the eyebrows by a method other than plucking, such as by cutting or shaving, some of the scholars regard this as being the same as plucking, because it is changing the creation of Allah, so there is no difference between plucking, cutting or shaving. This is undoubtedly more on the safe side, so a person must avoid that, whether man or woman.” 
(Quoted from Fataawa ‘Ulama’ al-Balad al-Haram, p. 577) 
 The following question was mentioned in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (5/196): 
A young woman has very thick eyebrows that make her look bad. This girl was forced to shave part of the area between the eyebrows and to reduce the rest so that she will look acceptable to her husband. 
The Committee replied: 
“It is not permissible to shave the eyebrows or reduce then, because that is the namas (plucking) for which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed the one who does it and the one who asks for it to be done. What you must do is repent and pray for forgiveness for what you have done in the past, and beware of that in the future. 
Another question (5/195) was put to the Committee: 
Namas means removing some of the hair of the eyebrows, and is not permitted, because the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed the woman who plucks her eyebrows and the one who has that done, but it is permissible for a woman to remove a beard or moustache, if one grows, or hair from her legs or arms.” 
The hadeeth which says that the woman who plucks the eyebrows or who has that done is cursed was narrated by al-Bukhaari (4886) and Muslim (2125), from the hadeeth of ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ood (may Allah be pleased with him). 
The point is that it is haram to remove any hair from the eyebrows, whether all the hair is removed by shaving, or some of it is removed by cutting. Anything apart from that is permissible, such as removing hair from the arms and legs, and the area between the eyebrows. The following appeared in Fataawa al-Lajnah (5/197): 
Question: What is the ruling on plucking the hair between the eyebrows? 
Answer: It is permissible to pluck it, because it is not part of the eyebrows.

22394,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22394,The soundness of the hadeeth “Do not write anything from me…” and explanation of what it means,"Is this hadeeth saheeh, and what does it mean: “Do not write anything from me, and whoever writes anything but the Qur’aan, let him erase it”? May Allaah reward you with good.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It was 
          narrated from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri that the Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Do not write anything 
          from me; whoever has written anything from me other than the Qur’aan, 
          let him erase it and narrate from me, for there is nothing wrong with 
          that.” (Narrated by Muslim, al-Zuhd wa’l-Raqaa’iq, 5326) 
Al-Nawawi 
          said in his commentary on Saheeh Muslim: 
“Al-Qaadi 
          said: there were many disputes among the Sahaabah and Taabi’een concerning 
          the writing down of knowledge. Many of them regarded this as being makrooh, 
          but most of them regarded it as permissible. This dispute is no longer 
          an issue. 
They differed 
          as to the meaning of this hadeeth which says that it is forbidden. It 
          was said that this pertained to one who was sure of his memory, and 
          there was the fear that he may rely upon what he had written if he wrote 
          it down; the ahaadeeth which say that it is permissible to write things 
          down is to be interpreted as referring to the one whose memory is not 
          reliable, such as the hadeeth, “Write it down for Abu Shaah”; or the 
          hadeeth of the saheefah of ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him); the 
          hadeeth of the book of ‘Amr ibn Hazm, which contains laws on inheritance, 
          sunnahs and diyaat (blood money); the hadeeth about writing down charity, 
          and the minimum amounts at which zakaah becomes obligatory (nisaab), 
          with which Abu Bakr sent Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) to Bahrain; 
          the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah which says that Ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas used 
          to ; write things down but he (Abu Hurayrah) did not write things down, 
          and other ahaadeeth. And it was said that the hadeeth forbidding writing 
          down ahaadeeth was abrogated by these ahaadeeth. The prohibition was 
          in effect when there was the fear that (the words of the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) might be mixed with the 
          Qur’aan. When that danger was no longer present, permission was given 
          to write down (ahaadeeth). And it was said that the prohibition mentioned 
          in the hadeeth referred to writing ahaadeeth on the same page as Qur’aan, 
          lest they become mixed and thus the reader would be confused when looking 
          at this page. And Allaah knows best. 
The hadeeth 
          of Abu Shaah was narrated by al-Bukhaari from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah 
          be pleased with him), who said: ‘When Allaah granted His Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) victory over Makkah, he 
          stood before the people and praised and glorified Allaah, then he said: 
          “Allaah protected Makkah from the elephant and has given authority to 
          His Messenger and the believers over it, so fighting was forbidden for 
          anyone before me, and was made permissible for me for part of a day, 
          and it will not be permissible for anyone after me. Its game should 
          not be chased, its thorny bushes should not be uprooted, and picking 
          up its fallen things is not allowed except for one who makes public 
          announcement for it, and he whose relative is murdered has the option 
          either to accept a compensation for it or to retaliate.” Al-‘Abbas said, 
          “Except Al-Idhkhir (a kind of plant), for we use it in our graves and 
          houses.” The Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Except Al-Idhkhir.” 
          Abu Shaah, a Yemeni, stood up and said, “O Messenger of Allaah! Get 
          it written for me.” The Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Write it for Abu 
          Shaah.”  (al-Luqatah, 2254) 
Ibn Hajar 
          said: What may be understood from the story of Abu Shaah (“Write it 
          for Abu Shaah”) is that the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) gave permission for hadeeth 
          to be written down from him. 
This contradicts 
          the hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri, which says that the Messenger of 
          Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, ‘Do not write down 
          anything from me except the Qur’aan.’ (Narrated by Muslim). 
The two 
          may be reconciled by noting that the prohibition applied only to the 
          time when the Qur’aan was being revealed, lest it be confused with something 
          else, and that permission was given at other times; or that the prohibition 
          applied only to writing down things other than Qur’aan with the Qur’aan 
          on one thing, and that permission was given to write them separately; 
          of that the prohibition came first and the permission abrogated that, 
          when there was no longer any fear of confusion. This is most likely 
          to be the case.                                
          
It was 
          said that the prohibition applied only to those whom it was feared would 
          depend on the writing and not memorize things, and that permission was 
          given for those from whom such a thing was not feared. 
The scholars 
          said: a group of the Sahaabah and Taabi’een regarded it as makrooh to 
          write down the hadeeth and they regarded it as mustahabb to learn it 
          from them by heart, as they had learned it. But when people were no 
          longer able to strive so hard (in memorizing) and the scholars feared 
          that knowledge might be lost, they compiled it in books.”",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

Rather he wants to increase his profits. There are some who swear by Allah that this is the price they paid. What is the ruling on that?",,,"Praise be to Allah.If a person buys a product and offers it for sale, and says, “It cost me such and such” but he is lying by saying that he paid more for it than he really did, then he is doing something that is haraam and is committing a sin. He risks losing the barakah (blessing) of his sale. If he swears by Allah to that effect, then his sin is even greater and the punishment will be more severe. He is included in the warning mentioned in the hadeeth narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh from Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him), in which it says that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There are three whom Allah will not look at on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them, and theirs will be a painful torment.” We said, “Who are they, O Messenger of Allah? For they have indeed failed and are losers.” He said, “The one who reminds others of his favours, the one who lets his lower garment hang below his ankles, and the one who sells his product by swearing false oaths.” (al-Tirmidhi said, this is a saheeh hasan hadeeth). According to another report, “by evil oaths.” And al-Bukhaari, Muslim and others narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: ‘Swearing an oath may sell a product but it destroys the barakah.” 
Al-Bukhaari narrated in his Saheeh (vol 4, p. 316) from ‘Abd-Allah ibn Abi Awfa (may Allah be pleased with him) that a man offered him an item for sale in the market and he swore falsely by Allah that someone else had already made him an offer in order to get a Muslim to buy it.  Then the aayah was revealed (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, those who purchase a small gain at the cost of Allah’s Covenant and their oaths, they shall have no portion in the Hereafter (Paradise). Neither will Allah speak to them nor look at them on the Day of Resurrection nor will He purify them, and they shall have a painful torment” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:77]
Al-Bukhaari and Muslim narrated in their Saheehs that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There are three whom Allah will not look at and will not purify, and theirs will be a painful torment: a man who has extra water but he withholds it from the wayfarer; a man who gives allegiance (bay’ah) to another man (according to one report, to a leader) but he only did so for the purpose of worldly gains, so if he gets what he wants he is loyal to him, otherwise he betrays him; and a man who bargains with another man concerning some product after the time of ‘Asr and he swears (falsely) to him that he has already been offered such and such, and he sells it.”

With regard to women working and going out of 
    the home, we say: 
1 – The basic principle is that women should stay in their houses. This is indicated by the 
    verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And stay in your houses, and do not 
    display yourselves like that of the times of ignorance”
[al-Ahzaab 33:33]
Although this was addressed to the wives of 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), all believing women should follow them in that. It was addressed to the wives of the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) because of their honoured status and because they are the example for the believing 
    women. 
This is also indicated by the words of the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Woman is ‘awrah, and when she goes out the Shaytaan gets his hopes up. She is never 
    closer to Allaah than when she is in the innermost part of her house.” (Narrated by Ibn Hibbaan and Ibn Khuzaymah; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani 
    in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, no. 2688. 
And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said concerning women praying in the mosques: “Their houses are better for them.” (Narrated by Abu Dawood, 567’ classed as 
    saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood). 
2 – It is permissible for a woman to work or 
    study so long as a number of conditions are met: 
-That this work is suited to the nature and aptitude of women, such as medicine, nursing, teaching, 
    tailoring and so on.
-The work should be in a place that is for women only, with no mixing between the sexes. It is not 
    permissible for a woman to study or work in a mixed school.
-The woman should wear proper Islamic hijaab at work.
-Her work should not lead to her travelling without a mahram.
-Her going out to work should not involve her committing any sin, such as being alone with the driver, 
    or wearing perfume where non-mahram men will be able to smell it.
-That should not lead to her neglecting her duties of looking after the house or taking care of her 
    husband and children.
3 – What you have mentioned about your being 
    able and willing to work, teach or study is something good. Perhaps that will help you to serve Allaah, such as teaching Muslim girls in your 
    house or in the Islamic center – subject to the conditions mentioned above – or doing something that will benefit you and your family, such as 
    sewing and the like, which will be a means of stopping boredom. 
You could also join one of the Islamic Open 
    Universities, which will let you enroll in a distance-learning program, so that you can increase your knowledge and understanding of Islam, as 
    well as attaining a higher status before Allaah. For the angels lower their wings for the seeker of knowledge, and the inhabitants of the heavens 
    and the earth pray for forgiveness for the scholar, even the fish in the sea, as it says in the hadeeth narrated by al-Tirmidhi (no. 2682), Abu 
    Dawood (3641), al-Nasaa’i (158) and Ibn Maajah (223); this hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
Ask Allaah to bless you with righteous offspring, because in raising these children a woman 
    will fill her time and will not feel bored, and she will be rewarded for all of that, praise be to Allaah. 
Remember that it is obligatory to obey your 
    husband unless he tells you to do something sinful. So if a husband tells his wife not to go out to work or to study, she has to obey him, and 
    this will lead to her happiness and salvation. According to a hadeeth narrated by Ibn Hibbaan in his Saheeh, “If a woman prays her five 
    daily prayers, fasts her month (of Ramadaan), guards her chastity and obeys her husband, it will be said to her: ‘Enter Paradise from whichever of 
    its gates you wish.’” (Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, no. 661). 
But the husband should not exploit this right 
    to hurt his wife’s feelings or ignore her opinion or go against her wishes. Rather he has to fear Allaah and try to consult with his wife and 
    discuss with her, and explain the shar’i ruling to her, and give her permissible alternatives that will make her happy, develop her potential and 
    achieve some of what she wants. 
We ask Allaah to help us all to do that which 
    He loves and which pleases Him.
