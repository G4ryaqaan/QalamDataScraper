33603,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/33603,Their father molested them – should they cut him off?,"My children's father has been jailed for child sexual abuse. Does he still inherit from them, should they die before him? Does he retain any of the rights of a father?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.This criminal father who has betrayed his 
    trust should be advised and called to Allaah, and reminded of the meeting with Him, and should be told how evil it is to do this action which 
    contradicts the idea of fatherhood. For the children are part of the man, so how can a man feel desire towards his own children?! Inna Lillaahi 
    wa inna ilayhi raaji’oon (“Truly, to Allaah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return” – said when faced with a calamity). 
If advice and reminders are of no use with 
    him, then he must be stopped and punished severely, to deter him and others like him from doing such abhorrent and repulsive acts. 
This great evil does not mean that he loses 
    his right to kind treatment and upholding the ties of kinship, so long as there is no danger of falling into any haraam actions. 
Allaah has enjoined kind treatment of parents 
    even if they try to make their child ascribe partners to Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“But if they (both) strive with you to 
    make you join in worship with Me others that of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not; but behave with them in the world kindly”
[Luqmaan 31:15]
So his children have to treat him kindly and honour him, but they must also be extremely 
    cautious in their dealings with their father. None of them should stay with him on his or her own. If one of his children dies, he has the right 
    of inheritance, like any other father and child.
 You should make a lot of du’aa’ for him, 
    praying that he may be guided and enabled to repent, for hearts are held between two of the fingers of the Most Merciful and He turns them however 
    He wills.

33610,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/33610,al-Bukhaari and Muslim,Please give the history of Imam Bukhari and Imam Muslim.,,,"Praise be to Allah.There follows a brief biography of these two 
    great imams. 
1 – Imam al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have 
    mercy on him)
He is the great imam, scholar, leader of the 
    believers in hadeeth, Abu ‘Abd-Allaah Muhammad ibn Ismaa’eel ibn Ibraaheem al-Bukhaari. He was born in Bukhaara in Shawwaal of 194 AH, and grew up 
    as orphan. He lost his sight as a child, then Allaah restored to him his sight. He memorized hadeeth as a child, and he was a prodigy in that, may 
    Allaah have mercy on him. 
The imams attested to his good memory, 
    precision, knowledge, asceticism and worship. Imam Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on him) said of him: Khorasan has never produced anyone like him. 
Ibn Khuzaymah (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    said: I have never seen anyone beneath the canopy of heaven who has more knowledge of the hadeeth of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) and who has memorized more (hadeeth) than al-Bukhaari. 
Al-Tirmidhi (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    said: I have never seen in Iraq or in Khorasan anyone with more knowledge of hadeeth criticism, history and isnaads than al-Bukhaari. 
Al-Bukhaari had more than one thousand 
    shaykhs whom he met in the countries and cities to which he travelled. Among them were: Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Hammaad ibn Shaakir, Makki ibn 
    Ibraaheem and Abu ‘Aasim al-Nabeel. 
Among those who narrated from al-Bukhaari 
    were: 
Muslim ibn al-Hajjaaj the author of 
    al-Saheeh; al-Tirmidhi; al-Nasaa’i; Muhammad ibn Nasr al-Marwazi; and many others. 
Al-Bukhari wrote many books, the most famous 
    of which are: al-Jaami’ al-Saheeh; al-Tareekh al-Kabeer; al-Adab al-Mufrad; Khalq Af’aal al-‘Ibaad. 
He died, may Allaah have mercy on him, on the 
    night of Eid al-Fitr, 256 AH. 
2 – Imam Muslim (may Allaah have mercy on 
    him)
He is the great imam, hafiz and scholar, 
    Abu’l-Husayn, Muslim ibn al-Hajjaaj ibn Muslim al-Nisaboori. He was born in 204 AH, or it was said in 206 AH. 
He devoted his time to hadeeth, and he 
    travelled in search of hadeeth and strove hard in that field, until he became very prominent. His contemporaries attested to his virtues. His 
    shaykh Muhammad ibn Bashshaar (Bandaar) said: The haafiz of this world are four: Abu Zar’ah in al-Ray, Muslim in Nisapur, ‘Abd-Allaah al-Daarimi 
    in Samarqand, and Muhammad ibn Ismaa’eel in Bukhaara. 
Ahmad ibn Salamah al-Nisaboori said: I saw 
    Abu Zar’ah and Abu Haatim giving precedence to Muslim ibn al-Hajjaaj in knowledge of saheeh over the shaykhs of their time.  
Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said of him: They were 
    unanimously agreed on his eminence, leadership and high status. The greatest evidence of that is his book al-Saheeh; no book before it or 
    after is as well organized or precise in the isnaads of its hadeeth. 
His shaykhs included: Ahmad ibn Hanbal, al-Bukhaari, Yahya ibn Yahya al-Teemi, Ishaaq ibn 
    Raahawayh, Yahya ibn Ma’een, Abu Bakr ibn Abi Shaybah and many others. 
His students included: Abu Haatim al-Raazi, 
    Abu ‘Eesa al-Tirmidhi, Ibn Khuzaymah, Abu ‘Awaanah al-Isfaraayeeni and Makki ibn ‘Abdaan. 
His well known books include: al-Jaami’ 
    al-Saheeh; al-Kuna wa’l-Asma’; al-Tabaqaat; al-Tamyeez; and al-Munfaridaat wa’l-Wahdaan. 
He died, may Allaah have mercy on him, in 
    Rajab 261 AH.

The one who is appointed to do that on his behalf is not obliged to adhere to that. 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz said: 
Those who are appointed to do this on behalf of others are not the ones who are offering the sacrifice, rather the ones who are offering the sacrifice are the one who appointed them to do that.

2- what consequences this might bring to the father if the child is born in a christian environment and the father does not even admits it is his own child. ultrasound has shown the resemblance to the father. the father is calling her a liar and that she is faking it eventhough it is confirmed true. the father went ahead and got engaged recently and discontinued the 20 yr relationship with me over this subject. 

3- any advice to the father in this instance

your answer is very appreciated.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The basic principle is that the child should 
    be called after his father, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The child is for the bed and the adulterer 
    gets nothing.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2053; Muslim, 1457. What this hadeeth means is that the child should be named after the woman’s husband 
    and the adulterer is to be condemned and gets nothing. (al-Fath, 12/36). This being named after the father is the child’s right and it is 
    not permissible to transgress this right. 
But if the husband is certain or thinks it 
    most likely that the child is not his, then he may deny it, by means of the process of li’aan. 
According to the majority of scholars of the 
    four madhhabs, the child does not lose the right to be named after his father simply because the father rejects him, even if the wife admits that 
    she committed adultery. Rather it is essential to carry out the li’aan process. 
Li’aan is done as described in the verse in 
    which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And for those who accuse their wives, but 
    have no witnesses except themselves, let the testimony of one of them be four testimonies (i.e. testifies four times) by Allaah that he is one of 
    those who speak the truth.
And the fifth (testimony should be) the 
    invoking of the Curse of Allaah on him if he be of those who tell a lie (against her).
But it shall avert the punishment (of 
    stoning to death) from her, if she bears witness four times by Allaah, that he (her husband) is telling a lie.
And the fifth (testimony) should be that 
    the Wrath of Allaah be upon her if he (her husband) speaks the truth”
[al-Noor 24:6-9]
So the husband should say four times, “I bear 
    witness by Allaah that I am telling the truth in my accusation of her committing adultery” or “I bear witness by Allaah that you have committed 
    adultery and this is not my child.” And the fifth time he adds: “May the curse of Allaah be upon me if I am telling a lie.” 
And the woman – if she denies it – should 
    say: “I bear witness by Allaah that he is lying, and that this child is his child.” And the fifth time she should pray that the wrath of Allaah 
    should be upon her if he is telling the truth. 
The li’aan should be done in the mosque in 
    the presence of a number of Muslims, along with the judge or his deputy, or whoever they agree to appoint from among the Muslims.  
Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said: “Similarly the 
    scholars did not disagree that li’aan can only be done in the mosque in which Jumu’ah prayers are held.” Fath al-Barr, 10/525. 
When two spouses engage in li’aan, a number 
    of things happen as a result: 
1 – The husband is not subject to the hadd 
    punishment for slander 
2 – The wife is not subject to the hadd 
    punishment for adultery. 
3 – Husband and wife are divorced 
    automatically, and this divorce is not dependent upon a judge’s ruling; rather divorce takes place as soon as the process of li’aan is completed, 
    according to many scholars. 
4 – They are forever forbidden to remarry. 
5 – The child is not to be named after his 
    father, rather he should be named after his mother. He and the husband cannot inherit from one another, and the husband is not obliged to spend on 
    him because he is a stranger to him. 
Undoubtedly abandoning a child in a Christian 
    environment which will have an influence on him is a serious matter. Hence the husband should not engage in li’aan and disown the child unless he 
    has proof and is certain that his wife has committed adultery. 
Otherwise is it a serious sin and injustice 
    towards his child, and exposing him to kufr and deviation.

The correct view is that this does not invalidate your prayer, because doubts often come to a man without him wanting them to. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained the ruling concerning doubts in prayer, and that doubts fall into two categories: 
1 – When the person doubts the number of rak’ahs he has prayed, but he thinks one of the two is more likely. In this case he should act upon what he is more certain of, and complete the prayer on that basis, then say the salam and do the prostration of forgetfulness (sajdat al-sahw) after the salam. 
2 – When he doubts the number of rak’ahs, and neither number seems more likely to him. In this case he should act upon the lower number, because that is more certain and the higher number is doubtful, and he should complete the prayer based on the lower number, then do two prostrations for forgetfulness before the salam.

Is this condition permissible according to sharee’ah?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.If a product is sold subject to the condition 
    that it cannot be returned or exchanged, that is not permissible, because it is an invalid condition which may lead to harm or confusion, and 
    because the intention of the vendor in stipulating this condition is to oblige the purchaser to keep the product even if it is faulty. This 
    condition does not exonerate him if faults are found in the product because if it is faulty then he should exchange the faulty product or the 
    purchaser should be given a reduction, because the full price is given in exchange for a sound product, and if the vendor takes the full price 
    when the product is faulty, he has taken it unlawfully. 
According to sharee’ah, customary conditions 
    are as valid as verbal conditions. Customarily it is assumed that the product will be free of faults, so the purchaser is justified in returning 
    it if it is faulty.

Can women go to Jumu`ah during mensus to listen to the khutbah?","Praise be to Allah.Can a woman enter the mosque during menses?
If you want to sit in the mosque to listen to the khutbah, this is not permitted, because it is not permitted for a menstruating woman to enter the mosque, unless she is only passing through. 
But if she is going to sit in a place that is attached to the mosque or close to it , then there is nothing wrong with that, because she is not entering the mosque in this case. 
Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
It is prohibited for a menstruating woman to stay in the mosque; it is even prohibited for her to stay in the Eid prayer place, because of the Hadith of Umm `Atiyah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: “He (meaning the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)) commanded us to bring out on the two Eids the adolescent girls and the virgins in seclusion, but he commanded the menstruating women to stay away from the prayer-place of the Muslims.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 324 and Muslim, 890. Risalat Ad-Dima’ At-Tabi`iyyah li’l-Nisa’, p. 52-5)  
The Standing Committee (5/398) was asked about the ruling on menstruating women entering the mosque. 
They replied:  
“It is not permissible for a menstruating woman to enter the mosque except to pass through it if she needs to . This is like the one who is in a state of impurity following sexual activity, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Approach not the prayer when you are in a drunken state until you know (the meaning) of what you utter, nor when you are in a state of Janaba (i.e. in a state of sexual impurity and have not yet taken a bath), except when travelling on the road (without enough water, or just passing through a mosque), till you wash your whole body.” [An-Nisa’ 4:43]
Can women go to Jumu`ah during mensus to listen to the khutbah?
The Standing Committee was also asked (6/272) about the Islamic ruling on a woman who enters the mosque when she is menstruating so that she can listen to the khutbah . 
They replied: 
“It is not permissible for a woman to enter the mosque when she is menstruating or bleeding following childbirth… But simply passing through is allowed, if she needs to and she is certain that she will not make the mosque impure, i.e. by drops of blood falling on the floor, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“…nor when you are in a state of Janaba (i.e. in a state of sexual impurity and have not yet taken a bath), except when travelling on the road (without enough water, or just passing through a mosque)…” [An-Nisa’ 4:43]
A menstruating woman comes under the same rulings as one who is Junub, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded Aishah to pass him something from the mosque when she was menstruating.

My question is: how can I save myself from this temptation, when I see it everywhere – in the street, on TV, on the internet, at work…?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Allaah has created man in a world of trials and tests, and He has made Paradise the abode of His friends and beloved ones, who preferred His pleasure over their own and preferred obedience to Him over their physical comfort. And He has made Hell the abode of those among His slaves who disobey Him and preferred their own whims and desires to the pleasure of their Lord. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Such is the Paradise which We shall give as an inheritance to those of Our slaves who have been Al-Muttaqoon (the pious)”
[Maryam 19:63]
“But as for him who feared standing before his Lord, and restrained himself from impure evil desires and lusts.
Verily, Paradise will be his abode”
[al-Naaz’i’aat 79:40-41]
And He says concerning the people of Hell (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Then, there has succeeded them a posterity who have given up As-Salaat (the prayers) [i.e. made their Salaat (prayers) to be lost, either by not offering them or by not offering them perfectly or by not offering them in their proper fixed times] and have followed lusts. So they will be thrown in Hell”
[Maryam 19:59]
 And He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“That shall be their recompense, Hell; because they disbelieved and took My Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) and My Messengers by way of jest and mockery”
[al-Kahf 18:106] 
“Then for him who transgressed all bounds, (in disbelief, oppression and evil deeds of disobedience to Allaah).
And preferred the life of this world (by following his evil desires and lusts),
Verily, his abode will be Hell-fire”
[al-Naazi’aat 79:37-39]
So the Muslim must strive to worship Allaah and keep away from that which angers Allaah, for Allaah will not cause the reward the one who does good to be lost: 
“As for those who strive hard in Us (Our Cause), We will surely guide them to Our paths (i.e. Allaah’s religion — Islamic Monotheism). And verily, Allaah is with the Muhsinoon (good-doers)”
[al-‘Ankaboot 29:69 – interpretation of the meaning]
One of the fitnahs (temptations) with which we are tested is the fitnah of women, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “I have not left behind me any fitnah (temptation) more harmful to men than women.” There follow some of the methods by which we can avoid this temptation. We ask Allaah to set the affairs of the Muslims straight. 
1 – Faith in Allaah.
Faith in Allaah and fear of Allaah provide a safety valve and protect a person against committing haraam actions and following his own whims and desires. 
If the believer becomes aware that Allaah is always watching and if he ponders the meanings of His names and attributes, such as the All-Knowing, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing, the Watchful, the Reckoner, the Preserver, the All-Encompassing, that will generate fear of Him in secret and in public, and will put a stop to disobedience towards Allaah, and will reduce the strength of desire that leads many people to commit haraam actions.  
2 – Lowering the gaze and avoiding looking at haraam things
The gaze can generate bad thoughts in the heart, which then lead to ideas and then to desires, then to will and resolve, and then inevitably to doing haraam things. Think about the meaning of this verse which makes a connection between the first steps towards haraam and the end result. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts). That is purer for them. Verily, Allaah is All-Aware of what they do”
[al-Noor 24:30]
Ibn Katheer said: “This is a command from Allaah to His believing slaves, to lower their gaze and avoid looking at that which is forbidden to them so that they only look at that which they are permitted to look at.  If it so happens that a person’s gaze accidentally falls upon something haraam, he should turn his gaze away from it quickly. 
3 – Warding off evil thoughts
Bad thoughts pose a danger to the heart… If a person dwells on them and does not push them away, they will develop into an idea, then into will and resolve, then this will inevitably lead to haraam actions.  Beware of dwelling on passing thoughts; rather what you must do is to ward them off and crowd them out with good thoughts. 
The treatment, then, is to ward off these passing thoughts and keep yourself busy with beneficial thoughts. 
4 – Marriage
It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “O young men, whoever among you can afford it, let him get married, and whoever cannot, let him fast, for it will be a shield for him.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5065. 
5 – Fasting for those who cannot afford to get married
– because of the hadeeth quoted above, in which it says, “…and whoever cannot, let him fast, for it will be a shield for him.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5065. 
Al-Qurtubi said: 
The less a person eats, the weaker his desire becomes, and the weaker his desire is, the less sins he commits. 
6 – Keeping away from bad companions.
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “A man will follow the way of his close friends, so let each one of you look at who he takes as a close friend.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 8433; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 4046. 
7 – Keeping away from places of temptation.
It is obvious that we are living in a society that is filled with temptation – media of all types, magazines, flirting in the marketplaces, satellite TV, the internet, etc… So you have to flee from all of these in order to keep your religious commitment sound. 
8 – Do not make your houses graves.
Make your house a reminder of obedience, not of sin. If a room is connected to sin for example, that will make a person commit sin repeatedly, because every time he enters that room he will remember the sin and may be provoked to commit the sin again. So he should make his room and his house a reminder of obedience to Allaah, so when he enters he sees the Mus-haf which he reads, and he remembers praying qiyaam al-layl for Allaah, and the regular Sunnah prayers that he offers in this room. Doing a lot of acts of worship in your house will make a connection in your mind between the house and doing good deeds, so you will do more and will think less of sin, and the calls of desire will grow less. 
9 – Trying to make the most of your time in worshipping and obeying Allaah. 
Time is one of the great blessings that Allaah has bestowed upon His slaves, but there are many who are not making the most of it. It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Two blessings which many people do not make the most of: good health and spare time.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6412. 
See also question no. 3234. 
10 – Remembering the blessings of the Hereafter. 
Particularly appropriate in this context is remembering al-hoor al-‘iyn and their attributes, whom Allaah has prepared for those who are patient and steadfast in avoiding sin. This can help the Muslim to look away from these transient haraam pleasures which only lead to regret and loss.

33656,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/33656,Muslim man marrying a chaste Christian woman,"I would be most grateful for your help with the following issue.
My daughter is a Christian (Woman of the Book) and she would like to marry a Muslim man and she does not want to change her religion.
They are both living in Singapore and I have been told that in Singapore because the Muslim relogion is not the dominant religion he cannot marry her unless she becomes a Muslim. Is this the case? If it is not, can they both be married in a Muslim wedding service even if my daughter remains a Christian and could the Muslim man also take part in a Christian wedding service after he has been married according to the Muslim tradition. 
I am sorry to submit such a long question but this issue is causing considerable difficulties in our family and I would like to have the correct Muslim law on this issue so I can resolve the problem with the least upset to all. I thank you in anticipation.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Islam does not prevent marriage to a Christian woman if she is chaste. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“…The food (slaughtered cattle, eatable animals) of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) is lawful to you and yours is lawful to them. (Lawful to you in marriage) are chaste women from the believers and chaste women from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before your time when you have given their due Mahr (bridal-money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage), desiring chastity (i.e. taking them in legal wedlock) not committing illegal sexual intercourse, nor taking them as girlfriends…” [Al-Maa’idah 5:5]
What is meant by chaste women is that they are free (not slaves) and chaste (not loose or immoral). 
See also question no. 2527 
But if a woman is not chaste, and she has boyfriends or lovers with whom she is intimate, then Islam forbids marriage to her, whether she is a Muslim or a woman from among the People of the Book, just as it forbids marriage to a man who has girlfriends or lovers, to protect married life from collapse and to protect against mixing of lineages and to avoid causes of dispute, accusation and suspicion. 
With regard to the Muslim husband attending marriage parties according to the Christian tradition, this is not permissible because there will be many things in these celebrations that are forbidden in Islam, such as free mixing between men and women, listening to music, drinking alcohol, dancing etc.

What was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is that which was narrated by Ibn Majah (3803) from ‘Aishah who said: “When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw something that he liked, he would say, ‘Al-hamdu Lillah alladhi bi ni’matihi tatimm ul-salihat (Praise be to Allah by Whose blessing good things happen).’ And if he saw something that he disliked he would say, ‘alhamdulillah ‘ala kulli hal’ (praise be to Allah in all circumstances).’” (Classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah) 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Tafsir Juz ‘Amma (p. 127): 
“With regard to what some people say, “Praise be to Allah besides Whom no one can be praised for that which is disliked”, this is contrary to that which is taught in the Sunnah. Rather you should say what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Al-hamdu Lillahi 'ala kulli haal (praise be to Allah in all circumstances).” If you say, “Praise be to Allah besides Whom no one can be praised for that which is disliked”, then you are in fact announcing that you dislike what Allah has decreed for you, and this is not appropriate. Rather what you should do is to bear with patience that which Allah has decreed for you, whether you like it or not, because the One Who has decreed it is Allah, may He be glorified. He is your Lord and you are His slave; He is your Owner and you belong to Him. If Allah is the One Who has decreed for you something that you dislike, then do not panic, rather you must be patient and not get angry, whether you keep that in your heart or you express it in your words and physical actions. 
Be patient and put up with it, because circumstances change and nothing in this world lasts forever.

Allah is to be praised in all circumstances, at times of both ease and hardship, because if He decrees a time of ease, it is a test and a trial. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and We shall make a trial of you with evil and with good.” [al-Anbiya 21:35]
If something bad happens to you, then bear it with patience, for that is also a test and a trial from Allah, to see whether you will be patient or not. If you are patient and seek reward from Allah, then Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Only those who are patient shall receive their reward in full, without reckoning.” [al-Zumar 39:10]”

The version narrated by Muslim (1574) says: “Whoever keeps a dog, except a dog for hunting or herding livestock, his reward will be decreased by two qeeraats every day.” 
Dogs used for farming or herding livestock are those that are used to guard them. 
This hadith indicates that it is permissible to keep a dog to guard one’s property. 
Al-‘Iraaqi said in Tarh al-Tathreeb, 6/28: Our companions and others said: it is permissible to keep a dog for these three purposes, namely hunting and protecting one’s livestock and farmland. They differed concerning keeping a dog for the fourth purpose, which is to guard houses or roads etc. Some of our companions said that it is not permissible because of this hadith and others, which clearly state that it is haram except for one of these three things. But most of them said, which is the more correct view, that it is permissible by way of analogy, based on the reason that may be understood from this hadith, which is necessity.”

I am asking because I am sad about the situation of the Muslims in those countries.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
The disasters and calamities that are 
    befalling the Muslims are only happening because they have forsaken the laws of Allaah regarding themselves, their societies and their nations. 
    They do not support (the cause of) Allaah so how will He support them? 
When some of the Muslims disobeyed the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in the Battle of Uhud, Allaah punished them with defeat, even though the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the senior Sahaabah were among them. So what about the Muslims nowadays when they are disobeying 
    Allaah night and day and transgressing His sacred limits, except for those on whom Allaah has mercy? 
Secondly: 
Although the Muslims are living through 
    disasters and calamities, and are suffering a great deal, what the west is facing in its societies and in their personal situations is even worse, 
    with regard to faith, security and the family, especially in matters pertaining to women. 
If you look at recent statistics from western 
    countries, you will see that they are more deserving of pity because of their situation. We will look at a few examples: 
65% of female workers are faced with sexual 
    harassment in the work place in some European countries. 
18% of women in America have been raped or 
    have been faced with attempted rape at some stage in their lives.

Half of Canadian woman have been exposed to 
    an incident of physical or sexual violence after the age of 16. 
45% were attacked by men who were known to 
    them. 
23% of them were attacked by strangers.

33680,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/33680,Muslim society and the care of the elderly,How are the elderly treated in Islam? Do they have a special status? Do they receive care that suits their health needs?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Islam is the religion of compassion and 
    justice, a religion that teaches perfect morals and forbids bad conduct, a religion that grants man his dignity, if he adheres to the laws of 
    Allaah. 
There can be no doubt that Islam has given 
    the elderly a special status, as there are texts which urge Muslims to respect and honour them. 
Care of the elderly in Islam is based on a 
    number of focal points, including the following: 
1 – Man is an honoured creature and has an 
    honourable status in Islam.
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And indeed We have honoured the Children 
    of Adam, and We have carried them on land and sea, and have provided them with At-Tayyibaat (lawful good things), and have preferred them above 
    many of those whom We have created with a marked preferment”
[al-Isra’ 17:70]
So the elderly, as sons of Adam, are included 
    in this high status, based on the general meaning of this verse. 
2 – Muslim society is the society of 
    mutual compassion and coherence
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah. And 
    those who are with him are severe against disbelievers, and merciful among themselves”
[al-Fath 48:29] 
And Allaah says, describing the believers 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Then he became one of those who believed 
    (in the Islamic Monotheism) and recommended one another to perseverance and patience, and (also) recommended one another to pity and compassion.
    
They are those on the Right Hand (i.e. the 
    dwellers of Paradise)”
[al-Balad 90:17-18]
The Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) described the believers as being like a single body. He  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The likeness 
    of the believers in their mutual love, mercy and compassion is that of the body; if one part of it complains, the rest of the body joins it in 
    staying awake and suffering fever.” Narrated by Muslim, 2586. 
And he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “None of you truly believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 13. 
And he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “The Most Merciful has mercy on those who are merciful. Be merciful to those who are on earth so that the One Who is in heaven 
    will have mercy on you.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (1924); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 1569. 
And he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “The relationship of the believer to the people of faith is like that of the head to the body; the believer is pained by the 
    suffering of the people of faith just as the body is pained by the suffering of the head.” Narrated by Ahmad, 32370); narrated by al-Albaani in 
    al-Saheehah, 1137. 
And he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “Man is doomed and a loser if Allaah does not put compassion for mankind in his heart.” Al-Albaani said in al-Silsilah 
    al-Saheehah (456): its isnaad is hasan. 
3 – The Muslim society is a society of 
    cooperation and mutual support
Ibn Abi’l-Dunya narrated from Ibn ‘Umar that 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The most beloved of people to Allaah is the one who brings most benefit to 
    people, and the most beloved of deeds to Allaah is making a Muslim happy, or relieving him of hardship, or paying off his debt, or warding off 
    hunger from him. For me to go with my Muslim brother to meet his need is dearer to me than observing i’tikaaf in this mosque – meaning the mosque 
    of Madeenah – for a month… whoever goes with his Muslim brother to meet his need, Allaah will make him stand firm on the Day when all feet will 
    slip.” Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Targheeb wa’l-Tarheeb, 2623. 
The Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever relieves a Muslim of one of the hardships of this world, Allaah will relieve him of one of the hardships of the 
    Day of Resurrection, and whoever helps one who is financial difficulty, Allaah will help in this world and in the Hereafter, and whoever conceals 
    a Muslim’s (fault), Allaah will conceal his (fault) in this world and in the Hereafter. Allaah will help a person so long as he helps his 
    brother.” Narrated by Muslim, 2699. 
4 – The elderly person has a high status before Allaah if he adheres to the laws of Allaah. 
The Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “No one of you should wish for death or pray for it before it comes to him, for when one of you dies, his good deeds 
    come to an end, and nothing increases a believer’s lifespan but good.” Narrated by Muslim, 2682. 
And he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “Shall I not tell you who is the best of you? The best of you is the one who lives the longest life, if he is righteous and does 
    good deeds.” al-Albaani said in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah (2498): it is hasan li ghayrihi. 
And he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “The best of you are those who live the longest and do the best deeds.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 
    3263. 
And he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “No one is better before Allaah than a believer who lives a long life in Islam because of his saying Subhaan-Allaah (tasbeeh), 
    Allaahu akbar (takbeer) and Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah (tahleel).” Narrated by Ahmad, 1404. al-Albaani said in al-Silsilah 
    al-Saheehah (654): its isnaad is hasan. 
Al-Tirmidhi narrated (2329) that a Bedouin 
    said: “O Messenger of Allaah, who is the best of people?” He said, “The one who lives a long life and does good deeds.” Classed as saheeh by 
    al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 1899. 
5 – Respecting the elderly and honouring them are characteristics of the Muslim society 
The Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “Part of glorifying Allaah is honouring the grey-haired Muslim.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 4843; classed as hasan by 
    al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 4053. 
An old man came wanting to see the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the people did not make way for him. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said: “He is not one of us who does not show mercy to our young ones and respect our old ones.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1919; classed as 
    hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 1565. 
6 – Ways in which the Muslim society takes 
    care of the elderly

    (i)
    Enjoining good treatment of parents:
This is one of the ways in which the elderly 
    are cared for in Islam, because parents are usually elderly. The command to honour one’s parents is accompanied with the command to believe in 
    Allaah alone (Tawheed) and the prohibition on associating others with Him (shirk) in many verses, for example Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 
“Worship Allaah and join none with Him (in 
    worship); and do good to parents…”
[al-Nisa’ 4:36] 
“And your Lord has decreed that you 
    worship none but Him. And that you be dutiful to your parents”
[al-Isra’ 17:23]
It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood 
    said: I asked the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “Which deed is most beloved to Allaah?” He said, “Prayer offered on 
    time.” He said, “Then what?” He said, “Then honouring one’s parents.” He said, “Then what?” He said, “Jihad for the sake of Allaah.” He told me 
    that if I wanted to ask him more, he would tell me more.
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 527. 

    (ii)
    Enjoining honouring one’s parents’ friends even after the parents have passed away, and regarding that as part of honouring one’s 
    parents.
The Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said:  “Part of honouring (one’s parents) is to keep in touch with your father’s friend.” Al-Albaani said in al-Silsilah 
    al-Saheehah (23030): it is saheeh when all its isnaads are taken into consideration. 
Muslim (2552) narrated from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn 
    ‘Umar that a man from among the Bedouin met him on the road to Makkah. ‘Abd-Allaah greeted him with salaam, made him ride on the donkey that he 
    was riding and gave him the turban that he had been wearing on his head. Ibn Dinar said: We said to him, May Allaah guide you, they are just 
    Bedouin and they are content with something simple. ‘Abd-Allaah said: The father of this man was a close friend of ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab and I 
    heard the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say, “The best way of honouring one’s parents is for the son to 
    keep in touch with his father’s friends.” 
Some of the salaf even used to travel in 
    order to keep in touch with their father’s friends. Ahmad (26998) narrated that Yoosuf ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Salaam said: I came to Abu’l-Darda’ 
    when he was sick with the illness that would be his last, and he said to me, “O son of my brother, what has brought you to this land?” or “what 
    has brought you?” He said: I said, “Nothing except to maintain the tie (of friendship) that existed between you and my father ‘Abd-Allaah ibn 
    Salaam.” 
This is one of the forms of elder care in 
    Islam. When the members of the Muslim society visit the friends of their fathers they help to include the elderly in society and put an end to the 
    isolation they feel, which in turn reduces impact of the social and psychological changes that the elderly go through. 
This is unlike what happens in non-Muslim 
    societies. From time to time we hear news of what happens to some of the elderly there, and the extent of the isolation in which they are living. 
There was an old man who was left dead in his 
    apartment for four years, and his body was only discovered by accident. Al-Jazeerah newspaper, issue no. 7751, 7/1414 AH. 
In a report from the Ministry of Families, Youth and Seniors in Germany in 1993 CE, it says 
    that there are 440,000 elderly people who are subjected to physical and mental abuse at the hands of their relatives and family members at least 
    once each year. 
There was an old paralyzed woman who died of 
    starvation in her apartment because her son had cut off her water, electricity and gas, until the neighbours found out what was happening… but 
    after it was too late. 
And an elderly man died in his flat in 
    London; he had five children but not one of them knew of his death until six months later. 
There was an old woman in Germany whose house 
    had a garden which was very beautiful. She took care of it all year round for the sake of only one day each year when her children came to visit 
    her, because she loved them so much but they ignored her. She prepared the garden for them one day and made delicious food for them, then she was 
    shocked when they made excuses and did not come. She wept a great deal and nearly cried herself to death. 
In one of the upper-class areas of Tokyo an 
    elderly man was discovered in his apartment one and a half years after he died. And an old lady was found who had died of starvation in her 
    apartment. 
Even stranger than that is the elderly man 
    who was over ninety years old, and no one knew that he had died for five days after his death. What is so strange is that he died in a seniors’ 
    home in the city of Sabor on the island of Hokkaido, and none of the workers in the home realized that he had died until some of his relatives 
    came to visit him and they found out what had happened.

33683,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/33683,Blood-money and expiation must be paid if one kills a kaafir who is protected by sharee’ah,"I work in a Muslim country, and I struck one of the kaafirs who came to work here with my car, and he died. I did not do that deliberately. Do I have to offer kafaarah (expiation) or not?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Yes, you have to offer expiation, and also 
    pay the diyah (blood money) which must be given to his family. The evidence for that is the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 
“It is not for a believer to kill a 
    believer except (that it be) by mistake; and whosoever kills a believer by mistake, (it is ordained that) he must set free a believing slave and a 
    compensation (blood money, i.e. Diya) be given to the deceased’s family unless they remit it. If the deceased belonged to a people at war with you 
    and he was a believer, the freeing of a believing slave (is prescribed); and if he belonged to a people with 
    whom you have a treaty of mutual alliance, compensation (blood money — Diya) must be paid to his family, and a believing slave must be 
    freed. And whoso finds this (the penance of freeing a slave) beyond his means, he must fast for two consecutive months in order to seek repentance 
    from Allaah. And Allaah is Ever All-Knowing, All-Wise”
[al-Nisa’ 4:92]
 The majority of scholars are of the view 
    that expiation must be offered by one who kills a kaafir who is protected by sharee’ah. 
The kaafirs who are 
    protected by sharee’ah are of three types: 
1 – Al-dhimmi. 
    This is one with whom we have a contract or treaty of al-dhimmah (i.e., one who lives in a Muslim state) 
2 – Al-mu’aahad. 
    This is one with whose people we have a peace treaty. 
2 – Al-musta’man. 
    This is one who has entered the Muslim land and has been guaranteed safety, such as those who come to do business, to work, to visit relatives, 
    and so on. 
Whoever kills a kaafir 
    who is protected by sharee’ah has to do two things: 
1 – Diyah 
    (blood-money). He has to pay the diyah to the family of the deceased. This applies so long as his family are not muhaaribeen (i.e., belong 
    to a people who are at war with the Muslim state). If his family are muhaaribeen, then they do not deserve the diyah, because their wealth 
    and their blood are not sacred. Tafseer al-Sa’di, p. 277. 
2 – Kafaarah 
    (expiation). This is the view of the majority. 
Ibn Qudaamah said in
    al-Mughni, 12/224: 
(Expiation) must be 
    offered for killing a kaafir who is protected by sharee’ah, whether he was a dhimmi or musta’man. This is the view of the majority 
    of scholars. Al-Hasan and Maalik said that no expiation is to be offered, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and whosoever 
    kills a believer by mistake, (it is ordained that) he must set free a believing slave”
[al-Nisa’ 4:92]
So their understanding 
    was that no expiation is required for a non-believer. But we note that Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and if he belonged to a
    people with whom you have a treaty of mutual alliance, compensation (blood money — Diyha) must be paid 
    to his family, and a believing slave must be freed”
[al-Nisa’ 4:92]
A dhimmi comes under the same category as 
    those mentioned here, and this is what may be understood from this verse. 
And because he is a human being who was 
    killed wrongfully, so expiation must be offered for killing him, as in the case of a Muslim. 
End of quote. 
This view was favoured by a number of 
    mufassireen, such as al-Tabari (9/43); al-Qurtubi (5/325); Ibn Katheer (2/376). 
Ibn Jareer al-Tabari said (9/40-43): 
Then the commentators differed concerning the 
    description of the victim who belonged to a people with whom we have a treaty of mutual alliance – is he a believer or a kaafir? Some of them 
    said, he is a kaafir but his killer has to pay the diyah (blood money), because he and his people have a treaty, so the diyah must be paid to his 
    people because of the treaty between them and the believers; this is wealth that belongs to them and it is not permissible for the believers to 
    take any of their wealth unless they give it willingly… 
Then al-Tabari said: The better of the two 
    views on the meaning of this verse is the view of those who said: what is meant by that is the victim from among ahl al-‘ahd [those with whom the 
    Muslims have a treaty], because the verse is ambiguous, as it says, “and if he belonged to a 
    people with whom you have a treaty of mutual alliance”, and it 
    does not say, “and he is a believer,” as it says with regard to the case of one who was slain and was a believer and belonged to a people at war 
    with the Muslims… The fact that it does not describe this person as a believer, as it does in the case of the two types mentioned previously, 
    clearly indicates that what we are saying is correct. 
It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas said 
    concerning the phrase “and if he belonged to a people with whom 
    you have a treaty of mutual alliance”: If he was a kaafir who was under your protection and was killed, then his 
    killer has to pay the diyah to his family, and set free a believing slave, or fast for two consecutive months. 
This view was also favoured by Shaykh Ibn 
    ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) in his commentary on Soorat al-Nisa’, tape no. 27, side 2. 
And Allaah knows best.",Islam Q&A
33689,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/33689,Falseness of the reports narrated concerning how long this world will last,"I heard that some scholars said that the Day of Resurrection would happen before the year 1500 AH, and they quoted some ahaadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) as evidence. Is this view correct?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The view referred to in the question was suggested by 
    al-Suyooti (may Allah have mercy on him) in his book al-Haawi, 
    2/249-256, in which he said that this world would last for seven thousand 
    years and that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    was sent at the end of the sixth millennium. 

    The end of the sixth millennium means half way through it. 
    Based on that the lifespan of this ummah is more than one thousand years and 
    less than 1500 years. 

    He said: “The period cannot be fifteen hundred years at 
    all.” 

    I.e., the period must be less than fifteen hundred years. 

    Then he mentioned the ahaadeeth and reports which he quoted 
    as evidence to support that, some of which are Israa’eeliyyaat (reports from 
    Jewish sources) which cannot be taken as evidence, and some of the rest are 
    da’eef (weak), and the scholars ruled that they are lies and fabrications 
    (mawdoo’). 

    The evidence that this view is false includes the following: 

    1 – If this view were correct, then everyone would know when 
    the Hour is to begin. This goes against what is mentioned in the verses of 
    the Qur’aan and the ahaadeeth of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) which definitely state that the time of the Hour is 
    known to no one except Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “People ask you concerning the Hour, say: ‘The knowledge 
    of it is with Allaah only. What do you know? It may be that the Hour is 
    near!’”

    [al-Ahzaab 33:63]
Ibn Katheer said 
    (6/527): 

    Here Allaah tells His Messenger  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) that he has no knowledge of the Hour and that if people 
    ask him about that, he should refer the matter to Allaah (i.e., say that 
    only Allaah knows that). 

    Al-Shanqeeti said (6/604): 

    It is known that innama (translated here as “only”) conveys 
    the meaning of exclusivity, so what the verse means is that the Hour is 
    known only to Allaah alone. 

    And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “They ask you (O Muhammad) about the Hour — when will be 
    its appointed time?

    You have no knowledge to say anything about it. 

    To your Lord belongs (the knowledge of) the term thereof?

    You (O Muhammad) are only a warner for those who fear it”

    [al-Naazi’aat 79:42-45]

    Ibn Katheer (4/736) said: 

    i.e., knowledge of that is not given to you or to anyone else 
    in creation, rather the matter is to be referred to Allaah, for He is the 
    One Who knows exactly when it will happen. 

    Al-Sa’di said: Because knowledge of the Hour serves no 
    religious or worldly purpose of people, rather their interests lie in its 
    being hidden from them, the knowledge of that has been concealed from all of 
    creation and Allaah has kept that knowledge to Himself. He says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “To your Lord belongs (the knowledge of) the term 
    thereof?”

    [al-Naaz’iaat 79:44]
The ahaadeeth which 
    indicate that the time of the Hour is known only to Allaah include the 
    famous hadeeth of Jibreel in which it says that the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to Jibreel, when he asked him about 
    the Hour: “The one who is asked about it does not know more than the one who 
    is asking.” Narrated by Muslim, 8. 
2 – These reports which 
    al-Suyooti (may Allaah have mercy on him) quoted as evidence were classed as 
    da’eef (weak) by the scholars, and indeed they ruled that they were lies. 

    Ibn al-Qayyim said in al-Manaar al-Muneef (1/80), 
    where he mentions the ways in which a hadeeth may be known to be mawdoo’:  

    “(one of these ways is): if the hadeeth goes against the 
    clear meaning of the Qur’aan, such as the hadeeth which says that this world 
    will last for seven thousand years and that we are now in the seventh 
    millenium. This is one of the most obvious of lies. Because if it were 
    correct then everyone would know that there was only two hundred and 
    fifty-one years left until the Resurrection from our time [i.e., the time of 
    Ibn al-Qayyim]. But Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “They ask you about the Hour (Day of Resurrection): “When 
    will be its appointed time?” Say: “The knowledge thereof is with my Lord 
    (Alone). None can reveal its time but He. Heavy is its burden through the 
    heavens and the earth. It shall not come upon you except all of a sudden.” 
    They ask you as if you have a good knowledge of it. Say: “The knowledge 
    thereof is with Allaah (Alone)…”

    [al-A’raaf 7:187]

    Ibn Katheer said in al-Nihaayah fi’l-Fitan wa’l-Malaahim 
    (1/25): 
There is no (sound) 
    ahaadeeth in which the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) defined when the Hour would be, rather he mentioned some of its 
    portents and signs. 

    He also said (2/28): 

    With regard to the statements in the books of the 
    Israa’eeliyyeen and the People of the Book which suggest that this world 
    will last for a certain number of millennia, more than one of the scholars 
    have stated that these are mistaken, and it comes as no surprise that they 
    were mistaken. There is a hadeeth which says, “This world is one of the 
    weeks of the Hereafter” but its isnaad is not saheeh either. The same 
    applies to every hadeeth which states a specific time for the Day of 
    Resurrection – none of their isnaads can be proven. 

    Al-Sakhaawi said in al-Maqaasid al-Hasanah (p. 444): 
Everything that has been 
    narrated describing a specific time for the Day of Resurrection either has 
    no basis at all or its isnaad cannot be proven. 

    3 – What al-Suyooti himself said indicates that this view is 
    false. 

    He mentions that the Mahdi will appear after twelve hundred 
    years, but fourteen hundred years have passed and the Mahdi has not appeared 
    yet. 

    He says that people will remain for one hundred and twenty 
    years after the sun rises from the west, then the Hour will begin. This 
    means that the sun should have been rising from the west for more than 
    twenty years!  

    He says that the Dajjaal will appear after one hundred years, 
    and the Messiah ‘Eesa ibn Maryam will come down and kill him, and he will 
    remain after that for forty years, but here we are in the last century – 
    according to what he says, and the Dajjaal has not appeared and the Messiah 
    ‘Eesa ibn Maryam has not yet come down. 

    He says that several of the major signs such as the Dajjaal, 
    the descent of ‘Eesa and the rising of the sun from the west will happen 
    more than two hundred years before the Hour begins. 

    All of these things indicate that this view is false, and 
    that knowledge of the Hour should be referred to Allaah, and Allaah commands 
    us (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “People ask you concerning the Hour, say: ‘The knowledge 
    of it is with Allaah only. What do you know? It may be that the Hour is 
    near!’”

33694,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/33694,Status of Prayer in Islam,I hope that you can explain to us the status of prayer in Islam.,"The status of prayer in Islam is indicated by the following: 1- Prayer is the pillar of the religion, which cannot stand without it; 2- Prayer is second in status to the Shahadatayn; 3- Prayer occupies a special position because of the way in which it was enjoined; 4- Allah erases sins by means of prayer; 5- Prayer is the last part of religion to be lost, and if it is lost, the whole religion is lost; and 6- Prayer is the first thing for which a person will be brought to account on the Day of Resurrection.",,"Praise be to Allah.Prayer occupies a great status in Islam that is not shared by any other act of worship. This is indicated by the following: 

Prayer is the pillar of the religion , which cannot stand without it. 

According to a Hadith narrated by Mu’adh ibn Jabal (may Allah be pleased with him), the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Shall I not tell you of the head of the whole matter and its pillar and top?” I [Mu’adh] said, “Yes, O Messenger of Allah.” He said, “The head of the matter is Islam, its pillar is prayer and its top is Jihad.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 2616; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi, 2110) 

Prayer is second in status to the Shahadatayn (the Two Testimonies of Faith) as further proof of the soundness of a person’s belief and as visible evidence of the beliefs that reside in the heart.  

The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Islam is built on five [pillars]: the testimony that there is none worthy of worship but Allah and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger, establishing prayer, paying Zakah, performing pilgrimage to the House, and fasting Ramadan.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 8; Muslim, 16) 
Establishing prayer means performing prayer in full with all its words and actions, at the appointed times, as it says in the Quran (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, As-Salah (the prayer) is enjoined on the believers at fixed hours” [An-Nisa’ 4:103] i.e., at defined times. 

Prayer occupies a special position among other acts of worship because of the way in which it was enjoined. 

It was not brought down to earth by an angel, rather Allah wanted to bless His Messenger Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) by taking him up to heaven and addressing him directly concerning the obligation of prayer. This is something that is unique to prayer among all the rituals of Islam. 
Prayer was enjoined on the night of the Mi`raj [Prophet’s ascent to heaven], approximately three years before the Hijrah. 
Fifty prayers (per day) were enjoined at first, then the number was reduced to five, but the reward of fifty remains. This is indicative of Allah’s love of prayer and its great status. 

Allah erases sins by means of prayer.

Al-Bukhari (528) and Muslim (667) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said – and in the Hadith of Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) it is narrated that he heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say – “What do you think if there was a river by the door of any one of you and he bathed in it five times a day, would there be any trace of dirt left on him?” They said, “No trace of dirt would be left on him.” He said, “That is like the five daily prayers, by means of which Allah erases sin.”  

Prayer is the last part of religion to be lost, and if it is lost the whole religion is lost. 

It was narrated that Jabir ibn ‘Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Between a man and Shirk [associating others with Allah] and Kufr [disbelief] there stands his giving up prayer.” (Narrated by Muslim, 82) 
Hence the Muslim should be keen to perform the prayers on time, and not be lazy or take the matter lightly. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So woe unto those performers of Salah (prayers) (hypocrites), Those who delay their Salah (prayer from their stated fixed times)” [Al-Ma’un 107:4-5]
And Allah warns those who cause their prayers to be lost by saying (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Then, there has succeeded them a posterity who have given up As-Salah (the prayers) [i.e. made their Salah (prayers) to be lost, either by not offering them or by not offering them perfectly or by not offering them in their proper fixed times] and have followed lusts. So they will be thrown in Hell” [Maryam 19:59]

Prayer is the first thing for which a person will be brought to account on the Day of Resurrection.

It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “The first deed for which a person will be brought to account on the Day of Resurrection will be his prayer. If it is good then he will have prospered and succeeded, but if it is bad then he will be doomed and have lost. If anything is lacking from his obligatory prayers, the Lord will say, ‘Look and see whether My slave did any voluntary prayers, and make up the shortfall in his obligatory prayers from that.’ Then all his deeds will be dealt with likewise.” (Narrated by An-Nasa’i, 465; At-Tirmidhi, 413. Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Al-Jami`, 2573) 
We ask Allah to help us to remember Him, give thanks to Him and to worship Him properly.

Hence we think that she should say the

    not an excuse unless she had lost her mind  to such an extent that she did not understand what she was saying. 
The Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) stated that the Muslim may speak a word that may lead him to Hell and bring upon him the wrath of Allaah. It was narrated from 
    Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “A person may speak a word that pleases Allaah and not pay 
    any attention to it, but Allaah raises him many degrees in status thereby. And a person may speak a word that angers Allaah and not pay any 
    attention to it, and He may throw him into Hell because of it.” 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6113. 
According to the version narrated by Muslim: 
    “A person may speak a word, not realizing (how serious it is) and be thrown as far into Hell because of it as the east is from the west.” 
If you enter Islam again by uttering the 
    Shahaadatayn, and if you regret what you said, then there is the hope that the good deeds you have done will not be lost. 
It was narrated that Hakeem ibn Hizaam (may 
    Allaah be pleased with him) said: 
I said, “O Messenger of Allaah, there are 
    some things that I used to do as acts of worship during the Jaahiliyyah, such as giving charity, freeing slaves and upholding the ties of kinship. 
    Will I get any reward for that?” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “You entered Islam with the good that you had done 
    before.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1436; Muslim, 123.  
So you and all our Muslim brothers and 
    sisters have to take the matter of religion and belief seriously. Because a person’s religion and the soundness of his belief are his capital by 
    means of which he attains happiness in this world and in the Hereafter, and the good pleasure of the Lord, may He be glorified. 
Secondly: 
Whoever makes du’aa’ to his Lord receives an 
    answer in all cases. The answer to prayers is not only getting what one asked for; rather there are two other responses that may come which are: 
    warding off evil from the person who made du’aa’, commensurate with his du’aa’, and storing up the reward for the du’aa’ which the person will 
    receive on the Day of Resurrection.  
Allaah has promised us, on the lips of His 
    Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), that whoever calls upon Him, fulfilling the conditions of du’aa’ will receive one of 
    these responses. It was narrated that Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no Muslim who calls upon Allaah with a du’aa’ in which there is no sin or severing of family 
    ties, but He will give him one of three things: either He will answer his prayer, or he will store up an equal amount of good (reward) for him, or 
    He will ward off an equal amount of evil from him.” They said, “O Messenger of Allaah, then we shall say a lot of du’aa’?” He said, “Allaah most 
    Generous.” 
Narrated by Ahmad, 10709. al-Mundhiri classed 
    its isnaad as jayyid in al-Targheeb wa’l-Tarheeb, 2/479; al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar classed it as saheeh in al-Fath, 11/115. 
All of this is what is meant by the verses 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And your Lord said: ‘Invoke Me [i.e. 
    believe in My Oneness (Islamic Monotheism) and ask Me for anything] I will respond to your (invocation). Verily, those who scorn My worship [i.e. 
    do not invoke Me, and do not believe in My Oneness, (Islamic Monotheism)] they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!’”
[Ghaafir 40:60] 
“And when My slaves ask you (O Muhammad) 
    concerning Me, then (answer them), I am indeed near (to them by My Knowledge). I respond to the invocations of the supplicant when he calls on Me 
    (without any mediator or intercessor). So let them obey Me and believe in Me, so that they may be led aright”
[al-Baqarah 2:186]
It may be better for the person not to get 
    what he asked for his du’aa’, because of evil or fitnah that may result from his getting it, of which he is unaware. So Allaah wards that off from 
    him and gives him something that is better for him in this world, by warding off evil from him, or something that is better for him in the 
    Hereafter, by storing up the reward of the du’aa’ for him. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: 
The du’aa’ in which there is no transgression will be answered, or else the person will be 
    given something equal to it. This is the best response. For the thing that he asked for may be unattainable or may be harmful to the person who 
    prayed or to someone else, but he is ignorant and unaware of the harmful elements in it. But the Lord is Close and Ever-Responsive, and He is more 
    compassionate towards His slaves than a mother towards her child. And He is the Most Generous, Most Merciful: if He is asked for a specific thing 
    and He knows that giving it is not in the best interests of His slave, He will give him something of equal value, as a father does for his child 
    when he asks him for something that is not good for him, so he gives him something of equal worth, and for Allaah is the highest description.
