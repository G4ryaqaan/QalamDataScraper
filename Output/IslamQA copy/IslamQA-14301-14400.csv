14302,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14302,Is It Haram for Women to Wear Tight Clothes?,What is the ruling on women wearing tight clothes in front of women and mahrams?,It is not permissible for Muslim women to wear tight clothes in front of mahrams or other women if they are very tight and show off the woman’s charms.,,"Praise be to Allah.Wearing tight clothes that show off a woman’s charms and that may cause temptation is haram. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There are two types of the people of Hell whom I have not seen: men with whips like the tails of cattle with which they strike the people – i.e., by way of wrongdoing and oppression – and women who are clothed yet naked, astray and leading others astray.” 
The phrase “clothed yet naked” has been interpreted as meaning that they wear short clothes that do not cover the `awrah that should be covered, or as meaning that they wear thin clothes that do not prevent people from seeing the woman’s skin, or as meaning that they wear tight clothes which prevent others from seeing (the skin) but which show off the woman’s charms. 
Based on this, it is not permissible for a woman to wear these tight clothes except in front of the one in front of whom she is permitted to show her `awrah, namely the husband , for there is no `awrah between husband and wife. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Except from their wives or (the slaves) that their right hands possess, for then, they are free from blame” [al-Muminun 23:6]
And `Aishah said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and I used to do ghusl (from janabah) from the same vessel, taking turns to dip our hands in it.” 
So there is no `awrah between a man and his wife . But between a woman and her mahrams, she is obliged to cover her `awrah. It is not permissible to wear tight clothes in front of mahrams or other women, if they are very tight and show off the woman’s charms.

14304,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14304,Ruling on rent-to-own schemes,"What is the ruling on what many companies and banks do nowadays, whereby they rent out a car for a year in return for a specified amount each month, after which time the car becomes the property of the renter, but if he does not complete the agreed-upon rental period, ownership of the car reverts to the company or bank, and the renter has no right to reclaim whatever installments he has paid?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.This kind of transaction is known as “rent-to-own”, and the contemporary scholars have differed concerning it. The Council of Senior Scholars has issued the following statement concerning it: 
The Council of Senior Scholars has studied the issue of rent-to-own schemes, and after discussing the matter, the majority of the Council thinks that this kind of transaction is not permissible in sharee’ah for the following reasons: 
1 – It is a combination of two transactions for one item and is not based on either of them; the two transactions come under two separate rulings and there is a contradiction between the terms of the two transactions. 
When something is sold, the item and its benefits or usage must be transferred to the purchaser, so it is not valid for the seller to receive rent for it because it is the property of the purchaser. When something is rented, that means that the usage or benefits of the item (and not the item itself) are transferred to the renter. 
Selling something implies that the purchaser both owns the item itself and enjoys usage of it, and if it is worn out or destroyed he bears the cost of that and the loss of both the item and its benefits; none of that falls upon the seller. But if something is rented, the owner who is renting it out bears the cost of any loss or any wear or tear to the item or its benefits, unless the renter has transgressed the limits or shown negligence. 
Secondly: The rental fees are calculated on a yearly or monthly basis in such a way that towards the end of the state term, the value of the item is paid off, but the seller calls these payments “rental fees” so that the purchaser cannot not sell the item until he has paid the whole amount.  
For example: If the value of the item in question is fifty thousand riyals and the monthly rent is usually one thousand riyals, he makes it two thousand. In fact this is part of the price until, towards the end of the term, the value of the item is paid. But if the purchaser is unable to make the final payment, for example, the item will be taken away from him on the grounds that it is something rented, and he will not be given back the money that he has paid on the grounds that he has made use of it.  
It is obvious that this is wrongdoing and forcing people to borrow money to make the last payment.  
Thirdly: This kind of contract leads to the poor being careless about debts until many of them end up heavily in debt. It may even lead to bankruptcy for some of the lenders because of losses incurred because of loans to the poor. 
The Council thinks that the two parties should look for a sound way, which is to sell the item and put its price in pledge (rahn) and to protect the seller’s rights by letting him keep the contract document and ownership papers etc.  
And Allah is the Source of Strength. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.

14305,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14305,It is essential to respond to those who defame the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him),"There is no one among us who is unaware of what the Christians say defaming the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and we are not unaware either of the gheerah (protective jealousy) of the young men of the Muslim ummah towards their religion and their Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Is it permissible to respond to those who defame the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) by insulting the speaker, knowing that I insulted one of them and some of my relatives advised me not to do that again, because it will make them defame and mock him even more, so their sin will be on me?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Defaming the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) is a kind of kufr. If that is done by a Muslim then it is apostasy 
    on his part, and the authorities have to defend the cause of Allaah and His 
    Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) by executing the 
    one who defamed him. If the one who defamed him repents openly and is 
    sincere, that will benefit him before Allaah, although his repentance does 
    not waive the punishment for defaming the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him), which is execution. 

    If the person who defames him is a non-Muslim living under a 
    treaty with the Muslim state, then this is a violation of the treaty and he 
    must be executed, but that should be left to the authorities. If a Muslim 
    hears a Christian or anyone else defaming the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) he has to denounce him in strong terms. It 
    is permissible to insult that person because he is the one who started it. 
    How can we not stand up the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him)? It is also obligatory to report him to the authorities who can 
    carry out the punishment on him. If there is no one who can carry out the 
    hadd punishment of Allaah and stand up for the Messenger  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) then the Muslim has to do whatever he can, 
    so long as that will not lead to further mischief and harm against other 
    people. But if a Muslim hears a kaafir defaming the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) and he keeps quiet and does not respond for 
    fear that this person may then defame him even more, this is mistaken 
    thinking. With regard to the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And insult not those 
    whom they (disbelievers) worship besides Allaah, lest they insult Allaah 
    wrongfully without knowledge”

    [al-An’aam 6:108], 

    this does not apply in cases where they defame Allaah and His 
    Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) first. Rather 
    what is meant is that it is forbidden to insult the gods of the mushrikeen 
    first, lest they insult Allaah out of ignorance and enmity on their part. 
    But if they insult Allaah and His Messenger  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) first, then we must respond and punish them so as deter 
    them from their kufr and enmity. If we leave the kuffaar and atheists to say 
    whatever they want without denouncing it or punishing them, great mischief 
    will result, which is something that these kuffaar love. No attention should 
    be paid to the one who says that insulting or responding to insults will 
    make him more stubborn. The Muslim has to have a sense of protective 
    jealousy and get angry for the sake of Allaah and His Messenger  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Whoever hears the Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) being insulted and does not feel any 
    protective jealousy or get angry is not a true believer – we seek refuge 
    with Allaah from humility, kufr and obeying the Shaytaan.

    It is not permissible for any pilgrim to leave Makkah before 
    performing the farewell tawaaf. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was 
    asked: Is it acceptable for those who live in Jeddah to leave Mina and go to 
    Jeddah without performing the farewell tawaaf, then come back a few days 
    later to perform the farewell tawaaf? 

    He replied: 

    It is not permissible for the people of Jeddah or anyone else 
    to go back to their cities before performing the farewell tawaaf, then come 
    back to Makkah when the crowding has become less severe. They should not 
    leave Makkah until they have performed the farewell tawaaf, because the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No one of 
    you should leave until the last thing he has done is to circumambulate the 
    House.” And Ibn ‘Abbaas said: The people used to depart from many locations 
    (within Makkah), but the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said: “No one of you should leave until the last thing he has done is 
    to circumambulate the House.”

    23/353. 

    Even if he comes back after that to perform the farewell 
    tawaaf, it will be of no benefit to him. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: 
If he leaves Makkah 
    heading for Jeddah, and reaches Jeddah, then even if he performs it (the 
    farewell tawaaf) it will be of no benefit to him, because he left, so how 
    can it benefit him after he has left?

But if he slaughters it after it has died then it is not permissible to eat it. This comes under the ruling on animals killed by a violent blow, which Allah has forbidden unless they are properly slaughtered before they die. The slaughter does not count unless it is proven that the animal showed signs of life such as moving a leg or if blood flowed (at the time of slaughter) and so on, which indicates that it was still alive until the slaughtering was over. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Forbidden to you (for food) are: Al‑Maitah (the dead animals — cattle — beast not slaughtered), blood, the flesh of swine, and that on which Allah’s Name has not been mentioned while slaughtering (that which has been slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allah, or has been slaughtered for idols) and that which has been killed by strangling, or by a violent blow, or by a headlong fall, or by the goring of horns — and that which has been (partly) eaten by a wild animal — unless you are able to slaughter it (before its death)” [al-Maa'idah 5:3]

14312,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14312,It is not permissible to replace stoning of an adulterer with killing by the sword or by shooting,"Is it permissible to execute a married adulterer by some method other than stoning, such as killing him with a sword or by shooting him?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    It is essential to stone the married adulterer until he dies, 
    following the Sunnah of the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him), as it is proven that he said that, did it and enjoined it. The 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stoned 
    Maa’iz, the Juhani woman, the Ghaamidi woman, and the two Jews. All of that 
    is proven in saheeh ahaadeeth narrated from the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him). The scholars among the Sahaabah (may 
    Allaah be pleased with them), the Taabi’een and those who came after them 
    are also unanimously agreed on that. No one differed from them apart from 
    those to whose views no attention is to be paid. Al-Bukhaari and Muslim 
    narrated in their Saheehs from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased 
    with him) that ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “Allaah sent 
    Muhammad  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with the truth and 
    revealed to him the Book, and one of the things that Allaah revealed was the 
    verse of stoning. We have read it and understood it. The Messenger of Allaah 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stoned (adulterers) and we 
    stoned (them) after him, but I fear that there may come a time when some 
    people say: ‘By Allaah, we do not find the verse of stoning in the Book of 
    Allaah.’ So they will go astray by forsaking an obligation that Allaah has 
    revealed. According to the Book of Allaah, stoning is deserved by the one 
    who commits zina, if he is married, men and women alike, if proof is 
    established or the woman becomes pregnant or they confess…” 
Based on this, it is not 
    permissible to replace stoning with killing by the sword or shooting, 
    because stoning is a more severe punishment and a more effective deterrent 
    to the sin of zina, which is the most grave sin after shirk and killing a 
    soul whom Allaah has forbidden us to kill. The hadd punishment of stoning 
    for a married person who commits zina is one of the matters that is 
    determined by the Qur’aan and Sunnah and there is no room for ijtihaad or 
    personal opinion. If killing by the sword or shooting were permissible in 
    the case of the married adulterer then the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) would have done that and would have explained it to 
    his ummah, and his companions after him would have done that too.","Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 22/48-49"

Can you enlighten me on what I can do and cannot?","A man may kiss, hug and touch his wife without having intercourse when he is fasting. But if there is the fear that he may do something that Allah has forbidden because his desire is aroused quickly, then it is disliked for him to do that.",,"Praise be to Allah.The Muslim has to protect his fast from things that may invalidate it, and he has to seek reward by giving up his desires for food, drink and intercourse, as Allah says in the Hadith Qudsi concerning the virtues of fasting: “He gives up his food, his drink and his physical desires for My sake.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, As-Sawm, 1761)
But if he can control himself and not slip into that which would cause his fast to be invalidated, by the emission of semen or by having intercourse, or would make his fast imperfect by the emission of Madhiy (prostatic fluid) , then it is permissible for him to embrace his wife in this case, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to fondle `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) but he used to control his desire.
Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“A man may kiss , embrace and touch his wife, without having intercourse , when he is fasting. This is permissible and there is nothing wrong with it, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to kiss and touch his wives when he was fasting. 
But if there is the fear that he may do something that Allah has forbidden because his desire is aroused quickly, then it is disliked for him to do that. If he ejaculates, he still should not eat or drink for the rest of the day, and he has to make up the fast, but he does not have to offer expiation according to the majority of the scholars. However, Madhiy (prostatic fluid) does not invalidate the fast, according to the more correct of the two scholarly views, because the basic principle is that the fast remains valid, and because it is too difficult to avoid.

The Standing Committee was asked about Salaat al-Tasaabeeh, and they answered: 
Salaat al-Tasaabeeh is a bid’ah (innovation) and the hadeeth concerning it is not proven, rather it is munkar. Some of the scholars mentioned it among the mawdoo’ (fabricated) ahaadeeth.

Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: Salaat al-Tasaabeeh is not prescribed, because the hadeeth is da’eef (weak). Imaam Ahmad said there is no sound evidence for it. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said it is a fabrication, and he said that none of the imaams recommended it. He (may Allaah have mercy on him) spoke the truth, because whoever examines this prayer will find that it is odd in the way it is performed … Moreover, if it were prescribed, it would have been something that was reported in many reports because of its great virtue and reward. Since there are no such reports and none of the imaams described it as being recommended, we know that it is not proven. The oddness in the way in which it is performed is as described in the hadeeth narrated concerning it, which says that it is to be performed once every day, or once every week, or once every month, or once every year, or once in a lifetime. This indicates that these reports are not sound; if it were prescribed, it would be something to be done on a regular basis, and one would not be given such a variety of options.

Changing clothes does not break one’s wudu if the person is in a state of purity and does not do any of the things that break wudu. Men and women are the same in this regard. 
What breaks wudu
The things that break wudu are: 

Any discharge from the front or back passage (urine, stools, wind, etc.), except for wind emitted from a woman’s front passage – that does not break wudu. 
Emission of urine or stools from anywhere other than the urethra or anus. 
Losing one’s mind, which may mean losing it altogether by losing one’s mental faculties, which is insanity, or by losing it temporarily for a certain length of time for some reason such as sleep, unconsciousness, intoxication, etc. 
Touching one’s penis , because of the hadith of Basrah bint Safwan, who heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “Whoever touches his penis, let him do wudu.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, al-Taharah, 154. al-Albani said in Sahih Sunan Abi Dawud, no. 166, it is sahih) 
Eating camel meat , because of the hadith of Jabir ibn Samurah, who said that a man asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “Should we do wudu after eating camel meat?” He said, “Yes.” (Narrated by Muslim, al-Hayd, 539). 

It should be noted that touching a woman’s body does not break one’s wudu , whether that is done with feelings of desire or otherwise, unless anything is emitted as a result of that touching.” (See al-Sharh al-Mumti’ by Ibn ‘Uthaymin, vol. 1, p. 219-250) (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, vol. 5, p. 264)

Allaah sent him to all of mankind and made the Qur’aan His miraculous Book until the Day of Resurrection. The Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is also revelation from Allaah. 
It is no wonder that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us of things that were revealed to him from his Lord, and these include information about scientific matters that were unknown at that time. This is a miracle which serves as proof that he is a true Prophet. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was not a doctor but he told of some things that have been confirmed by modern medicine to be true. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not have laboratories or x-rays, but he spoke of things which mankind did not know to be true until after they were tested in laboratories and seen under microscopes.

What is cupping?
Cupping means letting out bad blood that is beneath the skin. 
It is a kind of medical treatment: 
It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Healing is in three things: in the incision of the cupper, in drinking honey and in cauterizing with fire, but I forbid my ummah (nation) to use cauterization.”  
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5356. 
It was narrated that Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “If there is anything good in your medical treatments, it is in the incision of the cupper, drinking honey or in touching with fire when there is certainty that this will cure the disease, but I do not like to be cauterized.” 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5359; Muslim, 2205 
The angels advised the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his ummah to use cupping. 
The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “I did not pass by any group of angels on the night of the Isra’ [the Prophet’s night journey when he was taken from Makkah to Jerusalem and back in the course of a single night], but all of them said to me, “You should use cupping, O Muhammad.” 
Classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 2263. 
Our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was treated by means of cupping: 
It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was treated with cupping when he was in ihraam [a special state of devotion at the time of pilgrimage to Makkah], and he was treated with cupping when he was fasting. 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1836. 
Some of his companions stated that he was treated with cupping for a pain in the head, i.e. a “migraine”. 
It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was treated with cupping in his head for pain when he was in ihraam, at an oasis called Lahi Jamal.  
And it was narrated from him that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was treated with cupping on his head when he was in ihraam for a migraine that he was suffering. 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5374. 
It was narrated from Ibn Buhaynah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was treated with cupping on the way to Makkah when he was in ihraam, in the middle of his head. 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1739; Muslim, 1203. 
Lahi Jamal is a place on the way to Makkah. 
His companions were treated with cupping and they recommended it: 
Muslim (2205) narrated that ‘Aasim ibn ‘Umar ibn Qataadah said:  
Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah came to us and there was a man suffering from an abscess or a wound. He said, “What is wrong with you?” He said, “An abscess that is causing me pain.” He said, “O boy, bring me a cupper.” He said, “What will you do with a cupper, O Abu ‘Abd-Allaah?” He said, “I want to apply a cupping glass to him.” He said, “By Allaah, even if the flies land on me it hurts me, or if my garment touches me it hurts me.” When he saw how reluctant he was, he said, “I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say, ‘If there is anything good in your medical treatments, it is in the incision of the cupper, drinking honey or in touching with fire.’ And the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘But I would not like to be cauterized.’” Then he brought the cupper and made the incision, and his problem went away. 
Recommendation of cupping on certain days of the month
It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:  “The best days for cupping are the seventeenth, nineteenth and twenty first [of the months of the Islamic Hijri calendar]. I did not pass by any group of angels on the night of the Isra’ [the Prophet’s night journey when he was taken from Makkah to Jerusalem and back in the course of a single night], but all of them said to me, “You should use cupping, O Muhammad.” 
Narrated by Ahmad, 3306. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 1847. 
Recommendation to avoid cupping on certain days of the week 
What the questioner has read on our site appears in the book, “Things which are forbidden according to sharee’ah.” 
It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar said: The Messenger of Allaah (S) said: “Cupping on an empty stomach is better, and there is healing and barakah (blessing) in it. It improves clarity of mind and the memory. So use cupping with the blessing of Allaah on Thursdays, and avoid cupping on Wednesdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and use cupping on Mondays and Tuesdays, for that is the day when Allaah relieved Ayyoob (Job) of his afflictions, and He smote him with those afflictions on a Wednesday. So no leprosy begins except on a Wednesday or the night of Wednesday.”

Cupping in modern medicine
Modern medicine has proven that cupping brings many benefits, and numerous books have been written about that, such as al-Dawa’ al-‘Ajeeb alladi shafa min Marad al-Qalb al-Qaatil wa’l-Shalal wa’l-Shaqeeqah wa’l-‘Uqum wa’l-Sarataan wa Marad al-Naa’oor al-Waraathi al-Haemophilia (The Amazing Cure that may heal fatal heart disease, paralysis, migraine, infertility, cancer and the genetic disease haemophilia). This is the most recent and most important book that has been published recently by the researcher ‘Abd al-Qaadir Yahya, which deals with the science of cupping. 
This book is regarded as a scientific reference and medical dictionary that is unique in the world because of its excellent explanations and scientific evidence. It is divided into 12 chapters, covering 500 pages. 
In the last chapter, he quotes clinical reports on the condition of some patients who recovered or whose condition improved with the application of cupping, by comparing the reports on their sickness before cupping and after cupping was applied. He also quotes the testimony of opinions of members of the Syrian medical team who took part in the research on cupping, who numbered 25 clinical and laboratory experts. 
Details of the physical benefits of cupping
1 – Modern science has proven that cupping may be a cure for some heart diseases, some blood diseases and some liver diseases. In cases where the lungs have become swollen because of heart failure, when all means of treatment such as use of diuretics, tying the hands and feet to reduce the flow of blood to the heart have failed, releasing some of the blood by opening a vein may be essential, to bring about a rapid recovery from heart failure. Similarly in the event of a sudden rise in blood pressure accompanied by semi-consciousness and a loss of awareness of time and place, or accompanied by unconsciousness as a result of the sudden increase in blood pressure, releasing some of the blood by opening a vein may be a treatment for such cases. Similarly, for some liver diseases such as cirrhosis there may be no effective remedy apart from releasing some of the blood by opening a vein. There are also some blood diseases which are distinguished by overproduction of red blood cells and a high ratio of haemoglobin in the blood, which require releasing some of the blood by opening a vein, which is the most effective treatment in such cases, so as to avoid further complications. It is worth mentioning that an increase in red blood cells may be the result of living in the mountains at high altitude and a low ratio of oxygen in the air, or it may be the result of intense heat that has an obvious effect of increasing glandular excretions, which leads to an increase in the number of red blood cells. So releasing some of the blood by opening a vein is the appropriate treatment in such cases. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The best of the remedies that you use is cupping.” Narrated by Ahmad, 11634; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 1053. This is a view which is approved by science, as has recently been confirmed by scientific research. 
Ref: al-‘I’jaaz al-‘Ilmi fi’l-Islam wa’l-Sunnah al-Nabawiyyah, by Muhammad Kaamil ‘Abd al-Samad. 
It should be noted that the author used the word fasd (opening a vein, venesection) instead of hijaamah (cupping). It is well known that there is a difference between the two. Fasd (opening a vein) means taking blood from the veins, which is more like having a blood sample taken, and cupping means removing bad blood from beneath the skin. 
2 – Ibn al-Qayyim al-Jawziyyah – who was well-versed in medicine – said: 
Cupping on the upper back helps to relieve pain in the shoulder and throat. Cupping on the veins on the side of the neck is beneficial in relieving  diseases of the head and its parts such as the face, teeth, ears and eyes (and the nose and throat if applicable) which are caused by an excess of blood or corruption thereof, or by both. 
Zaad al-Ma’aad, 4/55, 56 
Al-Tirmidhi (2051) narrated that Anas said: The Messenger of Allaah (S) used to have cupping done on the veins on the side of the neck and the upper back. 
We ask Allaah to make this answer beneficial for you, and we ask Allaah to open your heart to the truth and make it easy for you to do that which He loves and is pleased with.

So it is not permissible for her to appear before you without proper hijab, and it is not permissible for you to be alone with her, or to shake hands with her, or to look at her, or to speak to her except from behind a screen, when there is no fear of fitnah (temptation). Allaah has forbidden the believing women to show their adornment except to specific people. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“…and not to reveal their adornment except to their husbands, or their fathers, or their husband’s fathers, or their sons, or their husband’s sons, or their brothers or their brother’s sons, or their sister’s sons, or their (Muslim) women (i.e. their sisters in Islam), or the (female) slaves whom their right hands possess, or old male servants who lack vigour, or small children who have no sense of feminine sex.

We ask Allaah to bless you with a halaal provision and to compensate you with good. 
With regard to the things you asked about, the details are as follows: 
1 – It is not permissible for a Muslim to take part in the festivals of the kuffaar, such as Christmas and Easter, or to sell the things that will help them in that, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Help you one another in Al‑Birr and At‑Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression”
[al-Maa'idah 5:2]
The same applies to innovated festivals such as Mother’s Day. It is not permissible to sell anything that may help them to celebrate it. 
2 – The basic ruling is that it is permissible to use and sell condoms, unless the vendor knows or thinks it most likely that they will be used for haraam purposes, in which case it is not permissible to sell them. 
The basic principle concerning that – as Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said – is: “Every garment which one thinks will most likely be used for sinful purposes, it is not permissible to sell it or sew it for one who will use it for sinful and wrongful purposes.” (Sharh al-‘Umdah, 4/386) 
This does not apply only to clothes, rather it is general and applies to everything that may be bought or sold. 
3 – It is haraam to sell tobacco and lottery tickets, and every product which is known to involve something that is haraam. 
It says in a fatwa issued by the Standing Committee (13/55): “It is not permissible to deal in tobacco or any haraam things, because they are khabaa’ith (evil and filthy things), and because of the physical, spiritual and financial harm they cause.” 
With regard to the lottery, it is the essence of gambling. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “This method which the questioner mentions, whereby a person buys a ticket and if he is lucky, as he says, he will win a large amount, in included under the heading of gambling of which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Intoxicants (all kinds of alcoholic drinks), and gambling, and Al‑Ansaab (stone altars for offering sacrifices to idols, the jinn, etc), and Al‑Azlaam (arrows for seeking luck or decision) are an abomination of Shaytaan’s (Satan’s) handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) in order that you may be successful.
Shaytaan (Satan) wants only to excite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants (alcoholic drinks) and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of Allaah and from As‑Salaah (the prayer). So, will you not then abstain?
And obey Allaah and the Messenger (Muhammad), and beware (of even coming near to drinking or gambling or Al‑Ansaab, or Al‑Azlaam) and fear Allaah. Then if you turn away, you should know that it is Our Messenger’s duty to convey (the Message) in the clearest way”
[al-Maa'idah 5:90-92]
This gambling – which includes every transaction in which the person will end up either losing and winning, but he does not know whether he will be a winner or a loser – is all haraam; indeed it is one of the major sins.  It is obvious that it is something abhorrent when we realize that Allaah has mentioned it in conjunction with idol-worship, alcohol and al-azlaam (arrows used for seeking luck or decision – a kind of fortune-telling). 
(Fataawa Islamiyyah, 4/441).
 We should note that everything which it is forbidden to do or to use, it is also forbidden to sell, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “May Allaah curse the Jews; animal fat was forbidden to them, so they sold it and consumed its price. When Allaah forbids a thing He also forbids its price.” (Narrated by Ahmad and Abu Dawood, 3026; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, no. 5107).
 4 – It is not permissible to make images of animate beings, whether humans, birds or animals. If that is a three-dimensional image it is even more forbidden.
 On this basis, it is not permissible to sell any of these figures made of ceramic etc., if they are of this nature.  But if they are images of inanimate things such as mountains and other natural scenes, there is nothing wrong with making them and selling them.
 It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 13/73: “Buying and selling images of animate beings is haraam because it was narrated that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Allaah and His Messenger have forbidden the sale of alcohol, dead meat, pork and idols.’ (Agreed upon). That is because it may lead to exaggeration concerning the people depicted, as happened among the people of Nooh… and because of many other texts which also state that it is haraam to make images and to use images of animate beings.”
 5 – With regard to medicines that contain alcohol, if the amount of alcohol contained is large and may cause intoxication if a person drinks a large amount of the medication, then this medication counts as alcohol and it is haraam to use it or sell it. But if the amount of alcohol is little and will not cause intoxication no matter how much is drunk, then it is permissible to use it and sell it.
 It says in a fatwa issued by the Standing Committee concerning the sale of perfumes that contain alcohol: “If the amount of alcohol in the perfume reaches the level where it will cause intoxication if a lot of that perfume is drunk, then drinking that perfume is haraam, dealing in it is haraam, and that applies to all kinds of uses, because it is alcohol, whether it is a lot or a little. But if the thing with which the perfume is mixed, such as alcohol, does not reach the level where drinking a lot of it will cause intoxication, then it is permissible to use it and deal in it, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Whatever causes intoxication in large amounts, a little of it is haraam.’”
(Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 13/54)
 6 – Whatever it is haraam for a Muslim to use, it is also haraam for him to sell it to either Muslims or kaafirs, because the kaafirs are also addressed by the rulings of sharee’ah, including rulings on minor issues, according to the view of the majority of scholars, and what is forbidden for Muslims is also forbidden for them. So it is not permissible to sell them alcohol or pork, or anything else which is proven to be forbidden in our religion, even if we assume that it is permitted to them in their religion, because the sharee’ah of Islam abrogates and corrects the laws that came before it.
 It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah 13/49:
 Question: Is it permissible to deal in alcohol and pork if one does not sell them to a Muslim?
 Answer: It is not permissible to deal in that which Allaah has forbidden, whether that is food or other things, such as alcohol and pork, even if one is dealing with kaafirs, because it was proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When Allaah forbids a thing, He also forbids its price.” (Narrated by Ahmad, no. 2564; Saheeh al-Jaami’, 5107). And because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed alcohol and the one who drinks it, the one who sells it, the one who buys it, the one who carries it, the one to whom it is carried, the one who consumes its price, the one who squeezes out the juice and the one for whom it is squeezed out.” (narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1295; Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 1041).",Islam Q&A
14357,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14357,"If a woman spends on the household, will her share of the inheritance be different?","The Qur'an (4:11)allocates women half a man's share in inheritance.  I presume that the rule that prescribes that women should inherit half a man's share is based on the injunction in the Qur’an(4:34)that men should maintain women. My question is this: what happens if the woman (and not the man) in the family is the main breadwinner? Or, what happens if both the husband and the wife are joint breadwinners? Does this rule then still apply?",,,"Praise be to Allah.and blessings and peace be 
    upon the Messenger of Allaah. 
The female takes half the 
    share of a male in inheritance regardless of whether she works and spends on 
    the household or not, because this is the ruling of Allaah. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allaah commands you as 
    regards your children’s (inheritance): to the male, a portion equal to that 
    of two females”
[al-Nisa’ 4:11]
This means that if a man 
    and woman are co-heirs, then the male’s share is equal to that of two 
    females. An exception is made when uterine brothers and sisters (related 
    through the mother) inherit, in the case of kalaalah, which is 
    mentioned in the passage (interpretation of the meaning): 
“If the man or woman 
    whose inheritance is in question has left neither ascendants nor 
    descendants, but has left a brother or a sister, each one of the two gets a 
    sixth; but if more than two, they share in a third”
[al-Nisa’ 4:12]
The word kalaalah 
    refers to a case where the deceased leaves behind no ascendants or 
    descendents; if he has brothers and sisters through his mother (uterine 
    siblings), then each male receives a share equal to that of one female. 
    Al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “There is consensus on this 
    among the scholars; in the laws of inheritance there is no case where males 
    and females receive equal shares except in the case of uterine siblings”. 
Because of the importance 
    of inheritance, Allaah explained the ruling on how the estate is to be 
    divided Himself, and He did not leave the matter to human reasoning or 
    interpretation. Hence Allaah concluded this aayah with the words 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“(these fixed shares) 
    are ordained by Allaah. And Allaah is Ever All‑Knower, All‑Wise”
[al-Nisa’ 4:11]
Allaah comments on the 
    rulings of inheritance by saying (interpretation of the meaning): 
“These are the limits 
    (set by) Allaah (or ordainments as regards laws of inheritance), and 
    whosoever obeys Allaah and His Messenger (Muhammad) will be admitted to 
    Gardens under which rivers flow (in Paradise), to abide therein, and that 
    will be the great success.
And whosoever disobeys 
    Allaah and His Messenger (Muhammad), and transgresses His limits, He will 
    cast him into the Fire, to abide therein; and he shall have a disgraceful 
    torment”
[al-Nisa’ 4:13-14]
From this it may be known 
    that there is no room for changing or altering these rulings, or to suggest 
    something different, because they came from Allaah, the All-Knowing, 
    All-Wise, Who does not do the slightest injustice to mankind, and Who is 
    more compassionate towards His slaves than a mother to her child. 
Some scholars have sought 
    to explain the reason behind giving males more than females in inheritance 
    by referring to the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Men are the protectors 
    and maintainers of women, because Allaah has made one of them to excel the 
    other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means”
[al-Nisa’ 4:34]
They said that because 
    the man is obliged to spend on the woman, and on her children and servants, 
    and she is spared that obligation, so it is appropriate that his share 
    should be greater than hers. 
This is one of the 
    obvious reasons, no doubt. The great scholar al-Shanqeeti (may Allaah have 
    mercy on him) said in Adwaa’ al-Bayaan: “because the one who in 
    charge of another and spending money on him will always have his money 
    decreasing, and the one who is being looked after and on whom the money is 
    spent is expected to have more. The wisdom of giving precedence to the one 
    on whose money more demands are made over the one whose money is expected to 
    increase is to make up for the expenses of the former. This is sound 
    reasoning.” (1/308). 
It should be noted that 
    Islam preceded all the customs and laws in honouring women and treating them 
    fairly, and allowing them financial independence, whereas European women 
    were, until recently, denied the authority to own anything! 
With regard to what is 
    mentioned in the question about a woman who spends on the household or 
    contributes to the household expenses, the answer is that women are not 
    required to do that, and they can refuse to work or refuse to spend their 
    money that they have earned themselves, and ask their husband to spend on 
    them and provide accommodation for them and their children. If the husband 
    refuses to fulfil this right, then she may ask for a divorce. But if she 
    agrees to spend on him and share the household expenses, then this is a good 
    deed on her part for which she will be rewarded. But it is not obligatory 
    for her to do that, and it has no effect on her share of inheritance. 
It should also be pointed 
    out that this wife may take half the estate of her father or mother, if she 
    has no brothers, or she may inherit from her brother or sister, in addition 
    to whatever she is entitled to from her husband’s estate after he dies. 
And her husband may be in 
    the opposite situation, I mean that he may inherit a small amount from the 
    estate of his father, mother or brothers, or he may not inherit anything.
The point is that the 
    words “to the male, a portion equal to that of two females” have to 
    do with males and females among the children of the deceased; they do not 
    apply to the husband and wife, as each of them have independent sources from 
    which they may inherit.

14367,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14367,Is it permissible to steal from the kuffaar?,Is stealing from the kuffar haram if you live in a kaafir country? The person I'm thinking of is certainly not starving or in need of the things that he steals. It is also rather safe to live as a muslim in this country and the oppression is not grave.,,,"Praise be to Allah.No one is unaware of the fact that stealing is a major sin, for which Allaah has enjoined the punishment of having the hand cut off. Sharee’ah makes no distinction between the wealth of a male and the wealth of a female, or between the wealth of a minor and the wealth of an adult, or between the wealth of a Muslim and the wealth of a kaafir. The only exception made by sharee’ah is the wealth of kaafirs who are waging war against the Muslims. 
The Muslim should be a good example of trustworthiness, honouring agreements and good character. When Muslims have had such characteristics, this has been the cause of many kaafirs entering Islam, because they saw the beauties of Islam and the good character of its people. 
The Muslim who regards the kaafirs’ wealth as permissible, whether he is in a Muslim country or in a kaafir country, is doing the kaafirs a great favour and helping them to distort the image of Islam and Muslims; he is thereby helping those who are launching attacks against Islam. 
When a Muslim enters a kaafir country, it is as if he entering into a peaceful agreement with them – which is the visa which is given to him to enable him to enter their country – so if he takes their wealth unlawfully, then he is breaking that agreement, in addition to being a thief. 
The wealth that he steals from them is haraam. It was narrated that al-Mugheerah ibn Shu’bah kept company with some people during the Jaahiliyyah. He killed them and took their wealth, then he came and entered Islam. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “As for your Islam, I accept it, and as for the wealth, I have nothing to do with it.” According to a report narrated by Abu Dawood, “As for your Islam, we accept it, and as for the wealth it is obtained through treachery, and we have no need of it.”
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2583; Abu Dawood, 2765; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 2403).
Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said: 
The phrase “and as for the wealth, I have nothing to do with it” means, I will not touch it because it was obtained through treachery. What we learn from this is that it is not permissible to take the wealth of the kuffaar by treachery when they have trusted you and granted you safety, because when people accompany one another (when travelling), they do so on the basis of mutual trust, and that trust should not be betrayed, whether the other person is a Muslim or a kaafir. The wealth of the kuffaar is only permissible in the case of combat and war. Perhaps the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) let him keep the wealth in the hope that the people of its owner might become Muslim, then he could return their wealth to them. 
Fath al-Baari, 5/341 
Al-Shaafa’i (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: When a Muslim enters dar al-harb (the non-Muslim lands) on peaceful terms, and finds himself in position to take something of their wealth, it is not permissible for him to take it, whether it is a little or a lot, because if he is safe from them, they should be safe from him, and because it is not permissible for him to take anything from them when they have given him safety except what it is permissible for him to take from the wealth of the Muslims and ahl al-dhimmah (non-Muslims living under the protection of the Muslim state). Wealth may be forbidden for a number of reasons:
If the owner is a Muslim
if the owner is (a non-Muslim) living under the protection of the Muslim state
if the owner is one with whom there is a peace deal, until the deal expires; such people are considered to be like ahl al-dhimmah as far as the sanctity of their wealth is concerned, until the deal expires. 
Al-Umm, 4/284 
Al-Sarkhasi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: It is not right for a Muslim who is on peaceful terms with them to betray them, because betrayal is haraam. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Every betrayer will have a banner by his backside on the Day of Resurrection, by which his betrayal will be known.” If he betrays them and steals their wealth, and brings it to the Muslim lands, it is not right for a Muslim to buy from him if he knows about that, because he has obtained it in an evil manner, and buying from him is encouraging him in that, which it is not right for the Muslim to do. The basic principle in this matter is the hadeeth of al-Mugheerah ibn Shu’bah (may Allaah be pleased with him), when he killed his companions and brought their wealth to Madeenah and became Muslim, and asked the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to take the khums of his wealth, and he said, “As for your Islam, we accept it, and as for the wealth it is obtained through treachery, and we have no need of it.”

They said that he should repeat the prayer if he prayed behind the row on his own. This was also the view of Ahmad and Ishaaq. 
He also narrated this view from Hammaad ibn Abi Sulaymaan, Ibn Abi Layla and Wakee’. 
And he said: Some of the scholars said that his prayer is good enough if he prays behind the row on his own. This is the view of Sufyaan al-Thawri, Ibn al-Mubaarak and al-Shaafa’i. 
The more correct view, which is that of Imam Ahmad and other scholars, is that it is not permissible for a person to pray on his own behind the row if it is possible for him to stand in the row; if he does that (i.e., stands on his own behind the row) then his prayer is invalid and he has to repeat it. 
This is indicated by the hadeeth narrated by Abu Dawood (682), al-Tirmidhi (230) and others, according to which a man prayed on his own behind the row and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded him to repeat the prayer. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Irwa’. 
Al-Mubaarakfoori (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This indicates that prayer offered standing on one's own behind the row is not valid, and that whoever prays on his own behind the row has to repeat his prayer. End quote. 
That is also indicated by the hadeeth narrated by Ahmad (15862) and Ibn Maajah (1003), according to which ‘Ali ibn Shaybaan came in a delegation to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). He said: we prayed behind the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and he saw out of the corner of his eye a man who did not make his back straight when he bowed and prostrated. When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had finished praying, he said: “O Muslims, there is no prayer for one who does not make his back straight when he bows and prostrates.” And he saw a man praying behind the row, so he waited until the man had finished, then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him: “Repeat your prayer, for there is no prayer for a man who stands alone behind the row.” Classed as saheeh by Saheeh Ibn Maajah. 
Al-Sindi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on Ibn Maajah: The apparent meaning of this hadeeth is that the prayer of one who does that is invalid.  
Al-San’aani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
This indicates that the prayer of one who prays behind the row on his own is invalid, because this is the apparent meaning of the hadeeth. 
Al-Nakha’i and Ahmad were also of the view that such a prayer is invalid. Al-Shaafa’i regarded this hadeeth as da’eef (weak) and said: If this hadeeth were proven to be sound I would follow it. Al-Bayhaqi said: The best idea is to avoid doing that because this report is proven to be sound. End quote. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: what is the ruling on praying behind the row on one's own?  
He said: It is not permissible to pray behind the row on one's own and that prayer is not valid, according to the most sound scholarly view. This is the well known view of Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him), although there is another view reported from him which says that it is valid. The view that the prayer of a person who stands on his own behind the row is valid is the view of the other three imams, Maalik, Abu Haneefah and al-Shaafa’i. 
But the more correct view is that it is not valid to pray behind the row on one’s own, unless there is no room to stand in the row. If the row is full and a person prays behind the row standing on his own and following the imam, then he is excused, and one is not obliged to do something that one is unable to do, as was stated by the scholars (may Allah have mercy on them). Fataawa al-Shaykh, 15/193 
In order for the one who does this action that has been asked about to understand the seriousness of it, you should know that some of the scholars are the view that the prayer of the one who prays on his own behind the row is invalid in all cases, even if he cannot find a space in the row. It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah: If a man enters the mosque and the iqaamah for prayer has been given and the row is full, he should try to enter the row. If he cannot do that then he should join the imam and stand on his right. If he cannot do that then he should wait for someone else to come with whom he can form a new row. If no one else comes then he should pray on his own after the congregational prayer finishes.  
The same details were mentioned in another answer given by the Committee, in which it says that it is not sufficient to stand next to boys if they are under the age of discernment. They said: with regard to standing next to boys, if they have reached the age of discernment then standing next to them is valid, but if they have not reached the age of discernment then the ruling is the same as that on one who stands on his own behind the row, and the prayer of one who stands on his own behind the row is not valid, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no prayer for one who stands on his own behind the row.” See Fataawa al-Lajnah, 8/6-7 
Undoubtedly the situation which you have asked about goes completely against the wisdom behind prayer in congregation. Anyone who has the slightest understanding of the aims and purposes of sharee’ah would reject this. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said, after quoting the two ahaadeeth which are stated as evidence that the prayer of one who prays on his own behind the row is invalid: 
More than one of the scholars of hadeeth have classed these two hadeeths as saheeh, and their isnaads are strong. Indeed, in many cases those who disagree with them rely on reports that have weaker isnaads than these two. There is nothing in these two hadeeths that goes against the basic principles of Islam, rather what is in them is what is implied by the well known texts and the basic principles, because prayer in congregation is called jamaa’ah because it brings together (ijtimaa’) the worshippers in doing something at the same time and in the same place. If they cancel out that unity of time or place, such as if all or some of them were to stand in front of the imam, or to keep far back from him with no excuse, that is forbidden according to scholarly consensus. Similarly if they were to be scattered instead of standing together, this is something which is most emphatically forbidden. Rather they are commanded to stand firmly and closely together, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded them to make the rows compact, straight and close together, and to fill all the gaps, starting from the front row. This is all aimed at joining them together in the best way possible. 
If forming rows was not obligatory, then it would be permissible for one person to stand behind another and so on. Everyone knows that this is not the way that Muslims pray. If that were permissible then the Muslims would have done it, even if only once. The same would apply if they made the rows uneven, with one standing ahead of another and one standing back from another. But that is something that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade. 
If they pray in front of the imam, this is better than praying without organized rows. If the majority of scholars say that praying ahead of the imam is not correct, either in all cases or if there is no excuse, how could prayer be valid without having properly organized rows? 
Study of the original sources shows that it is obligatory to pray in rows, and that the prayer of one who stands alone is not valid, as it says in these two hadeeths. If any scholar disagreed with that, then undoubtedly this Sunnah did not reach him in a trustworthy report; he may not have heard it at all, or he may have thought that the hadeeth was da’eef (weak), as some of them said. Majmoo’ Fataawa Shaykh al-Islam, 23/393-395

What is the Muslim explanation behind this, as I wish to correct them (they have fallen from the faith and this may help)?",The idea of reincarnation (transmigration of souls) is a rejection of the texts of the Quran and the Sunnah and a denial of the Resurrection.,"What is reincarnation?


Ruling on reincarnation 


Resurrection in the Quran 


Resurrection in the Sunnah


Does the soul move to another body?","Praise be to Allah.What is reincarnation?
What is meant by reincarnation or the transmigration of souls is that when the body dies, the soul moves to another body, where it will be happy or miserable as a result of its previous actions, and thus it moves from one body to another. 
Ruling on reincarnation 
This is one of the falsest of false beliefs, and one of the worst forms of disbelief in Allah , His Books and His Messengers. For belief in the Hereafter, the Reckoning, Paradise and Hell is among the things that are well-known in the teachings of the messengers and in the words of the Books which were revealed to them. Belief in reincarnation is tantamount to disbelief in all of that. 
Resurrection in the Quran 
The Islamic understanding of the Resurrection is stated clearly in the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). For example, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning]: 
“Everyone shall taste death. Then unto Us you shall be returned.” [al-'Ankabut 29:57]
“To Him is the return of all of you. The Promise of Allah is true. It is He Who begins the creation and then will repeat it, that He may reward with justice those who believed and did deeds of righteousness. But those who disbelieved will have a drink of boiling fluids and painful torment because they used to disbelieve.” [Yunus 10:4] 
“The Day We shall gather the Muttaqun (the pious) unto the Most Gracious (Allah), like a delegation (presented before a king for honour). And We shall drive the Mujrimun (polytheists, sinners, criminals, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah) to Hell, in a thirsty state (like a thirsty herd driven down to water).” [Maryam 19:85-86]
“Verily, He knows each one of them, and has counted them a full counting.  And all of them will come to Him alone on the Day of Resurrection (without any helper, or protector or defender).” [Maryam 19:94-95]
“Allah! La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He). Surely, He will gather you together on the Day of Resurrection about which there is no doubt.” [al-Nisa 4:87]
“The disbelievers pretend that they will never be resurrected (for the Account). Say (O Muhammad): Yes! By my Lord, you will certainly be resurrected, then you will be informed of (and recompensed for) what you did; and that is easy for Allah.” [al-Taghabun 64:7]
 And there are other clear and unambiguous verses.
Resurrection in the Sunnah
There are innumerable references in the Sunnah which mention and confirm the Resurrection, and give details concerning it. For example, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “You will be resurrected barefoot, naked and uncircumcised.” Then he recited (interpretation of the meaning): “As We began the first creation, We shall repeat it. (It is) a promise binding upon Us. Truly, We shall do it” [al-Anbiya 21:104]. (Then he said:) “And the first one to be clothed on the Day of Resurrection will be Ibrahim…” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3100; Muslim, 5104)
 And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “In man there is a bone which will not be consumed by the earth, and from it he will be regenerated on the Day of Resurrection.” They asked, “What bone is that, O Messenger of Allah?” He said, “The tailbone (coccyx).” (Narrated by Muslim, 5255)
And he said: “The sun will be brought close to mankind on the Day of Resurrection until it will be as close to them as a ‘mil’.” Salim ibn ‘Amir [one of the narrators of this hadith] said: “By Allah, I do not know whether by ‘mil’ he meant a distance on land (a mile) or the stick with which kohl is applied to the eyes. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Then the people will be submerged in sweat according to their deeds; some will be in sweat up to their ankles, some up to their knees, some up to their groin and some up to their jaws.” He said: and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) pointed to his mouth. (Narrated by Muslim, 5108)
 And he said: “I will come to the gate of Paradise on the Day of Resurrection and ask for it to be opened. The gatekeeper will ask, ‘Who are you?’ I will say: ‘Muhammad.’ He will say, ‘I was commanded not to open it for anyone before you.’” (Narrated by Muslim, 292)
 And there are other similar ahadith.
 The idea of the transmigration of souls is a rejection of these texts and a denial of the Resurrection.
Does the soul move to another body?
The Islamic teachings concerning torment or blessing in the grave and the questioning of the two angels clearly prove that the soul of man does not move to another body, rather it and the body experience torment or blessing, until mankind will be gathered to their Lord.
Imam Ibn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“It is sufficient refutation of their idea to note that there is consensus among all Muslims that they are disbeleivers and that those who believe in this idea are following something other than Islam, and that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught something other than this.” (al-Fisal fi’l-Milal wa’l-Ahwa wa’l-Nihal, 1/166)
The belief that the body will perish and will not be restored to experience blessing or punishment is a means that leads man to indulge in desires, wrongdoing and evil. This is what the Shaytan wants for those who follow this corrupt belief, in addition to pushing them further into kufr when he makes them believe in this false idea.
 What you must do is to advise this person and remind him of the words of Allah and the words of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and call him to repent from this disbelief. If he repents and turns to Allah, all well and good, otherwise keep away from him and warn others against listening to him, and tell people that you reject his beliefs, lest people be deceived by him.

14380,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14380,Her husband wants her to remove the hair from her arms and legs,"One of the Sunnahs of the fitrah is to remove the armpit hair and pubic hair. Can a woman remove hair from the arms and legs, knowing that this is difficult for the woman? If the husband asks his wife to do that and she refuses because of the pain it causes her and because it takes too much time, what is the Islamic view on that? Is it permissible for her to do that by going to a salon?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: the hair on the arms and legs is something about 
    which sharee’ah does not say anything. If sharee’ah does not say anything 
    about a matter, it is allowable. It does not come under the same heading as 
    the hair which we are commanded or recommended to remove, and it does not 
    come under the heading of the hair which we commanded to leave alone – such 
    as the hair on a woman’s head and the eyebrows. 

    Because sharee’ah does not say anything about it, the 
    scholars differed concerning it. Some of them said that it is not 
    permissible to remove it, because removing it is changing the creation of 
    Allaah, and Allaah tells us that the Shaytaan said: 

    “ ‘and indeed I will order them to change the nature 
    created by Allaah’”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:119 – interpretation of the meaning]

    Others said that it is permissible to remove it because it is 
    one of the things concerning which sharee’ah did not say anything, so the 
    ruling is that it is permissible, since whatever sharee’ah did not say 
    anything about in the Qur’aan or Sunnah is allowable, as it says in the 
    hadeeth: “What is halaal is that which Allaah has permitted in His Book, and 
    what is haraam is that which Allaah has forbidden in His Book, and whatever 
    He has not said anything about is allowable.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1726; 
    classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 

    The view that it is permitted is the view favoured by the 
    Standing Committee, and also by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen. See Fataawa 
    al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah, 3/879; Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 11/q. 64. 

    See also questions no.
    9037,
    742,
    451. 

    Secondly: It is mustahabb for husband and wife to make 
    themselves look good for one another, because Allaah says (interpretation of 
    the meaning): 

    “and live with them honourably”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:19] 

    “And they (women) have rights similar (to those of their 
    husbands) over them to what is reasonable”

    [al-Baqarah 2:228]
It is customary for 
    spouses to make themselves look good for one another. If the husband tells 
    his wife to make herself look good for him, then it becomes obligatory for 
    her to do so, because that is his right and because obeying the husband in 
    that which is good and proper is obligatory for her. Al-Mawsoo’ah 
    al-Fiqhiyyah, maadat al-tazayyun, 11/271. 

    Based on this, if the husband tells his wife to remove the 
    hair on her arms and legs, and that will not cause her any harm or involve 
    her doing something haraam, then it is obligatory for her to do that. The 
    husband should forego his right to ask his wife to do that if she convinces 
    him that this causes her hardship or she does not want to do it and so on. 

    Thirdly: with regard to going to a salon to do this, there is 
    nothing wrong with that, so long as the following conditions are met: 

    1-That should be done by a woman, 
    with no men present. The place should also be one where the people can be 
    trusted, especially nowadays when cameras etc are readily available and many 
    people are corrupt.

    2-The women should not see any 
    part of her ‘awrah such as the thighs. It should be limited only to the arms 
    and lower legs as Shaykh al-‘Uthaymeen said (al-Liqa’ al-Shahri, q. 
    278)

    3-The salon should not be a place 
    where ‘awrahs are uncovered. The scholars have stated that it is haraam for 
    a woman to enter public baths because they are places where ‘awrahs are 
    uncovered. Al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The public baths 
    are definitely haraam for women. It was narrated that Abu Maleeh said: Some 
    women from Syria entered upon ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) and 
    she said: “Who are you?” They said: “From the people of Syria.” She said: 
    “Perhaps you are from al-Koorah where women enter the public baths?” They 
    said: “Yes.” She said: “I heard the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) say: ‘There is no woman who takes off her clothes 
    anywhere but in her own house, but she has torn (the veil of modesty) 
    between her and Allaah.’” Narrated by the authors of the four Sunans, 
    and its isnaad is saheeh according to the conditions of al-Saheehayn.

          because zina is one of the major sins which are forbidden in Islam and 
          for which a stern warning is issued to the one who does them. Allaah 
          says (interpretation of the meaning):  
“And 
          those who invoke not any other ilaah (god) along with Allaah, nor kill 
          such person as Allaah has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit

The 
          punishment must be carried out in this world on the one who has committed 
          zina (fornication or adultery), as Allaah says (interpretation of the 
          meaning):  
“The 
          fornicatress and the fornicator, flog each of them with a hundred stripes. 
          Let not pity withhold you in their case, in a punishment prescribed 
          by Allaah, if you believe in Allaah and the Last Day. And let a party 
          of the believers witness their punishment”

It 
          was narrated in a hadeeth from the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Receive (teaching) from 
          me, receive (teaching) from me. Allaah has ordained a way for those 
          (women). When an unmarried male commits adultery with an unmarried female, 
          (they should receive) one hundred lashes and banishment for one year. 
          And in the case of a married male committing adultery with a married 
          female, they shall receive one hundred lashes and be stoned to death.” 
          
(Narrated 
          by Muslim, al-Hudood, 3199).
Allaah 
          has forbidden the believers to marry a person who commits zina, whether 
          man or woman. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  
“The 
          adulterer — fornicator marries not but an adulteress — fornicatress 
          or a Mushrikah; and the adulteress –fornicatress, none marries her except 
          an adulterer — fornicater or a Mushrik [and that means that the man 
          who agrees to marry (have a sexual relation with) a Mushrikah (female 
          polytheist, pagan or idolatress) or a prostitute, then surely, he is 
          either an adulterer — fornicator, or a Mushrik (polytheist, pagan or 
          idolater). And the woman who agrees to marry (have a sexual relation 
          with) a Mushrik (polytheist, pagan or idolater) or an adulterer — fornicator, 
          then she is either a prostitute or a Mushrikah (female polytheist, pagan, 
          or idolatress)]. Such a thing is forbidden to the believers (of Islamic 
          Monotheism)” 
[al-Noor 
          24:3]
If 
          the one who has committed zina repents to Allaah, truly and sincerely, 
          then Allaah will forgive him or her, and overlook the sin. Allaah says, 
          after mentioning the warning to those who commit zina:  
“Except 
          those who repent and believe (in Islamic Monotheism), and do righteous 
          deeds; for those, Allaah will change their sins into good deeds, and 
          Allaah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful. 
And 
          whosoever repents and does righteous good deeds; then verily, he repents

[al-Furqaan

If 
          the person repents sincerely, then it becomes permissible for him or 
          her to get married, after they give up this sin.   
Shaykh 
          Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem was asked about the ruling on getting married 
          to a woman who has committed zina. He said: “it is not permissible to 
          marry the woman who has committed adultery until she repents… if a man 
          wants to marry her, he has to be sure that she is not pregnant, by waiting 
          until she has a period before he does the marriage contract with her. 
          If she is pregnant, then it is not permissible for him to marry her 
          until she has given birth.”

Hence al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) gave one chapter (of his Saheeh) the title, “One should not do wudu based on doubt until one is certain,” in which is narrated the hadeeth of ‘Abbaad ibn Tameem from his paternal uncle, that a man complained to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that he imagined that he felt something whilst praying. He said: “Do not stop (praying) unless you hear a sound or notice a smell.” (al-wudu, 134). None of these whispers and thoughts break one’s wudu. 
But if a person is certain that something has come out of him, then in this case his wudu is broken. If a person is faced with such whispers, he has to ignore them and assume that he is taahir (pure), because if he thinks too much about this matter, the whispers will persist. 
With regard to wind emitted from a woman’s vagina, this does not break wudu. The Standing Committee was asked about wind being passed from a woman’s vagina during prayer.

    the dead. It is similar to the actions of those who venerated the righteous 
    and made symbols (of the dead). There is the fear that this may, with the 
    passage of time, lead to building domes over their graves, seeking blessing 
    from them and taking them as gods alongside Allaah. So we must not do that, 
    in order to avoid the means that lead to shirk.","Al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, from Kitaab Fataawa Islamiyyah, 1/20"
14392,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14392,His brain-damaged sister died – what will her fate be?,"My sister was born brain damaged meaning that even though she had a physical appearance of a 16 years old, She had the mental age of a 4 year old, She was unable to write nor read.
My sister died about a month ago, and i was wondering whether she would go to Heaven or Hell?",,,"Praise be to Allah.and blessings and peace be upon the Messenger of Allaah. 
We ask Allaah to have mercy on her, and to join you with her in the Gardens of Delight (Paradise). 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Every child is born in state of fitrah (the natural disposition of man), then his parents make him a Jew or a Christian or a Magian.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1296; Muslim, 4803). 
And he said: “The pen is lifted from three (i.e., their deeds are not recorded): the sleeper until he awakes, the child until he grows up, and the insane until he regains his sanity or regains consciousness.” This was narrated by the authors of Sunan and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Irwa’, no. 297. 
If a child is born lacking mental faculties or brain-damaged, and his parents are Muslim, then he is Muslim too. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “The ruling on one who is insane is like the ruling on a child: if his parents are Muslim then he is also Muslim. This is according to the consensus of the Muslims. The same applies if his mother is Muslim, according to the majority of scholars such as Abu Haneefah, al-Shaafa’i and Ahmad. Similarly, one who become insane after becoming Muslim is also regarded as a Muslim. An insane person who was born in a Muslim society is also regarded as being outwardly Muslim, like his parents or the people of the society, as is also the ruling on children. The children of the Muslims and their insane will be like their fathers (i.e., they will be counted as Muslims) on the Day of Resurrection.”
(Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 10/437) 
Ibn Hazm (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “As for the insane who have no mental faculties until they die, as we have already mentioned, they are born as ‘haneefs’ (monotheists) and believers, and they do not change their faith, so they die as believers and so they will go to Paradise.” (al-Fasl 4/135). 
So if your sister had no mental faculties or power of discernment, and she did not understand the meaning of worship or how to do it, then the pen was lifted from her (and her deeds were not recorded), so she was still adhering to the fitrah, and we hope that she will enter Paradise. But we cannot testify that any specific person will go to Paradise, apart from those whom the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) testified would go there. 
But if she had mental faculties and could understand things, then she is accountable like everyone else, and she will be rewarded or punished for whatever she did after she reached adolesence. If she was fine sometimes and not at others, then she will be rewarded or punished for whatever she did at the times when her reason was sound.

14393,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14393,Ruling on opening mosques with celebrations and gathering for that purpose,"When a new mosque is built and they want to start praying in it, they invite people from the neighbouring countries and they gather for what they call the opening of the mosque. What is the ruling on their doing this? Does the hadeeth “Do not travel to visit any mosque except three…” indicate that this is haraam? If it is permissible, what is the evidence for that? Does the hadeeth which says that one of the Sahaabah invited the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to pray in a corner of his house so that he could take it as a prayer-place (musalla) indicate that it is permissible? Is there any evidence in the fact that in the story of Masjid al-diraar (the mosque built by the hypocrites) Allaah only forbade the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to go there because the mosque was built for the purpose of causing harm and was based on kufr?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Mosques are opened by praying in them and maintaining them 
    with the remembrance of Allaah (dhikr), reading Qur’aan, glorifying and 
    praising Allaah, declaring His Oneness, teaching knowledge of sharee’ah, and 
    other things that will show respect to the place. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“In houses (mosques) 
    which Allaah has ordered to be raised (to be cleaned, and to be honoured), 
    in them His Name is remembered [i.e. Adhaan, Iqaamah, Salaah (prayers), 
    invocations, recitation of the Qur’aan]. Therein glorify Him (Allaah) in the 
    mornings and in the afternoons or the evenings,

    Men whom neither trade nor sale (business) diverts from 
    the remembrance of Allaah (with heart and tongue) nor from performing 
    As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as-Salaah) nor from giving the Zakaah. They fear a Day 
    when hearts and eyes will be overturned (out of the horror of the torment of 
    the Day of Resurrection).

    That Allaah may reward them according to the best of their 
    deeds, and add even more for them out of His Grace. And Allaah provides 
    without measure to whom He wills”[al-Noor 24:36-38]

    In these ways and others, by offering religious advice, 
    exhortation and consultation, the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to maintain the mosque, and he was 
    followed in that by the Rightly-Guided Khaleefahs and by all his Sahaabah 
    and the guided imams after him (may Allaah be pleased with them and have 
    mercy on them). All goodness resides in following their guidance and 
    adhering to their example in opening mosques and maintaining them as they 
    did, with acts of worship and other symbols of Islam. It was not narrated 
    that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or any of 
    the guided imams opened a mosque with celebrations or invitations like those 
    that people do nowadays, gathering from all over the country when the 
    building is complete to honour it. If that was a praiseworthy action, then 
    the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    would have been the first of people to do it and he would have prescribed it 
    as Sunnah for his ummah, and the Rightly-Guided Khaleefahs and guided imams 
    who came after him would have done it too. And if that had happened, it 
    would have been reported. 
On this basis, these 
    celebrations should not be held. It is not recommended to invite people to 
    such events or to help with them by giving money or in other ways. All good 
    resides in following those who went before (the salaf) and evil resides in 
    following those who came later. The fact that one of the Sahaabah invited 
    the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to 
    his house to pray two rak’ahs in one part of it so that the owner of the 
    house could take that as a prayer-place for praying whatever he could of 
    naafil prayers does not form evidence to support the modern practice of 
    holding celebrations to open mosques, because he (the Sahabi) did not invite 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to a 
    celebration, rather he invited him to pray, and he did not travel in order 
    to offer that prayer. Moreover, travel to attend this celebration or to pray 
    in that mosque comes under the general meaning of the prohibition on 
    traveling to pray in mosques other than the three famous mosques [i.e., 
    al-Masjid al-Haraam in Makkah, al-Masjid al-Nabawi in Madeenah and Masjid 
    al-Aqsa in al-Quds/Jerusalem]. So we should shun this innovated practice and 
    be content – with regard to mosques and other matters – with the things that 
    were done at the time of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) and the guided imams who followed him (may Allaah 
    have mercy on them).",Islam Q&A - Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
14394,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14394,Afraid of marriage out of fear of committing sin,"I have not got married yet. I know that it is not permissible for the husband to have intercourse with his wife in her back passage, but I do not want to hide from you the fact that my desires always overwhelm me. I try to repent and do what is right, but sometimes I go back to sin. I am afraid that if I get married I will have intercourse with my wife in her back passage, and that the Shaytaan will overpower me. What advice can you give me? 
My second question is: would it be permissible for me to approach her from behind but over her clothes?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is emphatically forbidden to have intercourse with one's wife in her back passage, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever has intercourse with a menstruating woman or with a woman in her back passage, or goes to a fortuneteller and believes what he says, has disbelieved in that which was revealed to Muhammad.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 135; Ibn Maajah, 639; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
And he said: “Cursed is the one who has intercourse with a woman in her back passage.” Narrated by Ahmad, 9731; Abu Dawood, 2162; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. See also question no. 1103. 
With regard to your avoiding marriage because of these fears, this is dealing with one mistake by making another. Ignore this waswaas (whisper from the Shaytaan) and keep busy with things that will benefit you in both spiritual and worldly ways. Ask Allaah to purify your heart and protect your chastity; hasten to get married for that is the best remedy for you. Beware of the wrath and anger of Allaah and of His painful punishment, and do not be one of those who are heedless. 
Remember Allaah a great deal and do lots of acts of worship, lower your gaze and avoid looking at haraam things, and avoid committing sinful actions, so that these evil devilish thoughts will leave you. 
With regard to coming to your wife from behind but over her clothes, you should avoid doing that. Do not be like a shepherd who grazes his flocks around a sanctuary and soon transgresses its boundary, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 25; Muslim, 1599). 
Ibn Rajab (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
Allaah has guarded these haraam things and forbidden His slaves to approach them, and he calls them His limits. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“These are the limits (set) by Allaah, so approach them not. Thus does Allaah make clear His Ayaat (proofs, evidences, lessons, signs, revelations, verses, laws, legal and illegal things, Allaah’s set limits, orders, etc.) to mankind that they may become Al-Muttaqoon (the pious)”
[al-Baqarah 2:187]
Thus it is clear that Allaah has defined for them what is permissible for them and what is forbidden to them, so that they will not approach what is forbidden and they will not go beyond what is permitted. Hence Allaah says in another verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“These are the limits ordained by Allaah, so do not transgress them. And whoever transgresses the limits ordained by Allaah, then such are the Zaalimoon (wrongdoers)”
[al-Baqarah 2:229]
The one who grazes around a sanctuary and close to it will soon enter it. The same applies to one who goes beyond what is permitted and falls into doubtful areas. He approaches something haraam with the intention of merely coming close, but soon he will commit forbidden actions blatantly. This indicates that we must keep away from haraam things, and erect barriers between us and them. 
Jaami’ al-‘Uloom wa’l-Hukam, 1/208 
May Allaah protect us and you from all evils, and make us and you content with that which He has permitted. May He give us enough of what is permissible that we have no need of that which He has forbidden.

14397,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14397,What is the meaning of the words “I am his hearing with which he hears…” etc?,"What is the meaning of Allaah’s words in the hadeeth qudsi, “When I love him I am his hearing with which he hears, his seeing with which he sees, his hand with which he strikes and his foot with which he walks”?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    If the Muslim does the obligatory acts that Allaah has 
    enjoined upon him, then he strives to draw closer to Allaah by doing naafil 
    (supererogatory) acts of worship and persists in that as much as he can, 
    then Allaah will love him and will help him in all that he does or does not 
    do. So when he hears he will be guided by Allaah with regard to what he 
    hears, and he will not hear anything but what is good, and he will not 
    accept anything but the truth, and falsehood will be kept away from him, by 
    the help and support of Allaah. So he will see the truth as truth and 
    falsehood as falsehood, and when he strikes anything he will strike with 
    power from Allaah, so his strike will be like a strike from Allaah in 
    support of the truth.  And when he walks he will be walking in obedience to 
    Allaah, seeking knowledge, striving in jihad for the sake of Allaah. To sum 
    up, all that he does, both inwardly and outwardly, will be guided and 
    supported by Allaah. 

    Hence it becomes clear that there is nothing in this hadeeth 
    to indicate that Allaah is “incarnated” in His creation or that He becomes 
    one with any of them. This is shown by the words at the end of the hadeeth, 
    where Allaah says: “Were he to ask [something] of Me, I would surely give it 
    to him, and were he to ask Me for refuge, I would surely grant him it.”  
    According to some reports, He also said, “So by My help he hears and by My 
    help he sees…”  This explains what is meant at the beginning of the hadeeth, 
    and it clearly demonstrates that there is one who asks and One Who is asks, 
    one who seeks refuge and One Who grants refuge [i.e., two separate 
    entities]. This hadeeth is similar to another hadeeth qudsi: “Allaah says: 
    ‘O My slave, I fell sick and you did not visit Me…’” In both cases, the 
    latter part of the hadeeth explains the first part, but those who are led by 
    their whims and desires follow the ambiguous texts and ignore the clear and 
    unambiguous texts, and so they go astray.","Al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, Kitaab Fataawa Islamiyyah, 1/35"
