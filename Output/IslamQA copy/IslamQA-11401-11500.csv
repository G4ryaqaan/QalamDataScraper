11402,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11402,Du`a is to be made to Allah alone,What is the ruling on making du`a to anyone other than Allah?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Allah is close to His slaves; he sees where they are and He knows their situation. He hears what they say and responds to their du`a (supplication). Nothing about them is hidden from Him, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Truly, nothing is hidden from Allah, in the earth or in the heaven” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:5] 
Allah Alone is the One Who has created us and Who provides for us; in His hand is the dominion and He is Able to do all things: 
“To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is therein, and He is Able to do all things”
[al-Maa'idah 5:17 – interpretation of the meaning] 
In Allah’s hand alone is all goodness. When He calls mankind to something good in His Book or on the lips of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), they should obey that command and respond to it: 
“O you who believe! Answer Allah (by obeying Him) and (His) Messenger when he calls you to that which will give you life, and know that Allah comes in between a person and his heart (i.e. He prevents an evil person to decide anything). And verily, to Him you shall (all) be gathered” [al-Anfaal 8:24 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Allah is Able to do all things, and He hears the supplication of His slaves. He responds to them at all times and in all places, no matter what their various needs and languages. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And when My slaves ask you (O Muhammad) concerning Me, then (answer them), I am indeed near (to them by My Knowledge). I respond to the invocations of the supplicant when he calls on Me (without any mediator or intercessor). So let them obey Me and believe in Me, so that they may be led aright
[al-Baqarah 2:186] 
Allah has commanded us to call upon Him in secret, with humility and submission, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Invoke your Lord with humility and in secret. He likes not the aggressors” [al-A’raaf 7:55] 
To Allah belongs Dominion and to Him be praise, and He is Able to do all things. The heavens and the earth and everything in them glorifies Him, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The seven heavens and the earth and all that is therein, glorify Him and there is not a thing but glorifies His Praise. But you understand not their glorification. Truly, He is Ever Forbearing, Oft‑Forgiving” [al-Israa’ 17:44] 
Allah has promised Hell to those who are too arrogant to worship Him and call upon Him. He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, those who scorn My worship [i.e. do not invoke Me, and do not believe in My Oneness, (Islamic Monotheism)] they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!”[Ghaafir 40:60] 
Du`a should be made to Allah in the manner that Allah and His Messenger have prescribed. For example, Allah should be called upon by His Most Beautiful Names: 
“And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allah, so call on Him by them, and leave the company of those who belie or deny (or utter impious speech against) His Names. They will be requited for what they used to do” [al-A’raaf 7:180 – interpretation of the meaning] 
So we may say O Most Merciful, have mercy on us, O Ever-Forgiving, forgive us, O Provider grant us provision, and so on. 
When a person makes du`a , either Allah gives him what he asked for or He diverts it from him a harm that is greater than the thing he asked for, or He stores up what he has asked for, for the Hereafter. This is because Allah has commanded us to call upon Him and He has promised to respond to our call: 
“And your Lord said: ‘Invoke Me [i.e. believe in My Oneness (Islamic Monotheism) and ask Me for anything] I will respond to your (invocation)’ [Ghaafir 40:60 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Allah has commanded us to worship Him alone, and He has warned us against worshipping the Shaytaan. He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Did I not command you, O Children of Adam, that you should not worship Shaytaan (Satan). Verily, he is a plain enemy to you.
And that you should worship Me [Alone Islamic Monotheism, and set up not rivals, associate‑gods with Me]. That is the Straight Path” [Yaa-Seen 36:60-61] 
Calling upon anyone other than Allah to meet one’s needs, relieve distress or heal disease is insanity caused by lack of understanding: 
“Say (O Muhammad): ‘Shall we invoke others besides Allah (false deities), that can do us neither good nor harm, and shall we turn back on our heels after Allah has guided us (to true Monotheism)?’” [al-An’aam 6:71 – interpretation of the meaning]  
If a person calls upon one who cannot bring benefit or cause harm, who cannot command or prohibit, who cannot hear or respond, whether that is a Prophet, a Messenger, a jinn or an angel, or a star or planet or rock or tree, or one of the dead – all of that is serious wrong-doing, and a going astray from the Straight Path. It is shirk, the association of others with Allah the Almighty. 
“And invoke not besides Allah any such that will neither profit you nor harm you, but if (in case) you did so, you shall certainly be one of the Zaalimoon (wrongdoers)” [Yoonus 10:106 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And who is more astray than one who calls  on (invokes) besides Allah, such as will not answer him till the Day of Resurrection, and who are (even) unaware of their calls (invocations) to them
[al-Ahqaaf 46:5] 
Calling upon anyone or anything other than Allah is shirk, and shirk is a great sin, indeed it is the greatest sin. Allah will forgive any sin for whomever He wills, except for shirk, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, Allah forgives not that partners should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He wills [al-Nisaa’ 4:48] 
On the Day of Resurrection, Allah will gather the mushrikeen and everyone who was worshipped instead of Him, then those who were worshipped instead of Allah will disavow those who worshipped them, and they will deny their association with Allah, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And those, whom you invoke or call upon instead of Him, own not even a Qitmeer (the thin membrane over the date stone).
If you invoke (or call upon) them, they hear not your call; and if (in case) they were to hear, they could not grant it (your request) to you. And on the Day of Resurrection, they will disown your worshipping them. And none can inform you (O Muhammad) like Him Who is the All‑Knower (of everything).
O mankind! it is you who stand in need of Allah. But Allah is Rich (Free of all needs), Worthy of all praise”[Faatir 35: 13-15]","From Usool al-Deen al-Islami, by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem al-Tuwayjri"
11403,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11403,Enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil,Why do the Muslims consider enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil to be one of the basic principles of their religion?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Man is very forgetful and makes a lot of mistakes. His own self (nafs) tells him to do evil and the Shaytaan tempts him to commit sin. When bodies get sick and are afflicted with disease, one has to find a doctor who can prescribe the appropriate medicine so that the body may be restored to full health. Similarly, souls and hearts may be afflicted with the diseases of desire and doubt, so people do things which Allah has forbidden, such as shedding blood, committing adultery, drinking alcohol, oppressing people and consuming their wealth unlawfully, preventing people from following the way of Allah and disbelieving in Allah. 
The diseases of the heart [psychological and spiritual diseases] are worse than diseases of the body. This means that one must find a doctor who is skilled in treating such diseases. Because the diseases of the heart are so many and cause the spread of evil and corruption, Allah has enjoined the believers to treat these diseases, by enjoining that which is good and forbidding that which is evil. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Let there arise out of you a group of people inviting to all that is good (Islam), enjoining Al-Ma‘roof (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do) and forbidding Al-Munkar (polytheism and disbelief and all that Islam has forbidden). And it is they who are the successful” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:104] 
Enjoining what is good (al-ma’roof) and forbidding what is evil (al-munkar) is one of the most important Islamic duties, indeed it is the noblest and most sublime. This is the task of the Prophets and Messengers (peace be upon them all), as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Messengers as bearers of good news as well as of warning in order that mankind should have no plea against Allah after the (coming of) Messengers” [al-Nisaa’ 4:165] 
Allah has made the Muslim ummah the best nation ever raised up for mankind, in order to do this important task, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):  
“You (true believers in Islamic Monotheism, and real followers of Prophet Muhammad and his Sunnah) are the best of peoples ever raised up for mankind; you enjoin Al-Ma‘roof (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam has ordained) and forbid Al-Munkar (polytheism, disbelief and all that Islam has forbidden), and you believe in Allah” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:110] 
If the ummah fails to do its duty of enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, wrongdoing and corruption will spread throughout the ummah, and it will deserve the curse of Allah. For Allah cursed those among the Children of Israel who disbelieved because they failed in this important duty. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Those among the Children of Israel who disbelieved were cursed by the tongue of Dawood (David) and ‘Eesa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary). That was because they disobeyed (Allah and the Messengers) and were ever transgressing beyond bounds.
They used not to forbid one another from Al-Munkar (wrong, evildoing, sins, polytheism, disbelief) which they committed. Vile indeed was what they used to do [al-Maa’idah 5:78] 
Enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil is one of the basic principles of this religion, and doing this is jihaad for the sake of Allah. Jihaad requires putting up with difficulties and bearing insults and harm with patience, as Luqmaan said to his son: 
“O my son! Aqim-is-Salaah (perform As-Salaah), enjoin (on people) Al-Ma‘roof  (Islamic Monotheism and all that is good), and forbid (people) from Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief in the Oneness of Allah, polytheism of all kinds and all that is evil and bad), and bear with patience whatever befalls you. Verily, these are some of the important commandments (ordered by Allah with no exemption” [Luqmaan 31:17 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil is an important mission, hence those who undertake this mission must be of good character and must understand the objectives of sharee’ah; they must call people with wisdom and fair preaching and deal with them in a kind and gentle manner, so that Allah may guide those whom He wills at their hands. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Invite (mankind, O Muhammad) to the way of your Lord (i.e. Islam) with wisdom (i.e. with the Divine Revelation and the Qur’aan) and fair preaching, and argue with them in a way that is better. Truly, your Lord knows best who has gone astray from His path, and He is the Best Aware of those who are guided” [al-Nahl 16:125] 
The ummah which establishes the symbols of Islam, enjoins what is good and forbids what is evil, will attain happiness in this world and in the Hereafter. Allah will send them His support and grant them victory, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, Allah will help those who help His (Cause). Truly, Allah is All-Strong, All-Mighty.
Those (Muslim rulers) who, if We give them power in the land, (they) enjoin Iqamaat-as-Salaah [i.e. to perform the five compulsory congregational Salaah (prayers) (the males in mosques)], to pay the Zakaah and they enjoin Al-Ma‘roof (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do), and forbid Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism and all that Islam has forbidden) [i.e. they make the Qur’aan as the law of their country in all the spheres of life]. And with Allah rests the end of (all) matters (of creatures)” [al-Hajj 22:40-41] 
Enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil is a mission which will never end until the Hour begins. It is obligatory upon all the ummah, rulers and subjects, men and women, each according to his or her circumstances. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever among you sees an evil action, let him change it with his hand [by taking action]; and if he cannot, then with his tongue [by speaking out]; and if he cannot, then with his heart [by feeling that it is wrong] – and that is the weakest of faith.” (Narrated by Muslim, 49) 
The Muslim ummah is one nation, and if corruption becomes widespread in it and its circumstances turn bad, then all the Muslims are obliged to reform it, rid it of evil things, enjoin what is good and forbid what is bad, and offer sincere advice to all. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:
“Religion is sincerity.” We said, “To whom?” He said, “To Allah and His Book, and His Messenger, and to the leaders of the Muslims and their common folk.” (Narrated by Muslim, 95). 
If a Muslim is commanded to do something, he should be the quickest of people to do it, and if he is forbidden to do something, he must be the one who keeps furthest away from it. Allah has issued a warning to those who go against that, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Why do you say that which you do not do?
Most hateful it is with Allah that you say that which you do not do” [al-Saff 61:2-3] 
No matter how righteous a person may be, he still needs sincere advice, guidance and reminders in the light of the Qur’aan and Sunnah. Allah said to the Messenger of the Lord of the Worlds, the most perfect of all creation (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O Prophet (Muhammad)! Keep your duty to Allah, and obey not the disbelievers and the hypocrites (i.e., do not follow their advice). Verily, Allah is Ever All-Knower, All-Wise” [al-Ahzaab 33:1] 
So we must all enjoin that which is good and forbid that which is evil, so that we may attain the Pleasure of Allah and His Paradise.","From Usool al-Deen al-Islami, by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem al-Tuwayjri"
11404,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11404,Her sister is friends with a homosexual man (we seek refuge with Allaah),"My sister has recently disturbed me in the last couple of months. I started to search for a lot of truth with my life, so I tried to learn more about Islam and I am succeeding.(Alhamdullilah)I have also stopped watching television which has helped clear my head in a tremondous way, It's been I would say about 5 months since I didn't watch. She has this homosexual friend and she thinks there's nothing wrong with him. I am horrified to say this, but she even went to a drag-queen show(homosexual bar with him.Iam extremely concerned with her because after having seen this her 'niya"" is unclean.  She thinks there is nothing wrong with this type of people and in fact several of her classmates are of this nature and she associates with them.  I know my sister is not of this nature but living in Canada and especially watching television has corrupted her head. Because the kaafir's television tells us that this alright and all people should be excepted and welcomed, when this is notthe case or truth.Obviously by my question you can see my sister does not know a lot about Islam, What can I so? I'm generating my question around the fact that I live only with my mother and she said it was extremely difficult for her to take us to Quran when we came to the country and this might have saved us alot of turmoil. ( my mother and father are divorced and he lives very far away)",,,"Praise be to Allah.Praise be to Allaah Who has shown you the path of guidance; this is a great blessing which you must strive to maintain and give thanks to Allaah for that.
With regard to the issue of your sister, it is important that you strive to call her to Islam and to influence her. Allaah commanded His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to start his call to Islam with his own tribe, as He said (interpretation of the meaning):
“And warn your tribe (O Muhammad) of near kindred”
[al-Shu’araa’ 26:214]
What you need to pay attention to here is the following: 
1-Pay attention to making du’aa’ for her, because du’aa’ has an effect by Allaah’s leave. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) prayed that some of those whom he was calling to Islam would be guided.
2-Be patient and don’t give up; what is not achieved today may be achieved tomorrow.
3-Use a variety of ways and means (of calling her).
4-Strive to choose appropriate times for da’wah, when your sister is more inclined to listen and respond.
5-Use some indirect methods, such as giving her some moving Islamic books or audio or video tapes, or leave some of them lying around in the house where she can find and use them.
6-Perhaps being related and being together for so long is an obstacle to her responding, so it may be a good idea to look for a religious friend of hers who likes her, and ask her to advise her and try to influence her. 
Shaykh Muhammad al-Duwaysh 
We ask Allaah to guide your sister, and we advise you to give your sister the answer to Question no. 9465, on the ruling on forming friendships between the sexes, so that she can read it. See also the ruling on homosexuals in Islam, as given in Questions nos. 2104 and 6285.
This calamity which you are living through is a warning to you and to others of the dangers of living in the land of the kuffaar, and it is a motivation for Muslim men and women to return as quickly as possible to the lands of the Muslims.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

      The majority of scholars stated that prayer behind a faasiq (rebellious

11413,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11413,Islamic rights,What are the most important rights that are respected in Islam?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Islamic rights are many, among the most important 
          of which are the following:  
The rights of Allaah  
The blessings of Allaah to His slaves are 
          innumerable. Every blessing deserves thanks. The rights of Allaah upon 
          His slaves are many, the most important of which include the following:  
          
1.Tawheed, which means believing that Allaah is One in His 
          Essence, His names, His attributes and His deeds. So we should believe 
          that Allaah alone is the Lord, the Sovereign, the Controller, the Creator, 
          the Provider, in Whose hand is Dominion and He is Able to do all things: 
          
“Blessed be He in Whose Hand is the 
          dominion; and He is Able to do all things”[al-Mulk 67:1 – interpretation 
          of the meaning] 
2.‘Ibaadah (worship), which means worshipping Allaah alone because 
          He is their Lord, Creator and Provider. So all kinds of worship should 
          be devoted to Him alone, such as du’aa’ (supplication), dhikr (remembering 
          Allaah), seeking help, humbling oneself, submitting, hope and fear, 
          vows, sacrifices, and so on. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Worship Allaah and join none with 
          Him (in worship)” 
[al-Nisaa’ 4:36] 
3.Shukr (gratitude, giving thanks), for Allaah is the One 
          Who bestows favours and blessings upon all of creation, so they have 
          to show their gratitude for these blessings on their lips and in their 
          hearts and in their physical actions, by praising Allaah and using these 
          blessings to obey Allaah and in ways that Allaah has permitted: 
“Therefore remember Me (by praying, 
          glorifying). I will remember you, and be grateful to Me (for My countless 
          Favours on you) and never be ungrateful to Me 
[al-Baqarah 
          2:152 – interpretation of the meaning]  
The rights of the Messenger  
The sending of the Messenger  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is a great blessing for 
          all of mankind. Allah sent him to bring mankind forth from darkness 
          into light, and to show them that which will bring them happiness in 
          this world and in the Hereafter.  
Among the rights that the Messenger has over 
          us are that we should love him, obey him and send blessings upon him. 
          Loving him  (peace and blessings 
          of Allaah be upon him) is achieved by obeying his commands and believing 
          what he told us, avoiding that which he forbade and not worshipping 
          Allaah except in the ways that he prescribed.  
Parent’s rights  
Islam pays special attention to the family 
          and encourages love and respect within it. The parents are the basis 
          and foundation of the family, hence honouring one's parents is one of 
          the best deeds and one of the most beloved actions to Allaah.  
          
Honouring one’s parents is achieved by obeying 
          them, respecting them, being humble towards them, treating them kindly, 
          spending on them, praying for them, upholding ties of kinship with those 
          to whom one is related through them, and honouring their friends:  
          
“And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but 
          Him. And that you be dutiful to your parents”[al-Israa’ 17:23]  
          
The rights of the mother in this regard 
          are greater, because she is the one who bears the child, gives birth 
          to him and breastfeeds him. A man came to the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said, “O Messenger of 
          Allaah, who is most deserving of my good companionship?” He said, “Your 
          mother.” He said, “Then who?” He said, “Your mother.” He said, “Then 
          who?” He said, “Your mother.” He said, “Then who?” He said, “Your father.”
(Agreed upon. This version was narrated by al-Bukhaari, 
          al-Adab, 78)  
The rights of one Muslim over another  
The believers are brothers and are an integrated 
          nation, like a building parts of which support other parts. They treat 
          one another with mercy and compassion, and love one another. In order 
          to preserve this building and this brotherhood, Allaah has prescribed 
          rights which each Muslim has over his fellow Muslim. These include love, 
          sincerity (naseehah), relieving his distress, concealing his 
          mistakes, supporting him when he is in the right, respecting neighbours 
          and honouring guests.  
These rights also include returning greetings 
          of salaam, visiting the sick, accepting invitations, saying “yarhamuk 
          Allaah (may Allaah have mercy on you) to a Muslim when he sneezes, 
          and attending his funeral. The Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The rights of one 
          Muslim over another are five: returning the greeting of salaam, saying 
          ‘yarhamuk Allaah (may Allaah have mercy on you)’ when he sneezes, 
          accepting invitations, visiting the sick and attending funerals.” (Narrated 
          by Muslim, 2625) 
 Neighbour’s rights  
Islam pays attention to the issue of neighbours, 
          whether they are Muslim or not, because of the interests served by that 
          in making the nation like one body. The Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Jibreel kept on enjoining 
          the good treatment of neighbours to the extent that I thought that he 
          would include neighbours as heirs.” (Agreed upon. Narrated by Muslim, 
          2625)  
Among the rights of one neighbour over 
          another as affirmed by Islam are the initiation of greetings, visiting 
          him if he is sick, offering condolences if calamity befalls him, congratulating 
          him at times of joy, overlooking his mistakes, concealing his faults, 
          bearing his annoyance with patience, giving him gifts, lending him money 
          if he needs it, lowering one’s gaze from looking at his womenfolk, and 
          guiding him to that which will benefit him in his religious and worldly 
          affairs. The Prophet  (peace and 
          blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
“The best of companions with Allaah is the one who is 
          best to his companion, and the best of neighbours with Him is the one 
          who is best to his neighbour.”(Narrated by al-Bukhaari in al-Adab 
          al-Mufrad, 115)  
Concerning neighbours’ rights, Allaah says 
          (interpretation of the meaning):  
“Worship Allaah and join none with Him (in worship); 
          and do good to parents, kinsfolk, orphans, Al-Masaakeen (the poor), 
          the neighbour who is near of kin, the neighbour who is a stranger, the 
          companion by your side…”[al-Nisaa’ 4:36]  
Islam warns against annoying one’s neighbours 
          or treating them badly. The Messenger  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) explained that this would 
          lead to being deprived of Paradise: “He will not enter Paradise from 
          whose harm his neighbour is not safe.” (Agreed upon. Narrated by Muslim, 
          64).  
In order to achieve the common interest, Islam gives 
          rights to the ruler over his subjects and to the subjects over their 
          ruler, and its gives the husband rights over his wife and the wife rights 
          over her husband, and there are other just rights which Islam has enjoined.","From Usool al-Deen al-Islami, by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem al-Tuwayjri"

This is the soundest version of the wording of the Tashahhud according to the scholars. This should be said in the first Tashahhud, and in the second Tashahhud there should be added to it al-Salaah ‘ala’n-Nabi (sending blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)). Ibn al-Qayyim said: “It is prescribed for his ummah to send blessings upon him in the last Tashahhud.” (al-Salaah wa Hukm Taarikihaa, 1/284) 
2 – The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
“Say: ‘Allaahumma salli ‘ala Muhammadin wa ‘ala aali Muhammadin kamaa salayta ‘ala aali Ibraaheem, wa baarik ‘ala Muhammadin wa ‘ala aali Muhammadin kamaa baarakta ‘ala aali Ibraaheem fi’l-‘aalameen innaka Hameedun Majeed (O Allaah, send prayer upon Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad, as You sent prayers upon the family of Ibraaheem.

I also know someone who has threatened to divorce his wife if she produces a daughter. I hope that you can shed some light on this topic from the point of view of Islamic sharee’ah.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Undoubtedly this action is one of the deeds of the first Jaahiliyyah, from the conduct of its ill-mannered people, those who were blamed and condemned in the Qur’aan and Sunnah.
How similar things are today to those times. If you visit any maternity hospital in a Muslim country, and look around at the faces of those to whom daughters have been born, listening to what they say and seeing how they are, you will see a strange similarity between many of these people and the people of the Jaahiliyyah, of whom Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And when the news of (the birth of) a female (child) is brought to any of them, his face becomes dark, and he is filled with inward grief!
He hides himself from the people because of the evil of that whereof he has been informed. Shall he keep her with dishonour or bury her in the earth? Certainly, evil is their decision!”
[al-Nahl 16:58-59]
One of the manifestations of this dislike of daughters is that in some hospitals, when they find out whether the foetus is male of female by doing an ultrasound scan, if it is male they tell the family, and if it is female they say nothing. This is a very serious matter from which stem a number of haraam things, including the following:
-It implies objecting to the decree of Allaah.
-It is a rejection of the gift which Allaah has given, instead of thanking Him for it. This is sufficient to earn Allaah’s anger and expose one to punishment.
-It involves humiliating the woman and putting her down, and putting unbearable pressure on her.
-It is an indication of foolishness, ignorance, stupidity and a lack of reason.
-It implies resemblance to the people of the Jaahiliyyah.
The Muslim should avoid such behaviour, and save himself from such destructive thinking. Submitting to the decree of Allaah is obligatory, and accepting it is one of the attributes of the believers.
Moreover, the virtue of girls is not unknown, for they are our mothers and sisters, and wives. They are one half of society which gives birth to the other half, so it is as if they are the entire society. See Tuhfat al-Mawlood fi Ahkaam al-Mawlood by Ibn al-Qayyim, p. 16.
Another indication of their virtue is the fact that Allaah calls their coming a gift (something which is bestowed), and mentions them before the males in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):
“He bestows female (offspring) upon whom He wills, and bestows male (offspring) upon whom He wills” [al-Shooraa 42:49]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) also explained their virtue and urged kind treatment of them, as he said: “Whoever is tested by means of these girls, and he treats them with kindness, they will be a protection for him from the Fire.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1418, with al-Fath; Muslim, 2729).","al-Eemaan bi’l-Qadaa’ wa’l-Qadar by Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem al-Hamad, p. 160"

He is elder than me by 18 years difference. However, he misses a few prayers, due to work, and listen to music. Is it allowable for me to pray behind him. Or do I have the right to request that I should lead, if we want to pray together?",,,"Praise be to Allah.In 
          the case of the obligatory prayer, it is obligatory for you to offer 
          it in the mosque in congregation, if the mosque is nearby. So you should 
          respond to the muezzin when he says “Come to prayer,” and head for the 
          house of Allaah. With regard to praying behind an evildoer, the most 
          correct view is that it is valid to pray behind him even though he appears 
          to be an evildoer. The evidence for that is as follows:  
1 
          – The general applicability of the hadeeth of the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “The people should be led 
          in prayer by the one who is most versed in the Book of Allaah…” (Saheeh 
          Muslim, al-Masaajid wa Mawaa’id al-Salaah, 673) 
2 – The Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) 
          used to pray behind al-Hajjaaj, and al-Hajjaaj was known to be an evildoer.
3 
          – From a logical point of view, everyone whose prayer is valid is acceptable 
          as a imaam to lead the prayers. There is no evidence to suggest differentiating 
          between the validity of a person’s prayer and the validity of a person’s 
          leading the prayer.
al-Sharh 
          al-Mumti’ 
          by Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 4/307
There 
          is another view: some of the fuqahaa’ say that prayer offered behind 
          an evildoer is not valid, but those who say this do not have any sound 
          evidence to support this view.
No 
          doubt it is better for you to lead the prayer instead of your brother, 
          especially if you meet the conditions for being better qualified to 
          lead the prayer as specified in the hadeeth: “The people should be led 
          in prayer by the one who is most versed in the Book of Allaah. If they 
          are equally versed in the Qur’aan, then by the one who has most knowledge 
          of the Sunnah. If they are equal in knowledge of the Sunnah, then by 
          the one who migrated first …” (Narrated by Muslim). The same applies 
          if you are righteous, for the prayer of the righteous is more perfect, 
          more focused and more in accordance with the Sunnah.
The 
          Standing Committee was asked about a man who was haafiz (i.e., 
          he had memorized the entire Qur’aan) but he did not have a beard, and 
          another who had memorized less Qur’aan but he had a beard. They replied 
          that the one who had a beard, even though he had memorized less Qur’aan, 
          should be given priority over the one who shaved his beard, even though 
          he had memorized the whole Qur’aan.

What does Islam say about caring for animals?","Praise be to Allah.Do animals go to Jannah?
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And when the wild beasts shall be gathered together.” [al-Takwir 81:5] 
“There is not a moving (living) creature on earth, nor a bird that flies with its two wings, but are communities like you. We have neglected nothing in the Book, then unto their Lord they (all) shall be gathered.” [al-An'am 6:38] 
Ibn 'Abbas said: “Everything will be gathered , even the flies.” 
On the Day of Resurrection, the animals will settle scores between one another . It says in a hadith of Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “All scores will be settled on the Day of Resurrection; even the hornless sheep will settle its scores with the horned sheep.” (Narrated by Muslim, al-Birr wa’l-Silah wa’l-Adab, 4679)
It says in another hadith: “Allah will judge between His creation, jinn, humans and animals. On that Day the score will be settled between the hornless and the horned, until there are no outstanding issues left, then Allah will say, ‘Be dust!’ At that point the kafir will say, ‘Would that I were dust!’” Shaykh al-Albani said: (This is sahih. No. 1966; see al-Silsilah al-Sahihah, part 4, p. 966)
What does Islam say about caring for animals?
What is obligatory for the Muslim is to be kind to animals and not harm or annoy them. It was reported that a woman was punished because of a cat. Al-Bukhari narrated from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “A woman went to Hell because of a cat which she tied up, and did not feed it or let it eat of the vermin of the earth.” (Bad al-Khalq, 3071) 
And Allah forgave a prostitute because she was kind to a dog. Al-Bukhari also narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Whilst a dog was walking around a well, almost dying of thirst, one of the prostitutes of Bani Israil saw him, took off her shoe and gave him water. She was forgiven because of that.” (Ahadith al-Anbiya, 3208)

Now we argue alot and I don't know how to be the ""wife"" that I am supposed to be Islamically. I am still in the learning process, but that is were I have my biggest problem.How can I change that or try to make the problem better.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
We praise Allaah for guiding you to Islam, which is the greatest blessing that Allaah can bestow upon His slaves. 
We would like to tell you that Allaah has given you rights over your husband, and has enjoined upon you duties towards him. You can read question no. 10680 to find out more about this. 
You have to do the duties towards your husband which Allaah has enjoined upon you. Islam regards the husband’s rights as great because of the husband’s great importance in building the Muslim household, and because Allaah has enjoined him (the husband) to look after his family’s interests and take care of them.  
The Muslim woman should be wise in her dealings with her husband, because man – usually – is pleased with kind words and appreciates kind treatment.  So if that comes from his life-partner, that will have a greater effect. The wise woman must also keep away from all kinds of behaviour that will offend her husband, and rid herself of every kind of action that annoys him, and try not to control him. The man has the role of qawwaam (protector and maintainer), and the responsibility is his. Making him feel that he is falling short in certain situations may make him angry and not treat his wife well. One of them said: “The best wife is the one who knows how to create harmony in her marriage and strikes a balance between obeying and respecting her husband and expressing her own strong personality.”  
Your speaking to people on his behalf – because he does not speak your people’s language well – is permissible according to sharee’ah, but as stated above, you have to be wise in doing this. When doing these things you should not make him feel that he is lacking or that he is not important. Rather you should refer to him when speaking to the people, and consult with him, and do not make decisions in his presence without asking his permission. You should do that in front of the people to whom you are speaking so that he will feel that he is important. Try to make him feel that he speaks his own language better than you do, and that you complement one another; and you can help him to learn your language, and he can help you to learn his language. 
This is what we advise you to do, and this is what may reduce his anger and stop him from behaving in this manner. It seems that it is only a matter of time, and you have to be careful in handling this situation until he becomes more fluent in your language and is able to do things himself, on his own. 
Secondly: 
In order to become a good wife, you have to learn what Allaah has enjoined upon you, so that you can do it. You have to know how righteous women behave, their attitude and the way they interact with their husbands. You will need to strive hard until you get used to it, but it is not impossible. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Knowledge comes by learning, and patience comes by trying to be patient. Whoever seeks goodness will be given it, and whoever fears evil will be protected from it.” Narrated by al-Daaraqutni in al-Afraad; this is a hasan hadeet, as was stated by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 2328.   
Some of these characteristics and attitudes are those of which a wise mother  advised her daughter before marriage, which is comprehensive advice. We ask Allaah to help you to achieve this. That mother said to her daughter: 
“O my daughter, you are leaving your house in which you grew up, and going to live with a man whom you do not know, a companion whom you are unfamiliar with. Be like a slave woman to him and he will be like a slave to you. Remember ten characteristics which will be a stored treasure for you: 
The first and second are to be devoted to him and be content, listen to him and obey. 
The third and the fourth are to consider his nose and eyes; do not let him see anything ugly of you, or let him smell anything but a good fragrance. 
The fifth and the sixth are consider the time of his sleeping and eating, for hunger burns and disturbance of sleep causes anger. 
The seventh and the eighth are to look after his wealth and to take care of his family and his dependents. 
The ninth and the tenth are to look after his wealth and take care of his dependents.” 
Thirdly: 
The husband has to fear Allaah his Lord, and not transgress the rights of his wife. He should give her her rights as Allaah has enjoined upon him. He should realize that people vary, and that what he knows, many people are ignorant of, and what he is ignorant of, many people know.  For him to have a wife who will translate for him and show him what will benefit him and how things are done is better for him than having someone with him whom he cannot trust. Knowledge can only be acquired by learning, and the way to learn is by striving and working hard. 
Advise him to try to control himself at times of anger, and not to get angry unless you have transgressed one of the sacred limits of Allaah. This is the kind of anger that is regarded as praiseworthy.

I thought we were already married but I found out that we did not do it right.I need to know .",,,"Praise be to Allah.For information on the steps involved in a correct marriage contract, please see Question no. 2127. 
With regard to having a wedding party in the Islamic manner, you have to keep away from the things which are forbidden in sharee’ah but which many people do not pay attention to during celebrations, such as the following: 
With regard to the woman: going to a male, non-mahram hairdresser to have her hair done; or adorning herself in ways that are haraam, such as thinning the eyebrows by plucking them, or wearing tattoos, or wearing hair extensions, or other kinds of haraam things, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed the one who plucks eyebrows and the one who has that done, the one who adds hair extensions and the one who asks to have that done; imitating the kuffaar in their dress, because usually the wedding dress shows many of the woman's charms and her body, in such a way that the dress is very revealing - we seek refuge with Allaah – and also a great deal of money is wasted on the dress. 
Among the haraam actions that have to do with the man are: shaving his beard for the wedding night, which is done on the grounds that this makes him look more handsome, but this is something which is haraam according to sharee’ah; letting one's clothes hang below the ankle (isbaal). 
There follows a list of haraam things which both men and women should avoid in the wedding party: 
1- Mixing of men with women, and things that are involved in that, such as greeting and shaking hands with one another, and men and women dancing together, because all of that is haraam and is a very serious matter.
2- Taking pictures, whether men do that amongst themselves or women do that amongst themselves.
3- Drinking alcohol or eating pork.
4- Letting the husband come in to where the women are in order to take his wife.
5- Women wearing revealing, tight or short clothes amongst themselves, because this is haraam – so how about wearing such things in front of men?
6- People should avoid spending extravagantly or going to extremes in showing off in wedding parties, because that may wipe out the blessing.
7- The husband and wife exchanging rings and thus imitating the kuffaar, thinking that this will increase the husband’s love for his wife and vice versa. 
Finally, both partners should know that the more the teachings of Islam are followed in the wedding party, the more blessed their marriage will be, the more love and harmony there will be between them, and the less problems they will encounter in their married life. For if the married life is based from the outset on haraam things which go against the commands of Allaah, how can they expect the marriage to be successful after that? There have been many marriages in which there were things that went against the commands of Allaah, and they did not last. Fear Allaah with regard to this party and keep it free of things that are forbidden in Islam. May Allaah bless you both. We ask Allaah to give you and your husband strength. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.

11448,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11448,Ruling      on a man doing ghusl for his mother,Is it permissible for a man to do ghusl for his [deceased] mother?,,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for a man to do ghusl for his mother, or for a mother to do ghusl for her son. Similarly, it is not permissible for a man to do ghusl for his daughter. A man cannot do ghusl for a woman, even if she is one of his mahrams. (The only exception is that) a wife is permitted to do ghusl for her husband, and a husband is permitted to do ghusl for his wife. Apart from that, a man may only be washed by other men, and a woman may only be washed by other women.
If a male did not reach the age of seven, then it is permissible for a woman to wash him, and if a girl did not reach the age of seven, it is permissible for a man to wash her. But if the boy or girl was over the age of seven, then men should do ghusl for the boy and women should do ghusl for the girl. The point is that men are not allowed to do ghusl for women and women are not allowed to do ghusl for men, except in the case of husband and wife.

11449,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11449,He is suffering from serious waswas,"For some months I have been having a problem with waswas in both my prayers and when performing wudu (ablution). I keep forgetting what I have washed in my wudu and keep forgetting how many raka’ah I have prayed. It has reached a point where I am making sajdah as - sahu (prostration for forgetfulness in prayer) for every single prayer because my mind always strays. The more I concentrate on my prayer, the more it occurs. Sometimes I think I must have prayed 6 or 7 raka’ahs (units of prayer) for a four raka’ah prayer because I simply cannot recall how much I have prayed and so I continue until I am certain. The more I do this, the worse the problem gets. I want to ignore the waswas, but I am not sure if this is sanctioned by the sharee’ah (Islamic law). I feel it is the only way to rid myself of this disease. I read surah al-Baqarah and many du’as (supplications) related to the whisperings of shaytan and surahs al-Falaq and al-Nas. With regards to wudhu (ablution) I have a combination of problems as I feel that I have not washed properly after using the bathroom or if my clothes get wet that there is something impure on my clothes. When making wudu, I feel like I have not washed properly. I try to ignore these whisperings but I am terrified that if I ignore it and I am wrong, that my prayers will not be answered. I have reached a point where my prayers can take up to an hour or more to perform and have become merely a ritual without any khushoo’ (focus) because of these problems. I finish one prayer and start fearing how I am going to manage to get through the next one. I feel I am trapped because there is no way I can miss a prayer as I know this is exactly what shaytan wants me to do. Please help me, may Allah reward you.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
	
	Our advice to you, first of all, is to consult a psychologist; and try to 
	find a Muslim doctor so that he will understand your problem. Secondly, you 
	have to always take the easier option, and do not think about the sin or 
	punishment. If you do not follow this advice, your problem will continue. In 
	a prayer when you are not sure whether you have prayed three or four rak’ahs, 
	you have to assume that it is four, and the part of the body which you are 
	unsure whether you have washed, you have to assume that you have washed it. 
	This applies to every situation you face: take the easier option. If you do 
	that you will have defeated the Shaytan who has subjected you to this 
	involuntary/compulsive waswas.

He has to avoid the things that incur the wrath of Allaah, and say only that which is best. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And say to My slaves (i.e. the true believers of Islamic Monotheism) that they should (only) say those words that are the best. (Because) Shaytaan (Satan) verily, sows a state of conflict and disagreements among them. Surely, Shaytaan (Satan) is to man a plain enemy”
[al-Isra’ 17:53]
The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The believer does not slander, curse, or speak in an obscene or foul manner.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1977, from the hadeeth of ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood. Classed as saheeh by Ibn Hibaan, 1/421; al-Haakim, 1/57; al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 5381. 
It was narrated that Abu’l-Darda’ (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Allaah hates the obscene, foul-mouthed person.” Narrated and classed as saheeh by al-Tirmidhi, 2002. 
Al-San’aani said: 
This hadeeth tells us that swearing and cursing are not characteristics of the true believer, but an exception is made in the case of cursing kaafirs, drinkers of alcohol and those whom Allaah and His Messenger cursed. 
Subul al-Salaam, 4/198. 
So the believer has to develop the attitude described in the Qur’aan, and the attitude exemplified by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), especially towards his family. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “The best of you is the one who is best to his family.” 
Al-Shawkaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
Here we are told that the best of the people are those who are best towards their families because the family are the ones who most deserve to cheerfulness, good attitude and kindness; benefits should be brought to them and harm warded off from them. If a man is like that then he is the best of people, but if he is the opposite then he is the worst type. People often make this mistake, so you see a man who, when he meets his family he treats them in the worst and most unkind manner, and when he meets strangers who are not part of his family, he is gentle and polite and kind to them. Undoubtedly a person who is like that is deprived of divine support and is going astray from the straight path. We ask Allaah to keep us safe and sound.  
Nayl al-Awtaar, 6/360. 
The group with whom your father is going out is well known for having and promoting good characteristics, so the basic principle is that he is like that too, and that he fears Allaah. We say to you – if what you say about your father is true – that this is a test, and you have to be patient and pray that Allaah will guide him to the best of attitudes and characteristics. 
Patience undoubtedly brings a great reward. His wife must also be patient and put up with her husband’s annoyance, and obey him with regard to that which Allaah has permitted. If he is forbidding her to visit her relatives for a legitimate shar’i reason, then he has the right to do that, but if there is no legitimate reason then she has to obey him, but he is sinning, and the wife will be rewarded in sha Allaah.

Are barakat lost to those who follow,though they move correctly.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is permissible for the imam to lead the people in prayer in the manner mentioned in the question, and it is permissible for him to lead the people in prayer whilst sitting down. This is the view of Abu Haneefah, al-Shaafa’i and Ahmad. 
How the worshippers behind him should pray depends on the situation: 
1 – If the imam starts praying sitting down, then the people behind him should pray sitting down. 
The evidence for this is as follows: 
(i)It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah the Mother of the Believers said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) prayed at home when he was sick. He prayed sitting down and some people prayed behind him standing up, but he gestured to them that they should sit. When he finished (the prayer) he said, ‘The imam has been appointed to be followed. When he bows, bow; when he raises his head, raise your heads; and if he prays sitting, then pray sitting.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, al-Adhaan, 657)
(ii)It was narrated from Anas ibn Maalik that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) rode a horse and fell, and the right side (of his body) was injured. He offered one of the prayers sitting down, and we prayed behind him sitting down.  When he finished (the prayer) he said, ‘The imam has been appointed to be followed. If he prays standing up, then pray standing up; when he bows, bow; when he raises his head, raise your heads. When he says Sami’ Allaahu liman hamidah (Allaah hears the one who praises Him), say Rabbanaa wa laka’l-hamd (Our Lord, to You be praise). If he prays standing, then pray standing, and if he prays sitting, then pray sitting, all of you.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, al-Adhaan, 648).
2 – If the imam starts the prayer standing, then something happens to him that makes him unable to stand any more, those who are praying behind him should complete the prayer standing. 
The evidence for this is as follows: 
(i)It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) became seriously ill and asked, ‘Have the people prayed?’ We replied, ‘No, they are waiting for you.’ He said, ‘Put some water in a tub for me.’ We did that and he took a bath and tried to get up, but he fainted. Then he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) recovered, and again asked, ‘Have the people prayed?’ We said, ‘No, they are waiting for you, O Messenger of Allaah.’ He again said, ‘Put some water in a tub for me.’ He sat down and took a bath and tried to get up but fainted again. Then he recovered and said, ‘Have the people prayed?’ We said, ‘No, they are waiting for you, O Messenger of Allaah.’ He again said, ‘Put some water in a tub for me.’ He sat down and took a bath and tried to get up but fainted again. Then he recovered and said, ‘Have the people prayed?’ We said, ‘No, they are waiting for you, O Messenger of Allaah.’ The people were in the mosque, waiting for the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to lead them in ‘Isha prayer. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sent word to Abu Bakr that he should lead the people in prayer. The messenger went to him and said, ‘The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is telling you to lead the people in prayer.’ Abu Bakr, who was a soft-hearted man, said: ‘O ‘Umar, lead the people in prayer.’ But ‘Umar answered, you have more right to do that.’ So Abu Bakr led the prayers during those days. Then when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) felt a little better, he came out supported by two men, one of whom was al-‘Abbaas, for the Zuhr prayer. Abu Bakr was leading the people in prayer, but when Abu Bakr saw him, he wanted to step back [to let the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) lead the prayer]. But the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) gestured to him that he should not step back. He said, ‘Sit me down beside him,’ so they sat him down beside Abu Bakr. Abu Bakr continued praying, but he followed the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in prayer, and the people were following Abu Bakr in the prayer, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was sitting down.” (narrated by al-Bukhaari, al-Adhaan, 655).
The relevant point in this hadeeth is that Abu Bakr started to lead them in prayer standing up, then the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came and led them from where Abu Bakr had reached, and he prayed sitting down, and the Sahaabah prayed behind him standing up. This indicates that if the imam starts the prayer standing, then he becomes unable to carry on standing, then the people praying behind him should still pray standing. 
This does not mean that the prayer is lacking and it does not detract from its blessing, in sha Allaah. And Allaah knows best.

          Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “Mu’aadh  led his 
          companions in praying ‘isha’ and he made it lengthy. The Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Do you want to be 
          a cause of fitnah? When you lead the people in prayer, recite Wa’l-shamsi wa duhaahaa (al-Shams 91), Sabbih 
          isma rabbik al-A’laa (al-A’laa 87), Iqraa’ 
          bismi Rabbik (al-‘Alaq 96), and Wa’l-layli

          narrated by Muslim). 
 Al-Haafiz 
          said: Whoever follows the way of the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) by being brief and complete, 
          no one will complain that he is taking too long. The description of 
          the prayer of the Prophet  (peace 
          and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is well-known. Therefore the briefness 
          in prayer which is enjoined is something which is relative, and must 
          be measured against what the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did, persisted in and enjoined 
          upon others, not the desires of the members of the congregation. It 
          was narrated in al-Saheehayn 
          that Anas said: “I never prayed behind anyone who made the prayer more 
          brief and more perfect than the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).” 
 He 
          said in al-Mubdi’: They 
          evaluated the prayer of the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his sujood lasted the 
          length of time it takes to say Subhaan 
          rabbi al-A’laa ten times. His rukoo’ was of a similar length. 
          And he [the Prophet  (peace and 
          blessings of Allaah be upon him)] said: “pray as you have seen me praying.” 
          
 Shaykh 
          al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah] said: he (the imaam) does not have the right 
          to make the prayer longer than what is prescribed. He should usually 
          do what the Prophet  (peace and 
          blessings of Allaah be upon him) usually did, and make it longer or 
          shorter according to the circumstances, just as the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did. 
 Ibn 
          ‘Abd al-Barr said: For imaams to keep the prayer brief is a matter on 
          which there is scholarly consensus that it is mustahabb, as long as 
          he meets the condition of making it complete. 
 The 
          hadeeth of Jaabir quoted above indicates that reciting the soorahs mentioned 
          or similar soorahs is what is considered to be moderate in prayer. What 
          is prescribed is for the rukoo’ and sujood to be of similar length to 
          the recitation.

Conditions of wudu


Difference between men and women in wudu


What to say after wudu?


Can we say “may Allah have mercy on the Prophet”?","Praise be to Allah.Congratulations on your conversion to Islam 
We praise Allah for having guided you and opened your heart. We ask Allah to make us and you steadfast in obeying Him. We appreciate your efforts to learn about your religion and we advise you to strive to acquire knowledge so that your worship will be correct. Try to learn Arabic so that you will be able to read Quran and understand it properly. We ask Allah to bless you with beneficial knowledge. 
How to Make Wudu
With regard to how wudu is to be done, there are two ways; the complete and the acceptable way. Find the details below.
1 – Obligatory parts of wudu, which are as follows: 
1.      Washing the face completely once, which includes rinsing the mouth and nose.
2.      Washing the arms up to the elbows , once.
3.      Wiping the entire head , including the ears.
4.      Washing the feet up to the ankles, once .
What is meant by once in all the above is that the entire part of the body mentioned must be washed thoroughly.
1.      This must be done in order, so one washes the face first, then the arms, then wipes the head, then washes the feet, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did wudu in this order.
2.      This must be done continuously, i.e., the parts of the body must be washed one after the other with no lengthy interruption between washing one part and the next.
These are the obligatory parts of wudu which must be done in order for wudu to be sound. 
The evidence for these obligatory parts of wudu is the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! When you intend to offer As-Salah (the prayer), wash your faces and your hands (forearms) up to the elbows, rub (by passing wet hands over) your heads, and (wash) your feet up to the ankles. If you are in a state of Janabah (i.e. after a sexual discharge), purify yourselves (bathe your whole body). But if you are ill or on a journey, or any of you comes after answering the call of nature, or you have been in contact with women (i.e. sexual intercourse), and you find no water, then perform Tayammum with clean earth and rub therewith your faces and hands. Allah does not want to place you in difficulty, but He wants to purify you, and to complete His Favour to you that you may be thankful” [al-Maidah 5:6]
2 – Mustahabb parts of wudu. These were narrated in the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), the details of which are as follows: 
1.      You must have the intention of purifying yourself and removing impurity. The intention should not be spoken out loud for its place is in the heart. This applies to all acts of worship.
2.      You should say Bismillah .
3.      Then you should wash your hands three times
4.      Then you should rinse your mouth three times, swirling the water around inside your mouth, and rinse your nose three times, blowing the water out and using the left hand to remove the water from your nose.
5.      You should wash your face three times, from the hairline to the jawbone and chin, and from ear to ear. A man should wash the hair of his beard because it is part of the face. If his beard is thin he has to wash it inside and out, and if it is thick and covers the skin, he should wash the surface of it only and run his wet fingers through it.
6.      Then he should wash his arms up to the elbows three times. The arm extends from the fingertips, including the nails, to the lower part of the upper arm. It is essential to remove anything stuck to the hands before washing them, such as dough, mud, paint, etc, that could prevent the water from reaching the skin.
7.      Then after that he should wipe his head and ears once with fresh water, not the water left over from washing his arms. The way in which the head is to be wiped is that you put your wet hands at the front of your head and bring them to the back of your head, then bring them back to the place where you started. Then put your index fingers in your ears and wipe the back of the ears with your thumbs. With regard to a woman’s hair, she should wipe it whether it is loose or braided from the front of her head to the roots of the hair at the nape of her neck, but she does not have to wipe the entire length of her hair.
8.      Then you should wash your feet three times up to the ankles, namely the bones at the bottom of the leg.
The evidence for that is the hadith narrated by Humran the freed slave of ‘Uthman, who said that ‘Uthman ibn ‘Affan (may Allah be pleased with him) called for water to do wudu. He washed his hands three times, then he rinsed his mouth and nose, then he washed his face three times, then he washed his right arm up to the elbow three times, then he washed his left arm likewise. Then he wiped his head, then he washed his right foot up to the ankle three times, then he washed his left foot likewise. Then he said, “I saw the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) doing wudu as I have done it, then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ‘Whoever does wudu as I have done it, then prays two rak’ahs in which he focuses completely on his prayer, his previous sins will be forgiven.’” (Narrated by Muslim, al-Taharah, 331) 
Conditions of wudu
The conditions of wudu are: being Muslim, being of sound mind, having reached the age of discernment and having the intention of doing wudu. Wudu is not valid on the part of a non-Muslim, an insane person, a small child who has not yet reached the age of discernment or one who does not have the intention of doing wudu because his intention is to cool himself down, for example. 
The water must also be pure (tahir), for impure (najis) water cannot be used for wudu. One must also remove anything that could prevent water from reaching the skin and nails, such as nail polish. 
It is prescribed to say Bismillah according to the majority of scholars, but they differ as to whether it is obligatory or Sunnah. If one remembers to say it, it may be said either at the beginning of wudu or during it. 
Difference between men and women in wudu
There is no difference between men and women in the way wudu should be done. 
What to say after wudu?
It is mustahabb to say, when one has completed wudu : “Ashhadu an la ilaha ill-Allah wahdahu la sharika lah, wa ashhadu anna Muhammadan ‘abduhu wa rasuluhu (I bear witness that there is no god except Allah alone with no partner or associate, and I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah),” because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no one among you who does wudu and does it properly and does it well, then he says, ‘Ashhadu an la ilaha ill-Allah wahdahu la sharika lah, wa ashhadu anna Muhammadan ‘abduhu wa rasuluhu,’ but the gates of Paradise will be opened to him and he may enter through whichever of them he wishes.” (Narrated by Muslim, al-Taharah, 345). A report narrated by al-Tirmidhi adds: “Allahumma ij’alni min al-tawwabina wa’j’alni min al-mutatahhirin  (O Allah, make me one of those who repent and make me one of those who purify themselves).” (al-Taharah, 50; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Sunan Abi Dawud, no. 48) (See al-Mulakhkhas al-Fiqhi by al-Fawzan, 1/36) 
Can we say “may Allah have mercy on the Prophet”?
 With regard to your saying “may Allah have mercy on the Prophet”, what is prescribed in Islam is to send blessings and peace upon him, as Allah commanded us to do when He said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allah sends His Salah (Graces, Honours, Blessings, Mercy) on the Prophet (Muhammad), and also His angels (ask Allah to bless and forgive him). O you who believe! Send your Salah on (ask Allah to bless) him (Muhammad), and (you should) greet (salute) him with the Islamic way of greeting (salutation, i.e. As-Salamu ‘Alaykum)” [al-Ahzab 33:56] 
And Allah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
11498,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11498,Warding Off Thoughts of Zina,What should you do if you find yourself thinking about zina (fornication/adultery)?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Thinking about zinaa may mean one of two things.
(1)It may be merely thoughts that cross the mind, without becoming a firm resolve. A person cannot be blamed for this, but it is better to rid oneself of these thoughts so that they do not lead to anything else.
(2)It may be an established thought accompanied by resolve and intention. In this case, the person must hasten to deal with it in a number of ways, including the following:
1-Seriously thinking of getting married, because this is the shar’i (legal Islamic) and natural protection for the Muslim man and woman.
2-Fasting if one cannot get married.
3-Muslim men and women should strive to strengthen their eemaan (faith) by reading Qur’aan, praying naafil (voluntary) prayers and doing other kinds of acts of worship.
4-Taking care to choose righteous friends.
5-Keeping away from everything that might provoke desire; one of the most obvious of these is looking at things which are haram (impermissible).
6-Remembering the punishment for zinaa in this world and in the Hereafter, and that its evil affects far outweigh the immediate pleasure that a person may experience.",Shaykh Muhammad al-Duwaysh
11499,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11499,Failing to help those who are stricken by disasters on the grounds that this is the will of Allaah,"Some people see their Muslim brothers who have been stricken by calamities and disasters, and they do not move or feel motivated to help them, nor do they urge others to do that, on the grounds that what has happened is the will of Allaah and it is not right for us to help them when Allaah is punishing them!  Some people, when they are told to do good to the poor and needy, they say, how can we do good to them when Allaah has willed this for them? Allaah has made them poor and you want to make them rich? Or they say, if Allaah wanted to, He could make them rich without our help. What is the Islamic view concerning such comments?",,,"Praise be to Allah.These 
          and similar comments are undoubtedly false speech, which is indicative 
          of great ignorance or despicable negligence. The will of Allaah can 
          never be grounds for committing sin or neglecting obligatory duties. 
          
 Moreover, 
          Allaah has commanded us to help Muslims who are in dire straits and 
          to help the needy. He denounces those who fail to do this duty, as He 
          says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Nay! 
          But you treat not the orphans with kindness and generosity (i.e. you 
          neither treat them well, nor give them their exact right of inheritance)! 
          
And 
          urge not one another on the feeding of Al-Miskeen (the poor)! 
          
And 
          you devour the inheritance — all with greed. 
And 
          you love wealth with much love” 
[al-Fajr 
          89:17-20] 
 Not feeding the 
          poor is one of the causes of a person entering Hell. Allaah says (interpretation 
          of the meaning):
“ 
          ‘What has caused you to enter Hell?’ 
They 
          will say: “We were not of those who used to offer the Salaah (prayers), 
          
Nor 
          we used to feed Al-Miskeen (the poor); 
[al-Muddaththir 
          74:42-44] 
 Wealth belongs 
          to Allaah; if He willed, He could take it away from the person who says 
          these things. Would he, in that case, when he is in desperate need for 
          food, like to have said to him what he is saying to others?
 This view is 
          seriously mistaken and is a great misguidance. The one who says this 
          is like those of whom Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning);
“And when it 
          is said to them: ‘Spend of that with which Allaah has provided you,’ 
          those who disbelieve say to those who believe: ‘Shall we feed those 
          whom, if Allaah willed, He (Himself) would have fed? You are only in 
          a plain error’”
