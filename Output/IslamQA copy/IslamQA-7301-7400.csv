7327,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7327,Why Is Alcohol Haram?,Why does Islam prohibit drinking alcohol even in small amounts?  And what does the Quran say about it?,"Alcohol is haram because it is intoxicating and contains a substance that makes people lose their minds.

Why is alcohol haram?


Alcohol-based perfume: Halal?","Praise be to Allah.Is alcohol haram in Islam?
No doubt alcohol is intoxicating, and contains this substance that makes people lose their minds. It says in the hadith, “Every intoxicant is khamr, and every khamr is haram (forbidden).” 
If this is the case, then alcohol is considered to be forbidden and to come under the heading of “khamr” (wine, etc.) which people drink for relaxation or enjoyment.
Why is alcohol haram?
1- Allah has forbidden alcohol and stated that it is a sin, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):
“They ask you (O Muhammad) concerning alcoholic drink and gambling. Say: ‘In them is a great sin, and (some) benefits for men, but the sin of them is greater than their benefit’” [al-Baqarah 2:219]
If sin is present and it is great, then it is forbidden. 
2- Undoubtedly this alcohol is harmful to the mind and body, and Allah has forbidden everything that harms the body and mind, and saps the strength. Everything that is harmful to a person is not permitted, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And do not kill yourselves” [al-Nisaa’ 4:29]
“and do not throw yourselves into destruction” [al-Baqarah 2:195]
3- And because this is an extravagant waste of money, an action of the spendthrift which comes under the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning):
“Verily, the spendthrifts are brothers of the Shayateen (devils). [al-Isra 17:27]
Alcohol-based perfume: Halal?
Using alcohol in ways other than drinking it may be permitted if small amounts are used, such as mixing it with perfumes that are used on clothes or the body, because it keeps them from spoiling, and because it keeps the clothes clean. This is OK, but drinking it is not permissible under any circumstances.

7328,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7328,His wife has left Islam,"A brother came to me and Asked ""What does he do if his wife told him that she no longer desires to be a muslim.  She believes that there is a God but she does not want to be a Muslim.  She said she does not care if it takes her to the Hell-Fire.  She has stopped praying, remove the cover from her and her daughter(who is not his daughter), and said that they no longer follow Islam.""  She has also said that she wants to move. 
Shaikh, we urgently need to know what to do.  If she is guilty of ar-riddah, then how does it affect their marriage?  Are they still married?  Does she go into a state of Iddah?  Can he be alone with her?  Should he remain in the same home (she asked him to leave and she is bringing statues and other impermissible things into the home)?  It could present fitnah and weaken his eemaan because of his emotions.  
We(the members of this community) definitely would appreciate a rapid response as there may be serious implications from the matter.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Undoubtedly if this is the case, she has chosen 
          kufr over eemaan. She does not want to stay a Muslim and she is insulting 
          Islam and its symbols, and going against its teachings. In this case 
          she is a kaafir and an apostate, so it is not permissible for him to 
          stay married to her, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
          
“Likewise hold not 
          the disbelieving women as wives” 
[al-Mumtahanah 60:10] 
          
i.e., 
          if he has a kaafir wife, it is not permissible for him to stay married 
          to her. He has to advise her and establish proof against her, then leave 
          her. If he is in a place where there is an Islamic government and sharee’ah 
          law, then he has to refer her case to the Muslim qaadi, for him to ask 
          her to repent. If she does not repent then the ruling of Allaah should 
          be carried out on her, which is execution, because the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever changes his 
          religion [leaves Islam], execute him.” 
But if that is not possible and there is no 
          Islamic rule or sharee’ah law in his country, then at least he should 
          separate from her completely; it is not permissible for him to live 
          with her after she has clearly stated her kufr.",Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Jibreen
