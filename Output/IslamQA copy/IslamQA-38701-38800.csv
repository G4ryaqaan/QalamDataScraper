38701,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/38701,"Enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, and the verse, “Take care of your ownselves”","How can we refute, with strong and definitive evidence, those who quote the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “O you who believe! Take care of your ownselves” when they are enjoined to do that which is good and told not to do that which is evil?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.This verse from Soorat al-Maa'idah is one that is misunderstood by some people. They think that 
    it means that it is not obligatory to enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil, and they sometimes quote it to those who are enjoining them to 
    do something good or telling them not to do something evil. 
In his commentary on the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Take care of your ownselves. If you follow the (right) guidance [and 
    enjoin what is right (Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do) and forbid what is wrong (polytheism, disbelief and all that Islam 
    has forbidden)] no hurt can come to you from those who are in error”
[al-Maa’idah 5:105]
The scholar Muhammad al-Ameen al-Shanqeeti said: 
The ignorant person may imagine, from the apparent meaning of this verse, that it is not 
    obligatory to enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil, but the same aayah also indicates that if a person does his best (to enjoin what is 
    good and forbid what is evil), and there is no response, then this is what this verse refers to. That is where Allaah says “If you follow the 
    (right) guidance”, because whoever does not enjoin what is good is not following right guidance. Those who said this include Hudhayfah and 
    Sa’eed ibn al-Musayyib, as quoted by al-Aloosi in his Tafseer; Ibn Jareer, as quoted by al-Qurtubi from Sa’eed ibn al-Musayyib; and Abu 
    ‘Ubayd al-Qaasim ibn Salaam. Ibn Jareer also quoted something similar from a group of the Sahaabah including Ibn ‘Umar and Ibn Mas’ood. 
Some of the scholars said that “If you follow the (right) guidance” means if you tell 
    them but they do not listen; and some of them said that enjoining what is good is included in the meaning of guidance in this verse. This is very 
    clear to any fair-minded person. 
Further evidence that the one who does not enjoin what is good is not following true guidance 
    is the fact that Allaah swears that such a person is lost, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“By Al‑‘Asr (the time).
Verily, man is in loss,
Except those who believe (in Islamic Monotheism) and do righteous good deeds, and recommend 
    one another to the truth [i.e. order one another to perform all kinds of good deeds (Al‑Ma‘roof) which Allaah has ordained, and abstain from all 
    kinds of sins and evil deeds (Al‑Munkar) which Allaah has forbidden], and recommend one another to patience (for the sufferings, harms, and 
    injuries which one may encounter in Allaah’s Cause during preaching His religion of Islamic Monotheism or Jihad)”
[al-‘Asr 103:1-3]
The truth of the matter is that it is obligatory to enjoin what is good and forbid what is 
    evil, and once he has done his duty, the one who enjoins good cannot be harmed by the misguidance of those who have gone astray. This is indicated 
    by several verses such as (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And fear the Fitnah (affliction and trial) which affects not in particular (only) those of 
    you who do wrong”
[al-Anfaal 8:25]
and the ahaadeeth which indicate that if people do not enjoin what is good and forbid what is 
    evil, then Allaah will include them in His punishment. For example: 
It was narrated that Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “O people, you 
    recite this verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Take care of your ownselves. If you follow the (right) guidance [and 
    enjoin what is right (Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do) and forbid what is wrong (polytheism, disbelief and all that Islam 
    has forbidden)] no hurt can come to you from those who are in error”
[al-Maa’idah 5:105]
But I heard the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say, ‘If 
    the people see an evildoer and do not take him by the hand [to put a stop to his evil], soon Allaah will punish all of them.” Narrated by Abu 
    Dawood, 4338; al-Tirmidhi, 2168; and al-Nasaa’i – with a saheeh isnaad. Also classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, no.

38703,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/38703,Some drops come out of her and she is pregnant. Should she stop praying?,Some coffee-coloured drops came out of my wife and she does not get her period sometimes. Should she fast and pray etc. knowing that she is one and half months pregnant?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Many of the scholars are of the view that a pregnant woman cannot menstruate. This is the view of two imams: Abu Haneefah and Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on them). 
See: al-Mughni, 1/443. 
This view was also favoured by the scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas. 
Others are of the view that a pregnant woman may menstruate. This is the view of Imam Maalik and Imam al-Shaafa’i (may Allah have mercy on them). 
See: al-Majmoo’ (2/411-414) 
This view was favoured by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem and Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on them). 
This is so long as the blood meets the description of menstrual blood and comes at the normal time of menses. 
This has been explained in the answer to question no. 23400. 
Whatever the case, these drops that have come out from your wife are not menses, because they do not meet the description of menstrual blood and are not occurring at the time of menses. 
 So your wife is pure (taahir) and she may pray, fast and do all that women who are taahir do.",Islam Q&A
38724,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/38724,Her husband wants her to sit in front of the TV with him,"My husband gets annoyed at my reading Quran a lot, as he says, because I am leaving him alone. Will I be sinning if I stop reading Quran for him because he wants me to watch TV with him? If I do not read Quran and I sit with him, will I be sinning whether that is during the day or at night in Ramadan? Please note that I try to read Quran when he is sleeping or doing something that keeps him busy, and I do not read much, but I am learning tajweed [correct recitation].",,,"Praise be to Allah.There is no blame on you if you read Quran and do a lot of acts of worship, so 
    long as that does not impinge upon your husband’s rights, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “It is not 
    permissible for a woman to fast when her husband is present, except with his permission.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5195; Muslim, 1026. 
That is because the husband’s right to physical intimacy is obligatory, so it is 
    not permissible to impinge on that by doing something that is nafil (supererogatory). 
The righteous wife should be happy that her husband is interested in her and wants 
    her to sit with him. She should realize that by pleasing him and making him happy she will earn a great reward. So do your best and try to create a 
    balance, and choose times for your worship when your husband is busy or is outside. 
With regard to watching TV, it is evil and should be avoided, because it provokes 
    desires and stirs up doubts, and propagates many evils, such as mixing of men and women, uncovering ‘awrahs, and using music and musical 
    instruments. What good there may be in it is outweighed by these great evils. Many of those who tried it and have it in their homes will tell 
    you that it is difficult to control it and keep away from its evils. Because even the religious programs – which are the best of what is available 
    – are not free from the sound of musical instruments, or else they are presented by women who are clothed yet naked, astray themselves and leading 
    others astray, so how about other programs? And Allah is the One Whose help we seek. 
What your husband has to do is to fear Allah and make sure his wife and children 
    avoid seeing and hearing these evil things, for he is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Ward off yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell) 
    whose fuel is men and stones, over which are (appointed) angels stern (and) severe, who disobey not, (from executing) the Commands they receive 
    from Allah, but do that which they are commanded”
[al-Tahreem 66:6] 
And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Each of you is a 
    shepherd and each of you is responsible for his flock. The ruler is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock. A man is the shepherd of his 
    family and is responsible for his flock. A woman is the shepherd of her husband’s household and is responsible for her flock…” Narrated by 
    al-Bukhari, 893; Muslim, 1829. 
If he calls you to watch or listen to any of the haram things that we have 
    mentioned, it is not permissible for you to obey him, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no 
    obedience in disobedience to Allah; obedience is only with regard to that which is good and proper.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 7257; Muslim, 1840. 
    Be kind and gentle when you advise him, and ask Allah to set his heart straight and make him come to his senses.

Punishment of those who do not fast 


Advice for those who do not fast","Praise be to Allah.Fasting is one of the pillars of Islam
Fasting in Ramadan is one of the pillars on which Islam is built . Allah tells us that He has prescribed it for the believers of this ummah [nation], as He prescribed it for those who came before them. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Observing As-Sawm (the fasting) is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, that you may become Al-Muttaqun (the pious.” [al-Baqarah 2:183] 
“The month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Quran, a guidance for mankind and clear proofs for the guidance and the criterion (between right and wrong). So whoever of you sights (the crescent on the first night of) the month (of Ramadan i.e. is present at his home), he must observe Sawm (fasts) that month, and whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number [of days which one did not observe Sawm (fasts) must be made up] from other days. Allah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you. (He wants that you) must complete the same number (of days), and that you must magnify Allah [i.e. to say Takbir (Allahu Akbar: Allah is the Most Great)] for having guided you so that you may be grateful to Him.”[al-Baqarah 2:185]
Al-Bukhari (8) and Muslim (16) narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Islam is built on five (pillars): the testimony that there is no god but Allah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; establishing prayer; paying zakah; Hajj; and fasting Ramadan.” 
Is t haram to break your fast?
Whoever does not fast has abandoned one of the pillars of Islam, and is committing a grave major sin. Indeed some of the salaf were of the view that he is a disbeliever and apostate – we seek refuge with Allah from that. 
Abu Ya’la narrated in his Musnad from Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The bonds of Islam and the bases of religion are three, on which Islam was founded. Whoever gives up one of them becomes a kafir thereby and it is permissible to shed his blood (under strict conditions within an Islamic state under the orders of the ruler): the testimony that there is no god but Allah, the prescribed prayers and fasting Ramadan.” 
This hadith was classed as sahih by al-Dhahabi, and as hasan by al-Haythami in Majma’ al-Zawaid, 1/48, and by al-Mundhiri in al-Targhib wa’l-Tarhib, no. 805, 1486. Classed as da’if by al-Albani in al-Silsilah al-Da’ifah, no. 94.  
Al-Dhahabi said in al-Kabair, p. 64. 
Whoever does not fast in Ramadan without being sick or having any other excuse that allows him not to fast is more evil than the adulterer or drunkard, indeed they doubted his Islam and thought that this was heresy. 
Punishment of those who do not fast 
A sahih report which warns against not fasting was narrated by Ibn Khuzaymah (1986) and Ibn Hibban (7491) from Abu Umamah al-Bahili who said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “Whilst I was sleeping two men came to me and took me by the arm and brought me to a cragged mountain. They said, ‘Climb up.’ I said, ‘I cannot.’ They said, ‘We will make it easy for you.’ So I climbed up until I was at the top of the mountain. Then I heard loud voices. I said, ‘What are these voices?’ They said, ‘This is the howling of the people of Hell.” Then I was taken until I saw people hanging by their hamstrings, with the sides of their mouths torn and blood pouring from their mouths.’ I said, ‘Who are these?’ He said, ‘These are people who broke their fast before it was time.’” (Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Mawarid al-Zam’an, no. 1509)
Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “This is the punishment of those who fasted then broke the fast deliberately before the time for breaking the fast came, so what about those who do not fast at all? We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound in this world and in the Hereafter.” 
Advice for those who do not fast
Our advice to the brother who asked this question is to fear Allah and to beware of His wrath, vengeance and a painful punishment. He should hasten to repent to Allah before the destroyer of pleasures that splits people apart [i.e., death] takes him unaware. 
Today there is action and no reckoning, but tomorrow there will be reckoning and no action. Note that whoever repents, Allah will accept his repentance, and whoever draws closer to Allah one hand span, Allah will draw closer to him one cubit. For Allah is Most Generous, Forbearing and Most Merciful, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Know they not that Allah accepts repentance from His slaves and takes the Sadaqat (alms, charity), and that Allah Alone is the One Who forgives and accepts repentance, Most Merciful?” [al-Tawbah 9:104]
If you try fasting and find out how easy it is and what comfort it brings and how close it brings you to Allah, you will never give it up. 
Think about what Allah says at the end of the verses on fasting (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you.” [al-Baqarah 2:185]
The phrase, “so that you may be grateful to Him” shows that fasting is a blessing for which we must give thanks. Hence some of the salaf used to wish that the whole year was Ramadan. 
We ask Allah to help you and guide you, and to open your heart to that which will bring you happiness in this world and in the Hereafter.

Is that permissible?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Since using this water is not a means of healing, whether according to sharee’ah or science, then using it is a form of minor shirk, because minor shirk means using as a means something that cannot be a means. 
What this woman should do is to recite ruqyahs for herself that are prescribed in sharee’ah, such as al-Faatihah and al-Mi’wadhatayn (the last two soorahs of the Qur’aan), and there is nothing wrong with seeing doctors to treat her problem.

38750,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/38750,She sees a dry brownish-reddish spot a few days before her period,"I have a question about menstruation, which is that during the first three days I see a small dry spot which is sometimes brown and sometimes light red, and after that I see thick blood accompanied by pains for four days, then I see a light red stringy discharge for two days. 
My question is: what is the ruling on fasting and praying on the first and last days? I hope you will reply because I do not know how my acts of worship should be.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The thick blood that is accompanied by pains for four days is undoubtedly menstruation. The brown and red spots that come before the period are subject to further discussion: 
If it is followed directly by the bleeding, then it is part of your period, so it is not permissible to pray and fast at that time. 
If it is separate from the bleeding, then it is not part of your period. 
The same applies to the stringy red discharge that you see for two days. If that happens before the tuhr [end of the period], then it is part of the period; if that happens after the tuhr, then it does not matter and it comes under the same ruling as the blood of istihaadah [non-menstrual bleeding] and does not mean that you cannot fast or pray, but you should do wudoo’ at the time of each prayer. 
The tuhr or end of the period is indicated by one of two signs: either a clear discharge is emitted, or the place becomes dry, so that if it is wiped with a piece of cotton or something similar, it comes away clean with no trace of blood or yellowish or brownish discharge. 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: Before my period comes I have a brown discharge that lasts for five days, after which comes the menstrual blood. The menstrual blood lasts for eight days after the first five days. I pray on the five days but I wonder whether I should fast and pray on these days or not? Please advise me, may Allaah reward you. 
He replied: 
If the five days on which you have the brown discharge are separate from the days when you bleed, then this is not menstruation, and you have to pray on these days and can fast, but you should do wudoo’ for each prayer, because this comes under the same ruling as urine, not the rulings on menstruation. So it does not mean that you cannot pray and fast, but it does mean that you have to do wudoo’ every time, until that discharge stops, as in the case of istihaadah (non-menstrual bleeding). 
But if these five days are followed immediately by your period, then they are part of your period, so you should not fast or pray on these days. 
Similarly, if this brownish or yellowish discharge comes after your period ends, it is not be regarded as part of the period, rather it comes under the ruling on istihaadah, so you have to wash your private parts with water and do wudoo’ for each prayer, and you should pray and fast, and not regard this as menstruation. You are also permissible for your husband, because Umm ‘Atiyyah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: “We used to think that the brownish and yellowish discharge after the end of the period did not matter.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh and by Abu Dawood; this version narrated by Abu Dawood).
