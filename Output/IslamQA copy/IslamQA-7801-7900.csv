“Truly, the religion with Allaah is Islam” [Aal ‘Imraan 
          3:19] 
 “And 
          whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted 
          of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers” [Aal ‘Imraan 
          3:85] 
 The essence of Islam is submission to Allaah alone, 
          by worshipping Him alone with no partner or associate, and by obeying 
          Him and His Messenger  (peace and 
          blessings of Allaah be upon him). The basic principle of Islam is bearing 
          witness that there is no god except Allaah and that Muhammad is the 
          Messenger of Allaah. Every Muslim must practise the religion of Islam, 
          devoting his worship sincerely to Allaah and following the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Whoever adheres to that 
          until he dies will be one of the people of Paradise, but whoever does 
          not enter Islam before he dies will be among the people of Hell. Whoever 
          enters Islam then goes back (to kufr) is an apostate and a kaafir, and 
          if he dies in that state of kufr (disbelief) he will be one of the people 
          of Hell. But if he repents and comes back to Islam, and remains a Muslim 
          until he dies, his apostasy will not affect him, and he will be one 
          of the people of Paradise, even if he fell into apostasy more than once. 
          But there is the fear that this repeated leaving Islam will cause him 
          not to be guided to repentance. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
 “Verily, those 
          who believe, then disbelieve, then believe (again), and (again) disbelieve, 
          and go on increasing in disbelief; Allaah will not forgive them, nor 
          guide them on the (right) way” [al-Nisaa’ 4:137]  
So hasten to repent sincerely and adhere to Islam, fulfilling 
          the obligations that Allaah has enjoined on His slaves, the greatest 
          of which are the five daily prayers. Avoid sin, and ask your Lord to 
          make you steadfast in adhering to His  religion. If you lose enthusiasm 
          then seek the help of Allaah and seek refuge with Allaah from the Shaytaan. 
          If you find that you are experiencing insinuating whispers which are 
          causing you to doubt Islam or some of its principles, then turn away 
          from them (those whispers), and seek refuge with Allaah from the Shaytaan, 
          and say “I believe in Allaah and His Messenger.” You should recite Qur’aan, 
          and read books which will make you love Islam and encourage you to obey 
          Allaah, such as Riyaadh al-Saaliheen 
          by Imaam al-Nawawi, and the Tafseer (Qur’aanic commentary) of al-‘Allaamah 
          ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Sa’di, Tayseer 
          Kalaam al-Rahmaan fi Tasfeer Kalaam al-Mannaan. Beware of 
          books which make you doubt Islam and make sin attractive to you. Beware 
          of bad company, for they are the devils among men. You should make friends 
          with those who will help you to remain steadfast. Beware of arguing 
          about matters of religion, for this causes anxiety and confusion. Strive 
          to worship Allaah, for He guides those who strive for His sake to the 
          straight path. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
 “As for those who strive hard in Us (Our Cause), 
          We will surely guide them to Our paths (i.e. Allaah’s religion — Islamic 
          Monotheism). And verily, Allaah is with the Muhsinoon 
          (good-doers)” [al-‘Ankaboot 29:69]",Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Barraak

7833,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7833,Children Stealing,I became very upset after I discovered that one of my children had stolen something and I am afraid that he may become a thief in the future. What advice can you give me?,,,"Praise be to Allah.A young child may steal for a number of reasons:


He steals because he does not know the difference between borrowing and stealing, and the concept of personal ownership is not clear in his mind.


Some children steal because they are deprived of things that others have.


Some steal to take revenge on the parents or to attract their attention.


What do we advise?


Keep calm. Instead of rebuking him and putting him to shame, keep calm. This situation is an opportunity to teach your child.


Advise and exhort the child. Explain to him the Islamic rulings concerning stealing, and tell him that Allaah says in His Book (interpretation of the meaning):


“Cut off (from the wrist joint) the (right) hand of the thief, male or female…” [al-Maa’idah 5:38]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) accepted the pledge of women, when they made bay’ah (oath of allegiance) to him, that they would not steal, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“… that they will not steal…” [al-Mumtahinah 60:12].
Remind your child that Allaah is always watching. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“He is with you (by His Knowledge) wheresoever you may be” [al-Hadeed 57:4]
And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“… Allaah is Witness to what you do.” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:98]
Tell him: Allaah can see you even if you steal something in secret, far away from the view of people, because He says (interpretation of the meaning):
“He knows the secret and that which is yet more hidden.” [Ta-Ha 20:7]
Confront the child: you have to confront the child with the reason and motive for stealing. For example, you could say to him, “I know that you took candy from the store, and that you took it because you felt that you needed it, but stealing it was not the answer. Next time, if you want something, talk to me first. I know that you want to be honest.” Try to make the child see how others feel – “If you were in the place of the person whose property was stolen, how would you feel?”
Making the punishment severe, such as making the child return the stolen property and apologizing, or making him pay the value of the item if it has been damaged or used up, whilst also depriving him of some privileges at home.
Supervising the child and not leaving him alone for a long time.
And Allaah is the Guide to the Straight Path.

7834,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7834,"Ruling on commercial
    advertising","If I have some kind of business or goods
      to sell, is it permissible for me to launch a campaign to advertise these products or
      services?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The idea of advertising in order to attract business is
    one of the modern ideas that cannot be regarded as being exempt from the general Islamic
    principles governing transactions. But because, in many cases, this method of attracting
    business has gone too far, we have to mention these general principles in detail, paying
    special attention to the aims of Shareeah and correct etiquette. This includes the
    following points:
Firstly: the businessman must have a good intention when advertising,
    i.e. his intention should be to acquaint people with the advantages of his goods or
    services, to draw their attention to things they did not know about them, and to provide
    other information that they may need about them.
Secondly: he must always be honest in his advertising; what he says
    must reflect the reality of the product or service. Honesty is an essential fundamental in
    all dealings, but especially in selling. The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be
    upon him) said: The two parties engaged in a transaction have the choice of either
    going ahead with the transaction or canceling it, until they part. If they are open and
    honest, their transaction will be blessed for them, but if they conceal things and tell
    lies, that will destroy the Barakah (blessing) of their transaction. (Narrated
    by al-Bukhaari, no. 2079 (2/82-83), and by Muslim, 1532 (3/162), from the hadeeth of
    Hakeem ibn Hizaam). One of the essential means of being honest is to avoid
    over-praising a product or service or exaggerating about it, for this could go beyond the
    bounds of being open and honest. The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)
    said: Try not to praise products to one another (Al-Tirmidhi, no. 1268), i.e., the vendor should not praise it in order to encourage the one who hears
    him to buy it, so that the only reason he buys it is what the vendor says. Some of the
    scholars counted praise of a product for what it is as a kind of insane or senseless
    speech from which people should refrain. The guideline here is that the vendor should
    refrain from saying anything which could later result in regret on the part of the
    purchaser.
    Thirdly: the vendor should avoid any kind of cheating and deception in
    his advertising; i.e., he should not make the product appear more attractive than it is,
    or conceal its faults, or praise it in terms of characteristics and features that it does
    not have. All of this is haraam, as stated above.
Fourthly: a vendors advertising should not include any
    condemnation or belittling of any other person's products or services, and it should not
    try to cause harm unjustly to others. The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
    him) said: None of you truly believes until he wants for his brother what he wants
    for himself. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, no. 13 (1/2), and by Muslim, no. 45
    (1/67), from the hadeeth of Anas ibn Maalik). The guideline here is that if
    something would cause him distress if it were done to him, he should not do it to others.
    The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: There should be no
    harm and no reciprocating of harm. (Narrated by Ahmad, 5/326-327, 313), and
    by Ibn Maajah, no. 2340-2341, from the hadeeth of Ubaadah ibn Saamit).
    Fifthly: the advertising should contain nothing that
    calls people to be extravagant or to spend too much, because these are things that are
    forbidden in Islam. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
 and waste not by extravagance. Verily, He likes not
    Al-Musrifoon (those who waste by extravagance). [al-Anaam 6:141]
But spend not wastefully (your wealth) in the manner of a
    spendthrift. Verily, the spendthrifts are brothers of the Shayaateen (devils)
    [al-Israa 17:26-27]
Sixthly: the advertising should contain nothing that violates the
    sanctity of the pure shareeah, such as advertising haraam things or being
    accompanied by things that are not allowed, such as music and singing, or showing women,
    and so on.
Seventhly: the advertising should not be so expensive that the consumer
    has to pay towards the cost of the advertising. It should be brief and to the point,
    concisely describing the product or service without going to extremes that may cause the
    price to be raised.

      loan from the real-estate fund to the purchaser? (The real-estate fund is a fund for

      residence). To explain further: if the land is worth, for example, 500,000 when it is not
      registered with the real-estate fund, then the owner goes and applies for a loan from the
      fund, and takes a number to wait his turn. When his turn comes, say three years later, he

Answer:
No, it is for something that is his. He may or may not get the loan,

The believers are nothing else than brothers (in Islamic religion) [al-Hujuraat 49:10]
And He describes them (interpretation of the meaning):
severe against disbelievers, and merciful among themselves [al-Fath 48:29]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The relationship of the believer towards the people of faith is like that of the head to the body. The believer feels the pain of the people of faith just as the body feels the pain of the head.
(Narrated by Imaam Ahmad).
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) neatly summed up the ways in which a believer can support his fellow-believer. He said:
There are different ways of supporting a fellow believer: with ones wealth, with ones position of authority or power, by means of physical service, by offering sincere advice and guidance, by making supplication (duaa) and asking for forgiveness for them, and by feeling their pain. The level of ones support will be affected by the level of one's faith. The weaker a person's faith, the weaker his support will be; the stronger the faith, the stronger the support. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was the greatest of all people in his support for his companions, so the more closely his followers follow him, the greater will be their support for their fellow-believers. (al-Fawaaid, 1/171)

I am asking this question because I heard from my friends that it is not permissible for a man to have intercourse with his wife during her period. May Allaah reward you with good for this program which has given me the opportunity to ask about an embarrassing matter such as this. I am suffering from this problem and do not know what to do. May Allaah make you a source of help for Islam and the Muslims.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is haraam (forbidden) for a man to have intercourse with his wife during her period.
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“They ask you concerning menstruation. Say: that is an Adha (a harmful thing for a husband to have a sexual intercourse with his wife while she is having her menses), therefore, keep away from women during menses and go not unto them till they are purified (from menses and have taken a bath)” [al-Baqarah 2:222].
So it is not permissible for a man to have intercourse with his wife until she has become pure and has taken a bath (made ghusl), because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And when they have purified themselves, then go in unto them as Allâh has ordained for you (go in unto them in any manner as long as it is in their vagina).” [al-Baqarah 2:222]
Another indication of how abhorrent this sin is, is the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Whoever has intercourse with a menstruating woman, or has anal intercourse with a woman, or goes to a fortune-teller, has disbelieved in what was revealed to Muhammad.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi from Abu Hurayrah, 1/243; see also Saheeh al-Jaami’, 5918).

7842,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7842,Ruling on sales or    offering discounts,"Some stores hold sales or offer discounts as a kind of promotion to attract customers. Is it permissible for me, as a storekeeper, to do this? What is the ruling on buying from stores during their sales?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Most of the scholars say that it is permissible to sell goods and services for less than the going rate.
This is the view of the Hanafi madhhab, Ibn Rushd among the Malikis, the Shaafa’is and Hanbalis, and of Ibn Hazam among the Zaahiris.
The evidence for this opinion is:
Firstly: that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) counted interference with the setting of prices to be a form of oppression (zulm) which should be stopped. He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:
“Allah is the One Who withholds, bestows and sets values. I hope that I will not meet Allah with anyone demanding restitution from me for any wrongdoing I may have done to him with regard to his blood or his wealth.”
(Narrated by Imam Ahmad in al-Musnad, 3/165, 286; al-Tirmidhi, Kitaab al-Buyoo’, no. 1314, 3/597; Ibn Maajah, no. 2200, 2/741. All of them narrated from the hadeeth of Anas, may Allah be pleased with him).
Secondly: sharee’ah encourages people to be easygoing when buying and selling, and in all transactions. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:
“May Allah have mercy on a man who is easygoing when he buys, when he sells and when he asks for payment.”
(Narrated by al-Bukhari, no. 2076, 2/81, from the hadeeth of Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah, may Allah be pleased with them both).
Undoubtedly selling something for less than the going rate is included in this. Ibn Rushd said, concerning a person who sells something more cheaply that others in the marketplace: “He will be thanked for that if he does it for the sake of people, and he will be rewarded for it if he does it for the sake of Allah.”(Al-Bayaan wa’l-Tahseel, 9/306)
Thirdly: the price of goods and services belongs by right to their owners, and nobody has the right to dictate to them concerning that or to force their opinions concerning their value.
(See Tabayyun al-Haqaa’iq, 6/28; al-Mughni, 6/312)
Some scholars said that it is not permissible to sell goods and services for less than the going rate. This is the view of the Malikis.
The more correct view is that it is permissible to sell things for less than the going rate, because of the strength of the evidence that this is so, and because sales and other transactions (barter) are based on the mutual consent of the parties involved, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“except it be a trade amongst you, by mutual consent” [Al-Nisaa’ 4:29].
If the vendor agrees to sell his goods or services for a price less than the prevailing market rate, there is no reason why he should be prevented from doing so, as the general guideline is that sales are basically permissible. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Allah has permitted trading” [Al-Baqarah 2:275]
So no sales should be prevented unless it is on the grounds of reliable evidence. But if the Muslim leader thinks that the interests of the people can only be served by preventing sales at less than the going rate, because leaving things as they are may cause corruption, then it is permissible (to put a stop to these sales), and there is nothing wrong with doing so, because the aim is to put things right for people. If the only way to do this is to put a stop to sales at less than the going price, then this is permissible and may indeed be obligatory.

    the age of puberty or are ten years old or more, to sleep
with their mothers or sisters in the same bedding or mattress. This
    safeguards chastity and keeps the person away from
temptation. It also closes the door to evil. The Prophet (peace be upon

their bedding when they reach the age of ten. He said, 
""Order your children to pray when they are seven years old. And spank
    them [to exhort them] to do it by the age of ten

Those who are not approaching the age of puberty still must ask permission

""O you who believe! Let your slaves and those among you who have not
    come to the age of puberty ask permission
[before they come to your presence] on three occasions: before morning
    prayer, and while you put off your clothes for the
noonday [rest] and after the Isha [Night] Prayer. [These] three times are
    times of privacy for you. Other than those times
there is no sin for you or for them to move about, attending to each
    other. Thus Allah makes clear His signs to you. And
Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise"" (al-Nur 58).
However, those who are past the age of puberty must seek permission to
    enter at all times of the day. Allah says,
""And when the children among you reach the age of puberty, then let
    them (also) ask for permission, as those senior to
them (in age ask permission). Thus Allah makes clear His signs for you.
    And Allah is Al-Knowing A-Wise"" (al-Nur 59).
All of this is to avoid any kinds of problems and temptations and to
    safeguard honors. It also brings an end to the means
that lead to evil. 
As for the child who is less than ten years old, it is permissible for him
    to sleep with his mother and sister in their bedding if
there is some need to look after him and if there is no fear of
    temptation. They may also all sleep in the same area, in their
own bedding, if they are of the age of puberty if there is no fear of
    temptation.

7850,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7850,Women wearing    perfume when they attend the mosque,"We have noticed at Taraaweeh prayers that some women come to the mosque wearing perfume that has such a strong fragrance that men can smell it if they walk behind or beside them. Some women tried to advise them, but they said that they wore perfume when coming to the mosque out of respect for the mosque. What is the ruling on this?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The point of reference for Islamic rulings must be the texts of the Quran and Sunnah, not one’s own opinion, mood, desire or ideas about what is nice. Concerning this very issue many reports have been narrated which strictly forbid this (women wearing perfume when they go out). These reports include saheeh ahaadeeth in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade women to wear perfume when they go out of their houses:


Abu Moosa al-Ash’ari said: the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Any woman who puts on perfume then passes by people so that they can smell her fragrance, is an adulteress.”


Zaynab al-Thaqafiyyah reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If any one of you (women) goes out to the mosque, let her not touch any perfume.”


Abu Hurayrah said: the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Any woman who has scented herself with bakhoor (incense), let her not attend ‘Ishaa’ prayers with us.”


Moosa ibn Yassaar said that a woman passed by Abu Hurayrah and her scent was overpowering. He said, “O female slave of al-Jabbaar, are you going to the mosque?” She said, “Yes,” He said, “And have you put on perfume because of that?” She said, “Yes.” He said, “Go back and wash yourself, for I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: ‘If a woman comes out to the mosque and her fragrance is overpowering, Allah will not accept any prayer from her until she goes home and washes herself.’”


The reason for this prohibition is quite clear, which is that women’s fragrance may cause undue provocation of desires. The scholars also included other things under this heading of things to be avoided by women who want to go to the mosque, such as beautiful clothes, jewellery that can be seen, excessive adornments and mingling with men. See Fath al-Baari, 2/279.
Ibn Daqeeq al-‘Eed said:
This indicates that it is forbidden for a woman who wants to go to the mosque to wear perfume, because this causes provocation of men’s desires. This was reported by al-Manaawi in Fayd al-Qadeer, in the commentary on the first hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah quoted above.
Having examined all this saheeh evidence, there can be no room for debate or argument. Muslim women have to understand the seriousness of the issue and the sin involved in going against this shar’i ruling. They should remember that they are going out to seek reward, not to fall into sin. We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound.
By the way, we recently read that biologists have discovered a sexual gland in the nose, i.e., there is a direct connection between the sense of smell and the provocation of desire. If this is true, then it is one of the signs that prove even to the kuffaar how precise are the rulings of this sharee’ah which came to preserve chastity and to block the ways that lead to immorality.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

It seems that this is not permissible, because the purchaser is telling
    the vendor, Lend me the cost of the “smart card”, then I will pay you back with
    something extra. This extra amount is ribaa (usury/ interest). But it is permissible to

Question: what if he says, Give me the extra amount for the phone?
Answer: it does not work this way, because the extra amount is being

Question: does this come under the heading of two contracts in one?
    Could the relationship between the purchaser and the vendor (with regard to the
    “smart card”) be that of delegating someone to do something and paying him for
    his services?
Answer: No, because every contract should be dealt with individually.
    The first contract is with the telecommunications company and the second is with the
    company (which is selling the phone) – and this is not permissible. It is as if they
    are giving him (the purchaser) a loan, which they then give to the telecommunications

Do you think Encyclopedia Britannica is rational 
  and honest? Please read what they have to say about Christmas: 
Excerpts quoted directly from http://www.britannica.com 
  : 
The word Christmas is derived from the Old English 
  Cristes maesse, ""Christ's Mass."" : 
( There is 
  no certain tradition of the date of Christ's birth. Christian chronographers 
  of the 3rd century believed that the creation of the world took place at the 
  spring equinox, then reckoned as March 25; hence the new creation in the incarnation 
  (i.e., the conception) and death of Christ must therefore have occurred 
  on the same day, with his birth following nine months later at the winter solstice, 
  December 25).
...
According to a Roman almanac, the Christian festival 
  of Christmas was celebrated in Rome by AD 336...
 ( The reason why Christmas came 
  to be celebrated on December 25 remains uncertain, but most probably the reason 
  is that early Christians wished the date to coincide with the pagan Roman festival 
  marking the ""birthday of the unconquered sun"" ) (natalis solis 
  invicti); this festival celebrated the winter 
  solstice, when the days again begin to lengthen and the sun begins to climb 
  higher in the sky. The traditional customs connected with Christmas have accordingly 
  developed from several sources as a result of the coincidence of the celebration 
  of the birth of Christ with the pagan agricultural and solar observances at 
  midwinter. In the Roman world the Saturnalia 
  (December 17) was a time of merrymaking and exchange of gifts. December 25 was 
  also regarded as the birth date of the Iranian mystery god Mithra, the Sun of 
  Righteousness. On the Roman New Year (January 1), houses were decorated with 
  greenery and lights, and gifts were given to children and the poor. To these 
  observances were added the http://www.britannica.com/bcom/eb/article/idxref/0/0,5716,266282,00.htmlGerman 
  and Celtic 
  Yule rites when the Teutonic tribes penetrated into Gaul, Britain, and central 
  Europe. Food and good fellowship, the Yule log and Yule cakes, greenery and 
  fir trees, and gifts and greetings all commemorated different aspects of this 
  festive season. Fires and lights, symbols of warmth and lasting life, have always 
  been associated with the winter festival, both pagan and Christian. Since the 
  European Middle Ages, evergreens, as symbols of survival, have been associated 
  with Christmas...  [end quote] 
So as any rational person can see, there is no 
  sound basis for Christmas, nor did Jesus (peace be upon him) or his true followers 
  celebrate Christmas or ask anyone to celebrate Christmas, nor was there any 
  record of anyone calling themselves Christians celebrating Christmas until several 
  hundred years after Jesus. So were the companions of Jesus more righteously 
  guided in not celebrating Christmas or are the people of today?
So if you want to respect Jesus, peace be upon 
  him, as Muslims do, don't celebrate some fabricated event that was chosen to 
  coincide with pagan festivals and copy pagan customs. Do you honestly think 
  God, or even Jesus himself, would approve or condemn such a thing? If you say 
  approve, then obviously you are not interested in the truth.

  or sons, the God of all creation and mankind, to guide us all to the path of 
  guidance and sincerity.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

Is it obligatory?,"Whoever fasts six days of Shawwal will have recorded for him a reward as if he had fasted a whole year. For more, please see the detailed answer.","Is Shawwal fasting obligatory?


Virtues of fasting 6 days of Shawwal","Praise be to Allah.Is Shawwal fasting obligatory?
Fasting six days of Shawwal after the obligatory fast of Ramadan is Sunnah Mustahabbah, not wajib. It is recommended for the Muslim to fast six days of Shawwal , and in this there is great virtue and an immense reward. 
Virtues of fasting 6 days of Shawwal
Whoever fasts these six days will have recorded for him a reward as if he had fasted a whole year, as was reported in a sahih hadith from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
Abu Ayyub (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever fasts Ramadan and follows it with six days of Shawwal , it will be as if he fasted for a lifetime.” (Narrated by Muslim, Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi, al-Nasai and Ibn Majah).
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained this when he said: “Whoever fasts for six days after (‘Eid) al-Fitr has completed the year: (whoever does a good deed (hasanah) will have ten hasanah like it).” According to another report: “Allah has made for each hasanah ten like it, so a month is like fasting ten months, and fasting six days completes the year.” (al-Nasai and Ibn Majah. See also Sahih al-Targhib wa’l-Tarhib, 1/421) 
It was also narrated by Ibn Khuzaymah with the wording: “Fasting for the month of Ramadan brings the reward of ten like it, and fasting for six days brings the reward of two months, and that is the fasting of the whole year.”
The Hanbali and Shafi'i fuqaha explained that fasting six days of Shawwal after fasting Ramadan makes it as if one has fasted for an entire year of obligatory fasts, because the multiplication of the reward applies even to nafl fasts, because each hasanah brings the reward of ten like it.
Another of the important benefits of fasting six days of Shawwal is that it makes up for any shortfall in a person's obligatory Ramadan fasts, because no one is free of shortcomings or sins that have a negative effect on his fasting.
On the Day of Resurrection, some of his nafl deeds will be taken to make up the shortcomings in his obligatory deeds, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The first thing for which people will be brought to account on the Day of Resurrection will be their salah (prayer). Our Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, will say to His angels – although He knows best – ‘Look at the salah of My slave, whether it is complete or incomplete.’ If it is perfect, it will be recorded as perfect, and if something is lacking, He will say, ‘Look and see whether My slave did any voluntary (nafl) prayers.’ If he did some voluntary prayers, [Allah] will say, Complete the obligatory actions of My slave from his voluntary actions.’ Then all his actions will be dealt with in a similar manner.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud).

You can fast the six days at any time during Shawwal, although the best of good deeds are those which are done soonest.
The Standing Committee received the following question:
Should fasting the six days be done immediately after Ramadan, following the day of ‘Eid or is it permissible to do it a few days after ‘Eid in the month of Shawwal or not?
They replied as follows:
“These days do not have to be fasted immediately after ‘Eid al-Fitr; it is permissible to start fasting them one or more days after ‘Eid , and they may be done consecutively or separately during the month of Shawwal, according to what is easier for a person. There is plenty of room for maneuver in this matter, and this is not obligatory, it is Sunnah.”

Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) mentioned ten things which will bring about expiation, one of which is the torment in the grave.
He (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:
“Whatever befalls the believer in this world, in al-barzakh (the period between death and resurrection) and during the Day of Resurrection of pain which is a torment, Allaah will cause that to expiate for his sins.

“The eighth reason: whatever happens to him in the grave of trials, being squeezed, and terror. These are some of the things which will expiate for his sins.” (Majmoo’ al-Fataawaa, 7/500).
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah also said, in Minhaaj al-Sunnah (6/238), that among the things which expiate for bad deeds is: what the believer is tested with in his grave of being squeezed, and the interrogation of the two angels.

I have read things about the punishment in the grave which are very frightening. Is his punishment in the grave continuous, and will it be lightened at all if I do acts of worship and give the reward for them to him, such as giving in charity or doing Hajj? I hope you can help me, because I am still grieving for him very much.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The ultimate fate of your brother rests with Allah: if He wills, He will punish him, and if He wills, He will forgive him. We cannot say anything definite about his case, but we can speak about the matter in general terms.
With regard to the question of whether the punishment in the grave is continuous or it may stop:
Ibn al-Qayyim said:
The answer is that the punishment in the grave is of two types:
A type which is continuous, apart from what has been narrated in some ahaadeeth which say that it will be reduced during the period between the two blasts of the Trumpet, then when they are raised from their graves, they will say:
“Woe to us! Who has raised us up from our place of sleep.” [Yaa-Seen 36:52 – interpretation of the meaning].
Further evidence that this punishment will be continuous is to be seen in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):
“The Fire, they are exposed to it, morning and afternoon” [Ghaafir 40:46]
This is also indicated by the hadeeth of Samurah which was narrated by al-Bukhaari, about the dream in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw that being done to him (the person who was being punished in the grave) until the Day of Resurrection.
And by the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas about the story of the two palm branches, where the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed that the punishment (of the people in the two graves) would be reduced as long as the palm branches did not dry out, so the lessening of the punishment was connected only to the period of time that the branches remained fresh.
And by the hadeeth of Rabee’ ibn Anas from Abu’l-‘Aaliyah from Abu Hurayrah, then he [the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)] came to some people whose heads were being smashed with rocks, and every time they were smashed, they were then restored, and they would have no respite from that.
And by the story in al-Saheeh of the man who put on two garments and strutted about in an arrogant manner, so Allah caused the earth to swallow him up, and he will remain sinking down into it until the Day of Resurrection.
And by the hadeeth of al-Baraa’ ibn ‘Aazib about the story of the kaafir for whom a door to Hell will be opened (in his grave) and he will look upon his place in Hell until the Hour comes. This was narrated by Ahmad, and in some versions it was said that that a hole will be made in his grave and he will feel its distress and smoke until the Resurrection.
The second kind: which will last for a while, and then stop.
This is the punishment of some sinners whose sins are not so great; they will be punished in accordance with their sins, then the punishment will be reduced, just as they will be punished in the fire then the punishment will end.
The punishment may be stopped by du’aa’, charity, seeking forgiveness or the reward of Hajj – this may reach the deceased from some of his relatives or others. (al-Rooh, p. 89)

Please explain to us, may Allah reward you with good.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The precise rewards for the deeds which people do for the sake of Allah is something which is known only to Allah.

“We shall not make the reward of anyone who does his (righteous) deeds in the most perfect manner to be lost.” [al-Kahf 18:30]. If someone has missed some of the days of Ramadan, he should fast them first, then fast six days of Shawal, because he cannot follow the fast of Ramadan with six days of Shawal unless he has completed his Ramadaan fast.

    no one else should be buried. The person who does not pray and who dies when he is a
    person who has neglected prayer should not be buried in the Muslim graveyard, because the
    one who does not pray and denies that it is an obligation is a kaafir according to
    scholarly consensus. If he does not pray out of laziness, then he is a kaafir according to
    the more correct scholarly view. It is prescribed in Islam for a Muslim to leave

7867,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7867,Following the    funeral processions of those who worshipped graves,"Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“It is not (proper) for the Prophet and those who believe to ask Allah’s forgiveness for the Mushrikoon, even though they be of kin, after it has become clear to them that they are the dwellers of the Fire (because they died in a state of disbelief).” [al-Tawbah 9:113]
The apparent meaning of this aayah is that it is not allowed to ask for forgiveness for mushrikeen even if they are close relatives. Many of us Bedouin Arabs have parents and relatives who are accustomed to offering sacrifices at graves, seeking a means of reaching Allah through the occupants of those graves, fulfilling vows to offer sacrifices at their graves, and seeking the help of the occupants of the graves to alleviate distress and heal disease. They have died in this state, for no one reached them who could teach them about Tawheed and the true meaning of Laa ilaaha ill-Allah, or who could teach them that vows, supplications and worship are not right unless they are directed to Allah Alone. Is it correct to walk in their funeral procession, to pray over them, to make du`a and seek forgiveness for them, to perform Hajj on their behalf and to give charity on their behalf?",,,"Praise be to Allah.If someone dies in the state which you describe, it is not permissible to walk in their funeral procession, or to pray over him, or to make du`a and seek forgiveness for him, or to perform Hajj on his behalf or give charity on his behalf – because the actions mentioned (sacrificing at graves, etc.) are actions of Shirk, and Allah has said, in the Soorah quoted above (interpretation of the meaning):
“It is not (proper) for the Prophet and those who believe to ask Allah’s forgiveness for the Mushrikoon, even though they be of kin” [al-Tawbah 9:113].
And it was reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I asked my Lord for permission to pray for forgiveness for my mother, and He did not grant me permission. Then I asked Him for permission to visit her grave, and He granted me permission.”
(Narrated by Ahmad, 2/441, 5/355, 359; Muslim, 2/671, no. 976; Abu Dawood, 3/557, no. 3234; al-Nasaa’i, 4/90, no. 2034; Ibn Maajah, 1/501, no. 1572; Ibn Abi Shaybah, 3/343; Ibn Hibbaan, 7/440, no. 3169; al-Haakim, 1/375-376, 376; al-Bayhaqi, 4/76).
They cannot be excused by saying that no one came to them who could explain that the things which they did were shirk, because the evidence to that effect in the Qur’aan is very clear, and there are knowledgeable people among them whom they could have asked about whether what they were doing was shirk – but they turned away and were content with what they were doing.

Such things are not known from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or the Rightly-Guided Caliphs.
In fact, Allah forbade His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to stand by the grave of `Abdullah ibn Ubayy ibn Salul, and explained that the reason for this prohibition was that the man was a non-Muslim. Allah said (interpretation of the meaning):
“And never (O Muhammad) pray (funeral prayer) for any of them (hypocrites) who dies, nor stand at his grave . Certainly they disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger, and died while they were rebellious (and disobedient to Allah and His Messenger).” [At-Tawbah 9:84]
If there is nobody among the non-Muslims who can bury their dead, then the Muslims should bury them , as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did with those who were killed at Badr, and as he did with his uncle Abu Talib, when he died, and he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to `Ali: “Go and bury him.”

    them by disobeying Allaah by committing zinaa, drinking wine, eating haraam things,

    division between a man and his wife, telling him some unseen things, and telling him about
    stolen items and where lost things are. Such a person is a mushrik and a kaafir,

Is this possible – I mean that the jinn could kidnap a human being?,,,"Praise be to Allah.With regard to the question of possibility, it is possible, but it is very rare. Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Jibreen (may Allaah preserve him) answered this question as follows:
That is possible. It is well known that Sa’d ibn ‘Ubaadah was killed by the jinn when he urinated in a hole in which was their dwelling place, and they said, “We have killed the leader of Khazraj Sa’d ibn ‘Ubaadah; we struck him with an arrow and we did not miss his heart.”
At the time of ‘Umar, a man was kidnapped by the jinn and stayed with them for four years, then he came back and told the people that some mushrik jinn had kidnapped him, and he stayed with them as a prisoner, then some Muslim jinn launched a campaign against them and defeated them, and brought him back to his family. This was mentioned in Manaar al-Sabeel and elsewhere.

Some people said that it is not permissible for ordinary people to use the Quran to treat people with ruqyah; this should only be done by those who are well-versed in knowledge of sharee’ah.

This is because of the story of Abu Sa’eed and the man who had been stung by a scorpion, “… and we did not know that he ever did ruqyah before that incident”, as is stated in the hadeeth.

For a long time I was a practicing Muslim, who was happily involved in following the message of our prophet (s.a.w.)and following the commands of Allah. About two years ago, I decided that it was time that I should fulfill the other half of my religion and get married, as living as single man in a western country sets you up for all kinds of temptations. Anyway, I went to my home country, where I felt the chances of meeting someone that suited me was greater, and was introduced to several different girls, until finally I came across a girl who I felt I would like to know better. Being overseas, I had little time to really spend too much time with her, so I did the following things before I made a decision: my mother sat with her and told me she was a wonderful girl and she would be good for me. I asked several people about her and not one person had a bad thing to say. I met with her also and found her to be extremely well mannered, have strong knowledge in religion and someone that would make a good wife. And obviously, in the end, I relied on Allah. Both my mother and I prayed that I was doing the right thing, and I also prayed Istikhara to help with my decision.

          do nothing but accept the decree of Allaah and face whatever difficulties 
          Allaah sends by following the means prescribed in sharee’ah. 
 What we advise you to

-Consult a trustworthy Muslim psychologist. 
-Seek help through ruqyahs prescribed in sharee’ah [i.e., reciting 
          Qur’aan and du’aa’s for the purpose of seeking healing]. You can recite 
          ruqyah over yourself, or ask a righteous person to do this for you. 
          
-If things do not change, we advise you to have patience, to fear 
          Allaah and do your duty towards Him, and to persist in making du’aa’; 
          Allaah will make a way out for you. 
-If this goes on for a long time and causes difficulties for your 
          wife, there may be no option other than separation (divorce), and Allaah 
          will provide abundance for everyone of them from His bounty (cf. Al-Nisaa’

How to make du’a during prayer","Praise be to Allah.Du’a in prayer: Specific part?
Note that there is not just one particular part of the prayer when du’a should be offered, rather there are several parts of the prayer where the scholars have stated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) offered du’a, from the opening takbir to the final taslim. 
It is also Sunnah to make du’a after the prayer and there are several du’as that we will mention below in sha Allah. 
It should be noted that the best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the best of du’as are those which are in accordance with the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
The wording of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the best of wording, because he is the most knowledgeable of all people about the Arabic language, and the most eloquent in speech. Allah enabled him to express the most profound of meanings in few words, which is called conciseness of speech. 
Abu Hurayrah said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “I have been sent with concise speech.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 6611; Muslim, 523) 
Al-Bukhari said: I heard that conciseness of speech means when many meanings which it would have taken books to write before are summed up in a phrase or two, and so on. 
The best du’a in prayer
Based on this, if you want to say du’a in your prayers at the points at which it is prescribed and recommended (mustahabb) to say du’a, the best of du’as are those which are said in the wording of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
If you are not able to do that and you cannot memorize these du’as and dhikrs, then the best of du’a is that which avoids going to extremes in using fanciful language speech, and which avoids using rhyme to the point of absurdity, and which makes the du’a sincere and focused on the need in question, saying whatever is easy for you  and whatever Allah enables you to say. 
Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to a man: “What do you say when you pray?” He said: “I recite the tashahhud, then I say: Allahumma inni as-aluka al-jannah wa a’udhu bika min al-nar (O Allah, I ask You for Paradise and seek refuge in You from the Fire). I cannot murmur like you and like Mu’adh.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “It is about them that we were murmuring.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 792; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud)
Du’a after prayer
With regard to du’a after the salam, what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to do is to say, after finishing the prayer: Astaghfir Allah, astaghfir Allah astaghfir Allah (I seek the forgiveness of Allah, I seek the forgiveness of Allah, I seek the forgiveness of Allah). Then he would say all the dhikrs that are narrated at this time. Please see question no. 7646 . 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“There is no sahih report to say that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to raise his hands following an obligatory prayer, or that his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) did that, as far as we know. What some people do, raising their hands after the prayer, is a bid'ah (innovation) for which there is no basis. (Al-Fatawa, 1/74)
Ibn al-Qayyim said: 
“With regard to du’a after the prayer facing the qiblah or facing the congregation, this is not something that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did at all. It is not narrated with a sahih or hasan isnad. As for doing that only after Fajr and ‘Asr prayers, he did not do that and neither did any of his successors (khulafa), and he did not teach his ummah to do that. Rather this is something that some people thought was good to do to make up for not offering Sunnah prayers after those prayers and Allah knows best.” 
Du’a during prayer
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) offered most of the du’as that are connected to the prayer during the prayer, and he commanded us to offer them during it. This befits the state of the one who is praying, for he is facing his Lord and conversing with Him so long as he is praying. When he says the salam, that conversation comes to a close and he is no longer standing before Him and close to Him. 
So why should he not ask of Him whilst he is conversing with Him and close to Him and turning to Him, and then ask of Him when he has turned away from Him? Undoubtedly it is better to do the opposite. 
There is another subtle point to be made, which is that when the worshipper has finished praying, and he has remembered Allah and proclaimed His oneness, glorified Him, praised Him and magnified Him by reciting the dhikrs that are prescribed following the prayer, it is mustahabb to send blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) after that, and to make du’a as he wishes, His du’a should come immediately after this second act of worship, not because it is after the prayer but because it is mustahabb for anyone who remembers Allah and praises Him and sends blessings upon the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to make du’a after that, as it says in the hadith of Fudalah ibn ‘Ubayd: “When any one of you prays, let him start by praising Allah, then let him send blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), then let him say du’a however he wishe s.” 
Al-Tirmidhi said: “(It is) a sahih hadith. It was also classed as sahih by al-Hakim, and al-Dhahabi agreed with him. Zad al-Ma'ad, 1/257, 258) 
How to make du’a during prayer
With regard to the points during the prayer at which du’a should be offered, we will sum this up for you as follows:

After the opening takbir of the prayer and before starting to recite al-Fatihah. This is called Du’a al-Istiftah (opening supplication): 

Abu Hurayrah said: When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) started to pray, he would remain silent for a while. I said: “May my father and mother be sacrificed for you, O Messenger of Allah. What do you say when you are silent between the takbir and recitation?” He said: “I say: Allahumma ba’id bayni wa bayna khatayaya kama ba’adta bayna al-mashriqi wa’l-maghrib. Allahumma naqqini min khatayaya kama yunaqqa al-thawb al-abyad min al-danas. Allahumma ighsilni min khatayaya bi’l-thalji wa’l-mai wa’l-barad    (O Allah, put a great distance between me and my sins, as great as the distance You have made between the East and the West. O Allah, cleanse me of sin as a white garment is cleansed from filth. O Allah, wash away my sins with snow and water and hail).” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 711; Muslim, 598) 

Du’a al-Qunut in Witr 

Al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught me words to say in Witr: “Allahumma ihdini fiman hadayta wa ‘afini fiman ‘afayta wa tawallani fiman tawallayta wa barik li fima a’tayta, wa qini sharra ma qadayta, fa innaka taqdi wa la yuqda ‘alayk, wa innahu la yadhillu man walayta wa la ya’izzu man ‘adayta, tabarakta Rabbana wa ta’alayt (O Allah, guide me among those whom You have guided, pardon me among those whom You have pardoned, turn to me in friendship among those on whom You have turned in friendship, and bless me in what You have bestowed, and save me from the evil of what You have decreed. For verily You decree and none can influence You; and he is not humiliated whom You have befriended, nor is he honoured who is Your enemy. Blessed are You, O Lord, and Exalted).”  (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 464; al-Nasai, 1745; Abu Dawud, 1425; Ibn Majah, 1178) 
This hadith was classed as hasan by al-Tirmidhi and others, and as sahih by al-Albani in Irwa’ al-Ghalil, 429. 

Du’a when standing up from bowing, at times of calamity.  

This is called Qunut al-Nawazil. This may be recited in all the obligatory prayers depending on the situation, and the worshippers behind the imam should say Amin. Please see question no. 20031 . 

Du’a whilst bowing.  

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say: “Subhanak Allahumma Rabbana wa bi hamdika Allahumma ighfir li (Glory and praise be to You, O Allah our Lord. O Allah, forgive me).” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 761; Muslim, 484, from the hadith of ‘Aishah) 

How to make du’a in sujud  

This is the best of du’a, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The closest that any one of you may be to his Lord is when he is prostrating, so say a lot of du’a at that time.” (Narrated by Muslim, 482, from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah) 
There are many ahadith concerning this, for which we do not have room to mention here. 

Du’a between the two prostrations. 

One should say: “Allahumma ighfir li warhamni wajburni wahdini warzuqni (O Allah, forgive me, have mercy on me, enrich me, guide me and grant me provision).” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 284; Ibn Majah, 898 – from the hadith of Ibn 'Abbas; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi. And there are other du’as.) 

Du’a after the tashahhud and before the salam. 

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When any one of you has finished the last tashahhud, let him seek refuge with Allah from four things and say: Allahumma inni a'udhu bika min 'adhabi jahannam wa min ‘adhabil-qabri wa min fitnat il-mahya wa’l-mamat wa min sharri fitnat il-masih id-dajjal (O Allah, I seek refuge with You from the torment of Hell and from the torment of the grave and from the trials of life and death and from the evil of the trial of the Dajjal).” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1311; Muslim, 588 (this version narrated by Muslim), from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah. Then after that he may pray for whatever he likes of the good things of this world and the Hereafter, because of the hadith of Ibn Mas’ud: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught them the tashahhud then he said at the end: “Let him ask for whatever good things he wishes.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5876; Muslim, 402.) 
There are many du’as which may be recited during the prayer, but we cannot quote all of them in this answer. We have referred to a few of those that have been narrated. Our advice to the questioner – and to every Muslim – is to have a copy of al-Adhkar by al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him), which is a lengthy book. If he would like to have something shorter then he should get a copy of al-Kalim al-Tayyib by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, edited by al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on them all).

Adhan and iqamah for newborn


Shaving the child’s head","Praise be to Allah.We ask Allah to bless your new baby for you and to make him among the righteous and pious so that he will weigh in the balance of your good deeds. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When the son of Adam dies, all his good deeds come to an end, apart from three: sadaqah jariyah (ongoing charity, such as a waqf or endowment), beneficial knowledge, and a righteous son who will pray for him.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1631)
What to do when a baby is born in Islam
There is no action prescribed in Shari`iah for preparing to welcome a new baby a day or two before he is born, as far as we know. But one can recite general du`as , such as praying for the newborn to be safe and sound, to be guided, and so on. Allah mentioned in His Book the prayer of the righteous woman, the wife of ‘Imran, who said (interpretation of the meaning):
“(Remember) when the wife of ‘Imran said: ‘O my Lord! I have vowed to You what (the child that) is in my womb to be dedicated for Your services (free from all worldly work; to serve Your place of worship), so accept this from me. Verily, You are the All-Hearer, the All-Knowing.’
Then when she gave birth to her [child Maryam (Mary)], she said: ‘O my Lord! I have given birth to a female child,’ — and Allah knew better what she brought forth, — ‘And the male is not like the female, and I have named her Maryam (Mary), and I seek refuge with You (Allah) for her and for her offspring from Shaytan (Satan), the outcast.’” [Aal ‘Imran 3:35-36]
There follows an outline of what should be done on the day of the child’s birth, and after that:

It is mustahabb to do tahnik for the baby and to pray for him.

Abu Musa said: “I had a baby boy, and I brought him to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). He named him Ibrahim, did Tahnik with some dates and prayed for Allah to bless him, then he gave him back to me.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5150; Muslim, 2145). Tahnik means putting something sweet, such as dates or honey, in the child’s mouth when he is first born.

It is permissible to name the child on the first day or on the seventh.

Anas ibn Malik said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “A boy was born to me this night and I have named him with the name of my father Ibrahim.” (Narrated by Muslim, 3126)
‘Aishah said: the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did ‘aqiqah for al-Hasan and al-Husayn on the seventh day, and gave them their names. (Narrated by Ibn Hibban, 12/127; al-Hakim, 4/264. Classed as sahih by al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar in Fath al-Bari, 9/589).

‘Aqiqah 

Salman ibn ‘Amir (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “For the boy there should be an ‘aqiqah . Slaughter (an animal) for him and remove the harmful thing [i.e., the foreskin] from him.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1515; al-Nasai, 4214; Abu Dawud, 2839; Ibn Majah, 3164. The hadith was classed as sahih by al-Albani, may Allah have mercy on him, in al-Irwa, 4/396).
Samurah ibn Jundub (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “A boy is ransomed by his ‘aqiqah . Sacrifice should be made for him on the seventh day, he should be given a name and his head should be shaved.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1522; al-Nasai, 4220 and Abu Dawud, 2838. The hadith was classed as sahih by al-Albani, may Allah have mercy on him, in al-Irwa 4/385)
Imam ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
Among the benefits of ‘aqiqah are:

It is a sacrifice by means of which the child is brought close to Allah soon after he comes into this world.
It is a ransom for the newborn; his ‘aqiqah ransoms him so that he can intercede for his parents.
It is a sacrifice by which the newborn is ransomed just as Allah ransomed Isma’il with the ram. (Tuhfat al-Mawdud, p. 69)

Perhaps another benefit of the ‘aqiqah is the gathering of relatives and friends for the walimah (feast).

Circumcision is part of the Sunan al-Fitrah (practices related to the pure and natural inclinations of man). It is obligatory in the case of boys because it is connected to matters of purity which are essential conditions of prayer.

Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:: “Five things are related to the Fitrah: circumcision , removing the pubic hairs, plucking the armpit hairs, cutting the nails, and trimming the moustache.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5550; Muslim, 257)
Adhan and iqamah for newborn
Among the Sunnahs for welcoming the newborn, the scholars mentioned that the Adhan should be recited into the baby’s right ear so that the first thing he hears in this world will be the words of Tawhid, which will have a great and blessed effect on the child. 
With regard to reciting the iqamah in the child’s left ear, there is nothing to prove that this is required. (Al-Silsilat al-Da’ifah, 1/491)
Shaving the child’s head
Shaving the child’s head then anointing the child’s head with saffron is very beneficial. Then it is prescribed to give in charity gold or silver equal in weight to the hair. This does not have to be done by actually weighing the hair; if it is too difficult to do that, it is sufficient to estimate the weight and give paper currency equivalent to the price of that amount of gold or silver. 
We ask Allah to protect us and our children from all evil and to keep them safe and sound in this world and in the Hereafter. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.

Should he repeat his ghusl?",I woke up and made ghusl and prayed as I usually do every morning. Two hours later I found out that I was junub. Should I repeat my ghusl in this case or the first ghusl is enough? Bearing in mind that I did not intend to clear the janaba while making ghusl.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    If a 
    person prays then realizes that he was junub, he must do ghusl and repeat 
    the prayer; his first ghusl does not count that he did as a habit or to keep 
    clean, without the intention to remove janaabah, because the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Actions are but by 
    intentions and each person will have but that which he intended.” Narrated 
    by al-Bukhaari (1) and Muslim (1907). 

    Ibn 
    Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (1/158): If 
    he intended to do an act of purification for something for which 
    purification is not prescribed, such as to cool down, and he did not intend 
    the purification that is prescribed in sharee’ah, then the impurity is not 
    removed because he did not have the intention of purification, so it does 
    not count as anything.

If he had done that, he would have taught it to his Companions, they would have said so, and they would have narrated it to others. And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Pray as you have seen me praying.”
Shaykh Ibn Qudamah said:
“Ibn Sirin and Ibn al-Mundhir said (concerning Sujud as-Sahw ): there is taslim [saying salam] in them but there is no tashahhud.
Ibn al-Mundhir said: the taslim [in Sujud as-Sahw ] is proven from more than one isnad, but there is some dispute concerning the tashahhud.” (Al-Mughni, 2/431, 432)
According to al-Nawawi, among the things we learn from the hadith of Dhu’l-Yadayn are:
“That Sujud as-Sahw was done at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).
That it consists of two prostrations, and that one should say Takbir (“Allahu akbar”) for each prostration. They are like the prostrations of prayer, because they are called sujud, and if they had been different, he would have explained that. One should say salam after doing Sujud as-Sahw , but there is no tashahhud, and if one has to do Sujud as-Sahw because of doing something extra in the prayer, this should be done after the salam.” (Sharh Muslim, 5/71)
