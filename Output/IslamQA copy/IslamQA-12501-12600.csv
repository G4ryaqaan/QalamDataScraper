12504,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12504,A weak hadith about the virtue of praying qiyaam on the night before Eid,Is the hadith which speaks about praying qiyaam on the night before Eid saheeh?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.This hadith was narrated by Ibn Maajah (1782) from Abu Umaamah (may Allah be pleased with him) from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Whoever spends the nights of the two Eids in praying qiyaam al-layl, seeking reward from Allah, his heart will not die on the Day when hearts will die.” 
This is a da’eef (weak) hadith which does not have any saheeh isnaad from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
Al-Nawawi said in al-Adhkaar: 
It is a da’eef hadith which we have narrated from Abu Umaamah in both marfoo’ and mawqoof reports, both of which are da’eef. 
Al-Haafiz al-‘Iraaqi said in Takhreej Ahaadeeth Ihya’ ‘Uloom al-Deen: its isnaad is da’eef. 
Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said: This is a ghareeb hadith whose isnaad is mudtarib (unsound). See al-Futoohaat al-Rabaaniyyah, 4/235. 
Al-Albani mentioned it in Da’eef Ibn Maajah, and said it is mawdoo’ (fabricated). 
He also mentioned it in Silsilat al-Ahaadeeth al-Da’eefah (521) and said, it is da’eef jiddan (very weak). 
This hadith was narrated by al-Tabaraani from ‘Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit, who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever spends the night of (Eid) al-Fitr and the night of (Eid) al-Adha in prayer, his heart will not die on the Day when hearts will die.” 
This is also da’eef (weak). 
Al-Haythami said in Majma’ al-Zawaa’id: It was narrated by al-Tabaraani in al-Kabeer and al-Awsat. Its isnaad includes ‘Umar ibn Haroon al-Balkhi who is mostly da’eef. Ibn Mahdi and others praised him, but he was classed as da’eef by many. And Allah knows best. 
This was mentioned by al-Albani in Silsilat al-Ahaadeeth al-Da’eefah (520); he said it is mawdoo’ (fabricated). 
Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmoo’: 
Our companions said: It is mustahabb to spend the nights before the two Eids in prayer and doing other acts of worship. Our companions quoted as evidence for that the hadith of Abu Umaamah, according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever spends the night of Eid in prayer, his heart will not die on the Day when hearts die.” According to a version narrated by al-Shaafa’i and Ibn Maajah: “Whoever spends the nights of the two Eids in praying qiyaam al-layl, seeking reward from Allah, his heart will not die on the Day when hearts will die.” It was narrated from Abu’l-Darda’ with a mawqoof isnaad, and it was narrated from Abu Umaamah with a mawqoof isnaad and a marfoo’ isnaad, as stated above, but all the isnaads are da’eef. End quote. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: 
The ahaadeeth in which the nights before the two Eids are mentioned are falsely attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). End quote. 
This does not mean that it is not recommended to spend the night before Eid in prayer, rather qiyaam al-layl is prescribed on all nights. Hence the scholars agreed that it is mustahabb to spend the night before Eid in prayer, as is mentioned in al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 2/235. Our point here is that the hadith which speaks of the virtue of spending this night in prayer is da’eef.

    In the answer to question no.
    2127 we have 
    discussed the rulings on marriage in detail, and we have defined who is the 
    guardian for marriage purposes. 

    From this it is known that the maternal uncle is not one of 
    the woman’s guardians with regard to marriage. If her father refuses to 
    spend on her wedding and on preparing her for marriage, then does her 
    maternal uncle have to do that in this case? 

    Shaykh Ibn Jibreen (may Allaah preserve him) told us that the 
    maternal uncle is not obliged to spend on her; in this case the closest male 
    relatives on the father’s side are the ones who are obliged to spend, such 
    as her brothers and paternal uncles; or the husband has to spend it and it 
    becomes part of her mahr.

She does not want to have intercource with me. Earlier in our marraige we performed oral sex. Her position now that it is najas (impure), therefore she is turned off completely sexually. We have agreed that to fulfill my needs, I should marry another wife. But my job cut my salary considerably. I am afraid of angering Allah by divorcing her. Could I marry a woman who would waive some of my financial responsibilities until I am able to equally provide for both?",,,"Praise be to Allah.You should know that it is not permissible for you to force your wife to do anything repulsive or that may cause impurity (najaasah) to enter the stomach, and you should have intercourse with her in a natural manner. Your wife should know that it is not permissible for her to forsake her husband’s bed when he calls her to do something that is permitted in Islam and to fulfil one of his rights, which is to enjoy her in the manner that Allaah has permitted. It is not permissible for a wife to refuse to share her husband’s bed without a legitimate shar’i excuse, such as when she is menstruating or bleeding following childbirth. A stern warning is issued to the wife who refuses to share her husband’s bed, and there are many ahaadeeth concerning that. It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘When a man calls his wife to his bed and she refuses, and he spends the night angry with her, the angels will curse her until morning comes.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, Bid’ al-Khalq, 2998) 
It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘If a woman spends the night having forsaken her husband’s bed, the angels will curse her until she goes back.’” (narrated by al-Bukhaari, al-Nikaah, 4795) 
And it was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘By the One in Whose hand is my soul, there is no one who would be pleased with her.’” (Narrated by Muslim, al-Nikaah, 2595). 
It was narrated that Talq ibn ‘Ali said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘When a man calls his wife to him, then let her respond, even if she is at the oven (baking bread).’” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1080, classed as saheeh by al-Albaani, no. 927, in Saheeh Sunan al-Tirmidhi). 
If a woman consistently refuses to spend the night with her husband in his bed, then she forfeits her rights to maintenance and also her share of her husband’s time [in the case of a plural marriage], because maintenance is a right given in return for intimacy. Such a woman is considered to be naashiz (defiant, rebellious, disobedient). Al-Bahooti said: Nushooz (defiance, rebellion) means when a wife does not let her husband be intimate with her or she responds to him unwillingly as if she finds it too much when he calls her, and she only responds reluctantly. 
(Sharh Muntaha al-Iraadaat by al-Bahooti, vol. 3, p. 55) 
If a woman is defiant, then she no longer has the right to maintenance, because maintenance is in return for allowing her husband to have intercourse with her. 
Nushooz means a wife disobeying her husband with regard to her obligations towards him. Allaah has stated what the husband is permitted to do in the case of his wife’s being disobedient. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“As to those women on whose part you see ill‑conduct, admonish them (first), (next) refuse to share their beds, (and last) beat them (lightly, if it is useful); but if they return to obedience, seek not against them means (of annoyance). Surely, Allaah is Ever Most High, Most Great”[al-Nisa’ 4:34]
The fuqaha’ said: If she persists in her disobedience after he has admonished her and refused to share her bed, i.e., not slept with her as long as she persists in that, and not spoken to her for three days, because Allaah says, ‘refuse to share their beds’ – if she persists even though he has refused to share her bed and not spoken to her for three days, then he may hit her, but not hard. 
In this case, it is permissible for him to divorce her. Al-Mardaawi said: divorce is permissible when necessary because of the woman’s bad attitude and bad behaviour, or because of harm caused to him by her actions. So divorce is permissible in this case, and there is no scholarly dispute on this point. 
(al-Insaaf, vol. 8, p. 430) 
But if she has gone off you in a way that cannot be remedied, and she dislikes you so much, then in this case divorce is recommended, because staying married in this case is harmful to the wife. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There should be no harming or reciprocating harm.” 
See al-Mulakhkhas al-Fiqhi, vol. 2, p. 305. 
You will not be considered a sinner if you divorce her in this case.  With regard to the solution of your financial problems, it is permissible for you to marry a woman who agrees to support herself, or who agrees to let you off some of your financial responsibilities towards her, just as it is permissible for you to agree with your first wife to stay married whilst forgoing some of her rights. It is permissible for a wife to forego some of her rights to a share of her husband’s time and maintenance so that he will keep her and so that she may stay married to him, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And if a woman fears cruelty or desertion on her husband’s part, there is no sin on them both if they make terms of peace between themselves; and making peace is better” [al-Nisa’ 4:128]
‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: “This refers to a woman who is married to a man and he wants to divorce her, so she says, ‘Keep me and do not divorce me, and you are freed any obligation to spend on me or give me a share of your time…’” 
al-Mulakhkhas al-Fiqhi, vol. 2, p. 296 
Because maintenance is one of the wife’s rights, so when they reach an agreement that she will forgo her rights or some of her rights, then that is up to her. On this basis then if the woman whom you want to marry agrees to forgo maintenance, that is permissible. And Allaah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

12516,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12516,She did Hajj wearing niqaab – what should she do?,"Last year, I did the Omra and the Haj.I knew that wearing niqab was forbidden, but Ithought that Ihad to wear it because there were a lot of people.During the Haj, someone told me that what I did was wrong and that I had to veil my face with something else. What have I to do to correct this mistake?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Wearing niqaab is one of the things that are forbidden when in ihram. A woman can cover her face in front of non-mahram men after entering ihram with part of her garment, lowering it from the top of her head over her face, without committing the forbidden action of wearing niqaab. 
It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: A man stood up and said: “O Messenger of Allah, what clothes do you command us to wear in ihram?” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not wear shirts, pants or any kind of headgear… and women in ihram should not wear niqaab or gloves.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1741. 
Ibn Qudaamah said: 
Ibn al-Mundhir said: The fact that wearing the burqa’ (face veil – during ihram) is makrooh is narrated from Sa’d, Ibn ‘Umar, Ibn ‘Abbaas and ‘Aa’ishah. We do not know of anyone who held a different view. Al-Bukhaari and others narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “A woman should not wear niqaab or gloves.” But if she needs to cover her face because men are passing close by her, then she should lower part of her garment from the top of her head over her face. This was narrated from ‘Uthmaan and ‘Aa’ishah, and this was the view of ‘Ata’, Maalik, al-Thawri, al-Shaafa’i, Ishaaq and Muhammad ibn al-Hasan, and we do not know of any opposing view. This is because of the report narrated from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: “The riders used to pass by us when we were in ihram with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). When they drew near, one of us would lower her jilbaab from her head over her face, and when they had passed by we would uncover our faces.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 1833 and by al-Athram. Al-Mughni, 3/154. The hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Risaalat Jilbaab al-Mra’ah. 
Doing an action that is forbidden in ihram deliberately for a valid reason requires offering a fidyah (ransom), which is fasting for three days, or feeding six poor persons among the poor of the sanctuary, or slaughtering a sheep in the sanctuary. But there is no sin involved because there is a valid reason or excuse for doing that forbidden action. It seems that this is the case in your situation, because you say that you needed to wear niqaab because there were a lot of men, So you have to offer the fidyah as mentioned above, and there is no sin on you. This is because you specifically mention niqaab in your question, and not covering the face with some other kind of garment. But if what happened is that you covered your face with something other than niqaab, or in a manner in which it is not usually worn, then you do not have to do anything and you will be rewarded, in sha Allah, for your keenness to cover yourself and keep away from the gaze of men.  
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: 
If a person in ihram does any of the things that are forbidden, such as having intercourse, killing game, etc, then one of the following three scenarios must apply: 
1 – He forgot or was unaware of the ruling, or he was forced or he was asleep. In that case he does not have to do anything. There is no sin on him and he does not have to offer the fidyah, and his pilgrimage is still valid, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error, our Lord! Lay not on us a burden like that which You did lay on those before us (Jews and Christians); our Lord! Put not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear. Pardon us and grant us forgiveness. Have mercy on us. You are our Mawlaa (Patron, Supporter and Protector) and give us victory over the disbelieving people”
[al-Baqarah 2:286] 
“And there is no sin on you concerning that in which you made a mistake, except in regard to what your hearts deliberately intend. And Allah is Ever Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful”
[al-Ahzaab 33:5]
2 – He did the forbidden action deliberately but for a valid reason that makes it permissible. In that case he has to do what is required in the event of committing a forbidden action (i.e., offer the fidyah) but there is no sin on him, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And perform properly (i.e. all the ceremonies according to the ways of Prophet Muhammad), the Hajj and ‘Umrah (i.e. the pilgrimage to Makkah) for Allah. But if you are prevented (from completing them), sacrifice a Hady (animal, i.e. a sheep, a cow, or a camel) such as you can afford, and do not shave your heads until the Hady reaches the place of sacrifice. And whosoever of you is ill or has an ailment in his scalp (necessitating shaving), he must pay a Fidyah (ransom) of either observing Sawm (fasts) (three days) or giving Sadaqah (charity — feeding six poor persons) or offering sacrifice (one sheep)”
[al-Baqarah 2:196].
3 – He did the forbidden action deliberately but with no valid reason that makes it permissible. In this case he has to do what is required in the event of committing a forbidden action (i.e., offer the fidyah) and there is sin on him.

Plural marriage brings a lot of benefits, including protecting the chastity of the women whom he marries, bringing people closer together, and producing a lot of children. This is what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) referred to when he said: “Marry the one who is loving and fertile”. And it serves a lot of other purposes. But for a man to marry more than one wife by way of boasting and taking that as a challenge to prove himself, this is a form of extravagance and extravagance is forbidden.

Then how come the shiekh did not mention this and just state one opinion, I can understand if the sheikh sees the strongest opinion for that is his, but the others too see theirs as well. Then why did not he tell us that this is based on his opinion and not the majority of scholars.",,,"Praise be to Allah.This phrase, “the most correct opinion”, means that the opinion chosen is the strongest opinion in terms of evidence. It does not mean that it is the view of the majority of fuqaha’; it may be so, or it may be the view of some of them. 
The view which we chose – which is that it is obligatory for women to cover their faces – is what is indicated by the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and was the practice of the believing women for many centuries. It is also the view expressed in fatwas by contemporary scholars such as ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz, Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, the scholars of the Standing Committee (al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah) and others. 
The Standing Committee, under the leadership of Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz, was asked the following question: Is the woman’s face ‘awrah? 
They replied: 
“Yes, the woman’s face is ‘awrah according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions.” 
Majallat al-Buhooth al-Islamiyyah, 24/75. 
It should be noted that when there is a difference of opinion, Muslims are obliged to refer to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), as Allaah commanded when He said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“(And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allaah and His Messenger, if you believe in Allaah and in the Last Day”
[al-Nisa’ 4:59]
By referring to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), it becomes clear that the Muslim woman is obliged to cover her face in front of non-mahram men. There follows some of the evidence for that: 
1 – Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks (veils) all over their bodies (i.e. screen themselves completely except the eyes or one eye to see the way). That will be better, that they should be known (as free respectable women) so as not to be annoyed. And Allaah is Ever Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful”
[al-Ahzaab 33:59]
Al-Bukhaari narrated that ‘Aa’ishah said: “May Allaah have mercy on the Muhaajir women! When Allaah revealed the words ‘and to draw their veils all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms)’ [al-Noor 24:31 – interpretation of the meaning] they tore their aprons and covered their faces with them.” See also question no. 6991. 
2 – Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts) and not to show off their adornment except only that which is apparent”
[al-Noor 24:31]
In this verse, Allaah forbids showing all adornment except that which is apparent, which is that which a woman cannot avoid showing, such as the outer garment. Hence Allaah said “except only that which is apparent”, and He did not say, except that which they show. Then He again forbade showing any adornment, except to those for whom an exception is made [“and not to reveal their adornment except to their husbands, their fathers…” al-Noor 24:31 – interpretation of the meaning]”. This indicates that the adornment mentioned in the second phrase is not like the adornment mentioned in the first; the first adornment is that which appears in all cases and cannot be hidden, and the second adornment is that which is hidden, and is done deliberately [but concealed from all but those mentioned in this verse]. If it were permissible for everyone to see the hidden adornment, then there would be not point of speaking in general terms about the first and making an exception in the case of the second adornment. 
3 – Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks (veils) all over their bodies (i.e. screen themselves completely except the eyes or one eye to see the way). That will be better, that they should be known (as free respectable women) so as not to be annoyed. And Allaah is Ever Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful”
[al-Ahzaab 33:59]

Sujud as-sawh should be done before the salam if you have omitted one of the obligatory parts or you are not sure how many rak`ahs you have done. Sujud as-sahw should be done after the salam if you have added something extra or you are not certain but one of the two choices seems more likely to be the case.","Reasons for Sujud As-Sahw


How to offer Sujud as-Sahw when doing something extra in prayer


How to offer Sujud as-Sahw when omitting something in prayer


How to offer Sujud as-Sahw when you are uncertain","Praise be to Allah.By the mercy of Allah to His slaves, as one of the beauties of this perfect religion, Allah has prescribed that His slaves may make up for shortcomings and mistakes that they make in their worship and cannot avoid completely, by performing supererogatory (nafl) acts of worship, praying for forgiveness and so on. 
One of the things that Allah has prescribed for His slaves to make up for shortcomings that may occur in their prayer is the prostration of forgetfulness, but it is only prescribed to make up for certain things; it does not make up for everything nor is it prescribed for everything. 
Reasons for Sujud As-Sahw
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about the reasons for doing the prostration of forgetfulness , and he replied as follows: 
The prostration of forgetfulness in prayer is generally prescribed for three reasons: 

Doing something extra
Omitting something
Being uncertain

Doing something extra: for example, doing an extra bow (ruku`), prostration (sujud), standing or sitting. 
Omitting something: such as omitting an essential part of the prayer, or omitting one of the obligatory parts of the prayer. 
Being uncertain: such as when a person is not sure how many rak`ahs he has prayed , whether it was three or four, for example. 
How to offer Sujud as-Sahw when doing something extra in prayer
In the case of doing something extra, if a person adds something to his prayer – bowing, prostrating, standing or sitting – deliberately, then his prayer becomes invalid, because when he added it, that means that he did not do the prayer in the manner ordained by Allah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does an action that is not part of this matter of ours (i.e., Islam), will have it rejected.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1718) 
But if he did that extra thing by mistake, then his prayer is not invalidated, but he should do the prostration of forgetfulness after saying the salam. The evidence for that is the hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said the salam after two rak`ahs in one of the two afternoon prayers, either Zuhr or ‘Asr, and they told him about that, he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did the rest of the prayer, then he said the salam, then he prostrated twice (the prostration of forgetfulness) after saying the salam. Narrated by al-Bukhari, 482; Muslim, 573. 
And Ibn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) led them in praying Zuhr and he prayed five rak`ahs. When he had finished it was said to him: “Has something been added to the prayer?” 
He said: “Why are you asking that?” 
They said: “You prayed five (rak`ahs).” 
So he turned towards the qiblah and prostrated twice. Narrated by al-Bukhari, 4040; Muslim, 572. 
How to offer Sujud as-Sahw when omitting something in prayer
In the case of omitting something, if a person omits one of the essential parts of the prayer, one of the following two scenarios must apply: 
Either he remembers it before he reaches the same point in the following rak`ah, so he has to go back and do that essential part of the prayer and whatever came after it, 
Or he does not remember it until he reaches the same point in the following rak`ah, in which case the following rak`ah takes the place of the one in which he omitted that essential part, and he should make up the invalid rak`ah. 
In either of these two cases, he should do the prostration of forgetfulness after saying the salam. 
For example: a man stood up after doing the first prostration of the first rak`ah and did not sit or do the second prostration. When he started to recite Quran he remembers that he had not done the second prostration or sat between the two prostrations. In that case he should go back and sit as between the two prostrations, then prostrate, then stand up and do whatever is left of his prayer, and do the prostration of forgetfulness after saying the salam. 
An example of one who did not remember until after he reached the same point in the following rak`ah is a man who stood up following the first prostration in the first rak`ah and did not do the second prostration or sit between the two prostrations, but he did not remember that until he sat between the two prostrations in the second rak`ah. In this case he should make the second rak`ah the first rak`ah, and add another rak`ah to his prayer, then say the salam then do the prostration of forgetfulness. 
Omitting an obligatory part of the prayer – such as if he omits an obligatory part and moves on to the next part of the prayer. For example, he forgets to say Subhan Rabbiy al-A’la (Glory be to my Lord Most High) and he does not remember until he has got up from prostrating. In this case he has omitted an obligatory part of the prayer by mistake, so he should carry on with his prayer then do the prostration of forgetfulness before saying the salam, because when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) omitted the first tashahhud he carried on with his prayer and did not go back and repeat anything, then he did the prostration of forgetfulness before saying the salam. 
How to offer Sujud as-Sahw when you are uncertain
In the case of being uncertain, such as if a person is not sure if he has done something extra or omitted something, e.g., he is not sure whether he has prayed three rak`ahs or four, one of the following two scenarios must apply: 
Either he thinks that one or the other is more likely to be case, whether it is doing more or omitting something, in which case he should proceed on the basis of what he thinks is more likely to be the case, complete his prayer accordingly, then do the prostration of forgetfulness after saying the salam; 
Or neither appears more likely to be the case, so he should proceed on the basis of what is certain, namely the lesser amount, and complete his prayer accordingly, then do the prostration of forgetfulness before saying the salam. 
For example: a man prays Zuhr then he is not sure whether he is praying the third or fourth rak`ah, but he thinks it more likely that it is the third. So he should pray another rak`ah, then say the salam, then do the prostration of forgetfulness. 
An example of when neither seems to him more likely to be the case is when a man is praying Zuhr and is not sure whether he is in the third rak`ah or the fourth, and neither seems to him more likely to be the case. In that case he should proceed on the basis of what is certain, which is the lesser amount. So he should regard it as the third rak`ah, then do another rak`ah and do the prostration of forgetfulness before saying the salam.
Thus it becomes clear that sujud as-sawh should be done before the salam if you have omitted one of the obligatory parts of the prayer or if you are not sure how many rak`ahs you have done, and neither of the two choices seems more likely to be the case. And it should be done after the salam if you have added something extra to the prayer or you are not certain but one of the two choices seems more likely to be the case. (See Majmu’ Fatawa al-Shaykh, 14/14-16)

Please advise.","It is permissible to engage in coitus interruptus and to use a condom if the wife gives her permission for that. For more, see the detailed answer.","Engaging in coitus interruptus in Islam


Evidence for engaging in coitus interruptus 


Coitus interruptus: The secret burying alive of children","Praise be to Allah.Engaging in coitus interruptus in Islam
It is permissible to engage in coitus interruptus if a person does not want a child, and it is also permissible to use a condom , but that is subject to the condition that the wife gives her permission for that. This is because the wife has the right to full enjoyment and also to have a child. 
Evidence for engaging in coitus interruptus 
The evidence for that is the hadith of Jabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: We used to engage in coitus interruptus at the time of the Messenger of Allah. News of that reached the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and he did not forbid us to do that. Narrated by al-Bukhari, 250; Muslim, 160 
Coitus interruptus: The secret burying alive of children
Although that is permitted, it is nevertheless makruh and intensely disliked. Muslim (1442) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was asked about coitus interruptus and he said: “That is the secret burying alive of infants.” This indicates that it is strongly disliked. 
Al-Nawawi said: 
“Coitus interruptus means intercourse in which, when ejaculation approaches, the man withdraws and ejaculates outside the vagina. It is makruh in our view in all circumstances and with all women, whether the woman consents to that or not, because it is a means of preventing offspring. Hence in the hadith it is called “the secret burying alive of children,” because it cuts off the means of producing offspring, like killing a newborn by burying him or her alive. With regard to it being haram, our companions said that it was not forbidden… 
These ahadith and others, when taken in conjunction, may be understood as meaning that it is makruh, but not strongly so, and the reports in which permission is given for that may be understood as meaning that it is not haram; they do not mean that it is not makruh.”  
It is better for the Muslim not to do that, unless there is a need for it, such as if the woman is sick and cannot cope with a pregnancy or it would be too difficult for her or would cause her harm. Also, coitus interruptus cancels out one of the purposes of marriage, which is to have a lot of children, and it also means that the woman’s pleasure is incomplete.",Islam Q&A

          of another, he has been killed unlawfully, so the funeral prayer should

The scholars are agreed that if it is stipulated that a loan be repaid with something extra, that is riba (usury) which is forbidden by Allah and His Messenger. 
Ibn Qudamah said in al-Mughni (6/436): 
Every loan in which it is stipulated that something extra be repaid is haram, and there is no difference of scholarly opinion on this point. 
Ibn al-Mundhir said: They are unanimously agreed that if the lender stipulates that the borrower pay something extra or give him s gift, and gives the loan on the basis of receiving something extra, that is riba. 
It was narrated that Ubayy ibn Ka’b, Ibn ‘Abbaas and Ibn Mas’ood forbade loans that brought benefits. End quote. 
The scholars stated that the borrower must return the same amount of property as he borrowed, regardless of whether its value on the day of paying it back is higher or lower than it was on the day that he borrowed it. 
But Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) made an exception in one case, which is if the ruler has forbidden dealing in the currency in which the loan was made, in which case its value on the day of the loan should be worked out, then the loan should be repaid in the new currency. That is because a ban on dealing in it means that it is no longer valid and no longer has any value. 
Ibn Qudamah said in al-Mughni (6/441): 
We mentioned that the borrower should return the same amount, whether the price has fallen or risen, or is still the same. … If the loan was in coins that the ruler has banned, and they are no longer dealt in, then the lender is entitled to the equivalent value, but he does not have to accept it. … Maalik, al-Layth ibn Sa’d and al-Shaafa’i said: He is not entitled to anything except what he lent, because that is not because anything happened to what he lent, so it is like a decrease in its price. The evidence for what we have said is that if the ruler bans it, then it cannot be spent and it is no longer valid. So it is as if part of it has been destroyed or lost. But as for a fall in prices, that does not mean that it cannot be repaid, whether it is a lot or a little, because nothing has happened to it, rather the price has changed. It is like wheat, when the price for it rises or falls. End quote.

Fatawa Islamiyyah, 3/204. 
If a husband takes a second wife, he has to treat his wives equally as far as possible. If he does not treat them equally then he is exposing himself to a stern warning, for it was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever has two wives and inclines more towards one of them than the other, will come on the Day of Resurrection with half of his body leaning.” (narrated by al-Nisaa’i, ‘Ushrat al-Nisaa’, 3881; classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh Sunan al-Nasaa’i, no. 3682). 
When Allah permitted us to marry more than one woman, He said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“but if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one or (slaves) that your right hands possess. That is nearer to prevent you from doing injustice”[al-Nisaa’ 4:3]

          deeds and so on, in a manner similar to the way in which the Sahaabah

12558,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12558,A Christian is asking about the reason for the prohibition on pork,"Why does Islam forbid pork, when the pig is one of the creations of God?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
Our Lord has forbidden eating pork in definitive terms. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say (O Muhammad): I find not in that which has been revealed to me anything forbidden to be eaten by one who wishes to eat it, unless it be Maytah (a dead animal) or blood poured forth (by slaughtering or the like), or the flesh of swine (pork); for that surely, is impure or impious (unlawful) meat (of an animal) which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allaah (or has been slaughtered for idols, or on which Allaah’s Name has not been mentioned while slaughtering)”
[al-An’aam 6:145]
By the mercy of Allaah and His kindness towards us, Allaah has permitted us to eat all good things, and He has not forbidden anything but those that are impure. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“…he allows them as lawful At‑Tayyibaat (i.e. all good and lawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods), and prohibits them as unlawful Al‑Khabaa’ith (i.e. all evil and unlawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods)”
[al-A’raaf 7:157]
We do not doubt for an instant that the pig is a dirty and filthy animal, and that eating it is harmful to man. Moreover it lives on dirt and filth, and it is something that is off-putting to those of a sound nature who refuse to touch it, because eating it is either a cause or a sign of a person’s oddness. 
Secondly: 
With regard to the physical harm caused by eating pork, modern science has proved a number of things, such as the following: 
‎Pork is regarded as one of the kinds of meat that contain the most cholesterol, an increase of which in the bloodstream leads to an increased likelihood of blocked arteries. The fatty acids in pork are also of an unusual formation, when compared with the fatty acids in other types of food, which makes them more easily absorbed by the body, thus increasing cholesterol levels.
‎Pork meat and pork fat contribute to the spread of cancers of the colon, rectum, prostate and blood.
‎Pork meat and pork fat contribute to obesity and related diseases that are difficult to treat.
‎Eating pork leads to scabies, allergies and stomach ulcers.
‎Eating pork causes lung infections which result from tapeworms, lungworms and microbial infections of the lungs.
The most serious danger of eating pork is that pork contains tapeworms which may grow to a length of 2-3 meters. The growth of the eggs of these worms in the human body may lead to insanity and hysteria if they grow in the area of the brain. If they grow in the region of the heart that may lead to high blood pressure and heart attacks. Another kind of worm that is to be found in pork is the trichinosis worm that cannot be killed by cooking, the growth of which in the body may lead to paralysis and skin rashes. 
The doctors have confirmed that tapeworm disease is regarded as one of the serious diseases that may result from eating pork. It may develop in the small intestine and after several months may grow into a large worm whose body is composed of a thousand segments, with a length of 4-10 meters, which lives alone in the intestine of the infected person and part of it may appear when he defecates. When the pig swallows and ingests its eggs, they enter the tissues and muscles in the form of larvae sacs containing fluid and the head of the tapeworm. When a person eats infected pork, the larva turns into a complete worm in the intestine. These worms cause weakness and vitamin B12 deficiency, which leads to a specific type of anaemia, which may in turn cause nervous problems. In some cases the larvae may reach the brain, causing convulsions, increased pressure within the brain, epilepsy and even paralysis. 
Eating pork that is not thoroughly cooked may also lead to trichinosis (infestation with a hairlike nematode worm). When these parasites reach the small intestine, three to five days later many larvae appear which enter the intestine and reach the blood, from which they reach most of the tissues of the body. The larvae move to the muscles and form cysts there, and the patient suffers intense muscle pains. The disease may develop into infection of the cerebral membrane and brain, and infections of the heart muscle, lungs, kidneys and nerves. It may be a fatal disease in rare cases. 
It is well known that there are some diseases that are unique to humans and are nor shared with any other animals except pigs, such as rheumatism and joint pain. Allaah indeed spoke the truth when He said (interpretation of the meaning):  
“He has forbidden you only the Maytah (dead animals), and blood, and the flesh of swine, and that which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allaah (or has been slaughtered for idols, on which Allaah’s Name has not been mentioned while slaughtering). But if one is forced by necessity without willful disobedience nor transgressing due limits, then there is no sin on him. Truly, Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful”
[al-Baqarah 2:173]
These are some of the harmful effects of eating pork. Perhaps after studying them you will not have any doubts that it is forbidden. We hope that this will be the first step in your being guided towards the true religion. So stop, research, look and think, objectively and fairly, seeking only to find out the truth and follow it. I ask Allaah to guide you to that which is best for you in this world and in the Hereafter. 
But even if we did not know about the harmful effects of eating pork, this would not change our belief that it is haraam in the slightest, or weaken our resolve to abstain from it. You know that when Adam (peace be upon him) was expelled from the Garden, it was because he ate from the tree from which Allaah forbade him to eat. We do not know anything about that tree, and Adam did not need to enquire into the reason why it was forbidden to eat from it. Rather it was sufficient for him, as it is sufficient for us and for every believer, to know that Allaah has forbidden it. 
Look at some of the harmful effects of eating pork; look at the research of the Fourth Annual Conference of Islamic Medicine, Kuwait edition, p. 731 ff; and al-Wiqaayah al-Sihhiyyah fi Daw’ al-Kitaab wa’l-Sunnah by Lu’lu’ah bint Saalih, p. 635 ff. 
But we ask you once again: Isn’t pork forbidden in the Old Testament which forms part of your Holy Book? 
“Do not eat any detestable thing. These are the animals you may eat… The pig is also unclean; although it has a split hoof, it does not chew the cud, you are not to eat their meat or touch their carcasses.”
(Deuteronomy 14:3-8) 
See also Leviticus 11-1-8. 
We do not need to quote evidence that pork is forbidden for the Jews. If you have any doubt then ask people and they will tell you. But what we think we need to draw you attention to is some other things that are also mentioned in your Holy Book, this time in the New Testament which tells you that the rulings of the Torah still apply to you and cannot be changed. Does’t it say in the Bible that the Messiah said: 
“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets. I have not come to abolish them but to fulfil them. I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.”
Matthew 5:17-18? 
With this text, we do not need to look for another ruling on pork in the New Testament, but we will add here another quotation which shows definitively that pork is impure: 
“A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside. The demons begged Jesus: ‘Send us among the pigs; allow us to go into them.’ He gave them permission, and the evil spirits came out and went into the pigs.”
Mark 5:11-13 
Perhaps you will say that this is abrogated, and that Peter said such and such and Paul said such and such…? 
This is changing the words of Allaah and abrogating the Torah and the words of the Messiah who confirmed to you that it would abide as long as heaven and earth remain. Can this be abrogated by the words of Paul or Peter? 
Let us assume that this is true and that the prohibition was indeed abrogated, but why are you criticizing this prohibition in Islam when it was prohibited for you at first?

With regard to your saying that if eating it is forbidden, then why did Allaah create pigs? We do not think that you are serious, otherwise we would ask you: why did Allaah create such and such of other things that are harmful or repulsive?

Is it not the prerogative of the Creator to command His slaves as He will, and to rule them as He will. No one can overturn His ruling or change His words. 
Is it not the duty of the created being, the slave, to say to his Lord, whenever He commands him to do something: “We hear and we obey”?

My understanding is that the Quran is one of the forms of dhikr and dhikr can be done at any time. But few brothers in our mosque feel that it cannot be read between Fajr and sun rise. The reason is we cannot perform sujud during this time and if sujud at-tilawah comes, we cannot perform it and hence we should not be reading during this time. Please answer this question in light of the Quran and Sunnah with some evidence.",It is recommended to read the Quran after Fajr. It is prescribed to offer sujud al-tilawah after Fajr and after ‘Asr because this is something that is done for a reason.,"When you should not read the Quran? 


Forbidden time to offer prayer


Is sujud al-tilawah considered to be prayer?","Praise be to Allah.This question covers a number of issues 
When you should not read the Quran? 
It is permissible for a Muslim to read Quran in all situations, except when he is junub (in a state of major ritual impurity following sexual activity). Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah] said: “The scholars unanimously agree that it is forbidden for the person who is junub to read the Quran.” (See Tawdih al-Ahkam by ‘Abd-Allah al-Bassam, vol. 1, p. 309) 
With regard to what is mentioned about reading the Quran being dhikr, this is correct, indeed it is one of the best forms of dhikr, because it is the words of Allah. 
Forbidden time to offer prayer
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade prayer at certain times . It was narrated that it is not allowed to pray or to bury the dead at those times , but that does not include reading the Quran. Rather it was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that it is mustahabb to remember Allah (dhikr) after Fajr, which undoubtedly includes reading the Quran. 
Al-Tirmidhi narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever prays Fajr in congregation, then sits and remembers Allah until the sun comes up, then prays two rak’ahs, will have a reward like that of Hajj and ‘Umrah .” He said: the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Complete, complete, complete.” (al-Jumu’ah 535; classed as good by al-Albani in Sahih Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 480). 
Disallowing this is not valid unless there is evidence to that effect; how can that be when there is evidence to indicate that it is mustahabb? 
Is sujud al-tilawah considered to be prayer? 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said: 
Some of the scholars were of the view that sujud al-tilawah  is prayer. Some of the scholars were of the view that it is not prayer, because the definition of prayer does not apply to it, as it is not proven in the Sunnah that there is any takbir (saying “Allahu akbar” as in the beginning of prayer) or taslim (saying salams, as at the end of prayer) involved in it. 
The hadiths narrated concerning Sujud al-Tilawah do not mention anything except sujud (prostration) – “he prostrated and we prostrated with him” – except for one hadith which was narrated by Abu Dawud, but its isnad is subject to question (“he said ‘Allahu akbar’ when he prostrated”). But there is no taslim. 
It was not narrated in any hadith, da’if (weak) or sahih (sound), that he said taslim after doing sujud al-tilawah. If there is no sahih hadith to indicate that one should say taslim, then it is not prayer, because prayer has to begin with takbir and end with taslim. 
This is the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him). On this basis there is no need for taharah (to have wudu) or to cover one’s ‘awrah or to face the qiblah. 
It is permissible to prostrate even if one has broken one’s wudu (minor impurity). Whoever studies the words of Ibn Taymiyah will see that the correct view is that which he expressed, which is that sujud al-tilawah is not prayer and is not subject to the same conditions as prayer. 
If you recite the Quran from memory and you do not have wudu , and you come to a verse  where sujud is required, then according to this view you may prostrate and it is OK. Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), even though he was known to be very strict, used to prostrate when he did not have wudu, but to be on the safe side it is better not to prostrate without having wudu. (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’ by Ibn ‘Uthaymin, vol. 4, p. 126) 
On this basis, it is permissible to read the Quran after Fajr prayer, indeed it is mustahabb.
With regard to the issue of the reader coming across a verse where sujud al-tilawah is required, after Fajr or after ‘Asr, Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked whether the person who is reading the Quran after ‘Asr or after Fajr should do sujud al-tilawah. He said: 
“It is prescribed to do sujud al-tilawah after Fajr and after ‘Asr, because this is something that is done for a reason, and because it does not come under the rulings of prayer according to the more correct of the two scholarly views. Rather it comes under the ruling of reading Quran and saying tasbih (“subhan Allah”) and tahlil (“la ilaha ill-Allah”), so it is permissible for the one who is reading Quran to do sujud al-tilawah, even if he does not have wudu, according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions.” (Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him), vol. 2, p. 344)

Do you have to be married to have one? How can you finalize it and get one and state this person as your right hand servant?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
If Allaah enables the Muslim mujahideen to 
    defeat kaafir enemies in war, then the men may be killed, ransomed, set free without ransom or enslaved. The choice between these four options is 
    to be made by the ruler, according to what he thinks is the best course. 
With regard to the women, they become slaves 
    and “those whom one's right hand possesses” (described as a “right hand servant” in the question). Male children also become slaves. The ruler 
    shares out these slaves among the mujaahideen. 
Shaykh al-Shanqeeti (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The reason why a person may be taken 
    as a slave is his being a kaafir and waging war against Allaah and His Messenger. If Allaah enables the Muslims who are striving and sacrificing 
    their lives and their wealth and all that Allaah has given them to make the word of Allaah supreme over the kaafirs, then He allows them to 
    enslave the kuffaar when they capture them, unless the ruler chooses to free them or to ransom them, if that serves the interests of the Muslims. 
Adwa’ al-Bayaan, 
    3/387 
Islam limited the sources of slaves which 
    existed before the mission of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to just one source, namely slavery resulting from 
    capturing prisoners from among the kuffaar.  
Islam treated female slaves more kindly in 
    their enslavement than other cultures did. Their honour was not considered to be permissible to anyone by way of prostitution, which was the fate 
    of female prisoners of war in most cases. Rather Islam made them the property of their masters alone, and forbade anyone else to also have 
    intercourse with them, even if that was his son. Islam made it their right to become free through a contract of manumission; it encouraged setting 
    them free and promised reward for that. Islam made setting slaves free an obligation in the case of some kinds of expiation (kafaarah), such as 
    the expiation for accidental killing, zihaar (a jaahili form of divorce in which a man said to his wife, “You are to me as my mother’s back”), and 
    breaking oaths. They received the best treatment from their masters, as was enjoined by the pure sharee’ah. 
Secondly: 
A mujaahid does not have to be married in 
    order to gain possession of a “slave whom one’s right hand possesses.” None of the scholars expressed such a view. 
Thirdly: 
If a mujaahid takes possession of a female 
    slave or male slave, it is permissible for him to sell them. In either case – whether one acquires a slave through battle or through purchase – it 
    is not permissible for a man to have intercourse with a female slave until she has had a period from which it may be ascertained that she is not 
    pregnant. If she is pregnant then he must wait until she gives birth. 
It was narrated that Ruwayfi’ ibn Thaabit 
    al-Ansaari said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say on the day of Hunayn: “It is not permissible 
    for any man who believes in Allaah and the Last Day to irrigate the crop of another else – meaning to have intercourse with a woman who is 
    pregnant. And it is not permissible for a man who believes in Allaah and the Last Day to have intercourse with a captured woman until he has 
    established that she is not pregnant. And it is not permissible for a man who believes in Allaah and the Last Day to sell any booty until it has 
    been shared out.” 
Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2158; classed as 
    hasan by Shaykh al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 1890.  
For many reasons, including the fact that the 
    Muslims have long since given up jihad, slavery is now very rare. This means that the Muslims must be extra cautious by examining any case in 
    which it is claimed that someone is a slave, whether male or female.

12564,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12564,A Christian is asking about the prohibition on alcohol,Why does Islam forbid alcohol whilst promising the people of Paradise that they will drink wine there?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.We have already listed some of the evil consequences that result from drinking alcohol, which are the reason why drinking it is absolutely forbidden in the religion of Allah. See for example question no 40882. 
But the questioner – may Allah guide us and him to knowledge of the truth – thinks that the prohibition on alcohol in this world, and the promise to the believers that they will enjoy it in Paradise, is a contradiction or fault in the religion of Allah, or at best he is confused by this. 
Allah forbid that there should be any contradiction in his Book or His laws, for He is the All-Knowing, All-Wise, All-Aware. Contradictions come from others, not from Him, may He be exalted. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Do they not then consider the Quran carefully? Had it been from other than Allah, they would surely, have found therein many a contradiction” [Al-Nisa’ 4:82]
Contradictions come from human beings when they try to criticize the revealed words, and from their misunderstanding when they fail to grasp the intended meaning or the wisdom behind the words. 
The Book of Allah is protected by Him, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Quran) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption)” [Al-Hijr 15:9]. 
With regard to other books (scriptures), Allah has not guaranteed to preserve them, rather He commanded their people to guard them, but they altered them and changed them, so no one longer has any doubt that they have been changed from the form in which Allah revealed them. Indeed anyone among the people of these Books who has the slightest knowledge does not claim that this is how they were revealed from God or that the Messiah conveyed them like this during his lifetime. See question no. 47516. 
Now let us return to the question and ask the questioner: 
Are you objecting to the prohibition on alcohol in this world? Do you want it to be permitted as it will be a delight for the people of Paradise? In that case we ask you: Wasn’t alcohol forbidden in your holy Book, and is that not mentioned repeatedly in the Old Testament in which you believe? If you do not know about that, then listen: 
“Woe to those who are champions at drinking wine and champions at mixing drinks”
Isaiah 5:22 (New International Version) 
“Do not join those who drink too much wine or gorge themselves on meat, for drunkards and gluttons become poor”
Proverbs 23:20-21 (New International Version) 
“Then the LORD said to Aaron: ‘You and your sons are not to drink wine or other fermented drink whenever you go into the Tent of Meeting, or you will die. This is a lasting ordinance for the generations to come. You must distinguish between the holy and the profane, between the unclean and the clean.’”
Leviticus 10:8-10 (New International Version) 
This is sufficient evidence for anyone who is wise; as for discussing these verses in detail, we do not have room to do so here. 
Even in the New Testament of your holy Book, there remain some verses which point to that: 
“But now I am writing to you that you must not associate with anyone who calls himself a brother but is sexually immoral or greedy, and idolater or a slanderer, a drunkard of a swindler. With such a man do not even eat.”
1 Corinthians 5:11 (New International Version) 
“Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of Gos.”
1 Corinthians 6:9-10 (New International Version) 
“Do not get drunk with wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the Spirit.”
Ephesians 5:18 (New International Version) 
And there any many similar verses. 
“Then which of the Blessings of your Lord will you both (jinn and men) deny?” [Al-Rahmaan 55:13]
If you claim, as you do, that this prohibition was abrogated and that it became permissible for you, then why do you object to the idea that the Quran abrogated that permission and that Allah has forbidden it to people in this world? 
Or are you objecting to the fact that it will become a delight in the Hereafter after it was forbidden in this world? Do you want it to be forbidden in both realms? 
In that case, it remains for us to ask you: if you accept that the prohibition of alcohol in this world was abrogated, so it became permissible – as you claim – then is it not more appropriate that you should accept that in the Hereafter? Even though the Hereafter is not a place of obligations, rather it is the place of delight for the people of Paradise and the torment of Hell for the people of the Fire. 
But we say this simply for the sake of argument, to show to him that he was being fair to his opponent when he did not look at what he has (in the Bible). 
But if the questioner really wants to know the truth, then the truth is simpler than that, for it is light, and in that case we say to him: 
Allah has forbidden alcohol because it is an evil abomination, of the Devil’s handiwork; it destroys the mind of the one who drinks it and distracts him from worshipping and obeying Allah, and leads him to disobey Him, and it generates enmity and hatred in the hearts of the believers. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Intoxicants (all kinds of alcoholic drinks), and gambling, and Al‑Ansaab (stone altars for sacrifices to idols etc), and Al‑Azlaam (arrows for seeking luck or decision) are an abomination of Shaytaan’s (Satan’s) handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) in order that you may be successful.
91. Shaytaan (Satan) wants only to excite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants (alcoholic drinks) and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of Allah and from As‑Salaah (the prayer). So, will you not then abstain?” [Al-Maa’idah 5:90-91]
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Every intoxicant is khamr and all khamr is haraam.” Saheeh Muslim, 2003. 
This is what it says in your holy Book: 
“Then the LORD said to Aaron: ‘You and your sons are not to drink wine or other fermented drink ... You must distinguish between the holy and the profane, between the unclean and the clean.’”
Leviticus 10:8-10 (New International Version) 
As for the wine of the Hereafter, it is delightful and is free of all the filth and impurities of worldly wine. Paradise is the abode of the good and pure, and there is nothing in it but good things. Our Lord says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Round them will be passed a cup of pure wine —
46. White, delicious to the drinkers.
47. Neither will they have Ghoul (any kind of hurt, abdominal pain, headache, a sin) from that nor will they suffer intoxication therefrom” [Al-Saaffaat 37:45-47]
They will not suffer any kind of hurt, pain, or headaches, and it will not destroy their wealth. 
The wine of the Hereafter bears no resemblance to the wine of this world except in name. As for its real nature, no eye has seen, no ear has heard, nor has it entered the heart of man. Our Lord says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“No person knows what is kept hidden for them of joy as a reward for what they used to do” [Al-Sajdah 32:17]
The one who contaminate himself with the wine of this world deserves to be denied the wine of the Hereafter. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Every intoxicant is khamr and every intoxicant is haraam. Whoever drinks wine in this world and dies having persisted in drinking it and not having repented, will never drink it in the Hereafter.”

History of playing cards","Praise be to Allah.Is playing cards prohibited in Islam?
The Standing Committee was asked about playing cards if that does not distract people from prayer and there is no money involved. They answered: 
“Playing cards is not permitted , even if there is no money involved, because the problem with that is that it distracts people from remembering Allah (Dhikr) and from prayer. Even if they claim that this is not the case, then it is still a means that may lead to gambling which is expressly forbidden in the Quran . Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Intoxicants (all kinds of alcoholic drinks), and gambling, and Al-Ansab (stone altars for sacrifices to false gods) and Al-Azlam (arrows for seeking luck or decision) are an abomination of Shaytan’s (Satan’s) handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) in order that you may be successful.” [Al-Ma’idah 5:90]
These cards have an effect on society, for the bonds of a strong society are achieved by means of two things: following the commands of Allah and heeding His prohibitions. A society disintegrates when it neglects any of those duties or does any of those things that are forbidden. These cards form one of the factors which have an effect on society. They cause people to neglect prayer in congregation, and they generate alienation, breaking of ties, hatred and negligence through the committing of haram actions, and they make people too lazy to earn a living.” (Fatawa Islamiyyah, 4/436)
History of playing cards
With regard to the history of these playing cards: No one really knows who invented playing cards or when or where they were invented. It has been said that they are of Chinese or Indian origin, or otherwise. But historians agree that they came to Europe from the Middle East in the latter part of the Middle Ages. Experts also say that there is agreement that playing cards have clearly evolved from that time until now. 
Playing cards made their first appearance in Europe in Andalusia, and were brought to northern Spain in the eleventh century CE. 
The traditional deck of cards in Spain consisted of 40 cards, including the numbers 1 to 7, plus three characters, the highest of which was the “ruler”, followed by the “deputy”, then the “scribe” or “knight.” 
In the sixteenth century, the French changed the cards, replacing the “ruler” with the king, the “deputy” with the queen, and the “knight” with the jack. They also added three new numbers, so that the deck now consisted of 52 cards. In the seventeenth century, the Germans added a fourth character, the joker. 
We have quoted above the fatwa on playing with these cards. It may also be added that playing cards is devoid of any of the goals of recreational activities as required in Islam; it does not teach any skill that is needed for Jihad or any useful knowledge or bring any social benefit or relaxation that will calm the nerves. Rather it is a game that has nothing good in it; it causes arguments and simply kills time. It is based on speculation and chance, and it is like playing with dice, in that it leads to disputes and fighting, and it is like alcohol and gambling. 
Based on the above, it would not be farfetched to suggest that it is prohibited rather than disliked, by analogy with dice, because both are based on chance and both lead to arguments. 
The same view was favoured by Shaykh Ibn Hajar Al-Haythami (may Allah have mercy on him), and it is the view of our contemporary scholars, and of Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih Al-`Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) among the jurists of Al-Najd, who transmitted it from his shaykhs. This is based on the fact that it leads to enmity and hatred, and because it is a great waste of time and it distracts people from remembering Allah (Dhikr) and keeps them from worshipping and obeying Him. 
This view is further supported by the fact that one of the French kings issued orders banning people from playing cards during the day, and stating that everyone who went against this order was to be arrested and punished. That was because the French people loved playing cards too much, to such an extent that they were neglecting their work in order to play cards. The punishment dictated by this French king was not just a brief imprisonment, he also added a severe beating as a deterrent to others. 
Yet despite these decrees and others, he did not succeed in uprooting the habit of playing cards; the only result was that the people started to play in secret rather than openly. (From Qadaya Al-Lahw wat Tarfih by Madun Rashid, p. 185-187)

1 – Accepting a moderate dowry and not demanding more of the husband than he can afford are enjoined by sharee’ah, according to the consensus of the scholars of the earlier and later generations. This is the Sunnah that is proven from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
2 – If the husband takes on payment of a dowry that he cannot afford and that is beyond his means, he deserves to be denounced for that, because he has done something makrooh, even if that dowry is less than the dowry given by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Muslim narrated in his Saheeh (1424) that Abu Hurayrah said: A man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: “I have got married to a woman from among the Ansaar.” The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to him: “Have you looked at her? For there may be something in the eyes of the Ansaar.” He said: “(Yes) I have looked at her.” He said: “For how much did you get married?” He said: ‘For four uqiyahs.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “For four uqiyahs! It is as if you are getting this silver by digging it up from the side of this mountain. We do not have anything to give you, but perhaps we will send you on a campaign from which you might get something.” So he sent a campaign to Bani ‘Abs, and he sent that man among them. 
Al-Nawawi said in his commentary on this hadeeth: what this means is that it is makrooh to make the dowry too much in relation to the husband’s situation. 
3 – There can be no doubt that marriage is something that is prescribed and encouraged in sharee’ah, and in most cases it reaches the degree of being obligatory. Most people cannot manage to do this thing that is prescribed or mustahabb when there is this exaggeration concerning the mahr. It is well known that whatever is essential to doing something obligatory is also obligatory, from which we may understand that it is prescribed to make people aware of the seriousness of this matter and stop them from going to extremes in this matter which is preventing men from doing that which Allaah has enjoined upon them (i.e., getting married), especially since the command to reduce the mahr will not lead to any evil consequences, rather it is wholly in the interests of both the husband and the wife, and is in fact something that is liked and encouraged in Islam, as stated above. 
4 – There is no shar’i justification for the woman’s guardian to refuse to marry her to a compatible man if he proposes marriage to her and she is pleased with him, because he cannot pay the large dowry that the guardian demands because of his personal greed or for the purpose of extravagance and showing off. Rather this comes under the heading of preventing marriage for which the one who does it is regarded as a faasiq (evildoer) if he does it repeatedly. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: 
The scholars found a way around this obstacle when they said that if a guardian refuses to marry his female relative under his care to a compatible man with whom she is pleased, then that guardianship passes to another. For example, if a woman’s father refuses to marry her to a man whose religious commitment and character are suitable and with whom she is pleased and whom she wants to marry, then the closest of people to her after him, among her brothers, paternal uncles or cousins, should marry her to him.” 
5 – Increasing the mahr and exaggerating concerning it forms a strong obstacle to marriage, and the many evil consequences that result from that and the spread of evil actions among men and women, are well known. The means come under the same ruling as the ends. Islam came to achieve and complete people’s best interests, and to do away with and reduce evils. Even if reducing dowries were to do no more than block the ways that lead to haraam things, that would be sufficient. 
6 – The evil consequences of exaggerating concerning dowries are well known. How many free, chaste women have been prevented from marrying by their guardians, who have wronged them and left them without husbands and children. 
How many women has that led to respond to the calls of their own desire and the Shaytaan, so they have committed evil actions and brought shame upon themselves and their families and clans, because they have committed sins that anger the Most Merciful? 
How many young men have been unable to meet these demands for which no authority was sent down by Allaah, so the devils and evil companions took control of them, until they led them astray and caused them to lose out, so they lost their families and lost their way, and they became lost to their ummah and homeland, and they lost out in this world and in the Hereafter. 
7 – Another harmful effect of exaggerating concerning dowries is the appearance of mental illness among young people of both sexes, because of having to suppress their natural urges and because of the frustration they encounter when they try to get married. 
8 – Making demands of the husband that he cannot meet may stir up enmity in his heart against his wife, due to the financial difficulties that he suffers because of her. But the aim (of marriage) is happiness, not hardship. 
9 – Even if there is any benefit in a large dowry for the women or her guardians, the evil consequences outweigh any such benefits. The basic principle in sharee’ah is that warding off evil takes precedence over achieving benefits. 
10 – With regard to the story narrated from ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with him), that when he forbade increasing the mahr to more than four hundred dirhams, a woman from among Quraysh objected to that and said: “O Ameer al-Mu’mineen, you have forbidden increasing the mahr of women to more than four hundred dirhams, have you not heard the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): ‘…and you have given one of them a Qintaar (of gold, i.e. a great amount as Mahr)…’ [al-Nisa’ 4:20]?” 
He said: “O Allaah, forgive me. All the people have more understanding of religion than ‘Umar.” Then he went back and ascended the minbar, and said: “O people, I forbade you to increase women’s dowries to more than four hundred. But whoever wants to give as much as he wants of his wealth, let him do so.” 
But this story may be understood in different ways, and cannot be used as evidence or to oppose the proven texts referred to above, especially when there is no report of any objection to ‘Umar or denunciation of him on the part of any of the Sahaabah apart from this woman.

12578,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12578,Witchcraft and Seeking Help From Practitioners of it,"Is there anything such as witch doctors? What should we do if someone says ""I don't believe in magic"" because ""this is just an illusion""?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Sihr (witchcraft or magic) is a word referring to something hidden. It is real and there are kinds of witchcraft that may affect people psychologically and physically, so that they become sick and die, or husbands and wives are separated. Its effects happen by the will of Allah. It is a devilish action, most of which is only achieved by means of shirk (polytheism) and drawing close to the jinn and shayateen (devils) by means of that which they love, and it is based on associating others with Allah (shirk). 
There are doctors who are also practitioners of witchcraft, who treat people by means of seeking the help of the jinn. They claim to have knowledge of the sickness with no need to identify it, and they prescribe for the patient foods and drinks that bring him closer to his allies among the devils. He may tell them to slaughter a pig whilst saying “Bismillah” (in the name of Allah) over it, or to slaughter a permissible animal without saying “Bismillah”, or when saying the name of one of the devils. 
This is kufr or disbelief in Allah, and it is not permissible under any circumstances to go to these people. The hadd (Islamic prescribed) punishment for these people is execution. It has been proven from three of the sahabah (companions - may Allah be pleased with them) that the practitioners of witchcraft are to be put to death. 
The Standing Committee was asked a question about this matter, in which it was said: 
Please note that in Zambia there is a Muslim man who claims that he has with him a jinn, and the people come to him and ask him to treat their sicknesses, and this jinn states what their treatment should be. Is that permissible? 
They replied: 
It is not permissible for this man to use the jinn, and it is not permissible for the people to go to him seeking treatment for sickness through his using the jinn, or to meet any other need by this means. 
Seeking treatment through human medical doctors and using permissible medicines is sufficient and means that there is no need for that, and it keeps people safe from the sorcery of the magicians.  
It was narrated in a saheeh (authentic) report that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever goes to a fortune-teller and asks him about something, his prayer will not be accepted for forty days.” [Muslim]. 
And it was narrated by the authors of al-Sunan and by al-Hakim, who classed it as saheeh, that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever goes to a soothsayer and believes what he says has disbelieved in that which was revealed to Muhammad.” 
This man and his companions from among the jinn are regarded as being among the fortune-tellers and soothsayers, so it is not permissible to ask them anything or to believe them. 
Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah. 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baz said: 
Given that there are so many charlatans lately, who claim to be doctors and to treat people by means of magic and witchcraft, and they have become widespread in some countries and they exploit the naïveté of the ignorant, I thought that in the spirit of sincerity towards Allah and His slaves, that I should explain the grave danger that this poses to Islam and the Muslims, because it involves dependence on something other than Allah and going against His command and the command of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), so I say, seeking the help of Allah: 
It is permissible to seek treatment according to scholarly consensus. The Muslim may go to a doctor to seek treatment for internal diseases, injuries, nervous complaints, etc, so that he can identify the disease and treat it in an appropriate manner, using medicines that are permissible according to sharee’ah (Islamic law), based on his knowledge of medicine, because this comes under the heading of using the ordinary means, and it is not contrary to the idea of putting one's trust in Allah. Allah has sent down the disease but He has also sent down with it the cure; those who know it know it and those who do not do not. But Allah has not created the healing for His slaves in that which He has forbidden to them, so it is not permissible for the sick person to go to a soothsayer who claims to know the unseen, in order to find out from them what is wrong with him. And it is not permissible for him to believe what they tell him, because they speak of the unseen without knowledge, or they summon the jinn and seek their help in doing what they want. The ruling on these people is that they are kafirs (disbelievers) and misguided, because they claim to have knowledge of the unseen. Muslim narrated in his Saheeh that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever goes to a fortune-teller and asks him about something, his prayer will not be accepted for forty days.” And it was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever goes to a soothsayer and believes what he says has disbelieved in that which was revealed to Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).” [Abu Dawood and the four authors of al-Sunan]. Al-Hakim narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever goes to a fortune-teller or soothsayer and believes what he says has disbelieved in that which was revealed to Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).” And it was narrated that ‘Imran ibn Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “He does not belong to us who observes bird omens or has that done for him, or who seeks divination or who has that done for him, or who practices witchcraft or has that done for him. Whoever goes to a soothsayer and believes what he says has disbelieved in that which was revealed to Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).” [al-Bazzaar].
These ahadeeth (reports) demonstrate that it is forbidden to go to soothsayers, fortune-tellers, witches and the like, and ask them questions and believe them, and a warning is issued to those who do this. Community leaders and those in positions of power and authority must forbid going to fortune-tellers, soothsayers and the like, and not allow anyone who deals in such things to operate in the marketplaces or elsewhere. They should denounce them emphatically, and denounce those who go to them. We should not be deceived by the fact that they may get things right sometimes, or by the fact that many people go to them, because they are ignorant and the people should not be deceived by them. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade going to them, asking them questions and believing them, because this is a great evil, a serious danger and leads to bad consequences, and because they are immoral liars. These ahadeeth also indicate that soothsayers and witches are also kafirs, because they claim to have knowledge of the unseen, which is kufr (disbelief), and because they only reach their goals by serving the jinn and worshipping them instead of Allah, which is kufr or disbelief in Him and associating others with Him (shirk). The one who believes them and their claims to have knowledge of the unseen is like them. Everyone who goes to these people and deals with them, is disowned by the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). It is not permissible for the Muslim to accept what they claim is a kind of treatment, such as their muttering mumbo-jumbo or pouring lead and other kinds of nonsense that they do. This is a kind of sorcery and deception of the people. Whoever accepts it is helping them in their falsehood and kufr. 
Majmoo’ Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baz. 
Secondly: 
With regard to witchcraft (sihr), it is real and is not an illusion, and it may have an effect by Allah’s leave. 
Al-Qurafi said: Sihr is real, and the person against whom it is done may die, or his nature or habits may be changed, even if he does not deal with it himself. This was the view of al-Shafi’i and Ibn Hanbal.  Al-Furooq. 
The Mu’tazalis, Qadaris and some of the scholars held a different view, but no attention should be paid to that. Al-Qurafi and others mentioned that the sahabah (companions) were unanimously agreed that it is real before there appeared those who denied that. 
The evidence of Ahl al-Sunnah (those upon the prophetic teachings) concerning that is as follows: 
1.     Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“… but the shayateen (devils) disbelieved, teaching men magic and such things that came down at Babylon to the two angels, Harut and Marut, but neither of these two (angels) taught anyone (such things) till they had said, “We are for trial, so disbelieve not (by learning this magic from us).” And from these (angels) people learn that by which they cause separation between man and his wife, but they could not thus harm anyone except by Allah’s leave. And they learn that which harms them and profits them not.” [2:102] 
This verse clearly indicates what we are trying to say, which is that sihr (witchcraft) is real, and that the practitioner of witchcraft may create a division between a man and his wife thereby, and that he may harm people by means of his witchcraft, but he cannot do any harm except by Allah’s leave. 
2.     Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And from the evil of those who practice witchcraft when they blow in the knots.”
[113:4] 
“… those who practice witchcraft when they blow in the knots” refers to female witches whose witchcraft involved tying knots then blowing into them. If witchcraft were not something real, Allah would not have commanded us to seek refuge from it. 
3.     Further evidence is provided by the fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was bewitched by the Jew Labeed ibn al-A’asam. This is a saheeh hadeeth (authentic narration) that was narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim. 
Ibn al-Qayyim said: The witchcraft which can cause sickness, lethargy, mental sickness, love, hatred and delusions is something that does exist and is known by the masses. Many people know it from experience. Al-Tafsir al-Qayyim. 
Thirdly: 
There are many types of witchcraft, including illusions and deceiving the eyes. But not all sihr is as such. Some scholars listed different kinds of witchcraft, and counted eight kinds, the most well known of which are: 
1.     Knots and incantations  
i.e., reciting words and mumbo-jumbo by means of which the witch is able to use the devils to do what he wants of harming the person being bewitched. But Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“… but they could not thus harm anyone except by Allah’s leave.” [2:102] 
2.     Sleight of hand 
They become skilled in this by means of practice and training to do things quickly, and bring out something hidden.  
For example, the magician may bring a dove and strangle it in front of the audience; then he hits it with his hand and it gets up and flies. 
But in fact there was a kind of anesthetic in his hand and he made it smell it and made the audience think that he had strangled it and killed it, then when he hits it, he wakes it up from that stupor. 
3.     Bewitching the eyes 
This is very common among the liars; the magician does not really put a sword in his body, rather he bewitches the eyes of the audience, and puts the sword by his side, but the bewitched people think that he puts it through his middle. 
These tricksters have become well known among us, because among the audience there are those who protected themselves with Quran and dhikr (remembrance of Allah), and remembered Allah a great deal whilst sitting in the gathering watching the magician, so they saw what really happened, unlike what those who were bewitched saw. 
4.     Using chemicals
This is done well by those who know how substances react with one another, thus producing a substance that is not affected by some other substances, such as the Sufi Rifa’iyyah who make people think that they are not affected by fire, when in fact they coat themselves with some fireproof substances. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) challenged them to wash with hot water before entering the fire and they refused because this would have exposed their deceit. 
And there are many other things that the practitioners of witchcraft do, which could not happen unless Allah decreed it.

      Yes, he has the right to do that. This was done by ‘Umar 
      ibn al-Khattaab, and this is the view of Imam Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy 
      on him). 

    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
There is nothing wrong 
    with keeping the down payment, according to the more correct of the two 
    scholarly opinions, if the seller and buyer had agreed to that and the sale 
    had not been completed. 

    Fataawa li’l-Tijjaar wa Rijaal al-A’maal, 
    p. 49 

    It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 13/133: 

    Making down payments is permissible; that is when the buyer 
    gives the seller or his agent a sum of money that is less than the price of 
    the goods, after the agreement is made, to guarantee that he will get the 
    goods and no one else will take them, and when the goods are delivered, this 
    down payment is to be regarded as part of the price. If he does not then buy 
    the goods, the seller may take the down payment and keep it, and the 
    transaction is valid, whether he stipulated a time for payment of the rest 
    of the price or not. The seller has the right to ask the purchaser to pay 
    the rest of the price once the transaction has been completed and the goods 
    have been handed over. The fact that making down payments is permissible is 
    indicated by the fact that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with 
    him) did that. Imam Ahmad said concerning making down payments: There is 
    nothing wrong with it. And it was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) regarded it as permissible. Sa’eed ibn al-Musayyib and Ibn 
    Sireen said: There is nothing wrong returning the product if he did not like 
    it and giving something with it. With regard to the hadeeth that was 
    narrated from the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), 
    saying that he forbade making down payments, this is a da’eef (weak) hadeeth 
    which was classed as such by Imam Ahmad and others, and it cannot be taken

    It is not appropriate for a Muslim to waste his time in 
    things that will not benefit him, so how about spending time doing things 
    that are sinful or haraam? The time that a person wastes in his day is part 
    of his life, and he should use it in doing things that will bring him closer 
    to his Lord and avoid wasting it in doing haraam or evil things. 

    The program which the questioner mentions is a foolish 
    program which the Muslim should not watch, in which women appear improperly 
    dressed and in which young men and women appear together as 
    boyfriend-girlfriend couples and the like, and in which the contestant 
    collects a large amount of money then loses it if the wheel lands on the 
    word “Bankrupt”. How can the viewer denounce what he sees of nakedness and 
    gambling? 

    Secondly: 

    There is nothing wrong with a Muslim buying a product and 
    then entering a prize draw from that company, but that is subject to 
    conditions: 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    Companies nowadays offer prizes to those who buy from them, 
    and we say that there is nothing wrong with this, subject to two 
    conditions: 

    The first condition: 

    The price of the item purchased should be its true price, 
    i.e., the price should not be raised in order to cover the cost of the 
    prize. If the price is raised in order to cover the cost of the prize, then 
    this is gambling and is not permitted. 

    The second condition: 
The person should not buy 
    the item in order to try to win the prize. If he buys it only in order to 
    try to win the prize, and he has no real use for the item, then this is a 
    waste of money. We have heard that some people buy cartons of milk or yogurt 
    which they do not need, but they buy it for a chance of winning the prize. 
    So you find that they buy it and pour it out in the marketplace or on the 
    way home. This is not permissible, because it is a waste of money, and the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) has forbidden 
    wasting money.

12585,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12585,The member of the congregation has to follow his imam with regard to matters that are subject to ijtihaad,Is it correct to join them in this or should we pray witr seperately?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    It is narrated that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) forbade making Witr prayer resemble Maghrib. See 
    question no. 38230. 

    The scholars differed concerning the case where the imam does 
    something in the prayer that the person praying behind him thinks is not 
    allowed, or if the imam omits to do something that the person praying behind 
    him thinks is obligatory – should he follow him or not? 

    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    mentioned the scholarly dispute and favoured the view that he should follow 
    the imam so long as the matter is something that is subject to ijtihaad. 

    He said in al-Fataawa al-Kubra (2/117): 

    They disputed regarding a case where the imam omits something 
    that the person praying behind him thinks is obligatory, such as if he omits 
    to recite the Basmalah, and the person praying behind him thinks that it is 
    obligatory, or he touches his penis and does not do wudoo’, and the person 
    praying behind him thinks that wudoo’ is obligatory in that case, or he 
    prays wearing tanned leather from an animal that died naturally, and the 
    person praying behind him thinks that tanning does not render the animal 
    skin pure, or he is treated with cupping and does not do wudoo’ after that, 
    and the person praying behind him thinks that one should do wudoo’ after 
    cupping – the definitive correct view is that the prayer of the person who 
    prays behind an imam is valid, even if the imam makes a mistake, because it 
    is narrated in al-Saheeh that the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) said: “They lead you in prayer and if they get it 
    right, it is for you and for them, and if they make a mistake it is for you 
    and against them.” Similarly if the person praying in congregation follows 
    someone who recites qunoot in Fajr or Witr, he should recite qunoot with 
    him, whether before or after bowing, and if he does not usually recite 
    qunoot, then he should not recite qunoot with him. If the imam thinks that 
    something is mustahabb but the people praying behind him do not think it is 
    mustahabb, and he omits it for the sake of harmony, he has done well. An 
    example of that is Witr: there are three scholarly opinions concerning it: 

    1 – That it can only be offered as three rak’ahs joined 
    together, like Maghrib, as was the view of some of the people of Iraq;

    2 – That it can only be a single rak’ah offered separately 
    from those that come before it, as was the view of some of the people of the 
    Hijaaz;

    3 – That both are permissible, as appears to be the view of 
    al-Shaafa’i, Ahmad and others, and this is the correct view.  

    If these people are of the view that it should be separate 
    from whatever comes before, and if the imam is of the view that it should be 
    separate, but the people praying behind him favour the view that Witr should 
    be like Maghrib, and he goes along with them in the interests of harmony, 
    then he has done well, as the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said to ‘Aa’ishah: “Were it not that your people are new in Islam, 
    I would have knocked down the Ka’bah, made its door level with the ground, 
    and I would have given it two doors, one through which the people could 
    enter and another through which they could exit.” But he chose to forego 
    that which he thought was better, so as not to upset the people. 

    End quote. 

    He also said in al-Fataawa al-Kubra (2/320): 
If the imam does not do 
    something that the person praying behind him thinks is obligatory there are 
    two opinions concerning that. The more correct of them is that the prayer of 
    the person praying behind the imam is valid. This is the view of Maalik and 
    the clearer of the two reports narrated from Ahmad concerning such matters. 
    This is also narrated from al-Shaafa’i, because he used to pray behind the 
    Maalikis who do not recite the Basmalah, but his view is that it is 
    obligatory to recite it. The evidence for that is the report narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari and others, that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) said: “They lead you in prayer and if they get it right, it is 
    for you and for them, and if they make a mistake it is for you and against 
    them.” So he said that the imam’s mistake counts against him but not against 
    the one who prays behind him. So if the imam’s view is the correct one in 
    such cases, then there is no dispute; if he is mistaken then his mistake 
    affects him alone. The one who thinks that the person praying behind the 
    imam should not follow him in that says: the person praying behind the imam 
    thinks that his imam’s prayer is invalid. Shaykh al-Islam said: That is not 
    the case, rather he thinks that the imam is praying on the basis of ijtihaad 
    or taqleed; if he gets it right then he will have two rewards and if he gets 
    it wrong he will still have one reward. 
End quote. 
And he said in 
    al-Ikhtiyaaraat al-Fiqhiyyah (70): 
If the imam does 
    something that is forbidden in the eyes of the one who is praying behind him 
    but not in his own eyes, which is a matter that is subject to ijtihaad, then 
    his prayer offered behind him is valid. This is the well-known view narrated 
    from Ahmad. And he said: The reports narrated from Ahmad may appear 
    contradictory but they are not, rather the apparent meaning is that in every 
    case where a person is certain that the imam has made a mistake,  then he 
    has to repeat the prayer, and in every case  where there is no such 
    certainty, then he should not repeat the prayer. This is what is indicated 
    by the Sunnah and the reports. There is a well-known dispute on this point 
    among the scholars. 
So you have to follow the 
    imam, because this is a matter of ijtihaad concerning which the imams 
    differed. 
If you can advise the 
    imam and explain the Sunnah to him, with evidence, then this is what you

Does having intercourse in Ramadan out of forgetfulness break the fast?","Praise be to Allah.What happens if you accidentally drink water during Ramadan?
There is no sin on the one who drinks or eats during the day in Ramadan by mistake and his fast is still valid, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error.” [Al-Baqarah 2:286]
It was narrated in an authentic Hadith from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that Allah said, “Your prayer is accepted.”
 Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever forgets when he is fasting and eats or drinks , let him complete his fast, for it is Allah Who has fed him and given him to drink.”
Does having intercourse in Ramadan out of forgetfulness break the fast?
The same applies if he has intercourse , forgetting that he is fasting. His fast is still valid according to the more sound of the two scholarly opinions, because of the verse quoted above and because of this Hadith, and because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever breaks his fast in Ramadan by mistake does not have to make it up or offer any expiation.” (Narrated and classed as authentic by Al-Hakim; classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih Al-Jami`, 6070.) This wording includes intercourse and other things that break the fast, if the fasting person does them by mistake out of forgetfulness. This is by the mercy, generosity and kindness of Allah, to Whom be praise and thanks.

There is a widespread notion among the common people that divorce during pregnancy is contrary to the Sunnah, but there is no basis or evidence for this view.",,"Praise be to Allah.Divorcing a pregnant wife is in accordance with the Sunnah . There is a widespread notion among the common people that divorce during pregnancy is contrary to the Sunnah, but there is no basis or evidence for this view. 
Muslim (1471) narrated the story of how Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) divorced his wife, in which it is narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Tell him to take her back then divorce her when she is pure (i.e., not menstruating) or is pregnant .” 
An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Muslim: 
“This indicates that it is permissible to divorce a pregnant woman whose pregnancy is established. This is the view of Ash-Shafa`i. Ibn Al-Mundhir said: This is also the view of most of the scholars, including Tawus, Al-Hasan, Ibn Sirin, Rabi`ah, Hammad ibn Abu Sulayman, Malik, Ahmad, Is-haq, Abu Thawr, and Abu `Ubayd.  Ibn Al-Mundhir said: This is also my opinion, and that of some of the Malikis, but some of them said: It is prohibited. Ibn Al-Mundhir narrated another report from Al-Hasan in which he said that divorcing a pregnant woman is disliked.”
Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Tahdhib As-Sunan: 
“The words “then divorce her when she is pure (i.e., not menstruating) or is pregnant” indicate that divorcing a pregnant woman is in accordance with the Sunnah .”

12592,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12592,They work in difficult jobs such as smelting metals,"What is the ruling of Islamic sharee’ah on the situation of workers who work in exhausting jobs, especially in the summer months. I can give you an example of those who work with furnaces for smelting metals. Is it permissible for them not to fast in Ramadan?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.One of the basic facts of Islam, which no Muslim has any excuse for not knowing, is that fasting the month of Ramadan is obligatory upon each person who is accountable, and it is one of the pillars of Islam. So every person who is accountable must strive to fast it in order to fulfil the obligation that Allah has enjoined upon him, hoping for His reward and fearing His punishment, without forgetting permissible earnings in this world and without preferring this world to the Hereafter. If there is a conflict between doing the acts of worship enjoined by Allah and working to earn a living in this world, then he must strike a balance between them so that he will be able to do both. In the example mentioned in the question, he should make the night his time for working to earn his living in this world, and if that is not possible then he should take a leave of absence from his work during Ramadan, even if that is without pay. If that is not possible then he should look for other work where he will be able to fulfil both duties.  
His worldly interests should not affect his Hereafter interests. There are lots of jobs and the ways of earning a living are not limited to this kind of difficult work. By Allah’s Leave, the Muslim will never want for permissible ways of earning a living which will allow him also to do the acts of worship enjoined upon him by Allah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And whosoever fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty).
 
And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allah will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allah has set a measure for all things”
[al-Talaaq 65:2-3] 
If we assume that he cannot find any work other than that mentioned, which causes him hardship, then he should flee for the sake of his religion from that land to another land where it will be easy for him to fulfil both his religious and worldly duties, and where he can cooperate with other Muslims in righteousness and piety, for the earth of Allah is spacious. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“He who emigrates (from his home) in the Cause of Allah, will find on earth many dwelling places and plenty to live by” [al-Nisa’ 4:100] 
“Say (O Muhammad): O My slaves who believe (in the Oneness of Allah Islamic Monotheism), be afraid of your Lord (Allah) and keep your duty to Him. Good is (the reward) for those who do good in this world, and Allah’s earth is spacious (so if you cannot worship Allah at a place, then go to another)! Only those who are patient shall receive their reward in full, without reckoning” [al-Zumar 39:10] 
But if he cannot manage to do any of these things and he is forced to do the kind of difficult work mentioned in the question, then he should fast until he feels that he cannot bear to continue fasting, and then eat and drink enough to keep him going, then he should refrain from eating and drinking. And he has to make up the missed fasts on days when it is easy to fast.

“If a fasting person swallows his saliva that does not invalidate his fast even if there is a lot of it and if that happens in the mosque or elsewhere. However, if it is thick like mucus, he should not swallow it , rather he should spit it out into a tissue or something else if he is in the mosque.

Is it permissible to swallow mucus? 
If it is asked, is it permissible to swallow mucus deliberately? 
The answer is: 
“It is haram to swallow mucus whether one is fasting or not, because it is considered to be dirty and it may carry diseases produced by the body. But it does not break the fast if a fasting person swallows it, because it does not come from blood and swallowing it is not regarded as food or drink. If he swallows it after it reaches the mouth, it does not break the fast. (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 6/428 by Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymin, may Allah have mercy on him)

Virtues of feeding people","Praise be to Allah.Reward of feeding a fasting person
Zayd ibn Khalid al-Juhani said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever gives iftar to one who is fasting will have a reward like his, without that detracting from the reward of the fasting person in the slightest.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 807; Ibn Majah, 1746. Classed as sahih by Ibn Hiban, 8/216 and by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami’, 6415) 
Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah] said: “What is meant by giving him iftar is giving him enough to satisfy him.” (Al-Ikhtiyarat, p. 194) 
The righteous salaf were keen to provide food for others and they thought that this was one of the best of righteous deeds. 
One of the salaf said:  “For me to invite ten of my companions and feed them food that they like is dearer to me than freeing ten of the sons of Isma’il from slavery.” 
Many of the salaf used to give up their iftar for others, such as ‘Abd-Allah ibn Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), Dawud al-Tai, Malik ibn Dinar and Ahmad ibn Hanbal. Ibn ‘Umar used to break his fast with orphans and the poor and needy. 
There were among the salaf those who used to offer food to their brothers whilst fasting, and they would sit and serve them, such as al-Hasan and Ibn al-Mubarak. 
Abu al-Siwar al-‘Adawi said: “Men from the tribe of Banu ‘Adiyy used to pray in this mosque and not one of them would break his fast on his own; if they found someone to join them they would eat with him, otherwise they would take their food out to the mosque and eat with the people, and the people would eat with them. 
Virtues of feeding people 
From the ‘ibadah of providing food for people stem many other acts of worship such as creating love and friendship towards those who are given the food, which is a means of entering Paradise, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “You will not enter Paradise until you truly believe, and you will not truly believe until you love one another.” Narrated by Muslim, 54. It also fosters the practice of sitting with righteous people and seeking reward by helping them to do acts of worship for which they gain strength by eating your food.
