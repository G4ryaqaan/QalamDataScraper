32627,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/32627,The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not know when the Hour would begin,Did the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) know when the Hour would begin?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Knowledge of the hour is 
    a matter of the unseen which belongs to Allaah and which He has kept to 
    Himself. He has not told any of His creation of that, including the 
    Prophets, Messengers and the angels who are close to Him. Even the best of 
    the Messengers, our Prophet Muhammad  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him), did not know when the hour will begin. 
The texts of the Qur’aan 
    and Sunnah clearly indicate that the knowledge of the Hour is something 
    unseen which no created being knows. 
The evidence from the 
    Qur’aan includes the following: 
1 – Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“They ask you about 
    the Hour (Day of Resurrection): ‘When will be its appointed time?’ Say: ‘The 
    knowledge thereof is with my Lord (Alone). None can reveal its time but He. 
    Heavy is its burden through the heavens and the earth. It shall not come 
    upon you except all of a sudden.’ They ask you as if you have a good 
    knowledge of it. Say: ‘The knowledge thereof is with Allaah (Alone), but 
    most of mankind know not.’”
[al-‘Araaf 7:187]
2 – Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“People ask you 
    concerning the Hour, say: ‘The knowledge of it is with Allaah only. What do 
    you know? It may be that the Hour is near!’”
[al-Ahzaab 33:63]
The people used to ask 
    the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about the 
    time that the hour would begin, so Allaah commanded him to refer the matter 
    to Him: “The knowledge of it is with Allaah only”. 
Ibn Katheer (3/527) 
    said: 
Allaah tells His 
    Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that he has no 
    knowledge of the Hour and that when the people ask him about that, he should 
    refer the matter to Allaah. 
Al-Shanqeeti said 
    (6/604): 
It is known that the word
    innama (translated here as “only”) has the effect of limiting or 
    restricting the meaning, so what the verse means is: No one knows when the 
    Hour will come except Allaah alone. 
3 – Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“They ask you (O 
    Muhammad) about the Hour — when will be its appointed time?
You have no knowledge 
    to say anything about it.
To your Lord belongs 
    (the knowledge of) the term thereof?
You (O Muhammad) are 
    only a warner for those who fear it”
[al-Naaz’iaat 
    79:42-45]
al-Sa’di said:  
Because knowing the time 
    of the Hour serves no spiritual or worldly purpose for people, rather their 
    interests lie in it being concealed from them, the knowledge of that has 
    been kept from all of creation and Allaah has kept it to Himself. “To 
    your Lord belongs (the knowledge of) the term thereof.” 

    4 – Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, Allaah, with 
    Him (Alone) is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain, and knows 
    that which is in the wombs”
[Luqmaan 31:34]

    It was narrated from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “The keys of the unknown are five: Allaah has 
    knowledge of the Hour, and He sends down rain, and He knows what is in the 
    wombs, and no person knows what he will earn tomorrow, and no person knows 
    in what land he will die. Verily, Allaah is All-Knower, All-Aware (of 
    things).”

    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4627. 

    And it was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased 
    with him) said: These five things are known to no one except Allaah; no 
    angel who is close to Allaah and no Messenger who was sent has any knowledge 
    of them. Whoever claims that he has any knowledge of them has disbelieved in 
    the Qur’aan, because he has gone against it. Tafseer al-Qurtubi, 
    14/82. 

    Ibn Katheer said (3/462): 

    These are the keys of the unseen, knowledge of which Allaah 
    has kept to Himself. So no one knows them until after Allaah has informed 
    him of them. And no angel who is close to Allaah and no Messenger who was 
    sent has any knowledge of the Hour. 

    End quote. 

    The ahaadeeth which indicate that no one knows when the Hour 
    will begin except Allaah include the following: 

    1 – The famous hadeeth of Jibreel, in which the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to Jibreel, when he asked 
    him when the Hour would begin: “The one who is asked about it does not know 
    more than the one who is asking.” Narrated by Muslim, 8. 

    2 – It was narrated that Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah (may Allaah 
    be pleased with him) said: I heard the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) say, one month before he died: “You ask me about the 
    Hour, but the knowledge thereof is only with Allaah.  I swear by Allaah that 
    there is no soul on earth that will live for more than one hundred years.”  

    Narrated by Muslim, 2538. 

    What this hadeeth means is: every soul that was on the face 
    of the earth when the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said these words would not live for more than one hundred years. The 
    hadeeth does not means that the Resurrection would happen within one hundred 
    years. 

    And Muslim narrated (2537) that Ibn ‘Umar said: What he meant 
    was that that generation would come to an end. 

    This hadeeth shows that there is no possibility that the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) could have come to 
    know it after Jibreel asked about it, because that was one month before he 
    died. 
Whoever claims after this 
    that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) knew when 
    the Hour would begin is ignorant, because the verses of the Qur’aan and the 
    ahaadeeth of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    quoted above clearly refute that. 

    Ibn al-Qayyim said in al-Manaar al-Muneef: 

    One of those in our own time who claim to have knowledge 
    clearly told lies when he said that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) knew when the Hour would begin. It was said 
    to him that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said in the hadeeth of Jibreel: “The one who is asked about it does not know 
    more than the one who is asking,” but he misinterpreted that and said that 
    it means, you and I know it. This is one of the worst kinds of ignorance and 
    distortion. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    could not have said to one whom he thought was a Bedouin, you and I know 
    when the Hour will be. But this ignorant man may say that he knew that this 
    was Jibreel, and the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) said: “By the One in Whose hand is my soul, he never came to me 
    in any form but I recognized him, except in this case.” Narrated by Ahmad, 
    374. Ahmad Shaakir said: Its isnaad is saheeh.  Rather the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) realized that this was Jibreel 
    after a while, as Umar said: A short while passed, then the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “O ‘Umar, do you know who that questioner was?” Narrated by Muslim, 8. This liar says that he knew at the time of questioning that this was Jibreel but he did not tell his companions about that until a while afterwards. Moreover the words “The one who is asked about it does not know more than the one who is asking” are general and include both the one who asked and the one who was asked, regardless of who they may be, so every one who asks and everyone who is asked about the Hour are all the same.

32638,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/32638,Is it true that there are no da’eef reports?,What is the number of ahaadeeth as compared to the number of narrators? Is it true that there are no weak (da’eef) reports although there are many weak narrators?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.It is difficult to compare the number of reports and the number of narrators, because one hadeeth may have been transmitted by a number of narrators, just as one narrator may have transmitted a number of ahaadeeth. 
The view that there are no da’eef (weak) reports is not correct, because the 
    position of the narrator and his status with regard to his character, precision and memory, has a great impact on the ruling on his reports. 
We will give you some examples of that. 
1 – The hadeeth “Recite Ya-Seen over your dead.” This was narrated by Abu Dawood 
    and Ibn Maajah, via Sulaymaan al-Taymi from Abu ‘Uthmaan from his father from Ma’qil ibn Yassaar. 
This hadeeth is da’eef because the identity of Abu ‘Uthmaan and his father are not 
    known. See Irwa’ al-Ghaleel, 3/150, no. 688. 
2 – The hadeeth “No child should be separated from his mother.” This was narrated 
    by al-Bayhaqi, from the hadeeth of Husayn ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Damrah from his father from his grandfather. Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on 
    him) said: “This is a da’eef hadeeth, and there is consensus that Husayn ibn ‘Abd-Allaah is da’eef.” (al-Majmoo’, 9/445). 
These ahaadeeth are da’eef because their narrators are da’eef. 
It may also be the case that the isnaad is da’eef but the hadeeth itself is saheeh 
    because it is narrated through another chain which is saheeh. 
Or the isnaad may be saheeh, but the text is da’eef, because of some fault in it. 
This is a vast field of knowledge which requires study and experience.

32662,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/32662,When was Hajj made obligatory?,In which year AH was Hajj made obligatory?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.The scholars differed as to the year in which Hajj was made obligatory. It was said that it was in 5 AH, or in 6 AH, or in 9 AH, or in 10 AH. The most likely to be correct are the last two suggestions, which is that it was made obligatory in 9 or 10 AH. 
The evidence for that is the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah) to the House (Ka‘bah) is a duty that mankind owes to Allaah, those who can afford the expenses (for one’s conveyance, provision and residence)…”
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:97]
This verse states that Hajj is obligatory, and it was revealed in ‘aam al-wufood (the year of delegations) at the end of 9 AH, so Hajj became obligatory at the end of 9 AH.

32665,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/32665,The Dajjaal will enter every land except Makkah and Madeenah,Will the Dajjaal go to all parts of the globe or will the people come to him? Will all those who are alive when he emerges meet him? Will some be able to escape and not see him? I read in some ahaadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that the people will flee from him to the mountains.,,,"Praise be to Allah.The Dajjaal will emerge from the east, then he will travel throughout the earth 
    and he will not leave any land but he will enter it, apart from Makkah and Madeenah, al-Masjid al-Aqsa and Masjid al-Toor (Sinai). This is what is 
    stated in the saheeh ahaadeeth. 
Al-Tirmidhi (2237) narrated that Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq (may Allaah be pleased with 
    him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us: “The Dajjaal will emerge from a land in the east 
    called Khurasaan.” This hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
Al-Bukhaari (1881) and Muslim (2943) narrated from Anas ibn Maalik (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no land that the Dajjaal will not enter, apart 
    from Makkah and Madeenah. He will not come to any of their entrances but there will be angels standing in rows guarding them. Then Madeenah and 
    its people will be shaken by three earthquakes, and Allaah will expel every kaafir and hypocrite from it.” 
Muslim (2942) narrated from the Hadeeth of Faatimah bint Qays, which tells the 
    story of Tameem al-Daari and al-Jassaasah, that the Dajjaal said to them: “Soon I will be given permission to emerge and I will emerge and travel 
    throughout the land, and I will not leave any town but I will enter it within forty nights, apart from Makkah and Teebah, for they are both 
    forbidden to me. Every time I want to enter one of them I will be met by an angel with an unsheathed sword in his hand, who will drive me back. 
    Over each of their entrances there are angels guarding them.” [Faatimah] said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said, striking the minbar with his stick, “This is Teebah, this is Teebah, this is Teebah,” meaning Madeenah. “Have I not told you that?” The 
    people said, “Yes.” [The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:] “I liked what Tameem said because it agreed with what I 
    have been telling you about him [the Dajjaal] and about Makkah and Madeenah.” 
Ahmad (23139) narrated that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “I have been warning you about the Dajjaal who has one abraded eye.” [The narrators] said: I think he said the left eye. “He will 
    have with him mountains of bread and rivers of water, and his sign will stay in the earth for forty mornings, and his authority will reach 
    everywhere. He will not come to four mosques: the Ka’bah, the Mosque of the Prophet, al-Masjid al-Aqsa and the Mosque of al-Toor (Sinai).” This 
    hadeeth was classed as saheeh by Shu’ayb al-Arna’oot in Tahqeeq al-Musnad. 
The command to flee from the Dajjaal when he emerges is for fear that people may be deceived 
    by his specious arguments and extraordinary feats, for a man may come to him thinking that he has strong faith, then he will follow him. 
Abu Dawood (4319) and Ahmad (19888) narrated from Imraan ibn Husayn that the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever hears of the Dajjaal, let him keep away from him, for by Allaah a man will 
    come to him thinking that he is a believer, then he will follow him because of the confusion he causes.” This hadeeth was classed as saheeh by 
    al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
This hadeeth indicates that it will be possible to flee from him. The Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded those who live to see the Dajjaal to recite over him the first few verses of Soorat al-Kahf. 
    Narrated by Muslim, 2937. 
Al-Tayyib said: What this means is that reciting these verses will bring 
    protection from his fitnah and confusion. 
Abu Dawood (4331) added: “For they will be your protection from his fitnah.”

32667,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/32667,Lying down after praying two rak’ahs of Fajr,"Before praying Fajr, some worshippers quietly recite some dhikr and the like, then they lie down on their right sides for less than a minute. What is the ruling on that?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Lying down after praying two rak’ahs of Fajr 
    is Sunnah, because of the report narrated by al-Bukhaari (626) from ‘Aa’ishah who said: “When the muezzin fell silent after the first call to Fajr 
    prayer, the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would get up and pray two short rak’ahs before Fajr prayer, after 
    the dawn had broken, then he would lie down on his right side until the muezzin came to him to recite the iqaamah.” 
Muslim narrated a more complete version: 
    “Between the end of ‘Isha’ prayer – which the people call al-‘Atamah (darkness prayer) – and Fajr, the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) would pray eleven rak’ahs, saying the salaam after each two rak’ahs, and praying one rak’ah on its own as Witr. 
    When the muezzin fell silent after calling to Fajr prayer, and he could see the dawn, and the muezzin came to him, he would get up and pray two 
    short rak’ahs, then he would lie down on his right side until the muezzin came to him to recite the iqaamah.” 
According to some reports, he lay down before 
    the adhaan for Fajr. Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on Muslim: 
What is correct is that he lay down after the 
    Sunnah of Fajr, because of the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah who said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “When any one of you has prayed two rak’ahs of Fajr, let him lie down on his right side.” (Narrated by Abu Dawood and al-Tirmidhi with an isnaad 
    which is saheeh according to the conditions of al-Bukhaari and Muslim. Al-Tirmidhi said it is a saheeh hasan hadeeth). This saheeh hadeeth is 
    clear about the matter of his lying down. With regard to the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah which says that he lay down before and after Fajr, and the 
    hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas which says that he lay down before, there is no contradiction, because the fact that he lay down before does not mean that 
    he did not lie down afterwards as well. There are some reports which say that on some occasions he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) did not lie down afterwards, which could be taken to demonstrate that it is permissible not to do it. That would apply if it were proven that 
    he did not do it but it was not proven. Perhaps he used to lie down both before and after. If the ahaadeeth say that he told them to lie down 
    after praying and that he himself did that, this proves the point.  If it is possible to reconcile the ahaadeeth, it is not permissible to reject 
    any of them, and it is possible to reconcile them in two ways, one of which we have mentioned, which is that he lay down both before and 
    afterwards. The second is that he did not lie down afterwards on some occasions, to demonstrate that it is permissible not to do so. And Allaah 
    knows best. 
Al-Haafiz said: 
Some of the salaf were of the view that this 
    is permissible at home but not in the mosque. This was narrated from Ibn ‘Umar, and was regarded as a strong  opinion by some of our shaykhs, 
    because it is not narrated that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did this in the mosque. It was narrated that Ibn 
    ‘Umar used to throw pebbles at those who did this in the mosque; this was narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said, after discussing 
    the differences of scholarly opinion concerning this lying down: 
The correct view is that which was expressed 
    by Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah], that if a person is tired after his tahajjud (prayers at night), he may rest by lying down on his right side. 
    This is on condition that there is no fear of his being overtaken by sleep that will make him miss the prayer. If there is such a fear then he 
    should not sleep. 
Sharh Riyaadh al-Saaliheen, 
    3/287 
The reason for this lying down is to rest if 
    one is tired after praying qiyaam al-layl (naafil prayers at night), so that one's energy will be renewed for Fajr prayer. Based on this, what 
    some people do by lying down for less than a minute, as mentioned in the question, do not achieve the purpose, and it goes against the Sunnah 
    because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to lie down until the muezzin came to him to say the iqaamah just before 
    the prayer.

Then he came to him a second time and said something similar and he told him not to marry her. Then he came to him a third time and said something similar and he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Marry the one who is loving and fertile, for I will be proud of your great numbers.” 
Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2050; al-Nasaa’i, 3227; classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) in Adaab al-Zafaaf, p. 132. 
There are two ways of knowing whether a woman will be fertile: 
1 – By looking at her mother and sisters 
2 – If she has been married before; that will be known from her previous marriage.  
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeem Abaadi said in ‘Awn al-Ma’bood (6/33): Marry the one who is loving, means, the one who loves her husband; and the one who is fertile, is the one who bears a lot of children. 
It may be understood from this that if the one who is fertile is not loving, it is not recommended to marry her, and if the one who is loving is not fertile, then the purpose of marriage, which is to increase the numbers of the ummah by bearing many children, will not be achieved. These two qualities may be known in the case of virgins from their relatives, because relatives are usually similar, physically and in attitude, to one another.

    him) commanded us to pay sadaqah (i.e., zakaah) on that which we had 
    prepared for sale. 

    This is also the view of the majority of scholars, and it is 
    correct. 

    Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 
    9/331 
It makes no difference if 
    the land is owned entirely by the one who is paying zakaah or if it is 
    shared out as when many people hold shares in it. 

    The scholars of the Standing Committee also said: 

    The Standing Committee was asked about zakaah on lands that 
    are owned through shares – is the ruling on these the same as the ruling on 
    trade goods or the ruling on real estate?  

    They replied: 

    If a person acquires real estate with the intention of 
    trading it (selling it later on to make a profit), whether it is shared or 
    he owns it outright, then the ruling is the same as the ruling on trade 
    goods, and zakaah must be paid on its value if it reaches the nisaab 
    (minimum threshold at which zakaah becomes due), when one year has passed. 
    The way in which the value is to be worked out is to estimate its value at 
    the end of the year, and this estimate must be done by one who has 
    experience in that field.  And Allaah knows best.

32680,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/32680,She prayed when she was junub by mistake – does she have to repeat the prayers?,"I prayed Fajr and Zuhr and ‘Asr without having done ghusl for janaabah because I forgot. After having a bath at Maghrib time I repeated these prayers before praying Maghrib. Then my husband told me that it is essential to have the right intention (niyyah) for doing ghusl, so I did ghusl and prayed ‘Isha’ and I did not repeat the rest of the prayers. Are my prayers from Fajr to Maghrib valid? What do I have to do?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    Whoever prays when he is not in a state of tahaarah (purity) 
    has to purify himself and repeat the prayer, according to scholarly 
    consensus, even if he forgot. Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmoo’ (2/78): 
The Muslims are 
    unanimously agreed that it is haraam to pray when one is impure, and they 
    are unanimously agreed that the prayer is not valid whether he knew that he 
    was impure or was unaware of it or forgot. But if he prayed not knowing it 
    or having forgotten it, there is no sin on him; if he knew that he was 
    impure and that it is haraam to pray when one is impure, then he has 
    committed a grave sin. 

    Secondly: 

    Ghusl following janaabah is not valid unless one has the 
    intention of doing ghusl, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “Actions are but by intentions.” Narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari, 1; Muslim, 1907. 

    The site of the intention is the heart; it is not required to 
    speak it out loud. 

    If you remembered that you were in a state of janaabah before 
    you took a bath at Maghrib time, and you took a bath for that reason and 
    repeated the prayers that you had offered when you were junub, then that 
    ghusl is valid because the intention was there. You did well to repeat the 
    prayers as this is what is required of you. 

    But if you did not remember that you were in a state of 
    janaabah until after you had had the bath, and you took a bath in order to 
    clean yourself or to cool yourself down, for example, then this bath did not 
    take away the janaabah because there was no intention to do so. In that case 
    you have to repeat the ghusl and the prayers. You repeated the ghusl, so all 
    that remains for you to do is to repeat the prayers. So repeat Fajr, Zuhr, 
    ‘Asr and Maghrib.

32689,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/32689,Is the wife’s sister considered to be a mahram?,Is the wife’s sister considered to be a mahram?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.The wife’s sister is considered to be a “stranger” (non-mahram) to her sister’s husband, so it is not permissible for him to look at her, or be alone with her, or to shake hands with her. Some people think that because she is forbidden in marriage to the husband that it is permissible to look at her and be alone with her and shake hands with her, but this is wrong. What is meant by forbidden in marriage here is that it is not permissible for a man to be married to a woman and her sister at the same time; similarly it is forbidden to be married to a woman and her paternal aunt or a woman and her maternal aunt at the same time. The prohibition on being married to a woman and her sister at the same time is mentioned in the Qur’aan. Allah has stated that among the women who are forbidden in marriage, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and two sisters in wedlock at the same time” [al-Nisa’ 4:23]
And it is stated in the saheeh Sunnah that it is forbidden to be married to a woman and her paternal aunt at the same time, or to be married to a woman and her maternal aunt at the same time.  Narrated by al-Bukhari, 4821; Muslim, 1408. 
So what is forbidden is to be married to two sisters at the same time, and the wife’s sister is not forbidden to the husband for marriage in a permanent sense. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about a woman who lives with her married sister and does not wear hijab in front of her sister’s husband. She says that she is temporarily a mahram (forbidden in marriage) to him. What is your response to that? 
He replied: 
This woman is confused. It is not permissible for her sister’s husband to marry her so long as her sister is with him, so she is forbidden in marriage to him for a certain period, not permanently. But her understanding is mistaken because those who are forbidden in marriage for a certain period are not mahrams. 
The mahrams are those to whom marriage is permanently forbidden either because of blood ties or for a permissible reason, namely ties of marriage or ties created through breastfeeding. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And marry not women whom your fathers married, except what has already passed; indeed it was shameful and most hateful, and an evil way.
23. Forbidden to you (for marriage) are: your mothers, your daughters, your sisters, your father’s sisters, your mother’s sisters, your brother’s daughters, your sister’s daughters, your foster mothers who gave you suck, your foster milk suckling sisters, your wives’ mothers, your stepdaughters under your guardianship, born of your wives to whom you have gone in — but there is no sin on you if you have not gone in them (to marry their daughters), — the wives of your sons who (spring) from your own loins, and two sisters in wedlock at the same time, except for what has already passed; verily, Allah is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful”
[al-Nisa’ 4:22-23]
Allah did not say, “And the sisters of your wives.” What is forbidden is to be married to two sisters at the same time. 
Based on this, we say to the sister of the questioner, who says that her sister speaks to her sister’s husband and does not wear hijab in front of him, and says that they are temporary mahrams, that this is a mistaken notion and is not correct. This is not the matter of being temporary mahrams, because what is forbidden is to be married to two sisters at the same time, as Allah says: “and two sisters in wedlock at the same time”. The case of the wife’s sister is not as the questioner understands it.

32690,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/32690,"What is the status of the hadeeth, “No man is scratched by a thorn…”?","What is the status of this hadeeth? 
It was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No man is scratched by a thorn, or stumbles, or has a twitching in a vein, except for a sin, and what Allaah forgives is greater.” 
Does this mean that everything that happens to a person is because of his sin? I read this in Tafseer al-Qurtubi, and I looked in Saheeh al-Bukhaari and Fath al-Baari, but I could not find it.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
This hadeeth was narrated by al-Tabari in al-Tafseer, 5/175; and by al-Bayhaqi in Shu’ab al-Eemaan, 7/153; from the mursal hadeeth of Qataadah. 
A mursal report is one which is narrated by a Taabi’i from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), with no narrator in between. This is one of the categories of da’eef (weak) hadeeth. So this hadeeth has a weak isnaad, as was mentioned by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah, 1796. 
Secondly: 
The meaning of the hadeeth is sound and is supported by other evidence from the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). The calamities that befall a man may be as the result of sin that he has committed, so this calamity may be expiation for that sin. 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Whatever of good reaches you, is from Allaah, but whatever of evil befalls you, is from yourself. And We have sent you (O Muhammad) as a Messenger to mankind, and Allaah is Sufficient as a Witness”
[al-Nisa’ 4:79] 
“And whatever of misfortune befalls you, it is because of what your hands have earned. And He pardons much”
[al-Shoora 42:30]
Ibn Katheer said in his Tafseer (1/529): 
“Whatever of good reaches you, is from Allaah” means, it is by the grace, bounty, kindness and mercy of Allaah. “but whatever of evil befalls you, is from yourself” means, it is because of your own actions. This is like the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And whatever of misfortune befalls you, it is because of what your hands have earned. And He pardons much”
[al-Shoora 42:30]
Al-Saddi, al-Hasan al-Basri, Ibn Jurayj and Ibn Zayd said: “is from yourself” means, because of your sin. Qataadah said concerning this verse, “is from yourself” means, as a punishment to you, O son of Adam, for your sin. 
Thirdly: 
The calamities that befall a believer in this world raise him in status and expiate for his sins. 
Hence the believer should accept whatever calamities Allaah decrees for him, and should realize that this is good for him. 
It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her), the wife of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no calamity that befalls a Muslim but Allaah expiates (sin) thereby, even a thorn that pricks him.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5640; Muslim, 2572. 
Muslim (2572) narrated that ‘Aa’ishah said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “There is nothing that befalls a believer, not even a thorn that pricks him, but Allaah will record a hasanah (good deed) for him thereby, or erase from him a sin.”

I hope that you can help me.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Entering chat rooms may lead to many evil consequences, hence we do not advise 
    anyone to focus his concern and energy on that. Many of the youth have been tempted to use chat rooms to get to know girls, so it starts with 
    da’wah and ends with becoming preoccupied with and tempted by these girls, and some of them have even committed fornication. 
Our website has heard of many sad stories, some from girls who have repented, and 
    some from the wives of some righteous men whose lives have been changed by these chat rooms. 
Hence we think that this matter should be left to some daa’iyahs to carry out in 
    an organized and collective fashion, because of the fear of evil consequences that start with chatting for the purpose of da’wah and end – usually 
    – with evils that are not permitted in Islam, such as infatuation and what it leads to. The Shaytaan has ways that he follows with those whom he 
    wishes to tempt, so we must beware of these things. 
We appreciate your protective jealousy (gheerah) with regard to people’s falling 
    into sin, and your keenness to call people to Allaah, but we would prefer you to direct your energies towards general writing on bulletin boards 
    and delivering khutbahs and teaching in the mosques and in public places. This is more beneficial and is better for you – in sha Allaah – than
