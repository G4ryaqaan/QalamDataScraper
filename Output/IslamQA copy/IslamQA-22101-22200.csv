He didn’t want anyone else to have me & thinking it would get her out of his system but it did not and he has been looking for her since and now they have found each other. He has giving the girl our mailing address as well and she has used it. I spoke with her asking if she would not bother with him. She told me he is a free man. I know he is allowed up to 4 wives. He has his name on a list with the high school graduated from so that other people can get in touch with him. So far 3 females has found him. I would like to know if it is okay for my husband to have female friends and they are all non-Muslims. Please help me. Sometimes I feel he doesn’t want me for the right reasons. We are overseas and she is in the states & now he wants to go back.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Allaah has made marriage one of His signs, 
    and has created love and compassion between the spouses, and He has made each spouse a garment for the other. The basic principle regarding 
    marriage is that it should be lasting: it is not permissible for either spouse to go against the purpose of marriage. Your husband should have 
    feared Allaah and had a good intention before embarking on marriage. So long as he married you with your consent and all the conditions of 
    marriage were fulfilled, then your marriage is valid and there is no doubt about it. 
It is also haraam for him to establish 
    relationships with women who are “strangers” to him [i.e., non-mahrams] and to correspond with them, so how about if that correspondence also 
    involves obscene words such as words of love and romance? See the answer to question no,
    23349. 
With regard to yourself, why don’t you speak 
    frankly with your husband and advise him? That may bring him back to his senses. Or you could ask some good people to intervene and advise him. 
If he cannot forget her, then it is 
    permissible for him, according to Islam, to marry her if she is a kitaabi [one of the People of the Book, i.e., a Jew or a Christian], subject to 
    the condition that he repents from having had haraam relationships and he comes back to being chaste. 
In that way he will protect himself from 
    falling into haraam actions. Allaah permits Muslim men to marry chaste women from among the People of the Book (Jews and Christians). 
You have to be patient and not hasten to 
    separate from him. Perhaps if you stay with him and are patient with him, and keep on advising him, that may be the cause of his being guided and 
    coming back to his senses.  
If he insists on separating and continuing to 
    do haraam things, then you should not feel bad about it and should not be keen to stay with him. Whatever the case, we ask Allaah to guide us and 
    you and him and give us strength.

22102,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22102,Doing one prayer straight after the other when combining two prayers,What is the ruling on doing one prayer straight after the other? Because they delay for a while which may be considered to be an interruption between the two prayers when they join two prayers. What is the ruling on that?,,,"Praise be to Allah.When joining prayers during the time of the first of the two prayers, they should be prayed one after the other. It is OK to have what is regarded as a short break between them, as it was proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did that. And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Pray as you have seen me praying.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, Kitaab al-Adhaan, 631). The correct view is that the intention (niyyah) [i.e., having the intention to combine the prayers before starting the first prayer] is not a condition. But with regard to joining prayers during the time of the second of the two prayers, there is more leeway, because the second prayer is being performed at its right time. But it is better to pray them one after the other, following the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).

my question is regarding marriage .  
my parents have accepted a proposal from a family but now they r delaying in fixing up dates . although the man's family wants evrything to b done quickly but my parents r taking a lot of time. so what is the ruling on delaying of wedding when once everything has been finalized.",,,"Praise be to Allah.We thank you for your kind words about our site, and we ask Allaah to bless us and you with beneficial knowledge and righteous deeds.  
If the situation is as you say, with your father having agreed and with the woman’s family being prepared, then everything is in place and there is no reason to delay this marriage. 
Rather you should hasten to proceed with it, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “O young men, whoever among you can afford to get married, let him do so, and whoever cannot afford it, let him fast, for that will be a shield for him.” (Agreed upon, from the hadeeth of Ibn Mas’ood, may Allaah be pleased with him. Al-Bukhaari, 4778; Muslim, 1400). 
But your father may have some reasons for delaying the marriage, which he may not want to tell you.  So you should be patient and seek reward for that. You should also tell them of the virtue of hastening this good thing, because it will help you to lower your gaze and guard your chastity, even if that is done by doing the marriage contract and delaying consummation of the marriage, that is better than leaving it as an engagement. 
You should note that the fiancé (khaatib) is still a non-mahram to his fiancée (makhtoobah), and it is not permissible for him to do any more than look at her as much as the fiancé is permitted to look. But if he does the marriage contract with her, she becomes his wife and it is permissible for him to so everything with her that married people do, but it is better for him not to have intercourse with her until the marriage is announced, so as to ward off mischief, and in acknowledgement of the prevalent custom.

And with regard to memorizing Qur’aan – if a person memorizes Qur’aan then forgets it, is there any warning of punishment in this case? How should one retain what one has memorized?",,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen 
          (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked this question and he replied 
          as follows: 
 
          The sciences of the Qur’aan vary. Every 
          mufassir who comments on the Qur’aan focuses on one aspect of these 
          sciences. It is impossible for one tafseer to encompass all aspects 
          of the Qur’aan. 
 
          Among the scholars are those who focus 
          on the theoretical aspects of tafseer, like al-Zammakhshaari and others. 
          But I think that he should think of the meaning of the aayah himself 
          first – i.e., he should think of the meaning of the aayah – then he 
          should check what the scholars said concerning it, because this will 
          help him to be strong in Tafseer and not dependent on others. From the 
          time when the Messenger 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was sent until the present, 
          the word of Allaah has always been “In the plain Arabic language” (cf. 
          al-Shu’araa 26:195 – interpretation of the meaning). 
 
          It is necessary to refer to the tafseer 
          of the Sahaabah, because they had the greatest understanding of its 
          meanings; then to the books of the mufassireen among the Taabi’een. 
          But despite that no one can ever encompass all the meanings of the words 
          of Allaah. 
 
          What I think is the best way is for a 
          person to think of what an aayah means, then to refer to the words of 
          the scholars. If he finds that his view is the same, that will help 
          him to become good in tafseer and make it easy for him. If he finds 
          that his view is different, then he should follow that which is correct. 
 
          With regard to memorizing the Qur’aan, 
          the way in which it is memorized varies from one person to another. 
          Some people memorize Qur’aan aayah by aayah, i.e., they memorize one 
          aayah, reading it two or three times, then they work at it until they 
          have memorized it, then they memorize the following aayah, and so on 
          until they have completed one-eighth or one-quarter of the juz’ and 
          so on. Other people read the whole one-eighth of a juz’  and repeat 
          it until they have memorized it. In such matters we cannot lay down 
          a general rule, so we tell people, use whatever method suits you to 
          memorize Qur’aan. 
 
          But it is important that you should know 
          what you have memorized when you want to go back to it. The best way 
          that I have seen is that if a person memorizes something on one day, 
          he should read it again early the following morning. This is a great 
          help in remembering what he memorized on the previous day. This is something 
          that I have done myself and it was a great help in memorizing properly. 
 
          With regard to the warning against one 
          who forgets, Imaam Ahmad said, “How severe the warning is,” i.e., against 
          one who memorizes an aayah then forgets it. What is meant here is the 
          one who neglects it until he forgets it. But if a person forgets it 
          because of some natural reason or because of duties which he got involved 
          in, which kept him away from revising what he mad memorized, in this 
          case he is not guilty of sin. “Allaah burdens not a person beyond 
          his scope” [al-Baqarah 2:286 – interpretation of the meaning]. 
 
          It was reported that the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) led his companions in prayer, 
          and he forgot an aayah. One of his companions reminded him of it after 
          the prayer. He said, “Why did you not remind me of it sooner?” But the 
          one who is negligent concerning that or who turns away from it is undoubtedly 
          a loser and deserves to be guilty of sin But the one who forgets it 
          because he became involved in duties which Allaah has enjoined upon 
          him, or who forgot it for some natural reason, is not guilty of anything.","From Fataawa al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen, Kitaab al-‘Ilm, p. 136"

Why is renting wombs haram?


Renting wombs is a western innovation


Is surrogacy allowed in Islam?","Praise be to Allah.Is renting wombs haram?
Shaykh ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Abd al-Rahman al-Jibrin answered this question as follows:
“We say that taking an egg from a woman, fertilizing it with her husband’s sperm, then implanting it in the womb of another woman , is something innovated and reprehensible. 
The scholars have not spoken of it previously and it is not narrated that any of the scholars or imams of this ummah permitted that, or that it crossed their minds, or that they were asked about any such thing, even though the means and the motive existed that may have called for such a thing. 
This is something that has come up recently, within the last few years, where the idea of renting a womb has been made attractive (by the Shaytan) to some people and they say there is nothing wrong with it and so on. Undoubtedly this is haram, primarily because Allah has commanded us to guard our chastity, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And those who guard their chastity (i.e. private parts, from illegal sexual acts) Except from their wives or (the slaves) that their right hands possess, for then, they are free from blame.” [al-Muminun 23:5-6]
 So Allah has forbidden us to engage in sexual activity with anyone except our wives and female slaves, i.e., having intercourse with them (female slaves) on the basis of possession.
Why is renting wombs haram?
Allah tells us that man is enjoined to protect his lineage and his children. Undoubtedly this womb-renting will lead to confusion of lineage and not knowing who the father or mother is. This confusion of lineage will lead to disputes between the original wife and the woman whose womb is rented, and it will not be known to whom the child belongs. Even if we say that he belongs to one of them, the matter still will not be certain. Hence we advise women to keep away from such things.  
Moreover, this undoubtedly requires looking at `awrahs and at the private parts which it is forbidden to see, and it also requires collecting sperm and extracting the eggs and placing them in other wombs. All of that is not allowed in Shari`ah, indeed it comes under the prohibition mentioned in the ayah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts).” [al-Nur 24:30]
What is meant is to protect them by covering them so that no one will see the `awrah of another. This is the way of Islam and we pay no attention to those who deviate and go against that, and permit this borrowing and this renting of wombs, the consequences of which will undoubtedly be disastrous.”
Renting wombs is a western innovation
“Renting wombs is one of the innovations of western civilization, which is a purely materialistic civilization which does not give any weight to moral values and principles. The issue is not things that may affect inherited characteristics or confuse lineage; that is not the point of the shar’i ruling. Whether that leads to any effect on inherited characteristics or not, whether that results in confusion of lineage or not, it does not matter, because the shar’i ruling forbidding this innovation is based on something else, which is that the womb is a part of a woman’s private parts and the private parts (i.e., sexual relations) are not permissible except through the shar’i contract whose conditions are fully met. So the womb is exclusively for the husband who is married to that woman according to a valid marriage contract, and no one else has any right to use it for an alien pregnancy. If the woman who rents out her womb is not married to that husband, then she is permitting her private parts and her womb to a man who is a stranger to her; she is not permissible for him and he is not permissible for her. Even if this is not full-scale zina (adultery), it is still definitely haram because it is enabling a man who is a stranger to her (i.e., not married to her) to put his semen in her womb.” (Dr. ‘Abd al-‘Azim al-Mat’ani, al-Azhar University) 
The fetus is nourished and is influenced by the womb and the environment that surrounds him. Bad habits on the part of the surrogate mother may lead to deformity of the fetus, such as smoking, drinking alcohol, etc. Then what if the doctors discover some physical deformity in the fetus before birth and try to treat that by means of surgical intervention? Will the surrogate mother allow that? Will she put her life at risk for the sake of a child who does not belong to her? Moreover, there are some women who become sick as a result of pregnancy, suffering such diseases as a sudden rise in the level of blood sugar, or a rise in blood pressure, or toxemia, some of which may take the life of the pregnant woman and which require medical intervention to sacrifice the fetus in order to save the life of the pregnant woman. How would the surrogate mother and the original mother work this out? How are we to deal with the ethical, legal, social and psychological problems that result from that? Therefore we can reach only one conclusion, which is that the mother who carries the pregnancy can only be the original mother, the child should be attributed to the marriage bed, and that she should conceive, nourish her fetus and give birth to it. 
Is surrogacy allowed in Islam?
Saying that renting wombs is like hiring wet-nurses has no basis in truth, for a wet-nurse breastfeeds a child whose lineage is known, and she can stop breastfeeding him when she wants or when the original mother wants, if she feels that there is any danger. 
Moreover, in the relationship between a husband and wife there is no room for any third party, no matter who he or she is, not for renting a womb or for donating sperm or donating eggs . Because of such things innumerable problems have arisen in western societies. In Britain an original mother gave twenty thousand pounds to a surrogate mother in return for renting her womb for nine months. When that time was over, the surrogate mother demanded many times that amount from the original mother in exchange for giving up possession of the child. So if this door is opened it will bring us innumerable legal and social problems.” (Prof. Jamal Abu’l-Surur – Dean of Medicine, al-Azhar)

In the city where he died there was no graveyard set aside exclusively for the Muslims. Should he be buried in the Christian graveyard or what?

          If there is no graveyard for the Muslims, then when a

22147,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22147,"Is it necessary in order to denounce evil that it be removed completely, or is it sufficient to reduce it","If I want to denounce some evil, but we cannot remove it completely but we are able to reduce it, should we get involved for that purpose? Or should we say that we have to either remove it completely or not do anything at all?",,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          The correct view is that we have to remove evil as much 
          as we can. Our efforts should be aimed primarily at removing it completely. 
          If we are not able to do that, but we can reduce it or reduce some of 
          its effects, then the basic principles of sharee’ah dictate that we 
          should do that, especially since we are living at a time when he evildoershave 
          the upper hand and those who seek to enjoin what is good and forbid 
          what is evil and to call people to Allaah are unable to achieve all 
          that they want to do. We can at least reduce the effects of evil; if 
          there is something that is difficult to remove, this is no excuse for 
          not doing what we can. We should not give up altogether on something 
          of which we can only do a part. Allaah does not burden any soul beyond 
          its scope, but we have to be certain about the basic principle in this 
          matter, which is that the daa’iyah (caller) who wants to enjoin what 
          is good and forbid what is evil should not be content with a partial 
          solution or accept a reduction of the evil when it is possible to eradicate 
          it completely. 
 
          Often those who enjoin what is good and forbid what is 
          evil are content to reduce the evil without striving to remove it… Like 
          the one who tells a woman who is showing a lot of her charms to non-mahram 
          men to cover all of that apart from the hands and face, even though 
          he is able to tell her to observe complete hijaab.
 
           And like the one who passes by someone who is playing 
          singing and music loud, and he tells him to turn down the sound of that 
          evil. 
 
          And like the one who is asked to teach women or girls, 
          and he sets down the condition that they should wear hijaab and not 
          speak in soft voices, even though he is able to demand that a screen 
          be placed between him and them so that they can hear his voice without 
          him seeing them. 
 
          Among the evidence concerning this matter that is mentioned 
          in the Qur’aan is what Moosa (peace be upon him) did with the calf which 
          the Children of Israel worshipped and were devoted to. He said: 
 
          “We will certainly burn it, and scatter its particles 
          in the sea”
 
          [Ta-Ha 20:97 – interpretation of the meaning]
 
          The Sunnah is what the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did with the masjid al-diraar 
          (a mosque built by way of harming and diselief, cf. al-Tawbah 9:107), 
          which had been built by the hypocrites. He ordered that it should be 
          burned after being detsroyed. 
 
          Al-Bukhaari and others narrated from the hadeeth of Ibn 
          Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) that he said, “The Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) entered Makkah on the day 
          of the Conquest, and there were three hundred and sixty idols around 
          the Ka’bah. He started hitting them with a stick that he had in his 
          hand, saying, ‘Truth has come and falsehood has vanished. Truth has 
          come and faslehood can neither create nor resurrect anything.” (Narrated 
          by al-Bukhaari). 
 
          Another example was narrated by al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh, 
          in the hadeeth of Jareer ibn ‘Abd-Allaah al-Bajali (may Allaah be pleased 
          with him) who said, “The Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to me, ‘Won't you relieve 
          me from Dhul-Khalasah?' I replied, 'Yes, (I will relieveyou).' So I went along with one hundred and fiftycavalry from the tribe of Ahmas who were skillful in ridinghorses. I used not to sit firmly on a horse, so I informedthe Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) of that, and he hit my chest 
          with hishand till I saw the marks of his hand 
          on my chest andhe said, ‘O Allah! Make him firm 
          and one who guidesothers and is guided (on the 
          right path).' Since then Ihave never fallen 
          from a horse. Dhul-l-Khalasah was ahouse in 
          Yemen belonging to the tribe of Jath’am andBajeelah, and in it there were idols which were worshipped, and 
          it was called al-ka'bah."" Jareer wentthere, 
          burnt it with fire and destroyed it.  
 
          When Jareer came to Yemen, there was a man who used to 
          tell fortunes and give good omens by casting arrows of divination. 
          Someone said to him, ""The 
          messenger of the Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is here, is present here 
          and if he should get hold of you, hewill chop 
          off your head."" One day while the man was usingthem (i.e. arrows of divination), Jareer stopped there andsaid to him, ""Break them (i.e. the arrows) and testifythat None has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, or else 
          I will chop off your head."" So the man brokethose 
          arrows and testified that none has the right to be 
          worshipped except Allah. Then Jareer sent a man calledAbu Artaa’ah from the tribe of Ahmas to the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) toconvey 
          the good news (that Dhul-Khalasah had been destroyed). So when the messenger reached the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), he said, ""O 
          Messenger of Allaah! By Him Who sent you with the Truth, I did not come 
          until I left it like a scabby camel."" Thenthe 
          Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)  said, “May 
          Allaah bless the horses of Ahmas and their men,”five 
          times.
 
          The relevant points in this hadeeth are two: what he 
          did to Dhul-Khalasah, and how he dealt with the one who used arrows 
          for fortune-telling etc. 
 
          And it says in al-Fath: “This hadeeth indicates 
          that it is prescribed in Islam to remove things by which people may 
          be tempted, be they buildings or other things, even if it is a person, 
          an animal or an inanimate object.” (8/73) 
 
          Another example is when Khaalid ibn al-Waleed (may Allaah 
          be pleased with him) was sent to al-‘Uzza and he cut down the three 
          gum-acacia trees and destroyed the house. When he told him what he had 
          done, the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told him that he had not 
          done anything. He told him to go back and find that naked woman with 
          dishevelled hair who was pouring dust on her head, and so he went back 
          and killed her with a sword… When he came back to the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and told him, the Messenger 
          of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “That was al-‘Uzza” 
          (Zaad al-Ma’aad, 3/414). 
 
          It was narrated from one of the salaf that he passed 
          by two boys who were playing in a hole in which there were pebbles with 
          which they were playing. He blocked it up and forbade them to go there. 
          Tafseer al-Qurtubi, 8/340 
 
          But if the one who is enjoing good and forbidding evil 
          is unable to remove the evil completely, then he should strive to reduce 
          it as much as possible. 
 
          Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, when 
          mentioning some of the lessons learned from the battle of Tabook, “We 
          also learn that places of sin in which Allaah and His Messenger are 
          disobeyed are to be burned and destroyed, as the Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) burned the masjid al-diraar 
          (a mosque built by way of harming and diselief, cf. al-Tawbah 9:107) 
          and commanded that it should be destroyed. This was a mosque in which 
          prayers were offered and the name of Allaah was mentioned, but it had 
          been built to cause harm and divide the believers, and as a refuge for 
          the hypocrites. In the case of places of this type, the ruler  
          has to put a stop to it, either by destroying it and burning it, or 
          by changing its appearance and using it for a different purpose. If 
          this was the case concerning a mosque built for harming and disbelief, 
          then places of shirk whose cutodians promote taking those inside them 
          as rivals to Allaah are even more deserving of being destroyed. The 
          same applies to places of sin and immorality, such as bars and places 
          of evil. ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab burned an entire village in which wine 
          was sold, and he burned the shop of Ruwayshid al-Thaqafi and called 
          him Fuwaysiq. [Ruwayshid comes from a word meaning “guided” and Fuwaysiq 
          comes from a word meaning “immoral.” – Translator].  And he burned 
          the fortress of Sa’d in which he was hiding away from people. The Messenger 
          of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) wanted to burn down the 
          houses of those who did not attend prayers in congregation or Jumu’ah 
          prayers; the only thing that kept him from doing that was the woman 
          and children who were not obliged to attend these prayers, as he told 
          us. (Zaad al-Ma’aad, 3/571-572)",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
22150,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22150,Dhikr and the Muslim Child,How can we teach our children the adhkaar (words of remembrance) to be recited every day and night?,,,"Praise be to Allah.A child can be taught, from the age of three or four, the adhkaar to be recited in the morning and evening, and when going to sleep, eating and drinking. If a child hears these adhkaar, and memorizes and recites them, this will form a strong bond between his soul and Allah, so his soul will develop and his nature will be sound and free of deviations. 
A family went on a trip to the countryside, and when they made a stop, their child went running around the countryside in joy. Then he quickly came back and asked his mother, “What is the dhikr that we should say in this place?” Of course, the dhikr he meant was that which was narrated from the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): Khawlah bint Hakeem (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say, ‘Whoever makes a stop whilst traveling, then says, “A’oodhu bi kalimaat Allah il-taammati min sharri ma khalaqa (I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allah from the evil of that which He has created),” then nothing will harm him until he moves on from that place.’” (Narrated by Muslim). 
This child realized that there are specific adhkaar that the Muslim should recite, some of them are connected to certain times, some to certain places, and so on. This child understood the real nature of the relationship with his Lord and realized that it is ongoing, because of what he had learned from his parents. If a child is brought up in such a manner, then he will be righteous, insha Allah, and he will have an influence on his friends and those with whom he is in contact.  
Another story about a child growing up remembering Allah and having a relationship with Him is that one day a small child who was just four years old came to his mother wearing new clothes that his thirteen-year-old sister had put on him. His mother said to him, “Let me teach you the du’aa’ for wearing new clothes.” The child said, “I have already said it.” The mother was surprised because she knew that the child had not yet learned this du’aa’. But the child told his mother, “My sister said the du’aa’ and I repeated it after her.” Look at the righteousness of this girl that had such an effect even on her little brother.","From Ummahaat qurba Abnaa’ihinna, p. 25"
22154,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22154,How to serve Islam,"I want to serve my religion, what should I do?",,,"Praise be to Allah.1 – You can serve Islam by having a correct resolve and sincere intention, for Allaah blesses an action that is done sincerely for His sake alone, even if it is little. Sincere devotion, if it becomes a constant feature of acts of worship and obedience, even if they are small or simple in the sight of the one who does them, makes them great in the sight of Allaah, so Allaah will forgive him for major sins because of that, as it says in the hadeeth about the piece of paper on which is written La ilaaha ill-Allaah. 
2 – You can serve Islam by knowing the right way and following it. The Straight Path means following the way of our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with regard to the principles, ways and means of da’wah and being patient in adhering to that, whilst treating people with kindness and compassion, because they are suffering from the disease of sin. 
3 – You can serve Islam by making the most of all available means and circumstances. This is a great blessing, for all means are permissible except those which have been forbidden by Allaah. So we call people to Allaah by all means prescribed in sharee’ah, whilst paying attention to the evidence of sharee’ah and correct etiquette. 
4 – You can serve Islam by giving precedence to that which is in the interests of Islam over your own whims and desires. Serving this religion means giving what is most precious of your money, effort, time, thought, etc. Have you not seen those who love sport (football or soccer) for example, how they devote their efforts, time and money to their beloved sport? But more is expected of you than that. 
5 – You can serve Islam by following in the footsteps of the scholars, daa’iyahs and reformers, having patience as your companion and putting up with tiredness and exhaustion. For you are doing a great act of worship which is the mission of the Prophets and Messengers and those who follow in their footsteps. 
6 – You can serve Islam by shunning laziness, weakness and apathy, for this religion is the religion of resolve, ambition and courage, and its call is only harmed by laziness or reckless ignorance. 
7 – You can serve Islam by connecting your heart to Allaah and reciting a lot of du’aa’ and prayers for forgiveness, and persisting in reading Qur’aan. There is nothing that is more effective in cleansing the heart and refreshing the soul, and making it active and energetic so that it will not get tired or bored, than remembering Allaah much and drawing nearer to Him by means of obeying Him and doing naafil (supererogatory) acts of worship. 
8 – You can serve Islam by forming bonds with scholars who practise what they preach, those who are known to be sincere and who are well established in jihad and supporting this religion. Marching under their banner and following their lead is very good and beneficial. 
9 – You can serve Islam by organizing your time on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. There are actions which should be done every day, others which should be done every week, and others which should be done every month or every year. 
For example, you should make da’wah to those whom you see every day and to those whom you see once a week. You may have a family gathering once a month, and there may be annual conferences, or journeys for Hajj or ‘Umrah once a year, and so on. 
10 – You can serve Islam by paying it some attention and giving it some of your time, thoughts and money, and making it your main concern. So when you stand up, it is for Islam; when you walk, it is for Islam; when you think, it is for Islam; when you give, it is for Islam; when you sit, it is for Islam. 
11 – you can serve Islam by hastening to contribute every time you find an opportunity to do good. Do not hesitate or delay or put it off.","From Kayfa akhdim al-Islam by ‘Abd al-Malik al-Qaasim, p. 18"

And why?",,,"Praise be to Allah.If a person joins the congregation when the imam is bowing, one of the following three scenarios applies: 
1-He says takbeerat al-ihram (saying “Allahu akbar” to start the prayer) whilst standing, then he bows whilst the imam is bowing. In this case he has caught up with the rak‘ah with the imam.
2-He says takbeerat al-ihram whilst the imam is bowing, but he bows after the imam has stood up from rukoo’. In this case he is not counted as having caught up with the rak‘ah with the imam, and he has to make it up.
3-He bows straightaway without saying takbeerat al-ihram. In this case his prayer is invalid, because he has omitted one of the pillars or essential parts of the prayer, which is takbeerat al-ihram.
“The fuqaha’ are agreed that whoever catches up with the imam in rukoo’ has caught up with the rak‘ah, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Whoever catches up with rukoo’ has caught up with the rak‘ah.’” This was narrated by Abu Dawood, and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel, 496; on p. 262 he said: one of the things that strengthens the hadeeth is the fact that the Sahaabah acted in accordance with this: 
1 – Ibn Mas’ood, who said: “Whoever does not catch up with the imam when he is bowing has not caught up with that rak‘ah.” Its isnaad is saheeh. 
2 – ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar, who said: “If you come when the imam is bowing, and you put your hands on you knees before the imam stands up, then you have caught up (with that rak‘ah).” Its isnaad is saheeh.
3 -  Zayd ibn Thaabit, who used to say: “Whoever catches up with the rak‘ah before the imam raises his head has indeed caught up with the rak‘ah.” Its isnaad is jayyid.

          The answer was that she should not be buried in the Muslim graveyard,

          and a kaafir together, and a kaafir cannot be buried with the Muslims

    1 – The girl’s family should look for a suitable man who can 
    make their daughter happy, and not seek to make excessive demands with 
    regard to the mahr. Rather they should look for a man who is religiously 
    committed and has a good character, who will be able to protect their 
    daughter’s religious commitment and chastity, and make her happy. 

    2 – Girls should not refuse to get married on the excuse that 
    they want to continue their education, so that they grow old and reach an 
    age where they can find no one to marry them. It is possible to come to an 
    agreement with their husbands that they will continue their education after 
    they get married. That is easy to do, praise be to Allaah. 
3 –  A girl should not regard a man who 
    proposes marriage to her when he already has a wife as unsuitable for her or 
    unable to make her happy. Many girls refuse to accept a man who is already 
    married, then time passes and they get too old and cannot find anyone to 
    marry them. But Islam and the Sunnah of the Prophet permit a Muslim man to 
    marry up to four women, on the condition that the man treat all his wives 
    fairly.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
22169,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22169,Ruling on differentiating between children in gift-giving,"Is it permissible for me to give something to one of my children and not to his brothers? What if that is done for a reason, such as his good attitude or his obeying his parents?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The scholars are agreed that it is prescribed in Islam to treat children fairly when it comes to gift-giving; they should not single out one or some of them and not give to others. 
Ibn Qudamah said in al-Mughni (5/666): “There is no dispute among the scholars that it is mustahabb to treat children equally and that it is makrooh to differentiate between them.” 
But there are differences of opinion concerning the ruling on differentiating between them. The strongest views in terms of evidence are two opinions – and Allah knows best. These two opinions are: 
1 – That it is absolutely haram to differentiate between them. This is the well known view among the Hanbalis (see Kashshaaf al-Qinaa’, 4/310; al-Insaaf, 7/138). This is also the view of the Zaahiriyyah (i.e., it is the same whether the differentiation is done for a reason or for no reason). 
2 – That it is haram to differentiate between them unless that is for a legitimate shar’i reason. This was narrated from Ahmad (al-Insaaf, 7/139) and was the view favoured by Ibn Qudaamah (al-Mughni, 5/664) and Ibn Taymiyah (Majmoo’ al-Fatawa, 31/295). 
The evidence quoted by both groups that say that it is haram to differentiate between one’s children is the report narrated by al-Bukhaari (2586) and Muslim (1623) from al-Nu’maan ibn Basheer, who said that his father brought him to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: “I have given this son of mine a slave who used to belong to me.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “have you given a similar gift to all of your children?” He said, “No.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Then take (your gift) back.” 
According to another version (al-Bukhaari, 2587; Muslim, 1623), al-Nu’maan ibn Basheer said: “My father gave me a gift of some of his wealth, but my mother, ‘Amrah bint Rawaahah, said, ‘I will not approve of it until you ask the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to bear witness to it.’ So my father went to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to ask him to bear witness to the gift. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him, ‘Have you done the same for all of your children?’ He said, ‘No.’ He said, ‘Fear Allah and treat your children justly.’ So my father came back and took back that gift.” 
According to a version narrated by Muslim, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “O Basheer, do you have any other children?” He said, “Yes.” He said, “Have you given all of them a similar gift?” He said, “No.” He said, “Then do not ask me to bear witness to this, for I do not bear witness to injustice.” The evidence in this hadeeth is clear: 
1 – The Prophet commanded justice, and a command implies that it is obligatory.
2 – He explained that showing preference to one child or singling him out to the exclusion of the others is falsehood and injustice, in addition to his refusal to bear witness to it and his commanding him to take back his gift. All of that indicates that differentiating between one’s children is haram.
They also referred to the evidence of common sense: 
Ibn Hajar mentioned in Fath al-Baari (5/214): 
Among the evidence of those who say that it is obligatory to treat one’s children equally is the fact that this (differentiating between children) is the first step that may lead to something haram, because cutting off family ties and disobeying one’s parents are two things which are haram, so that which leads to them may also be haram, and differentiating between one’s children is something that may lead to them. 
This is supported by something which was mentioned in a version narrated by Muslim (1623): “He [the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)] said, ‘Ask someone else to bear witness to this.’ Then he said: ‘Would you like your children to all honour you equally?’ He said, ‘Of course.’ He said, ‘Then do not do this.’” 
Further evidence is the fact that preferring some of them to others generates enmity and hatred between them, and also between them and their parents, so that is not allowed (al-Mughni, 5/664); this meaning is similar to that mentioned above. 
Those who favoured the second opinion, that it is permissible to differentiate between one’s children when there is a need, a reason or an excuse, quoted as evidence the hadeeth narrated by Maalik in al-Muwatta’, with his isnaad from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said that Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq had given her as a gift twenty wisq of his wealth, but when he was on his deathbed he said, “By Allah, O my daughter, there is no one whom I would like to see rich after I die more than you, and there is no one whom it hurts me to see poor after I die than you. I had given you twenty wisq, and if you have already gone and collected them, then they are yours, otherwise whatever I leave is to be divided among all my heirs, who are your two brothers and your two sisters, so divide it amongst yourselves according to the Book of Allah…”  
Ibn Hajar said in al-Fath (5/215): its isnaad is saheeh. 
The evidence from this hadeeth, is as Ibn Qudaamah mentioned, “It may be that Abu Bakr gave it only to ‘Aa’ishah because she was in need and was unable to earn a living, even though she enjoyed a unique status as one of the Mothers of the Believers, and other virtues.”
(Adapted from al-Mughni, 5/665) 
As justification for Abu Bakr’s action, al-Haafiz said in al-Fath (2/215): “ ‘Urwah said concerning the story of ‘Aa’ishah that her brothers and sisters had agreed to that.”
(Kitaab al-‘Adl bayna al-Awlaad, p. 22 ff) 
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said that it is haram in absolute terms in Ighaathat al-Lahfaan, 1/540. He said: “If there were no clear saheeh Sunnah reports that disallowed that, then by analogy and based on the principles of sharee’ah and its concern for people’s interests and to protect them from evil, it would have to be haram.” 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) stated that it is absolutely forbidden to show preference to some of one’s children over others, and that it is obligatory to treat them all equally, males and females alike, in accordance with their shares of inheritance, unless they give permission and are adults of sound mind. (al-Fatawa al-Jaami’ah li’l-Mar’ah al-Muslimah, 3/1115, 1116) 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: it is not permissible for a man to give some of his sons preferential treatment over others, but he may differentiate between males and females, giving the males double what he gives the females, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Fear Allah and treat your children fairly.” So if he gives one of his sons 100 dirhams, he has to give the other sons 100 dirhams each as well, and give the girls 50 dirhams each, or else take back the money that he gave to the first son. This that we have mentioned is to be applied in cases other than the spending which is obligatory; with regard to obligatory spending, he should give each one whatever he needs. So if it so happens that one of his sons needs to get married, and he gets him married and gives him the mahr because the son is not able to pay the mahr, then in this case he does not have to give all the other sons the same as he gave to the one who needed to get married, because getting one’s children married is part of spending on them. Here I want to draw attention to something that some people do out of ignorance, which is when a man has sons who have reached marriageable age, he gets them married, and he has other children who are still small, he makes a will saying that in the event of his death, they should be given money equal to that which was spent on the adult children. This is haram and is not permissible because this will is a will that gives something to an heir, and willing something to an heir is haram, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has given everyone his due, so there is no will for an heir.” (This version narrated by Abu Dawood, 3565; al-Tirmidhi, 2/16 and others. The isnaad of this version was classed as hasan by al-Albaani, and the version “There is no will for an heir” was classed as saheeh in al-Irwa’, 6/87). So if he says, “I am leaving this money for them in my will because I got their brothers married for a similar amount,” we say that if these young children reach marriageable age before you die, then get them married for the same amount of money as you got their brothers married, but if they do not reach that age (before you die) then you do not have to get them married.

Joking should not involve any element of making fun of Islam . 

That is one of the things that nullify a person’s Islam. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“If you ask them (about this), they declare: ‘We were only talking idly and joking.’ Say: ‘Was it at Allah, and His Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) and His Messenger  that you were mocking?’ Make no excuse; you disbelieved after you had believed” [Al-Tawbah 9:65-66]
Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
“Making fun of Allah , His Signs and His Messenger is disbelief and the one who does that disbelieves thereby after he had believed.” 
The same applies to making fun of some Sunnahs, an action which is widespread, such as making fun of the beard and the hijab, or of shortening one’s garment, etc. 
Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymin said in al-Majmu’ al-Thameen, 1/63:
 “The matters of Divine Lordship, Prophethood, Revelation and religion are sacred matters which are to be venerated. It is not permissible for anyone to show disrespect towards them, whether by mocking them to make others laugh or to poke fun at them. If anyone does that, he is a kafir, because this is indicative of his disrespect towards Allah and His messengers, Books and Laws. Whoever does that has to repent to Allah for what he has done, because that is a kind of hypocrisy. So he has to repent to Allah, seek His forgiveness, mend his ways and develop fear of Allah, veneration towards Him and love for Him in his heart. And Allah is the Source of strength.”

The jokes should only be truthful. 

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Woe to the one who tells lies to make people laugh, woe to him.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud) 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) warned against this kind of behaviour which some jokers are accustomed to: “A man may say something to make his companions laugh, and he will fall into Hell as far as the Pleiades because of it.” (Narrated by Ahmad). 

You should not scare people. 

Especially those who are very energetic or strong, or who are holding a weapon or a piece of iron, or who take advantage of the darkness and people’s weakness to use that as a means of scaring and alarming them. It was narrated that Abu Layla said: “The Companions of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said that they were travelling with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and a man among them fell asleep. Some of them got a rope and tied him up, and he got scared. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘It is not permissible for a Muslim to frighten another Muslim.’” (Narrated by Abu Dawud) 

You should not mock people by winking behind their backs or making snide remarks. 

People vary in their ability to understand things and in their characters. Some weak people, those who like to make fun of others and wink behind their backs or make snide remarks, may find a person to be an object of fun for them and the butt of their jokes – Allah forbid. Allah has forbidden such behaviour in the ayah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Let not a group scoff at another group, it may be that the latter are better than the former. Nor let (some) women scoff at other women, it may be that the latter are better than the former. Nor defame one another, nor insult one another by nicknames. How bad is it to insult one’s brother after having Faith.” [Al-Hujurat 49:11]
Ibn Kathir said in his Tafsir: 
“What is meant here is looking down on them, belittling them or making fun of them. This is haram and is counted as one of the characteristics of the hypocrites.” 
Some people make fun of a person’s appearance, manner of walking or vehicle. But there is the fear that Allah may requite the one who makes fun of others because of that. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Do not express malicious joy towards your brother’s misfortune, for Allah may have mercy on him and you may be stricken by the thing you made fun of.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi) 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) warned against mocking people and hurting their feelings, because that is the path that leads to hatred and grudges. He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The Muslim is the brother of another Muslim, he does not wrong him, let him down or look down upon him. Taqwa (piety, awareness and fear of Allah) is here” – and he pointed to his chest three times – “It is sufficient evil for a man to look down upon his Muslim brother. Every Muslim is sacred to another Muslim, his blood, his property and his honour.” (Narrated by Muslim) 

The jokes should not be excessive. 

Some people joke too much and it becomes a habit for them. This is the opposite of the serious nature which is the characteristic of the believers. Joking is a break, a rest from ongoing seriousness and striving; it is a little relaxation for the soul. ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Aziz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Fear joking, for it is folly and generates grudges.” 
Imam al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The kind of joking which is forbidden is that which is excessive and persistent, for it leads to too much laughter and hardening of the heart, it distracts from remembrance of Allah, and it often leads to hurt feelings, generates hatred and causes people to lose respect and dignity. But whoever is safe from such dangers, then that which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to do is permissible for him.” 

You should acknowledge people’s status. 

Some people may joke with everyone indiscriminately, but scholars and the elderly have rights, so you have to be aware of the character of the person with whom you are dealing. You should not joke with ignorant people, fools or people whom you do not know. 
With regard to this matter, ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Aziz said: “Fear joking, for it undermines chivalry and manliness.” 
Sa’d ibn Abi Waqqas said: “Set a limit to your jokes, for going to extremes makes you lose respect and incites the foolish against you.” 

The amount of joking should be like the amount of salt in one’s food. 

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not laugh too much, for laughing too much deadens the heart.” (Sahih al-Jami’, 7312) 
‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Whoever laughs too much or jokes too much loses respect, and whoever persists in doing something will be known for it.” 
So beware of joking, for it “causes a person to lose face after he was thought of as respectable, and it brings him humiliation after esteem.” 

Joking should not involve backbiting. 

This is a foul sickness. Some people think that they can talk about others, and say that this is by way of joking, but it is included in the hadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “[Backbiting is] your mentioning about your brother something that he dislikes.” (Narrated by Muslim) 

You should choose appropriate times for joking. 

Such as when you are taking a trip in the countryside, or attending a party in the evening, or when meeting a friend, you may relax and enjoy some gentle anecdotes, nice stories or light jokes, in order to generate friendship and instill happiness in the heart; or when family problems are taking their toll and one of the spouses is angry, some gentle joking may relieve the tension and cheer people up. 
A man said to Sufyan ibn ‘Uyaynah (may Allah be pleased with him), “Joking is not right, it is to be denounced.” He replied, “Rather it is Sunnah, but only for those who know how to do it and do it at the appropriate time.”  
Nowadays, although the ummah needs to increase the love between its individual members and to relieve itself of boredom, it has gone too far with regard to relaxation, laughter and jokes. This has become a habit which fills their gatherings and wastes their time, so their lives are wasted and their newspapers are filled with jokes and trivia. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If you knew what I know, you would laugh little and weep much.” In Fath al-Bari it says: “What is meant by knowledge here has to do with the might of Allah and His vengeance upon those who disobey Him, and the terrors that occur at death, in the grave and on the Day of Resurrection). 
Muslim men and women have to be inclined to choose righteous and serious friends in their lives, who will help them to make good use of their time and strive for the sake of Allah with seriousness and steadfastness, good and righteous people whose example they can follow. Bilal ibn Sa’d said: “I saw them [the Sahabah] jokingly pretending to fight over some goods, and laughing with one another, but when night came they were like monks.” 
Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) was asked, “Did the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) laugh?” He said, “Yes, and the faith in their hearts was like mountains.” 
So you have to follow the example of such people, who were knights by day and monks (i.e., devoted worshippers) by night. 
May Allah keep us, you and our parents safe on the Day of the Greatest Terror, those to whom the call will go out on that great Day: 
“Enter Paradise, no fear shall be on you, nor shall you grieve.” [Al-A’raf 7:49 – interpretation of the meaning]

He can be told that Allah is One and has no partner. He can be told that He is the Creator of all things, so He is the Creator of the earth, the heavens, people, animals, trees, rivers, etc. The educator can make the most of some situations by asking the child, whilst walking through a garden or in the countryside, about Who made the water, rivers and things in the natural scenery around him, to draw his attention to the greatness of the Creator. The father, mother or educators in general may be with a child or group of children in a car on a journey or a trip at the time of sunset, when the sun disappears from sight gradually. All that the educator has to do at that point is to draw the attention of those who are with him to the power of Allah displayed in that. 
A child can also be taught to understand the bounty of Allah and the blessing of good health that He has bestowed upon him. For example, you could say to him, “Who gave you your hearing, sight and mind? Who gave you strength and the ability to move?” and so on. The child can also be encouraged to love Allah and to thank Him for this blessing and bounty.  Making a child love Allah and the things that Allah loves is a good action which will bring educational benefits sooner or later, by Allah’s Leave.

A child may ask about his Lord, whether He eats or sleeps. In that case we have to answer and tell him that there is nothing like Allah, and He is the All-Hearing, All-Seeing; neither slumber nor sleep overtakes Him. Allah is not like us, He does not need to sleep, eat or drink. 
If these meanings are made simple for a child and explained to him in a way that is suited to his age, then the veneration of Allah in his heart is one of the things that will help him to be aware that Allah is watching him in secret and in public.","From Ummahaat qurba Abnaa’ihinna, p. 26"

    realized that he was the Messenger of Allaah according to the description 
    that they had, they could not stop their eyes from weeping or their hearts 
    from hastening to believe. 

    With regard to cursing those among the Christians who do not 
    believe in Muhammad  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), there 
    is innumerable definitive evidence which points to that, such as the hadeeth 
    narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim in their Saheehs from ‘Aa’ishah 
    (may Allaah be pleased with her), which says that the Messenger of Allaah 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, during his final 
    illness: “May Allaah curse the Jews and Christians, for they took the graves 
    of their Prophets as places of worship.” How can they not be cursed when 
    Allaah has described them in His Book as follows? 
“Surely, they have 
    disbelieved who say: ‘Allaah is the Messiah [‘Eesa (Jesus)], son of Maryam 
    (Mary).’”
[al-Maa'idah 5:72] 
“Surely, disbelievers 
    are those who said: ‘Allaah is the third of the three (in a Trinity).’”
[al-Maa'idah 5:73] 

    And there are other texts which speak of their kufr 
    (disbelief) and misguidance. 
Among the verses which 
    speak of their ultimate destiny is the last of the verses in the passage 
    referred to by the questioner, where Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning):

     “But those who disbelieved and belied Our Ayaat (proofs, 
    evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), they shall be the 
    dwellers of the (Hell) Fire”
[al-Maa'idah 5:86]

I am in charge of receiving patients. On Fridays I stay there alone, along with a doctor. Do I have to attend Jumu’ah prayers or not, seeing that the department receives accident victims and emergency cases 24 hours a day?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    If your work in the hospital requires you to be there at the 
    time of Jumu’ah prayer in case of accidents and emergencies, there is 
    nothing wrong with your staying in the hospital and you are excused for 
    missing Jumu’ah prayers. You should pray Zuhr, four rak’ahs, instead.","Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah. Majallat al-Buhooth al-Islamiyyah, 58/100-101"
22186,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22186,Do You Have to Recite Bismillah Before Every Surah?,"Must he say ""Bismillahi rahman nirahim"" quietly after finishing Al-Fatihah in order to begin the surah he will recite? What if he begins reciting in the middle of a surah?","If you are reciting the Surah after Al-Fatihah from the beginning, then you should say the Basmalah (Bismillah ir-Rahman ir-Rahim) apart from Surah At-Tawbah. If you are reciting from the middle of a Surah, then it is not recommended to recite the Basmalah.",,"Praise be to Allah.Reciting the Basmalah (i.e., the phrase “Bismillah ir-Rahman ir-Rahim (in the name of Allah, the most Gracious, the Most Merciful)” in prayer is encouraged not obligatory. 
It is recommended to recite the Basmalah if you are going to recite a Surah from the beginning, so the worshipper says it before Al-Fatihah . With regard to the Surah after Al-Fatihah, if he is reciting it from the beginning of the Surah, then he should say the Basmalah, apart from Surat At-Tawbah , because the Basmalah is not recited at the beginning of it. If he is reciting from the middle of a Surah , then it is not recommended to recite the Basmalah. 
The Standing Committee said: 
“The sound Sunnah indicates that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) recited the Basmalah in prayer before Al-Fatihah and before other Surahs, apart from Surat At-Tawbah, but he did not recite it out loud in the prayers in which he recited Quran out loud.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 6/378) 
They also said: 
It is prescribed to recite the Basmalah in every Rak`ah before Al-Fatihah and before every Surah apart from Surah Bara’ah (i.e., Surah At-Tawbah).” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 6/378) 
And they said: 
“If (the worshipper) is going to recite a Surah after Al-Fatihah, he should recite the Basmalah silently beforehand. But if he is going to recite a brief passage from the middle or end of a Surah, then it is not prescribed for him to recite the Basmalah.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 6/380)

22192,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22192,The meaning of Allaah’s name al-Haafiz,Can you give me an explanation of the beautiful names of Allah : Al Hafiz ?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.The name al-Haafiz is mentioned in the verse 
    in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“He said: ‘Can I entrust him to you except 
    as I entrusted his brother [Yoosuf (Joseph)] to you aforetime? But Allaah is the Best to guard (Haafiz), and He is the Most Merciful of those who 
    show mercy’”
[Yoosuf 12:64]

    Allaah also calls Himself al-Hafeez in several places in the Qur’aan. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Surely, my Lord is Guardian over all 
    things (Hafeez)”
[Hood 11:57]
al-Khattaabi said in Sha’n al-Du’aa’ 
    (67-68): “Al-Hafeez means al-Haafiz. Both are active participles but the form Hafeez carries a more intensive meaning, as in the words al-Qadeer 
    (All-powerful) and al-‘Aleem (All-knowing). He guards or keeps the heavens and the earth and everything therein, so that they will remain for as 
    long as they are to remain, and will not disappear. This is like the verses (interpretation of the meaning): 
‘and He feels no fatigue in guarding and 
    preserving them’
[al-Baqarah 2:255] 
‘And to guard against every rebellious 
    devil’
[al-Saffaat 37:7]
He 
    is the One Who protects His slaves from destruction and calamity and disaster, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“For him (each person), there are angels 
    in succession, before and behind him. They guard him by the Command of Allaah”
[al-Ra’d 13:11]
He keeps the records of His slaves’ deeds, 
    and he keeps a record of what they say; He knows their intentions and what is in their hearts. Nothing is hidden from Him. 
He protects His close friends (awliya’) 
    from falling into sin, and he guards them against the plots of the Shaytaan so that they will be safe from his evil and his temptation.” 
Al-Sa’di said in his Tafseer (18): 
    “Al-Hafeez is the One who protects that which He has created, and Whose knowledge encompasses that which He has brought into existence. He 
    protects His slaves from falling into sin and disaster, and He takes care of them in all situations. He records the deeds of His slaves and the 
    reward or punishment for that.”.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
22199,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22199,Can You Put Eye Drops While Fasting?,"If the bitter taste of eye drops enters the throat, does it break the fast? If you put the eye drops in during the day and then go to sleep, and do not know whether you swallowed it, what is the ruling?",The view favored by Ibn Taymiyyah is that putting eye drops while fasting does not break your fast.,,"Praise be to Allah.The scholars differed concerning eye drops and whether or not they break the fast . 
The view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin, is that they do not break the fast. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said: 
“Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah was of the view that kohl does not break the fast, not even if the taste of the kohl reaches the throat. He said, this is not called food or drink, and it is not like food or drink, and it does not have the same effect as food or drink. 
There is no sahih hadith from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) which expressly indicates that kohl breaks the fast, and the basic principle is that it does not break the fast. An act of worship remains valid unless it is proven that it is invalidated. What he said is correct, even if a person can taste it in his throat. Based on the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam, if a person puts drops in his eyes whilst fasting and tastes it in his throat, that does not break his fast.” (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 6/382)
