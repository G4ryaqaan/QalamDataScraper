44018,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/44018,Is the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) Mentioned in the Bible?,"What sort of references can I use to confirm that what GOD intended as regards His will, and that His will has been changed by Christian scribes/translators? Also, if you could tell me where in the Bible it speaks of the Prophet Muhammad, does it mention his name or it is symbolic?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Allah says in His Book (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And (remember) when ‘Eesa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), said: ‘O Children of Israel! I am the Messenger of Allah unto you, confirming the Tawraat [(Torah) which came] before me, and giving glad tidings of a Messenger to come after me, whose name shall be Ahmad.’ But when he (Ahmad, i.e. Muhammad) came to them with clear proofs, they said: ‘This is plain magic’” [al-Saff 61:6]
“Those who follow the Messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor write (i.e. Muhammad) whom they find written with them in the Tawraat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)— he commands them for Al-Ma‘roof (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam has ordained); and forbids them from Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism of all kinds, and all that Islam has forbidden); he allows them as lawful At-Tayyibaat (i.e. all good and lawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods), and prohibits them as unlawful Al-Khabaa’ith (i.e. all evil and unlawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods), he releases them from their heavy burdens (of Allah’s Covenant with the children of Israel), and from the fetters (bindings) that were upon them. So those who believe in him (Muhammad), honour him, help him, and follow the light (the Quran) which has been sent down with him, it is they who will be successful” [al-A’raaf 7:157] 
These two verses indicate that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is mentioned in the Torah and the Gospel (the Bible), no matter how much the Jews and Christians claim that he is not, for the word of Allah is the best and most truthful of words. 
Some of the things mentioned in the previous Books are as follows: 
1 – In the Torah, in the Book of Deuteronomy 18:18-19 it says: 
“I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers; I will put my words in his mouth, and he will tell them everything I command him.
If anyone does not listen to my words that the prophet speaks in my name, I myself will call him to account.”
(New International Version) 
This text is still extant among them. With regard to the phrase “from among their brothers” – if that prophet were to be from among the Children of Israel, it would have said, “I will raise up for them a prophet from among them.” But it says “from among their brothers” – i.e., from among the sons of Ismaa’eel (Ishamel). 
Secondly, it says in the Gospel of John 16:6-8, 12-13: 
 
“It is for your good that I am going away. Unless I go away, the Counselor [Paraclete] will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you. 
8When he comes, he will convict the world of guilt in regard to sin…
I have much more to say to you, more than you can now bear. But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all truth. He will not speak on his own; he will speak only what he hears, and he will tell you what is yet to come.”
(New International Version) 
This cannot apply to anyone except the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).
Secondly: Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It says in the Torah, in the fifth book [Deuteronomy 33:2]:  
“The LORD came from Sinai and dawned over them from Seir; he shone forth from Mount Paran. He came with myriads of holy ones from the south, from his mountain slopes [or: from his right hand went a fiery law for them].” 
(New International Version; alternative version of last phrase – the meaning of which is unclear in the original Hebrew texts – is from the King James Version) 
This refers to the three Prophethoods: the Prophethood of Moosa (Moses), the Prophethood of ‘Eesa (Jesus) and the Prophethood of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). “Coming from Sinai” refers to the mountain where Allah spoke to Moosa and called him and told him he was a Prophet. “Dawning over them from Seir” refers to the appearance of the Messiah from Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem). Seir is a village that is still known there to this day. So this was a foretelling of the Prophethood of the Messiah.  
“Paran” refers to Makkah. Allah likens the Prophethood of Moosa to the coming of the dawn, and the Prophethood of the Messiah after him to the rising of the sun, and the Prophethood of the Seal of the Prophets to the sun rising high in the sky and its light reaching all over the earth. And it came to pass exactly as foretold, for Allah dispelled the night of disbelief with the Prophethood of Moosa, and the light increased with the Prophethood of the Messiah, and was completed and reached everywhere on earth with the Prophethood of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). These three Prophets who were mentioned in this foretelling were also mentioned in the beginning of Soorat al-Teen (interpretation of the meaning): 
“By the fig, and the olive.
By Mount Sinai.
By this city of security (Makkah)”
[al-Teen 95:1-3]
End quote. See Hidaayat al-Hayaara, p. 110; and Ibn al-Qayyim’s comments on the Old Testament, Deuteronomy 33:1. 
 
Fourthly: Shaykh ‘Abd al-Majeed al-Zandaani said in his book al-Bishaaraat bi Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) fi’l-Kutub al-Samawiyyah al-Saabiqah that in the 22
nd chapter of the Gospel of Barnabas it says: 
“And this will continue until there comes Muhammad the Messenger of God who, when he comes, will expose this deceit to those who believe in the laws of God.”
 And it says in the Book of Isaiah: 
“I have made your name Muhammad O Muhammad, O beloved of the Lord, your name will abide forever.” 
And it says in the Book of Isaiah: 
“What I have given to him I will not give to anyone else: Ahmad, because he praises God and this praise comes from the best part of the earth, and this will bring joy to mankind and they will recite the word of divine unity on every hill and glorify God in every high place.” 
Many scholars have mentioned the places in the Bible where the name of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is mentioned. Sometimes his name is mentioned clearly, and sometimes he is described in ways that can only apply to him (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
You should note that the books of the Bible as they exist today have been altered and changed. This fact has been stated by non-Muslim historians, but despite all that we still find in the Bible the foretelling of the coming of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Shaykh Rahmat-Allah al-Hindi stated that every time the Christians were able to change something they did so, hence you will find that some of the ancient scholars quote passages from the Bible that no longer exist. But there are still other passages that foretell the Prophethood of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his coming. 
It should be noted that we have to arm ourselves with adequate sound knowledge in order to debate with the Christians, because even if they have no proof, they will still try to sow the seeds of doubt in people’s hearts so that they will give in to these wrong ideas and so that the truth will be concealed. “But Allah will bring His Light to perfection even though the disbelievers hate (it)” [al-Saff 61:8 – interpretation of the meaning].
Some of the most useful books on this topic are: Izhaar al-Haqq by Shaykh Rahmat-Allah al-Hindi; Kitaab Hidaayat al-Hayaara by Ibn Al-Qayyim; and al-Jawaab al-Saheeh by Ibn Taymiyyah. And Allah knows best.",Islam Q&A
44021,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/44021,Ending the Hijri Year with Istighfar and Fasting,"As the Hijri year draws to a close, there are many text messages saying that the page recording one’s good deeds will be closed at the end of the year, and urging us to end it with prayers for forgiveness and fasting. What is the ruling on these messages? Is fasting the last day of the year Sunnah? If it coincides with a Monday or a Thursday is that Bid`ah?","There is no suggestion that at the end of an old year or the beginning of a new year the records of deeds are closed and deeds are shown to Allah.

How many times are actions taken up to Allah weekly?


Are deeds presented to Allah in Sha`ban?


Should one end the Hijri year with Istighfar and fasting?","Praise be to Allah.When are deeds presented to Allah?
The Sunnah indicates that people’s good deeds are taken up to be shown to Allah without any delay, twice each day: once at night and once during the day. 
It is narrated by Muslim (179) that Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stood up before us and told us five things. He said: “Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, does not sleep and it is not befitting that He should sleep. He lowers the Balance and raises it; the deeds of the night are taken up to Him before the deeds of the day, and the deeds of the day before the deeds of the night…” 
An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The recording angels go up with the deeds of the night after it ends, at the beginning of the day, and they go up with the deeds of the day after it ends, at the beginning of the night.” 
Al-Bukhari (555) and Muslim (632) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The angels of the night and the day come to you in succession, and they meet at Fajr prayer and at `Asr prayer, then those who stayed among you ascend and their Lord asks them, although He knows best about them, `How did you leave My slaves?’ and they say, `We left them when they were praying and we came to them when they were praying.’”  
Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “This indicates that deeds are taken up at the end of the day. Whoever is in a state of obedience at that time will be blessed in his provision and his work, and Allah knows best. Hence we can see the wisdom behind the command to perform these prayers (Fajr and `Asr) regularly and pay attention to them.”
How many times are actions taken up to Allah weekly?
The Sunnah indicates that deeds are also shown to Allah (may He be Glorified and Exalted) twice each week. 
Muslim (2565) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “People’s deeds are shown [to Allah] twice each week, on Monday and Thursday, and every believing slave is forgiven except a person between whom and his brother there is a dispute, and it is said, `Leave these two until they reconcile.’” 
Are deeds presented to Allah in Sha`ban?
The Sunnah also indicates that the good deeds of each year are taken up to Allah all at once in the month of Sha`ban .
An-Nasa’i (1257) narrated that Usamah ibn Zayd (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I said: O Messenger of Allah, I do not see you fasting as much in any month as you fast in Sha`ban . He said: “That is a month concerning which the people are heedless, between Rajab and Ramadan, but it is a month in which good deeds are taken up to the Lord of the Worlds, and I would like my deeds to be taken up when I am fasting.” (Classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih Al-Jami`)
These texts may be summed up by noting that people’s deeds are shown to Allah in three ways:

Daily, which happens twice a day
Weekly, which also happens twice, on Mondays and Thursdays
Annually, which happens once, during the month of Sha`ban

Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The deeds of the year are taken up in Sha`ban, as the truthful one (the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has told us. The deeds of the week are shown on Monday and Thursday, the deeds of the day are taken up at the end of the day before night comes, and the deeds of the night are taken up at the end of the night, before day comes. When a person’s life comes to an end, all his life’s deeds are taken up and the record of his deeds is closed.” (Hashiyat Sunan Abu Dawud)
The Hadiths which indicate that deeds are shown to Allah indicate that it is encouraged to do more deeds of obedience at the times when the deeds are being shown to Him, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said concerning fasting in Sha`ban: “I would like my deeds to be taken up when I am fasting.” 
In Sunan At-Tirmidhi (747) it is narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Deeds are shown (to Allah) on Mondays and Thursdays, and I would like my deeds to be shown when I am fasting.” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Irwa’ Al-Ghalil (949) 
One of the Tabi`in (the generation after the Companions) used to weep in front of his wife on Thursdays and she would weep in front of him, and he would say: Today our deeds are being shown to Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted. (This was mentioned by Ibn Rajab in Lata’if Al-Ma`arif) 
Should one end the Hijri year with Istighfar and fasting?
From what we have mentioned it is clear that there is no suggestion that at the end of an old year or the beginning of a new year the records of deeds are closed and deeds are shown to Allah. Rather deeds are shown to Him in the various ways that we have mentioned, and the texts describe other times for this. The texts also indicate that the way of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is to do more acts of obedience at those times. 
Shaykh Salih Al-Fawzan (may Allah preserve him) said concerning commemorating the end of the year: “There is no basis for that, and singling out the end of the year for specific acts of worship such as fasting is a reprehensible innovation (Bid`ah).” 
With regard to fasting on Mondays and Thursdays, if that is a person’s habit, or if he is fasting on those days because of the reports which encourage doing so, then he should not refrain from doing so because it coincides with the end or beginning of the year, so long as he is not fasting on that day because of that coincidence, or because he thinks that there is any special virtue in fasting on that occasion.

44029,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/44029,Ruling on buying products on which there are images,What is the ruling on buying sweets or products on which there are images of animate beings?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Buying these things, if they are bought because of those 
    images, is haraam, because that is acquiring images, which prevents the 
    angels from entering the house. 

    Undoubtedly it is better for the Muslim to keep away from 
    everything that may cause the angels not to enter the house. 

    But if most of these things have images on them, and it is 
    hard for the Muslim to find products that do not have any images on them, 
    then there is no sin in that in sha Allaah, so as to ward off hardship from 
    the Muslims. 

    It says in al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (12/112): 

    The Maalikis have two views on the production of images which 
    are not meant to last, such as those that are made of dough. The more well 
    known view is that it is not allowed. Both views were narrated by al-‘Adawi, 
    and he said: Those who say that it is permissible are referring to things 
    made of dough or melon peel, because when it dries out it breaks. 

    According to the Shaafa’is, it is haraam to make it but it is 
    not haraam to sell it. End quote. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in
    al-Sharh al-Mumti’ (2/203): 

    Nowadays the problem is widespread and it is common to find 
    images on everything, except in rare cases. They are to be found on vessels, 
    food containers, books, newspapers and everything except what which Allaah 
    wills. There are also images that can be eaten, such as biscuits in the 
    shape of fish and rabbits. We say: if a person keeps the images (i.e., he 
    keeps the things because of the images on them), this is undoubtedly haraam. 
    If he buys magazines which publish images because of the images, this is 
    also haraam, but if he buys them for knowledge and to read the news, we hope 
    that there is nothing wrong with that, because of hardship. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “and [Allaah] has not laid upon you in religion any 
    hardship”

    [al-Hajj 22:78]

    These images should not be the aim when a person buys 
    something, and he should not be concerned with them at all. With regard to 
    vessels and food boxes, etc., it may be said that these pictures are not 
    being treated with respect, so there is no need to regard them as haraam.

44038,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/44038,Ruling on divorcing in jest,"If a man says to his wife, “You are divorced,” but he did not intend it as a divorce, rather he was joking with her, does that count as a divorce?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The scholars differed as to whether a divorce given in jest 
    counts as a divorce. The majority are of the view that it does count as 
    such, and they quoted as evidence the report narrated by Abu Hurayrah (may 
    Allaah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There are three matters in which 
    seriousness is serious and joking is serious: marriage, divorce and taking 
    back (one’s wife).” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2194; al-Tirmidhi, 1184; Ibn 
    Maajah, 2039.  The scholars differed as to whether this report is saheeh 
    (sound) or da’eef (weak). Al-Albaani classed it as hasan in Irwa’ 
    al-Ghaleel, 1826. 

    A similar meaning was narrated in mawqoof reports from some 
    of the Sahaabah. 

    It was narrated that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) said: “There are four things which become binding if they 
    are spoken: divorce, manumission, marriage and vows.” 

    It was narrated from ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him): 
    “There are three in which jesting is like seriousness: divorce, marriage and 
    manumission.” 

    Abu’l-Darda’ said: “There are three matters in which jesting 
    is just as valid as saying them seriously: divorce, marriage and 
    manumission.” 

    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, after 
    mentioning the hadeeth quoted above: 

    These Sunnahs imply that one who is accountable jokes about 
    divorce, marriage or taking back his wife, then what he joked about becomes 
    binding on him. This indicates that the words of a joker carry weight even 
    though the words of a sleeper, one who forgets, one who has lost his mind 
    and one who is forced do not count. The difference between them is that the 
    joker intends to say the words although he does not want the ruling on his 
    words to apply, but it is not up to him. Rather uttering these words is up 
    to him, but as tforo the ruling on those word, that is up to the Lawgiver, 
    whether the person intended it or not. What matters here is the word that he 
    chose to use willingly when he is of sound mind and accountable. If he 
    intended to utter these words, then the Lawgiver will apply the ruling to 
    him whether he was serious or was joking. This is unlike one who is sleeping 
    or the one who has lost his mind or one who is insane etc, they do not have 
    any real intention and they are not accountable, so the words that they say 
    are idle talk, like the talk of a child who does not understand what he is 
    saying and does not mean it. 

    The heart of the matter is the differentiation between one 
    who says something deliberately, knowing what he says but not intending to 
    be subject to the ruling on what he says, and one who does not mean it and 
    does not know what it means. There are four categories: 

    1-When he intends the ruling but 
    does not utter the words

    2-When he does not intend the 
    ruling or the words

    3-When he intends the words but 
    not the ruling

    4-When he intends both the words 
    and the ruling.

    The first two are idle talk, and the second two carry weight. 
    This is what may be understood from all the texts and rulings. End quote. 

    Zaad al-Ma’aad, 5/204, 205 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’ 
    (10/461): 

    Divorce takes place whether uttered in seriousness or in 
    jest. The difference between them is that the one who is serious intends 
    both the words and the ruling, whereas the one who is joking intends the 
    words but not the ruling. 

    The one who is serious divorces his wife and intends divorce. 
    The joker intends to say the words but does not intend the ruling. So he 
    says, for example, “I was joking with my wife”, or “I was joking with my 
    friend, and I said: ‘My wife is divorced’ or some such.” And he says: “I did 
    not intend that she should be divorced, rather I intended to say the 
    words.” 

    We say: The ruling applies in this case, because you have 
    uttered the words, and the ruling is up to Allaah. 

    So long as the word of divorce is uttered with a valid 
    intention by a person who is of sound mind and can understand what it means, 
    then it counts as such. Even if he says, “I did not mean it as such,” it is 
    not up to him, rather it is up to Allaah. 

    This is from the rational point of view. 

    With regard to the reports, we have the report of Abu 
    Hurayrah: “There are three matters in which seriousness is serious and 
    joking is serious: marriage, divorce and taking back (one’s wife).” This is 
    the evidence from the texts. 

    Some of the scholars said that a divorce issued in jest does 
    not count; how can the divorce of one who is joking count when all he 
    intended was to speak the words? Some of the scholars rebuked those who say 
    that the divorce of one who is joking counts as such and said: You say that 
    he is joking so how can you say that it counts as such, and take him 
    seriously? 

    The response to these people is: we are only saying what is 
    indicated by the evidence. This hadeeth was classed as saheeh by some and as 
    hasan by others. There is no doubt that it counts as evidence, so we follow 
    it. 

    Moreover, reason implies it, because if we open this door, 
    everyone will make such claims, in which case there will be no more divorce 
    on earth. The correct view is that it does count as such, whether he was 
    serious or was joking. 

    Moreover, if we say that it counts as such, there is the 
    benefit of discipline, which restrains those people who want to play with 
    the words of divorce. If the person who toys with the concept of divorce 
    realizes that he will be called to account for it, he will never do that. 

    But the one who says “I was joking” opens the door to people 
    to take the rulings of Allaah as a joke. End quote.

If the deceased has any money then the expenses of preparing him for burial should be paid from his own money. This takes precedence over paying off his debts and executing his will if he left a will, and it comes before the division of the estate. The evidence for that is the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) concerning a man who died in ‘Arafah: “Shroud him in his two garments.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1851; Muslim, 1206. 
Ibn al-Qayyim said in Zaad al-Ma’aad, 2/240 concerning the rulings that are derived from this hadeeth: 
The shroud takes precedence over the rights of the heirs and payment of debts, because the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ordered that he be buried in his two garments, and he did not ask about his heirs or any debts that he owed. If it had been otherwise he would have asked. 
Just as clothing him when he is alive takes precedence over paying off his debts, the same applies after death. This is the view of the majority, and there is a differing opinion to which no attention need be paid. End quote. 
See: al-Majmoo’, 5/147; al-Mughni, 3/457 
Al-Kasaani said in Badaa’i’ al-Sanaa’i’ (2/330): He should be shrouded from his entire wealth, before paying off debts, executing his will or dividing the estate, because this is one of the basic needs of the deceased. So it is like spending on him when he is alive. End quote. 
Secondly: 
If the deceased does not have any wealth then shrouding him or her is the duty of the one who is obliged to spend on him or her (such as the father, son or husband). If there is no such person then it must be done by the bayt al-maal. If there is no bayt al-maal then it must be done by the Muslims. 
See: al-Majmoo’, 5/148-150; Badaa’i’ al-Sanaa’i’, 2/330 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 5/219: The bayt al-maal of the Muslims is mentioned before the Muslims in general because the bayt al-maal is for all Muslims, unlike the case if it is done by the Muslims, because the one who donates it will feel that he has done him a favour. End quote. 
He also said (5/217): But if we assume that there is an organization that is responsible for that, there is nothing wrong if we shroud him from that, unless he issued instructions to the contrary, such as saying, Shroud me from my own wealth, in which case it is not permissible to shroud him using the public shrouds, whether that is done by a government organization or a private one. End quote. 
Thirdly: 
Because the husband is obliged to spend on his wife when she is alive, shrouding her is obligatory for him. 
This is the view of Abu Haneefah, al-Shaafa’i and Maalik. Ahmad said: It must be paid for from her wealth. 
See: al-Majmoo’, 5/148-150; Haashiyat Ibn ‘Aabideen, 3/101 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’ (5/219), commenting on the view of the majority: This view is more correct if he is well off. 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Sa’di (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Is a husband obliged to shroud his wife? He replied: 
The correct view is that the husband is obliged to shroud his wife, whether she was well off or not. This is part of spending and kind treatment, and the people regard it as wrong if it is suggested that if the wife of a man who is rich and well off dies, he does not have to shroud her. End quote. 
Al-Faatawa al-Jaami’ah li’l-Mar’ah al-Muslimah, 2/242 
But a wife is not obliged to shroud her husband, because she is not obliged to spend on him when he is alive. 
Al-Kasaani said in Badaa’i’ al-Sanaa’i’ (2/330): The wife is not obliged to shroud her husband, according to consensus, just as she is not obliged to clothe him when he is alive. End quote.",Islam Q&A
