45713,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45713,He is exempted from paying duties; can he allow others to buy goods in his name?,"Some brothers and I work in the diplomatic corps in a country that lets us off paying duties. Some citizens of that country come to us to buy goods for them in our name so that they can make use of that exemption and not have to pay duties, in return for paying us a sum of money. Is that permissible?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    This question covers two topics: 

    1 – Customs and duties i.e., taxes that are charged on goods 
    and products when moving them to one country to another. Taking these taxes 
    from Muslims is expressly forbidden. This is the maks of which the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The one who 
    collects the maks will be in the Fire.” Narrated by Ahmad, 16553; classed as 
    saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 3405. see also 
    question no. 25758. 

    It is prescribed to avoid paying this forbidden tax by 
    whatever means possible so that it will not harm him or cause more damage, 
    even if he does that by means of a trick or paying some money to avoid this 
    injustice. 

    If someone were to say that this comes under the heading of a 
    person giving up his rights in return for money, that is permissible. This 
    is what the fuqaha’ call waiving one’s rights. The Maalikis said that it is 
    permissible to receive payment in return for the right to pre-emption and 
    the Hanafis allowed waiving rights to appointment to public office and 
    forfeiting the right to custody in return for money. See al-Mawsoo’ah 
    al-Fiqhiyyah al-Kuwaitiyyah, 4/243, 32/83. 

    The answer is that this is not the same as that, because 
    those who are exempted from paying duties are the members of the diplomatic 
    corps themselves; they are not allowed to exploit this favour to make money 
    by allowing other people to avoid paying duties. Using it to allow the goods 
    of others to pass into the country is a kind of trickery and deceit. If this 
    is permitted, it is only permitted in cases of necessity, not for one to 
    make a profit from it. 

    There follow some points of advice: 

    1-Those who work in the 
    diplomatic corps should help their brothers for free, because that comes 
    under the heading of warding off injustice from them. They must do this as 
    much as they can.

    2-If they do not want to offer 
    this service for free, then it is not permissible for them to take more than 
    costs of shipping the goods, accompanying them, doing the necessary 
    paperwork, etc.

    We also remind them that they have to be kind to their Muslim 
    brethren and have a good intention in doing so; their aim should not simply 
    be to amass wealth. And Allaah is the Source of strength.",Islam Q&A
45715,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45715,Can the wife of a prisoner wear provocative clothing for him when visiting him?,"In some Muslim countries those who are religiously committed and adhere to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) are detained and imprisoned. 

The wives of these prisoners visit their husbands and the visits occur in a place where they are allowed to sit with them. Of course these sisters wear niqaab and they put something like a tent over their heads so that their husbands can see them. But some of the sisters wear  revealing blouses so that their husbands can enjoy looking at them, because they have been in prison for 6 years or more. Is it permissible for a sister to do that, knowing that no one else can see her except her husband? As I said, they do that to reduce the pain suffered by their husbands.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    A woman may adorn herself for her husband in various ways and 
    uncover her charms before him at any time, because he has the right to enjoy 
    intimacy with her. 

    With regard to what you have mentioned about doing that 
    inside the prison, there is nothing wrong with that, subject to two 
    conditions: 

    1 – That no stranger (non-mahram) can see the woman, either 
    directly or through surveillance equipment. 

    2 – That this does not have a negative effect on the husband, 
    such as provoking his desires and inflaming his emotions, or causing him to 
    compromise his religious commitment and give up his adherence to the truth 
    that he is following, because he wants to get out and go to his wife and 
    children. Allaah has warned us that our wives and children may be a source 
    of fitnah (temptation) who may prevent a man from doing that which Allaah 
    has enjoined upon him. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Say: If your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your 
    wives, your kindred, the wealth that you have gained, the commerce in which 
    you fear a decline, and the dwellings in which you delight are dearer to you 
    than Allaah and His Messenger, and striving hard and fighting in His Cause, 
    then wait until Allaah brings about His Decision (torment). And Allaah 
    guides not the people who are Al-Faasiqoon (the rebellious, disobedient to 
    Allaah)”

    [al-Tawbah 9:24] 

    “O you who believe! Verily, among your wives and your 
    children there are enemies for you (who may stop you from the obedience of 
    Allaah); therefore beware of them! But if you pardon (them) and overlook, 
    and forgive (their faults), then verily, Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most 
    Merciful”

    [al-Taghaabun 64:14]

    ‘Attaar ibn Yassaar said: All of Soorat al-Taghaabun was 
    revealed in Makkah, apart from these verses, which were revealed concerning 
    ‘Awf ibn Maalik al-Ashja’i, who had wives and children, and when he wanted 
    to go out for jihad they wept and tore at his heart, and said, “Who are you 
    leaving us to?” He felt sorry for them so he stayed, then this whole verse 
    was revealed in Madeenah concerning ‘Awf ibn Maalik al-Ashja’i. 

    Al-Tirmidhi narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas said, when a man asked 
    him about this verse: Those were some men from Makkah who became Muslim, and 
    they wanted to go and join the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) [in Madeenah], but their wives and children refused to let them 
    go to join the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
    When they finally came to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) they saw that the people had learned a great deal about Islam, and 
    they wanted to punish (their wives and children), then Allaah revealed this 
    verse. This was classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 
    3317.

    His religion prevail and to relieve the distress of our Muslim brethren, for

45716,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45716,"It is too difficult for her to do ghusl from janaabah so she does not pray, then she repents, then she does that again.","There is a woman who prays, then stops praying, then wants to repent. She does not pray because she has intercourse with her husband then delays doing ghusl, then she regrets it again. Sometimes she does not pray for a whole week.

She is afraid that she will do that again and that the Lord of the Worlds will never forgive her.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Prayer is the greatest pillar of Islam after the Shahaadatayn, and the one who does not pray out of negligence or laziness is a kaafir who is beyond the pale of Islam, according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions, because of a great deal of evidence to that effect, such as the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Between a man and shirk and kufr stands his giving up prayer.” Narrated by Muslim, 82. 
And he said: “The covenant that stands between us and them is prayer. Whoever gives it up is a kaafir.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2621; al-Nasaa’i, 463; Ibn Maajah, 1079. 
How can a Muslim woman willingly expose herself to being classed as a disbeliever in Allaah just because she finds it difficult to do ghusl? In fact it is not difficult to do ghusl, apart from the tricks that the Shaytaan tries to play on people. 
This sister has to fear Allaah and His punishment. She should hasten to repent sincerely before the destroyer of pleasures and separator of people (i.e., death) catches her unawares. She must start praying again and continue to do so, and she should become one of the people of purity and cleanliness, for Allaah loves those who repent and He loves those who are pure.
 Her fear of going back to sin should motivate her to adhere to obedience and persist therein, not to fall short and be negligent. The believer should feel aware of Allaah and realize that Allaah accepts the repentance of those who repent, and guides further those who follow His guidance. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Know they not that Allaah accepts repentance from His slaves and takes the Sadaqaat (alms, charity), and that Allaah Alone is the One Who forgives and accepts repentance, Most Merciful?”

“And Allaah increases in guidance those who walk aright. And the righteous good deeds that last, are better with your Lord, for reward and better for resort”

Allaah forgives all sins for those who repent to Him, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say: “O ‘Ibaadi (My slaves) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allaah, verily, Allaah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful”

Is the money earned by the broker or middleman halal?,Brokerage (samsarah) refers to mediation between the seller and the buyer. A number of scholars have stated that it is permissible to work as a broker and to receive payment for it.,"What is brokerage? 


Conditions of a broker in Islam


Is brokerage haram in Islam?","Praise be to Allah.What is brokerage? 
Brokerage (samsarah) refers to mediation between the seller and the buyer. The broker is the one who mediates between the seller and the buyer to bring about a sale, and he guides the buyer to the product and he guides the seller on prices."" (Al-Mawsu’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 10/151)
People have a great need for brokers, because many people do not know how to bargain when buying and selling; others are not able to closely examine the things they buy to find out if there are any faults in them; and others do not have time to engage directly in buying and selling themselves. 
Hence brokerage is useful work which benefits the seller, the buyer and the broker. 
Conditions of a broker in Islam

It is essential for the broker to be experienced in the area where he is mediating between sellers and buyers, so that no one will be harmed by his claim to have knowledge and experience that he does not have. 
He must also be trustworthy and honest, and he should not favour one of them at the expense of the other; rather he must point out any faults in the goods as well as any good qualities, in an honest and truthful manner, and not deceive either the seller or the buyer. 

Is brokerage haram in Islam?
A number of scholars have stated that it is permissible to work as a broker and to receive payment for it . 
Imam Malik (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about the payment of a broker and he said: “There is nothing wrong with it.” (Al-Mudawwanah, 3/466) 
Imam al-Bukhari said in his Sahih: 
“Chapter on the wages of a broker: Ibn Sirin, ‘Ata, Ibrahim and al-Hasan did not see anything wrong with the wages of a broker.” 
Ibn 'Abbas said: “There is nothing wrong with saying, “Sell this garment and whatever there is above such and such a price is yours.” 
Ibn Sirin said: “If he says, “Sell if for such and such and whatever profit there is, is yours , or is shared between you and me,” there is nothing wrong with that.”  
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The Muslims are bound by their conditions.”"" (Al-Bukhari) 
Ibn Qudamah said in al-Mughni (8/42): 
“It is permissible to hire a broker to buy clothes for you. Ibn Sirin, ‘Ata and al-Nakha’i said that this is allowed. 
It is permissible to hire him for a stated period, such as hiring him for ten days, during which he is to buy for you, because the time is defined and the work is defined… If the work is specified but the time is not, but he says that he will have a certain amount for each thousand dirhams, that is also valid. 
If he says that he is hiring him to sell certain clothes for him, that is valid, as was stated by al-Shafi’i, because that is permissible and it is permissible to delegate someone to do that and it is permissible to hire him for that, like selling clothes.” 
The Standing Committee was asked about the owner of a bookshop who worked as an agent for some companies in marketing their products, where they send him a sample which he shows to the traders in the marketplace, and sells it at the company’s price in return for a commission agreed upon with the company. Is there any sin involved in that? 
They replied: 
“If the situation is as described, it is permissible for you to take that commission , and there is no sin on you."" (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 13/125)
Shaykh Ibn Baz was asked about the ruling on looking for a store or apartment to rent in return for a payment given by the one on whose behalf you are looking. 
He replied: 
“There is nothing wrong with that. You have to try hard to find a suitable place that the person wants to rent. If you help him in that and find him a suitable place, and you help him to reach an agreement on the rent with the landlord, there is nothing wrong with this, in sha Allah, subject to the condition that there is no betrayal or cheating, and it is done in an honest manner. If you are sincere and fulfil the trust in finding what is wanted without any deceit or wrongdoing either towards him or towards the property owner, then you have done well in sha Allah.""

Du`a after wudu


Du`a during wudu","Praise be to Allah.Du’as to be said at the beginning of wudu and after finishing it have been narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
Du`a before wudu
With regard to what is to be said at the beginning, the only thing that has been narrated is to mention the name of Allah by saying Bismillah (in the name of Allah). 
The evidence for that is the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “There is no wudu for one who does not mention the name of Allah in it.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 25. He said: Concerning this topic it was narrated from ‘Aishah, Abu Sa’id, Abu Hurayrah, Sahl ibn Sa’d and Anas. Ahmad ibn Hanbal said: I do not know of any hadith with a jayyid isnad on the topic. (Al-Tirmidhi)
The hadeeth was classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi. 
In the answer to question no. 21241  we have stated that this hadith is one concerning whose soundness the scholars differed. 
Al-Nawawi narrated in al-Majmu’ (1/385) that al-Bayhaqi said: 
“The soundest report concerning saying Bismillah (for wudu) is the hadith of Anas, according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) put his hand in the vessel of water then he said: “Do wudu in the name of Allah.” [Anas] said: I saw the water springing up from between his fingers, and the people did wudu until the last of them had done wudu, and there were nearly seventy men. Its isnad is jayyid, and it was quoted as evidence by al-Bayhaqi in his book Ma’rifat al-Sunan wa’l-Athar; he classed the other ahadith as da’eef (weak).”
Du`a after wudu
With regard to what is said after wudu , a number of ahadith have been narrated concerning that. 
From the reports it may be concluded that he said: 
Ashhadu an la ilaha ill-allah wahdahu la sharika lah, wa ashhadu anna Muhammadan ‘abduhu wa rasuluhu. allahumm aj’alni min al-tawwabina waj’alni min al-mutatahhirina, subhanaka allahumma wa bi hamdika, ashhadu an la ilaha illa anta, astaghfiruka wa atubu ilayka
(I bear witness that there is no god except Allah Alone, with no partner or associate, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger. O Allah, make me one of those who repent and make me one of those who purify themselves. Glory and praise be to You, O Allah,  I bear witness that there is no god but You, I seek Your forgiveness and I repent to You). 
Muslim (234) narrated from ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no one among you who does wudu and does it well, then says, Ashhadu an la ilaha ill-Allah wahdahu la sharika lah, wa ashhadu anna Muhammadan ‘abduhu was rasuluhu (I bear witness that there is no god except Allah Alone, with no partner or associate, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger) but the eight gates of Paradise will be opened for him and he will enter through whichever one he wants.” Narrated by Muslim, 234. 
Al-Tirmidhi (55) added: “allahumm aj’alni min al-tawwabeena waj’alni min al-mutatahhireena (O Allah, make me one of those who repent and make me one of those who purify themselves).” 
This addition was classed as da’if (weak) by al-Hafiz ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him), who said: This addition which is narrated by al-Tirmidhi is not proven to be part of this hadith. End quote from al-Futuhat al-Rabbaniyyah, 2/19. 
Al-Albani classed it as sahih in Sahih al-Tirmidhi. Ibn al-Qayyim stated in Zad al-Ma'ad that it is proven to be from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
With regard to the phrase “subhanaka allahumma wa bi hamdika, ashhadu an la ilaha illa anta, astaghfiruka wa atubu ilayka (Glory and praise be to You, O Allah, I bear witness that there is no god but You, I seek Your forgiveness and I repent to You), this was narrated by al-Nasai in ‘Aml al-Yawm wal-Laylah, and by al-Hakim in al-Mustadrak, from Abu Sa’id al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him). The narrators differed as to whether the hadith could be attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or whether these were the words of Abu Sa’id (may Allah be pleased with him). 
Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“The isnad is undoubtedly sound, rather they differed as to whether the text could be attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or not (i.e., whether it was marfu’ or mawquf). Al-Nasai always rules on the basis of erring on the side of caution, hence he was mistaken. But according to the method of al-Nawawi, following Ibn al-Salah and others, it is more likely to be marfu’.” (Al-Futuhat al-Rabbaniyyah, 2/21)
It was classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Targhib (225) and al-Silsilah al-Sahihah (2333). (See Tamam al-Minnah, p. 94-98)
Du`a during wudu
These are the du’as that have been narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to be said in wudu . As for saying du’a when washing the different parts of the body, no such thing has been proven from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
Al-Nawawi said in al-Adhkar (p. 30): 
“As for the du’as that are said when washing various parts of the body in wudu, no such thing has been narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).” 
Ibn al-Qayyim said in Zad al-Ma'ad (1/195):  
“It is not narrated from him that he used to say anything in his wudu apart from saying Bismillah. Every hadith which speaks of du’as to be said in wudu is false and fabricated. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not say any of these things and he did not teach them to his ummah. There is nothing narrated from him except saying Bismillah at the beginning and saying Ashhadu an la ilaha ill-Allah wahdahu la sharika lah, wa ashhadu anna Muhammadan ‘abduhu wa rasuluhu. allahumm aj’alni min al-tawwabina waj’alni min al-mutatahhirina (I bear witness that there is no god except Allah Alone, with no partner or associate, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger. O Allah, make me one of those who repent and make me one of those who purify themselves) afterwards. 
According to another hadith narrated in Sunan al-Nasai, one of the things that may also be said after wudu is: “Subhanaka Allahumma wa bi hamdika, ashhadu an la ilaha illa anta, astaghfiruka wa atubu ilayka (Glory and praise be to You, O allah,  I bear witness that there is no god but You, I seek Your forgiveness and I repent to You).” 
It says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah (5/221): 
“It is not proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said any du’a during wudu. What the common folk say in dua when washing each part of the body is an innovation (bid’ah), such as saying when washing the face, “O Allah, make my face white on the day when faces will be turned black”; or when washing the hands: “O Allah, give me my book (record of my deeds) in my right hand, and do not give me my book in my left hand,” and other du’as which are said when washing the other parts of the body in wudu.”",Islam Q&A

It is permissible for seven people to share one camel or cow.","Is it permissible to share in a sacrifice? 


How many people can share in a sacrifice?","Praise be to Allah.Is it permissible to share in a sacrifice? 
It is permissible to share in a sacrifice if it is a camel or a cow, but it is not permissible to share in a sheep. It is permissible for seven people to share one camel or cow. 
The Prophet’s Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) shared sacrifices: seven people would share a camel or a cow in Hajj and ‘Umrah. 
Muslim (1318) narrated that Jabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “On the day of al-Hudaybiyah we offered the sacrifice with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), a camel on behalf of seven and a cow on behalf of seven. 
According to another report, Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) said: We performed Hajj with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and we sacrificed a camel on behalf of seven and a cow on behalf of seven. 
Abu Dawud (2808) narrated from Jabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “A cow on behalf of seven and a camel on behalf of seven.” (Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud) 
How many people can share in a sacrifice? 
Al-Nawawi said in Sharh Muslim: 
“These ahadith indicate that it is permissible to share in the sacrifice, but they are unanimously agreed that it is not permissible to share in a sheep. These ahadith indicate that a camel is sufficient on behalf of seven people , and a cow is sufficient on behalf of seven people, and each of them takes the place of seven sheep. So if a muhrim is required to offer seven sacrifices –except in the case of the penalty for hunting – and he slaughters a camel or a cow, that is equivalent to them all.”
 The Standing Committee was asked about sharing in the sacrifice and they replied: 
“A camel or a cow is sufficient on behalf of seven people, whether they are all from one family or are from different families, and whether they are related to one another or not, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) gave permission to the Sahaabah to share a camel or a cow, one animal for every seven people, and he did not say anything more specific than that.” (Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 11/401) 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Ahkaam al-Udhiyah: 
“One sheep is sufficient for one person, and one-seventh of a camel or cow is sufficient for what one sheep is sufficient for.”

This is the view of Abu Haneefah and al-Shaafa’i, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said concerning Jumu’ah: “Whoever comes at the earliest hour, it is as if he sacrificed a camel. Whoever comes in the second hour, it is as if he sacrificed a cow. Whoever comes in the third hour, it is as if he sacrificed a horned ram. Whoever comes in the fourth hour, it is as if he sacrificed a chicken. Whoever comes in the fifth hour, it is as if he sacrificed an egg.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 881; Muslim, 850. 
It is a sacrifice by means of which one draws closer to Allaah, so the best (to be offered) is a camel, as in the case of the hadiy (sacrifice offered by the pilgrim on Hajj). 
A sheep is better than sharing in a camel, because the aim of the sacrifice is to shed blood. A ram is better than a sheep (ewe), because that is what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sacrificed and the meat is better. End quote from al-Mughni, 13/366 
The Standing Committee was asked: Which is better for sacrifice, a ram or a cow? 
They replied: 
The best sacrifice is a camel, then a cow, then a sheep, then a share of a camel or cow, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said concerning Jumu’ah: “Whoever comes at the earliest hour, it is as if he sacrificed a camel…” 
The point here is that there is an order of preference between camels, cows and sheep in drawing close to Allaah through the sacrifice. Undoubtedly sacrifice is one of the greatest acts of worship through which we may draw closer to Allaah. A camel is more valuable and more useful. This is the view of the three imams – Abu Haneefah, al-Shaafa’i and Ahmad. Maalik said: The best is a young sheep, then a cow, then a camel, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sacrificed two rams, and he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not do anything but that which was best. 
The response to that is that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sometimes chose the option that was not the best option out of kindness to his ummah, because they follow his example. He (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not want to make things difficult for them. He stated that the best is a camel, then a cow, then a sheep, as stated above. And Allaah knows best.

(45916) we stated that one sacrifice is sufficient for a man and the members of his family even if they are one hundred strong, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to offer a single sheep on behalf of himself and his family, and when he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) died he left behind nine wives. 
Al-Qurtubi said: 
There is no report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) ordered each of his wives to offer a separate sacrifice, even though the sacrifice was repeated every year and his wives were numerous. This would have been narrated if it has happened, as other minor issues were narrated. This is supported by the report narrated by Maalik, Ibn Maajah and al-Tirmidhi, who classed it as saheeh via ‘Ata’ ibn Yasaar: I asked Abu Ayyoob: How was the sacrifice done at the time of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)? He said: A man would offer a sheep on behalf of himself and the members of his family, and they would eat some and feed others with some.” End quote from Fath al-Baari. The hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
Al-Bukhaari (7210) narrated from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Hishaam (may Allaah be pleased with him), that he met the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when his mother Zaynab bint Humayd took him to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and said: “O Messenger of Allaah, accept his oath of allegiance.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “He is too young.” He patted him on the head and made du’aa’ for him, and he used to sacrifice a single sheep on behalf of his whole family. 
Al-Haafiz said: The phrase “and he used to sacrifice a single sheep on behalf of his whole family” refers to ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Hishaam. End quote. 
The Standing Committee was asked: 
I have two households which are about fifteen kilometers apart, and I want to offer the sacrifice. Should I offer a sacrifice at each house, or at one house? 
They replied: 
It is sufficient for you to offer one sacrifice on behalf of your two households, so long as the head of both is one person. But if you offer a separate sacrifice at each house, that is better. End quote.

It is permissible to share in a cow or a camel even if some of the participants do not have the intention of offering a sacrifice, and simply want the meat to eat it, sell it or whatever. 
Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmoo’, 8/372: 
It is permissible to have a share of one-seventh of a camel or a cow for sacrifice, whether all the people are members of the same household or not, or whether some of them just want the meat; that is sufficient on the part of the one who is offering the sacrifice, whether the sacrifice is in fulfilment of a vow or is offered voluntarily.

 Having established that, it makes no difference whether the partners are members of one household or not, whether they are offering an obligatory or voluntary sacrifice, or whether some of them have the intention of offering a sacrifice whilst others simply want the meat, because the share of each of them is sufficient for him and the intention of the others does not matter.

45781,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45781,Is It Better to Pray Tarawih at Home?,"Is it better to do Tarawih in congregation in the mosque, or to pray it at home?",Praying Tarawih in congregation in the mosque is better than praying at home. This is indicated by the Sunnah and the actions of the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them).,,"Praise be to Allah.Praying Tarawih in congregation in the mosque is better than praying at home . This is indicated by the Sunnah and the actions of the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them). 

Al-Bukhari (1129) and Muslim (761) narrated from `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed one night in the mosque, and the people followed him in prayer. Then he prayed the next night, and many people came. Then they gathered on the third or fourth night, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not come out to them. The next morning he said: “I saw what you did, and nothing kept me from coming out to you except the fact that I feared that it would be made obligatory for you.” And that was in Ramadan. 

This indicates that praying Tarawih in congregation is prescribed according to the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), but he refrained from doing it because he feared that it would be made obligatory for the ummah. When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) died, this reservation was no longer required, because the Shari`ah was established. 

Al-Tirmidhi (806) narrated that Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever prays qiyam – i.e., Tarawih – with the imam until he finishes, it will be recorded as if he spent the whole night in prayer.”  (Classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi)
Al-Bukhari (2010) narrated that ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn ‘Abd al-Qari said: I went out with ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) to the mosque one night in Ramadan, and the people were scattered, each man praying by himself. Some men would pray and have groups of people behind them following them. ‘Umar said: “I think that if I unite all these people with one reader, it will be better. Then he resolved to gather them behind Ubayy ibn Ka’b. 

Al-Hafiz said: 
“Ibn al-Tin and others said that ‘Umar based this decision on the Prophet’s approval of those who prayed with him on those nights. Although he disliked that for them, that was based on the fear that it might be made obligatory for them. When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) died, there was no longer any fear of that happening, and ‘Umar thought, because of the potential division that might arise from people praying separately, and because uniting them behind one reader is more motivating for many people. The majority agreed with ‘Umar’s decision.” (Fath al-Bari) 
Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmu’, 3/526: 
“Praying Tarawih is Sunnah according to scholarly consensus… It is permissible to offer this prayer alone or in congregation, but which is better? There are two well-known opinions on this matter. The correct view according to the consensus of our companions is that praying it in congregation is better. The second view is that it is better to pray it individually. 
Our companions said: The difference of opinion has to do with one who has memorized the Quran; there is no fear that he may become lazy and neglect it if he prays on his own, and the congregation in the mosque is not going to be affected if he stays away.  But if one of these factors is absent, then praying in congregation is better, and there is no difference of scholarly opinion on this point. 
The author of al-Shamil said: Abu'l-'Abbas and Abu Ishaq said that praying Tarawih in congregation is better than praying it individually , because of the consensus of the Sahabah and the consensus of the scholars of the regions on this point.”
Ibn al-Mubarak, Ahmad and Ishaq favoured praying with the imam during the month of Ramadan. 
It says in Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi: 
“In the book on night prayer (qiyam): it was said to Ahmad ibn Hanbal: Do you prefer a man to pray with the people in Ramadan or on his own? He said: He should pray with the people. He said: And I prefer that he should pray with the imam and pray Witr with him. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If a man prays qiyam with the imam until he finishes, it will be recorded as if he spent the rest of the night (in prayer).” Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “He should pray with the people until he prays Witr with them, and he should not leave until the imam leaves. Abu Dawud said: I saw him (Imam Ahmad) – in the month of Ramadan, praying Witr with his imam, except on one night when I did not attend. Ishaq (may Allah have mercy on him) said: I said to Ahmad: Is praying qiyam in Ramadan in congregation dearer to you or praying on one’s own? He said: I prefer that this prayer should be offered in congregation, so as to revive the Sunnah. And Ishaq said the same.” (See al-Mughni, 1/457) 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said in Majaalis Shahr Ramadan, p. 22: 
“At first the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to pray Tarawih in congregation in the mosque, then he stopped because he feared that it might be made obligatory upon his ummah…”  
Then he quoted the two hadiths quoted above. Then he said: 
“No man should keep away from Tarawih prayer lest he misses out on the reward for it. And he should not leave until the imam finishes Tarawih and Witr , so that he may attain the reward of spending the whole night in prayer.”
Al-Albani said in Qiyam Ramadan: “Rather it (praying Tarawih in congregation) is better than praying it alone, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did it himself and explained its virtue.  
Rather he did not lead them in praying it in congregation for the rest of the month because he feared that praying at night during Ramadan might be made obligatory for them, and they would be unable to do that, as it says in the hadith of `Aishah which is narrated in al-Sahihayn and elsewhere. This concern no longer applied after the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) died and Allah had completed Islam. Hence the reason for not praying in congregation when offering night prayers in Ramadan was no longer present, and the previous ruling remained in effect, which is that it is prescribed to offer this prayer in congregation . Hence ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) revived it, as it says in Sahih al-Bukhari and elsewhere.”
It says in al-Mawsu’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (27/138): 
“From the time of `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), the Rightly-Guided Caliphs and the Muslims regularly offered Tarawih prayer in congregation. ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) is the one who united the people in offering the prayer behind a single imam. 
Asad ibn `Amr ibn Abi Yusuf said: I asked Abu Hanifah about Tarawih and what `Umar did. He said: Tarawih is a confirmed Sunnah, and ‘Umar did not base his decision on speculation and he was not introducing bid’ah (an innovation). He did not enjoin it except because of what he knew from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). `Umar introduced this and gathered the people behind Ubayy ibn Ka’b and he offered this prayer in congregation, at the time when the Companions – the Muhajirin and Ansar – were still alive, and no one among them objected to that, rather they helped him and agreed with him, and also enjoined it.”

45788,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45788,"If he wipes over his socks then takes them off, is his wudu invalidated thereby?","If a person who has wudu wipes over his socks, then takes them off, is his wudu invalidated thereby?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The scholars differed concerning the ruling on one who does wudu and wipes over his socks, then takes them off. 
Some scholars say that it is sufficient for him to wash his feet, and his wudu is completed thereby. 
This is a weak view, because wudu requires continuity, i.e., there should not be a long time between the washing of the various parts, rather they should be washed one after another, in a continuous sequence. 
Hence Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated in al-Mughni (1/367) that this view is based on the idea that there is no need for continuity in wudu, and this is weak. 
Others said that the person’s wudu is invalidated thereby, and if he wants to pray he has to repeat his wudu. They quoted as evidence the fact that wiping takes the place of washing, and if the socks are removed the purity of the feet is no longer valid, because now they are unwashed and unwiped. If the purity of the feet is invalidated then the entire wudu is invalidated because it cannot be divided up. This view was favoured by Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him), as is stated in his Majmoo’ al-Fatawa, 10/113. 
Yet others said that his wudu is not invalidated thereby unless he breaks his wudu in some other way (by breaking wind etc). This was the view of a number of the salaf, including Qataadah, al-Hasan al-Basri and Ibn Abi Layla. It was supported by Ibn Hazm in al-Muhalla (1/105), and was the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and Ibn al-Mundhir. Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmoo’ (1/557): this is the strongest view. 
They quoted a number of things as evidence for that: 
1 – That purity is not invalidated except by hadath (breaking one's wudu by breaking wind etc.) and taking off the socks is not hadath. 
2 – The purity of one who wipes over his socks is established by shar’i evidence, and it cannot be ruled to be invalid except by further shar’i evidence, and there is no evidence to indicate that purity is invalidated by taking off the socks. 
3 – The analogy with shaving the hair after doing wudu. If a person does wudu and wipes over his hair, then shaves his head, he remains in a state of purity and it is not invalidated by that. The same applies to one who wipes over his socks then takes them off. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: 
If a person takes off his socks after wiping over them, his wudu is not invalidated thereby, and he may pray as he likes until he breaks his wudu (hadath), according to the correct view.

1- Is it permissible to attend and accept invitations to these occasions?
2- As 99% of these events are not free of songs, especially those that are accompanied by haraam musical instruments or indecent words, does this mean that we should have nothing to do with them and not attend any such occasions?
3- If we do not attend these parties, does that mean we are severing the ties of kinship, cutting ourselves off from people and causing enmity between us and them?
4- The scholars have stipulated that if we attend these celebrations we must denounce what goes on, but such denunciations receive no response and there is no real opportunity at such times which they claim are times of joy.
5- I hope that you can find the time to explain for us in detail about this matter which is so widespread nowadays.",,,"Praise be to Allah.1 – It is not permissible to attend wedding parties that involve evil actions, such as singing that is accompanied by music or that includes indecent words. The fact that this is widespread among people does not mean that it is permissible and should not be denounced. 
2 – Not attending these parties is not regarded as severing the ties of kinship, rather it is protecting oneself from seeing or hearing evil. Your family and relatives should understand that you would be keen to attend and take part, were it not for the evil things that they do. 
3 – If a person who is invited to such an event knows that there will be evil things happening and that he is not able to denounce them, it is not permissible for him to attend. 
Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (7/214): If a person is invited to a wedding feast in which evil things will take place, such as wine, musical instruments, etc, and he is able to attend and remove those evils, then he must attend and denounce them, because then he will be fulfilling two duties: accepting the invitation of his Muslim brother and removing evil. But if he is not able to denounce them then he should not attend. If he does not know about the evils until he gets there, he should remove them. If he cannot, then he should go away. Something similar was stated by al-Shaafa’i. 
It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah: 
If wedding parties are free of evils such as men mixing with women and indecent songs, or if you attend then these evils will be changed, then it is permissible to attend, so as to share in the occasion of joy. Rather it is obligatory to attend if there is some evil that you can remove. 
But if there are evil things in these parties that you cannot denounce, then it is haraam to attend them because of the general meaning of the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And leave alone those who take their religion as play and amusement, and whom the life of this world has deceived. But remind (them) with it (the Qur’aan) lest a person be given up to destruction for that which he has earned, when he will find for himself no protector or intercessor besides Allaah” [al-An’aam 6:70] 
“And of mankind is he who purchases idle talks (i.e. music, singing) to mislead (men) from the path of Allaah without knowledge, and takes it (the path of Allaah, or the Verses of the Qur’aan) by way of mockery. For such there will be a humiliating torment (in the Hell-fire)”
[Luqmaan 31:6]
And because of the many ahaadeeth which condemn singing and musical instruments.

45793,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45793,He flirted with a girl in Ramaadan and broke his fast to punish himself,"I was living in Europe for a long time, 16 years, until I finished my university studies, and I was 22 years old. During the month of Ramadaan, I met a girl by accident in the university residence, which was mixed. I was fasting but the Shaytaan defeated me and I tried to flirt with her and play with her and kiss her. But then I went back to my room regretting what I had done. Then I said: I am a Muslim and I did this in Ramadaan; because of what I have done, I do not deserve to join the sincere daa’iyahs with whom I used to meet every day, and I do not deserve this goodness. By doing this I have definitely broken the fast, and I probably have to do ghusl because of madhiy. Then I drank some water to punish myself and I broke the fast that day. What should I do? Please advise me, may Allaah reward you with good.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    What happened to you is one of the effects of staying in a 
    kaafir country and studying in a mixed environment. Hence the scholars 
    warned against that a great deal. We praise Allaah for having guided you and 
    protected you from doing anything more serious than that. 

    You made a great mistake by deliberately breaking the fast 
    during the day in Ramadaan. You should have asked Allaah to forgive you for 
    what you did with that girl, and you should have completed your fast. 

    You should note that some of the greatest means that the 
    Shaytaan uses to keep people away from the right path is to keep them from 
    having good friends or from doing good deeds by making them think that they 
    do not deserve that. 

    The result of this keeping away from good deeds and good 
    people may be worse than the sin that led to it in the first place. Hence 
    the wise man is the one who does not let one sin lead him to another, rather 
    he hastens to repent from it and looks for more good people to be close to 
    and does more righteous deeds. “Good deeds erase bad deeds.” 

    With regard to the emission of madhiy (prostatic fluid), this 
    does not invalidate the fast according to the more correct of the two 
    scholarly opinions. This is the view of Abu Haneefah and al-Shaafa’i, and 
    was the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy 
    on him). Al-Mughni, 3/20; al-Ikhtiyaaraat al-Fiqhiyyah, p. 97. 
    See also questions no. 38074. 

    But you are not certain whether you emitted madhiy or not. 

    No ghusl is required in the case of madhiy, but it is naajis 
    (impure) and invalidates wudoo’, and it sufficient to sprinkle water on any 
    affected areas of clothing. See question no.
    34172. 

    You have to make up the day when you broke your fast, and 
    repent to Allaah, but you do not have to offer the burdensome expiation, 
    because that applies only in the case of intercourse, according to the more 
    correct of the two scholarly opinions, which is also the view of al-Shaafa’i 
    and Ahmad. 

    But if you have delayed making up that day until the next Ramadaan comes, then as well as making up the day you have to offer expiation for delaying it, by feeding one poor person half a saa’ of food, which is approximately one and a half kilograms. See question no.
