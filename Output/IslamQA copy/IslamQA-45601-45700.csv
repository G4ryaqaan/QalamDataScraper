45611,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45611,Ruling on following the imam from outside the mosque or following a prayer by listening to the radio,In Ramadaan we saw on TV that some people pray Taraaweeh with the imam of the Haram whilst they are in their homes neighbouring the Haram.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Whoever wants to pray in a mosque in congregation has to go 
    to the mosque, because if he follows the imam in his home this is not prayer 
    in congregation, even if he can see the imam and congregation. Shaykh Ibn 
    ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) has spoken in detail on this 
    issue. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in 
    his commentary on Zaad al-Mustaqni’: 

    The phrase “and the same applies if he is outside and sees 
    the imam or the congregation” means that a person’s following the imam is 
    valid if he is outside the mosque, on condition that he can see the imam or 
    the congregation. The apparent meaning of the author’s words is that it is 
    not conditional upon the rows (of worshippers) being uninterrupted. So if it 
    is assumed that a person is a neighbour of the mosque and he can see the 
    imam or the congregation from his window and he prays in his house, and 
    there is someone with him so that he is not praying alone, then it is valid 
    for him to follow this imam, because he can hear the takbeer and see the 
    imam or the congregation. 

    The apparent meaning of the author’s words is that he has to 
    see the imam or congregation throughout the entire prayer, so that he will 
    not miss following the imam. The view of our madhhab is that it is 
    sufficient for him to see them for part of the prayer. 

    So, if he is outside the mosque, two conditions must be met: 

    1 – That he can hear the takbeer

    2 – That he can see the imam or the congregation, either 
    throughout the entire prayer, according to the apparent meaning of the 
    author’s words, or for part of the prayer, according to the view of our 
    madhhab. 

    The apparent meaning of his words is that it is not essential 
    for the rows (of worshippers) to be uninterrupted, if the person is praying 
    outside the mosque. This is the view of our madhhab. 

    The second view – which is that of the author of al-Muqni’, 
    is that the rows (of worshippers) must be uninterrupted, and that it is not 
    valid for one who is outside the mosque to follow the imam unless the rows 
    are joined to one another, because what counts in congregational prayer is 
    for all the worshippers to be doing the same things at the same time, 
    following one imam in one place. But we say that if the imam and the 
    worshippers are in the same mosque, and there are two other worshippers in 
    another room between which and the mosque there is some distance, and 
    another two in a third room, undoubtedly this is splitting up the 
    congregation, especially according to the view of those who say that prayer 
    in congregation must be offered in the mosque. 

    The correct view with regard to this matter is that it is 
    essential for those who follow the imam from outside the mosque there should 
    be no interruption in the rows; if there is any interruption in the rows 
    then their prayer is not valid. 

    For example: there are buildings around the Haram, in which 
    are apartments in which people pray. Those people can see the imam or the 
    congregation for all or part of the prayer. According to the words of this 
    author, their prayer is valid, but we say to them: if you hear the iqaamah 
    then you can stay where you are and pray with the imam, and not come to 
    al-Masjid al-Haraam. 

    According to the second opinion, the prayer is not valid, 
    because the rows are interrupted. This is the correct view, which refutes 
    the fatwa that stated by some contemporary scholars, that it is permissible 
    to follow the imam in a prayer that is being broadcast. He wrote an essay 
    concerning that, entitled al-Iqnaa’ bi Sihhat Salaat al-Ma’moom khalfa 
    al-midhaa’. This view implies that we need not pray Jumu’ah in the 
    Friday mosques, rather we can follow the imam of al-Masjid al-Haraam, 
    because in that way we will have a larger congregation and that will be 
    better, even though the one who follows a prayer broadcast on the radio 
    cannot see the congregation or the imam, and if it comes by TV which 
    broadcasts the prayer live, it is more likely to be appropriate. 

    But this is undoubtedly a false view, because it leads to 
    abolishing of prayer in congregation and Jumu’ah prayer, and the rows (of 
    worshippers) are interrupted in this case, and it does not achieve the 
    purpose for which the Lawgiver enjoined prayer in congregation and Jumu’ah 
    prayer. 

    The one who follows a broadcast prayer is not praying behind 
    an imam who is in front of him, rather there is a huge distance between 
    them, and this opens the door to evil, because the one who is careless about 
    Jumu’ah prayer could then say that so long as it is valid to follow a prayer 
    broadcast on the radio or TV, then I am going to pray at home, with my son 
    or brother etc, and we will form a row. 

    But the correct view is that it is not valid to follow the 
    prayer outside the mosque unless the rows are uninterrupted, and two 
    conditions must be met: 

    1-That the worshipper can hear 
    the takbeer

    2-That the rows be uninterrupted.
With regard to seeing 
    the imam or congregation, this is a matter that is subject to scholarly 
    debate. But so long as the takbeer can be heard and the rows are 
    uninterrupted, then it is valid to follow the imam. Based on this, if the 
    mosque is full and the rows are uninterrupted, and people pray in the market 
    places and outside shops, there is nothing wrong with that.

45617,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45617,Is it permissible to pray for one who committed suicide?,Is it permissible to offer the funeral prayer for one who committed suicide?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Killing oneself is a major sin, and there are stern warnings addressed to the one who does that, but it does not put one beyond the pale of Islam. In the Sunnah it shows that it is permissible for ordinary people to offer the funeral prayer for one who commits suicide, but it is prescribed for the elite, such as scholars and prominent figures, not to offer the funeral prayer for him, as a rebuke and so as to deter others from doing likewise. It was narrated that Jaabir ibn Samurah said: A man who had killed himself with a broad, sharp-edged arrow was brought to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and he did not offer the funeral prayer for him. Narrated by Muslim (978). 
Al-Nawawi said:  
The scholars said: this hadeeth is to be understood as a deterrent to suicide, just as he did not offer the funeral prayer for one who was in debt, but the Sahaabah offered the funeral prayer for the debtor on the command of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). That was in order to deter others from getting into debt, not because he was a kaafir. According to Maalik it is makrooh to offer the funeral prayer for one who has been stoned to death as a hadd punishment, and one who was immoral, as an expression of disapproval. 
Sharh Muslim, 7/47. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah was asked about a man who claimed to be a holy man, then he saw a snake and some of the people wanted to kill it, but he stopped them, then he picked up the snake trying to do a miraculous deed, but the snake bit him and he died. Is it permissible to offer the funeral prayer for him or not? 
He replied: 
, the Lord of the Worlds. The scholars and people who are religiously committed should not pray for this man and others like him, but the ordinary people should pray for him, just as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) refrained from praying for a man who had committed suicide, and one who had stolen from the war-booty, but he said: “Pray for your companion.” They said to Samurah ibn Jundub: “Your son did not sleep last night.” He said, “Was it because he ate too much?” They said: “Yes.” He said: “If he had died I would not have prayed for him.” Samurah explained that if he died because he had eaten too much, he would not pray for him, because he would have killed himself by eating too much. And it is more appropriate that the scholars and those who are religiously-committed should refrain from offering the funeral prayer for this man who prevented others from killing the snake, and held it in his hand until it killed him, because he killed himself. 
Al-Fataawa al-Kubra, 3/20, 21 
Shaykh al-Islam also said: 
If a person refrains from praying for one of them – i.e., the one who stole from the war-booty, the one who killed himself and the debtor – as a deterrent to others from doing likewise, then that is good.  But if he refrains from praying for him in public but makes du’aa’ for him in private, then he will achieve two ends, which is better than omitting one of them. 
Al-Ikhtiyaaraat al-‘Ilmiyyah, p. 52. 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz was asked: 
Can the funeral prayer be offered for one who kills himself? 
He replied: 
Some of the Muslims should pray for him, as for any other sinner, because he is still a Muslim according to Ahl al-Sunnah. 
Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 13/162. 
And he was asked: 
Should one who killed himself be washed and the funeral prayer offered for him? 
He replied: 
The one who killed himself should be washed and the funeral prayer offered for him, and he should be buried with the Muslims, because he is a sinner, but he is not a kaafir; killing oneself is a sin, it is not kufr. 
If a person kills himself – Allaah forbid – he should be washed and shrouded, and the funeral prayer offered for him, but the ruler and important figures should refrain from offering the funeral prayer for him as an act of denunciation, lest anyone think that they approve of what he did. If the caliph, ruler, judges, governor, mayor etc do not offer the funeral prayer for him as an act of denunciation and a declaration that this was wrong, then that is a good thing, but some of the worshippers should offer the prayer for him.

45618,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45618,The ruling on jihad for women,This is an import matter about which I am confused. What is the ruling on jihad for women?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Jihad is not obligatory for women. Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
In order for jihad to be obligatory there are seven conditions: being Muslim, being an adult, being of sound mind, being free, being male, being physically sound and being able to afford it financially. With regard to being Muslim, adult and of sound mind, these are essential conditions for all Islamic duties, because a kaafir is not to be trusted in jihad, an insane person cannot go for jihad and a child is physically weak. Ibn ‘Umar said: “I presented myself to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) on the day of Uhud when I was fourteen years old, and he did not let me join the fighting.” Agreed upon. … With regard to being male, this is stipulated because of the report narrated from ‘Aa’ishah who said: “O Messenger of Allaah, do women have to engage in jihad? He said: “Jihad in which there is no fighting: Hajj and ‘Umrah.” And because women are not able to fight because they are (physically) weak. 
From al-Mughni, 9/163. 
The hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) was narrated by Ahmad (25361) and Ibn Maajah (2901); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan Ibn Maajah. 
Can a woman go out to help the mujaahideen and treat the wounded? 
Al-Sarkhasi said in Sharh al-Siyar al-Kabeer (1/184): Chapter on women fighting alongside men and being present in war: He said: we do not like women to fight alongside men in war because a woman does not have the right physical make-up for fighting, as the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) indicated when he said: “This one was not a fighter” (said when he saw the body of a woman slain on the battlefield). And when a woman fights, the ‘awrah of the Muslims may become exposed and the mushrikeen will rejoice at that, and that may be a cause of the mushrikeen increasing their hopes of defeating the Muslims, and they may think that the Muslims are weak because they had to bring the women to fight, so they will say, ‘They need the help of women to fight us.” So this should be avoided. For this reason it is not recommended for women to participate directly in the fighting. But if the Muslims have no choice and are forced to do that, because repelling the kuffaar when necessary by whatever means the Muslims have at their disposal, is permissible, rather it is obligatory. The story of Hunayn is quoted as evidence for that. 
At the end of this story it says: Umm Sulaym bint Milhaan, who was fighting that day with a cloth tied around her stomach, said: “O Messenger of Allaah, what do you think about these people who ran away from you and let you down? You should not forgive them if Allaah gives you power over them.” He (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “O Umm Sulaym, the forgiveness of Allaah is immense.” She repeated that three times, and each time the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The mercy of Allaah is immense.” In al-Maghaazi it is narrated that she said: “O Messenger of Allaah, should we not kill these who ran away (from the battlefield) as we killed the mushrikeen?” He (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:  “The forgiveness of Allaah is immense.” What greater need can there be for women to fight than this incident when the men fled and abandoned the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). This clearly shows that there is nothing wrong with women fighting when that is essential, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not prevent this woman from fighting on that occasion. But it is not narrated that he gave the women permission to fight on other occasions. There is nothing wrong with old women being present at times of war to tend the wounded, bring water and cook food for the soldiers if they need that, because of the hadeeth of ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Qarat al-Azdi who said: The womenfolk of Khaalid ibn al-Waleed and the womenfolk of the Sahaabah had their sleeves rolled up, bringing water to the mujaahideen and reciting encouraging poetry, when he was fighting the Byzantines. What is meant here is old women, because young women are not allowed to go out for fear of fitnah, and old women can take care of the needs in such situations. And it was narrated that Umm Mutaa’, who was present at Khaybar with the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), said: I saw Aslam (one of the Arab tribes) when they complained to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about the difficulties they were facing, so he recommended that they engage in jihad and they responded. I saw that Aslam were the first ones to reach the fortress and the sun did not set on that day until Allaah had enabled us to conquer it. 
This clearly shows that she went out with the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and he did not forbid her to do so. From this we know that there is nothing wrong with an old woman going out to help the mujaahideen by doing tasks that are appropriate for them. And Allaah is the Source of strength. End quote. 
It says in Khishshaaf al-Qinaa’ (3/26): Women are not allowed (to engage in jihad) because they are a source of temptation, as well as not being qualified to fight, because of their natural tendency to be weak and cowardly, and because there is no guarantee that the enemy will not capture them and regard it as permissible to do to them that which Allaah has forbidden. Some of the scholars said: except the wife of the ruler or commander, who may be present to attend to his needs, because of the actions of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), or an old women in cases of need only, such as giving water to the troops and treating the wounded, because al-Rubayyi’ bint Mu’awwidh said: “We used to go out to fight with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), bringing water and serving them, bringing back the wounded and the slain to Madeenah.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari. And a similar report was narrated from Anas by Muslim. That is because men may be distracted from these tasks by fighting, so this is a help to the Muslims and supporting them in their fight. 
All of this has to do with jihad in cases where the enemy has not invaded the Muslim land, in which case jihad becomes obligatory on every able-bodied person, man or woman, and a woman may then go out without her husband’s permission. Al-Kaasaani al-Hanafi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “But at times of general mobilization, such as when the enemy is seeking to invade a Muslim land, then it becomes an individual obligation (fard ‘ayn) on every single Muslim who is able to fight, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“March forth, whether you are light (being healthy, young and wealthy) or heavy (being ill, old and poor)”
[al-Tawbah 9:41]
It was said that this was revealed concerning general mobilization. 
And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“It was not [proper] for the people of Madīnah and those surrounding them of the bedouins that they remain behind after [the departure of] the Messenger of Allah or that they prefer themselves over his self.”
[al-Tawbah 9:120]
From Badaa’i’ al-Sanaa’i’, 7/98 
It says something similar in al-Sharh al-Sagheer, one of the Maaliki books (2/274): that if the enemy attacks a Muslim land, then jihad becomes an individual obligation for every man and woman. 
In conclusion: 
Jihad is not obligatory for women in principle, except in cases of necessity, such as if the kuffaar attack a Muslim land, in which case jihad becomes obligatory for women, according to their abilities. If a woman is not able to fight then she is not obliged to do so, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allaah burdens not a person beyond his scope”

45620,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45620,Do her children from breastfeeding have any relationship with her second husband?,"A boy was breastfed by a woman along with her own son, then this woman got divorced and married another man, and had several sons and daughters. Her first husband married another woman and had several sons and daughters. 

My question is: 

I hope that you can tell me who are those who are regarded as the brothers and sisters of this child through breastfeeding – are they the sons and daughters of that woman through breastfeeding or the sons and daughters of the man? Please note that this woman says that she breastfed this boy for several days and her own son nursed from one breast and this boy nursed from the other.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    1 – When the infant has been breastfed by the woman five 
    times within the first two years of life, before weaning, then he becomes 
    her child through breastfeeding, according to the consensus of the imams, 
    and he becomes a mahram for her. The man to whom the milk belongs (because 
    he is the father of the child whose conception and delivery led to 
    production of the milk) becomes a father to the child through breastfeeding, 
    according to the consensus of the well-known scholars. This is proven 
    according to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him). 

    2 – If the man and woman become parents of the child through 
    breastfeeding, then all their children become brothers and sisters to the 
    breastfed child, whether they are children of the father only (from another 
    wife) or of the mother only (from another husband) or from them both, or 
    they are their children through breastfeeding. They all become brothers and 
    sisters of this child through breastfeeding. Even if a man has two wives and 
    one breastfeeds a baby boy and the other breastfeeds a baby girl, these two 
    children become brother and sister and it is not permissible for them to 
    marry one another, according to the consensus of the four Imams and the 
    majority of Muslim scholars. Ibn ‘Abbaas was asked about this matter and 
    said: “The inseminator is one” – i.e., the man who had intercourse with both 
    women, which led to the pregnancies that produced the milk is one and the 
    same. 

    3 – According to Muslim consensus, there is no difference 
    between the children of the woman who were breastfed along with this child 
    and those who were born to her before or after that. 

    See Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 24/31-32 

    4 – There is no paternal relationship between the woman’s 
    children through blood or through breastfeeding and her second husband, 
    i.e., he is not regarded as a father to them through breastfeeding. The milk 
    belongs to the first husband, who is a father to all of them. But her second 
    husband is their mother’s husband and by his marrying her, her daughters by 
    blood become mahrams to him, because they are his stepdaughters (rabaa’ib), 
    and when he has consummated the marriage with their mother they become 
    mahrams to him. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Forbidden to you (for 
    marriage) are: … your stepdaughters under your guardianship, born of your 
    wives to whom you have gone in”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:23]

    With regard to the relationship between the woman’s daughters 
    through breastfeeding and her second husband who was not the owner of the 
    milk, and whether or not they are mahrams for him because he is the husband 
    of their mother – this is a matter concerning which there is a difference of 
    opinion among the scholars. 

    The majority of scholars think that the woman’s daughters 
    through breastfeeding are mahrams for the second husband, because he is the 
    husband of their mother. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah was of the view, and 
    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen agreed with him, that they are not mahrams for him. 

    Based on this, the women who were breastfed by this woman 
    should observe hijab in front of her second husband, because he is not a 
    mahram for them. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: If 
    we examine the view of the majority, which is that it is not permissible for 
    him to marry his wife’s daughter through breastfeeding and the view of 
    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah that she is not a mahram for him, we may draw 
    the conclusion that we should err on the side of caution because that is the 
    approach that is referred to in the Sunnah. Sa’d ibn Abi Waqqaas disputed 
    with ‘Abd ibn Zam’ah concerning a slave of Zam’ah. Sa’d said: “O Messenger 
    of Allaah, this is the son of my brother ‘Utbah ibn Abi Waqqaas, whom he 
    entrusted to my care because he is his son.” ‘Abd ibn Zam’ah said: “This is 
    my brother, the son of my father’s slave woman who was born on my father’s 
    bed.” The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saw that 
    the child clearly resembled ‘Utbah but he said: “He is yours, O ‘Abd ibn 
    Zam’ah. The child belongs to the bed.” Then he said to Sawdah bint Zam’ah, 
    who was one of the Mothers of the Believers (the Prophet’s wives): “Observe 
    hijab from him, O Sawdah.” Al-Bukhaari, 2053; Muslim, 1457. Even though he 
    had ruled that he was a brother of hers, he told her to observe hijab from 
    him because he saw that he clearly resembled ‘Utbah. This was the ruling of 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that was based 
    on erring on the side of caution. He told her to observe hijab because there 
    was some doubt about him, and he ruled that he was her brother because he 
    was born in her father’s bed.

45622,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45622,"Ruling on the imam saying to the congregation, “Pray Pray like a man bidding farewell”","What is the ruling on the imam saying, before the first takbeer of the prayer, “Focus your hearts on Allaah” and “Pray like a man bidding farewell”?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
It is Sunnah for the imam to straighten the rows himself, or to tell the congregation to straighten the rows. A variety of expressions are narrated in the Sunnah, all of them telling the worshippers to straighten the rows, and warning them against doing otherwise. Among the phrases that have been narrated are: “Straighten the rows and stand close together” and “Straighten your rows, for straightening the rows is part of establishing prayer” and “Straighten your rows for straightening the rows is part of perfecting the prayer” and “Straighten the rows in prayer for straightening the rows is part of doing the prayer well” and “Stand straight and do not make the rows uneven, lest that that create disharmony amongst you” and “Straighten the rows and stand shoulder to shoulder and fill the gaps” – and other such phrases. 
There is no need to say any of these or other phrases if the imam sees that the rows are straight. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
But if the imam turns round and sees that the rows are straight and solid (with no gaps), and the people are standing in straight rows, then it seems that he should not tell them to straighten the rows, because that has been done – unless he intends thereby to tell them to keep it like that – because these words have a meaning, they are not just words that are to be said for no purpose. 
As’ilat al-baab il-Maftooh, no. 62. 
We do not know of any phrase in the Sunnah with which the imam may encourage the worshippers to focus more in their prayer and focus their hearts on Allaah and the prayer, as if it were their last prayer and so on. If the imam always says that then there is the fear that it may come under the heading of bid’ah (innovation). There is nothing wrong with saying such things as a reminder but that should be done sometimes, not all the time and in every prayer. 
We know of no basis for saying “Focus your hearts on Allaah”. With regard to the phrase “Pray like a man bidding farewell,” there is a saheeh report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said this, but that was by way of general advice, not what the imam should say before saying the first takbeer of the prayer. 
It was narrated that Abu Ayyoob said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When you stand to pray, pray like a man bidding farewell. Do not say anything for which you will have to apologize. And give up hope for what other people have.” 
Narrated by Ibn Maajah, 4171. Classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 401. 
And it was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Pray like a man bidding farewell as if you can see Him, for although you cannot see Him, He sees you, and do not be concerned about what other people possess, then you will live a rich life. Beware of any action that requires an apology.”
Narrated by al-Bayhaqi in Kitaab al-Zuhd (The Book of Asceticism), 2/210.

Should the zakaah be paid by the owner of the land or the tenant? If the tenant has to pay it, should the zakaah be paid on the total yield or on what is left after paying the rent?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
If the owner of the land cultivates it himself, then he should pay zakaah on whatever it produces. If he gives it or lends it to someone else to cultivate it, then that person should pay zakaah on whatever it produces. 
The scholars differed concerning rented land and whether the zakaah should be paid by the owner or the tenant who cultivates it. The majority were of the view that it should be paid by the one who cultivates it; the Hanafis were of the view that it should be paid by the owner. 
Ibn Hazm said: 
There is no zakaah on dates, wheat or barley unless a man has five wasqs of one type of them. A wasq is sixty saa’s, and a saa’ is four mudds of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). A mudd is somewhere between one and a half and one and a quarter ratls. This applies whether he grew it on land belonging to him or land belonging to someone else, whether he took that land by force or by means of a valid deal or an invalid deal, whether the land was taxable land or land on which one-tenth of the produce is to be paid. 
This is the view of the majority, and of Maalik, al-Shaafa’i, Ahmad and Abu Sulaymaan. 
Abu Haneefah said: He should pay zakaah regardless of the amount, whether it is a little or a lot. If the land is classed as kharaaj land (taxable land) then there is no zakaah on its produce. If the land is rented then the zakaah should be paid by the owner of the land, not the one who cultivates it. 
Al-Muhalla, 4/47 
The imam refuted the view of the Hanafis and explained that the zakaah is to be paid on the produce and not on the land, as the Hanafis say. 
Ibn Qudaamah al-Maqdisi said: 
Whoever rents land and cultivates it, the one-tenth should be paid by him and not by the owner of the land. This is the view of Maalik, al-Thawri, Shareek, Ibn al-Mubaarak, al-Shaafa’i and Ibn al-Mundhir. 
Abu Haneefah said: (Zakaah) should be paid by the owner of the land, because it is part of the maintenance costs of the land, so it is like a kharaaj or tax. 
Our view is that it should be paid on the produce, so it should be paid by the grower of the produce, like zakaah on the value of goods that are prepared for sale, and like the one-tenth on produce that he owns. Their view that it is part of the maintenance costs of the land is not correct, because if that were the case, zakaah would be due on the land even if it were not cultivated, like the kharaaj tax, and it would be obligatory on dhimmis too, like the kharaaj, and it would be based on the value of the land, not on the value of the produce, and it would have to be spent in areas in which booty may be spent, not in areas in which zakaah may be spent. 
Al-Mughni, 2/313, 314 
This is the view favoured by Ibn ‘Uthaymeen in al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 6/88 
Secondly: 
As zakaah is due on the produce, he has to pay the zakaah on the entire harvest, if it reaches the minimum threshold (nisaab), which is five wasqs. A wasq is sixty saa’s, which is equivalent to approximately 657 kilograms. 
The one who is paying the zakaah has no right to deduct the rent of the land even if that is after he sold the produce – whether out of ignorance, by mistake or as the result of a misunderstanding – before paying zakaah. 
The correct scholarly view is that no cost that he spent on the land should be deducted from the zakaah. 
Ibn Hazm said: 
It is not permissible for the one who has produce or dates to deduct what he spent on tilling, harvesting, gathering, threshing, manure, digging etc from the zakaah, whether he took out a loan for that or not, or whether the total costs were greater than the value of the harvest or not. This is a matter concerning which the earlier generations disputed… [Here Ibn Hazm mentioned the dispute in detail, then he said:] 
Abu Muhammad said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stated that zakaah must be paid on the total amount of dates, wheat and barley, if it reached the minimum threshold (nisaab), which is five wasqs or more. The zakaah is not waived because of the expenditure of the grower or owner of the date-palms. It is not permissible to cancel out a duty enjoined by Allaah if there is no Qur’aanic text or proven hadeeth to that effect. This is the view of Maalik, al-Shaafa’i, Abu Haneefah and our companions.

45632,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45632,Should she testify to something that she has not been asked for but that may benefit the person against whom she is testifying?,"I work in a department and it so happened that one of the men insulted the head of the department. I was present with a group of other people, so they asked us to testify. I will testify and – in sha Allah – I will tell the truth which is that he – may Allaah guide him – insulted her openly and in front of her; he cursed her father and her. After he went out, when they dragged him out, she said: “I’ll show you, O So and so,” i.e., a threat – but he did not hear her, so he did not say that she had said, “I’ll show you,” because he was nowhere near the desk then. I was the one who was nearby and heard it. Should I say that when the matter is investigated? I hope to receive a reply.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    This phrase (“I’ll show you”) is a threat but what may be 
    meant by it is to make an official complaint, which is in fact what 
    happened. We do not think that it matters if you tell them or not when the 
    matter is investigated. 

    If she added any other words to it, such as insults or 
    condemnation of the one who insulted her, then you should mention that, 
    because she may have taken her rights by saying these words or more, and it 
    is not right to punish him when the other person has already settled the 
    score. Responding to an insult in kind is a kind of taking one's rights or 
    settling the score, as al-Nawawi said in his commentary on the words of the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “When two people 
    trade insults, the sin will be on the one who started it, unless the one who 
    has been wronged went too far in returning the insults.” Muslim 4688. 
    Al-Nawawi said: They said:  If the one who has been insulted return the 
    insult then the matter is settled, and the first one owes nothing to the 
    second one, but the sin of initiating the insults remains on him. And it was 
    said: He will be free from any sin if the other person returns the insult 
    but the blame will still be on the initiator, but not the sin.  

    If what was said in response is not as bad as what was said, 
    then the matter is not settled, however by responding, part of the matter is 
    settled. This may remove or reduce the punishment for the one who insulted 
    the other first. 

    Islam commands us to be just with all people. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and let not the enmity 
    and hatred of others make you avoid justice. Be just: that is nearer to 
    piety; and fear Allaah. Verily, Allaah is Well‑Acquainted with what you do”

45643,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45643,Questions about the Black Stone,"I read an article about the Black Stone and I want to make sure about the soundness of the hadeeths and reports and whether they can be accepted or they are fabricated (mawdoo’). May Allaah reward you with good. 
The article says: 
Believe it or not. 
Yes, there is only one Stone on earth that floats on water. It is the Black Stone that is situated in the south-east corner of the honoured Ka’bah in the Sanctuary of Makkah al-Mukarramah. Jalaal al-Suyooti said: When al-Mutee’ Lillaah bought the black Stone from Abu Taahir al-Qarmati, the hadeeth scholar ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Ukaym came and said: “We have two signs in our stone: it floats on water and it does not get hot in the fire.” So he brought a stone that had been rubbed with perfume and wrapped in brocade to make him think that this was the Black Stone. They placed it in water and it sank; then they put it in the fire and it cracked. Then he brought another stone and did likewise to it, and the same things happened. Then he brought the Black Stone and put it in water, and it floated; then he put it in the fire and it did not get hot. ‘Abd-Allaah said: “This is our Stone.” Abu Taahir al-Qarmati was amazed by this and said: “How did you know that?” ‘Abd-Allaah said: “It was narrated that the Messenger of Allaah SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘The Black Stone is Allaah’s right hand on His earth. It will come on the Day of Resurrection with a tongue with which it will testify about those who kissed it in sincerity or otherwise. It does not sink in water and it does not get hot in fire…’” 
The Black Stone is the point at which tawaaf begins, at the south-eastern corner of the honoured Ka’bah. It was originally one of the precious stones of Paradise. Its original colour is white like the maqaam (Maqaam Ibraaheem). It is the place where tears should be shed, and where du’aa’s are answered. It is Sunnah to touch it and kiss it. It is the right hand of Allaah on His earth in the sense that it is the place where a man renews his covenant with Allaah and his repentance. On the Day of Resurrection it will testify for all those who touched it. Whoever swears an oath whilst touching it, it is like  touching the Hand of the Most Merciful, and touching it erases sins. It is the place touched by the lips of the Prophets, the righteous and pilgrims performing Hajj and ‘Umrah and visiting the holy places. Glory be to Allaah the Almighty.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
The Black Stone is the stone which is inset into the south-eastern corner of the honoured Ka’bah on the outside, in a setting of silver. It is the starting-point for tawaaf. Currently it is a meter and a half above the ground. 
What is mentioned in the article quoted in the question is true in part, and there is sound (saheeh) evidence for that, but other things mentioned are not true and have no basis. 
We have quoted in the answer to question no. 1902 most of the reports narrated in the Saheeh Sunnah concerning the Black Stone. For example, Allaah sent the Black Stone down to earth from Paradise, and it was whiter than milk, but the sins of the sons of Adam turned it black; it will come on the Day of Resurrection with two eyes with which it will see and a tongue with which it will speak and will testify for those who touched it in truth and sincerity. Touching it, kissing it or pointing to it is the first thing that a person does when he wants to circumambulate the Ka’bah (tawaaf), whether he is doing Hajj or ‘Umrah or a voluntary tawaaf. The Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) kissed it, and his ummah followed him in doing so. If a person is unable to kiss it he should touch it with his hand or with something, and then kiss that thing. If he is unable to do that he should point to it with his hand and say Allaahu akbar. Touching the Stone is one of the things by means of which Allaah erases sins. 
Secondly: 
With regard to the story of the Qaraamitah stealing the Black Stone and keeping it with them for a long time, this is true. Ibn Katheer said, concerning the events of 278 AH: 
In this year the Qaraamitah – who are a heretical sect that follows Persian philosophy and believes that Zaradasht and Mazdak, who used to permit forbidden things, are prophets – started their trouble.
As well as that, they blindly follow everyone who speaks falsehood. The group they managed to corrupt the most were the Raafidis because they are the least wise of people. They are also called Ismaa’eelis (Ismailis) because they are named after Ismaa’eel al-A’raj ibn Ja’far al-Saadiq. 
They are also called al-Qaraamitah. It was said that they are named after Qarmat ibn al-Ash’ath al-Baqqaar; and it was said that in the beginning their leader used to tell them to pray fifty times a day, so as to distract them from what he was really up to. 
What is meant is that this group became active in this year, then things got worse and reached alarming proportions – as we shall see – when they entered al-Masjid al-Haraam and shed the blood of the pilgrims inside the Mosque around the Ka’bah, and they broke the Black Stone and removed it from its position, and took it with them to their homeland in 317 AH, and it stayed with them until 339 AH, so it was absent from its place in the Ka’bah for 22 years. To Allaah we belong and verily unto Him is our return. 
Al-Bidaayah wa’l-Nihaayah, 11/72, 73 
Thirdly: 
With regard to what was mentioned about the Black Stone being the place where tears should be shed, there is a hadeeth to that effect narrated by Ibn Maajah (2945) from Ibn ‘Umar, who said: The Messenger of Allaah SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) turned to face the Stone, then he put his lips on it and wept for a long time. Then he turned and saw ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab weeping. He said: “O ‘Umar, this is the place where tears should be shed.” But this is a weak (da’eef) hadeeth as stated by al-Albaani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel, 111. He said: (it is) da’eef jiddan (very weak). 
With regard to the hadeeth about the Black Stone being Allaah’s Right Hand on earth, the answer to that is that it is a false (baatil) hadeeth which is not proven from the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
Ibn al-Jawzi said in al-‘Ilal al-Mutanaahiyah: This hadeeth is not saheeh. 
Al-‘Ilal by Ibn Al-Jawzi, 2/575. see also Talkhees al-‘Ilal by al-Dhahabi (p. 191).  
Ibn al-‘Arabi said: it is a false hadeeth to which no attention should be paid. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: It was narrated from the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with an isnaad that cannot be proven; based on that there is no need to discuss its meaning. 
Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 6/397. 
Fourthly: 
With regard to what is mentioned about the Black Stone floating on water, and that it does not become hot in the fire, and that it is the place where du’aa’s are answered – there is no basis for any of this in the Sunnah.

    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    did not marry Maariyah al-Qibtiyyah, rather she was his concubine. The 
    Muqawqis, the ruler of Egypt, gave her as gift to him after the Treaty of 
    al-Hudaybiyah. 

    It is permissible to have intercourse with a slave woman, 
    even if she is not Muslim, because she is part of “what one's right hand 
    possesses,” and Allaah has permitted “what one's right hand possesses” 
    without stipulating that the slave woman be a Muslim. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And those who guard their chastity (i.e. private parts, 
    from illegal sexual acts)

    6. Except from their wives or (the slaves) that their 
    right hands possess,.. 
    for then, they are free from blame”

    [al-Mu’minoon 23:5-6]
With regard to marrying a 
    Christian or Jewish woman, this is permissible according to the text of the 
    Qur’aan. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Made lawful to you this day are At‑Tayyibaat [all kinds 
    of Halaal (lawful) foods, which Allaah has made lawful (meat of slaughtered 
    eatable animals, milk products, fats, vegetables and fruits)]. The food 
    (slaughtered cattle, eatable animals) of the people of the Scripture (Jews 
    and Christians) is lawful to you and yours is lawful to them. (Lawful to you 
    in marriage) are chaste women from the believers and chaste women from those 
    who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before your time when you 
    have given their due Mahr (bridal-money given by the husband to his wife at 
    the time of marriage), desiring chastity (i.e. taking them in legal wedlock) 
    not committing illegal sexual intercourse, nor taking them as girlfriends”

    [al-Maa’idah 5:5]

    Ibn al-Qayyim said: 

    It is permissible to marry a woman from the People of the 
    Book. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “(Lawful to you in marriage) are chaste [muhsan] women 
    from the believers and chaste women from those who were given the Scripture 
    (Jews and Christians) before your time”

    [al-Maa’idah 5:5]
Muhsan here means chaste; 
    the same word is also used in Soorat al-Nisa’ to describe married women, who 
    are forbidden in marriage to anyone else. And it was said that the chaste 
    women to whom marriage is permitted is free women, so slave women from the 
    People of the Book are not permissible. However, the first view is the one 
    which is correct, for several reasons… 

    The point is that Allaah has permitted us to marry chaste 
    women from among the People of the Book, and the companions of the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did that. ‘Uthmaan married 
    a Christian woman, as did Talhah ibn ‘Ubayd-Allaah; and Hudhayfah married a 
    Jewish woman. 
‘Abd-Allaah ibn Ahmad 
    said: I asked my father about a Muslim man who married a Christian or Jewish 
    woman. He said: I do not like for him to do it, but if he does, then some of 
    the companions of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) did that too. 

    Ahkaam Ahl al-Dhimmah, 2/794, 
    795. 

    Although we say that it is permissible, and we do not doubt 
    that there is a clear text concerning that, nevertheless we do not think 
    that a Muslim should marry a kitaabi woman (a woman of the people of the 
    Book), for several reasons: 

    1 – One of the conditions of marriage to a kitaabi woman is 
    that she should be chaste, but there are very few chaste women to be found 
    in those environments. 

    2 – One of the conditions of marriage to a kitaabi woman is 
    that the Muslim man should be in charge of the family. But what happens 
    nowadays in that those who marry women from kaafir countries marry them 
    under their laws, and there is a great deal of injustice in their systems. 
    They do not recognize a Muslim’s authority over his wife and children, and 
    if the wife gets angry with her husband she will destroy his household and 
    take the children away, with the support of the laws of her land and with 
    the help of their embassies in most countries. It is no secret that the 
    Muslim countries have no power to resist the pressure of those countries and 
    their embassies. 

    3 – The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) encouraged us to look for Muslim wives who are religiously committed. 
    If a woman is Muslim but is not religiously committed and of good character, 
    then the Muslim is not encouraged to marry her, because marriage is not 
    simply the matter of physical enjoyment only, rather it is the matter of 
    Allaah’s rights and the spouse’s rights, and preserving his household, his 
    honour and his wealth, and bringing up his children. How can a man who 
    marries a kitaabi woman be certain that his sons and daughters will be 
    raised according to Islam when he is leaving them in the hands of this 
    mother who does not believe in Allaah and associates others with Him? 

    Hence even though we say that it is permissible to marry a 
    kitaabi woman, it is not encouraged and we do not advise it, because of the 
    negative consequences that result from that. The wise Muslim should choose 
    the best woman to bear his children and think in the long term about his 
    children and their religious upbringing. He should not let his desire or 
    worldly interests or transient outward beauty blind him to reality; true 
    beauty is the beauty of religious commitment and good morals. 

    He should realize that if he forsakes these type of women for 
    the sake of that which is better for his religious commitment and that of 
    his children, Allaah will compensate him with something better, because 
    “Whoever gives up something for the sake of Allaah, Allaah will compensate 
    him with something better than that, as the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us, the one who speaks the truth and 
    does not speak of his own whims and desires. Allaah is the source of 
    strength and the One Who guides to the Straight Path.

Please tell me of ways and means of avoiding getting angry quickly. May Allah reward you with good.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Allah has commanded us to honour our parents and treat them kindly in word and deed, and he has forbidden us to offend them in word and deed, even in the slightest manner. 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. And that you be dutiful to your parents. If one of them or both of them attain old age in your life, say not to them a word of disrespect, nor shout at them but address them in terms of honour.
24. And lower unto them the wing of submission and humility through mercy, and say: ‘My Lord! Bestow on them Your Mercy as they did bring me up when I was young.’” [al-Isra’ 17:23-24]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) advised us not to get angry, i.e., to avoid the causes that lead to that and to be careful of what may result from that.  
It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that a man said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Advise me.” He said: “Do not get angry.” He repeated his question several times and he said: “Do not get angry.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5765. 
The Muslim should be above getting angry for his own sake or for the sake of anyone other than Allah, because that may lead to regrettable consequences either in this world or in the Hereafter, or in both. 
Ibn Muflih al-Hanbali said: 
‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him) said: It may be known whether a person is really patient at the time of anger. And he used to say that the beginning of anger is madness and the end of it is regret, and anger cannot be justified by offering a humble apology. Calamities may come because of anger. It was said to al-Shu’bi: Why is a person who is quick to get angry also quick to calm down, and the one who is slow to get angry is slow to clam down. He said: Because anger is like fire; that which is easier to start is easier to extinguish. 
Al-Adaab al-Shar’iyyah, 1/183 
If something happens to a Muslim that makes him angry, he should remember the advice of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Do not get angry,” as if the hadeeth applies directly to him. And he should remember that Allah has commanded him to treat his parents well and has forbidden him to offend them, as if he has heard that from Him directly. 
There are means of soothing anger if it arises, which will enable the one who does them to cure himself of anger and its effects. Al-Maawirdi mentioned a good number of them when he said: 
“Remember that there are means of soothing anger if it arises, which a person may use to help himself become patient. These include: 
1 – Remembering Allah, which should make him fear Him; this fear will motivate him to obey Him, so he will resume his good manners, at which point his anger will fade. 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And remember your Lord when you forget” [al-Kahf 18:24]
‘Ikrimah said: i.e., when you get angry. And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And if an evil whisper comes to you from Shaytaan (Satan), then seek refuge with Allah” [al-A’raaf 7:200]
i.e., if the Shaytaan makes you angry – then seek refuge with Allah, for He is the All-Hearer, All-Knower – i.e., He hears the ignorance of the ignorant and He knows the things that take anger away from you. 
One of the wise men said: Whoever remembers the power of Allah will not use his own power to wrong the slaves of Allah. ‘Abd-Allah ibn Muslim ibn Muhaarib said to Haroon al-Rasheed: “O Ameer al-Mu’mineen, I ask You by the One before Whom you are more insignificant than I am before you, and by the One Who has more power to punish you than you have to punish me: why don’t you let me off?” So he left him off, because he had reminded him of the power and might of Allah. 
2 – He should get out of the situation he is in, so that his anger will dissipate because of his moving away from that situation. 
It was narrated that Abu Dharr said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to us: “If one of you gets angry when he is standing, let him sit down, and if that does not take away his anger, then let him lie down.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 4782; classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
3 – He should remember what anger leads to of regret and the need to apologize. 
One of the literary figures said: Beware of the pride of anger, for it leads to the humiliation of apology. 
4 – He should remember the reward for forgiving others and of being tolerant, so he should force himself to overcome his anger, seeking that reward and so as to avoid deserving blame and punishment. Raja’ ibn Haywah said to ‘Abd al-Malik ibn Marwaan, when he had the power to capture some of his enemies: “Allah has given you the victory that you wanted, so give Allah what He wants of forgiveness.” A man said something that ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez disliked to hear, so ‘Umar said: “You wanted the Shaytaan to provoke me because of my position so that I would be harsh with you and in return you would harm me tomorrow (i.e., on the Day of Resurrection). Go away, may Allah have mercy on you.” 
5 – He should remind himself of the way that people like and respect him, and he should not risk losing that because of his anger, so that people change their minds about him. He should know that by forgiving people he will only increase the respect with which they view him.
As the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah will not increase a person who forgives others except in honour.” Narrated by Muslim, 2588.  
And one of the poets said:
“It is not a trait of nobility to be swift in seeking revenge.
And generosity does not lead to a loss of blessings.”

45648,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45648,He did not know that ghusl from janaabah is obligatory; should he repeat the prayers?,I did not know that it is obligatory to do ghusl from janaabah (full ablution following sexual activity) in order to pray. Do I have to repeat the prayers?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Every Muslim, male or female, has to learn the rulings of Islam, especially those that have to do with the duties that Allah has enjoined upon him and that he is able to do. Whoever has wealth has to learn the rulings on zakaah; whoever works in business has to learn the rulings on buying and selling. And everyone has to learn the correct beliefs and what is required of every accountable person, the rulings on purification and prayer. Allah has made it easy for us to seek knowledge in various ways, so many people have no excuse for saying that they did not know, except negligence. 
With regard to this particular matter, which is not knowing that it is obligatory to do ghusl from janaabah, and that you offered many prayers whilst in this state, the scholars are of the view that this is regarded as something that may be excused, so you do not have to make up the prayers. But you have to do ghusl and repeat the prayer at the time of which you hear of the ruling. They quoted several reports as evidence for that: 
1 – It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) entered the mosque and a man entered and prayed and greeted the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) with salaam and he returned the greeting. Then he said: “Go back and pray, for you have not prayed.” So he went back and prayed as he had prayed the first time. Then he came and greeted the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) with salaam and he said: “Go back and pray for you have not prayed.” This happened three times, then he said: “By the One Who sent you with the truth, I cannot do any better; teach me.” He said: “When you stand to pray, say takbeer (“Allahu akbar”), then recite whatever you can of Qur’aan, then bow until you are at ease in bowing, then stand up until you are standing straight. Then prostrate until you are at ease in prostration, then sit up until you are at ease in sitting, and do that throughout the whole prayer.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 724; Muslim, 367. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not tell him to make up his past prayers, rather he told him to make up the current prayer only. 
2 – It was narrated that ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Abza said: A man came to ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab and said: I have become junub but I cannot find any water. ‘Ammaar ibn Yaasir said to ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab: “Do you not remember when we were on a journey, you and I (and became junub)? You did not pray, but I rolled in the dust and prayed. I mentioned that to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘It would have been sufficient for you to do this,’ and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) struck his palms on the ground and blew onto them, then he wiped them over his face and hands.”
Narrated by al-Bukhari, 331; Muslim, 368. 
‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allah be pleased with him) did not pray because he did not know that tayammum is obligatory for the one who cannot find water. ‘Ammaar ibn Yaasir (may Allah be pleased with him) did tayammum in a different way because he did not know how to do tayammum correctly. But the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not tell them to make up the prayers that they had missed. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: 
Based on this, if a person did not purify himself as prescribed in sharee’ah because the text had not reached him, such as if he ate camel meat and did not do wudu, then the text reached him and he came to know that it is obligatory to do wudu after eating camel meat, or if he prayed in a camel pen then the text reached him (which says that it is not allowed to pray in camel pens), does he have to repeat the past prayers? There are two opinions, both of which were narrated from Ahmad. 
A similar case is if a man touches his penis and prays, then he finds out that the one who touches his penis has to do wudu. 
The correct view in all these cases is that he does not have to repeat the prayers, because Allah has forgiven things done by mistake or out of forgetfulness, and because He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger (to give warning)” [al-Isra’ 17:15]
If a person has not heard of the command of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) concerning a particular matter, then the obligation is not confirmed in his case. Hence when ‘Umar and ‘Ammaar became junub and ‘Umar did not pray and ‘Ammaar prayed after rolling in the dust, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not tell either of them to repeat the prayer. Similarly he did not tell Abu Dharr to repeat the prayers when he was junub and did not pray for several days. And he did not tell those of his companions who had eaten until they could distinguish the white thread from the black thread to make up their fasts, and he did not tell those who had prayed facing Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem) before news of the abrogation reached them to make up those prayers. 
A similar case is that of the woman who was suffering from istihaadah (non-menstrual vaginal bleeding) and had not prayed for some time because she thought that she did not have to pray. There are two views as to whether such a woman has to make up the prayers she missed. One view is that she does not have to make up the prayers – as was narrated from Maalik and others – because when the woman who was suffering from istihaadah said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “I have been bleeding heavily for some time and it prevents me from praying and fasting,” he told her what she should do in the future, and he did not tell her to make up the prayers of the past. 
It seems to me, based on mutawaatir reports, that with regard to women and men living in the desert and elsewhere who have reached the age of puberty and do not know that prayer is obligatory for them, and even if it is said to such a woman, “You have to pray” and she says, “Not until I grow up and become an old woman, thinking that the command to pray is only addressed to old women, and even the followers of some shaykhs (among the Sufis) groups do not know that prayer is obligatory for them, according to the correct view, they do not make to make up past prayers regardless of whether it is said that they were kaafirs or they were excused for their ignorance.

See also the answer to question no. 21806 . 
It may be noted here that if the questioner was in a place where the means of acquiring knowledge were available but he was careless and did not try to find out, then he has to make up the prayers that he offered without ghusl from janaabah, so long as he is not very old. If he is very old, he does not have to make them up because of the hardship that that would cause, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“and [Allah] has not laid upon you in religion any hardship” [al-Hajj 22:78]

When the Khutbah has begun, some worshippers come in and say Salam, and the Imam returns the greeting in a low voice. Is this permissible?","Those who attend Jumu`ah prayers have to be silent and listen attentively to the Imam. It is not permissible to talk during the Khutbah except in the cases indicated by the evidence, such as speaking to the Khatib or responding to him, or in cases of necessity such as saving a blind man from falling and so on.","Is talking during the Khutbah permissible?


When can you talk during the Khutbah?


Can you say Yarhamuk-Allah and return Salam during the Khutbah?","Praise be to Allah.Is talking during the Khutbah permissible?
Those who attend Jumu`ah prayer should be quiet and listen attentively to the Imam when he is preaching. It is not permissible to speak to others, even if that is to tell them to be quiet. Whoever does that has engaged in idle talk, and whoever engages in idle talk, his Jumu`ah prayer does not count. 
Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If you say to your companion when the Imam is preaching on Friday, ‘Be quiet and listen,’ you have engaged in idle talk.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 892 and Muslim, 851)
This prohibition also applies to responding to a question about Islam, let alone any other kind of speech that has to do with worldly matters. 
Abu Ad-Darda’ (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sat on the pulpit and addressed the people, and he recited a verse. Ubayy ibn Ka`b was next to me, so I said to him: “O Ubayy, when was this verse revealed?” But he refused to speak to me, so I asked him again and he refused to speak to me, until the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came down (from the pulpit). Then Ubayy said to me: “You have gained nothing from your Jumu`ah except idle talk.” When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had finished (the prayer), I went to him and told him (what had happened). He said: “Ubayy was right. When you hear your Imam speaking, then keep quiet and listen attentively until he has finished.” (Narrated by Ahmad, 20780 and Ibn Majah, 1111; classed as authentic by Al-Busayri and Al-Albani in Tamam Al-Minnah, p. 338) 
This indicates that it is obligatory to remain silent and listen attentively, and that it is forbidden to speak while the Imam is delivering the Khutbah on Friday. 
Ibn ‘Abd Al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “There is no dispute among the scholars of all regions that it is obligatory to remain silent and listen attentively to the Khutbah, for those who hear it.” (Al-Istidhkar, 5/43) 
Some of them held an odd opinion and said that it is not obligatory, but they have no evidence to support their view. 
Ibn Rushd (may Allah have mercy on him) said, concerning the ruling on remaining silent and listening attentively to the Khutbah: 
“With regard to those who do not regard it as obligatory, I do not know that they have any argument except that the suggestion that it is obligatory may seem to contradict the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “So, when the Qur’an is recited, listen to it, and be silent” [Al-A`raf 7:204] – i.e., that it is not obligatory to remain silent for anything except the Quran. There is some weakness in this argument, and Allah knows best. It is very likely that this Hadith did not reach them.” (Bidayat Al-Mujtahid, 1/389) 
When can you talk during the Khutbah?
An exception is made from that in the case of speaking to the Imam, or the Imam speaking to the worshippers for some important reason. 
Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The people were afflicted with a drought at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and whilst the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was delivering the Khutbah one Friday, a Bedouin stood up and said: “O Messenger of Allah, our wealth has been destroyed and our children are starving. Pray to Allah for us.” So he raised his hands [and made Du’a’]. And it rained that day and the next and the next and the next, until the following Friday, when that Bedouin – or he said, someone else – stood up and said: “O Messenger of Allah, our houses have been destroyed and our wealth drowned. Pray to Allah for us.” So he raised his hands… (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 891and Muslim, 897) 
Jabir ibn ‘Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: A man came whilst the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was addressing the people on Friday, and he [the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)] said: “Have you prayed, O So and so?” He said, “No.” He said: “Stand up and pray two Rak’ahs.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 888 and Muslim, 875) 
Whoever quotes these Hadits as evidence that it is permissible for worshippers to speak to one another and that it is not obligatory to remain silent, is not correct.  
Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“What they quote as evidence may be understood as referring only to the one who speaks to the Imam or to whom the Imam speaks, because that does not distract anyone from listening to his Khutbah. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked him, “Have you prayed?” and he replied; and ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) asked ‘Uthman (may Allah be pleased with him) a question, when he came in whilst he (`Umar) was preaching, and `Uthman answered. Thus we should understand these reports in this manner, in order to reconcile the reports. It is not correct to draw an analogy with anything else, because when the Imam speaks, he interrupts his Khutbah, so he is not talking to the other person during the Khutbah as such, unlike when others speak during the Khutbah.” (Al-Mughni, 2/85) 
Can you say Yarhamuk-Allah and return Salam during the Khutbah?
With regard to saying Yarhamuk-Allah (may Allah have mercy on you) to one who sneezes or returning Salam whilst the Imam is delivering the Khutbah, the scholars differed concerning that. 
Al-Tirmidhi said in his Sunan, following the Hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), “If you say to your companion…”: 
They differed concerning returning Salam and saying Yarhamuk-Allah (may Allah have mercy on you) to one who sneezes. Some scholars granted a concession allowing returning Salam and saying Yarhamuk-Allah (may Allah have mercy on him) to one who sneezes whilst the Imam is delivering the Khutbah . This is the view of Ahmad and Ishaq (may Allah have mercy on them). But some of the scholars among the Tabi’in and others regarded that as disliked. This is the view of Al-Shafa’i (may Allah have mercy on him). 
It says in Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah (8/242): 
“It is not permissible to say Yarhamuk-Allah (may Allah have mercy on you) to one who sneezes or to return Salam whilst the Imam is delivering the Khutbah , according to the correct scholarly opinion, because both of them involve speaking, which is forbidden when the Imam is delivering the Khutbah, because of the general meaning of the Hadith.” 
It also says (8/243): 
“It is not permissible for the one who enters whilst the Imam is delivering the Khutbah on Friday , if he can hear the Khutbah, to greet the people in the mosque, and those in the mosque should not return his greeting whilst the Imam is delivering the Khutbah.” 
And it says (8/244): 
“It is not permissible to speak whilst the khatib is delivering the Friday sermon except for one who speaks to the Imam for an important reason.” 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“It is prohibited to give Salam during the Friday Khutbah, so it is not permissible for one who enters the mosque whilst the Imam is delivering the Khutbah to give Salam, and it is also prohibited to return the greeting.” (Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 16/100) 
Shaykh Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“If someone says “Be quiet!”, this is not regarded as idle talk from a linguistic point of view, because it comes under the heading of enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil. However the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) called it idle talk that is not permissible. This comes under the heading of giving precedence to what is more important (namely being silent and listening to the preaching of the khatib) over what is important (namely enjoining what is good during the Khutbah). As this is the case, everything that comes under the heading of enjoining what is good comes under the same ruling as enjoining what is good – so how about if it is of less importance than that? Undoubtedly in that case it is more appropriate that it not be allowed and it comes under the heading of idle talk.” (Al-Ajwibah An-Nafi’ah, p. 45) 
In conclusion, those who attend Jumu`ah prayers have to be silent and listen attentively to the Imam. It is not permissible to speak whilst the Imam is delivering the Khutbah , except in the cases indicated by the evidence, such as speaking to the khatib or responding to him, or in cases of necessity such as saving a blind man from falling and so on. 
Greeting the Imam with Salam or returning the greeting of one who comes in also comes under this prohibition, because there is no concession allowing one to speak with the Imam except in cases of need, which does not include giving or returning greetings. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti` (5/140): 
""It is not permissible for the Imam to say anything that serves no purpose, rather it should be for a reason connected with the prayer or other suitable topics. But if the Imam says something that serves no purpose, that is not permissible. 
If there is a need, then it is permissible. For example, if a listener does not understand something that the khatib says in his Khutbah, or if the khatib makes a mistake in reciting a verse that alters the meaning, or if he omits a phrase from a verse, and so on.  
Other reasons in which the Imam may speak for a purpose include problems with the loudspeakers, in which the Imam may speak to the engineer and ask him to see what is wrong.""

45653,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45653,What should he do with a tenant who does not want to leave the house?,"We are a family whose breadwinner has died, and he left us some property. Some people have been living in this property for a long time, 18 years, for a rent of 40 Egyptian pounds. Allaah has blessed these tenants with wealth and made them so well-off that they own property themselves. One of them has put the property in his sons’ names, another has put it in his wife’s name. We are in great need of those apartments, so I went to them and asked them to vacate the apartments, and I explained the situation to them, but all I got from them was a refusal to budge. One of them asked for a huge amount of money in return for leaving. I tried to talk to them several times but without success. The law in our country is on their side. After that I asked them for more rent so that we can meet our own living expenses, but that also met with no success. What should I do?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    The reason why such problems arise between landlord and 
    tenant is the failure to adhere to the laws of Allaah when drawing up 
    signing the lease. One of the things in which many people go against 
    sharee’ah, causing them a lot of problems, is not defining the period of 
    rental, because defining the period of rental prevents disputes and protects 
    the rights of both sides; it obliges the landlord to let the tenant stay in 
    the property and it obliges the tenant to pay the rent to the landlord for 
    the duration of the rental period, and it obliges him to adhere to the terms 
    of the lease and pay the rent even if he does not use the property. 

    Ibn Qudaamah said: 

    There is no dispute among the scholars concerning the fact 
    that it is permissible to rent out property. Ibn al-Mundhir said: All the 
    scholars from whom we acquired knowledge are unanimously agreed that renting 
    out houses and animals is permissible. 
And it is only 
    permissible to rent them out for a specific, defined period, after viewing 
    and defining the property in question, because it cannot be known otherwise. 
    It is not permissible not to define the timescale or describe the property. 
    This is the view of al-Shaafa’i. 

    Al-Mughni, 5/260. 

    The correct view is that the rental period does not have to 
    be limited to a specific length of time, rather it can continue for months 
    or decades, so long as that is with the agreement of both parties. 

    Ibn Qudaamah said: 
If the rental is to last 
    for a period it should be known, such as a month or a year. There is no 
    dispute concerning that as far as we know. Because the timescale is 
    important with regard to the property to be rented, so it must be known, 
    just as when selling a commodity that can be measured, it should be sold by 
    measure. 

    Al-Mughni, 5/251. 

    And he said: 

    The maximum period of renting cannot be defined, rather the 
    property that is rented may continue to be rented so long as it is still 
    sound, even if the period is lengthy. This is the view of all the scholars… 
    because Allaah tells us that Shu’ayb (peace be upon him) said: 
“on condition that you 
    serve me for eight years; but if you complete ten years, it will be (a 
    favour) from you”

    [al-Qasas 28:27]
The law of the nations 
    before us is our law too, unless there is evidence that it has been 
    abrogated.  

    al-Mughni, 5/253 

    Secondly: 

    With regard to the death of either the tenant or the landlord 
    before the expiry of the rental period, the majority of scholars are of the 
    view that the contract is not annulled by the death of either party. The 
    Hanafis and some of the Taabi’een held a different view and said that the 
    contract is annulled, unless the heirs of the landlord agree to that, and 
    that they have the right to demand that the rental property be vacated. 

    The correct view is the view of the majority, so the contract 
    remains binding on both parties for the duration of the rental period. 

    In the book al-Ijaarah, al-Bukhaari is quoted as 
    having a chapter in his Saheeh entitled “Chapter: If a person rents 
    land and one of them dies. Ibn Seereen said: The family do not have the 
    right to make him leave until the period (of the rental agreement) is ended. 
    Al-Hakam, al-Hasan and Iyaas ibn Mu’aawiyah said: The rental continues until 
    the end of the period agreed upon. Ibn ‘Umar said: The Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) gave Khaybar to its people in return 
    for half of the harvest. That was at the time of the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) and Abu Bakr, and the beginning of Umar’s 
    caliphate, and there is no mention that Abu Bakr and ‘Umar renewed the 
    rental contract after the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) died. End quote. 

    Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said: 

    The words “Chapter: If a person rents land and one of them 
    dies” mean: is the rental annulled or not? The majority view is that it is 
    not annulled. The Kufis and al-Layth were of the view that it is annulled… 
    they agreed that the rental is not annulled if the person in charge of the 
    waqf dies, and this is the case here.  

    The words “The family do not have the right to…” refer to the 
    family of the deceased. 

    “to make him leave” means, to make the tenant leave. 

    The point here is to prove that the rental agreement is not 
    annulled if one of the two parties dies. This is the apparent meaning and is 
    referred to by the words “and there is no mention that Abu Bakr and ‘Umar 
    renewed the rental contract after the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) died”. 

    Fath al-Baari, 4/463. 

    Thirdly: 
With regard to what you 
    should do about the tenants who refuse to leave, we advise the following: 

    1 – You should explain to them that the contract between you 
    and them is not acceptable according to sharee’ah because it does not 
    mention the time period for the contract. We have stated above that the time 
    period must be stated, and there is no dispute among the scholars on this 
    point. 

    2 – You should give them sufficient opportunity to vacate the 
    property, and this period should be stated clearly to correct the previous 
    mistake and there should be a new contract with a set time period. 

    3 – If they refuse to leave, then you should tell them that 
    they are usurping the property and are sinning, and you should tell them of 
    the punishment for wrongdoing and the ruling on those who usurp property. 

    4 – You should bring in some influential wise men who could 
    speak to them, or some of their relatives or acquaintances whom they will 
    listen to. You can agree to pay them some money to leave the apartment. It 
    is haraam for them to consume this money, but as far as you are concerned, 
    if the person who is wronged cannot get his rights except by giving money to 
    the wrongdoer, it is permissible for him to do that. 

    See question no. 40272. 

    5 – If that does not work either, then you have three 
    choices: You can pray against them – for the prayer of the oppressed is 
    answered; or you can let them off; or you can leave their case to Allaah to 
    take your rights from them for you.

What is the remedy in either case?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    If a person looks at something he has with admiration and he 
    does not pray for barakah (blessing) for it, by saying “Baarik Allaahu fihi 
    (may Allaah bless it)” and the like, and this thing is then affected in some 
    way, then it is possible to know that he has inflicted hasad on himself.  

    It is not possible to know that a specific person is the one 
    who has envied you, except in circumstances such as those described above, 
    such as if a person enters your shop and starts to admire it but does not 
    pray for it to be blessed, then things in the shop get broken or damaged.

     This applies in cases where the effect is seen straightaway. 
    But if a long time passes before something happens, then we cannot be 
    certain that a specific person has envied him. 

    There are means that some people use to find out who has put 
    the evil eye on something or someone, but these are not prescribed or 
    approved of in sharee’ah, rather they are devilish means, such as imagining 
    (the person who caused it) during recitation of Qur’aan as a remedy, or 
    seeking the help of the jinn and devils (shayaateen) to find out such 
    things. 

    The scholars of the Standing Committee said: 

    With regard to imagining (the person who caused it) during 
    recitation of Qur’aan as a remedy, this is a devilish procedure which is not 
    permitted, because it is seeking the help of the devils (shayaateen), who 
    appear to the sick person in the form of the one who afflicted him. This is 
    something that is haraam, because it involves seeking the help of the 
    devils, and because it stirs up enmity between the people, and spreads fear 
    and mistrust among people, so it comes under the verse in which Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And verily, there were men among mankind who took shelter 
    with the males among the jinn, but they (jinn) increased them (mankind) in 
    sin and transgression”

    [al-Jinn 72:6]
They said: It is not 
    permissible to seek the help of the jinn in order to find out what has been 
    done and how it should be treated, because seeking the help of the jinn is 
    shirk. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And verily, there were men among mankind who took shelter 
    with the males among the jinn, but they (jinn) increased them (mankind) in 
    sin and transgression”

    [al-Jinn 72:6]

    And He says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And on the Day when He will gather them (all) together 
    (and say): ‘O you assembly of jinn! Many did you mislead of men,’ and their 
    Awliyaa’ (friends and helpers) amongst men will say: ‘Our Lord! We benefited 
    one from the other, but now we have reached our appointed term which You did 
    appoint for us.’ He will say: ‘The Fire be your dwelling place, you will 
    dwell therein forever, except as Allaah may will. Certainly your Lord is 
    All-Wise, All-Knowing’”
    [al-An’aam 6:128]
What is meant by 
    benefiting from one another is that the humans venerated the jinn and 
    humbled themselves to them and sought their help, so the jinn served them 
    and did what they wanted, and brought them what they asked for – including 
    telling them the nature and causes of sickness, things which the jinn can 
    see but humans cannot. But they may tell them lies because they cannot be 
    trusted and it is not permissible to believe them.

    Secondly: 

    With regard to treating one who has been affected by envy, 
    there are two ways of doing this: 

    If the person who envied him is known, he may be asked to do 
    ghusl and the water used should then be poured on the “victim”. If he is not 
    known then the remedy is by means of ruqyah and the dhikrs prescribed in 
    sharee’ah.

    “mut’ah”. It is known that there are two well-known forms of “ ‘urfi 
    marriage”, and he could be asking about three kinds, so we will answer on 
    the assumption that he is asking about all of them. 

    As for mut’ah marriage, which means marrying for a set time 
    limit agreed upon by both parties, for a specified mahr (dowry), after which 
    the marriage contract is annulled upon expiry of that time period – this is 
    a haraam marriage contract which is not valid at all. This has already been 
    discussed in the answers to questions no.
    1373,
    2377 and
    6595. 

    With regard to “ ‘urfi marriage” – there are two types of 
    this: 

    1 – Where the woman is married in secret, without the 
    agreement of her wali (guardian). If that is the case then it is a haraam 
    marriage contract which is not valid, because the agreement of the wali is 
    one of the conditions of the marriage contract being valid. 

    In the answer to question no.
    2127 you will find a summary of the 
    conditions of marriage, and the conditions of the wali. In the answer to 
    question no. 7989 there are more 
    details about the importance of the wali in order for the marriage to be 
    valid. 

    2 – Marriage with the agreement of the woman and her wali, 
    but without announcing the marriage publicly, or registering it in the 
    shar’i or civil courts, but there are witnesses. If this is the case, then 
    it is a valid marriage from the point of view of having met the necessary 
    conditions, but it goes against the Islamic command to publicize the 
    marriage. Not having the marriage officially documented may lead to the wife 
    losing out on her rights with regard to the dowry and inheritance, and if 
    the marriage leads to children, how will this child be recorded in official 
    documents? How will the woman defend her honour before people? 

    It should also be noted that some of the fuqaha’ say that 
    publicizing the marriage is one of the conditions of it being valid, which 
    is not far from the truth. They gave as the reason for that the fact that 
    publicizing the marriage demonstrates the difference between marriage and 
    immoral relationships. This is supported by the words of the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “The difference between what is 
    halaal and what is haraam is beating the daff and raising the voice at 
    weddings.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1088; al-Nasaa’i, 3369; Ibn Maajah, 
    1896. Classed as hasan by Shaykh al-Albaani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel, 
    1994 

    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: 
There is no doubt that a 
    marriage which is announced publicly is valid, even if it is not witnessed 
    by two witnesses, but if it is concealed and kept secret, this is a matter 
    concerning which there is some debate. If there are witnesses and it is also 
    announced publicly, this is the marriage concerning which there is no 
    dispute that it is valid. If there are no witnesses and it is not announced 
    publicly, then it is invalid according to all scholars. But if there are any 
    scholars who dispute this, they are very few.

    Al-Fataawa al-Kubra, 
    3/191 

    Ibn al-Qayyim said: 
The Lawgiver has 
    stipulated four conditions for marriage in addition to the marriage 
    contract, in order for there to be no suspicion of immoral conduct: it 
    should be publicized, there should be a wali (woman’s guardian), the woman 
    should not do the marriage contract herself and it is mustahabb to beat the 
    daff and raise voices (in song) and give a waleemah (wedding feast), because 
    that does away with the means that may lead to immoral actions under the 
    guise of being married. 

    I’laam al-Muwaqqi’een, 3/113 

    i.e., if marriage is done in secret, it is possible that if 
    the woman gets pregnant and gives birth, the man may deny this child because there is no proof that this woman is his wife and this child is his child. But if there are witnesses and the marriage is publicized, there is no room for this evil action to take place.",Islam Q&A
45666,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45666,Wudu is not invalidated by bleeding from the body,Is Wudu invalidated by bleeding from the body?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.If impure substances come out of the body, one of the following three scenarios must apply: 
-1- 
It is urine or stools and comes out from the usual exit. This invalidates Wudu, according to evidence from the Quran and Sunnah, and scholarly consensus. 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“But if you are ill or on a journey, or any of you comes after answering the call of nature, or you have been in contact with women (i.e. sexual intercourse), and you find no water, then perform Tayammum with clean earth and rub therewith your faces and hands” [Al-Maa’idah 5:6]
Al-Tirmidhi (96) narrated that Safwaan ibn ‘Assaal (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to command us, if we were travelling, not to take off our khufoof (leather slippers, socks and the like) for three days and three nights except in the case of janaabah, but not stools, urine or sleep. Classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
Stools, urine or sleep are things that invalidate Wudu.  
-2- 
If urine or stools come out from a place other than the usual exit, such as one who has had surgery and they now come out from an opening in his stomach, for example. This invalidates Wudu because the evidence quoted above indicates that Wudu is invalidated when urine and stools come out, and the general meaning indicates that this applies whether they come out of the usual exit or elsewhere. 
-3- 
The impurity that is coming out of the body is not urine or stools, such as blood and vomit, according to those scholars who say that vomit is impure. 
This is a matter concerning which the scholars differed. Some of them – such as Imam Abu Haneefah and Ahmad – were of the view that they do invalidate Wudu, although they differed concerning the details.  
They quoted a number of texts as evidence for that: 
1 – The words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to the woman who was suffering from istihaadah (non-menstrual vaginal bleeding): “That is from a vein, so do Wudu for every prayer.” They said: The reason why Wudu is required may be that it is bleeding from a vein, and this applies to every kind of bleeding. 
2 – The report narrated by al-Tirmidhi (87) from Ma’daan ibn Abi Talhah from Abu’l-Darda’ (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) vomited and broke his fast, then he did Wudu. I met Thawbaan in the mosque of Damascus and mentioned that to him. He said: That is right; I poured the water for his Wudu. Classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
Many scholars are of the view that the emission of impurities from the body does not invalidate Wudu, and they quoted as evidence the fact that the basic principle is that Wudu is not invalidated, and there is no saheeh evidence to indicate that Wudu is invalidated by that. 
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
My inclination concerning this matter is to say that the basic principle is that Wudu is not invalidated unless there is proof in sharee’ah, and there is no proof in this case. End quote. 
They responded to the evidence quoted by those who say that it does invalidate Wudu by noting the following: 
With regard to the hadith about the woman who was suffering from istihaadah, they responded that what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) meant by that was to point out that it was not menstrual blood, rather it was bleeding from a vein, and as that was the case, she should not stop praying, rather she should pray, but she should do wudoo for every prayer. 
Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmoo’: If it – the hadith about the woman who was suffering from istihaadah – is saheeh, what it means is that this bleeding is not menstrual blood, rather it requires Wudu because it comes out from the same area as urine comes out. It does not mean that the emission of blood, from any site, requires Wudu. End quote. 
With regard to the hadith of Thawbaan, they noted several points in response to it: 
1 – That it is da’eef (weak). Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmoo’: As for the response to their quoting the hadith of Abu Darda’ as evidence, the response to that can be made in several ways, the best of which is that it is da’eef mudtarab (weak). This was stated by al-Bayhaqi and other scholars. End quote.
2 – Even if it is saheeh, it does not indicate that Wudu is invalidated by vomiting, because it is simply a report of something that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did. It indicates that it is mustahabb to do Wudu after vomiting, not that it is obligatory. 
See: al-Majmoo’ 2/63-65; al-Mughni, 1/233, 234 and 1/247-250; al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 1/185-189

My question is: Is what I did permissible? Especially since it went on for nearly a year, because the customs of marriage in our society do not allow one partner to get to know the character of the other until they get engaged, but after that if it becomes clear that the two are not compatible and they cancel the engagement, that will lead to problems and severing of family ties. I feel worried about what I did and I am afraid that it may be considered a sin or an act of treachery. It is permissible to continue our correspondence until I come and propose marriage to her?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to correspond or converse with a non-mahram woman. If a man intends to propose marriage then he should follow the Islamically-prescribed means of doing so. If the woman whom he wants to marry is one of his relatives, then it should be more straightforward because either he will knows about her or he will be able to find out about her from the women of his own family. 
It is not possible for a man or a woman to find out about the real character of one another through correspondence and conversing before marriage, because neither of them will show anything but their best side. 
Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Jibreen was asked: 
If a man corresponds with a woman and they fall in love, is this regarded as a haraam action? 
He replied: 
This action is not permitted, because it provokes desire between them and makes them hope to meet and get in touch. This often leads to temptation and sows the seeds of zina in the heart, which leads to immoral actions or the things that lead to them. We advise all those who want to protect themselves to avoid corresponding and the like, so as to protect their religious commitment and their honour. And Allaah is the Source of strength. 
Fataawa al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah, 2/578, 579 
We have already stated that correspondence between the two sexes is haraam, in the answers to questions no. 26890 and 10221. 
It is permissible for the man who has proposed marriage to look at his fiancée, without being alone with her or shaking hands with her.

1 – If he dies as the result of bleeding in his stomach, in which case he would be called al-mabtoon (one who is stricken with a disease or injury in the stomach), whether he was in a car or walking or standing, and he was struck by a car. This is according to the view of some scholars, who say that the mabtoon is the one who dies because of any trouble in the stomach, no matter what it is. 
It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The martyrs are five: the one who dies of the plague; the one who dies of stomach trouble (al-mabtoon); the one who drowns; the one who is crushed by a falling wall; and the martyr who dies for the sake of Allah.” 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2674; Muslim, 1914. 
In an addition narrated by al-Tirmidhi (1846), Abu Dawood (311) and Ibn Maajah (2803) it says: “… and the one who dies of pleurisy, and the woman who dies together (with her baby).” 
Al-Nawawi said: … According to another report: “The plague is martyrdom for every Muslim.” 
Al-mabtoon is the one who suffers from a stomach complaint, namely diarrhoea. Al-Qaadi said: It was said that it is dropsy and swelling of the stomach. And it was said that it refers to the one who suffers from a stomach complaint. And it was said that it refers to the one who dies of a stomach complaint of any kind. 
The one who drowns is the one who dies from drowning in water; the one who is crushed by a falling wall means the one who dies beneath it; the one who dies of pleurisy is the one who suffers from inflammation in his side, internally. Burning refers to the one who dies in a fire. The women who dies together (with her baby) refers to a woman who dies during pregnancy along with her child, or it was said: one who dies a virgin. The former is the correct view. 
Sharh Muslim, 13/63. 
2 – If the person dies as the result of a crash, whether he died inside the car or outside. This may be likened to the one who is crushed by a falling wall, mentioned in the hadeeth quoted above.   
The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked: 
Some people say that a person who dies as the result of a car accident is a martyr and he will have a reward like that of the martyrs. Is this correct or not?

We hope that he will be a martyr, because this is like the Muslim who dies under a falling wall. It was narrated in a saheeh report from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that such a person is a martyr. Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 8/375.

My father has a store in which he sells cards for public telephones. Every time I needed a card I used to tell my father or my mother that I was going to take a card from the store and they would let me do that. But there came a time when I needed a card nearly every day. And I would take a card with the knowledge of the clerk who was working in the store, but I did not tell my father or mother, because I felt that they would never agree to that. When I realized how wrong this was, I never took anything without their knowledge after that. I regretted what I had done and repented to Allaah. Is repentance enough or do I have to tell them what I was doing? Or can I at least take part of my own money and give it to them without them knowing that it was me who gave them this money, because I cannot tell them openly? Can I give them the money until I have paid off what I took, knowing that I do not know the true amount I took because I took so many cards?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    We hope that when you used a lot of these cards it was for 
    good and permissible purposes, because if it was used for the opposite then 
    your using them will be compounded by other sins too, so you should pay 
    attention to this fact. 

    As you have acknowledged that you were wrong to take these

    up the forbidden action, resolving not to go back to it, and restoring 
    people’s rightful property or seeking their forgiveness. You do not have to 
    tell your father what you did, rather what you have to do is to return the 
    money in whatever way you can. You should try hard to figure out the value 
    of the cards you took without your father’s permission, and give this money

45671,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45671,Is it haraam to cut down lote trees?,"Is it haraam to cut down lote trees? I am the one who planted it, but now I do not want it in that place. Is it permissible for me to cut it down?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The prohibition on cutting down lote trees has been narrated in several ahaadeeth concerning whose isnaads there was some debate among the scholars. Some of the scholars classed them as saheeh. The correct view concerning this prohibition – after establishing that the reports are sound – is that it applies only to two things: cutting down trees that provide shade, and cutting down lote trees within the limits of the Haram (the Sanctuary of Makkah). With regard to any other trees that a person may have planted in his home or garden, there is no sin in cutting them down. 
Ibn al-Qayyim said, under the heading of Kulliyyaat fi’l-Mawdoo’aat: 
“An example of that is the ahaadeeth which praise celibacy, all of which are false, and the ahaadeeth which forbid cutting down lote trees. Al-‘Aqeeli said: There are no saheeh reports about cutting down lote trees. And Ahmad said: There is no saheeh hadeeth concerning that.” 
Al-Manaar al-Muneef, p. 117, 118 
But Shaykh al-Albaani classed some of these ahaadeeth as hasan, such as the following: 
1 – It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Those who cut down lote trees will be thrown headfirst into Hellfire.” 
Narrated by al-Bayhaqi, 6/140; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 1696. 
2 – It was narrated from Mu’aawiyah ibn Jaydah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The one who cuts down a lote tree, Allaah will throw him headfirst into Hellfire.”  
Narrated by al-Bayhaqi, 6/141; classed as hasan by Shaykh al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 615. 
He said – following the hadeeth quoted above: 
Abu Dawood interpreted it by saying: this hadeeth is concise, and is what it means is that whoever cuts down a lote tree in the open desert that wayfarers and animals use for shade, merely for sport and to wrong others unlawfully, then Allaah will throw him headfirst into Hellfire. 
Al-Tahhaawi was of the view that this is abrogated, and he quoted as evidence the fact that it was narrated that ‘Urwah ibn al-Zubayr – one of the narrators of this hadeeth – cut down a lote tree. 
I say: the most likely interpretation in my view is that this applies only to cutting down the lote trees in the Haram, as is explained by the comment added by al-Tabaraani to the hadeeth of ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Habashi: “i.e., the lote trees of the Haram.” This dispels any confusion; praise be to Allaah. 
Then I learned that al-Suyooti had reached this conclusion before me, in his essay Raf’ al-Hadhr fi Qat’ al-Sidr (Dispelling confusion concerning the prohibition on cutting down of lote trees) (al-Haawi li’l-Fataawi, vol. 2, p. 212). Those who wish to learn more may refer to this essay, in which other isnaads of the hadeeth are mentioned. 
In conclusion:  the ahaadeeth which forbid the cutting down of lote trees are either da’eef (weak) hadeeths which are not valid, or they are hasan and may be interpreted as referring to two things: 
1 – cutting down lote trees that people use for shade, for sport and for no useful purpose. 
2 – Cutting down the lote trees in the Haram. 
Based on this, there is no sin on you if you cut down this tree that you had planted, so long as you did not plant it by the road for people to use for shade.

45672,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45672,Should she wear hijab even though her family will be harmed because of that?,What is the ruling on a woman who wears hijab in an Arab country which forbids hijab by force and by harming the woman’s religious commitment and social interests? Should she remain steadfast even though some of her family members may be harmed indirectly? Please advise me.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    It is a serious crime and a reprehensible action to prevent a 
    Muslim woman from wearing hijab as enjoined by Allaah and forcing her by law 
    to uncover her head and face and go out unveiled among people. 

    The Muslim has to adhere to the rulings of sharee’ah and 
    “there is no obedience to any created being if it involves disobedience 
    towards the Creator.” The Muslim woman’s hijab is one of the duties that she 
    is obliged to fulfil. The harm that a woman imagines will befall her or her 
    family may be baseless, or it may not be extreme, and it may be something 
    that can be put up with. So she has to continue to adhere to correct Islamic 
    dress. 

    If the harm is extreme and certain, or it is most likely that 
    it will happen, then the woman can take off her hijab in order to protect 
    her honour and religious commitment, but she has to remain as covered and as 
    modest as she possibly can. In this case it is not permissible for her to go 
    out of the house except when absolutely necessary, and there is no 
    concession allowing her to go out to study or to buy things that someone 
    else can bring to her. What we mean is that she should only go out for 
    essential needs that cannot easily be dealt with at home, or for some shar’i 
    action that she cannot forsake, and so on. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was 
    asked: 

    In some countries Muslim women may be forced to take off 
    their hijab and leave their heads uncovered. Is it permissible for them to 
    do that, knowing that whoever refuses to do that is faced with consequences 
    such as losing their jobs or being expelled from school? 

    The Shaykh replied: 

    This calamity which is happening in some countries is one of 
    the things by means of which a person may be tested. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Alif-Laam-Meem.

    [These letters are one of the miracles of the Qur’aan, and 
    none but Allaah (Alone) knows their meanings.]

    2. Do people think that they will be left alone because 
    they say: “We believe,” and will not be tested.

    3. And We indeed tested those who were before them. And 
    Allaah will certainly make (it) known (the truth of) those who are true, and 
    will certainly make (it) known (the falsehood of) those who are liars, 
    (although Allaah knows all that before putting them to test)”

    [al-‘Ankaboot 29:1-3]
What I think is that 
    Muslim women in these countries should refuse to obey people in charge (the 
    rulers) in this evil action, because obeying those in authority in doing 
    something that is wrong is not allowed. Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “O you who believe! Obey Allaah and obey the Messenger 
    (Muhammad), and those of you (Muslims) who are in authority”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:59]

    If you think about the meaning of this verse, you will note 
    that Allaah says “Obey Allaah and obey the Messenger (Muhammad), and 
    those of you (Muslims) who are in authority” – but the verb (obey) is 
    not repeated in the third case with regard to those who are in authority. 
    This indicates that obedience to those in authority is secondary to 
    obedience to Allaah and obedience to His Messenger. If their command is 
    contrary to obeying Allaah and His Messenger, then they should not be 
    listened to or obeyed in that which goes against obedience to Allaah and His 
    Messenger. “There is no obedience to any created being if it involves 
    disobedience to the Creator.” 
The persecution that a 
    woman may face in this regard is something that has to be borne with 
    patience, and she should seek the help of Allaah in being patient. We ask 
    Allaah to guide those in authority to the truth. I do not think that this 
    forcing her not to wear hijab can take place unless the woman leaves her 
    home, but if she stays at home no one can force her, so she can stay in her 
    house so that she will be safe from this thing. With regard to studies that 
    will lead to her committing sin, this is not permissible, rather she should 
    study whatever she needs for her religious and worldly interests. This is 
    sufficient, and this can usually be done at home.

And there is nothing wrong with helping her to do that, on condition that this does not involve imitating the kaafir women or immoral women. What is meant by imitating them is styling the hair in manners that are known to be unique to the kaafir woman, or is known to be a style of a certain kaafir or immoral woman. That is because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 4031; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’ al-Sagheer.

I would like to take this opportunity to advise the Muslim woman and those who are in charge of them to avoid these (fashion) magazines and these styles which encourage imitation of the ways of the kuffaar and liking the indecent clothes that they wear, that have nothing whatsoever to do with the modesty of Islam, and these fashions regarding hair styles. The Muslims should be distinct from others as dictated by Islamic sharee’ah and the Islamic attitude, so that the Muslim ummah may regain its pride and honour.

With regard to wearing the hair up, or making it into a bun on top of the head, or parting it at the side, some scholars disallow this, lest it be an imitation of the kaafir women. Some of them included the bun in the condemnation narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “There are two types of the people of Hell whom I have not yet seen: people with whips like the tails of cattle with which they strike the people, and women who are clothed yet naked, astray and leading others astray, with their heads like the humps of camels, leaning to one side. They will not enter Paradise nor even smell its fragrance, although it fragrance may be detected from such and such a distance.”  Narrated by Muslim, 2128. 
If we look at the parting of the hair on one side, for example, this may have been a fashion that was unique to kaafir and immoral women at one time, then it stopped being unique to them and spread to the Muslim women, and no one would think that the one who does it is a kaafir or an immoral woman. In that case the ruling on imitating the kuffaar no longer applies, so it is not haraam. 
Al-Haafiz said in al-Fath (1/307), when discussing the mayaasir al-arjawaan, which is a kind of small cushion which a horse-rider places beneath him, which was something that the Persians used to do: If we say that this is forbidden because it is an imitation of the Persians, then the prohibition is for a religious reason, but that was one of their unique features at that time, when they were kaafirs, but because it is no longer one of their unique features, the reason for disallowing it no longer applies, so it is no longer makrooh. And Allaah knows best. 
He also said, refuting those who regarded wearing the taylasaan (pallium, a large rectangular cloak as worn by the ancient Greeks) as a kind of imitation of the kuffaar, because it is the clothing of the Jews as mentioned in the hadeeth about the Dajjaal: It is appropriate to quote the hadeeth about the Jews at the time when the taylasaan is one of their unique features, but this does not apply at the present time, so now it is included among that which is permissible. 
Fath al-Baari, 10/274. 
We have also quoted other material form him which supports this view, in the answer given above. And Allaah knows best. 
This is the fatwa of the scholars with regard to women wearing the hair in a bun and parting the hair on the side. 
It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (17/126): 
What is the ruling on a woman parting the hair on the side, and making only one braid, and making it into a bun, with the intention of making herself beautiful for her husband or to look good because it suits her? 
With regard to parting the hair on the side, this involves imitating the kaafir women, and it is proven that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said it is haraam to imitate the kuffaar. 
With regard to gathering the hair into and letting it hang down the back, either braided or not braided, there is nothing wrong with that so long as it is covered (hijab). But making it into a bun (on top of the head) is not permitted, because that is an imitation of kaafir women and it is haraam to imitate them. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) warned against that when he said: “There are two types of the people of Hell whom I have not yet seen: people with whips like the tails of cattle with which they strike the people, and women who are clothed yet naked, astray and leading others astray, with their heads like the humps of camels, leaning to one side. They will not enter Paradise nor even smell its fragrance, although it fragrance may be detected from such and such a distance.”  Narrated by Ahmad and Muslim. 
Shaykh Fawzaan was asked: What is the ruling on parting the hair on the side and not in the middle? He replied: It is not permissible for a woman to part her hair on the side. Shaykh Muhammad Ibraaheem (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “With regard to what some Muslim women do nowadays, parting the hair on the side and gathering it on top of the head, or doing the parting like European women, this is not permissible, because it involves imitating the kaafir women. From Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem, 1/47. 
Al-Muntaqa, 3/321 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the ruling on a woman gathering her hair on top of her head? 
If the hair is gathered on top of the head, this is regarded by the scholars as being included in the prohibition or warning that was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in his hadeeth: “There are two types of the people of Hell whom I have not yet seen: …  and women who are clothed yet naked, astray and leading others astray, with their heads like the humps of camels, leaning to one side.” So if the hair is on top of the head, it is not allowed. But if it is at the nape of the neck, for example, then there is nothing wrong with it, unless the woman is going out to the marketplace, in which case this is a kind of tabarruj because it can be noticed through the abayah, so this comes under the heading of tabarruj and is a means of fitnah, so it is not allowed.

45676,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45676,What is Kaffarat al-Yamin?,Please explain kaffarat al-yamin (the expiation for breaking a vow) in detail.,"Kaffarat al-yamin is: 1-feeding ten poor persons with the average kind of food that he feeds his family, 2- Clothing ten poor people, 3- Freeing a believing slave. Whoever cannot do any of the above should fast for three consecutive days.","Kaffarat al-Yamin


Can you pay Kaffarat al-Yamin in cash?","Praise be to Allah.Kaffarat al-Yamin
Kaffarat al-yamin is mentioned by Allah in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allah will not punish you for what is unintentional in your oaths, but He will punish you for your deliberate oaths; for its expiation (a deliberate oath) feed ten Masakin (poor persons), on a scale of the average of that with which you feed your own families, or clothe them or manumit a slave. But whosoever cannot afford (that), then he should fast for three days. That is the expiation for the oaths when you have sworn. And protect your oaths (i.e. do not swear much). Thus Allah makes clear to you His Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) that you may be grateful.” [Al-Maidah 5:89] 
So the person has the choice of three things when offering the expiation for breaking an oath :  

Feeding ten poor persons with the average kind of food that he feeds his family, by giving each person half a sa’ of the usual local staple, such as rice etc. This is equivalent to approximately one-and-a-half kilograms. If rice is usually eaten with some kind of sauce then along with the rice he should give them some sauce or meat. If he gathers together ten poor people and offers them lunch or dinner, this is sufficient. 
Clothing ten poor people, which means giving each one clothing that is suitable for praying in, so for a man he would give a thobe or dishdasha or a lower garment and upper garment (izar and rida), and for a woman a concealing dress and a head cover. 
Freeing a believing slave. 

Whoever cannot do any of the above should fast for three consecutive days. 
Can you pay Kaffarat al-Yamin in cash?
The majority of scholars are of the view that it is not sufficient to pay the kaffarah in cash . 
Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“It is not sufficient to offer the value of the food or clothing to be given in expiation , because Allah mentions food, so expiation cannot be offered by any other means, and because Allah has given us a choice between three things, and if it were permissible to pay the value, the choice would not be limited to these three things…” (Al-Mughni by Ibn Qudamah, 11/256) 
Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“But the kaffarah should be offered in the form of food , not cash, because this is what it says in the Quran and Sunnah. What must be offered is half a sa’ of the local staple food, whether it be dates, wheat or something else. That is equivalent to approximately one-and-a-half kilograms. If you give them lunch or dinner, or give them clothes which are suitable for praying in – namely a thobe or a lower and upper garment (izar and rida) – that is sufficient.” (Fatawa Islamiyyah, 3/481) 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said: 
“If a person cannot find a slave to free, or clothes or food to give , then he must fast three consecutive days with no break in between.” “Manar al-Islam, 3/667”

45684,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45684,The farewell tawaaf is obligatory for the people of Jeddah,"We are from Jeddah and after Hajj, some of those who were with us said that the people of Jeddah do not have to do the farewell tawaaf. What should we do?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 
The farewell tawaaf is 
    obligatory for the one who wants to leave Makkah after completing the 
    rituals of Hajj, because al-Bukhaari (1755) and Muslim (1328) narrated that 
    Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The people were commanded 
    that the last thing they should do should be to circumambulate the House, 
    but this was waived in the case of menstruating women. 

    Al-Haafiz said in al-Fath: 

    This indicates that the farewell tawaaf is obligatory, 
    because the command is confirmed and because it is waived in the case of 
    menstruating women; and a thing can only be waived if it is first 
    confirmed.  End quote. Al-Nawawi said something similar in Sharh Muslim. 
The scholars differed 
    concerning those for whom the farewell tawaaf is obligatory. Some of them 
    said that it is obligatory for the one who is going to travel and pass the 
    meeqaat, but for those who live within the meeqaat, the farewell tawaaf is 
    not obligatory. 

    See Radd al-Muhtaar, 3/545 
Others were of the view 
    that it is obligatory for anyone who is going to travel the distance at 
    which is becomes permissible to shorten the prayers (approximately 80 
    kilometers), but for those who are travelling a shorter distance, it is not 
    obligatory. Al-Shaafa’i and Ahmad were of the view that it is obligatory for 
    everyone who is going to travel from Makkah and exit the city. 

    Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmoo’ (8/236): 
We narrated from 
    al-Baghawi that the farewell tawaaf is required of everyone who wants to 
    leave Makkah and travel the distance at which is becomes permissible to 
    shorten the prayers. He said: if a person wants to travel for less than that 
    distance, he does not have to do the farewell tawaaf. But the correct and 
    well known view is that it is required of the one who wants to travel the 
    distance at which is becomes permissible to shorten the prayers or less, 
    whether that is a short or long distance, because of the general meaning of 
    the hadeeth. End quote. 

    Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni (5/337): 
If a person’s home is in 
    the Haram, then he is like a Makkan and does not have to do the farewell 
    tawaaf. If a person’s home is outside the Haram, but close to it, then the 
    apparent meaning of al-Khuraqi’s words is that he should not depart until he 
    has bid farewell to the House. This is the view of Abu Thawr and is similar 
    to what Maalik said, and is based on the general meaning of the words of the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “No one should 
    leave until the last thing he has done is to circumambulate the House.” And 
    because he is leaving Makkah, he must bid farewell, like one who lives far 
    away. End quote. 

    The view that the people of Jeddah do not have to do the 
    farewell tawaaf was stated by some scholars, but the correct view is that it 
    is obligatory for them. Based on that, those who did not do it have to offer 
    a sacrifice (a sheep or one-seventh of a cow) to be slaughtered in Makkah 
    and its meat distributed among the poor of the Haram. The same applies to 
    everyone who omitted one of the obligatory parts of the Hajj rituals. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: 

    Whoever lives in Jeddah must not leave Makkah until he has 
    bid farewell. End quote. 

    Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 
    23/353 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may 
    Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about some people from Jeddah who did 
    not do the farewell tawaaf and went back to Jeddah. 

    He replied: 
Their Hajj is valid, but 
    they have done wrong by omitting to bid farewell, because the Messenger  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded the pilgrim to bid 
    farewell, and said:  “No one should leave until the last thing he has done 
    is to circumambulate the House.”  This command, which is addressed to the 
    pilgrims, includes the people of Jeddah and others. So all the people from 
    other cities – whether they come from Jeddah or al-Taa’if or anywhere else – 
    should bid farewell to the House. Some scholars granted a dispensation to 
    those whose homes are closer than the distance at which is becomes 
    permissible to shorten the prayers, such as the people of Bahrah etc, and 
    said that they do not have to bid farewell, but in order to be on the safe 
    side, everyone who comes from outside the sanctuary should bid farewell when 
    his Hajj is over. The people of Jeddah live far away, as do the people of 
    al-Taa’if, so they should bid farewell before they leave, because the 
    hadeeth applies to them too. They should offer a sacrifice to be slaughtered 
    in Makkah for each of them who did not do the farewell tawaaf, the meat of 
    which should be distributed to the poor, a sheep or one-seventh of a camel 
    or one-seventh of a cow. End quote. 

    Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn Baaz, 
    17/394 

    It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 11/303: 
If you do Hajj then you should not travel to Jeddah after your Hajj until you have done the farewell tawaaf; if you travel before bidding farewell, then you have to offer a sacrifice to be slaughtered in Makkah, from which you should not eat, rather it should be distributed to the poor, because the farewell tawaaf is obligatory after Hajj, because of the general meaning of the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him), who commanded the people that the last thing they should do should be to circumambulate the House, but this was waived in the case of menstruating women. Saheeh – agreed upon. And you also have to repent to Allaah for going out to Jeddah before doing the farewell tawaaf. End quote.

    Usually when a person gives such a small amount of money he 
    gives it as a gift, not as a loan, which is why he did not come to take it 
    back. Perhaps he told you that he would come to take it back so that you 
    would not feel embarrassed, and so that you would take this money from him 
    and not refuse. You should respond to his kindness in like manner, and 
    reciprocate either by giving him a gift or making du’aa’ for him, etc. You 
    could also – so as to overcome the feelings of shyness  – go to him and 
    greet him with salaam and ask him how he is, and tell him that you have not 
    forgotten what he did for you in the past, and thank him for it; you can 
    tell him that you still owe him this money and that the only thing that kept 
    you from returning it was embarrassment. If he lets you off, then praise be 
    to Allaah, otherwise you can repay him. This is a kind of calling people to 
    Allaah, which lets you address the importance of people’s rights and paying

45691,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45691,Does paying more than the amount required for zakaah mean that one is allowed to take interest?,"There seems to be some difference of opinion about interest and whether it is halaal or haraam. 

If I pay more than the amount required for zakaah in Ramadaan or more than the amount of interest, will it become permissible for me to take and dispose of this interest and will it become pure?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Interest from the bank is haraam according to the consensus 
    of reliable scholars. Many statements have been issued to that effect by 
    many respectable academic bodies in the Muslim world, such as the statement 
    issued by the Islamic Research Council of al-Azhar in 1965 CE, which 
    included representatives and delegates from thirty-five Muslim states. In 
    this statement it says:  

    “Interest on all kinds of loans is forbidden riba, regardless 
    of the type of loan, because the texts of the Qur’aan and Sunnah, when taken 
    together, definitively forbid all types.” 

    A statement was also issued by the Islamic Fiqh Council 
    belonging to the Organization of the Islamic Conference, in 1985 CE, in 
    which it says: 

    “Interest on loans in return for deferral of repayment when 
    the borrower is unable to pay them when they are due, and interest on loans 
    from the outset, are both forms of forbidden riba.” 

    A similar statement was also issued by the Islamic Fiqh 
    Council belonging to the Muslim World League in 1986 CE, in which it said: 

    “All wealth that comes by means of riba-based loans is wealth 
    that is haraam according to sharee’ah. It is not permissible for the Muslim 
    to make use of it, whether he deposited the money for himself or for anyone 
    of his dependents, for any of their affairs. He has to dispose of it by 
    giving it to charitable projects that will benefit the Muslims, such as 
    schools, hospitals, etc. This does not come under the heading of charity, 
    rather it comes under the heading of cleansing wealth of haraam elements.” 

    It is not permissible under any circumstances to leave this 
    interest in the riba-based bank to increase. This sin is greater with regard 
    to banks abroad, because they usually support Christian and Jewish 
    interests, thus they use the wealth of the Muslims to further aggression 
    against the Muslims and mislead them from their religion. It should also be 
    noted that it is not permissible to continue to deal with these riba-based 
    banks, whether one deals directly in interest or not.

    Hence we may understand that the confusion that some people 
    try to stir up as to whether interest is haraam or not is something to which 
    no attention should be paid. 

    Interest is impure wealth from which zakaah and charity 
    cannot be given, whether that is zakaat al-fitr in Ramadaan or other kinds 
    of charity. What you have to do is to get rid of this money by donating it 
    to Muslim charitable causes, and also stop dealing with riba based banks as 
    much as you can.

45694,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45694,What did the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) mean by “No contagion (‘adwa)”?,What is the original text of the hadeeth “There is no ‘adwa in religion” and what is meant by that?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.There are several versions of this hadeeth. Al-Bukhaari (5776) and Muslim (2224) narrated from Anas ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no ‘adwa (transmission of infectious disease without the permission of Allaah) and no tiyarah (superstitious belief in bird omens), but I like good omens.” They said: What is a good omen?” He said: “A good word.” 
Al-Bukhaari (5316) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no ‘adwaa [contagion, transmission of infectious disease without the permission of Allaah], no tiyarah [superstitious belief in bird omens], no haamah [refers to a Jaahili Arab tradition described variously as: a worm which infests the grave of a murder victim until he is avenged; an owl; or the bones of a dead person turned into a bird that could fly], and no Safar [the month of Safar was regarded as “unlucky” during the Jaahiliyyah].” 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:  
The words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) “There is no ‘adwa” are general in meaning, thus the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) states that there is no contagion (without the permission of Allaah). 
‘Adwa (contagion) refers to the spread of a disease from a sick person to a healthy one. What happens in the case of physical diseases may also happen in the case of psychological diseases. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said that a bad companion is the like one who operates the bellows: Either he will burn your clothes, or you will notice a bad smell from him. 
The words “there is no ‘adwa” include both physical and psychological diseases, even though it is more apparent with regard to physical disease. 
The words “no tiyarah (lit. superstitious belief in bird omens)” refers to feeling superstitious because of something that you see, hear or know.. 
With regard to the words “no haamah”, haamah is interpreted in two ways: 
1 – That it is a bird similar to an owl, or an owl. The Arabs believed that if a person was killed, his bones became a haamah that could fly and shriek until he was avenged. Some of them believed that the haamah was the soul of the slain person. 
2 – Some of the Arabs said that the haamah was a particular bird, which they regarded as a bad omen. If it landed on the house of one of them and made a sound, they said that it was predicting a death. They believed that this was a sign that that person would die soon. All of these are undoubtedly false beliefs. 
The words “No Safar” refers to the month of Safar, which the Arabs used to regard as inauspicious, especially for marriage. 
And it was said that it was a stomach disease that affected camels and was transmitted from one camel to another; based on this, mentioning it after ‘adwa (contagion) comes under the heading of mentioning something specific after something general. 
It is more likely that what is meant by Safar here is the month, and that what is meant by saying “No Safar” is that it is not to be regarded as inauspicious, rather it is like any other time, during which good or bad things may be decreed. 
This does not mean that these things do not happen, because they do happen. Rather it is a statement that they do not have any effect. The One Who causes things to happen is Allaah. If any of these things has a known effect then that is valid and real; if any of them is imagined to have an effect, then that is invalid and false. Thus the hadeeth demonstrates that if there is a valid effect, it cannot be attributed to that thing itself (rather the One Who causes it to happen is Allaah). If the effect is merely imagined, then this hadeeth is stating that it has no effect in the first place. 
With regard to the words “no contagion (‘adwa)”: contagion is something that happens, as is indicated by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “Do not put a sick one with a healthy one” i.e., the owner of a sick camel should not bring it to the owner of a healthy camel, lest the contagion be transmitted. 
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Flee from the leper as you would flee from a lion.” Leprosy is a serious disease that is transmitted quickly and kills the one who catches it. It was even said that it is a plague. Hence the command to flee from the leper so that the disease will not be transmitted from him to you. This is an affirmation of the effect of contagion, but its effect is not inevitable in such a way that it affects people by itself. The command of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to flee and not to bring sick camels to where healthy camels are comes under the heading of avoiding the means (that lead to sickness), not attributing the effect to the means themselves. The means do not affect anything themselves, but we should avoid the things that may be a cause of calamity, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and do not throw yourselves into destruction”
[al-Baqarah 2:195]
We cannot say that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was denying the effect of contagion, because contagion is something that is proven to exist in real life and is mentioned in other ahaadeeth. 
When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said “there is no ‘adwa”, a man said: “O Messenger of Allaah, the camels may be healthy like deer, then a mangy camel comes and mixes with them and they all get the mange.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “And who infected the first one?” meaning that the disease came to the first one with no contagion, rather it came from Allaah. By the same token, if it was transmitted by contagion, then it was transmitted by the command of Allaah. A thing may have a known cause or it may not have a known cause. The mange of the first one does not have a known cause, apart from the fact that it happened by the will and decree of Allaah, and the mange that came after it does have a known cause. But if Allaah wills the camel will not become mangy. Hence sometimes a camel may get the mange but then it recovers and does not die. The same happens with the plague and cholera; they may enter a house and some may get sick and die, while others are not affected at all.
 We have to put our trust in Allaah and depend on Him. It was narrated that a leper came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and he took him by the hand and said, “Eat,” i.e., eat of the food that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was eating– because of the strength of his trust in Allaah. This trust counteracts the causes of contagion. 
What we have referred to above is the best way of reconciling between the ahaadeeth. 
End quote from Sharh Kitaab al-Tawheed, 2/80 
Based on this, what is meant by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) “no ‘adwa (contagion)” is that disease is not transmitted from a sick person to a healthy one by itself, rather it is transmitted by the will and decree of Allaah. If a sick person mixes with healthy ones this is one of the causes of the transmission of disease. But this does not mean that it will inevitably happen, rather it only happens if Allaah wills it. Hence we often see a sick mother give birth to a healthy child, but the disease is not transmitted to the infant.

With regard to the suggestion that she was his mahram through radaa’ah (breastfeeding), this was refuted by al-Dimyaati on the grounds that it cannot be proven.

Commenting on the hadeeth of al-Rubayyi’ bint Mu’awwidh ibn ‘Afra, who said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came and entered when it was my wedding and sat by my bed like you are sitting next to me now, and some young girls of ours started to beat the daff and eulogize about those of my forefathers who were killed on the day of Badr. When one of them said, “There is among us a Prophet who knows what will happen tomorrow,” he said, “Do not say this, but say the other things you were saying” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4750), 
Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said: What is clear to us on the basis of strong evidence is that one of the unique characteristics of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is that it was permissible for him to be alone with a non-mahram woman and to look at her. This is the correct answer concerning the story of Umm Haraam and how he entered upon her and slept in her house and she cleaned his head, even though they were not mahrams or spouses.

Many of the scholars were of the view that Umm Haraam was one of the mahrams of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him); al-Nawawi even narrated that there was consensus among the scholars on this point. 
It says in Mataalib Ooli al-Nuha (5/34) – one of the Hanbali books: It was permissible for him to let a non-mahram woman ride behind him on his camel, because of the story of Asma’. And Abu Dawood narrated from a woman of Ghifaar that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) let her ride behind him on the back of his camel saddle. And it was permissible for him to be alone with them because of the story of Umm Haraam. 
The hadeeth of Asma’ referred to above was narrated by al-Bukhaari (4823) and Muslim (4050) from Asma’ bint Abi Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with them both), who said: I used to bring the date-stones from the land of al-Zubayr that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had allocated to him, (carrying them) on my head, and it was two-thirds of a farsakh (a farsakh = three miles) away. I came one day with the date-stones on my head, and I met the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and a group of the Ansaar were with him. He called me then made his camel kneel down so that I could ride behind him, but I felt too shy to travel with the men, and I remembered al-Zubayr and his protective jealousy (gheerah), for he was the most jealous of people. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) realized that I felt too shy so he went on his way. Then I came to al-Zubayr and told him that I had met the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) carrying the date-stones on my head, and there was a group of his companions with him, and he had made his camel kneel so that I could ride behind him, but I had felt too shy and I remember his (al-Zubayr’s) protective jealousy. He said: “By Allaah, for you to have to carry the date-stones is harder for me to bear than your riding with him.” She said: Then later on Abu Bakr sent me a servant to take care of the horse and it was as if I had been set free from slavery. 
The hadeeth of the woman from Ghifaar was narrated by Abu Dawood (313) from that woman of Banu Ghifaar who said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) let me ride behind him on the back of his camel-saddle. This was classed as da’eef by al-Albaani in Da’eef Abi Dawood.  
This is not one of the issues on which the scholars are unanimously agreed, rather some of them clearly stated that there was a difference of scholarly opinion on this point. Al-‘Iraaqi said in Tarh al-Tathreeb (5/167), concerning the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) entering upon Dubaa’ah bint al-Zubayr: He (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) entered upon Dubaa’ah to visit her when she was sick or to visit her because she was his relative as stated above. This points to his humility, upholding of kinship ties and concern for his relatives. It is to be interpreted as meaning that he was not alone with a woman in this case, because he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not sit alone with non-mahram women or shake hands with them. If he did do that then this does not mean that his infallibility was tarnished thereby, but they did not regard that as being one of his unique characteristics, thus he is like others with regard to this issue.
