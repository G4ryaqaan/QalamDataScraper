21502,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21502,Arranging the rows during prayer,"Many people do not know that it is from the sunnah to stand feet to feet and so during a jamaa'h, they leave a small gap in between. To what extent are we obliged to try and fill the gap by spreading our feet further apart? If the line is not straight, do we align ouselves to the person on our right, or the one on the left?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is obligatory for the Muslims to make their rows straight and compact and to close the gaps between them. That is done by standing shoulder-to-shoulder and foot-to-foot. 
It was narrated from Anas ibn Maalik that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Make your rows straight for I can see you behind my back.” 
Narrated by al-Bukhari, 686; Muslim, 425. 
It was narrated from ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Make your rows straight, stand shoulder to shoulder and close the gaps, and do not resist your brothers’ hands. Do not leave any gaps for the Shaytaan. Whoever complete a row, Allah will reward him, and whoever breaksa row, Allah will forsake him. 
Abu Dawood said: What is meant by “Do not resist your brothers’ hands” is that a man should be easy-going if his brother pushes him forwards or backwards to make the row straight. (‘Awn al-Ma’bood). 
Narrated by Abu Dawood, 666; al-Nasaa’i, 819. Classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 620. 
It was narrated that al-Nu’maan ibn Basheer said: 
“The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) turned to face the people and said, ‘Straighten your rows,’ three times, ‘for by Allah either you straighten your rows or Allah will create division among your hearts.’ And I saw men standing shoulder to shoulder, knee to knee, ankle to ankle.”                                                                            
Narrated by Abu Dawood, 662; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 616.  
Should a man look to his right or his left so that he can make the row straight? 
The Sunnah is for the imam to stand in the front, in line with in the middle of the row, then the rows should start from behind the imam, not from the right hand side of the mosque or the left, as some people do. Rather they should start from behind the imam, then the row should be completed to both the right and the left, so as to follow the Sunnah of having the imam in the middle.  
Based on this, then whoever is in the right half of the row should look to his left and align himself with whoever is on his left and whoever is in the left half should look to his right and align himself with whoever is on his right. 
With regard to the gaps between the feet, the worshipper should stand in a moderate fashion, neither standing with his feet together nor making them too far apart, because the further apart he makes them, the further his shoulders will be from his neighbour’s shoulders. Making the rows straight and compact is achieved by standing foot-to-foot and shoulder-to-shoulder.  
Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd said: 
One of the new things that we see some people doing, with no evidence in sharee’ah, is that in prayer they try to align themselves with a person on the right if they are on the right hand side of the row, or to align themselves with a person on their left if they are on the left hand side of the row, and they turn their feet inward so that their ankles are touching the ankles of the people next to them.  
This is something for which there is no basis in sharee’ah and it is going to the extreme in implementing the Sunnah. This is wrong on two counts.   
The alignment of the row should begin from where the imam is standing. Whoever is on the right of the row should align himself by looking at those who are to his left (i.e., closer to the imam). Thus the line will be straightened and the gaps will be filled. Alignment is done by lining up necks, shoulders and ankles, and by completing the front rows.   
But to try to spread the legs wide and turn the feet inward so that one's ankles touch one’s neighbours’ ankles is an obvious mistake and an exaggeration, and a new interpretation which is indicative of going to extremes in trying to apply the Sunnah. It causes annoyance and is not prescribed in sharee’ah, and it widens the gaps between people standing in prayer. 
That becomes apparent when the people prostrate, and when they stand up again they become distracted in trying to fill the gaps and turning their feet to make their ankles touch their neighbours’ ankles, which makes them miss out on what they should be doing, which is to make the toes point in the direction of the qiblah. 
Doing that is like competing with one’s neighbour and trying to take his place. All of that is not prescribed in sharee’ah.

    It was narrated from the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) that among the Signs of the Hour is that “zina (unlawful 
    sexual relationships) will become widespread.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 
    1/178). According to a report narrated by al-Haakim, “immorality will become 
    widespread.” During the internet age in which we are living, this hadeeth 
    has become true, and we see the reality of the events foretold by the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). No one can deny 
    this except one who is arrogant. The kaafirs recognized the seriousness of 
    the matter before the Muslims did. Now on the internet there are half a 
    million pornographic sites displaying immorality, and another 100 new sites 
    are added every day, spreading nakedness and immorality in the world. 

    The ratio of pornographic pages on the internet is almost 
    2.3% of all internet pages. (See the research web page

    The pornographic company Playboy claims 4.7 million visitors 
    to its website each week. (See the research web page

    Purchases of “permissive items” on the internet in 1999 
    accounted for 8% of all electronic sales which totalled $18 billion. The 
    amount of money spent on entering pornographic pages reached $970 million, 
    and is expected to rise to $3 billion in 2003. (See the research web page

    Some companies have studied the number of visitors to 
    pornographic web sites on the internet. The WebSideStory company found that 
    one of the pornographic sites received 280,034 visitors in one day; there 
    are more than one hundred similar sites that receive more than 20,000 
    visitors each day, and more than 2000 similar sites that receive more than 
    1400 visitors each day. Just one of these sites had received more than 
    43,613,508 visitors in two years. One of the people behind these sites 
    claimed to have more than three hundred thousand nude pictures which he had 
    distributed more than one billion times. Researchers at the Carnegie Mellon 
    University undertook a statistical study of 917,410 pictures which were 
    accessed 8.5 million times from 2000 cities in 40 countries, and they found 
    that half of the pictures accessed via the internet were pornographic, and 
    that 83.5 of the pictures circulated amongst newsgroups were pornographic.

    Yes, whatever the person who joins the prayer late catches up 
    with, with the imaam is the first part of his prayer. See Question no.
    23426. 

    And it is mustahabb to raise the hands when getting up after 
    the first Tashahhud. 

    But does the person who is one rak’ah behind the imam have to 
    raise his hands when getting up after saying the Tashahhud or not? 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was 
    asked about that and he said: 

    He should raise his hands, because it seems that the hands 
    should be raised when he gets up for the third rak’ah because he is getting 
    up after reciting the Tashahhud, and this applies to the one who joins the 
    prayer with the imam late. And Allaah knows best. 

    Note: 

    The questioner’s comment that raising the hands is obligatory

    Al-Maawirdi said, describing the tasks that the imam or ruler is obliged to do:
    There are ten things that he is obliged to do that have to do with public affairs:
    1 – He must preserve the religion according to its established bases and that on which the salaf of the ummah was unanimously agreed. If an 
    innovator or deviant or one who is confused about some issue emerges, he has to explain the proof to him and tell him what is correct, and deal 
    with him according to the set rights and punishments so that the religion will be protected against being undermined and the ummah will be 
    prevented from deviance.
    2 – He must judge between disputing parties and put an end to arguments so that justice and fairness will prevail, aggressors will not get carried 
    away and no person who is wronged will feel helpless.
    3 – He must guarantee public safety and security and protect the women and children of the ummah so that people can go about their business and 
    travel around in safety, with no danger to their persons or their wealth.
    4 – He must carry out hadd punishments so that the sacred limits of Allaah will not be transgressed and so that the rights of His slaves will be 
    protected.
    5 – He must reinforce the borders with equipment and forces so that the enemy will not find any opportunity to violate the borders of the Muslims 
    or shed their blood or the blood of non-Muslims living under the protection of the Islamic state.
    6 – He must strive in jihad against those who stubbornly reject Islam after being called to it, until they become Muslim or agree to live under 
    Muslim protection and pay jizyah, so that the rights of Allaah will be fulfilled and His religion will prevail over all others.
    7 – He must collect zakaah and charity money in the manner enjoined by the texts and scholarly consensus, without causing fear or being unjust.
    8 – He must work out what benefits etc are to be given to those who deserve them from the treasury of the Islamic state (bayt al-maal), without 
    being either extravagant or stingy; he must pay them on time, neither early nor late.
    9 – He must appoint people who are honest and sincere to different positions, so that things will be done efficiently and wealth will be kept with 
    trustworthy people. 
    10 – He should supervise matters directly himself, and check on things so that the ummah will be led in a proper manner. He should not rely on 
    delegating to others because he is too busy indulging in physical pleasures or worship, for he may end up delegating to a supposedly trustworthy 
    person who then betrays him, or a supposedly sincere person who then cheats him. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
    “O Dawood (David)! Verily, We have placed you as a successor on the earth; so judge you between men in truth (and justice) and follow not your 
    desire * for it will mislead you from the path of Allaah”
    [Saad 38:26]
    Allaah did not allow him to delegate to others without supervising them or excuse him from that; He even described that as misguidance. Even 
    though these are the duties of the khaleefah as stated in religion, these are also the duties of everyone who has anyone under his care. The 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Each of you is a shepherd and each of you is responsible for his flock.”
    If the imam fulfils the rights of the ummah that we have mentioned above, then he has discharged his duty towards Allaah and to them, and so he is 
    owed the two duties of obedience and support, unless he changes.",Islam Q&A

During the first two years I was happy with my marriage and I loved my wife, but after that I started to feel that I disliked my wife. That is not because of religion, because she is religiously committed and has a good character, praise be to Allaah. Rather it has to do with her beauty, because she is not beautiful enough to keep me chaste and make me lower my gaze. I am afraid of mistreating her because I do not feel happy with her and sometimes I frown at her for no reason. The problem is that I cannot marry another wife because I am not financially able. I thought of taking a loan in order to marry but then I would be living in poverty because of the loan. I have thought a lot about divorcing her and letting her go in kindness and replacing her with another, but I have children from her and she loves me a lot.

What should I do, may Allaah reward you.",,,"Praise be to Allah.My dear brother, I appreciate your confidence in me and I ask Allaah to make us and you strong and steadfast, and to guide us. With regard to your question, I offer the following comments: 
1 – The problem you have is not with regard to marrying a second wife, or divorcing your wife. The problem, as you mention, is a financial problem. So long as you are not able to marry another wife, then you should keep the wife with whom Allaah has blessed you. 
2 – Whenever you are able and have the financial means, and praise be to Allaah that He has permitted plural marriage to you… In my opinion that is easier for a woman to bear than divorce, especially since you have children from her. 
3 – Try to look at the matter from a different angle. You may find many positive things in her, and beauty is not everything, believe me. How she behaves and treats you… and many things which are ultimately more important than appearance. For with time you will get used to her appearance, and how she behaves will be what matters…  
4 – Imagine that you find a very beautiful woman and marry her… then she starts to treat you in an arrogant or impolite manner… or she treats you and your family badly… what would you do?! 
5 – You should be objective and not burden yourself with more than you can bear.  Look at the matter from different aspects. “it may be that you dislike a thing and Allaah brings through it a great deal of good” [al-Nisa’ 4:19 – interpretation of the meaning]. And remember the advice of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Look for one [a wife] who is religiously committed, may your hands be rubbed with dust [i.e., may you prosper]!”

Allaah says concerning dhikr (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Those who believed (in the Oneness of Allaah — Islamic Monotheism), and whose hearts find rest in the remembrance of Allaah verily, in the remembrance of Allaah do hearts find rest”
[al-Ra’d 13:28]

“And We send down of the Qur’aan that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe (in Islamic Monotheism and act on it)”
[al-Isra’ 17:82]
“O mankind! There has come to you a good advice from your Lord (i.e. the Qur’aan, enjoining all that is good and forbidding all that is evil), and a healing for that which is in your breasts, — a guidance and a mercy (explaining lawful and unlawful things) for the believers”
[Yoonus 10:57]
And He said concerning prayer (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, man (disbeliever) was created very impatient;
Irritable (discontented) when evil touches him;
And niggardly when good touches him.
Except those who are devoted to Salaah (prayers).
Those who remain constant in their Salaah (prayers)”
[al-Ma’aarij 70:19-23]
“O you who believe! Seek help in patience and As-Salaah (the prayer). Truly, Allaah is with As-Saabiroon (the patient)”
[al-Baqarah 2:153]
When something distressed the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) he would turn to prayer (Narrated by Ahmad and Abu Dawood, 1319; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’ no. 4703). 
And he used to say: “O Bilaal, give the call to prayer (iqaamah) and let us find rest in it.” Narrated by Ahmad, and Abu Dawood; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, no. 7892. 
Prayer brings comfort to the heart and is a delight, and is a remedy for worry and grief. 
Free time leaves the door open to bad thoughts and the distress, worry and anxiety that result from them.                          
Whenever you feel anxious and worried, hasten to do wudoo’ and pray, and read Qur’aan, and keep yourself busy with beneficial actions, especially the dhikrs for morning and evening, and when going to sleep, eating, drinking, and entering and leaving the home. 
The Muslim who believes in the will and decree of Allaah should not worry about his provision or children or the future in general, because that was written before he came into existence. Rather he should worry about his sins and shortcomings before his Lord, the way of dealing with which is to repent and hasten to do good deeds. Allaah has guaranteed the believers a good life, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Whoever works righteousness — whether male or female — while he (or she) is a true believer (of Islamic Monotheism) verily, to him We will give a good life (in this world with respect, contentment and lawful provision), and We shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion to the best of what they used to do (i.e. Paradise in the Hereafter)”

    should not be given to a kaafir. This is the view of Maalik, al-Shaafa’i and 
    Ahmad. (al-Mughni, 11/412). If the Muslim relatives of the man are 
    far away, then the children should be sent to them. If that is not possible 
    then the children should be given to a Muslim family to take care of them 
    and have custody of them. 

    The conditions of custody include the following: 

    Being Muslim, for custody cannot be given to a kaafir. 

    Being of sound mind, for custody cannot be given to one who 
    is insane or mentally deficient. 

    Being an adult, for custody cannot be given to a minor. 

    Being able to bring them up properly, for custody cannot be 
    given to one who will be negligent. 

    Ibn al-Qayyim said: 

    No custody can be given to a kaafir over a Muslim for two 
    reasons: 

    1 – The one who is given custody of a child will be keen to 
    bring him up in his religion and to teach him about it, and after he grows 
    up it will be difficult for him to change. He may change him from the 
    natural disposition of man with which Allaah has created His slaves, and 
    after that he may never come back to it, as the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Every child is born in a state of 
    fitrah (natural disposition of man), then his parents make him into a Jew or 
    a Christian or a Magian.” There is no guarantee that the one who has custody 
    will not turn a Muslim child into a Jew or Christian. 

    If it is said that the hadeeth only applies to the parents, 
    we should say that the hadeeth refers to the usual situation, which is that 
    a child usually grows up with his parents, but if one or both are lost, then 
    the child’s guardian among his relatives takes their place. 

    2 – Allaah has severed the ties of closeness between Muslims 
    and kaafirs, and has made the Muslims the close friends of one another, and 
    the kaafirs the close friends of one another. Custody is one of the 
    strongest reasons for creating close bonds, which Allaah has severed between 
    the two groups.

In sharee’ah terminology it means announcing the time of prayer. 
Majmoo’ al-Fatawa, 22/72. 
The adhan was prescribed at the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in Madeenah, after a dream seen by one of the Sahaabah. 
It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn Zayd ibn ‘Abd Rabbihi said: “When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) decided to use a bell, he did so reluctantly because that was like what the Christians did. Then at night whilst I was sleeping, a man walked around me [in my dream], wearing two green garments and carrying a bell in his hand. I said to him, ‘O slave of Allah, will you sell the bell?’ He said, ‘What will you do with it?’ I said, ‘I will call (the people) to prayer.’ He said, ‘Shall I not tell you of something better than that?’ I said, ‘What is it?’ He said, ‘Say: ‘Allahu akbar…’ (to the end of the adhan). The following morning I came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and told him what I had seen. He said, ‘It is a true dream, in sha Allah. Go out with Bilaal to the mosque and teach it to him, for he has a more melodious voice than you.’ I went out with Bilaal to the mosque, and I started teaching him the words and he was calling them out. ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab heard the voice from his house and came out dragging his lower garment and saying, ‘O Messenger of Allah! By Allah, I saw the same (dream) as him.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ‘To Allah be praise.’” 
Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 189; Abu Dawood, 499; Ibn Maajah, 706
This hadeeth was classed as saheeh by Ibn Khuzaymah, 1/189; Ibn Hibbaan, 4/572; al-Albaani in Tamaam al-Minnah, p. 145. 
The adhan is fard kifaayah (a communal obligation). The people of every town must have someone among them who can give the call to prayer so that the people may be informed that the time for prayer has come. 
The scholars of the Standing Committee said: 
The adhan is fard kifaayah (a communal obligation) in a town, and the same applies to the iqaamah. If a person starts to pray without the adhan or iqaamah, whether out of forgetfulness or ignorance, or for some other reason, the prayer is still valid. The same applies if the muezzin forgets the phrase al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm (prayer is better than sleep) in the adhan for Fajr prayer; the prayer is still valid even if there is still time left after he has finished his prayer (i.e., he does not have to repeat it). And Allah is the Source of strength; may Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions .

6- The act of worship must be in accordance with Shari`ah with regard to the place where it is done.",,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 

“Firstly: the worship must be in accordance with Shari`ah in its reasons. Any person who worships Allah by doing an act of worship that is not done for a reason proven in Shari`ah is doing an act of worship that will be rejected and is not enjoined by Allah and His Messenger. 

An example of that is celebrating the Mawlid or birthday of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), or celebrating the twenty-seventh night of Rajab, claiming that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was taken up into heaven on that night. This is not in accordance with Shari`ah so it is to be rejected. 

There is no historical proof that the Mi'raj (ascent into heaven) of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) took place on the twenty-seventh night of Rajab. The books of hadith that we have do not contain even a single letter that indicates that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was taken up into heaven on the twenty-seventh night of Rajab. It is known that this is the kind of information that cannot be accepted without sound isnads.
Even if it were proven, do we have the right to innovate some kinds of worship on that date or to make it a festival? Not at all. Hence when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came to Madinah and saw that the Ansar had two days on which they would play, he said: “Allah has replaced these for you with something better,” and he mentioned to them ‘Eid al-Fitr and ‘Eid al-Adha. This indicates that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) disliked any festival to be innovated in Islam apart from the Islamic festivals, of which there are three: the two annual ‘Eids, which are ‘Eid al-Fitr and ‘Eid al-Adha, and the weekly festival which is Friday. Even if it were proven that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was taken up into heaven on the twenty-seventh of Rajab – which it is impossible to prove – we cannot innovate anything on that occasion without the permission of the Lawgiver.

As I have said to you, bid’ah (innovation) is a serious matter which has a bad effect on the heart even if a person feels softness in his heart at that moment. For the matter will subsequently be the opposite, because if the heart rejoices in falsehood, that joy will not last, rather it will be followed by pain and regret. Every bid’ah is serious because it implies criticism of the Messenger, because this bid’ah implies that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not bring the complete Shari`ah, even though Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion” [Al-Maidah 5:3]
It is strange that you find some of those who indulge in these innovations strongly urge people to follow them, but they are negligent about matters which are more beneficial, more sound and more useful. 
Hence we say that celebrating the night of the twenty-seventh of Rajab as the night in which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was taken up into heaven is a bid’ah, because it is based on something that is not mentioned in Shari`ah. 

Secondly: the act of worship should be in accordance with Shari`ah in its type or nature.

For example, if a person were to sacrifice a horse, that would be contrary to the Shari`ah in the nature of the action. Because a sacrifice can only involve an animal of the an'am class, namely a camel, a cow or a sheep. 

Thirdly: the act of worship must be in accordance with Shari`ah in its amount. If someone were to say that he was going to pray Zuhr as six rak'ahs, would this act of worship be in accordance with Shari`ah? Not at all, because it is not in accordance with it in terms of the amount or number. If someone were to say Subhan Allah (Glory be to Allah), al-Hamdu Lillah (praise be to Allah) and Allahu akbar (Allah is Most Great) thirty-five times following a prescribed prayer, would this be correct? The answer is that if your aim is to worship Allah by saying it this number of times because you believe this is the proper way, then you are mistaken. If you deliberately add something to what the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has prescribed, but you believe that the proper way prescribed in Islam is thirty-three, then the extras are fine, because you are not suggesting that the higher number is the proper way that is prescribed. 
Fourthly: The act of worship must be in accordance with Shari`ah in how it is done. 

If a person does an act of worship that is acceptable in its type, amount and reason, but he goes against Shari`ah in the manner in which he does it, then it is not valid. For example, a man breaks wind etc. and does wudu, but he washes his feet and then wipes his head, then washes his hands, then washes his face – is his wudu valid? Not at all, because he has gone against Shari`ah in the way in which he did it. 

Fifthly: the act of worship must be in accordance with Shari`ah with regard to its timing. 

For example, if a person fasts Ramadan in Sha’ban, or in Shawwal, or he prays Zuhr before the sun has passed its zenith, or after the shadow of an object becomes equal in length to it – because if he prays before the sun has passed its zenith he is praying before the time has come, and if he prays after the shadow of an object becomes equal in length to it he is praying after the time has gone –his prayer is not valid. 
Hence we say that if a person deliberately does not pray until the time for that prayer is over, with no valid excuse, his prayer will not be accepted even if he prays a thousand times. Hence we follow an important principle in this regard which is that in the case of every act of worship that is to be done at a certain time, if a person does it outside of the proper time with no valid excuse, it will not be accepted, rather it will be rejected. 
The evidence for that is the hadith of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does an action that is not in accordance with this matter of ours (i.e., Islam) will have it rejected. 

Sixthly: the act of worship must be in accordance with Shari`ah with regard to the place where it is done. 

If a person stands in Muzdalifah on the day of ‘Arafah, this standing is not valid, because the act of worship is not in accordance with Shari`ah with regard to the place where it is done. Similarly, for example, if a person were to do i'tikaf in his own house, that would not be valid, because the place of i'tikaf is the mosque. Hence it is not valid for a woman to do i'tikaf in her house, because this is not the place for i’tikaf. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw some of his wives had set up tents in the mosque; he told them to take them down and not to do i’tikaf, but he did not tell them to do i'tikaf in their houses. This indicates that the women should not do i'tikaf in their houses because that goes against Shari`ah with regard to the place where it is done. 
So with regard to these six factors, an act of worship is not regarded as following Shari`ah unless it combines all six: 

Reason
Type
Amount
Manner
Time
Place

And Allah knows best.",Islam Q&A
21521,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21521,Can we do what we want?,"I have some questions about Islam, could you explain them for me? Are all of man’s actions, such as birth, death, his day-to-day behaviour, and all that he thinks about doing decreed by Allaah? Is our life programmed by Allaah before we are born? Or do we have freedom of choice and can we decide and do whatever we want, without that being controlled by Allaah? In brief, do we do whatever we want or what Allaah has created us to do?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It should be 
    noted that some of our circumstances are forced on us, and and we have no 
    choice in it, such as the day when a person is born, the colour of his skin 
    and eyes, and when he will die. All of these are matters over which people 
    have no control, rather they happen to them by force. Given that these are 
    matters in which people have no choice, they do not have anything to do with 
    Paradise or Hell, torment or blessing. 
But some 
    actions are the subject of choice, such as whether to believe or disbelieve, 
    or worldly matters such as choosing what to eat or drink, and where to 
    live. 
There is 
    nothing of that nature which is entirely outside the will and decree of 
    Allaah. 
But how does 
    that happen? 
Belief in 
    al-qadar (the divine will and decree) is one of the pillars of faith. The 
    Muslim’s faith cannot be valid unless he accepts that everything comes from 
    Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, 
    We have created all things with Qadar (Divine Preordainments of all things 
    before their creation as written in the Book of Decrees  
    Al-Lawh Al-Mahfooz)”
[al-Qamar 
    54:49]
Indeed, the 
    names of Allaah include al-Qaadir, al-Qadeer and al-Muqtadir (which refer to 
    His being All-Powerful). 
The heart of 
    the matter is that Allaah possesses the attributes of knowledge, power and 
    will. 
Based on 
    that, if people who do deeds want to do them, whether they are sins or acts 
    of obedience, then Allaah inevitably knows that, indeed He knew that in 
    eternity past, before He even created the universe. 
Then after 
    He knew it, He wrote it with Him, then when they wanted to do it, He willed 
    that they should do so. If He did not will that, then they would not do it. 
    He is All-Powerful,  and He is the Creator of people’s deeds because He is 
    the Creator of the human beings who do them. 
So all the 
    deeds of mankind are written with Allaah, because Allaah has prior knowledge 
    of them. This does not mean that Allaah compels people to do what they do, 
    rather they have freedom of choice with regard to their deeds. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, We showed him the way, whether he be grateful or 
    ungrateful”

    [al-Insaan 76:3]
But their 
    actions are not compelled by Allaah, for Allaah does not force His slaves to 
    do anything. 
Imaam Ibn 
    Abi’l-‘Izz al-Hanafi said concerning a similar matter: 
If it is 
    said, How can Allaah will something that He is not pleased with and does not 
    like? How can He will it and create it? How can His will be reconciled with 
    His hatred for it? 
It should be 
    said (in response) that this is the question which has caused divisions 
    among the people and has caused them to follow different paths and 
    opinions. 
It should be 
    noted that what is willed may be of two types: that which is willed or 
    wanted for itself, and that which is willed or wanted for something else. 
That which 
    is willed or wanted for itself is that which is wanted and loved for what it 
    is and for the goodness it contains. So it comes under the heading of aims 
    and goals.  That which is willed or wanted for something else may not be 
    what is wanted, but it serves a purpose; it may not serve any purpose in and 
    of itself, even though it may be a means to attain that which he wants and 
    is aiming for. So it may be something that is disliked in and of itself, but 
    he may seek it because it serves a purpose and helps him reach what he 
    wants. So in this case he will have two opposing feelings, his dislike (of 
    the means) and his desire (for the end). There is no contradiction, as these 
    feelings are related to different things.  This is like unpleasant medicine 
    which the one who takes it knows will cure him, or like cutting off a wasted 
    limb when he knows that will save the rest of his body, or travelling a 
    difficult route when he knows that it will bring him to what he wants and 
    loves. The wise man would rather accept the disliked thing on the basis that 
    he is likely to get good results even though the ultimate end may not be 
    quite certain. So how about Allaah, from Whom nothing is hidden? He may 
    dislike something but it may not be against His will for it to exist, 
    because it may be a means to an end, and it may be a means to something that 
    Allaah likes. For example, Allaah created Iblees, who is the cause of the 
    corruption of religions, deeds, beliefs and human wills; but nevertheless he 
    is a means to a lot of things that Allaah likes, which result from the 
    creation of Iblees. For these things to exist is dearer to Allaah than if 
    they did not exist at all.

21523,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21523,The authors of the Six Books,"Who are the authors of the Six Books, and are there any da’eef (weak) ahaadeeth in their books?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The authors of the Six Books are: 
1-Imam al-Bukhaari
2-Imam Muslim
3-Imam Abu Dawood
4-Imam al-Tirmidhi
5-Imam al-Nasaa’i
6-Imaam Ibn Maajah
There follow brief details about each of them. 
1 – Imam al-Bukhaari
His full name was Abu ‘Abd-Allaah Muhammad ibn Ismaa’eel ibn Ibraaheem ibn al-Mugheerah ibn Bardizbah al-Ja’fi al-Bukhaari. His grandfather al-Mugheerah was a freed slave of al-Yamaan al-Ja’fi, the governor of Bukhaarah, so he took his name after he became Muslim. Imam al-Bukhaari was born in Bukhaara in 194 AH. He grew up an orphan and started to memorize ahaadeeth before he was ten years old. When he was a young man he set out to travel to Makkah and perform the obligation of Hajj. He stayed in Makkah for a while, studying under the imams of fiqh, usool and hadeeth. Then he began to travel around, going from one Islamic region to another, for sixteen years in all. He visited many centers of knowledge where he collected ahaadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) until he had compiled more than 600,000 ahaadeeth. He referred to one thousand scholars of hadeeth and discussed these reports with them. These scholars were people who were known for their sincerity, piety and sound belief. From this huge number of ahaadeeth he compiled his book al-Saheeh, following the most precise scientific guidelines in his research as to their authenticity and in distinguishing the saheeh (sound) from the weak, and in finding out about the narrators, until he recorded in his book the most sound of the sound, although it does not contain all the saheeh ahaadeeth. The book’s full title is al-Jaami’ al-Saheeh al-Musnad min Hadeeth Rasool-Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) wa Sunanihi wa Ayaamihi. 
The governor of Bukhaara wanted al-Bukhaari to come to his house to teach his children and read ahaadeeth to them. But al-Bukhaari refused and wrote to him: “Knowledge is to be sought in its own house,” meaning that knowledge is to be sought not summoned. Whoever wanted to learn from the scholars should go to them in the mosque or in their houses. So the governor bore a grudge against him and ordered that he be expelled from Bukhaara. So he went to the village of Khartank which is near Samarqand, where he had relatives, and he settled there until he died in 256 AH at the age of 62. May Allaah have mercy upon him. 
2 – Imam Muslim
His full name was Muslim ibn al-Hajjaaj ibn Muslim al-Qushayri al-Nisapoori Abu’l-Husayn. He is one of the leading scholars of hadeeth and one of the most knowledgeable. He was born in Nisapoor on the day that Imam al-Shaafa’i died in 204 AH. He studied in Nisapoor, and when he grew up he traveled to Iraq and the Hijaaz to learn hadeeth. He heard ahaadeeth from many shaykhs, and many scholars of hadeeth narrated from him. The most famous of his books is his Saheeh which is known as Saheeh Muslim. This is one of the six reliable books of hadeeth. He spent nearly fifteen years compiling this book, which is second only to Saheeh al-Bukhaari in status and in the strength of its ahaadeeth. Many scholars have written commentaries on his Saheeh. 
His books also include Kitaab al-Tabaqaat, Kitaab al-Jaami’ and Kitaab al-Asma’, and others which exist in printed and manuscript form. He died in the city of Nasarabad, near Nisapoor, in 261 AH, at the age of 57. May Allaah have mercy on him. 
3 – Imam Abu Dawood
His full name was Sulaymaan ibn al-Ash’ath ibn Shaddaad ibn ‘Amr ibn Ishaaq ibn Basheer al-Azdi al-Sajistani, from Sajistan. Abu Dawood was the leading hadeeth scholar of his age. He is the author of al-Sunan, which is one of the six reliable books of hadeeth. He was born in 202 AH. He traveled to Baghdad where he met Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal and stayed with him; he also looked like him.  He also traveled to the Hijaz, Iraq, Khurasaan, Syria, Egypt and the borders of the Islamic world. Al-Nasaa’i, al-Tirmidhi and others narrated hadeeth from him. He attained the highest degree of piety and righteousness. His book al-Sunan includes more than 5300 ahaadeeth. 
The caliph Abu Ahmad Talhah (al-Muwaffaq al-‘Abbaasi) asked three things of him: the first was that he should move to Basrah and settle there, so that seekers of knowledge could come to him, thus bringing more people to settle there. The second was that he should teach al-Sunan to his children. The third was that he should give exclusive classes to his children, for the children of the caliph should not sit with the common people. Abu Dawood said to him: As for the first, yes; as for the second, yes; as for the third, no way, because all people are equal when it comes to knowledge. So the sons of al-Muwaffaq al-‘Abbaasi used to attend his lessons, and they would sit with a screen between them and the people. He remained in Basrah until he died in 275 AH. May Allaah have mercy on him. 
4 – Imam al-Tirmidhi
His full name was Muhammad ibn ‘Eesa ibn Soorah ibn Moosa ibn al-Dahhaak al-Salami al-Tirmidhi, Abu Eesa. He came from Tirmidh, once of the cities of Transoxiana, after which he was named. He was one of the leading scholars of hadeeth and memorization of hadeeth. He was born in 209 AH and studied under al-Bukhaari; they had some of the same teachers. He began to seek ahaadeeth by travelling to Khurasaan, Iraq and the Hijaz. He became famous for his memorization of hadeeth, trustworthiness and knowledge.  His shaykhs included Ahmad ibn Hanbal and Abu Dawood al-Sajistani. He compiled al-Jaami’ which is counted as one of the six reliable books of hadeeth. In this book he examined the ahaadeeth in detail, which is of benefit to students of fiqh, because he mentions the ahaadeeth and most of his ahaadeeth deal with rulings of fiqh. He mentions the isnaads and lists the Sahaabah who narrated the hadeeth, so what he believes is saheeh he says is saheeh, and what he believes is da’eef he says is da’eef. He explains who among the fuqaha’ accepted the hadeeth and who did not. His Jaami’ is the most comprehensive of the books of al-Sunan, and is the most useful to the muhaddith (hadeeth scholar) and faqeeh. His other works include Kitaab al-Shamaa’il al-Nabawiyyah and al-‘Ilal fi’l-Hadeeth. He was blind for the latter part of his life, after he had travelled around and compiled saheeh reports from prominent and well-versed scholars. He died in 279 AH at the age of 70. May Allaah have mercy on him. 
5 – Imam al-Nasaa’i
His full name was Ahmad ibn Shu’ayb ibn ‘Ali ibn Sinaan ibn Bahr ibn Dinar al-Nasaa’i, Abu ‘Abd al-Rahmaan. He came from the city of Nasa in Khurasaan, after which he was named (Nasawi or Nasaa’i). He was born in 215 AH, and he was one of the leading scholars and muhaddiths of his time. His comments on al-jarh wa’l-ta’deel (the study of the soundness or otherwise of narrators of hadeeth) are highly esteemed by the scholars. Al-Haakim said: I heard Abu’l-Hasan al-Daaraqutni say more than once, “Abu ‘Abd al-Rahmaan is the foremost among all scholars of hadeeth, and he is the best evaluator of narrators of his time.” 
He was extremely pious and righteous, and he used to regularly observe the best kind of fasting (the fasting of Dawood), he used to fast on alternate days. He lived in Egypt, where his books became famous and people learned from him. Then he moved to Damascus, where he died on Monday 13 Safar 300 AH, at the age of 85. May Allaah have mercy on him. 
6 – Imam Ibn Maajah
His full name was Muhammad ibn Yazeed al-Rab’i al-Qazwayni, Abu ‘Abd-Allaah. His father Yazeed was known as Maajah, so he was known as Ibn Maajah. The name al-Rab’i refers to Rabee’ah, after whom he was named because his father was a freed slave of Rabee’ah . He was a famous hafiz and the author of the book of hadeeth called al-Sunan. He was born in Qazwayn, after which he was named, in 209 AH. He travelled to Iraq, Basrah, Kufa, Baghdad, Makkah, Syria, Egypt and al-Rai to write down hadeeth. He wrote three books during his travels: a book on Tafseer; a book on history, in which he compiled the reports of men who had written down reports of the Sunnah from the time of the Sahaabah until his own time; and his book al-Sunan. Ibn Maajah died on Monday 22 Ramadaan 273 AH, at the age of 64. May Allaah have mercy on him. 
Ruling on the ahaadeeth in these books:
With regard to Saheeh al-Bukhaari and Saheeh Muslim, the ummah accepts the ahaadeeth that are contained in these books, and they are agreed that everything in them is saheeh apart from a very few phrases which al-Bukhaari and Muslim narrated in order to explain why they are not sound, either explicitly or implicitly, as the scholars who wrote commentaries on these two books, such as Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him), have explained. With regard to the other books of Sunan, they are not free of some da’eef (weak) ahaadeeth here and there. Some of them are noted as such by the authors themselves, and others have been pointed out by other scholars. They did not point out all the weak ahaadeeth, because they narrated the ahaadeeth with their isnaads, so it is easy for the scholars to tell the saheeh ahaadeeth from the da’eef by checking the chain of narrators and knowing who is reliable and who is weak.
 Among the famous scholars in this field were Ahmad, al-Daraqutni, Yahya ibn Ma’een, Ibn Hajar, al-Dhahabi, al-Waaqi and al-Sakhaawi. Among the contemporary scholars in this field are al-Albaani, Ahmad Shaakir and others. May Allaah have mercy on them all.
 And Allaah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
21524,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21524,Can the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) hear those who call upon him when he is in his grave?,"Some people believe that the Prophet Muhamamd [(peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)] is ""Shaheed"" and is in BArzakh where he can hear us if we send 'darood' on him and also if we ask his 'wasta' [by virtue of his closeness to Allah]in praying to God.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is alive in his grave in the sense of the life of al-barzakh, so he enjoys the blessings that Allah has prepared for him as a reward for his great good actions that he did in this world. But the life in the grave is not like the life of this world, or the life in the Hereafter. Rather it is the life of al-barzakh which comes in between his life in this world and his life in the Hereafter. Hence we know that he died as other Prophets and other people before him died. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And We granted not to any human being immortality before you (O Muhammad); then if you die, would they live forever?” [al-Anbiya’ 21:34] 
“Whatsoever is on it (the earth) will perish.
And the Face of your Lord full of Majesty and Honour will remain forever” [al-Rahmaan 55:26,27]
“Verily, you (O Muhammad) will die, and verily, they (too) will die” [al-Zumar 39:30]
And there are other verses which also indicate that Allah caused him to die. Moreover, the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) washed him, shrouded him, offered the funeral prayer for him and buried him; if he had been alive in the worldly sense, they would not have done the same as is done for others who die. 
Faatimah (may Allah be pleased with her) asked Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) for her inheritance from her father (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) because she was convinced that he had died, and no one among the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) differed with her concerning that. Rather Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) responded to her request by saying that nothing could be inherited from the Prophets.  
The Sahaabah agreed unanimously to choose a khaleefah for the Muslims to succeed the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him),  and that was done with the appointment of Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) as khaleefah. If the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had been alive in a worldly sense, they would not have done that. So this indicates that there was consensus among them that he had indeed died. 
When the tribulations (fitan) and problems increased during the time of ‘Uthmaan and ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with them both), and before and after that, they did not go to his grave to consult him or ask him for a way out of those tribulations and problems, or the way to solve them. If he had been alive in a worldly sense, they would not have overlooked that when they were in such great need of someone to save them from the trials that surrounded them.  
With regard to the soul of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), it is in the highest part of ‘Illiyyeen, because he is the best of creation, and because Allah has given him al-waseelah which is the highest position in Paradise. 
The life of al-barzakh is a special life. The Prophets and the shuhada’ (martyrs) are alive in al-barzakh as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The Prophets are alive and they pray in their graves.” (Narrated by al-Mundhiri and al-Bayhaqi who classed it as saheeh because of corroborating reports in al-Saheehayn.) 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And say not of those who are killed in the way of Allah, ‘They are dead.’ Nay, they are living, but you perceive (it) not” [al-Baqarah 2:154]
This is a special life, the nature of which is known to Allah. It is not like the life of this world in which the soul remains with the body.  
The basic principle concerning the dead is that they do not hear the words of the living sons of Adam, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“but you cannot make hear those who are in graves” [Faatir 35:22]
Allah confirmed that those whom he (the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)) was calling to Islam could not hear, by likening them to the dead. There is nothing in the Quran or in the saheeh Sunnah to indicate that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) can hear every du’aa’ or call from human beings. Rather it is proven that the only thing that reaches him (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the blessings and salaams of those who send blessings and salaams upon him. This was narrated by Abu Dawood, 2041, with a hasan isnaad from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no one who sends salaams upon me but Allah will restore to me my soul so that I may return his salaams.” This does not mean that he hears the words of the one who sends salaams. Rather it is possible that he comes to know of those salaams when the angels convey that to him. If we assume that he hears the words of the one who sends salaams, this is an exception from the general rule, as in the case of the dead hearing the footsteps of those who carry his bier, and as in the case of the slain kuffaar in the well at Badr who heard the call of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he said to them: “Have you found your Lord’s promise to be true? For we have found our Lord’s promise to be true.” (See Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 1/313, 318, 321). 
With regard to calling upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and asking him directly, this is the essence of shirk which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was sent to forbid and to fight against its people. For more details on the ruling on that, see Question no. 10289, 11402, 1439. We ask Allah to bring the Muslims back to the right path. And Allah knows best.

21525,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21525,Categories of religion,What are the different categories of religion that exist in the world?,,,"Praise be to Allah.People are divided according to their religions into two categories: 
1 – Those who have a Book that was revealed from Allah, such as the Jews, Christians and Muslims. The Jews and Christians, because of their lack of knowledge of what was narrated in their books, and because they took humans as lords instead of Allah, and because a long time has passed (since those Books were revealed), have lost their books which Allah revealed to their Prophets. So the rabbis and priests wrote books for them which they claimed came from Allah, but they are not from Allah, rather they are the work of forgers and the distortion of fanatics. 
With regard to the Book of the Muslims (the Holy Quran), it is the last of the Divine Books to be revealed, and the most reliable, and Allah has guaranteed to preserve it – He did not leave that to human beings. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Quran) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption)”
[al-Hijr 15:9]
It is preserved in men’s hearts and on paper, because it is the final Book in which is Allah’s guidance for mankind, and He has established it as proof against them until the Hour begins. He has decreed that it will abide and He has created for it in every age people who will follow its guidance, learn it by heart, implement its laws and believe in it.  
2 – Those who do not have a Book that was revealed from Allah, although they may have an inherited book that is attributed to the founder of their religion, such as the Hindus, Magians (Zoroastrians), Buddhists, Confucians and the Arabs before the coming of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
There is no nation that does not have knowledge or act according to what is in their best worldly interests. This is part of the general guidance that Allah has given to all people, and indeed to all animals, as He guides animals to eat food and drink that are good for them, and to avoid those that are harmful. Allah has created in them love for the former and hatred towards the latter. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most High,
Who has created (everything), and then proportioned it.
And Who has measured (preordainments for everything even to be blessed or wretched); and then guided (i.e. showed mankind the right as well as the wrong paths, and guided the animals to pasture).”

And Moosa (peace be upon him) said to Pharaoh: 
“Our Lord is He Who gave to each thing its form and nature, then guided it aright”

“Who has created me, and it is He Who guides me”

Every intelligent person – who has the slightest insight – knows that the followers of different religions have more beneficial knowledge and do more righteous deeds than those who are not followers of any religion, so there is nothing good to be found with the non-Muslim followers of other religions, and what the Muslims have is more perfect. The followers of different religions have something that others do not have. Knowledge and actions are of two types: 
The first type is knowledge that is acquired through mental reasoning, such as mathematics, medicine and manufacturing. These things are the same for followers of religion and for others, indeed they are more well versed in them. But with regard to matters which cannot be known merely through mental reasoning, such as divine knowledge and knowledge of religions, this is something that belongs only to the followers of religion. This includes matters for which rational evidence can be produced, and the Messengers guided mankind and pointed out to them the rational basis of this knowledge, thus it is rational and shar’i at the same time. 
The second type is that which can only be known from the words of the Messengers. There is no way to acquire this knowledge through mental reasoning. This includes information about Allah, His names and attributes, the reward in the Hereafter for those who obey Him, the punishment for those who disobey Him, His laws, and news of the earlier Prophets and their dealings with their nations.

Is it permissible for a Muslim to be a sincere friend to a person who is not Muslim?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for a Muslim to make friends with a mushrik or to take him as a close friend, because Islam calls on us to forsake the kaafirs and to 
    disavow them, because they worship someone other than Allaah. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you 
    who believe! Take not as friends the people who incurred the Wrath of Allaah 
    (i.e. the Jews). Surely, they have despaired of (receiving any good in) the 
    Hereafter, just as the disbelievers have despaired of those (buried) in 
    graves (that they will not be resurrected on the Day of Resurrection)”

    [al-Mumtahanah 60:13]
This was also the 
    teaching of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
1 – It was 
    narrated from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allaah be pleased with him) that he 
    heard the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) say, “Do not keep company with anyone but a believer and do not let 
    anyone eat your food but one who is pious.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2395; 
    Abu Dawood, 4832. Abu ‘Eesa al-Tirmidhi said: this hadeeth is hasan. It was 
    also classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 2519). 
Abu ‘Eesa 
    al-Khattaabi said: Rather he warned against keeping company with anyone who 
    is not pious and against mixing with them or eating with them, because 
    eating with a person instills friendship and love in the heart. 
He said: do 
    not make friends with anyone who is not pious; do not take him as a 
    companion with whom you eat and chat. 
(Ma’aalim 
    al-Sunan, Haamish Mukhtasar Sunan Abi Dawood, 7/185, 186). 
2 – It was 
    narrated from Samurah that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) said: “Do not live among the mushrikeen and do not mix with 
    them, for whoever lives among them or mixes with them is not one of us.” 
    (Narrated by al-Bayhaqi, 9/142; al-Haakim, 2/154. He said, it is saheeh 
    according to the conditions of al-Bukhaari. The hadeeth was also classed as 
    saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Silsilat al-Saheehah, 2/229 with its 
    corroborating reports). 
But it is 
    permissible to deal with them in a kind manner in the hope that they might 
    become Muslim. 
It was 
    narrated that Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: There was a Jewish 
    boy who used to serve the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him), and he fell sick. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) came to visit him. He sat by his head and said, “Become 
    Muslim.” (The boy) looked at his father who was with him, and he (the 
    father) said, “Obey Abu’l-Qaasim  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him).” So he became Muslim, and the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) went out, saying, “Praise be to Allaah Who has saved him from the Fire” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1290).

Etiquette of companionship between husband and wife in Islam","Praise be to Allah.Can a wife call husband by name in Islam?
There is nothing wrong with a woman calling her husband by his name, because there is no evidence to indicate that it is not allowed. But people’s customs and traditions should be taken into account in this matter. 
If the custom in some land is that a woman should call her husband by his Kunya (Abu So and so) for example, and they think that calling him by his name is ill-mannered, or if the husband does not like to be called by his name, then the women should pay attention to that, because she is required to treat her husband well and it is not good treatment to call him in a manner that he dislikes or that is regarded by people as not good. 
Each spouse should address the other by the name that he or she likes best, because that brings about love and affection . 
Etiquette of companionship between husband and wife in Islam
Al-Munawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Fayd Al-Qadir: 
“The etiquette of companionship : This includes: 
Keeping secrets; concealing faults; not telling him about the bad things that people say about him; telling him about good things that people say about him which will make him happy; listening attentively when he is speaking; avoiding arguments; calling him by the name that he likes best; praising him for his best obvious characteristics; thanking him for favours that he does; defending him in his absence; helping him when he needs help without waiting for him to ask; advising him in a gentle and indirect manner – if there is a need for that; forgiving him for his mistakes; not criticising him; praying for him in private when he is alive and after he dies; expressing joy at things that make him happy and sorrow at things that make him sad; greeting him first when meeting him; making room for him in a gathering; offering your place to him; seeing him out when he leaves; listening attentively when he speaks until he has finished speaking; and in general treating him as one would like to be treated .”

What does Islam say about people of other religions? Are all non-Muslim people regarded as sinners because they do not follow Allah and Islam? Can any non-Muslim person enter Paradise without following Islam?","Islam considers other religions to be either fabricated and false, or abrogated. The fabricated and false religions are those like the ancient Arabian practise of worshipping idols and stones. The abrogated religions are those which were taught by the Prophets who came before our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him).",,"Praise be to Allah.The ruling of Islam concerning other religions is that they are all either fabricated and false, or abrogated. 
The fabricated and false religions are those like the ancient Arabian practise of worshipping idols and stones. 
The abrogated religions are those which were taught by the Prophets who came before our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
They are valid in that their origins are from Allah, but Islam came and took their place, not with regard to basic beliefs such as the existence of God , the angels, Paradise and Hell, for these are matters which all the Messengers have in common, but there are differences between them with regard to ways of worshipping and drawing close to Allah by means of prayer, fasting, pilgrimage, alms, etc. 
The later followers of the Prophets have fallen into deviations of belief and Shirk (associating partners or equals with Allah), but Islam came to point that out and bring people back to the correct belief taught by the earlier Prophets. 
Abu Al-Darda (may Allah be pleased with him) said: `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) brought some pages of the Torah to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, “O Messenger of Allah, these are some pages of the Torah which I took from a brother of mine from (the tribe of) Banu Zurayq.” The expression of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) changed, and ‘Abdullah ibn Zayd (may Allah be pleased with him) – who had been shown the Adhan [in a dream] – said, “Has Allah taken away your mind? Do you not see the expression on the face of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)?” ‘Umar said, “We are pleased with Allah as our Lord and with Islam as our religion and with Muhammad as our Prophet and with the Quran as our guide.” Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) relaxed, and said, “By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, if Moses (peace be upon him) were to come among you and you were to follow him and leave me, you would have gone far astray. You are my share among the nations and I am your share among the Prophets.” (Narrated by Ahmad, 15437) 
Ibn Hajar said: 
“All the Isnads (chains of narration) of this Hadith are such that they could not be taken as evidence individually, but when taken together they prove that this Hadith is correct.” (Fath Al-Bari, 13/525) 
The evidence for that is the verse in which Allah says (interpretation if the meaning): 
“And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers” [Al ‘Imran 3:85]
Imam Al-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on this verse: 
“Allah means that whoever looks for a religion to follow other than Islam, Allah will never accept that from him, ‘and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers’ meaning, he will be of those who have deprived themselves of their share of the mercy of Allah.” (Tafsir Al-Tabari, 3/339) 
Islam does not regard them (followers of other religions) only as sinners, but as disbelievers who will abide forever in the Fire of Hell, as stated in the verse quoted above. 
The disbeliever will be a loser in Hell, and will not come out of it. It is not possible for a disbeliever to enter Paradise unless he becomes Muslim. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, those who reject Our verses (and signs) and treat them with arrogance, for them the gates of heaven will not be opened, and they will not enter Paradise until the camel goes through the eye of the needle (which is impossible). Thus do We recompense the (wicked) criminals.” [Al-A’raf 7:40]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “By the One in Whose Hand my soul is, no one of this nation, Jew or Christian, will hear of me and not believe in that with which I have been sent, but he will be one of the people of Hell.” (Narrated by Muslim)

21536,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21536,Correct view on the ruling on covering the face,"With regard to the niqaab, what are the ahaadeeth and aayaat that refer specifically to it?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The correct view is that a woman is obliged to cover her entire body, even the face and hands. Imam Ahmad said that even the nails of a woman are ‘awrah, and this is also the view of Maalik (may Allaah have mercy on them both). Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
“… It seems that the view of Ahmad is that every part of her is ‘awrah, even her nails, and this is also the view of Maalik.” 
(Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 22/110). 
In contrast to those who say that this is not obligatory, if we examine the views of those who say that it is not obligatory for women to cover the face, we will see that it is as Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd (may Allaah preserve him) said: 
“One of the following three scenarios must apply: 
1 – There is clear, sound evidence, but it has been abrogated by the verses that enjoin hijaab… 
2 – There is sound evidence but it is not clear, and it does not constitute strong evidence when taken in conjunction with the definitive evidence from the Qur’aan and Sunnah that the face and hands must be covered… 
3 – There is clear evidence, but it is not sound…” 
(Hiraasat al-Fadeelah, p. 68-69) 
With regard to the evidence that it is obligatory to cover the face and hands: 
1 – Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks (veils) all over their bodies (i.e. screen themselves completely except the eyes or one eye to see the way). That will be better, that they should be known (as free respectable women) so as not to be annoyed. And Allaah is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful”
[al-Ahzaab 33:59]
Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
“Allaah commands women to let the jilbaab come down (over their faces) so that they will be known (as respectable women) and not be annoyed or disturbed. This evidence supports the first opinion. ‘Ubaydah al-Salmaani and others stated that the women used to wear the jilbaab coming down from the top of their heads in such a manner that nothing could be seen except their eyes, so that they could see where they were going. It was proven in al-Saheeh that the woman in ihraam is forbidden to wear the niqaab and gloves. This is what proves that the niqaab and gloves were known among women who were not in ihraam. This implies that they covered their faces and hands.” 
(Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 15/371-372) 
2 – Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts) and not to show off their adornment except only that which is apparent (like both eyes for necessity to see the way, or outer palms of hands or one eye or dress like veil, gloves, headcover, apron), and to draw their veils all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms)…”
[al-Noor 24:31]
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: 
“With regard to the phrase ‘and not to show off their adornment except only that which is apparent’,  ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood said: the adornment which is apparent is the garment, because the word zeenah (adornment) was originally a name for the clothes and jewellery, as we see in the verses in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  
‘Take your adornment (by wearing your clean clothes)’
[al-A’raaf 7:31] 
‘Say (O Muhammad): Who has forbidden the adornment with clothes given by Allaah, which He has produced for His slaves’
[al-A’raaf 7:32] 
‘And let them not stamp their feet so as to reveal what they hide of their adornment’
[al-Noor 24:31]
Stamping the feet makes known the khulkhaal (anklets) and other kinds of jewellery and clothing. Allaah forbade women to show any kind of adornment except that which is apparent, but He allowed showing the hidden adornment to mahrams. It is known that the kind of adornment that usually appears, without any choice on the part of the women, is the clothing, as for the body, it is possible to either show it or to cover it. All of this indicates that what appears of the adornment is the clothing. 
Ahmad said: the adornment which is apparent is the clothing. And he said: every part of a woman is ‘awrah, even her nails. It was narrated in the hadeeth, ‘The woman is ‘awrah,’ This includes all of the woman. It is not makrooh to cover the hands during prayer, so they are part of the ‘awrah, just like the feet. Analogy implies that the face would be ‘awrah were it not for the fact that necessity dictates that it should be uncovered during prayer, unlike the hands.” 
Sharh al-‘Umdah, 4/267-268. 
3 – It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah said: “The riders used to pass by us when we were with the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in ihraam. When they came near, each of us would lower her jilbaab from her head over her face, and when they passed by we would uncover (our faces).” 
Narrated by Abu Dawood, 1833; Ahmad, 24067 
Shaykh al-Albaani said in Jilbaab al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah (107): its isnaad is hasan because of the existence of corroborating reports. 
It is well known that a woman should not put anything over her face when she is in ihraam, but ‘Aa’ishah and the Sahaabiyaat (women of the Sahaabah) who were with her used to lower part of their garments over their faces because the obligation to cover the face when non-mahrams pass by is stronger than the obligation to uncover the face when in ihraam. 
4 – It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: “May Allaah have mercy on the women of the Muhaajireen. When Allaah revealed the words (interpretation of the meaning)
 ‘and to draw their veils all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms)…”
[al-Noor 24:31], they tore their aprons and covered their faces with them.” 
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4480) 
5 – It was narrated from ‘Aa’ishah… that Safwaan ibn al-Mu’attal al-Sulami al-Dhakwaani was lagging behind the army. He came to where I had stopped and saw the black shape of a person sleeping. He recognized me when he saw me, because he had seen me before hijaab was enjoined. I woke up when I heard him saying ‘Inna Lillaahi wa inna ilayhi raaji’oon (verily to Allaah we belong and unto Him is our return),’ when he saw me, and I covered my face with my jilbaab.” 
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3910; Muslim, 2770) 
6 – It was narrated from ‘Abd-Allaah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The woman is ‘awrah and when she goes out the Shaytaan gets his hopes up.” 
(Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1173). 
Al-Albaani said in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi (936): It is saheeh.

The one who does that will be rewarded by Allah for this good deed. 
Allah has commanded us to venerate the mosques as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“In houses (mosques) which Allah has ordered to be raised (to be cleaned, and to be honoured), in them His Name is remembered [i.e. Adhaan, Iqaamah, Salaah (prayers), invocations, recitation of the Quran]. Therein glorify Him (Allah) in the mornings and in the afternoons or the evenings,
Men whom neither trade nor sale (business) diverts from the remembrance of Allah (with heart and tongue) nor from performing As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as-Salaah) nor from giving the Zakah. They fear a Day when hearts and eyes will be overturned (out of the horror of the torment of the Day of Resurrection)” [al-Noor 24:36-37]
al-Suyooti said: In this verse there is the command to venerate the mosques and cleanse them of idle talk and impure things. From Tafseer al-Qaasimi, 12/214 
Another sign that points to the virtue of the one who takes care of that is the report in al-Saheehayn from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah, that a black man or a black woman used to take care of the mosque, then he or she died. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked after him (or her) and was told that he had died. He said: “Why did you not inform me? Show me his grave (or her grave).” Then he went to the grave and offered the funeral prayer over it.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 458; Muslim, 956. 
And it was narrated by Abu Dawood (455), al-Tirmidhi (594) and Ibn Maajah (759) that ‘Aa’ishah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded that mosques be built among houses and that they be cleaned and perfumed.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, no. 487.  
What is meant by “among houses” is in neighbourhoods and among tribes. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) regarded spitting in the mosque as a sin and said that the expiation for that was burying it. In al-Saheehayn it is narrated that Anas said: The Messenger of Allah (S) said: “Spitting in the mosque is a sin and its expiation is burying it.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 415; Muslim, 552. 
Al-Nasaa’i (728) and Ibn Maajah (762) narrated from Anas that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw some sputum in the qiblah of the mosque and he got so angry that his face turned red. Then a woman from among the Ansaar came and scratched it and put some perfume in that place. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “What a good deed this is.” This hadith was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Nasaa’i and Saheeh Ibn Maajah. 
And it was proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) removed that himself as was narrated in al-Saheehayn where it says that ‘Aa’ishah said: “He saw some sputum on the wall of the mosque and scratched it off.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 407; Muslim, 549. 
And there are da’eef ahaadeeth narrated concerning that which we will quote here only in order to explain that they are weak. In the saheeh reports from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) there is sufficient evidence that we have no need of the weak reports.  
Abu Dawood (461) and al-Tirmidhi (2916) narrated the hadith, “I was shown the rewards of my ummah for different deeds, even a speck of dirt that someone removes from the mosque.” This hadith was classed as da’eef by al-Albaani in Da’eef al-Tirmidhi. 
Ibn Maajah (757) narrated a hadith, “Whoever removes anything harmful from the mosque, Allah will build for him a house in Paradise.” This hadith was classed as da’eef by al-Albaani in Da’eef ibn Maajah. 
With regard to looking after the imam, Imam Muslim said in the introduction to his Saheeh:  
“The man of high status should be given the respect to which he is entitled, and the one who has a low level of knowledge should not be elevated above his status. Every person should be given his due (of respect) and should be honoured in accordance with his status. It was narrated from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that she said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded us to give people due respect.” 
If the imam is a person of virtue, knowledge and righteousness, then love for him comes under the heading of loving and respecting the righteous. This is a righteous deed. 
But it should be noted that the matter should not be allowed to go to the extreme of seeking blessing (barakah) from the imam or touching him (for the purpose of seeking blessing) as some people do, for this is not part of the teaching of the earliest Muslims, either their imams or their scholars.

          Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah was asked about a man who 
          made du’aa’ in ungrammatical language, and a man said to him that Allaah 
          would not accept a du’aa’ spoken in ungrammatical language. 
 
          He replied: 
 
          Whoever voiced this opinion is a sinner who has gone 
          against the Qur’aan and Sunnah and the view of the salaf. For whoever 
          calls upon Allaah, devoting his worship sincerely and purely to Him, 
          calling upon him with a du’aa’ that is permissible, Allaah will listen 
          to him and respond to his du’aa’, whether it is in proper Arabic or 
          in ungrammatical language. The opinion mentioned has no basis, rather 
          the one who makes du’aa’, if he is not used to speaking in grammatical 
          Arabic, he should not force himself to do so. One of the salaf said, 
          if a person forces himself to speak grammatical Arabic, he will not 
          be focused in his heart. Similarly it is makrooh to force oneself to 
          make the words of the du’aa’ rhyme; if that happens spontaneously, then 
          it is fine, for the du’aa’ should come from the heart, and the tongue 
          should simply follow the heart. Whoever focuses in his du’aa’ on making 
          the words  grammatically correct will have less focus in his heart. 
          Therefore the one who is in urgent need should pray from the heart with 
          whatever words Allaah inspires him to say, without preparing it beforehand.    
          This is something which every believer finds in his heart. It is permissible 
          to make du’aa’ in Arabic or in languages other than Arabic. Allaah knows 
          the desire of the one who is making du’aa’, even if he cannot speak

It is permissible for one who has done tayammum to lead in prayer people who have done wudoo’, for one who has done wudoo’ to lead people who have done tayammum, for one who has wiped over his socks to lead those who have washed their feet and for one who has washed his feet to lead people who have wiped over their socks, because each of those whom we have mentioned has done what he is obliged to do. None of them is more taahir (pure) than another, and none of them is more complete in prayer than another. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoined that when the time for prayer comes, the one who has most knowledge of the Quran should lead them in prayer; he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not specify anything other than that. If there had been any obligation other than that which he mentioned, he would have explained it and would not have neglected it – Allah forbid. This is the view of Abu Haneefah, Abu Yoosuf, Zafar, Sufyaan, al-Shaafa’i, Dawood, Ahmad, Ishaaq and Abu Thawr. That was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas, ‘Ammaar ibn Yaasir and a group of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them). It is also the view of Sa’eed ibn al-Musayyib, al-Hasan, ‘Ataa’, al-Zuhri and Hammaad ibn Abi Sulaymaan. 
It was narrated that ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib disallowed that, and said that one who has done tayammum should not lead in prayer people who have done wudoo’, and one whose wudoo’ is valid for a limited period should not lead those whose wudoo’ is valid indefinitely. Al-Rabee’ah said: one who has done tayammum because of janaabah (impurity because of sexual activity) should not lead anyone in prayer except others who are in the same state. This was also the view of Yahyaa ibn Sa’eed al-Ansaari. 
Muhammad ibn al-Hasan and al-Hasan ibn Hayy said: he should not lead them in prayer. 
Maalik and ‘Ubayd-Allah ibn al-Hasan said that he should not lead them in prayer, but if he does then the prayer is valid. 
Al-Oozaa’i said: he should not lead them in prayer unless he is an ameer (leader). 
‘Ali – i.e., Ibn Hazm – said: there is no evidence for disallowing that or regarding it as makrooh, either from the Quran or the Sunnah or from scholarly consensus (ijmaa’) or from analogy (qiyaas); the same applies to categorizing people in that manner. And Allah is the Source of strength.","Al-Muhallaa, 1/367, 368"
21565,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21565,The better of them is the one who does more naafil actions,"If someone works on a task and follows more sunnah's while another person follows less sunnah's, does that mean that there is more noor (light) in the first persons task ?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Regularly performing Sunnah actions is one of the causes of 
    Allaah loving a person, as it says in the hadeeth narrated by al-Bukhaari 
    (6502) from Abu Hurayrah who said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah says: ‘Whosoever shows enmity 
    to someone devoted to Me, I shall be at war with him. My servant draws not 
    near to Me with anything more loved by Me than the religious duties I have 
    enjoined upon him, and My servant continues to draw near to Me with 
    supererogatory works so that I shall love him. When I love him I am his 
    hearing with which he hears, his seeing with which he sees, his hand with 
    which he strikes and his foot with which he walks. Were he to ask 
    [something] of Me, I would surely give it to him, and were he to ask Me for 
    refuge, I would surely grant him it.” 

    This hadeeth also indicates that Allaah helps and supports 
    the one who does a lot of naafil actions and protects his physical 
    faculties: his hearing, sight, hand and foot. 

    Al-Khattaabi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    What is meant is that Allaah helps and guides His slave in 
    the actions that these faculties do… He guides his physical faculties and 
    protects him against falling into that which Allaah dislikes, such as 
    listening to idle talk that he may hear, or looking at that which Allaah has 
    forbidden, or striking that which it is not permissible for his hand to 
    strike, or walking towards falsehood with his feet. 

    Someone else said: His limbs do not move except with the help 
    of Allaah and for the sake of Allaah, and they all strive for the sake of 
    the truth. Fath al-Baari, 11/352. 

    No doubt the one who is like this, all his deeds are light 
    (noor) and are guided by Allaah, and that increases the more naafil deeds he 
    does.  

    But we cannot be certain that a particular person’s actions 
    have more light and guidance than another’s just because he does a lot of 
    naafil actions, because we cannot say whether Allaah has accepted these 
    naafil deeds. This is a matter of the unseen which no one knows except 
    Allaah. But it seems that if a person is given the choice between two 
    actions and he chooses that which is more liked by Allaah and closer to the 
    Sunnah, there is the hope that he will be guided and helped by Allaah.

Does he have to repeat his prayer after he finds either of them?,,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          Ibn Hazm said: 
 
          Whoever is detained, whether he is traveling or not, 
          in such a state that he cannot find dust or water, or he is being crucified, 
          and the time for prayer comes, then he should pray as he is, and his 
          prayer will be complete and does not have to be repeated, whether he 
          finds water within the time of the prayer or after the time is over. 
 
          The proof of that is the aayahs (interpretation of the 
          meaning): 
 
          “So 
          keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you can”
          [al-Taghaabun 64:16]
 
          “Allaah burdens not a person beyond his scope”[al-Baqarah 
          2:286]
 
          And the Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If I command you 
          to do a thing, then do as much of it as you can.” 
 
          And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
 
          “… while He has explained to you in detail what is 
          forbidden to you, except under compulsion of necessity?”[al-An’aam 6:119]
 
           From these texts we see  that we are not obliged 
          to do more than we are able to, and that if we are unable to do something, 
          we are relieved of the obligation. We learn that Allaah has forbidden 
          us to neglect wudoo’ or tayammum for prayer, unless we are forced “under 
          compulsion of necessity”. The one who is deprived of water and dust 
          is forced by necessity to do something which is forbidden, i.e., to 
          forgo purifying himself with water or dust; so the prohibition does 
          not apply in his case. But he is able to pray, fulfilling all the rulings 
          on prayer and believing it to be obligatory, so it remains for him to 
          do that which he is able to do. If he prays as we have mentioned, then 
          he has prayed as Allaah has commanded him to do, and whoever prays as 
          Allaah has commanded him to do is not to blame. And hastening to pray 
          at the beginning of the time for prayer is preferable, because of what 
          we have stated above. 
 
          Abu Haneefah, Sufyaan al-Thawri and al-Oozaa’i said, 
          concerning one who is in this situation, that he should not pray until 
          he finds water, when he finds it.","Al-Muhallaa, 1/363, 364"
21574,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21574,Zakah on company shares,"I hope that you can give me an idea about how to pay zakah on shares, and if the company already pays zakah, am I obliged to pay zakah too?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The zakah on shares is obligatory upon the owners of the shares. It may be paid on their behalf by the company if that is stated in the company’s constitution, or it is decided by the board of directors, or if the law of the land obliges companies to pay zakah, or if the shareholder authorizes the company to pay zakah on his shares. 
Secondly:
The company should pay zakah on the shares just as an individual pays zakah on his wealth, in the sense that all the money of the shareholders is to be considered like the wealth of one person, and zakah is calculated on that basis, depending on the category of wealth on which zakah is obligatory, the nisaab (minimum threshold), the amount on which zakah is to be paid, and other matters which are to be taken into account with regard to the zakah to be paid by an individual. This is based on the principle of khultah (collectivity), according to the fuqaha’ who apply this to all kinds of wealth, excluding the amount of shares on which zakah is not obligatory, such as shares belonging to the public treasury, charitable waqfs, charitable organizations, and shares belonging to non-Muslims. 
Thirdly:
If the company does not pay zakah on its wealth for any reason, then the shareholders are obliged to pay zakah on their shares. If the shareholder can find out from the company’s statements how much the company would have to pay in zakah if it did pay zakah in the manner described above, then he should pay zakah on that basis, because this is the basic principle with regard to paying zakah on shares. 
If the shareholder is not able to find that out: 
If he holds shares in the company with the intention of benefiting from the annual profits of the shares, and not for the purpose of trading in those shares, then he should pay the zakah similar to that paid on things that are rented out, in accordance with the resolution of the Islamic Fiqh Council (Majma’ al-Fiqh al-Islami) passed during its second session, with regard to the zakah on real-estate and non-agricultural land that is rented out. The owner of these shares does not pay zakah on the value of the shares, rather he pays zakah on the profits, which is 2.5% after one year has passed from the day when he acquired that profit, bearing in mind the conditions of zakah and provided that there are no impediments.
 If the shareholder bought the shares with the intention of trading, then the zakah on the shares is the same as zakah on trade goods. If one year has passed and they are still in his possession then he should pay zakah on the value of the shares, based on the evaluation of experts, and he should pay 2.5% of that value and of the profit, if the shares have made any profit. 
Fourthly: 
If the shareholder sells his shares during the year, he should include their price in his wealth and pay zakah on it after one year has passed. The purchaser should pay zakah on the shares that he has bought in the manner described above.

21575,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21575,"What are the best fields of worldly work, employment or trade?","What are the best fields of worldly work, employment or trade?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah was asked the following question: 
I ask the shaykh and imaam, the follower of the salaf (earlier generations) and the leader of the later generations, the most knowledgeable man whom I have met in the east or the west, Taqiy al-Deen Abu’l-Abbas Ahmad Ibn Taymiyah, to explain to me the best means of earning a living. 
He (may Allah have mercy on him) answered as follows: 
The best way of earning a living is to put one’s trust in Allah and have faith that He is Able to take care of you, and to think well of Him. That means that one who is keen to earn a living should turn to Him and call upon Him, as Allah said, according to the report (hadeeth qudsi) in which His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “ ‘All of you are hungry except those whom I feed; ask Me for food and I will feed you. All of you are naked except those whom I clothe. Ask Me to clothe you and I will clothe you.’” And al-Tirmidhi narrated from Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Let each one of you ask his Lord for whatever he needs, even if it is a thong for his sandal when it breaks, for if Allah does not make it easy for him, he will not be able to fix it.” (A similar reports from Umm al-Mu’mineen ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) has been classed as saheeh. See al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah, no. 1362). 
Allah says in His Book (interpretation of the meaning): 
“… and ask Allah of His Bounty”
[al-Nisa’ 4:32 – check this is the right quote] 
“Then when the (Jumu‘ah) Salah (prayer) is ended, you may disperse through the land, and seek the Bounty of Allah (by working)…”[al-Jumu’ah 62:10]
Although this refers to Jumu’ah (Friday prayers), the meaning applies to all the prayers. 
Hence – and Allah knows best – the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told us to say when entering the mosque, “Allahumma iftah li abwaab rahmatika (O Allah, open to me the gates of Your mercy),” and when leaving the mosque to say, “Allahumma inni as’aluka min fadlika (O Allah, I ask You of Your Bounty).” And Ibraaheem the close friend of Allah (peace be upon him) said:  
“so seek your provision from Allah (Alone), and worship Him (Alone), and be grateful to Him”
[al-‘Ankaboot 29:17 – interpretation of the meaning]
This is a command, and a command demands a response. So seeking the help of Allah, turning to Him with regard to the matter of provision and other matters, is an important principle. 
Then one should seek to earn money with self-respect and pride, so that Allah may bless it for him; one should not take it with an attitude of desperation and greed. Rather money should be like the toilet, which one needs but which does not hold any special place in one’s heart. Striving to earn money should be like striving to fix the toilet. According to a marfoo’ hadeeth which was narrated by al-Tirmidhi and others, “Whoever wakes up and this world is his main concern, Allah will make him scattered and shattered, and he will feel a sense of panic and loss, and he will get nothing of this world except that which was already decreed for him. But whoever gets up and is mostly concerned about the Hereafter, Allah will cause him to feel focused and content, and will give him a feeling of being independent, and worldly gains will come to him willingly or unwillingly.” 
One of the salaf said: You are in need of this world but you are in greater need of your share of the Hereafter. If you start with your share of the Hereafter, then your share of this world will automatically come with it. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And I (Allah) created not the jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone).
I seek not any provision from them (i.e. provision for themselves or for My creatures) nor do I ask that they should feed Me (i.e. feed themselves or My creatures).
Verily, Allah is the All-Provider, Owner of Power, the Most Strong” [al-Dhaariyaat 51:56-58]
With regard to specifying a particular means of earning a living, whether it be in industry, business, construction, farming, etc., this varies from one person to another. I do not know of any general ruling, but if there is a direction that a person wants to take, then let him seek the guidance of Allah and pray istikhaarah as taught by the teacher of all good (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), for there is such great blessing in that that it cannot be comprehended, then whatever is made easy for him, he should be content with that, unless it is something which is objectionable on Islamic grounds.","Quoted from the essay al-Wasiyyah al-Jaami’ah li Khayr al-Dunya wa’l-Aakhirah, by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him), published by al-Maktabah al-Salafiyyah, Cairo"
21576,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21576,Slandering callers and reformers,In recent days there has been a lot of slander against those who call people to Islam (daa’iyahs) and dividing them into groups and categories. What is your opinion on that?,,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          Allaah has enjoined justice and good treatment of others, 
          and He has forbidden wrongdoing, hatred and enmity. Allaah sent His 
          Prophet Muhammad 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with the same message as 
          He sent all the Messengers, namely the call to Tawheed and to worship 
          of Allaah alone. He commanded him to establish justice and forbade him 
          to do the opposite, i.e., to worship anything other than Allaah, to 
          cause division and to transgress against the rights of others. 
 
          In these days it has become very common that people who 
          claim to have knowledge and to be calling people to good slander many 
          of their brothers among the well-known daa’iyahs, and they talk about 
          the seekers of knowledge, daa’iyahs and lecturers. They do that in secret 
          in their own gatherings, but it may be recorded on tapes that are distributed 
          among the people, and they may do it openly in public lectures in the 
          mosques. This behaviour goes against the commands of Allaah and His 
          Messenger in several ways. 
 
          1 – It is a transgression against the rights of the Muslims, 
          and against the elite of the people, namely the seekers of knowledge 
          and daa’iyahs who are striving to make the people aware and to teach 
          them and correct their beliefs and practices, and to organize lessons 
          and lectures, and to write beneficial books. 
 
          2 – It splits the Muslims and causes division in their 
          ranks. They are the most in need of unity and they need to keep away 
          from division, discord and too much gossip amongst themselves, especially 
          when the daa’iyahs who are being slandered are from among the Ahl al-Sunnah 
          wa’l-Jamaa’ah who are well known for their opposition to bid’ah (innovation) 
          and myth, and for standing up against those who promote such things, 
          and for exposing their plots and tricks. We see no benefit to be gained 
          by such actions, except for the enemies who lie in wait for opportunities 
          to harm the Muslims, such as the kaafirs, hypocrites and followers of 
          bid’ah and misguidance. 
 
          3 – This action offers support and help for the self-serving 
          among the secularists, westernizers and other heretics who are well 
          known for stirring up trouble among the daa’iyahs and telling lies against 
          them, and inciting people against them in their writings and recordings. 
          It is contrary to Islamic brotherhood for those who are too hasty to 
          help their enemies against their brothers among the seekers of knowledge, 
          daa’iyahs and others. 
 
          4 – This spreads corrupts ideas in the hearts and minds 
          of the common folk and elite; it spreads and propagates lies and false 
          rumours, and causes a great deal of backbiting and slander. It leaves 
          the door wide open to evil people who persist in spreading doubts and 
          stirring up fitnah, and who are keen to cause harm to the believers 
          by accusing them of things that they did not do. 
 
          5 – Much of what is being said has no basis in reality; 
          rather these are illusions which the Shaytaan has made attractive to 
          them, through which he has tempted them. Allaah says (interpretation 
          of the meaning):
 
           “O you who believe! Avoid much suspicion; indeed 
          some suspicions are sins. And spy not, neither backbite one another…”[al-Hujuraat 
          49:12] 
 
          The believer should interpret what his Muslim brother 
          says in the best possible way. One of the salaf said: Never think of 
          something that is said by your brother as being bad when you still find 
          room for a good interpretation. 
 
          6 – Whatever ijtihaad is produced by some scholars or 
          seekers of knowledge, in areas where ijtihaad is permitted, the author 
          of said ijtihaad cannot be blamed or rebuked for it, so long as he is 
          qualified to engage in ijtihaad. If someone else has a different opinion, 
          it is better for him to debate with him in a proper manner, striving 
          to reach the truth via the shortest route and leaving no room for the 
          insinuating whispers of the Shaytaan or for him to cause trouble among 
          the believers. If that is not possible, and someone thinks that he has 
          no choice but to explain what is wrong with his ijtihaad, then he should 
          choose the best wording and the most subtle way of explaining, and not 
          resort to attacking, slandering or going to extremes in criticizing 
          him, which may cause others to reject the truth or to turn away from 
          it. He should also avoid criticizing specific people, casting aspersions 
          upon their intentions or saying unnecessary or irrelevant things about 
          them. In such cases the Messenger 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would say, “What is the 
          matter with some people who say such and such…?” 
 
          The advice I offer to these brothers who have fallen 
          into the sin of slandering the daa’iyahs is to repent to Allaah for 
          the things that they have written or said that may have corrupted the 
          hearts of some youth and filled them with hatred and grudges, and kept 
          them from seeking beneficial knowledge or from calling people to Allaah 
          by making them preoccupied with gossip and talking about this one and 
          that one, and seeking out faults for which they could criticize people, 
          and going to extremes in doing that. 
 
          I also advise them to offer expiation for the things 
          that they have done by writing and other means that they think they 
          should not have done, and to remove from people’s minds the wrong ideas 
          they may have given them. They should focus on fruitful actions which 
          will bring them closer to Allaah and will be beneficial to people, and 
          they should beware of being too hasty to accuse people of kufr, fisq 
          and bid’ah without any clear evidence or proof. The Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever says to his 
          brother ‘O kaafir!’ one of them will be deserving of that description.” 
          (Saheeh, agreed upon). 
 
          It is prescribed for those who call others to the truth 
          and for seekers of knowledge, if they are uncertain about something 
          said by a scholar or anyone else, to refer to the prominent scholars 
          and to ask them, so that they can explain the facts of the matter to 
          them and remove the confusion and doubt from their minds, in accordance 
          with the words of Allaah in Soorat al-Nisaa’ (interpretatiuon of the 
          meaning): 
 
          “When there comes to them some matter touching (public) 
          safety or fear, they make it known (among the people); if only they 
          had referred it to the Messenger or to those charged with authority 
          among them, the proper investigators would have understood it from them 
          (directly). Had it not been for the Grace and Mercy of Allaah upon you, 
          you would have followed Shaytaan (Satan), save a few of you”[al-Nisaa’ 
          4:83]
 
          And Allaah is the One Whom we ask to reform all the Muslims 
          and to unite their hearts in taqwa and to bring the scholars of the 
          Muslims and those who call to the truth together in doing that which 
          pleases Him and will benefit His slaves. May He unite them in following 
          guidance and protect them against all the causes of division and dissent; 
          may He support the truth through them and humiliate falsehood through 
          them, for He is the One Who is able to do that. May Allaah bless our 
          Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions, and those who follow 
          his guidance until the Day of Resurrection.","Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah li Samaahat al-Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him), vol. 7, p. 311"

The jurists defined lending as permitting someone to benefit from an item which will remain to be returned to its owner afterwards. 
This definition excludes things that can only be benefited from by destroying or consuming them, such as food and drink. 
What is the ruling on lending?
Lending is prescribed in the Quran and Sunnah, and by scholarly consensus. 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“… and refuse al-ma'un (small kindnesses).” [Al-Ma’un 107:7] meaning, things that people exchange amongst themselves. Allah condemned those who withhold them from the people who need to borrow them. 
Those who believe it is obligatory to lend things quoted this verse as evidence, and this was the view chosen by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) in cases where the owner is rich. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) borrowed a horse in order to give it to Abu Talhah, and he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) borrowed some shields from Safwan ibn Umayyah. 
Lending something to a person who needs it is an act of worship which brings great reward, because it comes under the general heading of co-operating in righteousness and piety. 
Conditions of lending
For lending to be valid, it must meet four conditions: 

The one who is lending should be qualified to donate the item, because lending is a kind of donation; so it is not valid on the part of a minor, one who is insane, or a fool.  
The borrower should be qualified to receive the donation, so that if he accepts it that will be valid. 
The item lent should be something which it is Islamically permissible to benefit from. So it is not permissible to lend a Muslim slave to a non-Muslim , or to lend hunting equipment to a muhrim, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“… but do not help one another in sin and transgression…” [Al-Maidah 5:2]

The item lent should be something which can be used but will remain, as described above. 

What are the rules for lending?

The lender has the right to ask for the item back whenever he wants, unless asking for it back will cause some harm to the borrower, such as when he has borrowed a boat to convey his goods and it is still at sea, or if he asked him to let him use his wall to rest the ends of his wood on – he cannot ask him to give the wall back so long as the ends of his wood are still resting on it. 


The borrower has to take better care of the borrowed item than of his own possessions, so that he can return it in good condition to its owner, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“Verily, Allah commands that you should render back the trusts to those, to whom they are due” [Al-Nisa 4:58]
This verse indicates that it is obligatory to render back trusts, which includes items loaned. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Return trusts to those who entrusted you with them.” 
The texts indicate that it is obligatory to take care of things that have been entrusted to you, and that it is obligatory to return them to their owners in good condition. 
This general meaning includes items that are loaned, because the borrower is entrusted with them and is expected to return them. He is permitted to benefit from them within the limits dictated by custom, but he is not permitted to be extravagant in his use of them in such a way that he destroys them, or to use them in a way for which they were not designed to be used, because the owner did not give him permission to use them in that way, and Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Is there any reward for good other than good?” [Al-Rahman 55:60]

If the borrower uses it for something other than the purpose for which he borrowed it, and it is destroyed, then he is responsible for it, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The one who borrows is responsible for what he borrows until he returns it.” (Narrated by the five, and classed as sahih by al-Albani). This indicates that it is obligatory to return what one has taken of another person’s property, and that he is not free of responsibility until he has given it back to its owner or the owner’s deputy.
If it is destroyed whilst being used in the proper manner, the borrower is not to be held accountable for that, because the lender gave him permission to use it, and if that happens to an item that he has been permitted to use, then he is not to be held accountable for that. 

However, the scholars differed as to whether the borrower is held to be responsible for something that is destroyed whilst he was using it for a purpose other than that for which it was borrowed. One group said that he is to be held accountable for it whether he abused it or not, because of the general meaning of the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “The one who borrows is responsible for what he borrows until he returns it.”
This would apply in cases where an animal dies, a garment gets burned or a borrowed item is stolen. Another group said that he is not to be held accountable for it if he did not abuse it, because a person cannot be held accountable if he did not abuse it. Perhaps this view is more correct, because the borrower takes it with the permission of the owner, so it is a trust for him, like something with which one is entrusted. 

The borrower has to look after the loaned item, take care of it and hasten to return it to its owner when he no longer has any need for it. He should not be negligent concerning the item, or expose the item to the risk of destruction, because it is a trust and because the owner has done him a favour, and  

“Is there any reward for good other than good?” [Al-Rahman 55:60 – interpretation of the meaning].

21581,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21581,Ruling on reciting Quran and blowing into water,"Some people who recite ruqyah for those who are possessed or who suffer epilepsy recite Quran over water and blow into it, then they tell the sick person to wash with this water. What is the ruling on doing that?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Blowing into water is of two types: 
1 – If this is done with the intention of seeking barakah (blessing) from the saliva of the one who blows into it, this is undoubtedly haraam, because the saliva of any person is not a means of blessing and healing, and there is no one from whose relics blessing may be sought except Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Blessing cannot be sought from the relics of anyone else. Blessing was sought from the relics of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) during his life and after his death, if those relics remained. Umm Salaamah (may Allah be pleased with her) had a small bell-shaped vessel of silver in which she kept some hairs of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), from which the sick sought healing. If a sick person came to her she would pour some water over these hairs and stir it, then give it to the sick person. But apart from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), it is not permissible to seek blessing from the saliva of anyone, or from his sweat or his garment, etc. Rather this is haraam and is a kind of shirk. If the blowing into the water is done for the sake of seeking blessings from the saliva of the one who blows on it, then it is haraam and is a kind of shirk. That is because everyone who attributes an effect to something with no evidence from sharee’ah or proof in reality, has committed a kind of shirk, because he is making his blowing as a cause of healing alongside Allah, and proving that something is a cause of something else is to be based on shar’i evidence. Everyone who follows a means that Allah has not made to be a cause, either according to reality or sharee’ah, has committed a kind of shirk. 
2 – If a person blows with saliva after reciting Quran, such as al-Faatihah – which is a kind of ruqyah and is the greatest kind of ruqyah that may be recited over a sick person – so he recites al-Faatihah then blows into the water – there is nothing wrong with this. Some of the salaf did this, and it is effective and beneficial by Allah’s leave. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to blow into his hands when going to sleep, after reciting Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad, and Qul A’oodhu bi Rabbi’l-Falaq and Qul ‘A’oodhu bi Rabbi’l-Naas, then he would wipe his hands over his face and whatever he could of his body.

21582,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21582,Ruling on cloning of human beings,"What is the ruling on cloning of human beings? How does it affect lineage, marriage, inheritance and other rulings on family matters? May Allaah reward you with much good.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Allaah has created man in the best of forms, and bestowed upon him the greatest honours. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And indeed We have honoured the Children of Adam, and We have carried them on land and sea, and have provided them with At-Tayyibaat (lawful good things), and have preferred them above many of those whom We have created with a marked preferment”
[al-Israa’ 17:70]
Allaah has honoured him with reason and responsibility, and has made him a khaleefah on earth, to populate and develop it. He has honoured man by giving him the Message which suits his fitrah (natural state), indeed it is that fitrah itself, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So set you (O Muhammad) your face towards the religion (of pure Islamic Monotheism) Haneef (worship none but Allaah Alone). Allaah’s Fitrah (i.e. Allaah’s Islamic Monotheism) with which He has created mankind. No change let there be in Khalq-illaah (i.e. the religion of Allaah Islamic Monotheism), that is the straight religion, but most of men know not”
[al-Room 30:30]
Islam is keen to preserve the upright fitrah of man by preserving the five holistic aims: religion, life, reason, lineage and property, and protecting them from every change that may corrupt them, whether by its cause or its effects. This is stated in the hadeeth qudsi which was narrated by al-Qurtubi from the report of al-Qaadi Ismaa’eel, [in which Allaah says]: “I have created all My slaves as haneefs (pure monotheists), but the shayaateen (devils) come to them and try to divert them from their religion… and they commanded them to alter My creation.” (Tafseer al-Qurtubi, 5/389) 
Allaah taught man that which he did not know, and commanded him to seek and examine and think and ponder, as He says in many aayahs, such as the following (interpretations of the meanings): 
“Did they not see…”
[Ta-Ha 20:89, etc. 
“Do they not look at…”
[al-Ghaashiyah 88:17] 
“Does not man see that We have created him from Nutfah (mixed male and female sexual discharge semen drops)”
[Yaa-Seen 36:77 
“Verily, in these things, there are Ayaat (proofs, evidences, lessons, signs, etc.) for people who reflect”
[al-Ra’d 13:3] 
“Verily, therein is indeed a sign for people who have wisdom”
[al-Nahl 6:67] 
“Verily, in this is a Reminder for men of understanding”
[al-Zumar 39:1] 
“Read! In the Name of your Lord Who has created (all that exists
[al-‘Alaq 96:1]
Islam does not place any restrictions on the freedom of scientific research, or place any obstacles in its way, because it is a mean of understanding the laws of Allaah in His creation, but Islam also stipulates that this cannot be left without any guidelines or regulations on the introduction of scientific results into the public domain without first passing them through the sieve of sharee’ah, so that that which is permissible may be allowed through whilst that which is haraam is prevented from passing.  So it is not permissible to implement something simply because it can be implemented, rather it has to be beneficial knowledge which serves the interests of mankind and protects them from harm; this knowledge has to protect the dignity of man and the lofty purpose for which Allaah created him. So man should not become the subject of experimentation, and scientific research should not impinge upon the unique identity of the individual and his distinct characteristics, or lead to disruption of the social framework or dissolution of the foundations of kinship and lineage, or the family structure that has been known throughout human history in the shade of Allaah’s laws and on the solid foundation of His rulings. 
Among the new scientific discoveries that man has made in modern times is that which the media speaks of a great deal, that which is known as cloning. We have to explain the ruling of Islam on this matter, after quoting some details about it given by a group of Muslim scientists and experts in this field: 
Definition of cloning: 
It is known that the laws of Allaah concerning His creation dictate that the human being grows from the joining of two cells, the nucleus of each of which contains a number of chromosomes, half the number of chromosomes in the cells of the human body. When the cell of the father (the husband), which is called the sperm, joins with the cell of the mother (the wife), which is called the egg, they turn into a fertilized cell which contains the complete number of chromosomes, and has the potential to multiply. When it settles in the uterus of the mother, it grows and becomes a whole new created being, by the will of Allaah. This cell multiplies, so it becomes two identical cells, then four, then eight… then it continues to multiply until it reaches the stage where the cells start to differ from one another and become specialized. If, during the phase when the cells are multiplying but have not yet begun to specialize, one cell separates from the others, this will result in identical twins. Some experiments have been done in which cells were artificially separated from animal embryos, resulting in identical twins, but nothing of this sort has been reported regarding human beings. This is regarded as a kind of cloning, because it is producing identical copies, so it is called cloning by splitting. 
There is another way of cloning a complete creature, which is done by taking the complete number of chromosomes, in the form of a complete nucleus from one of the cells of the body, and inserting it into an egg cell from which the nucleus has been removed, thus forming a fertilized cell containing a complete number of chromosomes and at the same time able to multiply; if it is planted in the uterus of the mother it will develop and grow and be born as a complete creature, by the will of Allaah. This kind of cloning is known as nuclear transfer or nuclear insertion in the egg cell. This is what is understood by the word “cloning” when it is used, and this is what happened in the case of the sheep “Dolly”. But this new creature is not an exact copy of the original, because the egg of the mother from which the nucleus was removed still contains some remnants of the nucleus in the material surrounding the removed nucleus, and these remnants have a noticeable effect in altering the characteristics which are inherited from the body cells, and this also has not yet been reported to have been done with humans.  
So cloning means producing one or more living beings by transferring the nucleus of a body cell to an egg whose nucleus has been removed, or splitting an fertilized egg at the stage before the tissues and organs become distinct. 
It is obvious that these and similar procedures do not represent the act of creation, in whole or in part. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Or do they assign to Allaah partners who created the like of His creation, so that the creation (which they made and His creation) seemed alike to them?” Say: ‘Allaah is the Creator of all things; and He is the One, the Irresistible’”
[al-Ra’d 13:16]
“Then tell Me (about) the (human) semen that you emit.
Is it you who create it (i.e. make this semen into a perfect human being), or are We the Creator?
We have decreed death to you all, and We are not outstripped,
To transfigure you and create you in (forms) that you know not.
And indeed, you have already known the first form of creation (i.e. the creation of Adam), why then do you not remember (or take heed)?”
[al-Waaqi’ah 56:58-62] 
“Does not man see that We have created him from Nutfah (mixed male and female sexual discharge semen drops). Yet behold he (stands forth) as an open opponent.
And he puts forth for Us a parable, and forgets his own creation. He says: ‘Who will give life to these bones after they are rotten and have become dust?’
Say: (O Muhammad) ‘He will give life to them Who created them for the first time! And He is the All-Knower of every creation!’
He Who produces for you fire out of the green tree, when behold you kindle therewith.
Is not He Who created the heavens and the earth, Able to create the like of them? Yes, indeed! He is the All-Knowing Supreme Creator.
Verily, His Command, when He intends a thing, is only that He says to it, ‘Be!’ and it is!”
[Yaa-Seen 36:77-82]
“And indeed We created man (Adam) out of an extract of clay (water and earth).
Thereafter We made him (the offspring of Adam) as a Nutfah (mixed drops of the male and female sexual discharge and lodged it) in a safe lodging (womb of the woman).
Then We made the Nutfah into a clot (a piece of thick coagulated blood), then We made the clot into a little lump of flesh, then We made out of that little lump of flesh bones, then We clothed the bones with flesh, and then We brought it forth as another creation. So Blessed is Allaah, the Best of creators”
[al-Mu’minoon 23:12-14]
Based on the discussion above, the Committee has decided the following: 
(1)That human cloning using the two methods mentioned, or any other method that leads to reproduction of human beings is haraam
(2)If there is any transgression of the shar’i ruling mentioned above, then the consequences of that should be discussed to explain the shar’i rulings concerning such cases.
(3)All scenarios in which a third party may be added to the marital relationship are forbidden, whether that involves a womb (surrogacy), eggs, sperm or cells for cloning.
(4)It is permissible in Islam to use the technology of cloning and genetic engineering in cases of germs and microscopic creatures, plants and animals, within the limits and guidelines of sharee’ah, for the purpose of serving interests and warding off harm.","Majma’ al-Fiqh al-Islamiyyah, p. 216-220"

How a miscarriage in Ramadan affects a woman’s fast


Ruling on making up missed fasts by a pregnant woman","Praise be to Allah.This question covers three topics: 
1-The ruling on a pregnant woman breaking her fast in Ramadan
2-How a miscarriage in Ramadan affects a woman’s fast
3-The ruling on making up fasts after Ramadan
Fasting during pregnancy: Obligatory?
It is permissible for a pregnant woman not to fast if she fears some harm which she thinks will most likely affect her and/or her baby. Breaking the fast becomes obligatory if she fears that she may die or be severely harmed if she fasts. In that case, she has to make up the fast later on but she does not have to pay the fidyah. This is according to the consensus of the fuqaha, because Allah says (interpretation of the meanings): 
“And do not kill yourselves.” [al-Nisa 4:29] 
“and do not throw yourselves into destruction.” [al-Baqarah 2:195]
The scholars are similarly agreed that it is not obligatory to pay the fidyah in this case, because a woman in this case is like one who is sick and one who fears for his life. 
If the woman fears for her baby only (and not for herself), then some of the scholars are of the view that it is permissible for her to break her fast , but they say that she must make up the fast later on and pay the fidyah (which means feeding one poor person for each day not fasted), because of the report narrated from Ibn 'Abbas concerning the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And as for those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g. an old man), they have (a choice either to fast or) to feed a Miskin (poor person) (for every day).” [al-Baqarah 2:184]
Ibn 'Abbas said: 
“This is a concession allowed to old men and women, who can only fast with difficulty; they are allowed to break the fast and to feed one poor person for each day of fasting missed . This also applies to pregnant and nursing women, if they are afraid.” Abu Dawud said: “i.e., if they are afraid for their children, they may break the fast.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 1947; classed as sahih by al-Albani in al-Irwa, 4/18, 25) (See al-Mawsu’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 16/272) 
Hence it is clear that if fasting will cause great harm to a woman or to her baby, she is obliged to break the fast, on condition that the doctor who states that fasting will cause harm is a doctor who can be trusted. 
This has to do with breaking the fast during Ramadan. With regard to ‘Ashura , fasting on this day is not obligatory, according to scholarly consensus; rather it is mustahabb, and it is not permissible for a woman to observe a nafl fast when her husband is present, except with his permission. If he tells her not to fast then she has to obey him, especially if that is in the interests of the fetus. 
How a miscarriage in Ramadan affects a woman’s fast
With regard to miscarriage: “If the matter is as mentioned, that the miscarriage occurred in the third month of pregnancy , then the blood that comes out is not considered to be the blood of nifas (bleeding following childbirth), rather it is the blood of istihadah (non-menstrual vaginal bleeding), because what the woman passed was a clot (‘alaqah) in which there were no human features. On this basis, she should pray and fast even if she sees some blood, but she should do wudu for each prayer, and she has to make up the days when she did not fast and the prayers that she missed.” (See Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 10.218) 
Ruling on making up missed fasts by a pregnant woman
With regard to the fasts that a pregnant woman has missed: “Everyone who owes fasts from Ramadan has to make them up before the next Ramadan . They may delay that until Sha’ban. But if the next Ramadan comes and he has not made them up and had no excuse for that, then he is guilty of sin and he has to make them up as well as feeding one poor person for each day, as was stated by a number of the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The amount to be given is half a sa’ of the local staple food for each day, which may be given to a number of poor persons or to one. But if a person had an excuse for delaying making up the fasts, because he was sick or was traveling, then all he has to do is to make up the missed fasts, and he does not have to feed the poor, because of the general meaning of the verse (interpretation of the meaning):
‘but if any of you is ill or on a journey, the same number (should be made up) from other days.’ [al-Baqarah 2:184].
 And Allah is the Source of strength.”  (Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 15/340)

21592,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21592,Ruling on asking for a divorce from a husband who has some medical problems,"My husband and i been married for the last 11 years and we could not have childrens due to my husband who had a medical  problems whimhich he knew of  but had hide it from me before we got married and had i knew than i woulden,t have got married to him and my question is. 

I want to divorce him and wanted to know what are my right?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    If the problems to which you refer have to do with some 
    defect in your husband that discourages intimacy between you, or prevents 
    achievement of the purposes of marriage such as mercy and love, because he 
    is not able to have intercourse or he suffers from a sickness which prevents 
    him from being intimate, then the scholars count these things as faults in 
    the marriage which entitle the wife to have the choice: in other words, you 
    have the right to annul the marriage contract or to leave it as is, and he 
    does not have the right to take any part of the mahr from you, because you 
    gained the right to the mahr in return for the intimacy that he has had with 
    you in past years. 

    With regard to the man’s sterility, i.e., his inability to 
    father children, this is not counted as a fault that would necessitate 
    annulment of the marriage, according to the majority of scholars, apart from 
    the view of al-Hasan al-Basri, and Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah was also 
    inclined towards that view. 

    The husband should have explained his situation to his wife, 
    because the wife has the right to have children just as the husband does. 
    For this reason a husband is not permitted to practise ‘azl (coitus 
    interruptus) – which means ejaculating outside the vagina – without his 
    wife’s consent. 

    Ibn Qudaamah said, after listing the faults which give the 
    wife the option of annulling the marriage contract,  

    We do not know of any differing opinion among the scholars 
    concerning this matter, except that al-Hasan said: If one finds that the 
    other is sterile, there is the option of annulling the marriage. 

    Ahmad preferred that (the husband) should state his situation 
    and said: Perhaps his wife wants to have a child, and this should be 
    clarified at the beginning of the marriage. As for annulment, there is no 
    proof of that (in sharee’ah), otherwise it would apply in the case of women 
    when they reach menopause, and such a ruling is not known. For a man may not 
    have a child when he is young, then he may have a child when he is an old 
    man, or they may not have children at all.  

    With regard to other faults, according to the scholars it is 
    not proven that they are grounds for annulment. 

    (al-Mughni, 7/143) 

    On this basis, if you do not want to put up with him, then 
    either he should divorce you by talaaq according to sharee’ah, or you may 
    free yourself from him by khula’, whereby you agree to give him a certain 
    amount of money, or you return the mahr to him or whatever you agree upon, 
    whatever will be a suitable recompense in return for khula’, then he should 
    divorce you with a single talaaq. This talaaq will count as a revocable 
    divorce, and he will not have the right to take you back during the ‘iddah 
    or afterwards unless there is a new marriage contract that meets the 
    appropriate conditions. 

    The evidence that khula’ is permissible is the aayah 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “The divorce is twice, after that, either you retain her on 
    reasonable terms or release her with kindness. And it is not lawful for you 
    (men) to take back (from your wives) any of your Mahr (bridal-money given by 
    the husband to his wife at the time of marriage) which you have given them, 
    except when both parties fear that they would be unable to keep the limits 
    ordained by Allaah (e.g. to deal with each other on a fair basis). Then if 
    you fear that they would not be able to keep the limits ordained by Allaah, 
    then there is no sin on either of them if she gives back (the Mahr or a part 
    of it) for her Al-Khul‘ (divorce). These are the limits ordained by Allaah, 
    so do not transgress them. And whoever transgresses the limits ordained by 
    Allaah, then such are the Zaalimoon (wrongdoers)” 
    [al-Baqarah 2:229] 

    The evidence from the Sunnah is the hadeeth narrated by al-Bukhaari 
    in his Saheeh (4867) from Ibn ‘Abbaas, in which it says that the wife 
    of Thaabit ibn Qays came to the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said, “O Messenger of Allaah, I do not 
    blame Thaabit ibn Qays for any defect in his character or his religious 
    commitment, but I would hate to commit an act of kufr when I am a Muslim.” 
    The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said, “Will you give him back his garden [which he had given as mahr]?” She 
    said, “Yes.” The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said (to Thaabit), “Accept the garden, and divorce her once.” 

    The scholars are agreed that khula’ is permissible if there 
    is a shar’i reason for it. For more information on the reasons, please see 
    question no. 1859. 

    We must advise you that if your husband’s character and 
    religious commitment are good, and there is no risk of you falling into 
    haraam things if you remain married to him, then it is better for you to be 
    patient and stay with your husband; perhaps Allaah will grant you from him 
    sons and daughters who will be the apple of your eye. 

    And Allaah knows best what is right.

    If what is meant is taking pictures of the deceased whilst he

    and he cursed the image-makers and said that “they will be the most severely 
    punished of the people on the Day of Resurrection.” 

    But if what the questioner means is in order to explain how 
    to wash the deceased in the manner prescribed by Allaah on a video cassette

    that, just as recordings may be made to teach people how to pray and other

    There is no problem that cannot by solved by anyone, as 
    stated in the question. For every problem there is a solution, but the 
    problem is not in finding the solution, rather it depends on the one who is 
    going to implement the solution. Many of those who go through difficult 
    circumstances and ask for a solution imagine that the person they are asking 
    is able to take away the problem, but this is not correct. Rather all that a 
    human being can do is to suggest the best possible ways of reaching the 
    desired result, but the person must still make the effort to solve his 
    problem – this is very important and essential. 

    With regard to what you asked about: 

    Firstly: 

    This dislike that they are showing may be based on incorrect 
    ideas about you, so perhaps it is only temporary and may disappear if you 
    try hard to be pleasant to them. I say this because we cannot be sure of 
    what may happen in the future. How often has a girl have been disliked by 
    her husband’s family in the beginning, then as they got to know her and saw 
    her good manners and good attitude, they changed their minds about her and 
    their condemnation turned to praise and their hatred to love. So do not 
    worry about what may happen, just be cheerful and optimistic about your 
    future with your husband. 

    Secondly: 

    You must show your best attitude towards your husband’s 
    family, who have the right to be treated in a good manner by you because 
    they are the family of your husband. Pay a great deal of attention to his 
    parents, and take care of his mother as if she were your own mother. If she 
    comes to your house, try to meet her with a friendly and smiling face, and 
    do not pay too much attention to your husband whilst she is there with you, 
    because this may stir up feelings of jealousy, which are very strong in 
    human beings. 

    Thirdly: 

    Turn to Allaah and make du’aa’, and ask Him to help you to 
    treat them well and to soften their hearts and make them love you. Realize 
    that no matter how hard you look for a solution, help is ultimately in His 
    hand. So turn to Him with all sincerity. May Allaah send blessings and peace 
    upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon his family.",Islam Q&A

These are means that lead to evil and corruption. 
Any Muslim woman who has done such a thing has to repent sincerely from that, and not go back to such evil deeds.
