Then he travelled towards east and reached his home country. The next day in his home country still the Ramdaan month is going on. Whether he has to observe fast again according to the home land or since he fast whole Ramdaan before his travel, no need to continue fast along with the local people of his home land.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about a man who fasts twenty-nine days and attends Eid on the thirtieth day in the country where he was fasting, then on the morning of Eid he travels to another country when he is not fasting, but he finds the people there fasting. Should he fast or should he continue not fasting and regarding that day as Eid? 
He replied: You do not have to refrain from eating and drinking, because you broke your fast in a legitimate manner. So in your case it is a day when you are permitted to eat and drink, and you do not have to refrain from that. If you could not see the sun in one country then you traveled to another country where you could see the sun before it set, then you do not have to fast that day.  
And he was asked: if we start fasting in Saudi Arabia, then we travel to our homelands in eastern Asia during the month of Ramadaan where the hijri month comes a day later, should we fast thirty-one days, and if they fast twenty-nine days should we break our fast or not? 
He replied: If a person travels from a country where he fasted at the beginning of the month to a country where Eid al-Fitr comes later, he should continue his fast and not break his fast until they do. This is like the case where a person travels from his city to a place where sunset comes later; he should continue his fast until the sun sets even if that takes twenty hours, unless he breaks his fast because of traveling, as he is entitled to do. The opposite also applies, such as if he were to travel to a place where they have stopped fasting before he has completed thirty days – he should break the fast with them, and if the month was thirty days he should make up a day, and if it was twenty-nine days he does not have to do anything. He should make it up if he did less than a month, and if he did more than a month then he did more. And Allah knows best.

I kissed her and spent a lot of time in the hospital sitting with her and pursuaded her that, In sha Allah, she will be alright and I spent nearly 15,000 S.R towards medical expenses but she died. Q:1) Did she die because I was not talking to her on the telephone and she took this matter seriously in her heart ? Q:2) My mother-in-law blames me for the cause of her daughter's heart because I was not sending sufficient money for her because my mother wants my wife to stay in our home rather than staying with her parents. My mother told me that if I send money she will not come back to our house, so I used to send only a little money. Could that be the cause of my wife's dealth as my mother-in-law said ? Please help me and I feel very much guilty upon hearing my mother-in-law's words as I can not sleep properly and am feeling quilty. It was a love marriage and we quarreled on small issues sometimes, but I never wanted her death.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: wWe ask Allah to shower your wife with His mercy and 
    to record for her the reward of martyrdom, because the Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Martyrdom is of seven types 
    besides being killed (in jihad) for the sake of Allah,” ...and among them he 
    mentioned the woman who dies because of pregnancy or childbirth. Narrated by 
    Abu Dawood, 3111; al-Nasai, 1846; classed as saheeh by al-Albani. And we 
    ask Him to help you and her family to bear this loss with patience and to 
    compensate you in this world and in the Hereafter. 

    Secondly: There is no doubt that life and death are in the 
    hand of Allah and that the time of death and life-spans are decreed by His 
    will. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Who has created death and life that He may test you which 
    of you is best in deed”

    [al-Mulk 67:2] 

    “La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped 
    but He). It is He Who gives life and causes death”

    [al-A’raf 7:158] 

    No one has the power to benefit or harm another except by 
    Allah’s leave. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) 
    said: “The Holy Spirit inspired to me that no soul will ever depart this 
    world until it has completed its allotted time and used up its allotted 
    provision, so do not be too desperate when seeking provision. If you feel 
    that provision is slow in coming, do not try to hasten it by disobeying 
    Allah, for that which is with Allah can only be attained by obeying Him.” 
    Narrated by al-Tabarani, 8/166; classed as hasan by al-Albani). 

    Thirdly: Islam enjoins kindness. The Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has prescribed kindness in 
    all one’s affairs.” Narrated by Muslim, 1955. The Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) even spoke of a woman who went to Hell 
    because of a cat that she detained until it died. Narrated by al-Bukhari, 
    2365; Muslim, 2242. 

    To what degree then do you think Islam enjoins kindness 
    towards one's wife– one’s companion in this world and in the Hereafter?  

    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) 
    said: “I urge you to treat women kindly.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3331; 
    Muslim, 1468. 

    Al-Imam al-Tirmidhi narrated a hadeeth (1163) which he classed 
    as hasan, and al-Albani agreed with him, according to which the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, during the Farewell 
    Pilgrimage: “They (women) are like prisoners in your hands.” 

    It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with 
    him) that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: 
    “The most complete in faith of the believers are those who have the best 
    attitude, and the best of you are those who are best towards their 
    womenfolk.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1162; classed as hasan by al-Albani. 

    Fourthly: If you know from the above that you fell short in 
    your duty towards your wife, by cutting off communication with her when she 
    was sick and was most in need of you, and the quarrel between you was about 
    some minor issue, as you mention, then how could you fall short in spending 
    on her, for spending on one’s wife is obligatory according to the Quran 
    and Sunnah, and scholarly consensus, as it says in al-Mughni (9/229)? 
    If your mother told you to do something other than that, you should not have 
    obeyed her, because there is no obedience to any created being if it 
    involves disobedience towards the Creator. Your feelings of shortcoming and 
    sin are appropriate. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allah be upon 
    him) said: “Righteousness is a good attitude, and wrongdoing is that which 
    wavers in your heart and which you dislike people finding out about.” 
    Narrated by Muslim, 2553. 

    But this sin should not be regarded as the cause of your 
    wife’s death, because it is not directly connected to it and such things do 
    not usually kill a person. You mentioned in your question that she died 
    because of complications in pregnancy. And you did well – may Allah reward 
    you with good – by sitting with her in her last days and spending on her. 
    Your doing these things will be an expiation for you in sha Allah. 

    Our advice to you is to pray a great deal for forgiveness for yourself and for her, and make du’a for her, give in charity on her behalf, honour her family and uphold your ties with them and treat them kindly; put up with any bad treatment you may encounter from them because of the loss of their daughter; and let what happened be a lesson for the future so that it does not happen again.

What is the ruling on this situation? Can I do all the prayers after work?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Delaying the prayer until after the time when it is due, with no valid excuse, is 
    a major sin. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So woe unto those performers of Salaah (prayers) (hypocrites),
Those who delay their Salaah (prayer from their stated fixed times)”
[al-Ma’oon 107:4-5]
Sa’d ibn Abi Waqqaas was asked whether delaying prayer is counted as abandoning 
    prayer. He said, “No, but it means delaying it until after its time.”  
Ibn ‘Abbaas said: “ ‘Those who delay their Salaah’ means those who delay it until 
    after its time.” 
Tafseer al-Qurtubi, 12/706. 
Work is not a reason for not praying until the time for prayer is over. Allaah 
    says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“In houses (mosques) which Allaah has ordered to be raised (to be cleaned, and 
    to be honoured), in them His Name is remembered [i.e. Adhaan, Iqaamah, Salaah (prayers), invocations, recitation of the Qur’aan]. Therein glorify 
    Him (Allaah) in the mornings and in the afternoons or the evenings,
Men whom neither trade nor sale (business) diverts from the remembrance of Allaah (with heart 
    and tongue) nor from performing AsSalaah (Iqaamat asSalaah) nor from giving the Zakaah. They fear a Day when hearts and eyes will be overturned 
    (out of the horror of the torment of the Day of Resurrection)”
[al-Noor 24:36-37]
al-Sa’di said: 
These men, even though they engage in trade and buy and sell, that does not distract them from 
    remembering Allaah and establishing regular prayer and praying zakaah. Rather they make obedience and worship of Allaah their main aim and 
    ultimate goal, and whatever comes between them and that goal, they shun it. 
Based on this, you should either ask your boss to allow you enough time to pray on 
    time, or you should leave this job which is keeping you from prayer. And whoever gives up something for the sake of Allaah, Allaah will compensate 
    him with something better than that.

But if it is done just to be friendly towards them and enjoy their company, this is a dangerous matter, because the principle of al-wala’ wa’l-bara’ (befriending the believers and showing enmity towards the disbelievers) is one of the basic principles of Islam, and one of the most important duties of the believers. This principle is referred to in a number of verses in the Book of Allaah and ahaadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), for example: 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“You (O Muhammad) will not find any people who believe in Allaah and the Last Day, making friendship with those who oppose Allaah and His Messenger (Muhammad), even though they were their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kindred (people).

Until now he never breaks the fast with me at home. He breaks it in the masjid and he did not show up until 10P.M. Do you think this is an islamic act? Please I want an answer especially I am new muslim but my husband is a muslim born and he told me this is the rule of islam and I do not think that Islam states that?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Undoubtedly kind treatment of a wife includes the husband 
    taking care of his wife’s needs, both spiritual and worldly, and doing his 
    duties towards her. One of the first duties of a husband towards his wife is 
    to teach her about her religion and ‘aqeedah (beliefs) as Allaah has 
    enjoined. Undoubtedly your husband’s telling you that what he is doing is 
    what Islam teaches is not correct. This is a kind of speaking about Allaah 
    without knowledge, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him), even though he had his companions and was concerned about 
    their affairs and meeting their needs, was nevertheless at his family’s 
    service and took care of them. It was narrated that Aswad said: I asked 
    ‘Aa’ishah what the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    used to do in his house. She said: “He used to be at his family’s service 
    and when the time for prayer came, he would go out and attend the prayer.” 
    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 644.  

    And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “and live with them honourably”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:19]
This indicates that kind 
    and honourable treatment is the basis of married life as enjoined by 
    Allaah. 

    It is well known that breaking the fast with one's wife, even 
    if that is only on some days, is a kind of treating her kindly, especially 
    at the beginning of marriage, when sharee’ah calls for everything that will 
    help to strengthen the marriage, especially if the wife feels lonely. It is 
    also an opportunity to teach her in a practical manner some of the Sunnahs 
    and etiquette of breaking the fast. 

    Based on the above, we suggest that the husband should take 
    care of his home and family, and look after them, and not fall short in his 
    duties towards them. He should understand that he will be rewarded for 
    taking care of his family’s affairs, more than taking care of others who are 
    not members of his family. Hence the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “Charity given to a poor person is charity, but 
    charity given to a relative is two things: charity and upholding the ties of 
    kinship.” Narrated by al-Nasaa’i, no. 2528; classed as saheeh by 
    al-Albaani. 
And the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Begin with those who 
    are your dependents.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1360; Muslim, 1034. This does 
    not mean that he is Islamically obliged to break the fast with his wife 
    every day, but undoubtedly it is an act of kindness towards his wife and 
    family to keep them company and reduce their loneliness, and to be with they 
    when they need him in some of their affairs, especially since the questioner 
    says that she is tired because of pregnancy. It is also an act of kindness 
    towards one’s wife and family to be gentle and kind to them, to keep them 
    company and to look after them. It is not an act of kindness to do as some 
    men do, spending the evenings in the company of their friends and not caring 
    about their families or wives. We ask Allaah to set the affairs of the 
    Muslims straight. And Allaah knows best.",Islam Q&A

What Quran says about prohibition of alcohol


What hadith says about prohibition of alcohol?","Praise be to Allah.Is drinking alcohol a major sin?
Drinking alcohol is a major sin, for wine is the mother of all evils. It clouds the mind, wastes money, causes headaches, tastes foul, and is an abomination of the Shaytan’s [Satan’s] handiwork. 
It creates enmity and hatred between people, prevents them from remembering Allah and praying, calls them to zina [unlawful sexual relationships], and may even call them to commit incest with their daughters, sisters or other female relatives. It takes away pride and protective jealousy (ghirah), and generates shame, regret and disgrace, and puts the drinker in the same category as the most imperfect type of people, namely those who are insane. It leads to the disclosure of secrets and exposure of faults. It encourages people to commit sins and evil actions. It makes people transgress sacred limits and the one who is addicted to it is like an idol-worshipper. 
How many wars has it started, how many rich men has it made poor, how many noble people has it brought low, how many blessings has it destroyed, how many disasters has it caused? 
How often has it created division between man and wife?  
How much regret has it generated and how many tears has it caused to flow? 
How often has it closed the doors of goodness to the drinker and opened the doors of evil to him? 
How often has it brought about calamity and hastened death? 
How much trouble has it brought to the one who drinks it? 
It is the source of sin, the key to evil; it takes away blessings and brings calamity. 
Even if it did not have all these evil consequences, the fact that one cannot have both the wine of this world and the wine of Paradise is a sufficient deterrent. 
And the evil consequences of alcohol are many times more than we have mentioned. (From the words of Ibn al-Qayyim in Hadi al-Arwah) 
What Quran says about prohibition of alcohol
Allah has warned us against it in His Book and on the lips of His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).  

Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“O you who believe! Intoxicants (all kinds of alcoholic drinks), and gambling, and Al-Ansab (stone altars for sacrifices to idols, jinn, etc), and Al-Azlam (arrows for seeking luck or decision) are an abomination of Shaytan’s (Satan’s) handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) in order that you may be successful.” [Al-Maidah 5:90]
What hadith says about prohibition of alcohol?

Allah has cursed the drinker of alcohol. In Sunan Abi Dawud (3189) it is narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has cursed alcohol, the one who drinks it, the one who pours it, the one who sells it, the one who buys it , the one squeezes (the grapes, etc), the one for whom it is squeezed, the one who carries it and the one to whom it is carried.” (Classed as sahih by al-Albani as stated in Sahih Abi Dawud, 2/700.) 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) likened the one who is addicted to alcohol to one who worships idols. 
It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The one who is addicted to alcohol is like one who worships an idol.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah, 3375; classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah, 2720) 
The one who is addicted to alcohol will be denied admission to Paradise. It was narrated from Abu’l-Darda that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No one who is addicted to alcohol will enter Paradise.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah, 3376; classed as sahih by al-Albani as stated in Sahih Ibn Majah, 2721) 
It was narrated that ‘Uthman (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Avoid alcohol for it is the mother of all evils. There was a man among the people who came before you who was a devoted worshipper. A seductive woman fell in love with him, and she sent her slave-woman to him to call him to bear witness. He went with the slave-woman, and every time they passed through a door, she locked it behind them, until he reached a beautiful woman with whom was a child and a vessel of wine. She said, ‘I did not call you to bear witness, rather I called you either to have intercourse with me, or to drink a cup of this wine, or to kill this child.’ He said, ‘Pour me some of this wine.’ So she poured him a cup, then he said, ‘Give me more,’ and he did not stop until he had intercourse with her and killed the child. So avoid alcohol, for by Allah faith and addiction to wine cannot be combined except soon one of them will be expelled.” (Narrated by al-Nasai, 5666; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Nasai, 5236) 


His prayers will not be accepted for forty days . It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever drinks alcohol and gets drunk, his prayers will not be accepted for forty days, and if he dies he will go to Hell, but if he repents, Allah will accept his repentance. If he drinks wine again and gets drunk, his prayer will not be accepted for forty days, and if he dies he will go to Hell, but if he repents, Allah will accept his repentance. If he drinks wine again and gets drunk, his prayer will not be accepted for forty days, and if he dies he will go to Hell, but if he repents, Allah will accept his repentance. If he does that again, Allah will give him to drink of the mud of khabal on the Day of Resurrection.” They said, “O Messenger of Allah, what is the mud of khabal?” He said, “The juice of the people of Hell.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah, 3377; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah, 2722) 

The fact that his prayers are not accepted does not mean that the person’s prayers are invalid, or that he should give up prayer. Rather what it means is that he will not be rewarded for them. So the purpose of his prayer is to fulfil his duty and to avoid the punishment for not praying. 
Abu ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mandah said: 
“The phrase “his prayers will not be accepted” means that he will not be rewarded for his prayers for forty days, as a punishment for drinking alcohol . This is like what they said about the one who speaks when the imam is delivering the khutbah on Friday: he prays Jumu’ah [Friday prayer] but there is no Jumu’ah for him, meaning that he will not be given the reward for praying Jumu`ah, as a punishment for his sin.” (Ta’zim Qadr al-Salah, 2/587, 588) 
Al-Nawawi said: 
“With regard to his prayer not being accepted, what this means is that he will not be rewarded for it, even though it is valid, and he does not have to repeat it. 
With regard to what the questioner was told about her fasting not being accepted, this is based on the view of some of the scholars that the mention of prayer in the hadith quoted above is a warning that no other acts of worship will be accepted either. 
Al-Mubarakfuri said in Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi: 
It is said that prayer was singled out for mention because it is the best physical act of worship, and if it is not accepted, it is more likely that other acts of worship will not be accepted either. 
Al-‘Iraqi and al-Manawi also said something similar. 
Based on this view, fasting is not accepted either, but this does not mean that the person who drank alcohol should not fast, rather he is enjoined to fast, but it will not be accepted from him, as a rebuke. 
Undoubtedly the person who drinks alcohol should still offer the prayers on time, and fast in Ramadan. If he omits some of his prayer or fasting, he will be committing a major sin that is even greater than the sin of drinking alcohol . 
It should be noted that if a Muslim commits sin and is unable to repent because of his weakness of faith, that should not be used to justify his persisting in sin or his addiction, or his neglecting to do acts of worship. Rather he has to do whatever he can of acts of worship and strive to give up the sins that he is committing. 
The Muslim has to fear Allah and beware of the wiles and snares of the Shaytan [Satan]. He should not let his soul become a plaything of the Shaytan. If his Shaytan overpowers him and makes him fall into sin and disobedience towards his Creator, then he must hasten to repent, for “the one who repents is like the one who did not sin.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah, 2450; classed as sahih by al-Busayri as stated in al-Zawaid Hashiyat Sunan Ibn Majah) 
This punishment for the one who drinks alcohol applies to the one who does not repent. As for the one who repents and turns to Allah, Allah will accept his repentance and accept his good deeds. 
We ask Allah to protect us from the tricks of the Shaytan and to help us avoid temptations both obvious and hidden.

He has to repent to Allah from this sin, refrain from eating and drinking for the rest of the day, and make up for that day’s fast later on.","Is touching non-mahram women haram?


Does shaking hands with women break your fast?


Ruling on emission of semen while fasting


Scenarios of emission of semen by desire","Praise be to Allah.Is touching non-mahram women haram?
The ruling on touching non-mahram women is that it is haram, during Ramadan and at other times, whether that is touching with the hand only or actions that are more serious than that. Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If one of you were to be stabbed in the head with an iron needle, that would be better for him than his touching a woman who is not permissible for him.” (Narrated by al-Tabarani in al-Kabeer, 486; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami’, 5045.) 
Sins in general – including touching (non-mahram) women – are more serious in Ramadan. They detract from the reward of fasting , and may even spoil the fast altogether so that the fasting person gets nothing from his fast except hunger and thirst. Hence the fasting person is told most emphatically to avoid sin.  
The believer should make the most of Ramadan to set himself straight, to repent from sin and to turn to Allah . The day when he fasts and the day when he does not fast cannot be the same. 
Jabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: When you fast, then let your hearing, sight and tongue fast and abstain from lies and haram things, and refrain from harming your neighbour. Be tranquil and dignified on the day when you fast, and do not let the day when you fast and the day when you do not fast be the same. (Narrated by Ibn al-Mubarak in al-Zuhd, 1308) 
Does shaking hands with women break your fast?
If a man shakes hands with a woman during the day in Ramadan, and he ejaculates, his fast is invalidated, and there is no difference of opinion among the scholars on this point. He has to repent to Allah from this sin, refrain from eating and drinking for the rest of the day, and make up for that day’s fast later on. (See al-Mughni by Ibn Qudamah, 4/361) 
Ruling on emission of semen while fasting
With regard to emission of semen whilst fasting, if that happens without desire , e.g. because of sickness, then it does not affect the fast. 
The Standing Committee was asked: 
I suffer from seminal discharge during the days in Ramadan without any wet dreams or engaging in the “secret habit” (masturbation).  Does this have any effect on the fast? 
They replied: 
“If the matter is as described, the emission of semen without any feelings of pleasure during the day in Ramadan does not affect your fast, and you do not have to make up that day.” (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 10/278) 
Scenarios of emission of semen by desire
But if the emission of semen is accompanied by desire, one of two scenarios applies: 

That happens because the man does something that provokes his desires, such as kissing his wife, shaking hands with a woman with desire, etc. This invalidates the fast and he must make up that day later on. 
The semen is emitted without the man doing anything, such as simply thinking about desire, or because of a wet dream. This does not invalidate the fast and his fast is still valid. 

Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“With regard to the emission of semen as the result of desire, this invalidates the fast whether that happened because of touching or kissing or repeatedly looking, or any other reason that provokes desire, such as masturbation etc. With regard to wet dreams and thinking, these do not invalidate the fast even is semen is emitted as a result.” (Fatawa Islamiyyah, 2/135) 
And Allah knows best.",Islam Q&A
38161,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/38161,A Christian is asking what is written on the gate of Paradise?,What is written on the gates of paradise?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    Paradise does not have only one gate, rather it has many 
    gates. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And those who kept their duty to their Lord (Al-Muttaqoon 
    – the pious) will be led to Paradise in groups till when they reach it, and 
    its gates will be opened (before their arrival for their reception) and its 
    keepers will say: Salaamun ‘Alaykum (peace be upon you)! You have done well, 
    so enter here to abide therein”

    [al-Zumar 39:73]
There is also evidence 
    narrated in the Sunnah which points to the number of these gates. For 
    example, the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “In Paradise there are eight gates, among which is a gate called al-Rayyaan, 
    through which no one will enter except those who fast.” Narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari, 3257; Muslim, 1125. This hadeeth indicates that the number of 
    gates is eight. 

    Secondly: 

    There are some reports which speak of what is written on the 
    gate of Paradise. The strongest report that we have found is that which was 
    narrated by al-Tabaraani and al-Bayhaqi from Abu Umaamah (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him), that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “A man entered Paradise and saw written on its gate ‘Charity 
    receives a tenfold reward and a loan an eighteenfold reward.’” 

    Classed as hasan by al-Albaani. See Saheeh al-Targheeb 
    wa’l-Tarheeb, 1/537. 
Although some scholars 
    were inclined to accept the attribution of this hadeeth to the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), others – including Ibn 
    al-Jawzi, al-‘Iraaqi, al-Manaawi and others – classed it as da’eef (weak), 
    because the narrators who transmitted it from the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) include a narrator who is very weak. 

    There is another report which says: “Written on the gates of 
    Paradise is: ‘Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah Muhammad Rasool-Allaah ‘Ali akhoo 
    rasool-Illaah (There is no god but Allaah, Muhammad is the Messenger of 
    Allaah, ‘Ali is the brother of the Messenger of Allaah).’ This was written 
    two thousand years before the creation of the heavens and the earth.” 

    But this is a false report which cannot be attributed to the 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). See 
    al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah, vol. 10, no. 4901. 
We should also note that 
    speaking about this topic or similar topics that have to do with Paradise, 
    Hell or other matters of the unseen cannot be accepted as correct unless it 
    is based on revelation (wahy) that is proven to be from Allaah, on the lips 
    of His Messenger. 

    And we have to ask ourselves: what is the practical benefit 
    of knowing such things? What good things will we be missing out on if we do 
    not know this? 

    The question which we should really be asking is: How can we 
    get to those gates? How can they be opened for us? How can we enter them? 

    This is the decisive question which people should concern 
    themselves with. 

    In truth there is only one way to reach Paradise: the 
    straight path in which there is no crookedness. Allaah says (interpretation 
    of the meaning): 

    “And verily, this is My straight path, so follow it, and 
    follow not (other) paths, for they will separate you away from His path. 
    This He has ordained for you that you may become Al‑Muttaqoon (the pious)”

    [al-An’aam 6:153]

    The first step on that straight path is believing that there 
    is no god but Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah, believing 
    that Muhammad  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is a Prophet 
    and Messenger from Allaah. This is the matter concerning which Allaah took 
    the covenant and pledge from the Prophets before they were sent. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning):  
“And (remember) when 
    Allaah took the Covenant of the Prophets, saying: ‘Take whatever I gave you 
    from the Book and Hikmah (understanding of the Laws of Allaah), and 
    afterwards there will come to you a Messenger (Muhammad) confirming what is 
    with you; you must, then, believe in him and help him.’ Allaah said: ‘Do you 
    agree (to it) and will you take up My Covenant (which I conclude with you)?’ 
    They said: ‘We agree.’ He said: ‘Then bear witness; and I am with you among 
    the witnesses (for this).’”

    [Aal ‘Imraan 3:81]

    Allaah called all of those who were given a book before him 
    to believe in this final Prophet and His plain Book. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O people of the 
    Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Now has come to you Our Messenger 
    (Muhammad) explaining to you much of that which you used to hide from the 
    Scripture and pass over (i.e. leaving out without explaining) much. Indeed, 
    there has come to you from Allaah a light (Prophet Muhammad) and a plain 
    Book (this Qur’aan). 
16. Wherewith Allaah 
    guides all those who seek His Good Pleasure to ways of peace, and He brings 
    them out of darkness by His Will unto light and guides them to the Straight 
    Way (Islamic Monotheism)”
[al-Maa'idah 5:15-16] 

    Allaah tells us that His proof is established against the 
    People of the Book and others by means of this final Prophet. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O people of the 
    Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Now has come to you Our Messenger 
    (Muhammad) making (things) clear unto you, after a break in (the series of) 
    Messengers, lest you say: ‘There came unto us no bringer of glad tidings and 
    no warner.’ But now has come unto you a bringer of glad tidings and a 
    warner. And Allaah is Able to do all things”
[al-Maa’idah 5:19] 

    After he has come, no one can enter Paradise unless they 
    follow him and obey him. 

    It was narrated that Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) said: Some angels came to the Prophet while he wassleeping. Some of them said, “He is sleeping.” Otherssaid, “His eyes are sleeping but his heart is awake.” Then they said, 
    “There is an example for this companionof yours.” 
    One of them said, “Then set forth an examplefor 
    him.” Some of them said, “He is sleeping.” Theothers 
    said, “His eyes are sleeping but his heart is awake.” Then they said, “His 
    example is that of a manwho has built a house and 
    then offered therein abanquet and sent a messenger 
    to invite thepeople. So whoever accepted the 
    invitation of themessenger, entered the house and 
    ate of the banquet, andwhoever did not accept the 
    invitation of the messenger, didnot enter the house, 
    nor did he eat of the banquet.” Then the angels 
    said, “Explain this example to him sothat he may 
    understand it.” Some of them said, “He issleeping.” 
    The others said, “His eyes are sleeping buthis heart 
    is awake.” And then they said, ""Thehouse stands for 
    Paradise and the caller isMuhammad; and whoever 
    obeys Muhammad, obeysAllaah; and whoever disobeys 
    Muhammad, disobeysAllaah. Muhammad separated the 
    people (i.e., throughhis message, the good are 
    distinguished from the badand the believers from the 
    disbelievers).”  

    Saheeh al-Bukhaari, 2861. 

    According to a report narrated by al-Daarimi: Rabee’ah 
    al-Jurashi said: Some (angels) came to the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) and it was said to him: “Let your eyes sleep and let 
    your ears hear and let your heart understand.” He said: “My eyes slept but 
    my ears heard and my heart understood.” He said: “It was said to me: A 
    master built a house, then he prepared a banquet and sent a caller (to 
    invite people). Whoever responded to the caller entered the house and ate of 
    the banquet and the master was pleased with him, and whoever did not respond 
    to the caller did not enter the house or eat of the banquet, and the master 
    was angry with him.” Allaah is the master, Muhammad is the caller, the house 
    is Islam and the banquet is Paradise.”

38162,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/38162,Is there a difference in the way men and women prostrate?,Is there a difference in the way men and women prostrate?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Some of the scholars are of the view that men and woman 
    should pray differently, and they quote a number of ahaadeeth as evidence 
    for that, but these are all da’eef (weak) and cannot be taken as evidence. 

    See the answer to question no.
    9276.  

    But the correct view is that there is no difference in the 
    way men and women pray. 

    Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen said, refuting the view of the 
    fuqaha’ that “women should not spread their arms out, rather they should 
    keep them close to their sides and when they prostrate they should press 
    their stomachs to their thighs and their thighs to their calves… because 
    they should conceal themselves, and compressing themselves is more 
    concealing than spreading out.” Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on 
    him) said: 

    This may be answered in several ways: 

    1 – This reason cannot stand up against the general meaning 
    of the texts which indicate that women are like men with regard to rulings, 
    especially since the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said: “Pray as you have seen me praying,” and this is addressed in 
    general terms, including both men and women. 

    2 – This reason is redundant because usually, as is 
    prescribed, women pray alone in their houses with no men present. In that 
    case there is no need for them to compress themselves, so long as no men can 
    see them. 

    3 – You say that she raises her hands, and raising the hands 
    is more likely to uncover than spreading the arms when prostrating. But 
    despite that you say that it is Sunnah for her to raise her hands, because 
    the basic principle is that the rulings apply equally to men and women. 

    The correct view is: 
Women should do the same 
    things that men do in the prayer, so they should raise their hands and 
    spread their arms out when prostrating, and make their backs level when 
    bowing and lift their stomachs up off their thighs, and their thighs up off 
    their calves, when prostrating… they should sit on the left foot with the 
    right foot held upright when sitting between the two prostrations and in the 
    first tashahhud. In the last tashahhud of the prayer there is only one 
    tashahhud, and they should sit mutawarrikan (with the left upper thigh on 
    the ground and both feet protruding from one (the right) side) during the 
    final tashahhud of three- and four-rak’ah prayers. 

    There are no exceptions for women in any of these matters. 

    Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 3/304, 303 

    Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, at the 
    end of his book Sifat Salaat al-Nabi  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) (The Prophet’s Prayer Described): 

    “All that has been mentioned of the description of the 
    Prophet's prayer  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) applies 
    equally to men and women, for there is nothing in the Sunnah to necessitate 
    the exception of women from any of these descriptions; in fact, the 
    generality of his statement  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him), ‘Pray as you have seen me praying’, includes women” 

    If we assume that a woman is praying in a public place where men may see her, such as in the Haram in Makkah, or in a park – if she has to pray there – then she should be careful with regard to every action that may lead to uncovering any part of her, and take extra precautions in this case.

38164,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/38164,"He owes a debt to someone, can he go for jihad?","If one does not immediately have the money to travel abroad and remains in debt to another muslim, is it still prudent to travel for jihad? if that person gains some money in a time necessitating jihad should that person first repay his debt or can he use the money for jihad?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: if jihad is fard ‘ayn (an individual obligation), as 
    in the circumstances that are explained in sharee’ah, then whoever owes a 
    debt should go out for jihad and he does not have to seek permission from 
    the person to whom he owes that debt. 

    If the jihad is fard kifaayah (a communal obligation) such as 
    offensive jihad, then it is not permissible to go out except with the 
    permission of the person to whom he owes that debt; if he gives him 
    permission then he may go out, otherwise he should not, unless he leaves 
    enough to pay off the debt or leaves something in pledge with him or he asks 
    someone else to acts as his guarantor, in which case he does not need the 
    permission of the creditor. 

    For more information on the rulings on jihad and when it is 
    an individual obligation and when it is a communal obligation, please see 
    question no. 34830. 

    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said in 
    al-Mughni (13/28): “Whoever owes a debt that is due to be paid now or at 
    some time in the future, it is not permissible for him to go out to fight 
    except with the permission of his creditor, unless he leaves behind enough 
    to pay it off or leaves something in pledge with him or he asks someone else 
    to acts as his guarantor. This is the view of al-Shaafa’i. 

    The evidence for that is that a man came to the Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: O 
    Messenger of Allaah, if I am killed for the sake of Allaah, and bear that 
    with patience, seeking the reward of Allaah, will that expiate for my sins? 
    He said: “Yes, except for debt. Jibreel told me that.” Narrated by Muslim. 

    That is because what is sought in jihad is martyrdom in which 
    a person loses his life, and the rights and dues of others are lost as a 
    result. 

    But if it is a case where jihad becomes an individual 
    obligation, then he does not need the permission of his creditor, because it 
    is the matter of individual obligation, which takes precedence over other 
    duties, as in the case of all other individual obligations.   

    If he leaves behind enough to pay it off or asks someone to 
    act as his guarantor, then he may go and fight without (his creditor’s) 
    permission. This was stated by Ahmad concerning one who leaves behind enough 
    to pay it off. That is because ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Haraam, the father of Jaabir 
    ibn ‘Abd-Allaah, went out to Uhud, and he owed a great debt. He was martyred 
    and his son paid off his debt, with the knowledge of the Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not criticize him for that, rather he 
    praised him and said: “The angels continued to shade him with their wings, 
    until you lifted him (from the battlefield).” And he said to his son Jaabir: 
    “Do you know that Allaah brought your father to life and spoke to him 
    directly?”  

    Its says in al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (16/135): 
But if jihad becomes an 
    individual obligation, there is no dispute among the scholars that there is 
    no need for permission from the creditor.” 

    Secondly: In the event that the debtor has enough money to 
    pay off the debt, does going out for jihad take precedence, or paying off 
    the debt? 

    The answer is that if jihad is a communal obligation, then 
    paying off the debt takes precedence, but if jihad is an individual 
    obligation, then one of the following two scenarios must apply: 

    1-If jihad is an individual 
    obligation because he has joined the ranks of the mujaahideen, or the enemy 
    has come to his land, then jihad must take precedence.

    2-If jihad is an individual 
    obligation because the ruler has asked him to go out for jihad, then paying 
    off the debt must take precedence.

    Shaykh al-Islam said in al-Ikhtiyaaraat (p. 308): 

    I was asked about a man who owed a debt and had enough to pay 
    it off, but jihad had become an individual obligation for him. I said: 

    There are some duties that take precedence over paying off a 
    debt, such as spending on oneself, one's wife and one's poor son. And there 
    are some which are superceded by the obligation to pay off a debt, such as 
    acts of worship like Hajj and expiations. And there are some which supercede 
    it unless the creditor is asking for his money, such as sadaqat al-fitr. If 
    jihad becomes an individual obligation in order to ward off harm, such as if 
    the enemy has come (to where he is) or he has joined the ranks of the 
    mujaahideen, then it takes precedence over paying off his debt, as in the 
    case of spending (on himself and his family), and more so. If he is asked to 
    go out for jihad by the ruler, then paying off his debt takes precedence, 
    because the ruler should not ask a debtor to go out for jihad if he is able 
    to do without him. Hence I say that if there is not enough money to feed the 
    hungry and wage jihad without which harm will be caused, then jihad must 
    take precedence even if the hungry people die. 

    I also say that if the creditors are engaged in jihad by 
    spending the money that they are asking the debtors to pay, then the debts 
    must be paid off, so as to achieve two aims: paying off debts and engaging 
    in jihad. The texts of Imam Ahmad are in accordance with what I have written.",Islam Q&A

It was narrated that Ubayy ibn Ka’b said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “A man’s prayer with one other man is better than his praying alone, and a man’s prayer with two other men is better than his praying with one other. The more there are the more beloved that is to Allah.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 554; al-Nasaa’i, 834. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
Al-Bazzaar and al-Tabaraani narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The prayer of two men, one of them leading the other, is better before Allah than the prayer of eight praying separately, and the prayer of four men, one of them leading the others, is better before Allah than the prayer of one hundred praying separately.” Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Targheeb, 412. 
“Better” here means greater in reward. 
“The more there are” means the greater they are in number; that is better than if there are fewer.  
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in Majmoo’ al-Fatawa, 31/221: 
It is better for the people to be gathered in one mosque than scattered between two mosques, because the greater the congregation, the better… then he quoted this hadeeth as evidence. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: 
If we assume that there are two mosques, one of which has a larger congregation than the other, it is better to go to the one which has the larger congregation, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “A man’s prayer with one other man is better than his praying alone, and a man’s prayer with two other men is better than his praying with one other. The more there are the more beloved that is to Allah.” This is general in meaning. So if there are two mosques and one has a larger congregation than the other, then it is better to pray in the one that has the larger congregation. 
Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 4/150, 151. 
Some of the scholars are of the view that congregations do not vary in virtue or reward, because of the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), which says that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Praying in congregation is twenty-seven times better than praying alone.” Agreed upon. So any congregation is twenty-seven times better and no differentiation is made between one congregation and another. 
But this argument was refuted by the following. 
Waliy al-Deen al-‘Iraaqi said: 
The hadeeth does not offer any evidence for those who take it to mean that all congregations are equal, because we say that the least that you will gain is the multiple reward mentioned; that does not mean that the reward may not also be multiplied further for another reason such as the size of the congregation, the honoured status of the mosque, travelling a long way to the mosque and so on. 
Tarh al-Tathreeb, 2/301, 302. 
This means that if the congregation consists of two or more, the multiple reward mentioned in the hadith (twenty-seven times) will be attained. That does not mean that the reward may not be increased for other reasons as well, such as the size of the congregation.

Is there any sin on me, and what is the solution?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The ‘aqeeqah is Sunnah mu’akkadah (a confirmed Sunnah), and there is no sin on the one who does not do it. That is because of the report narrated by Abu Dawood (2842) from ‘Amr ibn Shu’ayb from his father from his grandfather who said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever has a child born to him, and wants to offer a sacrifice on his behalf, let him do so, for a boy two sheep that meet the conditions of sacrifice and for a girl one sheep.” This hadeeth was classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) left the matter up to the wishes of the person doing it. This indicates that it is mustahabb and not obligatory. 
See Tuhfat al-Mawdood, p. 157. 
But the Muslim should not be negligent in this matter, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Every child is in pledge for his ‘aqeeqah which should be sacrificed for him on the seventh day, and his head should be shaved and he should be given a name.”
Narrated by al-Nasaa’i, 4220; Abu Dawood, 2838; al-Tirmidhi, 1522; Ibn Maajah, 3165; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
So you should do the ‘aqeeqah now, by slaughtering a sheep with the intention of ‘aqeeqah. 
In says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (11/934): 
‘Aqeeqah is Sunnah mu’akkadah, for a boy two sheep which are both fit for sacrifice, and for a girl one sheep, which should be slaughtered on the seventh day. If it is delayed until after the seventh day, it is permissible to slaughter it at any time, and there is no sin in delaying it, but it is better to do it sooner if possible. 
Note: 
You say that you have not given anything in charity instead of the ‘aqeeqah. 
It should be noted that giving money in charity cannot take the place of the ‘aqeeqah, because the purpose of the ‘aqeeqah is to draw closer to Allaah by offering a sacrifice. See question no. 34974 .
