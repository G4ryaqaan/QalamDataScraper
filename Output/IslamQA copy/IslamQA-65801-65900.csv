65803,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/65803,Is it permissible for him to break his fast because his work is difficult?,"We live in a western country, which pays no attention to the fast and people who are fasting. My husband is working for one year in order to complete his last year in the pharmacy field, and this work is part of his studies for the final year, i.e. a year of practical work in the field. The problem we are facing is that his work is far away, one hour by car, and the place where he works is crowded with patients. my husband has started to feel dizzy and get headaches whilst working, and he has started to give the medicine to the patients in the wrong way. Now he is thinking of not fasting for this reason, even though the distance from home to work is less than 48 miles, which you mentioned in one of your answers. But the trip takes an hour going and another hour coming back, and the work day is twelve hours non-stop. Is it permissible for him not to fast on the basis that he will make it up after he finishes this final year of his.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Fasting is one of the pillars of Islam which is established by the Qur’aan and Sunnah and by the consensus of the ummah. It is not permissible for the Muslim to break the fast without a legitimate shar’i excuse such as sickness or travel. A person may experience great hardship during the fast but he has to be patient and seek the help of Allah. If a person becomes thirsty during the day in Ramadaan, there is nothing wrong with him pouring water over his head to cool himself down, or rinsing his mouth out with water. If his thirst will cause him a great deal of harm or there is the fear that he may die of thirst, then it is permissible for him to break the fast, but he has to make it up later on. 
But if his work is the cause of the difficulty that he is experiencing, this is not an acceptable reason for breaking the fast, if he can take a leave of absence during Ramadaan, or he can reduce his workload during this month, or he can change his work to something that is easier. 
The scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas said: 
It is well known in Islam, and no Muslim has any excuse for not knowing, that fasting the month of Ramadaan is obligatory for every adult Muslim, and it is one of the pillars of Islam. Every adult Muslim must strive to fast this month, in obedience to the command of Allah, in the hope of His reward and for fear of His punishment, without neglecting his worldly affairs and without letting his worldly interests affect his interests in the Hereafter. If there is a conflict between the acts of worship that have been enjoined by Allah and his work to earn a living in this world, then he must work it out so that he will be able to take care of both. In the example mentioned in the question, he can make the night his time for doing his work to earn his living, and if that is not possible then he should take a leave of absence from his work during the month of Ramadaan, even if that is without pay. If that is not possible, then he should look for another job where he can combine the two duties and his worldly duties will not affect his duties towards the Hereafter. There are many kinds of work and the ways of earning money are not limited to this kind of difficult work. The Muslim will never be without permissible ways of earning a living which will also allow him to fulfil the duties and acts of worship that Allah has enjoined upon him, in sha Allah. 
“And whosoever fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty).
3. And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allah will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allah has set a measure for all things” [al-Talaaq 65:2-3]
If we assume that he cannot find any work other than that which has been mentioned, which is causing such hardship and the fear that the work regulations may be so strict that he cannot practise his religion fully or perform some of its duties, then he should flee for the sake of his religion from that land to a land where he will be able to fulfil his religious and worldly duties, and co-operate with other Muslims in righteousness and piety. The earth of Allah is spacious. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“He who emigrates (from his home) in the Cause of Allah, will find on earth many dwelling places and plenty to live by” [al-Nisa’ 4:100]
“Say (O Muhammad): ‘O My slaves who believe (in the Oneness of Allah Islamic Monotheism), be afraid of your Lord (Allah) and keep your duty to Him. Good is (the reward) for those who do good in this world, and Allah’s earth is spacious (so if you cannot worship Allah at a place, then go to another)! Only those who are patient shall receive their reward in full, without reckoning’” [al-Zumar 39:10]
If none of these options are possible and he is forced to do the kind of hard work that is mentioned in the question, then he should fast until he starts feeling that he is no longer coping, then he should take just enough food and drink to keep him going , then he should refrain from eating and drinking, and he has to make it up during the days when it is easy for him to fast.

They were also asked about a man who works in a bakery and he gets very thirsty and sweats at work. Is it permissible for him to break the fast? 
They replied: 
It is not permissible for him to break the fast; rather he must fast. The fact that he is baking during the day in Ramadaan is not an excuse for him to break the fast. He has to work according to what he is able to do. End quote.

Sunnah actions of prayer","Praise be to Allah.Sunnah acts of prayer
There are many Sunnahs of prayer, both words and actions. What is meant by Sunnahs is things other than the pillars (essential parts) and obligatory parts of the prayer. 
Some of the fuqaha’ stated that there are seventeen verbal Sunnahs in prayer, and fifty-five actions which are Sunnah. The prayer is not invalidated if one omits one of these actions, even if that is done deliberately, unlike the pillars and obligatory parts. 
The difference between a pillar and an obligatory part is that a pillar cannot be waived, whether one omits it deliberately or by mistake, rather it must be done. An obligatory part is waived if one forgets, and it can be compensated for by doing the prostration of forgetfulness (sujood al-sahw). 
It may be useful here to mention the pillars of prayer and its obligatory parts, followed by some of its Sunnahs, based on the book Daleel al-Taalib, which is a well known summary used by Hanbali fuqaha’.
Pillars of prayer
There are 14 pillars of prayer which are as follows:
(1) Standing during obligatory prayers if one is able to do so
(2) The opening takbeer (saying “Allahu akbar”)
(3) Reciting al-Faatihah
(4) Rukoo’ (bowing), the least of which means bending so that the hands can touch the knees, but the most complete form means making the back level and the head parallel with it.
(5) Rising from bowing
(6) Standing up straight
(7) Sujood (prostration), the most perfect form of which is placing the forehead, nose, palms, knees and toes firmly on the ground, and the least of which is placing a part of each of these on the ground.
(8) Rising from prostration
(9) Sitting between the two prostrations. However one sits is good enough, but the Sunnah is to sit muftarishan, which means sitting on the left foot and holding the right foot upright with the toes pointing towards the qiblah.
(10) Being at ease in each of these physical pillars
(11) The final tashahhud
(12) Sitting to recite the final tashahhud and the two salaams
(13) The two salaams. This means saying twice, “al-salaamu ‘alaykum wa rahmat-Allah (Peace be upon you and the mercy of Allah).” In naafil prayers it is sufficient to say one salaam; the same also applies to the funeral prayer.
(14) Doing the pillars in the order mentioned here. If a person deliberately prostrates before bowing, for example, the prayer is invalidated; if he does that by mistake, he has to go back and bow, and then prostrate.
Obligatory parts of prayer
The obligatory parts of prayer are eight, which are as follows:
(1) Takbeers other than the opening takbeer
(2) Saying “Sami’a Allahu liman hamidah (Allah hears those who praise Him” – for the imam and for the one who is praying alone.
(3) Saying “Rabbana wa laka’l-hamd (Our Lord, to You be praise)”
(4) Saying “Subhaana rabbiy al-‘azeem (Glory be to my Lord Almighty)” once when bowing
(5) Saying “Subhaana rabbiy al-a’laa (Glory be to my Lord most High)” once when prostrating
(6) Saying “Rabb ighfir li (Lord forgive me)” between the two prostrations
(7)The first tashahhud
(8) Sitting for the first tashahhud
Verbal Sunnahs of prayer
The verbal Sunnahs are eleven, which are as follows:
 (1) Saying after the opening takbeer, “Subhaanaka Allahumma wa bi hamdika, wa tabaaraka ismuka, wa ta’aala jadduka wa laa ilaaha ghayruka (Glory and praise be to You, O Allah; blessed be Your name, exalted be Your Majesty, and there is no god but You).” This is called du’aa’ al-istiftaah (opening du’aa’)
(2) Seeking refuge with Allah
(3) Saying Bismillaah
(4) Saying Ameen
(5) Reciting a soorah after al-Faatihah
(6) Reciting out loud, in the case of the imam
(7) Saying after the tahmeed (Rabbana wa laka’l-hamd), for one who is not praying behind an imam: “Mil’ al-samawaati wa mil’ al-ard wa mil’ ma shi’ta min shay’in ba’d (Filling the heavens, filling the earth, and filling whatever else You wish).” (The correct view is that it is also Sunnah for one who is praying in congregation)
(8) Saying the tasbeeh when bowing more than once, such as a second or third time or more
(9) Saying the tasbeeh in prostration more than once
(10) Saying “Rabb ighfir li (Lord forgive me)” more than once between the two prostrations
(11) Sending prayers upon the family of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the last tashahhud and sending blessings upon him and upon them, and saying du’aa’ after that.
Sunnah actions of prayer
The Sunnah actions are called postures. They are as follows:
(1) Raising the hands when saying the opening takbeer
(2) Raising the hands when bowing
(3) Raising the hands when rising from bowing
(4) Dropping them after that
(5) Placing the right hand over the left
(6) Looking towards the place of prostration
(7) Standing with the feet apart
(8) Holding the knees with fingers spread apart when bowing, holding the back straight and making the head parallel with it.
(9) Placing the parts of the body on which one prostrates firmly on the ground, apart from the knees, because it is makrooh to press them firmly on the ground.
(10) Keeping the elbows away from the sides, and the belly from the thighs, and the thighs from the calves; keeping the knees apart; holding the feet upright; holding the toes apart on the ground; placing the hands level with the shoulders with the fingers spread.
(11) Sitting muftarishan between the two prostrations and in the first tashahhud, and sitting mutawarrikan in the second tashahhud.
(12) Placing the hands on the thighs with the fingers together between the two prostrations, and in the tashahhud, except that in the latter the pinkie and ring fingers should be held in, a circle made with the middle finger and thumb, and one should point with the forefinger when remembering Allah.
(13) Turning to the right and left when saying the salaam
There are some differences of opinion among the fuqaha’ regarding some of these issues; what is regarded as obligatory by some is regarded as Sunnah by others. This is discussed in detail in the books of fiqh.

65852,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/65852,Her period comes regularly but the bleeding stops for half a day or a day at the beginning and end,"My wife gets her period regularly, but it starts with a little bleeding, which then stops for half a day or a full day. The same thing happens at the end of her period. When should she stop fasting and praying and when should she resume?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.If a woman 
    sees menstrual blood she must stop praying and fasting, and if the bleeding 
    stops during the period it depends: 
1 – If 
    traces of blood remain, such that if she inserts a piece of cloth or 
    whatever it comes out with traces of blood, then the period is not regarded 
    as having ended, and she should still refrain from praying and fasting, 
    whether that happens at the beginning of the period or at the end. 
2 – If the 
    bleeding stops altogether, such that if she inserts a piece of cloth it 
    comes out clean with no traces of blood, then this is the sign that her 
    period has ended, so she is taahir (pure). She should do ghusl and pray and 
    fast and do all that women who are taahir do. Then if the bleeding resumes 
    she should stop again. 
The ruling 
    that being free of any trace of blood during the time of menses is regarded 
    as tuhr (purity) is the view of the Maalikis and Hanbalis. 
See 
    Mataalib Ooli al-‘Nuha, 1/260. 
In the 
    answer to question no. 37839 
    we have mentioned the view of the scholars of the Standing Committee: 
If the 
    menses stops for one day or one night during the time of menses, then she 
    should do ghusl and pray whatever prayers come when she is taahir, because 
    Ibn ‘Abbaas said: “If she sees blood that is heavy or copious, she should 
    not pray, and if she sees the tuhr for a while, she should do ghusl. End

65853,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/65853,Situations in which the obligation to face the qiblah is waived,What are the situations in which we can face a direction other than the qiblah?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Perhaps the questioner wants to know about the situations in which the obligation to face the qiblah whilst praying is waived, and it is valid to face a direction other than the qiblah. 
One of the conditions of prayer being valid is facing the qiblah, and prayer is not valid without that, because Allah has enjoined that repeatedly in the Quran. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“so turn your face in the direction of Al-Masjid Al-Haram (at Makkah). And wheresoever you people are, turn your faces (in prayer) in that direction” [al-Baqarah 2:144]
When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) first came to Madeenah, he used to pray facing towards al-Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem), with the Ka’bah behind him and Syria in front of him. But after that he hoped [?} that Allah would change that, so he started lifting his face towards the heavens, looking for Jibreel to come down with the Revelation telling him to turn towards the Ka’bah, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, We have seen the turning of your (Muhammad’s) face towards the heaven. Surely, We shall turn you to a Qiblah (prayer direction) that shall please you, so turn your face in the direction of Al-Masjid Al-Haram (at Makkah)”[al-Baqarah 2:144]
So Allah commanded him to turn towards al-Masjid al-Haram, but there are three exceptions from that: 
1 – If a person is unable to do that, such as one who is sick and is facing a direction other than the qiblah, and cannot turn to face it. The duty to face towards the qiblah is waived in this case, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can” [al-Taghaabun 64:16] 
“Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope” [al-Baqarah 2:286]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If I command you to do a thing, then do as much of it as you can.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 7288; Muslim, 1337. 
2 – If a person is a state of intense fear, such as one who is fleeing from an enemy or from a wild animal, or from a flood which may drown him. In that case he should pray no matter which direction he is facing. The evidence for that is the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And if you fear (an enemy), perform Salaah (pray) on foot or riding. And when you are in safety, offer the Salaah (prayer) in the manner He has taught you, which you knew not (before)” [al-Baqarah 2:239]
The phrase “if you fear” is general in meaning and includes all kinds of fear. And the phrase “And when you are in safety, offer the Salaah (prayer) in the manner He has taught you, which you knew not (before)” indicates that whatever part of the prayer a person omitted because of fear, there is no sin on him because of that – and that includes facing towards the qiblah. 
This is also indicated by the two verses quoted above, and the hadeeth in which it says that obligations are connected to one’s ability to do them. 
3 – When offering naafil (supererogatory) prayers when travelling, whether by plane, car or atop a camel; one may pray in whatever direction one is facing. This applies to naafil prayers such as Witr, night prayers (qiyaam), Duha and so on. 
The traveller should offer all the naafil prayers exactly like one who is not travelling, except the regular Sunnah prayers such as the Sunnahs of Zuhr, Maghrib and ‘Isha’. The Sunnah is not to offer these prayers. 
If a person wants to offer naafil prayers whilst travelling, he may offer them whatever direction he is facing. This is narrated in al-Saheehayn from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
In these three cases it is not obligatory to face towards the qiblah. 
With regard to one who is ignorant, he has to face towards the qiblah, but if he tries to work it out then he finds out that he got it wrong, he does not have to repeat the prayer. We do not say that the obligation to face the qiblah is waived, rather he has to face the qiblah and he should try his best to do so. If he does his best then finds out that he got it wrong, he does not have to repeat his prayer. The evidence for that is the fact that the Sahaabah who were unaware that the qiblah had been changed to the Ka’bah were praying Fajr one day in the mosque of Quba’ when a man came to them and said: “Quran has been revealed to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) this night, and he has been commanded to face towards the Ka’bah, so turn to face it.” They were facing towards Syria and they turned to face towards the Ka’bah.
Narrated by al-Bukhari, 304; Muslim, 526. 
After the Ka’bah had been behind them, they put it in front of them, so they turned around but continued to pray. This happened at the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), but he did not denounce it, so it is acceptable according to sharee’ah, i.e., if a person makes a mistake in the direction of the qiblah because he is unaware of it, he does not have to repeat the prayer, but if he comes to know of it, even during the prayer, then he has to turn to face the qiblah. 
Facing towards the qiblah is one of the conditions of prayer without which the prayer is not valid, except in the three cases mentioned above, unless a person makes a mistake after doing his best to find out.

I got engaged two years ago, praise be to Allaah, but my income is little. Praise be to Allaah I have got a contract in one of the Arab counties with a good salary, but I am hesitating to accept the job because I am my parents’ only son, and the only brother of three girls. If I travel for the sake of my future and so that I can get married, will there be any element of disobedience towards my parents? If I travel I will be leaving them on their own and they are elderly. Please note that if I get married here I will never live with them, and they are preventing me from moving out of their house. Please advise me as to what is best and is right.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
      Firstly: 

    If one or both of your parents needs you to serve them, and 
    there is no one else who can do that after you travel, then you should not 
    travel without their permission. 

    If they give you permission to travel or they do not need 
    you, either because they are able to take care of themselves or because 
    there is someone else who can look after them, then there is nothing wrong 
    with you travelling in order to get married in that case, so as to preserve 
    your chastity. But even if they do not give you permission, your travelling 
    is not regarded as disobedience towards them. 

    But it is undoubtedly better to please them and to explain to 
    them that travelling is in your best interests, and that you will never 
    neglect them, and that you will be away only so long as you need to, then 
    you will come back to them, and so on. 

    The scholars (may Allaah have mercy on them) stated that it 
    is permissible for a son to travel in order to seek provision without his 
    parents’ permission, subject to the condition that travelling is safe and 
    will not put the son in any danger, and that they do not need him to be 
    there. 

    Al-Kaasaani said in Badaa’i’ al-Sanaa’i’ (7/98), in 
    his discussion on jihad if it is fard kifaayah (a communal obligation): 

    It is not permissible for a slave to go out except with the 
    permission of his master, or for a woman to go out except with the 
    permission of her husband, because serving one’s master and fulfilling the 
    husband’s rights are individual obligations (fard ‘ayn) which take 
    precedence over communal obligations (fard kifaayah). Similarly a son should 
    not go out without the permission of his parents, or of one of them if the 
    other is dead, because honouring one’s parents is an individual obligation 
    which takes precedence over communal obligations. 

    The basic principle is that if travelling is not safe and the 
    traveller may die or be exposed to severe danger, it is not permissible for 
    a son to travel without his parents’ permission, because they love their son 
    and will be harmed by that. If there is little danger involved, it is 
    permissible for him to go out without their permission so long as he does 
    not neglect them, because there is no harm involved. Some of our shaykhs 
    granted a concession allowing a son to travel in order to seek knowledge 
    without parental permission, because they will not be harmed by that, rather 
    they will benefit from it, so it cannot be described as disobedience to 
    parents. End quote. 

    Al-Sarkhasi said in al-Siyar al-Kabeer (1/197): 

    If a person wishes to undertake a journey that is not for 
    jihad – such as for business, Hajj or ‘Umrah – and his parents object to 
    that, but there is no fear that they will suffer hardship because of his 
    absence, then there is nothing wrong with him travelling, because in most 
    cases these journeys are safe and his travelling will not cause them undue 
    hardship. The sorrow at his absence is offset by their looking forward to 
    his return. But if there is the fear of danger on the journey, then it comes 
    under the same ruling as going out for jihad, because it is more likely that 
    he will die on such a journey. End quote. 

    Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmoo’ (8/314): 

    If a son wants to travel in order to seek knowledge, then 
    al-Musannif (i.e., Abu Ishaaq al-Shiraazi (may Allaah have mercy on him)) 
    stated at the beginning of Kitaab al-Siyar that it is permissible for 
    him to do so without his parents’ permission. He said: The same applies to 
    travelling for business purposes, because in most cases such journeys are 
    safe. 

    Secondly: 

    With regard to your not living with them after you get 
    married, even though they want you to stay with them, there is no sin on you 
    in that, in sha Allaah, because that does not mean that you are neglecting 
    them or harming them, especially since there are reasons for you not to do 
    so, such as the house being small, or your wife wanting to live in her own 
    home – which is her right – and other such reasons. 

    It should be noted that your living apart from them does not 
    mean that you should not ask about them, or meet their needs or honour them. 
    Rather these are duties which you owe them, especially now that you are an 
    adult. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. 
    And that you be dutiful to your parents. If one of them or both of them 
    attain old age in your life, say not to them a word of disrespect, nor shout 
    at them but address them in terms of honour.
24. And lower unto them 
    the wing of submission and humility through mercy, and say: ‘My Lord! Bestow 
    on them Your Mercy as they did bring me up when I was young’”

    [al-Isra’ 17:23, 24]

    Honouring one’s parents opens the door to Paradise, so strive 
    to please them and treat them kindly, and do not upset them.

65868,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/65868,A person is sick with gonorrhoea; will his prayers and fasting be accepted?,Will prayers and fasting be accepted from a person who is sick with gonorrhoea?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
      Firstly: 

    In general the term marad al-sayalaan (translated here 
    as gonorrhoea) refers to an infected discharge from the urethra in both men 
    and women. This does not have any impact on one's fasting. 

    Secondly: 

    With regard to prayer, the state of purity (tahaarah) in 
    invalidated by everything that comes out of the front or back passages, such 
    as urine, stools, wind, prostatic fluid, blood, pus and other secretions. 

    See question no. 14321 

    Based on this, the pus or infected discharge that is emitted 
    in the case of gonorrhoea invalidates wudoo’. But if this discharge is 
    continuous and the sick person cannot control it, then he comes under the 
    same ruling as one who suffers from incontinence and cannot control his 
    urine, which is emitted involuntarily. 

    The ruling is: 

    If he knows that this emission comes out at certain times and 
    then stops for long enough for him to purify himself and pray, then he has 
    to wait until it stops, even if that means missing the prayer in 
    congregation, and he should do wudoo’ and pray at the time when the 
    discharge has stopped, so long as there is no fear that the time for prayer 
    may end.

    But if the discharge is continual and does not stop, then he 
    has to put a piece of cloth over his private part, or something else that 
    will prevent the impurity from spreading and contaminating his body or 
    clothes, and he should do wudoo’ for each prayer after the time for it 
    begins. Then it will not matter if something is emitted after doing wudoo’, 
    even if that is during the prayer. 

    He may also offer whatever naafil prayers he wishes with this 
    wudoo’, until the time for the obligatory prayer for which he did wudoo’ is 
    over. 

    See question no. 22843 
    and 39494 

    This is the answer if what the questioner means is: is prayer 
    and fasting valid if there is continual emission of this pus? 

    But if what he means is that this person committed the major 
    sin of zina (because most cases of gonorrhoea occur as the result of illicit 
    relationships), then he should note that whoever repents to Allaah, Allaah 
    will accept his repentance, and the one who repents from sin is like one who 
    has not sinned. No matter what sins a person commits, if he then repents to 
    Allaah and turns to Him, and regrets what he has done, then he will find 
    that Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. Allaah says (interpretation of 
    the meaning): 

    “Say: O ‘Ibaadi (My slaves) who have transgressed against 
    themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of 
    Allaah, verily, Allaah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft‑Forgiving, Most 
    Merciful”

    [al-Zumar 39:53]
al-Tirmidhi (3540) 
    narrated that Anas ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: I heard 
    the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    say: “Allaah says: ‘O son of Adam, were your sins to reach the clouds of the 
    sky, then you were to ask me for forgiveness, I would forgive them and I 
    would not mind.’” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
The phrase “the clouds of 
    the sky” is used to give an impression of great height, to indicate a huge 
    amount of sins.

This evening medicine makes me tired and sometimes I can't wake up for suhur and then I miss my morning medicine. And it is late to take the morning medicine at iftar time. What should I do? I have been fasting for a few days now but I stopped today because of this medication. Is it possible that I pay sadaqa at the end of Ramadan?,"If you can take the medicine once when breaking the fast and once at suhur, then this is what you have to do, and it is not permissible for you to break the fast because there is no excuse that makes it permissible not to fast.","Can sick people skip fasting?

We ask Allah, the Lord of the mighty Throne, to heal you and to reward you. 
In the answer to question No. 12488 , we described the kind of sickness which makes it permissible for a person to break the fast. This is any sickness that causes intense hardship for one who fasts, or there is the fear that his sickness may become worse or his recovery may be delayed if he fasts. If your situation is like this, then it is permissible for you not to fast in Ramadan. 
Is it permissible to take medicine while fasting?
If you can take the medicine once when breaking the fast and once at suhur, then this is what you have to do, and it is not permissible for you to break the fast in that case, because there is no excuse that  makes it permissible not to fast.
But if that is not possible, and you have no choice but to take the medicine during the day, then it is permissible for you not to fast. 
Can sick people give charity instead of fasting?
With regard to giving charity instead of fasting, you have to refer to trustworthy doctors. If there is the hope of recovery from your sickness, then you have to make up the fasts and it is not permissible for you to feed others instead, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “but if any of you is ill or on a journey, the same number (should be made up) from other days” [al-Baqarah 2:184].  So you should wait until Allah heals you then make up the days that you did not fast. 
But if there is no hope of recovery from your sickness , then you do not have to make up for the missed fasts, and you have to feed one poor person for every day. 
It should be noted that what is required is to give food, and giving money instead of food does not count. This has been explained in the answer to question no. 39234

I know about Taraweeh prayer, reciting Qur’aan a great deal, seeking forgiveness a great deal and praying at night. But I want to know some words I can repeat during my daily duties such as when I am cooking or doing housework, because I do not want to miss out on the reward.","Whoever does not fast some days of Ramadan has to make up those days before the next Ramadan comes. For more, please see the detailed answer.",,"Praise be to Allah.May Allaah reward you with good for this concern and eagerness to do good and righteous deeds during this blessed month.
To the good deeds that you have mentioned may be added charity, feeding the poor, going for ‘Umrah and observing i’tikaaf for those who are able to do so.
As for the words that you can repeat whilst you are working, these include tasbeeh (saying Subhaan Allaah (Glory be to Allaah)), tahleel (saying Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah (There is no god but Allaah)), takbeer (saying Allaahu akbar (Allaah is most Great)), praying for forgiveness, making du’aa’ and responding to the muezzin. Keep your tongue moist with the remembrance of Allaah and seek a great reward with a few words which you can utter. For every tasbeehah you will have (the reward of) one charity, for every tahmeedah (saying Alhamdulillah (Praise be to Allaah)) you will have (the reward of) one charity, for every takbeerah you will have (the reward of) one charity, and for every tahleelah you will have (the reward of) one charity.
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Every person’s every joint must perform a charity every day the sun comes up, every tasbeehah is a charity, every tahmeedah is a charity, every tahleelah is a charity, every takbeerah is a charity, enjoining what is good is a charity, forbidding what is evil is a charity, and if you do two rak’ahs at duha time (the forenoon), that may be sufficient.” Narrated by Muslim, 720.
And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Two words which are light on the tongue and heavy in the Balance, and beloved to the Most Merciful: Subhaana Allaah wa bihamdih, subhaan Allaah il-‘Azeem (Glory and praise be to Allaah, glory be to Allaah the Almighty).” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6682; Muslim, 2694.
And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever says ‘Subhaan Allaah il-‘Azeem wa bi hamdih (Glory and praise be to Allaah the Almighty),’ a palm tree will be planted for him in Paradise.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3465; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi.
And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever says ‘Astaghfir Allaah ul-‘azeem alladhi laa ilaaha illa huwa al-hayy ul-qayyoom wa atoobu ilayh (I seek the forgiveness of Allaah the Almighty, beside Whom there is no other god, and I repent to Him),’ will be forgiven even if he fled from the battlefield.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 1517; al-Tirmidhi, 3277’ classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.
And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no Muslim on earth who prays to Allaah for something but Allaah will grant him it, or divert an equivalent evil from him, so long as he does not pray for sin or the severing of family ties.” A man among the people said: “Then we will pray a great deal.” He said: “Allaah is most generous.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3573; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi.
And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When you hear the muezzin, say what he says, then send blessings upon me, for whoever send one blessing upon me, Allaah will send ten blessings upon him. Then ask Allaah to grant me al-waseelah, which is a position in Paradise which will be attained by only one of the slaves of Allaah, and I hope that I will be the one. Whoever asks for al-waseelah for me, intercession will be granted for him.” Narrated by Muslim, 384.
And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever says when he hears the call to prayer, ‘Allaahumma rabba hadhhi’l-da’wat il-taammah wa’l-salaat il-qaa’imah, aati Muhammadan al-waseelah wa’l-fadeelah wab’athhu maqaaman mahmoodan alladhi wa’adtahu (O Allaah, Lord of this perfect call and the prayer which is about to begin, grant Muhammad al-waseelah (a station in Paradise) and al-fadeelah (a rank above the rest of creation), and raise him to the praised position that You have promised),’ my intercession will be granted for him on the Day of Resurrection.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 614.

65877,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/65877,The reason why Quran is recited out loud in the nighttime prayers and silently in the daytime prayers,"What is the reason why Quran is recited out loud in Maghrib and ‘Isha’ prayers? 
What is the reason why it is recited aloud only in the first two rak’ahs of ‘Isha’ and not in all four rak’ahs?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
The Muslim is required to follow the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and follow his example, whether he knows the reason behind a ruling or he does not. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Indeed in the Messenger of Allah (Muhammad) you have a good example to follow for him who hopes for (the Meeting with) Allah and the Last Day, and remembers Allah much”
[al-Ahzaab 33:21]
He should also be certain that Islam is based on great wisdom, but this wisdom may be known to us or we may be unaware of it, or we may know some of it and not the rest of it. 
There is nothing wrong with a person asking the reason and trying to find out, because knowing it will increase his knowledge and peace of mind. 
Secondly: 
Some of the scholars have pondered the reason why Quran is recited out loud in the nighttime prayers and silently in the daytime prayers, and the summary of what they have mentioned concerning that is: 
The night is a time when people are quiet, alone and more focused, so it is prescribed to recite Quran out loud at that time so as to make manifest the pleasure of a person’s conversing with his Lord, and so that the heart, tongue and ears will be involved in the recitation. 
This meaning is suggested by the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, the rising by night (for Tahajjud prayer) is very hard and most potent and good for governing oneself, and most suitable for (understanding) the Word (of Allah).
7. Verily, there is for you by day prolonged occupation with ordinary duties” [al-Muzzammil 74:6-7]
Ibn Katheer said: 
The point is that this rising may be at any time of night. What is meant here is that when praying at night, both the heart and the tongue are focused on the recitation, hence Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “is very hard and most potent and good for governing oneself, and most suitable for (understanding) the Word (of Allah)” i.e., the mind will be more focused when reciting and will understand the words more than during the day, which is a time when people move about and there is a great deal of noise, and it is the time of seeking provision. End quote. 
Al-Qurtubi (19/40) said: 
What is meant is that the heart, sight, hearing and tongue work together in harmony when reciting Quran, because voices and movements are stilled. End quote. 
Al-Sa’di (may Allah have mercy on him) said (p. 1058): “Verily, the rising by night (for Tahajjud prayer) is very hard and most potent and good for governing oneself, and most suitable for (understanding) the Word (of Allah)” i.e., it is more likely to achieve the purpose of the Quran, where both heart and tongue are focused, because there are fewer distractions, one can understand what one recites, and does the prayer properly. 
This is unlike the day, when these purposes cannot be achieved. Hence Allah says “Verily, there is for you by day prolonged occupation with ordinary duties” – i.e., going about to attend to your needs and living, which means that the heart is distracted and cannot focus fully. End quote.  
It says in Tuhfat al-Muhtaaj: 
There remains the wisdom behind reciting out loud – what is it? It may be that it is because night is the time when one is alone and people get together for lighthearted talk. So it is prescribed to recite Quran out loud at that time so as to make manifest the pleasure of a person’s conversing with his Lord. This applies only to the first two rak’ahs because the worshipper has more energy then. Because the day is the time of distractions and mixing with people, it is required to recite silently, because the daytime is not the best time to focus fully on conversing with Allah. The morning (Fajr) prayer is joined to the night prayers because its time is not usually a time when there are distractions, like Friday. End quote. 
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said in I’laam al-Muwaqqi’een (2/91): 
With regard to the distinction between the nighttime prayers and the daytime prayers, in terms of reciting out loud and reciting silently, there is great wisdom in that, because the night is a time when voices and movements are stilled, and hearts are focused and have renewed energy. The day is the time when people are busy with their day-to-day occupations, and the night is the time when a person can focus with his heart on what he is saying with his tongue. Hence the Sunnah is to make the recitations in Fajr longer than in other prayers. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to recite between sixty and one hundred verses in them, and Abu Bakr used to recite al-Baqarah in them, and ‘Umar used to recite al-Nahl, Hood, Bani Israa’eel, Yoonus and similar soorahs, because the heart is more free of distractions when it has just been wakened from sleep. If the first thing that a person hears is the word of Allah in which there is all goodness, then these words will come to his heart which is free form any distraction, and will thus have a great impact on him. As for the day, the opposite is the case, so Quran is recited silently unless there is a reason, such as the large gatherings on Eid and Jumu’ah (Friday), and when offering prayers for rain and the eclipse prayer. On those occasions it is better to recite out loud and that is more likely to achieve the objective and is more beneficial, and because this serves to convey the words of Allah when there is a large gathering.

65893,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/65893,He is suffering from waswaas and fears that his fast may be invalidated because of snuffing water up into the nostrils,"I am (may Allaah heal me) one of those who are affected by waswaas (whispers from the Shaytaan). When doing wudoo’ whilst fasting I try not to exaggerate in snuffing water up into my nostrils, but I feel something in my throat. Is my fasting invalidated by that?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
      Firstly: 

    You have done well by not exaggerating in snuffing up water 
    into your nostrils, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) said to Laqeet ibn Sabirah: Do wudoo’ properly, let the water 
    run between your fingers and toes and exaggerate in snuffing water up into 
    the nostrils, except when you are fasting.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 142; 
    al-Tirmidhi, 788; al-Nasaa’i, 87; Ibn Maajah, 407; classed as saheeh by 
    al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi.  

    Secondly: 

    If a fasting person rinses his mouth or snuffs water up into 
    his nostrils and some of the water reaches his stomach without any such 
    intention on his part, then his fast is not broken. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And there is no sin on 
    you concerning that in which you made a mistake, except in regard to what 
    your hearts deliberately intend”

    [al-Ahzaab 33:5]

    This person did not intend in his heart to do the 
    fast-breaking action, so his fast is still valid. 

    End quote from al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 6/240, 246. 

    Thirdly: 

    The best remedy for waswaas is to ignore it and not to pay 
    any attention to it, whilst remembering Allaah a great deal, and worshipping 
    and obeying Him, and avoiding sin.
