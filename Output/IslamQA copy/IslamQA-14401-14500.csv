          obligation of zakaah is subject to several conditions:  
Freedom: 
          zakaah is not obligatory upon a slave, because he has no property or 
          wealth. Whatever he owns is the property of his master, so the zakaah 
          is obligatory upon his master.  
Islam: 
          because the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, according to the hadeeth 
          of Mu’aadh (may Allaah be pleased with him): “Call them to testify that 
          there is no god except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of 
          Allaah,” then he mentioned prayer, then he said: “and if they obey you 
          in that, then teach them that Allaah has enjoined upon them charity 
          (zakaah) to be taken from their rich and given to their poor.” 
          (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, al-Zakaah, 1365; Muslim, al-Eemaan, 
          28).  
Owning the nisaab (minimum 
          amount or threshold): zakaah is not obligatory upon wealth or property 
          that does not meet the minimum amount, which is a known amount of wealth.
Full 
          control: such that no one else has any rights to the wealth; there is 
          no zakaah on wealth that one does not own with full control.  
The 
          passing of one complete (hijri) year: because of the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah 
          (may Allaah be pleased with her), who said: “I heard the Messenger of 
          Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: ‘There is no zakaah 
          on wealth until one full year has passed.’” (Narrated by Ibn Maajah, 
          al-Zakaah, 1782; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh 
          Sunan Ibn Maajah, no. 1449).  
These 
          are the conditions for zakaah being obligatory; if these conditions 
          are met, then zakaah is obligatory.  
Based 
          on the above, it may be said that you do not possess the money, let 
          alone saying that you have full control over it. If you possess the 
          money and the other conditions are also met, then you should pay zakaah 
          on it. And Allaah knows best.

14403,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14403,Who Is the Holy Spirit?,"In the Quran in 2:87, an excerpt: ...We gave Jesus the son of Mary clear (signs) and strengthened him with the Holy Spirit. What is the Holy Spirit?","According to the Quran, the “Holy Spirit” (Ruh al-Qudus) is Jibril (peace be upon him). For more, see the detailed answer.","Who is the ‘Holy Spirit’ in the Quran?


Reference to the ‘Holy Spirit’ in the Sunnah","Praise be to Allah.Who is the ‘Holy Spirit’ in the Quran?
The “Holy Spirit” (Ruh al-Qudus) is Jibril (peace be upon him). Shaykh al-Shanqiti said: “The words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning), ‘and [We] supported him with Ruh al-Qudus’ [al-Baqarah 2:87] refer to Jibril according to the most sound view. This is indicated by the words (interpretation of the meaning): ‘Which the trustworthy Ruh has brought down’ [al-Shu’ara 26:193] and ‘then We sent to her our Ruh’ [Maryam 19:17].”
Ibn Abi Hatim narrated from Ahmad ibn Sinan… Abu’l-Za’ra told us: ‘Abd-Allah said: Ruh al-Qudus (“the Holy Spirit”) is Jibril, then he said: something similar was narrated from Muhammad ibn Ka’b al-Qurazi, Qatadah, ‘Atiyyah al-‘Awfi, al-Saddi and al-Rabi’ ibn Anas.
Reference to the ‘Holy Spirit’ in the Sunnah
This view is supported by the above and by the report narrated by the two Shaykhs [al-Bukhari and Muslim] with their isnads from Abu Salamah ibn ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn ‘Awf, that he heard Hassan ibn Thabit al-Anaari asking Abu Hurayrah to bear witness, “I ask you by Allah, did you hear the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say, ‘O Hassan, respond on behalf of the Messenger of Allah. O Allah, support him with Ruh al-Qudus’?” Abu Hurayrah said, “Yes.” (Al-Tafsir al-Masbur by Dr. Hikmat Bashir, 1/192-193)
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: 
“The majority of scholars said that this refers to Jibril (peace be upon him), and that Allah called him al-Ruh al-Ameen, Ruh al-Qudus and Jibril.” (Daqaiq al-Tafsir, part 1, p. 310)
He wrote an entire chapter on that and said:
""Chapter on the meaning of Ruh al-Qudus:
Allah said (interpretation of the meaning):
“O ‘Isa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary)! Remember My Favour to you and to your mother when I supported you with Ruh ul Qudus [Jibril (Gabriel)]…” [al-Maidah 5:110]
Allah supported the Messiah (peace be upon him) with Ruh al-Qudus as He mentions in this ayah. In al-Baqarah Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And We gave ‘Isa (Jesus), the son of Maryam (Mary), clear signs and supported him with Ruh-ul-Qudus [Jibril (Gabriel).] [al-Baqarah 2:87]
“Those Messengers! We preferred some of them to others; to some of them Allâh spoke (directly); others He raised to degrees (of honour); and to ‘Isa (Jesus), the son of Maryam (Mary), We gave clear proofs and evidences, and supported him with Ruh ul Qudus [Jibril (Gabriel)]” [al-Baqarah 2:253]
This is not limited only to the Messiah; others were also supported in this way. (The scholars) mentioned that Dawud said, “Do not stop supporting me with Ruh al-Qudus.” And our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to Hassan ibn Thabit, “O Allah, support him with Ruh al-Qudus.” According to another report: “Ruh al-Qudus will be with you so long as you are defending His Prophet.” Both versions are narrated in al-Sahih.
According to the Christians, the “Holy Spirit” dwelt in the Disciples, and according to them the “Holy Spirit” is something experienced by all of the Prophets. But Allah says in al-Nahl (interpretation of the meaning):
“Say (O Muhammad) Ruh ul Qudus [Jibril (Gabriel)] has brought it (the Quran) down from your Lord with truth, that it may make firm and strengthen (the faith of) those who believe, and as a guidance and glad tidings to those who have submitted (to Allah as Muslims).” [al-Nahl 16:102]
“Which the trustworthy Ruh [Jibril (Gabriel)] has brought down upon your heart (O Muhammad).” [al-Shu’ara’ 26:193]
“Whoever is an enemy to Jibril (Gabriel) (let him die in his fury), for indeed he has brought it (this Quran) down to your heart.” [al-Baqarah 2:97]
So it is clear that Ruh al-Qudus here refers to Jibril… No one suggests that Ruh al-Qudus means the life of Allah ; nor is this indicated by the wording and this phrase is never used in that sense.” (Daqaiq al-Tafsir, part 2, p. 92)

Specific animals which it is said will themselves be in Paradise, such as the dog of the people of the Cave and the she-camel of Salih (peace be upon him). There are no authentic reports concerning them. 
Those which are mentioned in the Quran and Sunnah, which Allah has prepared for the believers in Paradise, whether they are mentioned in specific terms,  such as the birds of which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“And with the flesh of fowls that they desire.” [Al-Waqi`ah 56:21]
or mentioned in general terms, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And We shall provide them with fruit and meat such as they desire.” [At-Tur 52:22]
Another example is the bull which Allah has prepared as food for the people of Paradise , as was narrated from Thawban the freed slave of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who said: “I was standing by the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when one of the Jewish rabbis came and said, ‘Peace be upon you, O Muhammad,’ and I pushed him back so hard that he nearly fell over… He (the Jew) said: ‘What would be their food after this?’ He (the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)) said: ‘A bull which was fed in the different quarters of Paradise would be slaughtered for them’…” (Narrated by Muslim, 315) 

Those animals which have been specifically mentioned in the authentic Sunnah, which will be in Paradise. These include: 


It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Pray in the sheep pens and wipe their dust (ragham), for they are among the animals of Paradise.” (Narrated by al-Bayhaqi, 2/449; classed as sahih by Al-Albani in Sahih Al-Jami`, 3789)

Ragham means dust (as translated here). The word has also been narrated as ra`am, which refers to the mucus that comes from the sheep’s nose. What is meant is to wipe the dust from it, or wipe away what comes from its nose, so as to look after it and take care of it. This was the view of Al-Manawi in Fayd Al-Qadir. 

It was narrated that Abu Mas`ud Al-Ansari said: A man brought a bridled she-camel and said, “This is for the sake of Allah.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “You will have seven hundred she-camels in return on the Day of Resurrection, each of them bridled.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1892)

An-Nawawi said: 
“What is meant by makhtumah (bridled) is that it has a khitam (bridle) on it, which is like a halter. And it was said that that it may be understood as meaning that he will have the reward of giving seven hundred she-camels, or it may be understood as it appears to be, and that he will have seven hundred she-camels in Paradise, each of them bridled, and he will be able to ride them wherever he wants, for pleasure, as was narrated concerning the horses and camels (nujab) of Paradise. This interpretation is more clear. And Allah knows best.” (Sharh An-Nawawi, 13/38. 
The hadiths about the camels and horses to which An-Nawawi referred are as follows

It was narrated from Abu Ayyub that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The people of Paradise will visit one another on white camels as if they are rubies, and there are no animals in Paradise apart from camels and birds.” (Narrated by At-Tabarani in Al-Kabir, 4/179)

Al-Haythami said: “This was narrated by At-Tabarani. Its isnad includes Jabir ibn Nuh who is weak. Majma` Az-Zawa’id, 10/413. It was also classed as weak by Al-Albani in Da`if Al-Jami`, 1833.” 

It was narrated from Sulayman ibn Buraydah from his father that a man asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “O Messenger of Allah, will there be horses in Paradise?” He said, “If Allah admits you to Paradise, you will not wish that you could be carried on a horse of red rubies which will fly wherever you want in Paradise, but that will happen.” And another man asked him, “O Messenger of Allah, will there be camels in Paradise?” but he did not say something like he had said to his companion. He said, “If Allah admits you to Paradise, you will have therein whatever your heart desires and will delight your eyes.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 2543. Classed as hasan by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Targhib, 3/522.)

A similar report was also narrated by Abu Ayyub from At-Tirmidhi, 2544; and also classed as sahih by Al-Albani, 3/423. 
And it was narrated in authentic hadiths that the souls of the martyrs are in the crops of birds in Paradise which fly wherever they want. 
It should be noted that the birds, horses and camels in Paradise are not the same as those in this world; they resemble them in name only. What they are really like is known only to Allah. But we know that they are extremely beautiful, because they are one of the delights that Allah has prepared for His close friends in Paradise. This was indicated by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the hadith quoted above, in which it says that the horses of Paradise are of red rubies, and will fly with their rider wherever he wants. 
We ask Allah to bless us and admit us to Paradise by His mercy, for He is the Most Generous.

    be in (a way) that is better (with good words and in good manner, inviting 
    them to Islamic Monotheism with His Verses)”

14422,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14422,Keeping pets,Is it haram to keep Pet fish? and also I heard somewhere that the dog was created from the dirt taken from the area of the belly button where Satan spat on Adam (AS)?,,,"Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with keeping animals for which there is no Islamic prohibition on keeping them (such as dogs and pigs). There are reports in the Sunnah which indicate that some of the Sahaabah kept permissible animals for farming purposes or for fun and for pleasure. 
It was narrated from Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) that he had a young brother who had a nughar (a small bird or nightingale). The bird died, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw him looking sad and grieved, so he joked with him, and said to him words which implied approval of his keeping this bird. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him, “O Abu Umayr, what happened to the nughayr?” 
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told us that a woman entered Hell because of a cat “which she did not feed, neither did she let it eat from the vermin of the earth.” From this it may be understood that if she had fed it, she would have been saved from that threat. 
And it was said that Abu Hurayrah was so called because of a cat (hirr, dim. hurayrah) which used to accompany him. 
So keeping permissible animals, so long as you do not neglect them, is something which is permitted and it may even be one of the means of earning reward, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “In every living being there is reward.” But if you keep animals and neglect and abuse them, it may be one of the means that lead to sin and the threat of Hell, as in the hadeeth about the woman who neglected her cat until it died. 
We would also like to point out that Islam preceded both western and eastern organizations in proclaiming the rights of women, animals, workers, employers and so on. Indeed, the greatest rights which it proclaimed are the rights of Allah over His creation and the rights of people over Allah. 
We would also point out that care and concern for human beings should take precedence over the care of animals, and that the reward for that is greater. [The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:] “Ward off the Fire even with half a date [i.e., by giving half a date in charity]” and “I and the one who sponsors an orphan will be like these two in Paradise” – and he gestured with his index finger and the one next to it. And there are other similar ahaadeeth from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
On this basis, there is nothing wrong with your keeping fish as you mentioned in your question, so long as you take care of feeding them and avoiding anything that could cause their death. And Allah knows best. 
With regard to the creation of dogs, Allah created them as He created all other animals; it is not permissible to claim that dogs were created from any specific substance without having evidence for that. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and we testify not except according to what we know”[Yoosuf 12:81]
With regard to Iblees, Allah commanded him to prostrate to Adam and he refused and was arrogant, then what he did was to tempt Adam to eat from the tree from which he had been forbidden to eat. There was no kind of dirt, and Allah knows best. I do not know anything of the argument which you mentioned. 
One aspect of the Qur’aanic guidance is that it mentioned the knowledge which the Muslim needs in this world and in the Hereafter; with regard to knowledge for which there is no need, the Qur’aan does not mention it, so as to teach the Muslims to focus on beneficial knowledge and to ignore everything else. For example, the Qur’aanic text does not mention the colour of the dog which belonged to the People of the Cave, or the kind of wood from which the ship (ark) of Nooh was built, and other matters which are irrelevant and produce no beneficial knowledge or belief. Perhaps speaking of the substance from which dogs were created comes under the same heading.

14488,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14488,Ruling on representing the Sahaabah in plays etc.,"I had a disagreement with someone about the representation of the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in movies and plays, as happens a great deal nowadays. He said that this serves an interest, calling people to Islam and spreading noble Islamic morals and attitudes. What is your opinion on this matter?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The Sahaabah have a high status in Islam, because they were the contemporaries of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him); they fulfilled the duty of supporting him and being loyal to him, and they strove for the sake of Allah with their efforts, their wealth and their selves. Hence the scholars are agreed that they are the elite and the best of this ummah, and that Allah gave them the honour of being the companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). He praised them in His Book when He said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. And those who are with him are severe against disbelievers, and merciful among themselves. You see them bowing and falling down prostrate (in prayer), seeking Bounty from Allah and (His) Good Pleasure. The mark of them (i.e. of their Faith) is on their faces (foreheads) from the traces of prostration (during prayers)”[al-Fath 48:29]
And the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) praised them when he said: “The best of my ummah is my generation, then those who come after them, then those who come after them.” (al-Bukhaari, 3650; Muslim, 2535) 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) warned against belittling them, mocking them or insulting them when he said: “Whoever insults my companions, the curse of Allah, the angels and all of mankind will be upon him.” (al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 2340). 
Portraying any one of them on stage or on the screen is contrary to this praise from Allah, and is detrimental to the high status and honour which Allah has bestowed upon them. That is because representing any one of them in this fashion exposes them to mockery and ridicule. Actors are usually people who have no room for righteousness, piety and Islamic morals in their lives. Moreover those who put on plays are doing that as a means to earn money, and no matter how much they try to avoid it, it will involve some lying and backbiting. 
Representing the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) has an effect on their status in the hearts and minds of the Muslims, and paves the way for Muslims to doubt their religion. It also necessarily implies that one of the actors will play the role of Abu Jahl or one of his ilk among the kuffaar, and he will have to utter words insulting Bilaal, and insulting the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the message of Islam that he brought. Undoubtedly this is a great evil. 
What is said about this serving the interest of calling people to Islam and spreading noble Islamic morals and etiquette is simply an assumption and wishful thinking. Whoever knows the real nature and aims of actors will realize that this kind of acting is in sharp contrast to the real nature of the actors and their audience. 
One of the basic principles in Islamic sharee’ah is that if a matter both serves an interest and does some harm, if the bad outweighs the good then it is haraam. Representing the Sahaabah may serve some interest but the harm done by this is far greater than any good that might be achieved. 
So in order to protect those interests and ward off the harm, and to preserve the honorable status of the companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), we must not allow that. 
Based on the above, it is haraam to represent any of the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in movies or plays etc. 
And Allah knows best. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and all his family and companions.","Al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, in Majallah al-Buhooth al-Islamiyyah, 1/223-248"
14490,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14490,The kaafir’s reckoning in the Hereafter,"The believer will face his reckoning on the Day of Resurrection, whether his deeds are good or bad. But how will the reckoning of the kaafir be, when he is not required to observe the same duties as the believer?",,,"Praise be to Allah.This question is based on a misconception, for the same requirements are demanded of the kaafir as of the believer, but he is not obliged to do them in this world. The indication that he is subject to the same requirements is to be found in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):
“Except those on the Right (i.e. the pious true believers of Islamic Monotheism).
In Gardens (Paradise) they will ask one another,
About Al‑Mujrimoon (polytheists, criminals, disbelievers) (and they will say to them):
‘What has caused you to enter Hell’
They will say: ‘We were not of those who used to offer the Salaah (prayers),
Nor we used to feed Al‑Miskeen (the poor);
And we used to talk falsehood (all that which Allah hated) with vain talkers.
And we used to belie the Day of Recompense’” [al-Muddaththir 74:39-46]
If their suffering were not due to the fact that they did not pray or feed the poor, they would not mention these things. This indicates that they will be punished concerning (neglect of) the minor issues of Islam. This is based on the texts but it is also the matter of common sense, for if Allah will punish His believing slave for what he failed to do with regard to religious obligations, how can He not punish His disbelieving slave? Rather I could add that the kaafir will be punished for everything that Allah has blessed him with in this world, his food, drink, etc. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Those who believe and do righteous good deeds, there is no sin on them for what they ate (in the past), if they fear Allah (by keeping away from His forbidden things), and believe and do righteous good deeds, and again fear Allah and believe, and once again fear Allah and do good deeds with Ihsaan (perfection). And Allah loves the good‑doers” [al-Maa'idah 5:93]
The apparent meaning of the aayah is that the believers are relieved of any blame for what they eat, and it may be understood that the kaafirs are to blame for what they eat. Similarly Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Say (O Muhammad): ‘Who has forbidden the adornment with clothes given by Allah, which He has produced for His slaves, and At-Tayyibaat [all kinds of Halaal (lawful) things] of food?’ Say: ‘They are, in the life of this world, for those who believe, (and) exclusively for them (believers) on the Day of Resurrection (the disbelievers will not share them)’” [al-A’raaf 7:32]
The phrase “They are, in the life of this world, for those who believe” indicates that people other than the believers do not have any right to enjoy them. I say that they do not have any shar’i right to them, but the reality of this life is that Allah has created these things and the kaafirs are benefitting from them, and this is something that cannot be denied. This indicates that the kaafir will be brought to account even for the permissible things that he ate and for what he wore. This is based on the texts but it is also the matter of common sense, for how can it make sense that this kaafir who disobeys Allah and does not believe in Him should have the right to enjoy that which Allah has created and blessed His slaves with? If this is clear to you, (then you will see that) the kaafir will be brought to account on the Day of Resurrection for his deeds, but the way in which the kaafir will be brought to account will not be like the way in which the believer is brought to account, because the reckoning of the believer will be easy, and his Lord will speak to him alone, and will make him admit to his sins, then He will say to him, “I concealed your sins in the world and I forgive you for them today.” But as for the kaafir – we seek refuge with Allah – his reckoning will mean that he will confess to his sins and be humiliated before all the people,  
“and the witnesses will say, “These are the ones who lied against their Lord!” No doubt! the Curse of Allah is on the Zaalimoon (polytheists, wrongdoers, oppressors)”","From the fatwas of Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, in Kitaab Fataawa Islaamiyyah, 1/82"
