40111,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/40111,Doing righteous deeds when one is careless about prayer,"In the past I did not pray regularly. I would pray for a few days, then stop for a few days, then go back to praying. I used to give a lot of charity, seeking the pleasure of Allaah, and I upheld the ties of kinship, doing that only for the sake of Allaah. Will the good deeds I did be rejected because my prayers were incomplete, or might Allaah accept them if He wills?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Negligence in performing prayers is a great sin, and a sign of extreme negligence, 
    because prayer  is the most important pillar of Islam after the Shahaadatayn (twin testimony of faith). Allaah warns those who take the matter of 
    prayer lightly and do not pray on time, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Then, there has succeeded them a posterity who have given up As-Salaat (the 
    prayers) [i.e. made their Salaat (prayers) to be lost, either by not offering them or by not offering them perfectly or by not offering them in 
    their proper fixed times] and have followed lusts. So they will be thrown in Hell.
Except those who repent and believe (in the Oneness of Allaah and His Messenger 
    Muhammad), and work righteousness. Such will enter Paradise and they will not be wronged in aught”
[Maryam 19:59, 60] 
A number of scholars were of the view that the one who misses a single prayer and delays it 
    until its time is over, with no excuse, is a kaafir. So what you have to do is to repent to Allaah from this great sin, and pray regularly on 
    time, as well as doing a lot of naafil prayers, in the hope that Allaah will forgive you and accept your good deeds. 
It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (Fatwas of the Standing 
    Committee), 6/50: 
Question: 
Four years ago we went on a pleasure trip. During this trip I missed a prayer – 
    either Zuhr or ‘Asr, I can’t remember now – because I was being careless and lazy. Now I regret the sin that I committed and I ask Allaah to 
    forgive me for every sin. What do I have to do, and is there any expiation? 
The Standing Committee replied: 
You have to repent to Allaah sincerely, but you do not have to make up the prayer 
    you missed, because deliberately missing an obligatory prayer is major kufr [disbelief], as the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “The covenant that stands between us and them is prayer; whoever gives up prayer is a kaafir.” And he  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “Between a man and kufr and shirk there stands his giving up prayer.” Narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh. There is 
    no expiation for that but sincere repentance. 
Secondly: 
The good deeds of a kaafir are of no avail before Allaah unless he becomes Muslim, 
    then his good deeds will benefit him and their reward will be written for him, as it says clearly in al-Saheehayn, where it is narrated 
    that Hakeem ibn Hizaam (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: 
I said, “O Messenger of Allaah, there are some things that I used to do as acts of worship 
    during the Jaahiliyyah, such as giving charity, freeing slaves and upholding the ties of kinship. Will I get any reward for that?” The Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “You entered Islam with the good that you had done before.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1436; 
    Muslim, 123. 
Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
Ibn Battaal and other scholars were of the view that the apparent meaning of this 
    hadeeth indicates that if a kaafir becomes Muslim and dies in Islam, he will be rewarded for the good deeds that he did when he was still a 
    kaafir. They quoted as evidence the hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When a kaafir enters Islam and becomes a good Muslim, Allaah records for him all the good deeds that 
    he had done previously, and erases thereby between ten and seven hundred (bad deeds) the like thereof, and each bad deed will only count as one, 
    unless Allaah forgives him.” It was mentioned by al-Daaraqutni in Ghareeb Hadeeth Maalik, and narrated from him through nine isnaads, in 
    all of which it states that if a kaafir becomes a good Muslim, every good deed that he did when he was still a mushrik will be recorded for him. 
Ibn Battaal (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, after mentioning the hadeeth: Allaah may 
    bestow His bounty upon His slaves as much as He wills, and no one can question Him for that. This is like what the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to Hakeem ibn Hizaam (may Allaah be pleased with him): “You entered Islam with the good that you had done 
    before.”  And Allaah knows best. 
With regard to the words of the fuqaha’: “The worship of a kaafir is not valid, 
    and if he enters Islam it will not count,” what they meant is that it is not subject to shar’i rulings in this world, and there is no expectation 
    (at the time of doing it) of reward in the Hereafter, but if someone suggests that if he becomes Muslim he will not be rewarded for his good deeds 
    in the Hereafter, then that view should be refuted by referring to this saheeh Sunnah.

Please note that there are only two of us praying.,"Congregational prayer is obligatory for healthy men in the mosque, according to the more correct scholarly opinion.","Praying in congregation 


Congregational prayer in the mosque","Praise be to Allah.Praying in congregation 
Prayer in congregation is obligatory for healthy men in the mosque, according to the more correct scholarly opinion. This is based on a great deal of evidence, including the following: 

Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“When you (O Messenger Muhammad) are among them, and lead them in As-Salah (the prayer), let one party of them stand up [in Salah (prayer)] with you taking their arms with them; when they finish their prostrations, let them take their positions in the rear and let the other party come up which have not yet prayed, and let them pray with you” [al-Nisa 4:102]
The following points are made on the basis of this verse: 
Allah commands them to pray in congregation, then He repeats this command a second time with regard to the second party or group, as He says, “and let the other party come up which have not yet prayed, and let them pray with you”. This indicates that prayer in congregation is an obligation for all individuals, because Allah did not absolve the second group of this obligation as a result of the first group praying in congregation.
If prayer in congregation was Sunnah, it would be more appropriate for people to be excused from it at times of fear [the situation referred to in this verse], and if it were fard kifayah (a communal obligation), it would be discharged by the actions of the first group. So this verse shows that it is an individual obligation, and demonstrates that in three ways: it is enjoined at the beginning, then it is enjoined a second time, and there is no concession allowing them not to do it at times of fear. (From the words of Ibn al-Qayyim in Kitab al-Salah) 

In al-Sahihayn (the following version was narrated by al-Bukhari) it is narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, I had thought of ordering that wood be gathered, then I would command the call to prayer to be given, and I would appoint a man to lead the people in prayer, then I would go to men [who do not attend the congregational prayer] and burn their houses down around them. By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, if any of you had known that he would receive a bone covered with meat or two (small) pieces of meat in a sheep’s foot, he would come for 'Isha prayer.” (Al-Bukhari, 7224; Muslim, 651) 

Ibn al-Mundhir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The fact that he was thinking of burning down the houses of people who did not attend the prayer is the clearest evidence that attending prayer in congregation is obligatory, because it would not be permissible for the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to do this with regard to something that was mustahabb and not obligatory.” (Al-Awsat, 4/134) 
For more information on the evidence, please see question no. 8918 . 
Congregational prayer in the mosque 
Once it is established that prayer in congregation is obligatory, it is obligatory to perform this prayer in the mosque. It is not permissible for a man who is able to attend the congregational prayer in the mosque to pray in his house even if he prays in congregation with his family. 
Shaykh Ibn Baz said: 
“With regard to not praying in congregation, this is a reprehensible action and is not permitted. It is also one of the attributes of the hypocrites. 
It is obligatory for the Muslim to pray in the mosque in congregation, as it says in the hadith of Ibn Umm Makhtum – who was a blind man. He said, “O Messenger of Allah, I do not have a guide to lead me to the mosque,” and he asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to grant him a concession allowing him to pray in his house, and he allowed him that, but when he turned away he called him back and asked, “Can you hear the call to prayer?” He said, “Yes.” He said, “Then answer it.” Narrated by Muslim in his Sahih, 635. 
And it was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever hears the call to prayer and does not come, there is no prayer for him [i.e., his prayer is not valid], unless he has an excuse.” Narrated by Ibn Majah, al-Daraqutni, Ibn Hibban and al-Hakim with a sahih isnad. It was said to Ibn 'Abbas, what is an excuse? He said, Fear or sickness. 
In Sahih Muslim (654) it is narrated that Ibn Mas’ud said: “At the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) we used to think that no one failed to attend the prayer in congregation but a hypocrite or one who was sick.” 
What is meant is that the believer is required to pray in the mosque, and it is not permissible for him to take the matter lightly and pray in his house when the mosque is nearby. 
The fact that only two men pray in the mosque reinforces the fact that you have to attend the congregational prayer, so as to be free of any sin or shortcoming, and so as to encourage them to attend the prayer in congregation in the mosque, so that they will not get lazy. Two or more people constitutes a congregation. 
Ibn Hubayrah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “[The scholars] were unanimously agreed that the smallest number that counts for prayer in congregation, apart from Jumu’ah prayer, is two: the imam and the person who is praying behind him, who should stand to his right.” (Al-Ifsah, 1/155) 
Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “A congregation may consist of two or more , and we know of no difference of opinion concerning that.”

40126,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/40126,Does Preventing Oneself From Ejaculation Require Ghusl?,"What is the ruling if a man holds his penis just before ejaculation and prevents anything coming out, does he have to do Ghusl? If he does the same thing but after a while he notices that a few small drops have come out, what is the ruling?","If a man feels the semen moving when he feels desire without intercourse, and he holds his penis and nothing comes out, then he does not have to do Ghusl according to the majority of scholars. If intercourse takes place, then Ghusl becomes obligatory even if there is no ejaculation.","Does preventing ejaculation require Ghusl?


Is Ghusl required after intercourse without ejaculation?","Praise be to Allah.Does preventing ejaculation require Ghusl?
If a man feels the semen moving when he feels desire without intercourse, and he holds his penis and nothing comes out, then he does not have to do Ghusl according to the majority of scholars; this is unlike the well-known view of Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him. 
Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If a man feels the semen moving when he feels desire without intercourse, and he holds his penis and nothing comes out, then he does not have to do Ghusl. This is the view of most of the jurists.  
This is because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) connected Ghusl to seeing and the gushing of semen, as he said: “If you see water (semen)” and “if water (semen) gushes out then do Ghusl.” So the ruling does not apply otherwise. (Al-Mughni, 1/128)
An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“If a man kisses a woman and feels the semen moving, and he holds his penis and nothing comes out at that moment, and he does not notice anything coming out afterwards, then he does not have to do Ghusl in our view. 
This was the view of all the scholars except Ahmad, who said – according to the better known of the two views narrated from him – that he has to do Ghusl, because it is impossible to imagine semen going back. 
The evidence for that is the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Water (Ghusl) is only for water (semen).” And because the scholars unanimously agreed that whoever feels some rumbling or wind in his stomach, but nothing has come out of him, he does not have to do Wudu. This is a similar matter.” (Al-Majmu`, 2/159) 
The view of the majority of scholars is the one which is more correct, because of the evidence that they quoted. 
It should be noted that this action – preventing semen from coming out – is very harmful. 
Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Can semen move without coming out? 
Yes it can, when a person holds his penis so that it does not come out, or when his desire suddenly drops. Even though the jurists discussed this, it is very harmful. The jurists (may Allah have mercy on him) may discuss an idea whether it is permissible or prohibited. Some of the scholars said that Ghusl is not required if the semen moves. This is the view favoured by Shaykh Al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah], and this is the correct view.” (Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti`, 1/280)
But when semen comes out, then Ghusl is obligatory , even if what comes out is just one drop. 
From this it is known that there is no difference of scholarly opinion concerning the fact that Ghusl becomes obligatory when semen is emitted , if that is as a result of desire and it comes out gushing. This applies to one who holds his penis when the semen moves, then he cannot control it and one or more drops of semen come out, even if that is after a while. (See Al-Mughni, 1/268)
The Standing Committee was asked about the emission of a single drop of semen as the result of desire. They replied as follows: 
“If the semen is comes out gushing as the result of desire, this means that Ghusl is required even if what comes out is just one drop, and without intercourse. Wudu is not sufficient, rather what is required is Ghusl from major impurity . (Fatawa Al-Lajnah, 5/202) 
Is Ghusl required after intercourse without ejaculation?
If intercourse takes place, then Ghusl becomes obligatory even if there is no ejaculation , because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When the two circumcised parts meet and the tip of the penis disappears, then Ghusl becomes obligatory, whether ejaculation takes place or not .” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Al-Jami`, 379)

Question: Is the Ibaadi sect regarded as one of the misguided sects of the 
    Khaarijis, and is it permissible to pray behind them? 
The Committee answered as follows: 
The Ibaadis are one of the misguided sects because of their aggression and 
    rebellion against ‘Uthmaan ibn ‘Affaan and ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with them both), and it is not permissible to pray behind them. 
And Allaah is the Source of strength.

We cannot find any statement by Shaykh Ibn Baaz to the effect that this group are kaafirs. 
See the ruling on praying behind a Shi’i in the answer to question no.
    20093. 
It is not permissible to allow the followers of innovation that constitutes kufr 
    to lead the prayers, because prayers offered behind them are not valid according to a number of scholars, and because they deserve to be forsaken 
    and rebuked, not put forward for positions of leadership, and because allowing them to lead the prayer may lead to the ignorant being deceived by 
    them. 
Innovations that constitute kufr include such things as saying that the Qur’aan is 
    created, denying that the believers will see their Lord in Paradise, saying that those who commit major sins are kaafirs or will abide in Hell for 
    eternity, denouncing Abu Bakr and ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with them) as kaafirs, saying that the Qur’aan has been altered, claiming that the 
    imams have knowledge of the unseen, seeking the help of the dead, and other forms of kufr and shirk. 
This is contrast to one who follows an innovation that does not constitute kufr; prayer 
    offered behind such a person is valid. 
The following question was mentioned in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah 
    (7/364): 
Is it permissible to pray behind an imam who follows innovation? 
The Committee replied: 
Whoever can find an imam who does not follow innovation, let him pray behind him 
    and not the one who follows innovation. Whoever cannot find anyone but the one who follows innovation, let him advise him in the hope that he will 
    give up the bid’ah (innovation). If he does not accept that and his innovation involves shirk – such as one who seeks the help of the dead or 
    prays to them instead of Allaah or offers sacrifices to them – then you should not pray behind him because he is a kaafir and his prayer is 
    invalid, and it is not proper to make him an imam. If his bid’ah does not constitute kufr, such as speaking the intention out loud, then his 
    prayer and the prayer of those who pray behind him is still valid.

40150,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/40150,He offers all the obligatory prayers in the mosque except for Fajr. What is the ruling on that?,"I offer all the obligatory prayers in the mosque, praise be to Allah, except for Fajr, which I pray at home. Is that permissible?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.You should note that Allah has blessed you by enabling you to offer the prayers in the mosque with the congregation, to stand before Allah in His house and establish this great ritual of Islam and to do that which Allah has enjoined upon you. There is nothing that is more beloved to Allah than fulfilment of what He has enjoined. We have already discussed the obligation of praying in congregation in question no. 8918. 
With regard to what you say about praying Fajr in your house, this is a sin for which you must repent to Allah, and it is a problem from which you are suffering and we ask Allah to help you to overcome it. That is because the evidence which indicates that it is obligatory to pray in congregation does not apply only to some prayers and not others, rather it is general in meaning and applies to all the prayers, the first of which is Fajr, about which you are asking. 
How can you feel comfortable about not praying Fajr in congregation and depriving yourself of complete light on the Day of Resurrection? Abu Dawood (561), al-Tirmidhi (223) and Ibn Maajah (781) narrated from Buraydah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Give glad tidings to those who walk to the mosques in the dark, of perfect light on the Day of Resurrection.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Targheeb. 
How can you feel comfortable about not praying Fajr in congregation and depriving yourself of meeting the angels and their testifying for you before your Lord? Al-Bukhaari (555) and Muslim (632) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Angels come to you in succession, night and day, and they meet at Fajr prayer and ‘Asr prayer, then those who stayed among you overnight ascend and [Allah] asks them – although He knows better about them – ‘How did you leave My slaves?’ and they say, ‘We left them when they were praying and we came to them when they were praying.’” 
How can you feel comfortable about not praying Fajr in congregation and depriving yourself of the reward of spending half the night in prayer? Muslim narrated in his Saheeh (656) that ‘Uthmaan (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “Whoever prays ‘Isha’ in congregation, it is as if he spent half the night in prayer, and whoever prays Fajr in congregation, it is as if he spent the whole night in prayer.” 
According to a report narrated by Abu Dawood (555) and al-Tirmidhi (221): “Whoever prays ‘Isha’ in congregation, it is as if he spent half the night in prayer, and whoever prays ‘Isha’ and Fajr in congregation, it is as if he spent the (whole) night in prayer.” 
How can you feel comfortable about not praying Fajr in congregation and depriving yourself of the protection of Allah? It was narrated that Abu Bakrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever prays Fajr with the congregation will be under the protection of Allah, and whoever violates this protection of Allah, Allah will throw him into the Fire on his face.” Al-Haythami said in Majma’ al-Zawaa’id: This was narrated by al-Tabaraani in al-Kabeer in a hadeeth; this is its wording and its men are the men of saheeh; it was also classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Targheeb. 
The origin of this hadeeth is in Saheeh Muslim, in the chapter entitled The virtue of praying ‘Isha’ and Fajr in congregation (657). “Whoever violates the protection of Allah,” means by harming and offending the believer who prayed Fajr in congregation. 
How can you feel comfortable about not praying Fajr in congregation when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has told us that feeling that it is too burdensome to pray Fajr in congregation is the sign of the hypocrites? Al-Bukhaari (657) and Muslim (651) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The most burdensome of prayers for the hypocrites are ‘Isha’ and Fajr. If only they knew what (reward) there is in them, they would come to them even if they had to crawl. I was thinking of ordering that the call to prayer be given, then I would tell a man to lead the people in prayer, then I would set out with some men carrying bundles of wood and go to people who do not attend the prayer, and burn their houses down with them inside.” 
‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “When we noticed that a man was not present at Fajr and ‘Isha’ prayer, we would think badly of him.” Narrated by al-Haakim in al-Mustadrak, 764, and elsewhere; he classed it as saheeh according to the conditions of the two shaykhs (al-Bukhari and Muslim), and al-Dhahabi and al-Albani agreed with him. 
The Muslim who is keen to attend the prayers in congregation, as you describe yourself, would not feel comfortable, in sha Allah, to miss praying Fajr in congregation, after hearing what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said about that.

40156,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/40156,There is no zakah on an’aam animals unless they graze on pasture with no expenditure on their food,Is zakah due on sheep that do not graze and money is spent monthly on buying food for them? Is there any zakah on sheep that graze on pasture and herbage and nothing is spent on food for them? I hope that you can explain.,,,"Praise be to Allah.The majority of scholars, including the three imams Abu Haneefah, al-Shaafa’i and Ahmad, are of the view that zakah is not due on an’aam animals (camels, cattle and sheep) unless they graze on pasture and their owner does not feed them. If they are fed [with food that is bought for them] then there is no zakah on them. 
They quoted several texts as evidence, including the following: 
1 – The report narrated by al-Bukhaari (1454) from Anas, that Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) wrote him the following letter when he sent him to Bahrain: “In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. This is the obligation of zakah which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoined on the Muslims and which Allah enjoined upon His Messenger. Whoever among the Muslims is asked to pay it in the proper manner, let him give it and whoever is asked for more than that, let him not give more … With regard to the zakah on sheep in the pasture, if they number between forty and one hundred and twenty, one sheep (is due as zakah)…” 
The fact that the word ghanam (sheep) is further defined by their being described as being in the pasture indicates that there is no zakah on those that are not in the pasture. 
2 – The report narrated by al-Nasaa’i (2444) from Bahz ibn Hakeem from his father, from his grandfather who said: I heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “For grazing camels, for every forty an ibnat laboon (a two-year old she-camel)…” Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel, 791. 
The fact that the word ibl (camels) is further defined by describing them as grazing indicates that there is no zakah on other kinds. 
Cattle come under the same ruling as camels and sheep. 
See al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 5/33 
Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmoo’: 
The fact that it is limited to those that are grazing is regarded as evidence in our view. Grazing means those that graze in the pasture and are not fed. 
Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni: 
The fact that grazing animals are specifically mentioned excludes those that are fed, on which no zakah is due according to the majority of scholars. 
Maalik was of the view that zakah is due on all an’aam animals whether they are grazing or non-grazing. He quoted as evidence for that the fact that in some ahaadeeth the word ibl (camels) in used in a general sense and is not defined as those that are grazing, as in the letter of Abu Bakr to Anas (may Allah be pleased with them both) in which it says: “With regard to twenty-four camels or less, for every five one sheep (is to be given as zakah).”  
The majority of scholars responded to this deduction by stating that this hadith is general in meaning, and that the other ahaadeeth define (the animals) as those that graze. The basic principle here is that the general should be interpreted in light of the specific. 
They supported this by saying: 
With regard to the zakah on an’aam animals, it is connected to the idea of growth and multiplication. This is obvious with regard to grazing animals, because there is no cost involved in looking after them. With regard to animals that are fed, there is a cost involved in looking after them, and that cost may be equal to any growth (in their numbers or weight). Thus the wisdom and mercy of Allah dictated that zakah should be waived unless the (grazing) animals are prepared for the purpose of trade, such as when one buys animals then looks after them and feeds them in order to fatten them for sale. In that case they come under the heading of trade goods and thus are subject to zakah. 
al-Mughni, 4/12; al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 23/250. 
For more information on how to calculate the zakah on trade goods, see question no.  10823. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in Majmoo’ al-Fatawa (32/32): 
The words in this hadith, “for grazing sheep” represent an area concerning which there is some scholarly difference of opinion. The view of Maalik is that working camels and oxen, and rams that are fed, are subject to zakah. Abu ‘Umar said: This is also the view of al-Layth, but I do not know of anyone who said it apart from them. With regard to al-Shaafa’i, Ahmad and Abu Haneefah, and also al-Thawri, al-Awzaa’i and others, in their view no zakah is due on these animals. This was narrated from a number of the Sahaabah: ‘Ali, Jabir, and Mu’aadh ibn Jabal. ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez also wrote a letter to this effect, and it was narrated in the hadith of Bahz ibn Hakeem from his father, from his grandfather, from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), that he said: “For all grazing livestock, for every forty a two-year-old she camel (bint laboon).” So it was limited to grazing livestock, and other general reports should be interpreted in the light of specific reports, when both are speaking of the same type of animals, and there is no dispute among the scholars concerning this matter. The same may be noted concerning the hadith of Abu Bakr about grazing sheep. 
It says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 9/205: 
One of the conditions of zakah being due on camels, cattle and sheep is that they should be grazing.

Returning the money now may cause some problems for me and my family, especially since my family and I are still in touch with the owners of the company. What should I do? 
Can I send the money to them via mail without mentioning my name, just writing a letter which says that this money was taken from them unlawfully?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.We praise Allah for having enabled you to repent. It is well known that money is the fitnah (trial) of this ummah, so being enabled to repent from having taken people’s money unlawfully is a great blessing for which you must always thank Allah. 
In order to make your repentance complete you have to return the money to its owners. It is good that you are asking this question. We have already discussed this matter in our answer to question no. 31234, in which it stated that the one who wants to return property to its rightful owners does not have to disclose his identity to them, because the purpose is to restore the property to its rightful owner, not to know who the thief is. 
Hence you should look for a suitable way by means of which you can preserve your dignity whilst also returning the property to its rightful owners without embarrassing yourself in front of the owners of this company.

40163,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/40163,Problem With Son Masturbating Daily,"I am the mother of an only child, a seven year old boy, and recently I found him practicing the secret habit (masturbation). Every time I ask him if he did it today he tells me, quite frankly, yes. I forbade him to do this haraam (unlawful) action, then I started to take away some privileges and even hit him, but with no success. He is still doing it every day, maybe even more than once. I got tired of keeping an eye on him, and I feel ashamed before Allaah that this sin may stay with him until he grows up, and he may persist in not repenting, so he will get used to sin and regard it as insignificant, and so his heart will become deadened when he is still young.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The family is often responsible for the children falling into sin, because they do not urge children to worship Allaah and they make available the means of falling into sin. 
We do not know what is really happening here, but it may be that the circumstances surrounding this boy have made him fall into sin. He is an only child, and an only child is usually spoiled, which makes the means of falling into sin readily available. This problem may be dealt with in a number of ways: 
1 – Reducing the extent to which he is spoiled, because spoiling him makes him feel that he is not a man, so he tries to prove that he is a man by means of this habit or smoking, for example. 
2 – Not making the means of falling into sin available, especially those which contribute to deadening of the heart, such as giving him music tapes to listen to and providing satellite channels for him to watch. 
3 – Try not to let the child sleep alone or close the door when he is asleep, because being alone makes it easy to think about sin and encourages one to do it. 
4 – Making the child feel attached to the mosque and its study circles, and to righteous friends. These are the greatest means of helping a person to correct his ways and strengthen his faith. 
5 – Providing a useful Islamic audio-visual library, which will create in him a love for worship, teach him good manners and deter him from falling into sin. 
6- Encouraging him to read, especially books that have to do with biographies of the scholars and heroic mujaahideen (warriors). Perhaps he will acquire some of their attributes and follow in their footsteps. It is better to encourage him to write a summary of what he reads, hears and watches, and to give him a suitable reward for that. 
7 – Encourage him to memorize Qur’aan and fast; undoubtedly these will strengthen him spiritually. 
8 –Try to organize his time so that he will be active during the day and will sleep early, because staying up late may make him think at length about sin. 
9 – Explain to him the shar’i (Islamic law) ruling on this habit and its effect on the mind, heart and faculties. 
10 – Avoid humiliating him, hitting him and embarrassing him, because hitting him, humiliating him and embarrassing him will not make him give up this sin and others like it, rather you should deal with him in the way that is best and by giving him good advice.

40179,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/40179,He is being asked to denounce evil by e-mail,"Recently we have discovered that some of the enemies of Islam are insulting Islam and saying bad things about the Messenger of Allaah Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), either in words or in drawings – may Allaah curse them. Sometimes news of this comes to us in e-mails and the Muslims are asked to denounce these evils either by sending e-mails or by ordinary mail or by letting the evildoer know how the Muslims feel. My question is: if we do not carry out this denunciation are we sinning? Or if some people do it will the others be absolved of responsibility?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: the basic principle is that denunciation of evil is 
    a fard kafaayah (communal obligation), so if sufficient people undertake it, 
    the rest are absolved of sin. 

    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his 
    commentary on Saheeh Muslim: 
Enjoining what is good 
    and forbidding what is evil is fard kafaayah (communal obligation); if some 
    people do it then the rest are absolved of sin, but if no one  does it, 
    everyone who was able to do it with no excuse or fear (but did not do it) is 
    guilty of sin. But it may also be an individual obligation, such as if a 
    person is in a situation where no one else knows of it but him, or no one 
    can remove it but him, or such as if a man sees his wife, child or slave 
    committing an evil action or failing to do something good. End quote. 

    But we must not forget the obligation of enjoining what is 
    good and forbidding what is evil. The Muslims should do that, because the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever 
    among you sees an evil action, let him change it with his hand (by taking 
    action); if he cannot then with his tongue (by speaking out); and if he 
    cannot then with his heart (by hating it and feeling that it is wrong), and 
    that is the weakest of faith.” Narrated by Muslim, 49. 

    This becomes more important the worse the evil action is, and 
    there is no evil action worse than insulting Allaah and His religion Islam, 
    or insulting His Messenger Muhammad  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him). 

    Whoever comes across any of these evil actions, in a 
    newspaper or magazine, or on a satellite channel or elsewhere has to 
    denounce it as much as he can, with his hand (by taking action), with his 
    tongue (by speaking out) or with his heart (by hating it), as enjoined by 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 

    Whoever does not see it or come across it, but is told of it 
    by others, should also hasten to denounce it, by getting in touch with the 
    newspaper or channel, or getting in touch with the writer of the article 
    himself, and denouncing them. If people see how many are denouncing it they 
    will be deterred from repeating the evil action, and they may even apologize 
    publicly and repent. 

    Moreover, if many people agree on denouncing an evil action, 
    that will be indicative of the power of the religious people, and their 
    protective jealousy and their awareness of what is being broadcast and 
    published. This is something that is required by sharee’ah, otherwise you 
    will find that every day someone dares to say something bad about Islam. 

    Moreover, this is a means of earning reward, for the one who 
    denounces evil will be rewarded. 

    We ask Allaah to make our religion prevail and to humiliate 
    the people of deviance and misguidance. And Allaah knows best.",Islam Q&A
