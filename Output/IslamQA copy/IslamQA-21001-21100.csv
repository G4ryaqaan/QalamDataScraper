Please advise us, may Allaah reward you with good.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Yes, it is permissible for the latecomer who missed the prayer to follow one who is making up what he missed of the prayer with the original imaam, and the (second) imaam does not have to have the intention of leading the other in prayer.",Shaykh ‘Abd al-Kareem al-Khudayr
21018,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21018,The danger of rushing to issue fatwas,"There are some muftis on some satellite channels who answer all questions without exception. Some people in some gatherings, when a question is posed, rush to answer it and each of them wants to speak before the other. What is the Islamic ruling on this?",,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          Ibn al-Qayyim said: 
 
          The salaf, the Sahaabah and Taabi’een, used to regard 
          it as makrooh to rush to issue fatwas. Each of them would wish that 
          someone else would take care of it, but if he realized that he had no 
          alternative but to answer, he would do his utmost to find the ruling 
          from the Qur’aan and Sunnah or the words of the Rightly-Guided khaleefahs, 
          then he would give his fatwa. ‘Abd-Allaah ibn al-Mubaarak said: Sufyaan 
          told us from ‘Ataa’ ibn al-Saa’ib from ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Abi Layla 
          who said: I met one hundred and twenty of the Companions of the Messenger 
          of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) – and I think he said, in 
          the mosque – and there was none of them who had to speak but he wished 
          that his brother would take care of it; there was no one who had to 
          give a fatwa but he wished that his brother would take care of it. Imaam 
          Ahmad said: Jareer told us from ‘Ataa’ ibn al-Saa’ib from ‘Abd al-Rahmaan 
          ibn Abi Layla that he said: I met one hundred and twenty of the Ansaar 
          from among the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and there was no man among 
          them who was asked about something but he would wish that his brother 
          would take care of it, and there was none who had to speak but he would 
          wish that his brother would take care of it. 
 
          Maalik said, narrating from Yahya ibn Sa’eed that Bukayr 
          ibn al-Ashajj told him, narrating from Mu’aawiyah ibn Abi ‘Ayaash that 
          he was sitting with ‘Abd-Allaah ibn al-Zubayr and ‘Aasim ibn ‘Umar, 
          when Muhammad ibn Iyaas ibn al-Bukayr came and said, A man from among 
          the desert people has divorced his wife three times, what do you think? 
          ‘Abd-Allaah ibn al-Zubayr said, This matter is something about which 
          we know nothing; go to ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Abbaas and Abu Hurayrah, for 
          I have just left them with ‘Aa’ishah the wife of the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), then come and tell us (what 
          they say). So I went and asked them, and Ibn ‘Abbaas said to Abu Hurayrah: 
          Give him the answer, O Abu Hurayrah, for here there is a problem. Abu 
          Hurayrah said: one talaaq makes her divorced, and three makes her forbidden 
          to him until she has married another husband. 
 
          Maalik narrated that Yahyaa ibn Sa’eed said: Ibn ‘Abbaas 
          said: Everyone who issues fatwas to the people concerning everything 
          that they ask him about is crazy. Maalik said: I heard something similar 
          from Ibn Mas’ood. This was narrated by Ibn Waddaah from Yoosuf ibn ‘Adiy 
          from ‘Abd ibn Humayd from al-A’mash from Shaqeeq from ‘Abd-Allaah; and 
          it was narrated by Habeeb ibn Abi Thaabit from Abu Waa’il from ‘Abd-Allaah. 
 
          Sahnoon ibn Sa’eed said: the most audacious of the people 
          in giving fatwas is the one who has the least knowledge; a man may have 
          a grasp of one branch of knowledge and he thinks that all the truth 
          is to be found in this branch. 
 
          I say: being audacious in giving fatwas may be because 
          of a lack of knowledge or because of an abundance thereof. If he is 
          lacking in knowledge he gives a fatwa on everything concerning which 
          he is asked without knowledge. If his knowledge is abundant he will 
          be able to answer a lot of questions. Hence Ibn ‘Abbaas was one of the 
          Sahaabah who issued the most fatwas. We have mentioned above that his 
          fatwas were compiled in twenty volumes. Sa’eed ibn al-Musayyib also 
          issued a lot of fatwas, and they used to call him al-Jaree’ (the 
          Bold), as was mentioned by Ibn Wahb from Muhammad ibn Sulaymaan al-Muraadi 
          from Abu Ishaaq, who said: I used to see a man at that time entering 
          and asking about some matter, and the people would divert him, sending 
          him from one gathering to another, until he was sent to the gathering 
          of Sa’eed ibn al-Musayyib, because they did not like to issue a fatwa. 
          He said, And they used to call Sa’eed ibn al-Musayyib, al-Jaree’ (the 
          Bold). 
 
          Sahnoon said: I memorized some issues concerning which 
          there would be eight opinions from eight of the leading scholars, so 
          how could I hasten to answer before I am certain which one is correct? 
          Why should anyone blame me for not giving an answer? Ibn Wahb said: 
          Ashhal ibn Haatim told us from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Awn from Ibn Seereen 
          who said: Hudhayfah said: The one who gives fatwas to the people is 
          one of three: either he knows what has been abrogated of the Qur’aan, 
          or he is a leader who has no choice (but to issue a fatwa) or he is 
          a fool who is doing something that is not his job. He said, perhaps 
          Ibn Seereen said: I am neither of the first two, and I do not want to 
          be the third.","I’laam al-Muwaqqi’een, 1/28, 29"
21029,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21029,Tribal laws and the call to revive them,"Some of them have published articles calling for the revival of tribal law, saying that this is a heritage which should not be lost and that they should be compiled and studied, that academic studies should be conducted on them comparing them to one another and to other laws. What is the ruling on that?",,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          All Muslims must refer for judgement to the Word of Allaah 
          and the Sunnah of His Messenger Muhammad 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in all matters, and not 
          to tribal customs and traditions, or to man-made laws. Allaah says (interpretation 
          of the meaning): 
 
          “And in whatsoever you differ, the decision thereof 
          is with Allaah (He is the ruling Judge).”[al-Shoora 42:10] 
 
          “Have you not seen those (hypocrites) who claim that 
          they believe in that which has been sent down to you, and that which 
          was sent down before you, and they wish to go for judgement (in their 
          disputes) to the Tâghût (false judges) while they have been ordered 
          to reject them. But Shaitân (Satan) wishes to lead them far astray”[al-Nisaa’ 
          4:10] 
 
          “Do they then seek the judgement of (the days of) 
          Ignorance? And who is better in judgement than Allaah for a people who 
          have firm Faith”
 
          [al-Maa’idah 5:50] 
 
          “O you who believe! Obey Allaah and obey the Messenger 
          (Muhammad), and those of you (Muslims) who are in authority. (And) if 
          you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allaah and His 
          Messenger, if you believe in Allaah and in the Last Day. That is better 
          and more suitable for final determination”[al-Nisaa’ 4:59]
 
          Every Muslim must submit to the ruling of Allaah and 
          His Messenger, and not give precedence to the ruling of anyone other 
          than Allaah and His Messenger – no matter who they may be – over their 
          ruling. Just as worship must be for Allaah alone, so too the hukm 
          (judgement, command) belongs to Him alone, as Allaah says (interpretation 
          of the meaning): 
 
          “The command (or the judgement) is for none but Allaah”
 
          [Yoosuf 12:40]
 
          Referring for judgement to anything other than the Book 
          of Allaah or to anything other than the Sunnah of His Messenger 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), is one of the gravest of 
          evil actions and one of the worst of sins; indeed, a person may become 
          a kaafir by referring for judgement to anything other than the Book 
          of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), if he believes that this 
          is permissible or he believes that the ruling of anyone other than Allaah 
          and His Messenger is better. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
 
          “But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until 
          they make you (O Muhammad) judge in all disputes between them, and find 
          in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) 
          with full submission”
 
          [al-Nisa’ 4:65]
 
          He is not a believer who does not refer for judgement 
          to Allaah and His Messenger both in basic matters of religion and in 
          minor issues, and with regard to rights and duties. Whoever refers for 
          judgement to anyone other than Allaah and His Messenger as referred 
          for judgement to Taaghoot (false judges). 
 
          Hence we conclude that it is not permissible to revive 
          tribal laws, customs and systems to which they refer for judgement instead 
          of to the pure sharee’ah which has been prescribed by the Most Just 
          of the Judges and the Most Merciful of those who show mercy. Rather 
          we must bury it, kill it off and turn away from it, and be content to 
          refer for judgement to the laws of Allaah, in which there is good for 
          all people and protection for their religious and worldly affairs. The 
          tribal shaykhs should not judge between the people according to customs 
          which have no basis in Islam and for which Allaah has sent down no authority. 
          Rather they should refer matters concerning which their tribes dispute 
          to the sharee’ah courts. This will by no means prevent reconciliation 
          between disputing parties by removing hatred and uniting people and 
          pleasing both parties without forcing anyone, in a manner that does 
          not go against the sharee’ah, because Allaah says (interpretation of 
          the meaning): 
 
          “and making peace is better”[al-Nisa’ 4:128] 
 
          “There is no good in most of their secret talks save 
          (in) him who orders Sadaqah (charity in Allaah’s Cause), or Ma‘roof 
          (Islamic Monotheism and all the good 
          and righteous deeds which Allaah has ordained), or conciliation between 
          mankind”[al-Nisa’ 4:114] 
 
          “So fear Allaah and adjust all matters of difference 
          among you”
 
          [al-Anfaal 8:1]
 
          And it was narrated that the Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Reconciliation among 
          Muslims is permissible, apart from a reconciliation which forbids something 
          that is permitted or permits something that is forbidden.” 
 
          What is obligatory is to adhere to the Book of Allaah 
          and the Sunnah of His Messenger 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and to refer to them for 
          judgement, and to beware of anything that goes against them; and we 
          must repent sincerely from anything that has been done in the past which 
          went against the laws of Allaah. 
 
          May Allaah help us all to do that which He loves and 
          which pleases Him; may He grant us all refuge from the misguidance of 
          fitan (tribulation) and the misguidance of the Shaytaan, for He is All-Hearing, 
          Ever Near. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad and his family and 
          companions, and grant them peace.","Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah li Samaahat al-Shaykh al-‘Allaamah ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him), vol. 8, p. 272"

“Made lawful to you this day are At-Tayyibaat [all kinds of Halal (lawful) foods, which Allah has made lawful (meat of slaughtered eatable animals, milk products, fats, vegetables and fruits)]. The food (slaughtered cattle, eatable animals) of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) is lawful to you and yours is lawful to them. (Lawful to you in marriage) are chaste women from the believers and chaste women from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before your time when you have given their due Mahr (bridal-money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage)…” [Al-Maa’idah 5:5]
This refers to chaste women from among the People of the Book, not immoral women. It is not permissible for a Muslim woman to marry a mushrik who is not a Muslim, no matter what his religion is. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And give not (your daughters) in marriage to Al-Mushrikoon till they believe (in Allah Alone) and verily, a believing slave is better than a (free) Mushrik (idolater), even though he pleases you. Those (Al-Mushrikoon) invite you to the Fire…” [Al-Baqarah 2:221]

Shaykh ‘Abd al-Kareem al-Khudayr
It is known that the man is the stronger party and the one who dominates the lives of the family, his wife and children. So it is not wise for a Muslim woman to marry a kaafir man who will dominate her life and the life of her children, the consequences of which will be very serious, as there is the possibility that he may divert her from her religion and raise the children in his own religion.

Do I count the 2 of the 3 days of Tashriq that I started fasting or must I start counting my ten days (due to menses and illness) after Tashriq?,"The majority of scholars said that it is not permissible to fast on the Days of Tashriq whether it is an optional fast, making up a missed fast or fasting in fulfillment of a vow. So, the fasts that you observed on the Days of Tashriq to make up for missed Ramadan fasts, are not valid, and you must repeat them.","Is it permissible to fast the Days of Tashriq?


Can you make up missed fasts during Tashriq days?","Praise be to Allah.Is it permissible to fast the Days of Tashriq?
The days of Tashriq are the three days following `Eid Al-Adha , namely the 11th, 12th and 13th of Dhul-Hijjah. It is prohibited to fast on these days . 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The days of Tashriq are the days of eating and drinking.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1141, from the Hadith of Nubayshah Al-Hadhali (may Allah be pleased with him)) 
And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The day of `Arafah, the day of Sacrifice (An-Nahr) and the days of Tashriq are our `Eid, us Muslims, and they are days of eating and drinking. (Narrated by An-Nasa’i , 3004; At-Tirmidhi, 773; Abu Dawud, 2419 – from the Hadith of `Uqbah ibn `Amir (may Allah be pleased with him). THe Hadith was classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud.) 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not grant a concession allowing anyone to fast on these three days except for the pilgrims performing Tamattu` or Qiran types of Hajj, who did not have sacrificial animal with them. 
Al-Bukhari (1998) narrated that `Aishah and Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with them) said: “No one was allowed to fast on the days of Tashriq except the (pilgrim) who did not have a sacrificial animal.” 
Can you make up missed fasts during Tashriq days?
The majority of scholars said that it is not permissible to fast on the Days of Tashriq, regardless of whether that is an optional fast, making up a missed fast or fasting in fulfillment of a vow. They said that a fast was invalid if it was observed during this time. 
The most correct view is that of the majority, and there are no exceptions except in the case of the pilgrim who does not have a sacrificial animal. 
Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Similar fasts should not be observed on the day of `Eid Al-Adha or the Days of Tashriq, because the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade that. But there is evidence that it is permissible to fast on the days of Tashriq for the pilgrim performing Tamattu` or Qiran Hajj in lieu of offering the sacrifice, especially those who are unable to offer the sacrifice. But fasting them on a voluntary basis or for any other reason is not permissible, as in the case of `Eid.” (Fatawa Ramadan, compiled by Ashraf `Abd Al-Maqsud, p. 716) 
Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“It is permissible for the pilgrim performing Tamattu` or Qiran, if he cannot find a sacrificial animal, to fast these three days so that he can fast them during the Hajj season. But apart from that it is not permissible to fast these days; even if a person is fasting two consecutive months, he must not fast on the day of `Id and the three days that follow it, then he should resume his fasting.” (Fatawa Ramadan, p. 727) 
Based on this, the fasts that you observed on the Days of Tashriq to make up for missed Ramadan fasts, are not valid, and you must repeat them. 
When making up missed Ramadan fasts, the days need not be consecutive , so you can make up the missed fasts on consecutive days or on separate days. 
And Allah knows best.",Islam Q&A
21052,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21052,Whispers from the Shaytaan,"A waswasa (satanic whisper) is disturbing that maybe the rules of shirk (polytheism) which apply in this world do not apply in the universe. Somewhere else in the universe there might be a place where the dead can hear and help, where going to the graves is a form of worship etc. Please help me to fight this waswasa.",,,"Praise be to Allah.One of the means that the Shaytan uses to misguide people is by casting doubts and whispers (waswas) into their hearts. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has warned us against some of these things. It says in the hadeeth: “The Shaytan comes to any one of you and says, ‘Who created such and such? Who created such and such?’ until he says, ‘Who created your Lord?’ If that happens to you, seek refuge with Allah and give up these thoughts.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, no. 3277 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught us two important things: 
1 – To turn to Allah and seek His protection, and to beseech Him, for He is the most Generous: 
And if an evil suggestion comes to you from Satan, then seek refuge in Allah. (al-A’raf 7:200 – interpretation of the meaning)
2 – To put a stop to this matter and turn away from it, and to keep ourselves busy with other, useful things. 
The Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came to him complaining about the doubts and waswas that they were suffering. In Saheeh Muslim it is narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Some of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came to him and said, ‘We find in our hearts things that none of us dares utter.’ He said, ‘Do you really find that?’ They said, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘That is clear faith.’” (2/153). 
What is meant by his saying ‘That is clear faith’ is that their hatred of that waswasah and their rejecting it was a clear sign of faith. 
The Shaytan only whispers to people of faith; as for the kafir (non-Muslim), he comes to him, however, he wants and does not limit himself to waswas, rather he toys with him however he wishes. 
The belief concerning which there can be no doubt is that the entire universe, from its heights to its depths, is in a state of submission to Allah and no one in the universe possesses any power. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
{Say, [O Muhammad], ""Invoke those you claim [as deities] besides Allah ."" They do not possess an atom's weight [of ability] in the heavens or on the earth, and they do not have therein any partnership [with Him], nor is there for Him from among them any assistant.
And intercession does not benefit with Him except for one whom He permits.} (Saba 34:22-23)
This crafty enemy is keen to misguide people and to make them doubt. The more you seek the help of Allah, learn about your enemy and be prepared to face him, the more you will be victorious over him. If you know your true enemy, the following are the weapons at your disposal. 
Firstly: 
Adherence to the Quran and Sunnah in word and deed, and keeping away from the paths of misguidance, for on every path there is a devil calling people to it. So you should follow the beliefs, words, acts of worship and laws that have come from Allah and abstain from that which He has forbidden. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
O you who have believed, enter into al-silm completely [and perfectly] (al-Baqarah 2:208)
Al-silm refers to Islam. Muqatil interpreted it as doing all kinds of good and righteous deeds. 
Whoever gives up any part of Islam has followed in some of the footsteps of the Shaytan. 
Adhering to the Quran and Sunnah in word and deed expels the Shaytan and annoys him greatly. Muslim narrated from Abu Hurayrah: “When the son of Adam recites a verse of sajdah (prostration) and prostrates, the Shaytan withdraws weeping, saying, ‘Woe to me, the son of Adam was commanded to prostrate, and he prostrated, so Paradise will be his; I was commanded to prostrate and I disobeyed, so Hell will be mine.’” Narrated by Muslim, no. 133. 
Secondly: 
Seeking refuge with Allah from all kinds of evil and turning to Him. Islam teaches us to seek refuge with Allah in certain situations, such as the following: 
When entering the washroom: “Allahumma inni a’oodhu bika min al-khubthi wa’l-khabaith (O Allah, I seek refuge with You from the male and female devils).” 
When one is angry: “A’oodhu Billahi min al-Shaytan ir-rajeem (I seek refuge with Allah from the accursed Shaytan).” 
When having intercourse: “Bismillah Allahumma jannibna al-shaytan wa jannib al-shaytana ma razaqtana (In the name of Allah, O Allah, keep the Shaytan away from us and keep the Shaytan away from that which You may bless us with).” 
When stopping in a place: “A’oodhu bi kalimat-Allaah il-tammati min sharri ma khalaqa (I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allah from the evil of that which He has created).” 
When hearing the braying of a donkey: “A’oodhu Billahi min al-Shaytan ir-rajeem (I seek refuge with Allah from the accursed Shaytan).” 
When starting to read Quran: “A’oodhu Billah il-samee’ il-‘aleem min al-Shaytan ir-rajeem (I seek refuge with Allah, the All-Hearing, All-Knowing, from the accursed Shaytan).” 
After starting to pray: “A’oodhu Billah il-samee’ il-‘aleem min al-Shaytan ir-rajeem wa min hamzihi wa nafakhihi wa nafthihi (I seek refuge with Allah, the All-Hearing, All-Knowing, from the accursed Shaytan, from his madness, his arrogance and his poetry).” 
The best words with which we may seek refuge with Allah are al-Mua’wwidhatayn, i.e., Soorat al-Falaq and Soorat al-Nas. It was narrated from ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Amir (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do you not see the verses that were revealed to me tonight, the like of which have never been seen? Qul ‘aoodhu bi Rabb il-falaq and Qul ‘aoodhi bi rabb il-nas.” Narrated by Muslim, 814. 
Thirdly: 
Keeping busy with dhikr (the remembrance of Allah), for this is the greatest thing that may protect a person. In the hadeeth (prophetic tradition) it says that Allah commanded Yahya (peace be upon him) to enjoin five things upon the Children of Israel, one of which was: “I command you to remember Allah, for this is like a man who is being pursued by the enemy, then he comes to a strong fortress and saves himself from them. Similarly a man cannot save himself from his enemy except by means of dhikr.” Narrated by al-Hafiz Abu Moosa al-Madani in al-Targheeb fi’l-Khisal al-Hameedah wa’l-Tarheeb min al-Khilal al-Murdiyyah. Ibn al-Qayyim said: Shaykh al-Islam used to regard this hadeeth highly, and I heard that he used to say: “The evidence for its being sound is quite clear.” al-Wabil al-Sayyib, 60. 
Fourthly: 
Adhering to the main body of the Muslims (the jama’ah) by living in a Muslim land and choosing righteous friends who will help him to do good. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever among you wants to attain the best part of Paradise, let him adhere to the main body of the Muslims, for the Shaytan is with the one who is alone, but he is farther away from two.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2254. Al-Qari said: its isnad (chain of narrators) is saheeh (authentic). Al-Mubarakfoori said: The entire hadeeth is either saheeh or hasan (sound). Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi, 6/320. 
Fifthly: 
Opposing the Shaytan, for he may come in the form of someone offering sincere advice, so we must go against him. For if he were really good he would be good to himself first, but he has caused himself to be doomed to Hell. So if he comes to you whilst you are praying, and says, “You are showing off (so cut your prayer short),” then make your prayer lengthy. If he says, “You have broken your wudu,” say, “You are lying”. If he says to you that the dead can hear you and benefit you or harm you, tell him, “You are lying.” When you eat, be different from him and eat and drink with your right hand, and take food with your right hand. This even applies to taking a siesta, as it says in the hadeeth: “Take a siesta for the devils do not take a siesta.” Narrated by Abu Na’eem with a saheeh isnad. Saheeh al-Jami’, 4/147. 
Even with regard to a piece of food that falls to the ground, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Pick it up and do not leave it for the Shaytan…” Narrated by Muslim, 12, al-Adab. 
Sixthly: 
Repenting and seeking Allah’s forgiveness. According to the hadeeth, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The Shaytan said to the Lord of Glory: ‘By Your Glory O Lord, I will keep trying to misguide Your slaves so long as their souls are in their bodies.’ The Lord said, ‘By My Glory and Majesty, I will continue to forgive them so long as they ask My forgiveness.’” Narrated by Ahmad in al-Musnad and classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Jami’, 2/32 
So man should always be in a state of repentance and turning to Allah. They have an example in their father Adam (peace be upon him): 
""Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves, and if You do not forgive us and have mercy upon us, we will surely be among the losers."" (al-A’raf 7:23 – interpretation of the meaning) 
These are some of the means that will help you to ward off this waswas. We ask Allah, the Almighty, by His most beautiful names and sublime attributes to grant us refuge from the madness of the devils and from their traps and whispers. And praise be to the Lord of the Worlds.",Islam Q&A

How to give up lesbianism


Effects of sins on the one who commits them","Praise be to Allah.What is the punishment for lesbianism?
Lesbianism means a woman having sexual relations with another woman. This is undoubtedly haram, and some scholars regard it as a major sin. (See Az-Zawajir ‘an Iqtiraf Al-Kaba’ir, no. 362) 
The imams are agreed that there is no hadd punishment for lesbianism because it is not zina (unlawful sexual intercourse), rather it is to be punished with a ta'zir punishment in which the judge punishes the one who does that with a punishment which will deter her and others from doing this haram action. 
It says in Al-Mawsu`ah al-Fiqhiyyah (24/252): 
“The jurists agreed that there is no hadd punishment for lesbianism , because it is not zina. Rather a ta'zir punishment must be imposed, because it is a sin.” 
Ibn Qudamah said (9/59): 
“If two women engage in lesbian sexual relations, then they are guilty of zina and are cursed, because it was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If a woman has sexual relations with another woman, then they are both guilty of zina.” There is no hadd punishment for them because they did not have intercourse, rather it is likened to intimate relations that are less than intercourse, and they are to be subjected to a ta`zir punishment.” 
It says in Tuhfat Al-Muhtaj, 9/105: 
“There is no hadd punishment for a woman who has sexual relations with another woman, rather they should be punished with a ta`zir punishment.” 
Some people think that the punishment for lesbianism is the same as the punishment for zina, because of the Hadith quoted by Ibn Qudamah as referred to above. 
This Hadith was narrated by Al-Bayhaqi from Abu Musa (may Allah be pleased with him), who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If a man has sexual relations with another man, they are both guilty of zina, and if a woman has sexual relations with another woman they are both guilty of zina.” 
This hadith is weak; it was classed as weak by Al-Albani in Da`if al-Jami`, 282. 
Al-Shawkani said in Nayl Al-Awtar (7/287): 
“Its isnad includes Muhammad ibn ‘Abd Ar-Rahman whom Abu Hatim described as a liar. Al-Bayhaqi said: I do not know him. So the Hadith is munkar (rejected) with this isnad.”
Even if the Hadith were authentic, it is to be understood as meaning that they are guilty of zina in the sense that they are sinning, not with regard to hadd punishment. This was the view of As-Sarkhasi in Al-Mabsut, 9/78. 
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Every son of Adam has his share of zina. For the eyes may commit zina and their zina is looking; the hands may commit zina and their zina is touching; the feet may commit zina and their zina is walking; the mouth may commit zina and its zina is kissing. The heart desires and wishes and the private parts confirm that or deny it.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, Muslim, and Ahmad. This version narrated by Ahmad, 8321) 
How to give up lesbianism
The woman who is faced with lesbianism has to hasten to repent to Allah, and strive to treat this disease. Some of the ways of treating lesbianism are: 

Fearing Allah and worshipping Him and loving Him sincerely, and being serious about that. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): {Thus it was, that We might turn away from him evil and illegal sexual intercourse . Surely, he was one of Our chosen, (guided) slaves.} [Yusuf 12:24] 
Lowering the gaze , for this is one of the most effective means of purifying the soul. So if a person sees something that attracts him, he should not look again. 
Remembering the dead whose deeds have come to an end, so they are not able to wipe out their bad deeds or do more good deeds.
Keeping oneself busy with beneficial things.
Marriage and hastening to get married if possible.

Effects of sins on the one who commits them
Undoubtedly falling into sin and transgressing the sacred limits of Allah are among the causes of the punishments that befall people en masse or individually. Punishment comes by the will of Allah because of sin and affects a person in his religious commitment or in his spiritual or physical well-being. These punishments may come in this world, in the grave and in the Hereafter. 
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “There are more than fifty types of effects of sin which are dealt with in detail in the book Ad-Da’ Wa’d-Dawa’.”
When discussing the means of being patient in avoiding sin, in his book Tariq Al-Hijratayn, he mentioned that some of the effects of sin are: blackness of face and darkness in the heart; stress, worry, grief, anxiety and hardheartedness; being forsaken by Allah, so He does not help or support one; sickness in the heart which, if chronic, leads to death, for sins inevitably deaden the heart. Another effect is humiliation after being honoured; feeling alienated after feeling at ease; feeling far away from Allah after having found peace of mind in Him; poverty after richness, for he was rich and had capital, which is faith, then when he lost his capital he became poor and deprived, and he can only get that wealth back by repenting sincerely and striving hard; loss of provision, for a person is deprived of provision as a result of sins that he commits.
A seal and stain on the heart, for when a person commits sin a black spot appears on his heart, but if he repents it disappears.
Allah, His angels and His slaves turn away from him, for when a person turns away from obedience to Allah and becomes busy with sin, Allah and His angels turn away from him. 
In conclusion, the effects of sin are many more than a person can grasp, and the effects of obedience are many more than a person can comprehend. The best of this world and the Hereafter are to be found in obeying Allah and the worst of this world and the Hereafter are all to be found in disobeying Allah.

21062,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21062,It is not permissible for a woman to be appointed as a judge,Is it permissible for a woman to be appointed as a judge (qaadi) in Islamic sharee’ah?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Ibn Jibreen was asked whether it is 
    permissible for a woman to be a qaadi. He replied: 
It is not permissible for a woman to be 
    appointed to public positions which generally require speaking with men, mixing with them and going out frequently, asking questions of non-mahram 
    men, and answering their questions. Such behaviour indicates that a woman is careless and audacious, which will lead to her giving up her modesty. 
    This position also requires her  to raise her voice. That is contrary to her femininity and modesty. Similarly a woman cannot become an imam or 
    khateeb or lawyer who has to frequent the courts and offices which are filled with men. 
This is also a kind of imitating men, and the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed women who imitate men. 
With regard to jobs which a woman may need, 
    there is nothing wrong with a woman being appointed to them, such as teaching female students, being a doctor or nurse treating female patients. A 
    woman may also work in offices that are visited only by women, so that women will not be forced to mix with men, which may be a cause of spreading 
    wanton display (tabarruj) and unveiling, and other things that lead to evil and immorality. And Allaah knows best.

21065,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21065,Are the contemporary Islamic groups among the seventy-three sects?,"There are some who say that the groups which we are commanded to shun in the hadeeth of Hudhayfah are the Islamic groups such as the Salafis, the Ikhwaan (Muslim Brotherhood) and the Tableeghis. What do you say concerning that?",,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          When Hudhayfah asked, “O Messenger of Allaah, we were 
          in a state of ignorance and evil, then Allaah brought us this good. 
          Will there be any evil after this good?” the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Yes.” Hudahyfah asked, 
          “Will there be any good after that evil?” He said, “Yes, but it would 
          be tainted with dakhan (i.e. a little evil).” I asked, “What will its 
          dakhan be?” He said, “There will be some people who will guide (people) 
          according to something other than my guidance and will lead them according 
          to something other than my Sunnah. You will see their actions and disapprove 
          of them.” Hudhayfah said, “Will there be any evil after that good?” 
          He said, “Yes, there will be some people who will invite others to the 
          doors of Hell, and whoever accepts their invitation to it will be thrown 
          in it (by them).” Hudhayfah said, “O Messenger of Allaah, describe those 
          people to us.” He said, “They will be from among us and speak our language 
          (i.e., from among the Arabs).” Hudhayfah asked, “What do you command 
          us to do at that point?” He said, “Adhere to the jamaa’ah (group) of 
          the Muslims and their leader.” Hudhayfah asked, “What if there is no 
          jamaa’ah and no leader?” He said, “Keep away from all those different 
          sects, even if you have to bite (i.e. eat) the root of a tree, till 
          you die while you are still in that state.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari 
          and Muslim). 
 
          This important hadeeth explains to us that the Muslim 
          is obliged to adhere to the jamaa’ah of the Muslims and to co-operate 
          with them wherever they may be, whether it is a jamaa’ah that is found 
          in the Arabian Peninsula, or in Egypt, or in Syria, or in Iraq, or in 
          America, or in Europe, or in any place. 
 
          When the Muslim finds a group that is calling people 
          to the truth, he should help them and be one of them, he should aid 
          them and encourage them, help them to remain steadfast in adhering to 
          the truth. If he cannot find a jamaa’ah at all, then he should adhere 
          to the truth and he will be the jamaa’ah even if he is only one, as 
          Ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) said to ‘Amr ibn Maymoon: 
          “The jamaa’ah is that which is in accordance with the truth, even if 
          you are on your own.” 
 
          The Muslim has to seek the truth. If he finds an Islamic 
          center which promotes the truth, or a group in any place which promotes 
          the truth – i.e., which calls people to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah 
          of His Messenger, and to sound belief – in Europe or Africa or in any 
          place – then he should join them and seek the truth, doing so with patience, 
          and being with the people of truth. 
 
          This is what is obligatory upon the Muslim. But if he 
          cannot find anyone who calls people to the truth, whether a state or 
          a group, then he must adhere to the truth on his own and be steadfast 
          in doing so. In that case he will be the jamaa’ah, as Ibn Mas’ood (may 
          Allaah be pleased with him) said to ‘Amr ibn Maymoon. 
 In 
          these times – praise be to Allaah – there are many groups which are 
          calling people to the truth, as in the Arabian Peninsula (the Saudi 
          government), the Yemen, the Gulf, Egypt, Syria, Africa, Europe, America, 
          India, Pakistan and other parts of the world. There are many groups 
          and Islamic centers and Islamic societies which are calling people to 
          the truth and proclaiming the message, and warning against that which 
          is opposed to it. So the Muslim who is seeking the truth in any place 
          has to look for these groups, and when he finds a group or a center 
          or a society which is calling people to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah 
          of His Messenger 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), he should follow it and 
          adhere to it, such as the Ansaar al-Sunnah in Egypt and Sudan, Jama’iyyat 
          Ahl al-Hadeeth in Pakistan and India, and other groups which are calling 
          people to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), devoting their worship 
          sincerely to Allaah alone, and not calling upon anyone else such as 
          the occupants of graves or others.","Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah li Samaahat al-Shaykh al-‘Allaamah ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him), vol. 8, p. 179"

4- Wipe the face with both hands. 
5- Recite the same dua's that are recited after wudu.","How to perform tayammum 


What should be wiped first in tayammum?","Praise be to Allah.How to perform tayammum 
Al-Bukhari and Muslim narrated the hadeeth of ‘Ammar ibn Yasir describing tayammum . Al-Bukhari narrated it in a number of places in his Sahih. One of these reports (no. 347; 1/455 of Fath al-Bari) says: “ ‘It would have been sufficient for you to do this’ – then he struck the palms of his hands on the ground, then dusted them off, then wiped the back of each hand with the other, then he wiped his face with his hands.” 
Abu Dawud (317; 1/515 of ‘Awn al-Ma’bud) narrated it with the same isnad as al-Bukhari, apart from the Shaykh of al-Bukhari (Muhammad ibn Salam), instead of whom he mentioned Muhammad ibn Sulayman al-Anbari, of whom al-Hafiz said in al-Taqrib (2/167): he is saduq (truthful). This version of the report says: “He struck his hands on the ground and dusted them off, then he struck his right hand with his left hand, and his left hand with his right hand, then he wiped his face.” 
Al-Hafiz mentioned in al-Fath (1/457) that al-Ism’ili narrated it with the wording: “It would have been sufficient for you to strike your hands on the ground, then dust them off, then wipe your right hand over your left and your left hand over your right, then wipe your face.” 
What should be wiped first in tayammum?
Al-Shanqiti said in Adwa’ al-Bayan (2/43): 
“This hadith of al-Bukhari states that the hands should be wiped before the face.” 
Shaykh al-Islam said in al-Fatawa (21/423): 
“The report of al-Bukhari clearly shows that the back of the hand should be wiped before the face. The fact that in another report he said ‘the back of the hand’ indicates that he wiped the back of each with the palm of the other.” He also said (21/425:  “But the report which was narrated only by al-Bukhari shows that he wiped the backs of the hands before the face.” (See al-Fatawa, 21/422-427) 
Based on this, the way in which tayammum is done is to say Bismillah with the intention of doing tayammum , then strike the ground once with the palms of the hands, then wipe the back of the right hand with the palm of the left, and the back of the left hand with the palm of the right, then wipe the face with both hands. Then the same du'as that are recited after wudu’ should be recited after tayammum.
