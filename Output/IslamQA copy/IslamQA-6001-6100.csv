The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded women to do ghusl if they notice water (fluid), as was reported by Malik in al-Muwatta (1/51), and by al-Bukhari (282) and al-Nasai (1/114) from Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: Umm Sulaim, the wife of Abu Talhah, came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, “O Messenger of Allah, Allah is not too shy to tell the truth. Does a woman have to do ghusl if she has an (erotic) dream?” He said, “Yes, if she sees water (fluid).” In this hadith, he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded women to do ghusl if they see water, i.e., maniy.
 Al-Baghawi said in Sharh al-Sunnah (2/9): 
“Ghusl for janabah (impurity following sexual activity) is wajib (obligatory) if either of the following applies: either the tip of the penis penetrates the vagina, or the gushing liquid is emitted by the man or the woman… The scholars said that ghusl does not become obligatory unless one is sure that what one feels of wetness comes from the gushing liquid.”
 Ibn Qudamah said in al-Mughni (1/200): 
“The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) connected doing ghusl to seeing (the fluid) when he said: “If you see the water and if the water gushes out , then do ghusl.” The ruling does not apply otherwise.”
 Ibn Hajar said in al-Fath (1/389): 
“This indicates that ghusl is obligatory for women, if they emit fluid at the point of climax.”
Ibn Rajab said in al-Fath (1/338): 
“This hadith indicates that if a woman sees an (erotic) dream and notices the fluid when she wakes up, she has to do ghusl. This was the view of the majority of scholars and no dissenting view is known except for that of al-Nakha’i, who is the odd one out.”
This hadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) makes the matter quite clear, which is that if any fluid is emitted by the woman – whether it is a little or a lot – then she has to do ghusl.
On the basis of the above, if a woman feels that some fluid has come out of her vagina, even if it is only a little, then she has to do ghusl, because of the report to that effect. It is not sufficient for her to do wudu in this case unless the fluid which was emitted was not the kind of fluid for which ghusl is required, such as madhiy (lubricating secretion) etc., in which case wudu is sufficient.

“And everything they have done is noted in (their) Records (of
    deeds).” (al-Qamar 54:52)
And in the Saheeh Hadeeth:
“The first thing which Allaah created was the Pen. He said to it:
    ‘Write!’ It said, ‘O Lord, what should I write?’ He said: ‘Write
    what is to happen until the Day of Resurrection.’”
According to another hadeeth:
“Allaah decreed everything for His creation fifty thousand years
    before He created the heavens and the earth.”
These decrees are hidden from us and we do not know them. It is not
    permissible for us to rely on this and neglect to strive and take all necessary means.
    There is no contradiction between the two ideas. The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him) said:
“O slaves of Allaah, seek treatment but do not seek treatment in
    haraam things, for Allaah has not sent down any disease without also sending down the

    easy for him.”

      quick reply.",,,"Praise be to Allah.We thank you very much for sending this question to us, and we say to you
    that your deep interest in Islam is what will make you embrace this religion soon, in sha
    Allaah (if Allaah wills). Your current attitude is an important step towards entering this
    religion, which Allaah wants and besides which He accepts no other religion. Your
    conviction that this is the true religion of Allaah means that you must now take the
    ultimate step and pronounce the Shahaadatayn (the twin declarations of faith). When this
    reply reaches you, go and take a bath (ghusl) and say:
“Ash-hadu an laa ilaaha ill-Allaah wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadan
    Rasool-Allaah (I bear witness that there is no god but Allaah, and I bear witness that
    Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah).” Then start to practice the rituals of this
    great religion, above all the five daily prayers at the appointed times, as Allaah
    enjoined them.
Know that one of the rules of Islam is that you should love Allaah and His
    Messenger, and that love for Allaah should take priority over love for anyone else. Allaah
    says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Say: If your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your wives, your
    kindred, the wealth that you have gained, the commerce in which you fear a decline, and
    the dwellings in which you delight are dearer to you than Allaah and His Messenger, and
    striving hard and fighting in His Cause, then wait until Allaah brings about His Decision
    (torment). And Allaah guides not the people who are Al-Fasiqoon (the rebellious,
    disobedient to Allaah)” [al-Tawbah 9:24]
The Prophet of Islam, Muhammad 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There are three things, whoever attains them
    will find the sweetness of faith: when Allaah and His Messenger are more beloved to him
    than everything else; when he loves another person he loves him only for the sake of
    Allaah; and when he hates to return to Kufr as he would hate to be thrown into the
    fire.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh, no. 15).
This means that love for Allaah must come before love for
    one’s parents and any other created being. If there is a conflict between pleasing
    Allaah and pleasing your parents, then pleasing Allaah must take precedence. In your
    situation, as you have described it, we advise you to do the following with regard to your
    parents:
Address them in the best of terms and treat them in the best manner

If they insist that you follow kufr, then conceal your Islam if you fear
        that you are not able to confront them openly, and pray where they cannot see you

Do not think at all that there is any burden or sin on you if they get
        angry with you for becoming a Muslim. Remember that when a person pleases Allaah even
        though it makes people angry, Allaah will be pleased with him and will make the people
        pleased with him.

Keep on praying for them to be guided and call them to Islam with wisdom
        and beautiful preaching. Maybe Allaah will guide them through you.

    those who follow true guidance.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

To get to know Allah and be able to know that He is with us in our daily life, it is a great comfort. However, I was so stunned by the air plane crash of JFK Jr., I could not stop crying. I don't understand why Allah sometimes acts in such a mysteroius way. I feel that we as human beings really don't have control over our lives. When I am in a difficult situation, I often pray to Allah to help me go through the tough time, sometimes I feel my prayers are being answered, that Allah is so close to me; yet other times I feel He is so distanced from us, prayers to Allah are the only way for me to get comfort from the Almighty, but I still don't understand why tragedy happens so often.",,,"Praise be to Allah.for your coming to Islam. 
    Allah has blessed you by making you Muslim. And praise be to Allah for the 
    fact that you feel Allah is with you, for this is what brings peace to the 
    heart and makes deeds righteous. 
    
    Please understand that Allah sends trials 
    upon people so as to distinguish between them, so that it will be known who 
    will bear them with patience and the hope of reward from Allah, and who will 
    be filled with despair and will resent the decree of Allah. So those who are 
    patient will be rewarded with Paradise and those who despair will be 
    punished with torment, grief and pain in this world, before the Hereafter. 
    

    The plane crash which you mentioned is of 
    this nature. The people on board were either committed Muslims, so this 
    disaster is an expiation for their sins and will raise their status, as it 
    is a kind of martyrdom (shahadah) for which they will be rewarded, and their 
    families will be rewarded if they bear their loss with patience; or they 
    were kuffar (disbelievers) and evildoers who did not obey their Lord, so the 
    accident was a punishment from Allah and vengeance from Him.  

    A Muslim must not feel sad for the death of non-Muslims 
    because every human being is destined to die. But dying before we Muslims 
    were able to guide them to Islam is our source of grief and sadness because 
    whoever is not Muslim is doomed in Hell.

    There is nothing mysterious about this as 
    you claim. It is the decree of Allah which happens at every instant; we must 
    bear it with patience and not let grief overwhelm us. The crash of this 
    airplane is a sign from Allah to mankind, to remind them of the greatness of 
    the power of Allah. 

     Allah says concerning ships (interpretation 
    of the meaning): 

    “And among His Signs are the ships in the 
    sea like mountains. 

    If He wills, He causes the wind to cease, 
    then they would become motionless on the back (of the sea). Verily, in this 
    are signs for everyone patient and grateful. 

    Or He may destroy them (by shipwreck) 
    because of that which their (people) have earned. And He pardons much.
    

    And those who dispute 
    (polytheists, with Our Messenger Muhammad) as regards Our Ayat (proofs, 
    signs, verses of Islamic Monotheism) may know that there is no place of 
    refuge for them (from Allah’s punishment) 

    So whatever you have been given is but (a 
    passing) enjoyment for this worldly life, but that which is with Allah 
    (Paradise) is better and more lasting for those who believe (in the Oneness 
    of Allah, Islamic Monotheism) and put their trust in their Lord (concerning 
    all of their affairs).” 

    [al-Shoora 42:32-36]

    Plane crashes and other disasters serve to 
    remind people that no matter how much progress they make in earthly terms 
    and how much strength they gain, Allah is stronger and more powerful than 
    they are. What they do and the developments they have made will not save 
    them from the punishment and decree of Allah if it comes to them. Let people 
    go back and look at themselves, and realize how incapable and weak they 
    really are, and how strong, mighty and powerful Allah is.

    Please realize that Allah is close and that 
    He responds to the call of the one who is in need. Allah does not distance 
    Himself from man unless man distances himself from Allah and becomes 
    arrogant.

     Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):

    “And when My slaves ask you (O Muhammad) 
    concerning Me, then (answer them), I am indeed near (to them by My 
    Knowledge). I respond to the invocations of the supplicant when he calls on 
    Me (without any mediator or intercessor). So let them obey Me and believe in 
    Me, so that they may be led aright.”

     [al-Baqarah 2:186] 

     So no one should feel that Allah is far 
    away from him, unless he has done something to affect the relationship 
    between him and Allah. If he puts matters right between him and Allah, then 
    he will not feel that grief and distance.

    The feelings of grief and loneliness that 
    have overwhelmed you are from the accursed Shaytan who wants to cause grief 
    to those who believe; he does not want to see them active in doing actions 
    of obedience to Allah that will bring joy to their hearts.

    Al-Imam Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on 
    him) said:

    Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):

     “And if an evil whisper from Shaytan 
    (Satan) tries to turn you away (O Muhammad) (from doing good), then seek 
    refuge in Allah. Verily, He is the All‑Hearer, the All‑Knower.”

     [Fussilat 41:36] 

    “Show forgiveness, enjoin what is good, and 
    turn away from the foolish (i.e. don’t punish them). And if an evil whisper 
    comes to you from Shaytan (Satan), then seek refuge with Allah. Verily, He 
    is All-Hearer, All-Knower.”

     [al-A’raf 7:199-200] 

    “Repel evil with that which is better. We 
    are Best‑Acquainted with the things they utter. 

    And say: ‘My Lord! I seek refuge with You 
    from the whisperings (suggestions) of the Shayateen (devils). 

    And I seek refuge with You, My Lord! Lest 
    they should come near me.’” 

    [al-Muminoon 23:96-98] 

     “Repel (the evil) with one which is better 
    (i.e. Allah orders the faithful believers to be patient at the time of 
    anger, and to excuse those who treat them badly) then verily he, between 
    whom and you there was enmity, (will become) as though he was a close 
    friend. 

    But none is granted it (the above quality) 
    except those who are patient — and none is granted it except the owner of 
    the great portion (of happiness in the Hereafter, i.e., Paradise and of a 
    high moral character) in this world. 

    And if an evil whisper from Shaytan (Satan) 
    tries to turn you away (O Muhammad) (from doing good), then seek refuge in 
    Allah. Verily, He is the All‑Hearer, the All‑Knower.” 

    [Fussilat 41:34-36] 

    There is no fourth ayah (verse) with a 
    meaning like that of these three, 
    which is that Allah commands us to be kind to human enemies and treat them 
    kindly so that their inherent good nature will prevail and they will become 
    our friends. But He commands us to seek refuge with Him from satanic 
    enemies; there is no point in being kind to them or treating them nicely, 
    for they want only to destroy the sons of Adam because of the intensity of 
    the enmity between them and their father Adam beforehand. Allah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning):  

    “O Children of Adam! Let not Shaytan (Satan) 
    deceive you, as he got your parents [Adam and Hawwa (Eve)] out of Paradise.”

     [al-A’raf 7:27]  

    “Surely, Shaytan (Satan) is an enemy to you, 
    so take (treat) him as an enemy. He only invites his Hizb (followers) that 
    they may become the dwellers of the blazing Fire.”

     [Fatir 35:6] 

     “Will you then take him (Iblees) and his 
    offspring as protectors and helpers rather than Me while they are enemies to 
    you? What an evil is the exchange for the Zalimoon (polytheists, and 
    wrongdoers, etc).” 

    [al-Kahf 18:50] 

    Iblees swore to our father Adam that he was 
    one of the sincere, but he lied, so how about his dealings with us? 
    Especially since he said: 

    “By Your Might, then I will surely mislead 
    them all, except Your chosen slaves amongst them (i.e. faithful, obedient, 
    true believers of Islamic Monotheism).”

     [Sad 38:82-83 – interpretation of the 
    meaning] 

     And Allah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “So when you want to recite the Quran, seek 
    refuge with Allah from Shaytan (Satan), the outcast (the cursed one).  Verily, 
    he has no power over those who believe and put their trust only in their 
    Lord (Allah). His power is only over those who obey and follow him (Satan), 
    and those who join partners with Him (Allah, i.e. those who are Mushrikoon, 
    i.e., polytheists.”

     [al-Nahl 16:98-100] 

    (Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 1/14) 

    So turn to Allah, remember Him and strive to 
    worship Him, so that your soul will become pure and love for Him will become 
    firmly entrenched in your heart, and you will be relieved of your worry and 
    grief. Remember the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace 
    and blessings of Allah be upon him): 

     The Messenger of Allah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no-one who is afflicted by 
    distress and grief, and says: ‘Allaahumma inni ‘abduka ibn ‘abdika ibn 
    amatika nasiyati bi yadika, madin fiyya hukmuka, ‘adlun fiyya qadauka. 
    As’aluka bi kulli ismin huwa laka sammayta bihi nafsaka aw anzaltahu fi 
    kitabika aw ‘allamtahu ahadan min khalqika aw istatharta bihi fi ‘ilm 
    il-ghayb ‘indaka an taj’al al-Qurana rabee’a qalbi wa noor sadri wa jala 
    huzni wa dhihab hammi (O Allah, I am Your slave, son of Your slave, son 
    of Your maidservant; my forelock is in Your hand, Your command over me is 
    forever executed and Your decree over me is just. I ask You by every name 
    belonging to You which You have named Yourself with, or revealed in Your 
    Book, or You taught to any of Your creation, or You have preserved in the 
    knowledge of the Unseen with You, that You make the Quran the life of my 
    heart and the light of my breast, and a departure for my sorrow and a 
    release for my anxiety),’ but Allah will take away his distress and grief, 
    and replace it with joy.” (Narrated by al-Imam Ahmad, 3704; it is a saheeh

The first category is that which is called umooday al-nasab (lit. the two pillars of lineage) i.e. the direct line of ascent and descent, not matter how far they reach. [This means parents, grandparents, great-grandparents etc, in the line of ascent, and children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, etc., in the line of descent - Translator]. Spending on them is obligatory when the following two conditions apply:


That the one on whom money is spent is poor and does not have anything or does not have enough, and is not able to earn a living.


That the one who is spending money can afford it and has enough, more than what he and his spouse need for their own sustenance.


There is also a third condition: that both parties should share the same religion (i.e., they should both be Muslims, for example).
The second category is all other relatives apart from those in the direct line of ascent or descent. In cases where spending on them is obligatory, in addition to the two conditions mentioned above, there is a third condition: which is that the one who spends money should be a legal heir (according to shareeah) of the person on whom he is spending, i.e. he can inherit from him. On this basis, if your father and paternal uncles are able to spend, then it is their duty to spend on your grandmother and paternal aunts.
But do not forget the matter of kind treatment, for charity given to relatives is both charity and an upholding of kinship ties, and so it will bring two rewards. Do not forget what Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
and whatsoever you spend of anything (in Allaahs cause) He will replace it. And He is the Best of providers. [Saba 34:39]
Spending on ones relatives, especially one's mother, is one of the greatest means by virtue of which Allaah will send more provision and blessings, alongside the great reward which is with Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted.
So you should be happy that your father is spending on his mother and sisters, and you should encourage him to do that and compete with your uncles in doing this good deed.
As for the amount of money to be spent, this is determined by the ability of the person who is spending and the needs of the people on whom he is spending. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
They ask you (O Muhammad) what they should spend. Say: whatever you spend of good must be for parents and kindred and orphans and al-masaakeen (the poor) and wayfarers, and whatever you do of good deeds, truly, Allaah knows it well. [al-Baqarah 2:215]

  of them, Maalik, Al-Shaafai and Ahmad: if a person persists until he is 
  killed, is he killed as a kaafir and an apostate, or as a sinful Muslim like 
  other sinful Muslims, as stated in the two well-known views reported from Ahmad? 
  Such detailed discussion was not reported from the Sahaabah, and is excessive 
  and futile.
If the person believes in his heart that prayer is obligatory, 
  this will not allow him to persist in not doing it until he is executed. Such 
  a thing is not known among the sons of Adam, and has never happened in Islam. 
  It is unheard of for a person to believe that it is obligatory and to be told, 
  If you do not pray we will execute you and then to persist in not 
  doing it even though he believes it is obligatory. This has never happened in 
  Islam.
When a person refrains from praying until he is executed, he 
  does not really believe in his heart that it is obligatory and was not doing 
  it, so he is a kaafir, according to the consensus of the Muslims, as it was 
  stated in many reports that the Sahaabah would consider such a person to be 
  a kaafir. This is also indicated by the saheeh texts, such as the ahadeeth of 
  the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
  him): 
Nothing stands between a person and Kufr except his giving 
  up prayer (narrated by Muslim).
The covenant that separates us from them is prayer, and 
  whoever gives up prayer has become a kaafir.
Abd-Allaah ibn Shaqeeq said: The companions of 
  Muhammad did not think that giving up any deed would make a person a kaafir 
   apart from giving up prayer.
Whoever persists in not praying and never prostrated to Allaah 
  at all until he dies, can never be a Muslim who believes that prayer is obligatory. 
  Believing that it is obligatory and that the person who does not do it deserves 
  to be executed is sufficient motive to make a person do it, for if a person 
  has the motive and ability to do something, it should be done. If he is able 
  to do it but he never does it, this indicates that the motive is not present 
  in his case.

6044,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6044,Reading and    writing fantasy stories,"Is it permissible in Islam to read and write fantasy novels and stories? Fantasy here refers to princesses, castles, magic and things you would find in a fairy tale, for instance.",,,"Praise be to Allah.1. With regard to reading these stories, this is a waste of time. People are deceived by the idea of “free” time, for it is one of the things about which they will be questioned on the Day of Resurrection.
It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There are two blessings which many people do not make the most of: good health and free time.”
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6049)
Abu Barzah al-Aslami said: the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “A person will not be let go on the Day of Resurrection until he has been asked about his life and how he spent it, his knowledge and what he did with it, his wealth and from where he earned it and where he spent it, and his body and how he used it.”
(Narrated and classed as saheeh by al-Tirmidhi, 2417)
2. As for writing these stories, in addition to the above point that it is a waste of time, it also involves a second forbidden matter, which is lying; lying cannot be avoided if one is to write in an attractive and compelling manner about things that do not exist.
If a person has to write, then let him write about something that is real and happens in the lives of people nowadays, writing about things that really happened to him or to others, from which lessons can be drawn. Or let him write by way of giving examples and allegories, stating that in an introduction. Even better than that, let him write about the true and sound stories that have been narrated in the Qur’aan and Sunnah, or about the lives and biographies of great Islamic personalities such as the Prophets, scholars and righteous people, or stories of earlier nations of whom Allah has told us, in an exciting and interesting style in which there is no distortion or addition of things that did not happen and things of which the author has no knowledge. They should also be narrated in an easy and straightforward style that is appropriate for children, and in his books he should promote good character and virtue.

There is no difference between answering the call of nature in the middle of a graveyard or in the middle of the marketplace.” (Ibn Maajah). In al-Zawaa’id it says that its isnaad is saheeh, and in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel (63) it is classed as Saheeh. “Or repair my shoes using my own feet” – this is something that is extremely difficult and if it were possible it would be very painful indeed, but despite all that it is still preferable to walking on the grave of a Muslim. “There is no difference between answering the call of nature in the middle of a graveyard or in the middle of the marketplace” – means that both actions are equally repulsive, and whoever does one will not refrain from doing the other.

      muslim. i am having hard time deciding what to do. its hard for me to stay muslim because
      i live in non muslim society and the muslims i know are not really muslims .
      do you have any suggestions ?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Your problem is a sensitive and serious problem that has to do with
    adhering to Islam and following its rules. Whilst we understand your problem and feel your
    suffering from afar, we want to remind you of the following points:
Firstly, this something that you say comes to you and tells
    you that you have to be a Muslim could be one of the angels, because the Prophet 
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The Shaytaan has some hold over
    the son of Adam and the angel has some hold over the son of Adam. As for the hold of the
    shaytaan, it is reminding him of evil and disbelieving the truth. As for the hold of the
    angel, it is reminding him of goodness and believing the truth. Whoever find the latter,
    let him know that it is from Allaah, so let him praise Allaah. Whoever finds the former,
    let him seek refuge with Allaah from the accursed Shaytaan. Then he recited
    (interpretation of the meaning): Shaytaan (Satan) threatens you with poverty and
    orders you to commit Fahsha (evil deeds, illegal sexual intercourse, sins); whereas Allaah
    promises you forgiveness from Himself and bounty [al-Baqarah 2:268].
    (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 2914; he said it is a ghareeb hasan hadeeth).
Shaytaan here refers to Iblees or one of his troops.
    A hold (literally, touch) means coming close and having an effect. Here it
    refers to what happens in the heart as a result of the influence of the devil or angel.
    Reminding him of evil such as Kufr (disbelief), immorality and wrongdoing.
    Disbelieving the truth means denying the rights of Allaah or the rights of
    creation, or denying something that has been proven to be truesuch as Tawheed,
    Prophethood, Resurrection, the Day of Judgement and Paradise and Hell. As for the
    hold of the angel, it is reminding him of goodness such as prayer and fasting.
    And believing in the truth such as the Books and Messengers of Allaah.
    Whoever finds that means in himself, or notices or recognizes it, i.e., the
    hold of the angel. Let him know that it is from Allaah means it is a great
    blessing and wonderful mercy that has come to him because Allaah commanded the angel to
    touch him. Let him praise Allaah for this great blessing, because it has
    qualified him to be guided by the angel to this goodness. Whoever finds the
    former means the hold of shaytaan. Then he recited means the Prophet
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) he quoted the aayah (interpretation of
    the meaning): Shaytaan (Satan) threatens you with poverty means he
    scares you with it to stop you spending in good ways. and orders you to commit
    Fahsha (evil deeds, etc.) means sins.
In the light of this great hadeeth, you can now understand your
    situation. The something that is bringing you goodness is bringing you a
    blessing from Allaah, so give thanks and praise to Allaah for it. The other one who is
    coming to entice you to go out and dance and form illicit relationships with evil, dirty
    people is from the Shaytaan, so seek refuge with Allaah from that every time he tempts you
    with these evil dangers. 
Secondly, do not worry about there being so many lost souls around you,
    do not let these hordes of kaafirs who are drowning in the sea of their reckless desires
    and sins distract you from the purpose for which you were created. Allaah says
    (interpretation of the meaning):
And if you obey most of those on the earth, they will mislead
    you far away from Allaahs path (al-Anaam 6:116)
And most of mankind will not believe even if you desire it
    eagerly (Yoosuf 12:103)
O young Muslim woman, what is the value of life if a person lives only
    to follow his or her own desires, steeped in vice, dancing and singing, getting drunk and
    causing uproar, engaging in illicit sexual conduct and behaving like an animal? Allaah
    says (interpretation of the meaning):
They are like cattle, nay even more astray; those! They are
    the heedless ones (al-Anaam 6:179).
Thirdly, as you are living in a negative atmosphere filled with so many
    kuffaar and Muslims who do not adhere to their religion and who may not know anything
    about Islam other than its name, and surrounded with trials and temptations as you are,
    you have to cling to Allaah and adhere to His shareeah (laws), turn to Him and pray
    always to Him to protect you from sin and help you to adhere to your religion. Always
    repeat this duaa: Yaa muqallib al-quloob thabbit qalbi ala deenak
    (O Controller of the hearts, make my heart adhere firmly to Your religion). Because
    your mother, the Mother of the Believers Aaishah (may Allaah be pleased with
    her) narrated from her husband, your Prophet Muhammad  (peace and blessings of Allaah
    be upon him) that he used to recite this duaa (Yaa muqallib al-quloob
    thabbit qalbi ala deenak) frequently. She asked, O Messenger of Allaah, we
    believe in you and in what you have brought. Do you fear for us? He said, Yes,
    for peoples hearts are between the fingers of Allaah and He turns them as He
    wills. (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2066. He said, this is a hasan hadeeth).
Fourthly, try to look for other Muslim women so that you can remind one
    another of the truth and encourage one another to be patient. Do whatever you can to call
    your parents to the way of truth, for how many young people have been the cause of their
    elders being guided!
Finally we ask Allaah to guide you in the ways of peace and to make you
    steadfast on the path of Islam and to bless you with the sweetness of faith. We entrust
    you to the care of Allaah, for those who are under His care will never be lost.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

If she was unaware of this ruling, then I hope that she will be excused, and she has to seek the forgiveness of Allah. If she was aware of it, then she has to repent and seek the forgiveness of Allah.
But there is another question to be asked, which is: does this Hajj count as the obligatory Hajj required in Islam?
If she had reached the age of puberty when she did that Hajj, then it does count as the obligatory Hajj required in Islam, even if she went without a mahram. If she had not yet reached the age of puberty, then she has to go for Hajj again, and her first Hajj will count as naafilah (supererogatory). What is meant by puberty is the appearance of one of the signs of puberty, such as the onset of menstruation, the growth of body hair (in the armpits and pubic area), or “wet dreams” (following which one detects the emission of fluid from the private parts). It is most likely that a woman of fourteen years of age had reached puberty.

6083,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6083,Are the words spoken in a state of spiritual intoxication forgiven?,"hamza yusuf said, when speaking about the fears people have about sufism ,""the fourth reason is fear for the generality that they might be lead astray by following esoteric doctrines without upholding the letter of the law as happens to many ignorant people. so ignorant people might hear some statement which is said by a sufi and they completely misunderstand it. and abu yazid al-bistami put in imam dhahabi's tabaqat is considered a faqih (jurisprudent). imam dhahabi is considered a student of ibn taymiyya and he considers abu yazid al-bistami a reasonable and sound source of hadith. yet abu yazid al-bistami is the one who is noted for saying 'subhanee' which means 'glory to me!' this is known in the technical vocabulary of the sufis as a shatha, an ecstatic utterance. if a person says it in a state in which their self is absent they are not taken to account for it we have proof of it in sahih bukhari about a slave in the middle of a desert in which the prophet (s) says that because he finds his lost beast he shouts out in joy 'allah you are my slave and i am your lord!' the prophet explained that that slave made a mistake in his ecstatic state after finding his animal. this is someone who finds their animal, so how much greater for someone who has found his lord?! what about his state of ecstasy?  

does the hadith in bukhari mean that blasphemous utterences are excused if someone is in a so called state of “spiritual intoxication”?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Abu Yazeed al-Bistaami is Tayfoor ibn ‘Eesa, 
    d. 261 AH. 
He is not known to have studied hadeeth. 
    Al-Dhahabi did not state that about him in his biography. Rather he mentioned something about him which could be taken as meaning that he mocked 
    Ahl al-Hadeeth and claimed to get his knowledge directly from Allaah! That is that he said, “Who do these muhaddithoon (hadeeth scholars) think 
    they are? If a man narrated to another man, our heart has narrated to us from the Lord!” 
Many shatahaat (ecstatic utterances) have 
    been narrated from him, such as his saying “There is nothing inside this cloak except Allaah” and “What is the Fire? I will lean on it tomorrow 
    and say, ‘Make me a sacrifice for its people, otherwise I am going to swallow it’” and, “What is Paradise? It is a children’s game and the desire 
    of the people of this world.” 
Because of these statements, which appear to 
    be kufr and heresy, some of the scholars ruled that his beliefs were corrupt and that he was an innovator, but other scholars excused him. 
Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    said: It was narrated that he uttered some weird shatahaat, for which many of the fuqaha’ and Sufis tried to find acceptable interpretations by 
    explaining them in a far-fetched manner. Some of them said that he spoke these words in a state of oblivion. Some of the scholars labeled him an 
    innovator and said that he was wrong, and they said that this was a major form of bid’ah, and that it was indicative of corrupt beliefs that were 
    entrenched in his heart and manifested themselves at certain times. 
Al-Badaayah wa’l-Nahaayah, 
    11/38 
If you refer to Siyar A’laam al-Nubala’ 
    by al-Dhahabi you will see that al-Dhahabi did not describe Abu Yazeed as a faqeeh, and he did not regard him as a source of hadeeth. Rather he 
    narrated some good words from him, and he also narrated these shatahaat from him, and said: 
There were narrated from him – i.e., from Abu 
    Yazeed – some weird things that cannot be accepted. If it is proven that he said them, or that he said them in a state of oblivion and ecstasy, 
    then they should be overlooked and should not be quoted as evidence, because their apparent meaning is heresy, such as “Glory be to me” and “There 
    is nothing in this cloak except Allaah” and “What is the Fire? I will lean on it tomorrow and say, ‘Make me a sacrifice for its people, otherwise 
    I am going to swallow it’” and, “What is Paradise? It is a children’s game and the desire of the people of this world.” 
Siyar A’laam al-Nubala’, 
    13/88 
Perhaps the reason why some of the scholars 
    tried to make excuses for him is the fact that some good words have been narrated from him, which encourage following sharee’ah and adhering to 
    the limits it sets, and the fact that it is narrated that when he came around (from his state of oblivion), he denied these shatahaat. 
See Manhaaj al-Sunnah, 5/357; 
    Madaarij al-Saalikeen, 2/119 
It should also be noted that at best, the one 
    who says such words may be excused for them and not blamed for them. It is not correct to take these words as a sign of being a wali (“saint”) or 
    having attained a high degree of knowledge. 
Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah] said: 
Those who quote Abu Yazeed as saying that he 
    was united with the Creator and denied that there was any difference between him and the Creator, and excuse him for that, say that he became 
    oblivious to the extent that he said “I am the truth” and “Glory be to me” and “There is nothing in this cloak except Allaah”. They say that when 
    love overwhelms a person who is weak, he loses his mind and can only think of his beloved and is unaware of anything else; he will only think of 
    the One Who created him and will no longer be aware of his own existence, focusing so completely on the One Whom he is remembering and not aware 
    of what he is doing at all. When a person reaches that state, he can no longer see any distinction between the Lord and the slave, between what is 
    enjoined and what is forbidden. This is not a state in which a person can produce knowledge or speak sense, rather the best that we can say is 
    that he has lost control of his mental faculties by which he can distinguish between this and that, and at best he is to be excused and what he 
    says cannot be considered to be deep insight or knowledge. 
Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 
    8/313 
Moreover, this excuse can only be accepted 
    when a man reaches that state of oblivion involuntarily. If he does it deliberately, however, he is undoubtedly to be blamed for doing that, such 
    as if he drinks alcohol or starts to dance in the circle of dhikr until he reaches a state of oblivion. 
Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah] said: 
But some of those who have this experience 
    may become intoxicated and irrational when in that state of oblivion, in which state they may say things like “Glory be to me” or “There is 
    nothing in this cloak except Allaah” and other such words that were narrated from Abu Yazeed al-Bistaami. Whatever an intoxicated person says is 
    to be overlooked; it should not be narrated or told to others, if his intoxication has not come about through haraam means such as forbidden acts 
    of worship or performing acts of worship in ways that are not allowed. But if the cause of intoxication is something haraam, then the intoxicated 
    person is no longer to be excused. In this regard there is no difference between physical and spiritual intoxication. 
Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 
    2/461 
But praising such words, or praising the words 
    of the man who in his intense joy made a mistake and said, “O Allaah, You are my slave and I am your Lord” is a serious error. How can we praise 
    such words when the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) has described them as a mistake, as he said, “He made a mistake 
    because of the intensity of his joy”? 
These words indicate that a person is not 
    aware of what he is saying, or that he has completely lost control of his mental faculties. How can losing control of one's faculties be regarded 
    as something praiseworthy or a sign of perfection or “sainthood” (wilaayah)?! 
The companions of the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) were the most perfect of mankind, after the Prophets, in their fear of Allaah and their hopes in Him. They 
    attained the status of true slaves and close friends of Allaah. But it is not narrated that they uttered such words, because of their perfect 
    wisdom and perfect following of sharee’ah. May Allaah be pleased with them all.",Islam Q&A

observe that the holy prophet(sallal lahu alaihi wasallam) is being called a witness to all the nations that allah has put upon this earth. therefore, the holy prophet(sallal lahu alaihi wasallam) must have been present before his earthly appearance and is still present after this earthly demise, otherwise he cannot be called upon as a witness in the true sense of the word. there are many other verses of the holy quran that call upon the holy prophet(sallal lahu alaihi wasallam) to be a witness. and a witness can only be someone who is hazir & nazir.
a technical point: the following quranic verses are often quoted to show that the holy prophet(sallal lahu alaihi wasallam) was not present and seeing before his earthly appearance : ""and you('o' prophet) were not with them(present) when they cast their pens(to decide) which of them should be mary's guardian."" (s3 v44)

The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was a human being who suffered from sickness and real death the same as any other human being. Allah said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, you (O Muhammad) will die, and verily, they (too) will die.” [Az-Zumar 39:30] 
“And We granted not to any human being immortality before you (O Muhammad); then if you die, would they live forever?” [Al-Anbiya’ 21:34]
The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) died and was buried in his grave , hence Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Whoever used to worship Muhammad, Muhammad has died, but whoever used to worship Allah, Allah is alive and will never die.”
The fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was a witness , a bringer of glad tidings and a warner, and that he will be a witness on the Day of Resurrection, does not mean that he is present among all nations, or that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) will remain alive until the Day of Resurrection, or that he sees and witnesses while he is in his grave. Witnessing does not only mean seeing. Rather he will testify against the nations by means of what Allah tells him, for he does not know the unseen. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“… and If I had the knowledge of the Ghaib (Unseen), I should have secured for myself an abundance of wealth…” [Al-A`raf 7:188]

6090,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6090,The soul’s    connection to the body,Is there anything in Islam to explain the souls connection to the body?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:
The soul (al-rooh) is connected to the body in five different ways, to which different rules apply.

Its connection to the body as a foetus in his mothers womb.

Its connection to the body after a person is born.


Its connection to the body when a person is asleep, when the soul is connected in one way and separated from it in another way.


Its connection to the body in al-Barzakh (the period between a person's death and the Day of Resurrection), when it has departed from the body and separated from it, but is not separated completely in such a way that there is no connection at all. We have mentioned at the beginning of this reply that there are ahaadeeth and reports which indicate that the soul is returned to the body when somebody sends the greeting of salaam to a deceased person. This returning is of a special nature which does not mean that the life is restored to the body before the Day of Resurrection.


Its connection to the body on the Day when bodies will be resurrected. This is the most perfect type of connection to the body, and has no comparison to the previous types, because after that the body will never die, sleep or have anything wrong with it.


When a person is asleep, his soul is in his body and he is alive, although his being alive is not the same as that of a person who is awake, for sleep is comparable to death. Similarly, when a dead person's soul is returned to his body (when the greeting is sent upon him), he is in a state between one who is alive and one who is dead, whose soul is not restored to his body. This is like the case of a sleeping person who is in a state between life and death. We hope that this will dispel a lot of your confusion.","Kitaab al-Rooh, 44"

It was reported in a sahih hadith from the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that it is the greatest ayah in the Book of Allah… It was narrated from Ubayy, i.e., Ubayy ibn Ka’b that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked him which ayah in the Book of Allah was the greatest. He said, “Allah and His Messenger know best.” He repeated it several times, then he said, “Ayatul Kursi.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Congratulations upon your knowledge O Abu’l-Mundhir. By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, it has a tongue and two lips, and it glorifies the Sovereign (i.e., Allah) at the foot of the Throne.” This was also narrated by Muslim, without the phrase “By the One in Whose Hand is my soul…”.
Ayatul Kursi: Protection from the jinn
It was narrated from ‘Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy ibn Ka’b that his father told him that he had a vessel in which he kept dates. He used to check on it and found that the number was decreasing. So he kept guard on it one night and saw a beast that looked like an adolescent boy. He said: “I greeted him with salams and he returned my greeting, then I asked him, ‘What are you, a jinni or a human?’ He said, ‘A jinni.’ I said to him, ‘Show me your hand.’ So he showed me his hand, and it looked like a dog’s paw with dog’s fur. I said, ‘Do all the jinn look like this?’ He said, ‘I know no one among the jinn who is stronger than I.’ I said, ‘What made you do what you did [i.e., taking the dates]?’ He said, ‘We heard that you are a man who loves charity, and we wanted to have some of your food.’” Ubayy asked him, “What will protect us from you?” He said, “This ayah, Ayatul Kursi .” Then the next day he [Ubayy] went to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and told him (about what had happened) and he said, “The evil one spoke the truth.”…
Imam Ahmad narrated: Muhammad ibn Ja’far told us, ‘Uthman ibn ‘Itab told us, he said: I heard Abu’l-Sulayl saying: a man from among the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) addressed the people until a large number had gathered around him, then he climbed onto the roof of a house and addressed the people, saying: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ‘Which ayah of the Quran is the greatest?’ A man said, ‘ “Allah! La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the Ever Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists…” [al-Baqarah 2:255 – Ayatul Kursi – interpretation of the meaning].’ He said: he put his hand between my shoulders and I felt coolness in the centre of my chest, or he put his hand on the centre of my chest and I felt coolness between my shoulders, and he said, ‘Congratulations on your knowledge, O Abu’l-Mundhir.”
It was narrated that Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) whilst he was in the mosque and sat down. He said, ‘O Abu Dharr, did you pray?’ I said, ‘No.’ He said, ‘ Get up and pray.’ So I got up and prayed, then I came and sat down. He said, ‘O Abu Dharr, seek refuge with Allah from the devils of men and jinn.’ I said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, are there devils among men?’ He said, ‘Yes.’ I said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, what about salah?’ He said, ‘It is the best, so let whoever wants to, do a little of it and let whoever wants to, do more of it.’ I said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, what about fasting?’ He said, ‘It is obligatory and it is good, and the reward with Allah is greater.’ I said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, what about sadaqah (charity)?’ He said, ‘Allah multiplies it many times over.’ I said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, what (charity) is best?’ He said, ‘What a person gives at times of hardship, or what he gives in secret to a poor person.’ I said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, which of the prophets was first?’ He said, ‘Adam.’ I said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, was he a prophet?’ He said, ‘Yes, a prophet to whom Allah spoke.’ I said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, how many messengers are there?’ He said. ‘Three hundred and umpteen, a great crowd.’ And once he said, ‘(Three hundred and) fifteen.’ I said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, what is the greatest thing that has been revealed to you?’ He said, ‘Ayatul Kursi, “Allah! La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the Ever Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists…” [al-Baqarah 2:255 – interpretation of the meaning].’” (Narrated by al-Nasai).
 Al-Bukhari narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) appointed me to guard the Ramadan zakah. Someone came and started taking some of the food. I grabbed hold of him and said, ‘I am going to take you to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)!’ He said, ‘Let me be, for I am in need and I have children and am in great need.’ So I let him go. The following morning, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ‘O Abu Hurayrah, what did your prisoner do last night?’ I said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, he complained of being in great need and having children to look after, so I took pity on him and let him go.’ He said, ‘But he was lying, and he will be back.’ So I knew that he would come back, because of what the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had said. I lay in wait for him, and he came and started taking some of the food. I grabbed hold of him and said, ‘I am going to take you to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)!’ He said, ‘Let me be, for I am in need and I have children. I will not come back again.’ So I took pity on him and let him go. The following morning, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ‘O Abu Hurayrah, what did your prisoner do last night?’ I said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, he complained of being in great need and having children to look after, so I took pity on him and let him go.’ He said, ‘But he was lying, and he will be back.’ So I lay in wait for him on the third night, and he came and started taking some of the food. I grabbed hold of him and said, ‘I am going to take you to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)! This is the third and last time. You said that you would not come back, then you did come back.’ He said, ‘Let me go, and I will teach you some words by which Allah will benefit you.’ I said, ‘What are they?” He said, ‘When you lie down in your bed, recite Ayatul Kursi, “Allah! La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the Ever Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists…” [al-Baqarah 2:255 – interpretation of the meaning] until the end of the ayah, then you will have a protector from Allah and no shaytan (devil) will come near you until morning comes.’ Then I let him go. The following morning, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ‘What did your prisoner do last night?’ I said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, he claimed that he would teach me some words by which he said Allah would benefit me, then I let him go.’ He asked, ‘What are they?’ I said, ‘He told me, when you lie down in your bed, recite Ayatul Kursi, from the beginning to the end of the ayah, “Allah! La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the Ever Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists…” [al-Baqarah 2:255 – interpretation of the meaning]. And he told me, you will have a protector from Allah and no shaytan (devil) will come near you until morning comes.’ And they [the Sahabah] were always keen to do good.’ The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘He indeed told you the truth, although he is a liar. Do you know who you have been speaking with for the past three nights, O Abu Hurayrah?’ I said, ‘No.’ He said, ‘That was a shaytan (a devil).’”
 According to another report, “… ‘I was taking food to a very poor family among the jinn.’ So he let him go, and he came back on the second night and then the third night. I said, ‘Did you not promise me that you would not come back? I will not leave you today until I bring you to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).’ He said, ‘Do not do that. If you let me go, I will teach you some words which, if you say them, no one among the jinn, great or small, male or female, will come near you.’ He said, ‘Will you do that?’ He said, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘What are they?’ He said, ‘“Allah! La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the Ever Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists…” [al-Baqarah 2:255 – interpretation of the meaning], and recited Ayatul Kursi until the end. So he let him go and he went away and did not come back. Abu Hurayrah told the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about that, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him: “Did you not know that before?” This was narrated by al-Nasai from Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn ‘Ubayd-Allah from Shu’ayb ibn Harb from Isma’il ibn Muslim from Abu’l-Mutawakkil from Abu Hurayrah. We have noted above that something similar happened to Ubayy ibn Ka’b, so these are three separate incidents. Abu ‘Ubayd said in Kitab al-Gharib: Abu Mu’awiyah told us, from Abu ‘Asim al-Qaffi, from al-Shu’bi from ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ud, who said: “A man from among the humans went out and was met by a man from among the jinn, who said, ‘Will you wrestle with me? If you throw me to the ground I will teach you an ayah which, if you recite it when you enter your house, no shaytan will enter.’ So he wrestled with him and threw him to the ground. He said, ‘I see that you are very small and your forearms are like the front paws of a dog. Are all the jinn like this, or only you?’ He said, ‘I am strong among them. Let us wrestle again.’ So they wrestled again and the human threw him to the ground. So he (the jinni) said, ‘Recite Ayatul Kursi, for no one recites it when he enters his house, but the Shaytan leaves, farting like a donkey.’” It was said to Ibn Mas’ud, “Was that man ‘Umar?” He said, “Who else could it have been, other than ‘Umar?” …
Ayatul Kursi: It is never recited in a house but the Shaytan leaves
It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “In Surah al-Baqarah there is an ayah which is the best of all the ayats of the Quran. It is never recited in a house but the Shaytan leaves: Ayatul Kursi.” This was also narrated via another isnad, from Zaidah from Hakim ibn Jubayr. Then he said, its isnad is sahih although they [al-Bukhari and Muslim] did not narrate it. It was also narrated by al-Tirmidhi from the hadith of Zaidah, with the wording, “Everything has its pinnacle and the pinnacle of the Quran is Surah al-Baqarah. In it there is an ayah which is the greatest in the Quran: Ayatul Kursi.” Then he said: (it is) gharib, we do not know it except from the hadith of Hakim ibn Jubayr. Shu’bah discussed it and classed it as da’if (weak). It was also classed as da’if by Ahmad, Yahya ibn Ma'in and other imams. Ibn Mahdi classed it as matruk and al-Sa’di classed it as false.
It was narrated from Ibn ‘Umar that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab went out one day to some people who had prepared a meal. He said, “Who among you can tell me which is the greatest ayah in the Quran?”  Ibn Mas’ud said, “You are asking one who knows. I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say, ‘The greatest ayah in the Quran is ‘Allah! La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the Ever Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists…’ [al-Baqarah 2:255 – interpretation of the meaning].”
Ayatul Kursi contains the greatest name of Allah
Concerning the fact that it includes the greatest name of Allah, Imam Ahmad said: “It was narrated that Asma bint Yazid ibn al-Sakan said: ‘I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say about these two ayahs (interpretation of the meanings) -- “Allah! La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the Ever Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists…” [al-Baqarah 2:255] and “Alif-Lam-Mim. [These letters are one of the miracles of the Quran, and none but Allah (Alone) knows their meanings.] Allah! La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), Al-Hayyul-Qayyum (the Ever Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists)” [Al 'Imran 3:1-2] – that they contain the greatest name of Allah.’” This was  also narrated by Abu Dawud from Musaddid and by al-Tirmidhi from ‘Ali ibn Khashram, and by Ibn Majah from Abu Bakr ibn Abi Shaybah, all three of them narrating from ‘Isa ibn Yunus from ‘Ubayd-Allah ibn Abi Ziyad . Al-Tirmidhi said: it is sahih hasan.
 It was narrated in a marfu’ report that Abu Umamah said: “The greatest name of Allah, which if He is called by it, He responds, is in three (surahs): Surat al-Baqarah, Al ‘Imran and Ta-Ha.” Hisham, i.e., Ibn ‘Ammar, the khatib of Damascus, said: “In al-Baqarah, it is ‘Allah! La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the Ever Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exist’  [al-Baqarah 2:255 – interpretation of the meaning]. In Al ‘Imran it is ‘Alif-Lam-Mim. [These letters are one of the miracles of the Quran, and none but Allah (Alone) knows their meanings.] Allah! La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), Al-Hayyul-Qayyum (the Ever Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists)’ [Al ‘Imran 3:1-2 – interpretation of the meaning]. And in Ta-Ha it is ‘And (all) faces shall be humbled before (Allah), Al-Hayyul-Qayyum (the Ever Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists)’ [Ta-Ha 20:111].”
Benefits of reciting Ayatul Kursi after prayer
Concerning the virtue of reciting this ayah after the prescribed prayers , it was narrated that Abu Umamah said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever recites Ayatul Kursi immediately after each prescribed prayer, there will be nothing standing between him and his entering Paradise except death.” This is how it was narrated by al-Nasai in al-Yawm wa’l-Laylah, from al-Hasan ibn Bishr. It was also narrated by Ibn Hibban in his Sahih from Muhammad ibn Humayr, who is al-Homsi, and is also one of the men of al-Bukhari. The isnad meets the conditions of al-Bukhari.
