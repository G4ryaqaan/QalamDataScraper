50005,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50005,Ruling on Fasting While Breastfeeding,Is it permissible for my wife who is breastfeeding my ten-month-old son not to fast during Ramadan?,"It is not permissible for a pregnant woman or breastfeeding woman not to fast unless they have an excuse. If they do not fast because they have an excuse, they have to make up for the missed fasts.",,"Praise be to Allah.With regard to breastfeeding mothers – and also pregnant women – two scenarios may apply: 
1- If the woman is not affected by fasting, and fasting is not too difficult for her, and she does not fear for her child, then she is obliged to fast, and it is not permissible for her not to fast. 
2- If the woman fears for herself or her child because of fasting , and fasting is difficult for her, then she is allowed not to fast, but she has to make up for the days that she does not fast. 
In this situation it is better for her not to fast , and it is makruh for her to fast. Some of the scholars stated that if she fears for her child, it is obligatory for her not to fast and it is haram for her to fast. 
Al-Mirdawi said in al-Insaf (7/382): 
“It is makruh for her to fast in this case… Ibn ‘Aqil said: If a pregnant woman or a breastfeeding mother fears for her pregnancy or her child, then it is not permissible for her to fast in this case, but if she does not fear for her child then it is not permissible for her not to fast.” 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked in Fatawa al-Siyam (p. 161): 
If a pregnant woman or breastfeeding mother does not fast with no excuse, and she is strong and in good health, and is not affected by fasting, what is the ruling on that? 
He replied: 
“It is not permissible for a pregnant woman or breastfeeding woman not to fast during the day in Ramadan unless they have an excuse. If they do not fast because they have an excuse, then they have to make up the missed fasts, because Allah says concerning one who is sick (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number [of days which one did not observe Sawm (fasts) must be made up] from other days.” [al-Baqarah 2:185]
Pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers come under the same heading as those who are sick. If their excuse is that they fear for the child, then as well as making up for the missed fasts, according to some scholars they also have to feed one poor person for each day missed, giving wheat, rice, dates or any other staple food. 
Some of the scholars said that all they have to do is make up the missed fasts, no matter what the situation, because there is no evidence in the Quran or Sunnah for giving food in this case, and the basic principle is that there is no obligation unless proof of that is established. This is the view of Abu Hanهfah (may Allah have mercy on him) and it is a strong view.” 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was also asked in Fatawa al-Siyam (p. 162) about a pregnant woman who fears for herself or her child, and does not fast – what is the ruling? 
He replied by saying: 
“Our answer to this is that one of two scenarios must apply in the case of a pregnant woman. 
The first is if she is healthy and strong, and does not find fasting difficult, and it does not affect her fetus. In this case the woman is obliged to fast, because she has no excuse not to do so. 
The second is where the pregnant woman is not able to fast, either because the pregnancy is advanced or because she is physically weak, or for some other reason. In this case she should not fast, especially if her fetus is likely to be harmed, in which case it may be obligatory for her not to fast. If she does not fast, then like others who do not fast for a valid reason, she has to make up for the days when that excuse no longer applies. When she gives birth, she has to make up for those fasts after she becomes pure from nifas. But sometimes the excuse of pregnancy may be lifted but then immediately followed by another excuse, namely breastfeeding. The breastfeeding mother may need food and drink, especially during the long summer days when it is very hot. So she may need not to fast so that she can nourish her child with her milk. In this case we also say to her: Do not fast, and when this excuse no longer applies, then you should make up for the fasts that you have missed.” 
Shaykh Ibn Baz said in Majmu’ al-Fatawa (15/224): 
“With regard to pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers, it is proven in the hadith of Anas ibn Malik al-Ka’bi, narrated by Ahmad and the authors of al-Sunan with a sahih isnad, that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) granted them a dispensation allowing them not to fast, and he regarded them as being like travelers. From this it is known that they may not fast but they have to make up the fasts later, just like travelers. The scholars stated that they are only allowed not to fast if fasting is too difficult for them, as in the case of one who is sick, or if they fear for their children. And Allah knows best.” 
It says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah (10/226): 
“The pregnant woman is obliged to fast during her pregnancy, unless she fears that fasting may affect her or her fetus, in which case she is allowed not to fast, and she should make up the fasts after she gives birth and becomes pure from nifas.”

50008,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50008,Is it better for her to break her fast so she can breastfeed her child or to stop breastfeeding so she can fast?,"I have a son who is ten months old. Now the month of Ramadan has come and I want to fast the month, but a few days ago I started to fast on Mondays and Thursdays and I became very tired. Is it permissible for me to stop breastfeeding my child so that I can fast, or is it better for me not to fast so I can breastfeed my child?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
In question 50005 we have already stated that if a breastfeeding mother or pregnant woman fears for herself or her child, then it is better for her not to fast and fasting is makrooh in her case. Indeed some of the scholars said that if she fears for her child it is haram for her to fast and she should not fast, because she has no right to do something that would harm her child. 
Secondly: 
If the child is able to do without his mother’s milk then she should fast because there is no need for her not to fast in this case. 
Al-Mirdaawi said in al-Insaaf (7/383): 
If the child is able to do without his mother’s milk, it is not permissible for her not to fast. 
Thirdly: 
If what you mean in your question by “stop breastfeeding my child” is weaning him, that depends on the child’s situation. If he will be harmed by that, it is not permissible to do it; if he will not be harmed by it, then there is nothing wrong with weaning him, after you consult with his father and agree on that, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The mothers shall give suck to their children for two whole years, (that is) for those (parents) who desire to complete the term of suckling, but the father of the child shall bear the cost of the mother’s food and clothing on a reasonable basis. No person shall have a burden laid on him greater than he can bear. No mother shall be treated unfairly on account of her child, nor father on account of his child. And on the (father’s) heir is incumbent the like of that (which was incumbent on the father). If they both decide on weaning, by mutual consent, and after due consultation, there is no sin on them”
[al-Baqarah 2:233]
 al-Qurtubi said: 
The phrase “If they both decide on weaning” means weaning the child from the breast, i.e., weaning him from his mother’s milk to other kinds of food. “by mutual consent” means, before two years have passed. “there is no sin on them” means, in weaning him, because Allah has stipulated that the period of breastfeeding should be two years, except when the parents agree on a shorter period, so long as that is not harmful to the child. That is permissible according to this statement. 
Ibn Jareer narrated in al-Tafseer (3913) that Sufyaan al-Thawri said: If the father wants to wean him before two years, and his wife does not agree, then he does not have the right to enforce that. If the woman says, I want to wean him before two years, but the father says no, then she does not have the right to wean him unless the father approves and they reach an agreement. If they reach an agreement before two years, they may wean him, but if they disagree then they should not wean him before two years, as Allah says: “If they both decide on weaning, by mutual consent, and after due consultation”. 
But if what is meant is switching the child from breast milk to formula, this affects the interests of the child by denying him natural breast milk, and the importance of natural breastfeeding to the child has been proven beyond any shadow of a doubt. In this case the mother should not give up natural breastfeeding in order to fast, because formula milk cannot completely replace breast milk. The importance of breastfeeding is sufficient excuse for her not to fast. See also question no. 20759.

Benefits of listening to Quran while sleeping","Praise be to Allah.Can you listen to Quran while sleeping?
There is nothing wrong with a Muslim listening to Quran before he sleeps , or listening to a lecture or anything permissible. Indeed it is narrated in the sahih Sunnah that among the adhkar to be recited before going to sleep are some du`as and verses and Surahs from the Quran . 
Al-Bukhari said: 
Chapter: Seeking refuge with Allah and reciting Quran when going to sleep 
`Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) narrated that when the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went to bed, he would blow into his hands and recite the Mu’awwadhat, and wipe his body with them. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5960)
Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) appointed me to guard the zakah of Ramadan, and someone came and started to rummage in the food. I took hold of him and said: “I am going to take you to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)”… And he said: “When you go to your bed, recite Ayat al-Kursi, and you will have ongoing protection from Allah and no devil will come near you until morning comes.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “He spoke the truth even though he is a liar; that was a devil.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3101) 
Benefits of listening to Quran while sleeping
Listening to Quran before going to sleep and after, during Ramadan and at other times, instills tranquility in the heart and helps one relax. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):  
“Verily, in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest.” [Al-Ra’d 13:28]

I always pay my zakah in Ramadan. Should I pay zakah on these two debts? Is it permissible for me to use it to feed fasting people or to establish a charitable waqf for a library for da’wah?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
The scholars of the Standing Committee said: 
If the debtor is in difficulty or he has sufficient funds but he is taking a long time to pay back the loan, and the lender cannot get his money back from him – either because he does not have proof that will help him get it back through the authorities or he has proof but he cannot find any authority figure to help him get his rights – as happens in some countries where there is no support for people’s rights – then the lender does not have to pay zakah until he gets his money back and one full hijri year has passed since he got it. 
But if the debtor has sufficient funds and it is possible to get the money back from him, then the lender has to pay zakah every time a full hijri year has passed, if the loan reaches the nisaab by itself or when added to other money, etc.
Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah li’l-Buhooth al-‘Ilmiyyah wa’l-Ifta, 9/191 
Secondly: 
If zakah is due on a person’s wealth, it is not permissible for him to dispose of it except in the ways prescribed in sharee’ah, which are explained in the answer to question no. 6977. It is not permissible to use zakah to feed the fasting or to establish a charitable waqf, because these are not among the eight areas in which zakah is to be spent, as defined by Allaah, may He be exalted. 
We have already explained that it is not permissible to use zakah funds to build mosques and schools, or to print Mus-hafs. See questions no. 13734  and 21797.

50016,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50016,Is it permissible to act as guarantor for a person taking a loan from the bank?,What is the Islamic ruling on acting as guarantor for a person taking a loan from the bank?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.If this loan is riba-based (as is the case with most banks), meaning that the bank will take interest from him, then it is not permissible for you to act as a guarantor for the borrower, because by doing so you are helping the borrower and the bank to engage in riba (usury, interest), which is forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, and which the Muslims are unanimously agreed is haraam. 
The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked about the ruling on sponsoring a person who wants to borrow from a riba-based bank. They replied: 
If the situation is as described, and the bank will charge interest on the loan, it is not permissible for the manager, the accountant or the treasurer to cooperate with them in that, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“do not help one another in sin and transgression”[al-Maa'idah 5:2]
And it was proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed the one who consumes riba, the one who pays it, the one who writes it down and the two who witness it, and he said: “They are all the same.”

50017,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50017,He masturbated not knowing that it invalidates the fast,"Allah enabled me to repent a year ago. Today I heard that masturbation is one of the things that invalidate the fast, which I did not know before. I have committed this sin in Ramadaan in the past. I do not know what to do. I don’t know how many times I committed this sin. Please advise me what I should do.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly:  
Who has guided you to repent. We ask Him to accept your repentance and forgive your sins and guide you. 
Secondly: 
The scholars differed concerning one who does an action that invalidates the fast not knowing that it does so – is his fast invalidated by that or not? There are two opinions. 
The first is that it does invalidate the fast. This is the view of al-Shaafa’i and Ahmad, but al-Shaafa’i made an exception in the case of one who is new in Islam or who grew up in a remote area far from knowledgeable people – in such cases it does not invalidate the fast. 
Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmoo’ (6/356): 
If a fasting person eats, drinks or has intercourse not knowing that it is haraam – if he is new in Islam or grew up in a remote area and was unaware that this is something that breaks the fast – then it does not invalidate his fast, because it is not a sin. He is like one who forgets, as described in the texts. But if he used to mix with the Muslims in such a way that had no excuse for not knowing that this breaks the fast, then his fast is invalidated, because of his negligence (and failure to seek knowledge). 
See al-Mughni, 4/368; al-Kaafi, 2/244 
This view was favoured by the scholars of the Standing Committee, who were asked about someone who masturbated during the day in Ramadaan and did not know that this is haraam, and he did not know how many days he committed this forbidden action. They replied: 
He has to make up the days when he broke his fast because of the “secret habit”, because it invalidates the fast. He should try to work out the number of days when he broke the fast. 
Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 10/258. 
The second opinion is that it does not invalidate his fast, just as the fast of one who forgets is not invalidated. 
This view was favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and Ibn al-Qayyim. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in al-Fataawa al-Kubra (2/19): 
If the fasting person does something that breaks the fast because he does not know that it is haraam, does he have to repeat the fast? According to two opinions in the madhhab of Ahmad, it seems that he does not have to make up any of those fasts, because accountability only comes until after the message reaches a person, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“this Qur’aan has been revealed to me that I may therewith warn you and whomsoever it may reach” [al-An’aam 6:19] 
“And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger (to give warning)” [al-Isra’ 17:15] 
“…in order that mankind should have no plea against Allah after the (coming of) Messengers” [al-Nisa’ 4:165]
There are several such verses in the Qur’aan, in which Allah states that He does not punish anyone until the message that was brought by the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) reaches him. Whoever knows that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah and believes in that, but does not know much of the message that he brought, will not be punished by Allah for that of which he did not hear, for He only punishes people for not believing after the message reaches them. This is the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) which narrated in many reports. It is proven in the books of saheeh that a number of the Sahaabah thought that the words of Allah “until the white thread appears to you distinct from the black thread” [al-Baqarah 2:187 – interpretation of the meaning] referred to a white string and a black string, so one of them would tie strings to his leg and eat until he could distinguish the one from the other.  The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained that what was meant by the white thread was the day, and by the black the night, but he did not command them to repeat their fasts. 
Ibn al-Qayyim said in I’laam al-Muwaqqi’een (4/66): 
He (meaning the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)) excused those who ate or drank deliberately during the day in Ramadaan, not by mistake, because they thought that the black and white threads referred to strings, so they would eat and drink until they could tell the one from the other when the day had begun. He excused them for that and did not tell them to make up the fasts, because of their misunderstanding. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was asked about a young man who masturbated in Ramadaan, not knowing that it breaks the fast, when he was overcome by desire – what is the ruling in this case? 
He replied: 
The ruling is that he does not have to do anything, because we have stated above that the fasting person does not break his fast unless three conditions are met: knowledge, remembering and wanting to do that thing. See question no. 28023. 
But I say that people should be patient in refraining from masturbation because it is haraam. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And those who guard their chastity (i.e. private parts, from illegal sexual acts)
6. Except from their wives or (the slaves) that their right hands possess, for then, they are free from blame;
7. But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors”
[al-Mu’minoon 23:5-7] 
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “O young men, whoever among you can afford to get married, let him do so, and whoever cannot then let him fast, for it will be a shield for him.”
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5065; Muslim, 1400. 
If masturbation were permissible the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would suggested it to people, because it is easier and because people find pleasure in it, unlike fasting which is difficult. But because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) suggested fasting, this indicates that masturbation is not permissible. 
Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 19/981. 
In order to be on the safe side, you should make up these days, and try to work out how many they are likely to be. 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz said in Majmoo’ al-Fataawa (15/304): 
If a person has intercourse during the day in Ramadaan and he is someone who is required to fast, because he is an adult of sound mind who is not traveling, out of ignorance (that it is haraam), the scholars differed concerning his case. Some of them said that he has to offer expiation, because he failed to ask and try to understand his religion. Other scholars said that he does not have to offer expiation because he was ignorant. Hence we know that in order to on the safe side you should offer expiation, because you failed to ask what is forbidden to you before you did what you did. 
So he (Shaykh Ibn Baaz) told him to offer expiation so as to be on the safe side, and the reason why expiation in this case was obligatory is because he broke the fast by having intercourse. Expiation is not required for any of the things that break the fast except intercourse during the day in Ramadaan, as previously stated in the answer to question no. 28023.",Islam Q&A

Why is it recommended to hasten to break the fast?


When to break your fast","Praise be to Allah.The sunnah is to hasten to break the fast
There is no reward for delaying breaking the fast, rather it is better to hasten to break the fast as soon as the sun has set ; this brings a more complete reward. 
Al-Bukhari (1957) and Muslim (1098) narrated from Sahl ibn Sa’d that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The people will continue to do well so long as they hasten to break the fast.” 
Abu Dawud (2353) narrated the same from Abu Hurayrah; his report includes the additional phrase, “… because the Jews and Christians delay it.” (Classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud, 2353) 
Al-Nawawi said: 
“This hadith urges us to hasten to break the fast as soon as it is established that the sun has set. What this means is that the ummah will continue to be in a sound state and they will be fine so long as they continue to adhere to this Sunnah. If they delay it, that will be a sign that corruption has arisen among them.” 
With regard to the words, “… because the Jews and Christians delay it,” al-Tibi said: 
“This reason indicates that the basis of the true monotheistic religion is the opposite of what its enemies among the People of the Book do, and that agreeing with them leads to doom and destruction.”  
Muslim (1099) narrated that `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) was asked about a man among the Companions of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) – ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ud – who hastened to pray Maghrib and break the fast. She said: This is what the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to do. 
Al-Shafi`i said in al-Umm: “Hastening to break the fast is mustahabb .” 
Ibn Hazm said in al-Muhalla (4/380): “It is Sunnah to hasten to break the fast and to delay suhur, i.e., when the sun disappears beneath the horizon of the fasting person and no more.”
Why is it recommended to hasten to break the fast?
The scholars have mentioned a number of reasons why it is recommended to hasten to break the fast, including the following: 

To be different from the Jews and Christians
To follow the Sunnah
So as not to make the day longer and take from the night
It is kinder to the fasting person and gives him more strength for worship
To hasten to eat that which Allah has permitted to him, for Allah is generous and the one who is generous likes to see people enjoying his generosity. So He likes His slaves to hasten to enjoy that which Allah has permitted to them as soon as the sun sets.

When to break your fast
The scholars unanimously agreed that the time for that is when it is established that the sun has set, by seeing it with one's own eyes or by being informed of that by two witnesses of good character, or of one according to the correct opinion. This was the view of al-Hafiz. (See: Fath al-Bari, commentary on hadith no. 1957; al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 6/267)

50024,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50024,Can I’tikaf Be Observed at Any Time?,Can i’tikaf be done at any time or is it only to be done in Ramadan?,"I’tikaf is Sunnah and can be observed at any time of the year but it is better to observe it in Ramadan, especially in the last ten days.",,"Praise be to Allah.I’tikaf is Sunnah at any time, in Ramadan or otherwise, but it is better in Ramadan, especially in the last ten days of Ramadan. 
This is indicated by the general meaning of the evidence which speaks of i'tikaf being mustahabb, which includes Ramadan and other times. 
Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmu’ (6/501): 
“I’tikaf is Sunnah according to consensus, and it is not obligatory unless one vowed to do it – also according to consensus. It is mustahabb to do it a great deal and it is mustahabb especially in the last ten days of Ramadan.” 
He also said (6/514): 
“The best i’tikaf is that which is accompanied by fasting, and the best of that is in Ramadan, and the best of that is the last ten days.” 
Al-Albani said in Qiyam Ramadan: 
“I'tikaf is Sunnah in Ramadan and at other times of the year. The basis for that is the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“…while you are in I‘tikaf (i.e. confining oneself in a mosque for prayers and invocations leaving the worldly activities) in the mosques.” [al-Baqarah 2:187]
And there are sahih ahadith which describe the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) observing i’tikaf as well as numerous reports which describe the salaf as doing so too. 
It was proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) observed i’tikaf during ten days of Shawwal as well. This is agreed upon. 
‘Umar said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “During the Jahiliyyah I vowed to observe i’tikaf for one night in al-Masjid al-Haram.” He said: “Fulfill your vow.” So he [‘Umar] observed itikaf for one night. Agreed upon. 
It is more emphasized in Ramadan, because of the hadith of Abu Hurayrah: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to observe i’tikaf for ten days every Ramadan, and in the year in which he passed away he observed i’tikaf for twenty days. Narrated by al-Bukhari. 
The best i’tikaf is at the end of Ramadan, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to observe i’tikaf for the last ten days of Ramadan until he passed away. Agreed upon.” 
Shaykh Ibn Baz said in Majmu’ al-Fatawa (15/437): 
“Undoubtedly i'tikaf in the mosque is an act of worship, and (observing it) in Ramadan is better than at other times. It is prescribed in Ramadan and at other times.”

“And do not have sexual relations with them (your wives) while you are in I‘tikaf (i.e. confining oneself in a mosque for prayers and invocations leaving the worldly activities) in the mosques.” [al-Baqarah 2:187]
So i'tikaf is something that should be done specifically in the mosque. (See al-Mughni, 4/461)
“With regard to women, the majority of scholars are of the view that as in the case of men, their i’tikaf is not valid unless it is observed in the mosque , because of the verse quoted above (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And do not have sexual relations with them (your wives) while you are in I‘tikaf (i.e. confining oneself in a mosque for prayers and invocations leaving the worldly activities) in the mosques.” [al-Baqarah 2:187]
The wives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked him for permission to observe i’tikaf in the mosque and he gave them permission, and they used to observe i’tikaf in the mosque after he died. 
If it were permissible for a woman to observe i’tikaf in her house , the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would have told them to do that, because it is better for a woman to remain concealed in her house than to go out to the mosque. 
Some of the scholars were of the view that it is valid for a woman to observe i’tikaf in the “mosque” of her house, which is the place that she allocates for prayer in her house. 
But the majority of scholars said that this is not allowed and said that the place where she prays in her house is not called a masjid (mosque) except by way of metaphor, and it is not really a mosque, so it does not come under the rulings on mosques, hence it is permissible for people who are junub and menstruating women to enter it. (See al-Mughni, 4/464)
Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmu’ (6/505): 
“It is not valid for men or women to observe i’tikaf anywhere but in the mosque; it is not valid in the mosque of a woman’s house or the mosque of a man’s house, which is a space that is set aside for prayer.” 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked in Majmu’ al-Fatawa (20/264) about where a woman who wants to observe i’tikaf should do so? 
He replied: 
“If a woman wants to observe i’tikaf, she should observe i’tikaf in the mosque so long as that does not involve anything that is forbidden according to shari’ah. If that does involve anything that is forbidden then she should not do i’tikaf.” 
In al-Mawsu’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (5/212) it says: 
“The scholars differed as to where women should observe i’tikaf. The majority are of the view that women are like men, and their i’tikaf is not valid unless observed in the mosque. Based on this it is not valid for a woman to observe i'tikaf in the mosque of her house, because of the report narrated from Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) who asked about a woman who vowed to observe i’tikaf in the mosque of her house. He said: “(This is) an innovation, and the most hateful of actions to Allah are innovations (bid’ah).” So there can be no i'tikaf except in a mosque in which prayers are established. And the mosque of a house is not a mosque in the real sense of the word and does not come under the same rulings; it is permissible to change it, and for a person who is junub to sleep in it. Moreover if it were permissible (to observe i’tikaf at home), the Prophet’s wives (may Allah be pleased with them) would have done that at least once to show that it is permissible.”",Islam Q&A

It was also narrated that he does not have to offer expiation or make up that fast. 
Ibn Khuzaymah (1999) narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever breaks his fast in Ramadan by mistake does not have to make up that day or offer expiation.” (Classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Khuzaymah.) 
Al-Daraqutni narrated from Abu Sa’id al-Khudri that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever eats in the month of Ramadan by mistake does not have to make up that day.” 
Al-Hafiz said: 
“Although its isnad (chain of transmission) is weak, it may still be considered sound because there are corroborating reports. The least that could be said about it is that it is hasan, so it may be quoted as evidence. Reports that are less strong than this have been quoted as evidence with regard to many issues. It may also be supported by the fact that a number of the Companions issued fatwas that are in agreement with this hadith without any one of the Companions having a different view, as was stated by Ibn al-Mundhir, Ibn Hazm and others, and ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib, Zayd ibn Thabit, Abu Hurayrah, and Ibn ‘Umar. And it is in accordance with the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“but He will call you to account for that which your hearts have earned.” [al-Baqarah 2:225]
Forgetfulness is not something which is earned by the heart. 
This hadith tells of the kindness of Allah to His slaves and how He makes things easier for them and alleviates hardship.” 
The majority of scholars quote these hadiths as evidence that whoever forgets that he is fasting and breaks the fast, his fast is still valid, and he should complete his fast, and he does not have to make it up or offer any expiation. The general meaning of the hadith covers both obligatory and nafl fasts; there is no difference between the two. 
Al-Shafi’i said in al-Umm (2/284): 
“If a fasting person eats or drinks in Ramadan or in a fast observed in fulfillment of a vow or as an expiation, or a fast that is obligatory for some reason, or a voluntary fast , out of forgetfulness, then his fast is complete and he does not have to make it up.”  
Al-Nawawi said: 
“This is evidence to support the view of the majority: if the fasting person eats or drinks or has intercourse because of forgetfulness, then he does not break his fast. Among those who were of this view are al-Shafi’i, Abu Hanifah, Dawud and others.” 
Al-Hafiz said: 
“An interesting story was narrated by ‘Abd al-Razzaq from ‘Amr ibn Dinar: that a person came to Abu Hurayrah and said: “I started fasting in the morning then I forgot and ate.” He said, “It does not matter.” He said: “Then I entered upon someone and by mistake I ate and drank.” He said, “It does not matter, Allah has fed you and given you to drink.” Then he said:  “I entered upon another person and forgot, and ate.” Abu Hurayrah said: “You are a person who is not used to fasting.”

    This hadeeth was narrated by al-Tirmidhi (807) from Zayd ibn 
    Khaalid al-Juhani who said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever gives iftaar to one who is 
    fasting will have a reward like his, without that detracting from the reward 
    of the one who fasted.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh 
    al-Tirmidhi. 
This hadeeth is general 
    in meaning and applies to all who fast, whether they are rich or poor. It 
    also includes relatives and others. 

    See Fayd al-Qadeer by al-Manaawi, commentary on 
    hadeeth no. 8890. 

    Indeed, giving iftaar to a fasting person who is a relative 
    may bring a greater reward, because by doing so you may earn the reward of 
    giving iftaar to one who is fasting and of upholding the ties of kinship, so 
    long as the one who is not a relative is not a poor person who cannot find 
    any food with which to break his fast, in which case giving him iftaar will 
    bring a greater reward because that will be meeting his needs. 

    By the same token, giving charity to a poor relative brings a 
    greater reward than giving charity to a poor person who is not a relative. 

    Al-Tirmidhi (658) and Ibn Maajah (1844) narrated that Salmaan 
    ibn ‘Aamir al-Dabiy said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) said: “Charity given to a poor person is charity, but 
    charity given to a relative is two things: charity and upholding the ties of 
    kinship.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah. 

    Al-Haafiz said in Fath al-Baari: 
It is not necessarily 
    the case that a gift given to a relative is better in all situations, 
    because there is the possibility that a poor person may be in desperate need 
    and the other person (the relative) may not need it at all.  

    Conclusion: 

    Giving iftaar to a relative comes under the meaning of the 
    words of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), 
    “Whoever gives iftaar to one who is fasting will have a reward like his,” 
    and giving him iftaar may bring a greater reward than giving iftaar to one 
    who is not a relative, or it may be the opposite, depending of the needs of 
    those concerned and the interests served by giving him iftaar.

In the last few years he has become unable to control his urine. We change his clothes more than once each day. Does he have to pray even though he cannot remain pure? Should we make him fast?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The ruling concerning your father differs depending on his 
    state of mind. If he loses his reason and his memory then he should not be 
    told to purify himself or to pray or fast, but when his mind is present and 
    focused and his memory is with him, then he should be told to do the duties 
    enjoined by sharee’ah as best as he can, without causing himself undue 
    hardship. 

    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have 
    mercy on him) was asked: 

    Do those who have lost their memory, the feeble-minded, young 
    children and the insane have to fast? 

    He replied: 

    Allaah has enjoined acts of worship on man if he is able to 
    bear that obligation, by being of sound mind and able to understand things. 
    But if he is not of sound mind then he does not have to do those acts of 
    worship. So the insane and young children who have no powers of discernment 
    do not have to do these acts of worship. This is by the mercy of Allaah, may 
    He be glorified and exalted. The same applies to the feeble-minded person 
    whose mind is affected in some way but not to the degree of insanity and the 
    elderly person who has lost his memory, as this questioner says, do not have 
    to fast, pray or purify themselves, because the one who has lost his memory 
    is like a small child who has no power of discernment, so the duties of 
    Islam are waived for him and he does not have to purify himself or pray, nor 
    does he have to fast. With regard to the financial obligations, they are 
    required of his wealth even in this case, so zakaah – for example – must be 
    paid by his guardian on his wealth if it reaches the amount at which zakaah 
    becomes due, because the obligation of zakaah is connected to wealth, as 
    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Take Sadaqah (alms) from their wealth in order to purify 
    them and sanctify them with it, and invoke Allaah for them. Verily, your 
    invocations are a source of security for them; and Allaah is All-Hearer, 
    All-Knower”

    [al-Tawbah 9:103]

    He did not say “take it from them.” 

    And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said to Mu’aadh (may Allaah be pleased with him) when he sent him to 
    Yemen: “Teach them that Allaah has enjoined on them sadaqah (charity) from 
    their wealth, to be taken from their rich and given to their poor.” He said, 
    “Charity from their wealth” and explained that it is to be taken from their 
    wealth, even though it is to be taken from the owner of the wealth.  
Whatever the case, the 
    financial obligations are not waived for a person in this case, but the 
    religious obligations such as prayer, purification and fasting, are waived 
    in the case of people like this man, because he does not have any powers of 
    understanding.

    He replied: 

    The ruling changes according to the reason. At times when he

    incoherent, he does not have to fast. If we assume that he is insane one day

This brownish discharge that came after doing ghusl does not matter and is not regarded as menstruation. So your fast is still valid and you do not have to do ghusl after it comes out. This is because Umm ‘Atiyyah said: “We did not regard brownish or yellowish discharge after the period ended as being anything that mattered.” (Narrated by Abu Dawood, 307; classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. Also narrated by al-Bukhari with the words: “We did not regard brownish and yellowish discharge as anything that mattered.”)

If it came out after you did wudu and you did not repeat wudu, then you have to repeat that prayer because you prayed without wudu. 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz was asked in Majmoo’ al-Fatawa (10/214): 
I noticed that when doing ghusl following my monthly period, which usually lasts for five days, sometimes a very small amount comes out of me, immediately after doing ghusl. Then after that nothing comes out. I do not know whether I should assume that my regular period is five days and whatever comes after that does not count, and I should fast and pray and I don’t have to do anything else because of that, or I should regard that day as part of my period and not pray and fast then? Please note that this does not always happen, rather it is approximately every two or three cycles. 
He replied: 
If what comes out of you after you have purified yourself is yellowish or brownish, then it should not be regarded as anything that matters, rather it comes under the same ruling as urine. But if it is obviously blood, then it should be regarded as part of the period, so you have to repeat your ghusl, because of the report from Umm ‘Atiyyah (may Allah be pleased with her), who was one of the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). She said: “We used not to regard yellowish or brownish discharge after purification as being anything that mattered.” 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked in Fataawa al-Siyaam (p. 105): A woman says that her period came, then the bleeding stopped on the sixth day from Maghrib until twelve midnight, so she did ghusl on that day and fasted the following day. Then some brownish discharge came but she fasted that day. Is that to be regarded as part of her period even though her usual period is seven days? 
He replied: 
This brownish discharge is not part of the period. The brownish discharge that women get after the end of the period is not anything that matters. Umm 'Atiyyah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “We used not to regard yellowish or brownish discharge after purification as being anything that mattered.” 
According to another report: “We used not to regard it as anything that mattered” – and she did not say after purification. Menstruation is blood, not brownish or yellowish discharge. 
Based on this, then this woman’s fast was valid, whether that was on the day when she did not see any brownish discharge or on the day when she did see some brownish discharge, because this brownish discharge is not menstruation. 
The Standing Committee (10/158) was asked about a woman who became pure (i.e., her period ended) in Ramadan before dawn came, so she fasted that day, then she went to pray at Zuhr and saw some yellowish discharge. Is her fast valid? 
They replied: 
If she had become pure before dawn then fasted, her fast is valid and the yellowish discharge she noticed after becoming pure does not affect it, because Umm ‘Atiyyah said: “We used not to regard yellowish or brownish discharge after purification as being anything that mattered.”

50063,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50063,Does tabarruj invalidate the fast?,Does tabarruj invalidate the fast?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
Allah has prescribed fasting for great reasons. One of the most important of these reasons and one of the greatest purposes achieved by the fast is so that we may attain piety (taqwa), as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning) : 
“O you who believe! Observing As-Sawm (the fasting) is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, that you may become Al-Muttaqoon (the pious)” [al-Baqarah 2:183]
Taqwa or piety means obeying that which Allah has commanded and avoiding that which He has forbidden. 
The person who is fasting is commanded to do acts of worship and obedience, and he is forbidden to do haraam things. Sins are bad enough when committed by anyone, but they are even worse when committed by one who is fasting. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does not give up false speech and acting in accordance with it, and ignorant conduct, Allah has no need of him giving up his food and drink.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 6057. See also question no. 37989 and 37658. 
Ibn Khuzaymah, Ibn Hibaan and al-Haakim narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Fasting does not just mean giving up food and drink, rather fasting also means giving up idle and obscene talk.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Targheeb wa’l-Tarheeb, 1082. 
‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab and ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with them) said: Fasting does not just mean giving up food and drink; it also means giving up lies, falsehood and idle talk. 
Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah said: If you fast, then block your ears, eyes and tongue from lies and sin; do not abuse your servants; be tranquil and dignified on the day of your fast; do not let the day when you do not fast and the day when you fast be the same. 
It was narrated that Taleeq ibn Qays said: Abu Dharr said: When you fast then be careful as much as you can. When Taleeq was fasting he would enter his house and only come out to pray. 
When Abu Hurayrah and his companions (may Allah be pleased with them) fasted, they would stay in the mosque and say, “We are keeping our fast pure.”  See al-Muhalla, 4/305 
One of the scholars said: 
The person who is fasting must fast with his eyes and not look at anything that is not permissible; with his ears and not listen to anything that is not permissible; with his tongue and not speak any obscene words or slander any one or tell lies or backbite. 
The believer should make the most of this blessed month in which the devils are chained up, the gates of Paradise are opened and the gates of Hell are closed, and a caller cries out, “O seeker of good, go ahead; O seeker of evil, desist!” The believer should make the most of this month so that he may draw closer to Allah, repent sincerely from all his sins and make a pledge to Allah to adhere to His religion and laws. 
Secondly: 
Sin – including a woman’s making a wanton display (tabarruj) of her beauty and charms to non-mahram men – detracts from the reward of fasting. The more sins are committed and the more serious they are, the more that detracts from the reward of fasting, and it may cancel out the reward altogether, so that a person may have denied himself food, drink and all the things that break the fast, yet still deprived himself of the reward for that by disobeying Allah. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The one who fasts may get nothing from his fast but hunger, and the one who prays qiyaam may get nothing from his qiyaam but a sleepless night.” Narrated by Ibn Maajah, 1690; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah. 
Al-Subki said in his Fataawa, 1/221-226: 
Can the (reward for) fasting be decreased by sins that may occur while one is fasting, or not? The view which we favour is that it can decrease, and I do not think there is any differing opinion on this matter… 
Note that the complete reward for fasting is achieved when it is accompanied by acts of worship such as reading Qur’aan, observing i’tikaaf, praying, giving charity etc, and it may be achieved by avoiding haraam things. All of these things make the reward more complete.  
Thirdly: 
With regard to fasting that is accompanied by sins – including tabarruj on the part of a woman – the fast is not invalidated by that, rather it is valid and the fasting person has fulfilled his obligation and does not have to make up the fast. But the reward for fasting is decreased by that sin and it may be cancelled out altogether as stated above. 
Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmoo’ (6/398): 
The fasting person should protect his fast from backbiting and slander. What this means is that it is more important for the fasting person to avoid these sins than others, although those who are not fasting should avoid these sins too, as that is enjoined in all situations. If a person backbites while fasting, he has committed a sin but that does not invalidate his fast in our view. This is the view of Maalik, Abu Haneefah, Ahmad and all the scholars except al-Awzaa’i who said that the fast is invalidated by backbiting, and must be made up. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was asked in Fataawa al-Siyaam (p. 358): If a person utters some haraam words during the day in Ramadaan does that invalidate his fast? 
He replied: 
If we read the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Observing As-Sawm (the fasting) is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, that you may become Al-Muttaqoon (the pious)” [al-Baqarah 2:183]
we will see that the reason why fasting is enjoined is so that we may attain piety, and piety means avoiding things that are forbidden. In general it means doing that which is commanded and avoiding that which is forbidden. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does not give up false speech and acting in accordance with it, and ignorant conduct, Allah has no need of him giving up his food and drink.” 
Based on this, the fasting person has to avoid haraam words and actions, so he should not backbite about people, or tell lies, or spread malicious gossip amongst them, he should not engage in haraam transactions, and he should avoid all haraam things. If a person avoids that for a whole month then he should be able to adhere to that straight path for the rest of the year. But unfortunately many of those who fast do not differentiate between the days when they fast and the days when they do not fast, so they carry on as usual with haraam speech such as lying, cheating and so on. You do not feel that they are observing the dignity of fasting. These actions do not invalidate the fast but they do detract from its reward, and may cancel out the reward of fasting altogether.",Islam Q&A

Qiyam Al-Layl plays a great role in strengthening one's faith and helping one to do good deeds. Allah praises those who have faith and are pious for their noble characteristics and good deeds, one of the most special of which is Qiyam Al-Layl. It is one of the means of avoiding the punishment of Hell and attaining Paradise. The Prophet said: “The best prayer after the obligatory prayer is prayer at night.”",,"Praise be to Allah.Qiyam Al-Layl is a confirmed Sunnah. Many texts of the Quran and Sunnah encourage it and speak of its high status and great reward. 
Qiyam Al-Layl plays a great role in strengthening one's faith and helping one to do good deeds. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you wrapped in garments (i.e. Prophet Muhammad)! Stand (to pray) all night, except a little — Half of it or a little less than that, Or a little more. And recite the Quran (aloud) in a slow, (pleasant tone and) style. Verily, We shall send down to you a weighty Word (i.e. obligations, laws). Verily, the rising by night (for Tahajjud prayer ) is very hard and most potent and good for governing oneself, and most suitable for (understanding) the Word (of Allah).” [Al-Muzzamil 73:1-6]
Allah praises those who have faith and are pious for their noble characteristics and good deeds, one of the most special of which is Qiyam Al-Layl. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Only those believe in Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), who, when they are reminded of them, fall down prostrate, and glorify the Praises of their Lord, and they are not proud. Their sides forsake their beds, to invoke their Lord in fear and hope, and they spend (in charity in Allah’s Cause) out of what We have bestowed on them. No person knows what is kept hidden for them of joy as a reward for what they used to do.” [As-Sajdah 32:15-17]
Allah describes them elsewhere in the following terms (interpretation of the meaning):
“And those who spend the night in worship of their Lord, prostrating and standing. And those who say: “Our Lord! Avert from us the torment of Hell. Verily, its torment is ever an inseparable, permanent punishment.” Evil indeed it (Hell) is as an abode and as a place to rest in. And those who, when they spend, are neither extravagant nor niggardly, but hold a medium (way) between those (extremes). And those who do not invoke any other god along with Allah, nor kill the soul which Allah has forbidden [to be killed], except by right, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse and whoever does this shall receive the punishment.  The torment will be doubled to him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace; Except those who repent and believe (in Islamic Monotheism), and do righteous deeds; for those, Allah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. And whosoever repents and does righteous good deeds; then verily, he repents towards Allah with true repentance. And those who do not bear witness to falsehood, and if they pass by some evil play or evil talk, they pass by it with dignity. And those who, when they are reminded of the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of their Lord, fall not deaf and blind thereat. And those who say: “Our Lord! Bestow on us from our wives and our offspring the comfort of our eyes, and make us leaders of the Muttaqun (the pious).” Those will be rewarded with the highest place (in Paradise) because of their patience. Therein they shall be met with greetings and the word of peace and respect. Abiding therein excellent it is as an abode, and as a place to rest in.” [Al-Furqan 25:64-76]
From this we may note the virtue of Qiyam Al-Layl and its good consequences that cannot be ignored; it is one of the means of avoiding the punishment of Hell and attaining Paradise, and we may note the great blessing it brings of conversing with the Lord. May Allah make us among those who attain success thereby. 
Allah has described the pious in Surah Adh-Dhariyat as having a number of characteristics – including praying Qiyam Al-Layl – by means of which they attain Paradise. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, the pious will be in the midst of Gardens and Springs (in the Paradise), Taking joy in the things which their Lord has given them. Verily, they were before this, good-doers. They used to sleep but little by night [invoking their Lord (Allah) and praying, with fear and hope]” [Adh-Dhariyat 51:15-17]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) encouraged us to pray Qiyam Al-Layl in many Hadiths, such as the following: 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The best prayer after the obligatory prayer is prayer at night.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1163) 
He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) also said: “You should pray Qiyam Al-Layl , for it is the custom of the righteous who came before you and it brings you closer to your Lord, and expiates sins and prevents misdeeds.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 3549; classed as sound by Al-Albani in Irwa’ Al-Ghalil, 452) 
“The custom of the righteous” means it was their usual practise. 
“It brings you closer to your Lord” means, it is an act of worship by means of which one may draw closer to Allah. 
“and prevents misdeeds” means, it prevents one from committing sin. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, the prayer prevents from great sins (of every kind, and from unlawful sexual intercourse) and Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism, and every kind of evil wicked deed).” [Al-`Ankabut 29:45]
`Amr ibn Murrah Al-Juhani (may Allah be pleased with him) said: A man came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) from Qada’ah and said to him: “O Messenger of Allah, what do you think if I bear witness that there is none is worthy of worship except Allah and that you are His Messenger, and I pray the five daily prayers, and fast the month (of Ramadan), and pray Qiyam in Ramadan, and pay Zakah?”  The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever dies doing that will be one of the Siddiqs and martyrs.” (Narrated by Ibn Khuzaymah; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Khuzaymah, 2212)
At-Tirmidhi (1984) narrated that `Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “In Paradise there are apartments the outside of which can be seen from the inside and the inside of which can be seen from the outside.” A Bedouin stood up and said: “Who are they for, O Messenger of Allah?” He said: “They are for those who speak good words, feed others, fast regularly and pray to Allah at night when people are sleeping.” (Classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi) 
Al-Hakim (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Jibril came to me and said: `O Muhammad, live as long as you want, for you will die. Love whomever you want, for you will leave him. Do whatever you want for you will be requited for it. Remember that the believer’s honour is his praying at night, and his pride is his being independent of people.” (Classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih Al-Jami`, 73)  
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever prays Qiyam reciting ten verses will not be recorded as one of the negligent. Whoever prays Qiyam reciting one hundred verses will be recorded as one of the devout. Whoever prays Qiyam reciting one thousand verses will be recorded as one of the Muqantirin.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 1398; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud) 
The Muqantirin are those who will be given a Qintar of reward. A Qintar is a large amount of gold, and most of the scholars of Arabic language are of the view that it is four thousand Dinars. 
It was also said that a Qintar is a bull’s hide full of gold, or eighty thousand, or a large but unspecified amount of wealth. (See Al-Nihayah fi Gharib il-Hadith by Ibn Al-Athir)
What is meant by this Hadith is to emphasize the greatness of the reward earned by the one who recites a thousand verses. At-Tabarani narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “A Qintar is better than this world and everything in it.” (Classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Targhib, 638) 
Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: From Surah Tabarak [Al-Mulk] to the end of the Quran is one thousand verses. 
Whoever prays Qiyam reciting from Surah Tabarak to the end of Quran has prayed Qiyam with one thousand verses.

50074,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50074,Is It Prohibited to Sell Christmas Items?,"There is a factory that makes glass gifts, such as perfume bottles and candlesticks and exports them to other countries. I have been offered a position with responsibility for exports, but the factory will ask me to make some gifts that are just for Christian holidays (Christmas) such as crosses and images.
 Is this work permissible? I fear Allah now that I have been blessed with some knowledge and have memorized His Book.","It is not permissible for any Muslim to join in the festivals of the non-Muslims, whether by attending the festivities or enabling them to hold their celebrations, or selling any goods or products that have to do with these festivals.",,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for any Muslim to join in the festivals of the non-Muslims , whether by attending the festivities or enabling them to hold their celebrations, or selling any goods or products that have to do with these festivals. 
Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim (may Allah have mercy on him) wrote to the Minister for Trade, saying: 
“From Muhammad ibn Ibrahim to His Excellency the Minister for Trade, may Allah preserve him. Peace be upon you and the mercy of Allah and His blessings. 
We have been told that last year, some traders imported gifts for Christmas and the Christian New Year, including Christmas trees , and that some citizens bought these and gave them as gifts to Christian foreigners in our country, joining them in this festival. 
This is an evil action which they should not have done. Undoubtedly you know that this is not permissible, and you are aware of what the scholars have said about there being scholarly consensus on the prohibition on joining the non-Muslim, disbelievers and people of the Book in their festivals. 
We hope that you will issue a ban on these gifts that have been brought into our country and other things that come under the same ruling and are things that are unique to their celebrations.” (Fatawa Al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim, 3/105) 
Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: 
Some Muslims join the Christians in their celebrations. What is your advice? 
He replied: 
“It is not permissible for any Muslim man or woman to join the Christians, Jews or other non-Muslims in their festivals , rather that must be avoided, because “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) warned us against imitating them and adopting their ways. So the believer, man or woman, must beware of that; it is not permissible to help them in doing that in any way, because these festivals are against Shari`ah, so it is prohibited to take part in them or to cooperate with the people who are celebrating it, or help them in any way, whether by helping them to serve tea or coffee or in other ways such as providing vessels etc, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Help you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allah. Verily, Allah is Severe in punishment.” [Al-Ma’idah 5:2] 
Joining in with the non-Muslim on their holidays is a kind of cooperating in sin and transgression.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 6/405) 
In a statement issued by the scholars of the Standing Committee concerning joining in celebrations of the Millennium, they said: 
“… It is not permissible for a Muslim to cooperate with the non-Muslim in any way with regard to their festivals, such as announcing and publicizing their festivals , including the Millennium mentioned above, or promoting them by any means, whether that is via the media or by setting up a clock to “count down” to the Millennium, or making clothes or other items that commemorate the occasion, or printing greeting cards or stationery marking this occasion, or offering special discounts or prizes on these occasions, or holding sporting events or producing special logos for them etc. 
Based on this, it is not permissible for you to participate in making anything that has to do with the festivals of the non-Muslim; you should leave this job for the sake of Allah, and Allah will compensate you with something better than it in sha Allah.”

50075,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50075,Ruling on prayer in congregation for one who is sick and one who cannot control najaasah (impurity),"I have a colleague who had an operation to remove the opening of the anus and create an opening in his side because of a tumour.
 My question is: with the new opening he cannot control what comes out or the smell. Is it permissible for him to pray in the mosque or should he pray at home?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
We ask Allah to heal him and make him well, and we ask Him to bless him with patience and reward him for the trials he is going through. 
With this sickness, the patient cannot control emission of stools, rather the stools come out continually through the opening that has been created in his side. So the ruling in this case is the same as the ruling on continual incontinence. 
Based on this, it is permissible for a person who has this problem to combine two prayers if it is difficult for him to offer each prayer at its proper time. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:  
The correct view is that joining prayers is not something that is only for lengthy journeys, rather prayers may be joined because of rain or because of sickness, as is narrated in the Sunnah concerning a woman who was suffering from istihaadah (irregular non-menstrual vaginal bleeding), and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told her to combine two prayers, as was mentioned in two hadeeths.(Al-Fatawa al-Kubra, 1/49)
The scholars of the Standing Committee said concerning the ruling on a woman who cannot control her urine because of some sickness that she is suffering from: 
If the matter is as described, then she should pray according to her situation, and there is no reason why she should not combine Zuhr and ‘Asr at the time of one of them, and Maghrib and ‘Isha’, because of the general meaning of the evidence that indicates that Islam seeks to make things easy. This is subject to the condition that her wudoo’ for Zuhr and ‘Asr be done after the time for them begins, and likewise that her wudoo’ for Maghrib and ‘Isha’ be done after the time for them begins. 
Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah li’l-Buhooth al-‘Ilmiyyah wa’l-Ifta, 8/85 
Secondly: 
The obligation to pray in congregation in the mosque is not waived in such cases, unless by going there the patient is likely to contaminate the mosque or there will be an offensive smell from the new opening, because that will bother the other worshippers. 
With regard to the unpleasant smell, if there is such a smell emanating from a person, this excuses him from having to attend prayers in congregation, indeed it is not permissible for him to come to the mosque and annoy the angels and worshippers with this smell. 
Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen said: 
If there is an offensive smell coming from his mouth, nose or elsewhere that offends the worshippers, then he should not attend, so as to ward off that annoyance. 
Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 4/323 
The one who has eaten onions and garlic is forbidden to attend congregational prayer in the mosque, because these two vegetables have unpleasant smells. We may add to that the foul smell of tobacco and cigarettes, which are haraam. 
Muslim (564) narrated from Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever has eaten onions, garlic or leeks, let him not come near our mosque, for the angels are offended by that which offends the sons of Adam.” 
If it was this patient’s habit to pray in congregation in the mosque, then the reward for that will be recorded for him even if he prays in his house. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: 
The person who is excused will have the reward of praying in congregation recorded for him in full, if it was his habit to pray in congregation, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If a person falls sick or travels, the reward for what he used to do when he was healthy and not travelling will be recorded for him.” 
Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 4/323 
With regard to contaminating the mosque with impure things, this is haraam. We have been commanded to clean and perfume the mosques. 
Al-Bukhaari (221) and Muslim (284) narrated that Anas ibn Maalik said: A Bedouin came and urinated in a corner of the mosque and the people rebuked him. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told them not to do that. When he had finished urinating, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) called for a bucket of water and poured it over it. 
According to a version narrated by Muslim (285): Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) called him and said to him: These mosques are not places for urinating or any other filthy thing, rather they are for the remembrance of Allah, may He be glorified, prayer and reading Qur’aan.” 
Al-Nawawi said in Sharh Saheeh Muslim: 
It is haraam to bring najaasah (impurities) into the mosque. If a person on whose body is something impure fears that it may contaminate the mosque, it is not permissible for him to enter. If there is no such danger then it is permissible (for him to enter).",Islam Q&A
