For example Abu Dawood (3535) narrated that ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) took a piece of silk in his right hand and  a piece of gold in his left and said, ‘These two are forbidden for the males of my ummah.’” Classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 3422.
 What is meant by the silk that is forbidden to men is natural silk that is taken from the silkworm. As for artificial silk, that is not included in the prohibition, because there is no statement that it is haraam in either the Quran or Sunnah. If it is not narrated in the Quran and Sunnah that a thing is forbidden, then it is permissible, because the basic principle concerning things is that they are permitted.
 But some of these fabrics made from artificial silk may be very soft and like the fabric worn by women. These should be avoided by men, because what is required of men is to be tough and hard; softness is not appropriate for men.

30842,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/30842,Saving system in Aramco and attitude towards the various fatwas concerning it,"We are a group of Saudi Aramco employees, and we are worried, like any other Muslim, about the legitimacy of the wealth we acquire. Recently we have become very confused, to an extent which only Allaah knows. Perhaps you know something about the savings system in Saudi Aramco. (The company is encouraging me to save with them by giving me a bonus when I am laid off or when I leave the company.
The bonus is a percentage of my contribution based on how long I have been with the company, for example: 
If my total contribution is 100,000 riyals, and I have been with the company for 10 years, my remuneration from the company will be 100,000 riyals. 
If the length of time I have been with the company is 7 years, then my remuneration will be only 70% of 100,000, which is 70,000 riyals). 
What we knew previously was that this system is haraam according to sharee’ah, based on the ruling of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas, but now we have heard a fatwa from Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Munayyi’ (may Allaah preserve him), stating that this savings scheme is permissible. This has made us confused, and we do not know whether to follow the Committee or Shaykh al-Munayyi’, because he is specialized in the field of economics.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly:
The savings scheme used in the Aramco company is a haraam system. It is blatant riba (usury, interest) because it is a loan that brings a benefit. If a person pays in 100,000 riyals, to take it back after a period of ten years, or seven, or whatever, with an added payment of 100,000 riyals, or 70,000, or even one riyal, then he has engaged in blatant riba, which is haraam according to scholarly consensus.
 Imam Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “Every loan which is given subject to the condition than an increased amount be paid back is haraam, with no difference of opinion (among the scholars). Ibn al-Mundhir said: There is consensus that if the lender stipulates that the borrower must pay extra or give him a gift, and the money is lent on that basis, then his taking the extra amount is riba. It was narrated that Ubayy ibn Ka’b, Ibn ‘Abbaas and Ibn Mas’ood forbade loans that bring benefit. 
Al-Mughni, 6/436. 
It does not matter that the company calls this transaction a savings plan or investment scheme or mudaarabah (silent partnership), because every investment that guarantees one’s capital is a loan, even if people call it something else. What counts is what a thing actually is, not what it is called. 
With regard to the kinds of investments or savings that are acceptable in Islam, they are based on certain conditions, the most important of which are as follows: 
1 – The money should come from you, and the labour or work should come from the other party; there is nothing wrong with the other party putting in money as well as work. 
2 – The area of investment should be clearly defined, since most of these companies invest the money by putting it in riba-based banks, or in projects that are not permissible. 
3 – Both parties should agree on the percentage of profits allocated to each, which should not come from the capital, so you get 50% or 10% of the profits, for example.
 4 – The person who is doing business on your behalf should not guarantee your capital. In the event of loss – so long as it is not caused by negligence – you will lose your capital and he will lose his labour. 
If the capital is guaranteed, then this transaction is a loan which must be paid off with no extra amount added. If an extra amount is stipulated, then this is riba.
We ask Allaah to keep us safe from riba and its evil and dangers, and to make us independent by means of that which He has permitted so that we will feel no need of that which He has forbidden. 
The point is that the Aramco savings scheme is haraam, because it guarantees the capital and because the profit is a set percentage of the capital. So it is a loan with interest, as well as the fact that the investor does not know where his money will be invested. 
The Standing Committee pointed out that the claim that what is given to the employee is a reward or bonus from the company is false, because it is only given to those who save with this plan. If it was really a reward or bonus it would be given to all employees. 
As the questioner mentioned, the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas – under the leadership of Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him), with whom were Shaykh ‘Abd al-Razzaaq ‘Afeefi, Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Ghadyaan and Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Qa’ood, who are all leading scholars – was asked about the savings plan in the Aramco company. They replied as follows: “Participating in the Aramco savings plan is haraam, because it involves two types of riba (riba al-fadl and riba al-nasa’); it defines the rate of interest, which may be anything between five and one hundred percent of the money that is saved by the Saudi employee, in addition to the rewards that are given to the employee, to the exclusion of other employees who do not invest, as is stated in the savings plan. 
Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 13/510-515 
Similarly Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen and other scholars also issued fatwas stating that the Aramco savings plan is haraam. 
Secondly: 
If the scholars differ with regard to a shar’i ruling, the person who is seeking the fatwa should try to find out which is correct by examining the evidence quoted by both parties and following that which he thinks is more correct. This applies if the person seeking the fatwa is a seeker of knowledge (taalib ‘ilm) who is able to determine which is more correct. 
If he is not able to determine which is more correct, because he has no specialized knowledge of sharee’ah, then he must follow the view of the one whom he thinks is more knowledgeable and more trustworthy; he does not have the right to choose whichever opinion he wants. 
With regard to the issue at hand, the major scholars have clearly stated that it is haraam, and they are more knowledgeable and more trustworthy than those who gave a different opinion – which is not intended to belittle the other party – so you have to avoid this savings plan, for the reasons stated above. 
Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked what the Muslim’s attitude towards scholarly differences should be, He replied: “If the Muslim has enough knowledge to enable him to compare the scholarly opinions and their evidence, and to decide which is more correct, then he must do that, because Allaah has commanded us to refer disputed matters to the Qur’aan and Sunnah, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
‘(And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allaah and His Messenger, if you believe in Allaah and in the Last Day’
[al-Nisa’ 4:59]
So he should refer the disputed matter to the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and whatever seems to him to be more correct based on the evidence, he should follow it, because what is necessary is to follow the evidence and the opinions of the scholars may be used to help one understand the evidence. 
But if the Muslim does not have enough knowledge to be able to decide which scholarly view is more correct, then he must ask the scholars whose knowledge and religious commitment he trusts, and follow the fatwas that they issue to him. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So ask the people of the Reminder if you do not know”
[al-Anbiya’ 21:43]
The scholars have stated that the madhhab of the ordinary Muslim is the madhhab of his mufti (the scholar whom he asks for a fatwa). 
If the scholars’ opinions vary, then he must follow the one who is most trustworthy and most knowledgeable. This is like when a person falls sick and he looks for the most trustworthy and knowledgeable doctor because he is more likely than others to get it right. It is more important to be on the safe side in matters of religion than in worldly matters. 
It is not permissible for a Muslim to select the scholarly opinion that is in accordance with his own whims and desires, if that goes against the evidence, or to seek rulings from those whom he thinks will be lenient in issuing fatwas. 
Rather he must try to be on the safe side with regard to his religion, and ask scholars who are more knowledgeable and who fear Allaah more. 
From Ikhtilaaf al-‘Ulama’ Asbaabuhu wa Mawqifuna minhu, p. 23. See also question no. 22652. 
The Muslim must beware of seeking fatwas from those who are known to be too lenient and to go against trustworthy scholars who are more knowledgeable. The Muslim should beware of following his whims and desires and only following those fatwas which are in accordance with his own wishes and desires, for the Muslim is required to go against the desires and whims of his own self. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“But as for him who feared standing before his Lord, and restrained himself from impure evil desires and lusts.
Verily, Paradise will be his abode”

But a promise may be broken in situations where the believer is excused such as forgetting, being forced or a promise to do something haram or not to do something obligatory.","Virtues of keeping promises in Islam


Breaking promises


Exceptions for breaking promises","Praise be to Allah.Virtues of keeping promises in Islam
Undoubtedly keeping promises and keeping one’s word are attributes of the believers. And breaking promises is one of the attributes of the hypocrites.   `Abdullah ibn ‘Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There are four (characteristics), whoever has them is a hypocrite, and whoever has one of the four has a characteristic of hypocrisy unless he gives it up: when he speaks, he lies; when he makes a promise he breaks it; when he makes a pledge he betrays it; and when he disputes he resorts to foul language.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2327; Muslim, 58) 
Breaking promises
The believer who makes promises to people and breaks his promise may have an excuse or he may not. If he has an excuse, then there is no sin on him, but if he does not have an excuse then he is a sinner. 
Exceptions for breaking promises 
There is no text – as far as we know – that makes any exception regarding the prohibition of breaking promises , but it may be that promises are broken in situations where the believer is excused. For example: 

Forgetting 

Allah has forgiven us for forgetfulness whereby obligatory actions are omitted or haram actions are committed. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error” [al-Baqarah 2:286]
And Allah has said: “Yes.” – Narrated by Muslim, 125, from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah. According to another version, He said: “I will do that.” (Narrated by Muslim, 126, from the hadith of Ibn ‘Abbas) 
Whoever makes a promise to someone then forgets the promise or forgets to do it at the time stated, there is no sin on him. 

Being forced to break one’s promise . 

Being forced is one of the impediments that make it permissible for a Muslim to break his promise, such as one who is detained or is prevented from fulfilling his promise, or who is threatened with a painful punishment. 
Ibn `Abbas narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has forgiven my ummah for their mistakes, what they forget and what they are forced to do.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah, 2045, and this hadith has many corroborating reports; classed as sahih by Shaykh al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami’, 1836)

A promise to do something haram or not to do something obligatory. 

Whoever promises someone that he will do something haram for him, or that he will not do something that is obligatory, it is not permissible for him to fulfill that promise. 
This may be supported by the hadith of `Aishah – which is also known as the hadith of Barirah – which is narrated in al-Sahihayn. `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) had promised Barirah’s former masters that the wala of Barirah [the right to inherit from her when she died – which is the right of the one who sets a slave free – Translator] would belong to them even though `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) was the one who was going to set Barirah free. But she did not keep this promise because they had gone against the Shari`ah and they knew that the right of wala belonged to the one who set the slave free, so how could `Aishah set her free and then the wala of Barirah belong to them? 
Al-Shafi`i said: 
“When news of that reached them, the one who had stipulated a condition that was contrary to the ruling of Allah and His Messenger was a sinner, and there are hudud punishments and discipline for the sinner. One of the ways in which the sinners are disciplined is that their conditions are rendered null and void so as to deter them and others from doing likewise. This is one of the best forms of discipline.” (Ikhtilaf al-Hadith, p. 165) 

If something unforeseen happens to the one who made the promise, such as sickness, the death of a relative or breakdown of his means of transportation, etc. 

There are many excuses, which all come under the heading of the verse (interpretation of the meaning):

30864,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/30864,Different kinds of humility,"I suffer from an inclination to be arrogant towards people and to feel superior towards them, and I would like to be humble. I hope that you can tell me something about the virtues of humility and its various types so that Allah may open my heart towards it.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Humility is one of the greatest blessings that Allah can bestow upon His slave. He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And by the Mercy of Allah, you dealt with them gently. And had you been severe and harsh-hearted, they would have broken away from about you” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:159] 
“And verily, you (O Muhammad) are on an exalted (standard of) character” [al-Qalam 68:4]
This refers to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) being a true slave of Allah in many ways and his treating all people with the utmost kindness. His character was one of complete humility based on sincerity towards Allah and compassion towards the slaves of Allah, which was the complete opposite of the characteristics of the proud and arrogant. 
Al-Majmoo’ al-Kaamilah li Mu’allafaat al-Shaykh al-Sa’di, 5/442, 443 
There are many means of attaining humility, which no Muslim adopts but he will attain this characteristic. They were explained by Imam Ibn al-Qayyim as follows: 
Humility comes from knowing about Allah and His names and attributes, and His greatness, venerating Him, loving Him and being in awe of Him; and also from knowing about oneself and one’s faults, and weaknesses. From that may develop the attitude of humility, which means feeling helpless before Allah, and being humble and compassionate towards His slaves, so that the person does not feel superior towards anyone, or think that he has any rights over anyone else; rather he thinks that others are better than him, and that their rights come before his. This is a characteristic that Allah gives to those whom He loves, honours and draws close to Him.(Al-Rooh, p. 233)
There are many reports which speak of the reward of humility. For example: 
It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Wealth does not decrease because of charity, and Allah increases His slave in honour when he forgives others. And no one humbles himself before Allah but Allah will raise him (in status).” 
Narrated by Muslim, 2588. Al-Nawawi included it in a chapter entitled: “The recommendation of forgiveness and humility.” 
Al-Nawawi said:  
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “And no one humbles himself before Allah but Allah will raise him (in status).” This is understood in two ways: the first is that He will raise him (in status) in this world, and give him status in people’s hearts because of his humility, and give him a high status in people’s eyes. The second is that what is meant is his reward in the Hereafter, where his status will be raised because of his humility in this world.  
The scholars said: It may be that both are meant, (and that his status will be raised) both in this world and in the Hereafter. And Allah knows best.""(Sharh Muslim, 16/142)
Humility may mean various things, such as: 
1.A person humbling himself to the commands and prohibitions of Allah, doing what He commands and avoiding what He forbids.
Ibn al-Qayyim said: 
Because a person may hesitate to obey His commands out of laziness, thus behaving in a reluctant way in an attempt to flee from servitude towards Allah, and his soul may have the desire to commit haraam actions, but when  the person humbles himself to the commands and prohibitions of Allah, he will humble himself to true submission (‘uboodiyyah).""(Al-Rooh p. 233)
2.Humbling oneself before the might, majesty and power of Allah.
Ibn al-Qayyim said:  
Every time he feels that he is great, he remembers the might of Allah and that might belongs to Him only, and he remembers His intense anger against those who compete with Him in that, then he humbles himself before Him and submits to the might of Allah. This is the ultimate humility and inevitably includes the first type of humility mentioned above, but the converse can never apply (i.e., this type of humility inevitably leads to the first type, but a person may submit to the commands and prohibitions of Allah but he does not humble himself before His might). 
The one who is truly humble is the one who is blessed with both. And Allah is the One Whose help we seek. 
Al-Rooh, p. 233. 
3.Humility in one’s dress and manner of walking.
It was narrated from Ibn ‘Umar that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whilst a man was letting his garment drag out of pride, he was swallowed up by the earth and will continue sinking in it until the Day of Resurrection.” 
Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3297. 
It was also narrated by al-Bukhari (5452) and Muslim (2088) from the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah. According to the version narrated by al-Bukhari: “Whilst a man was walking in a garment admiring himself with his hair nicely combed, Allah caused (the earth) to swallow him up and he will continue sinking in it until the Day of Resurrection.” 
4.Humility towards one who is of a lesser status and helping him
It was narrated that al-Bara’ ibn ‘Aazib said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was moving soil with us on the day of al-Ahzaab, and I saw him with dust covering the whiteness of his stomach, and he (the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)) was saying, “(O Allah)! Without You, we would not have been guided, nor would we have given in charity, nor would we have prayed. So (O Allah!) send tranquility (Sakeenah) upon us as they (the chiefs of the enemy tribes) have rebelled against us. And if they intend affliction (i.e. want to frighten us and fight against us) then we would not (flee but would withstand them).” And he raised his voice whilst saying it.  
Narrated by al-Bukhari, 6809; Muslim, 1803. 
5.Humility in interactions with one’s wife and helping her.
It was narrated that al-Aswad said: I asked ‘Aa’ishah what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to do in his house, and she said: He used to serve his family and when the time for prayer came he would go out and pray. 
al-Bukhari, 644.  
Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said: 
This shows that we are encouraged to be humble and not arrogant, and that a man should serve his family. 
Fath al-Baari, 2/163 
6.Humility towards the young and joking with them.
It was narrated that Anas said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was the best of people in character. I had a brother whose name was Abu ‘Umayr. He said, I think he was weaned, and when he (the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)) came he would say, “O Abu Umayr, what happened to the nughayr (a small bird that he kept as a pet)?” 
Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5850; Muslim, 2150. 
Al-Nawawi said: 
The nughayr is a small bird. 
This hadeeth teaches us many things, such as being kind to small children. This demonstrates the good character of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and how he was of noble character and humble. 
Sharh Muslim, 14/129 
7.Humility towards servants and slaves
It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If the servant of one of you brings his food and he does not want to make him sit and eat with him, then let him offer him a morsel or two, because he has prepared it and served it.”

Punishment for disrespecting parents in Islam","Praise be to Allah.Rights of parents in Islam
The rights of parents are great indeed. Allah mentions parents’ rights in conjunction with His own rights in many verses, for example, when He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Worship Allah and join none with Him (in worship); and do good to parents”
[al-Nisa 4:36] “And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. And that you be dutiful to your parents” [al-Isra 17:23] 
“And We have enjoined on man (to be dutiful and good) to his parents. His mother bore him in weakness and hardship upon weakness and hardship, and his weaning is in two years give thanks to Me and to your parents. Unto Me is the final destination” [Luqman 31:14]
And there are many similar verses. These verses indicate that it is obligatory to honour our parents , treat them kindly and thank them for their kindness to the child when he was in his mother’s womb and until he became independent and could take care of his own interests. 
Honouring parents includes spending on them when they are in need, hearing and obeying them with regard to things that are good and proper, lowering the wing of humility to them, not raising one’s voice to them, and addressing them with good words and politeness, as Allah says in Surah Bani Israil: 
“And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. And that you be dutiful to your parents. If one of them or both of them attain old age in your life, say not to them a word of disrespect, nor shout at them but address them in terms of honour. And lower unto them the wing of submission and humility through mercy, and say: ‘My Lord! Bestow on them Your Mercy as they did bring me up when I was young.’” [al-Isra 17:23-24]
In al-Sahihayn, it is narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was asked which deed is best. He said, “Prayer performed on time.” He was asked, then what? He said, “Honouring one’s parents.” He was asked, then what? He said, “Jihad for the sake of Allah.” 
And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The pleasure of Allah is in pleasing one’s father and the anger of Allah is in angering one’s father.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1821; classed as sahih by Ibn Hibban and al-Hakim, from the hadith of ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘As, may Allah be pleased with him). The version narrated by al-Tabarani refers to “parents” (instead of “father”). And there are very many hadiths which state that it is obligatory to honour one’s parents and treat them kindly. 
The opposite of honouring parents is disobeying them, which is one of the major sins, because it is proven in al-Sahihayn that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Shall I not tell you of the greatest of major sins?” – three times – and we said, “Yes, O Messenger of Allah.” He said: “Associating others in worship with Allah, and disobeying one’s parents,” – and he was reclining, but he sat up and said, “And false speech and false witness.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2654; Muslim, 126.  
In al-Sahihayn, it is also narrated from ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘As (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “One of the major sins is a man insulting his parents.” It was said, “O Messenger of Allah, do people really insult their parents?” He said, “Yes, a man insults another man’s father so he insults his father, or he insults another man's mother so he insults his mother.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5973; Muslim, 130. 
So the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) regarded causing one’s parents to be insulted as insulting them. So every Muslim man and woman must pay attention to honouring his or her parents and treating them kindly, especially when they grow old or are in need of kindness, honour and service; and they should beware of disobeying them or treating them badly in word or deed. (From the words of Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him), 8/306, 307) 
Punishment for disrespecting parents in Islam
Remind your brother of Allah and tell him to fear His punishment; show him the texts that warn against disobeying parents and explain to him the status of honouring parents in Islam , so that proof will be established against him and you will have discharged your duty before Allah. He should realize that he is sinning because of his abhorrent treatment of his parents and he is doing something that Allah has forbidden. But despite that do not despair of his being guided, and do not give up on trying to reconcile between your brother and his parents. But if you are unable to do that, then Allah does not burden any soul beyond its scope. 
Strive to find different ways of offering advice to your brother, sometimes by letting him hear a moving tape, sometimes by giving him a useful book on this topic. And you have to remind him that Allah may punish him through his children, because they may do the same to him as he is doing to his parents now, and so on… 
Another way of dealing with this is to look for the causes that are making him behave like this, then try to resolve them. It is clear that there are some psychological problems affecting many of those who disobey their parents, such as delaying marriage, or the presence of some evils in their homes that cause them to be disobedient, and so on.

One of the things on which there is scholarly consensus among all the Muslims, ancient and modern, past and present, is that Hajj or pilgrimage to the Sacred House of Allah is one of the five pillars of Islam, as proven in al-Sahihayn from the hadith of Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) and others. 
It is well known that Hajj , like other acts of worship, involves special actions, and each of these actions must be done in the prescribed manner, such as entering ihram from the miqat, tawaf, sa’i between al-Safa and al-Marwah, standing in ‘Arafah, staying overnight in Muzdalifah, stoning the Jamarat , slaughtering the sacrifice, and the other well-known actions of Hajj . All of these actions should be done in accordance with the teachings of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). There are very many ahadith which describe the Hajj of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him); these have been compiled by Imam Ibn al-Qayyim in Zad al-Ma’ad and by al-Hafiz Ibn Kathir in his book al-Bidayah wa’l-Nihayah; these scholars have also explained the rulings derived from these ahadith. The Muslim should pay attention to learning these rulings and acting upon them. 
Purpose of Hajj
Then we should remember that the basic purpose of the actions of Hajj is to establish the remembrance of Allah, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Then when you leave ‘Arafat, remember Allah (by glorifying His Praises, i.e. prayers and invocations) at the Mash‘ar-il-Haram. And remember Him (by invoking Allah for all good) as He has guided you, and verily, you were, before, of those who were astray. Then depart from the place whence all the people depart and ask Allah for His forgiveness. Truly, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most-Merciful.So when you have accomplished your Manasik [rituals of Hajj], remember Allah as you remember your forefathers or with a far more remembrance. But of mankind there are some who say: ‘Our Lord! Give us (Your Bounties) in this world!’ and for such there will be no portion in the Hereafter…And remember Allah during the appointed Days. But whosoever hastens to leave in two days, there is no sin on him and whosoever stays on, there is no sin on him, if his aim is to do good and obey Allah (fear Him), and know that you will surely be gathered unto Him.” [al-Baqarah 2:198-203]
‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “Tawaf around the House and sa’i between al-Safa and al-Marwah and the stoning of the jamarat were only prescribed so that the remembrance of Allah may be established.” It was classed as mu’allaq by al-Bayhaqi (5/145) and narrated as a marfu’ report, although there is some weakness in it. 
So the Muslim venerates the rituals of Hajj because Allah has commanded him to venerate them, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Thus it is and whosoever honours the Symbols of Allah, then it is truly, from the piety of the hearts.” [al-Hajj 22:32]
Al-Bukhari (1610) narrated that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) kissed the Black Stone and said, “Were it not that I had seen the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) kissing you, I would not have kissed you.” 
Actions of Hajj
Ibn al-Jawzi (may Allah have mercy on him) said, whilst discussing and explaining the actions of Hajj :  
“The background to these rituals is no longer present but the rulings remain in effect. These rituals may be confusing for some who see them and do not know the reasons for them, so they may say, ‘This does not make sense.’ I have explained the reasons for them as far as narrated reports go, now I will explain to you the meanings behind them. 
Note that the basis for acts of worship is something rational and comprehensible, which is the submission of the slave to his Lord and obedience to Him. Prayer involves humility and submission, which is what is meant by the word ‘ibadah (worship). 
Zakah involves kindness and helping the poor, so its meaning is clear. 
Fasting means suppressing the desires of the self so that it will be obedient to the One Whom it serves. 
Honouring the House and going there, and establishing a sanctuary (Haram) around it are acts of veneration. Arriving there unkempt and disheveled is like a slave turning to his Lord in humility and submission, and that is clear. A person feels at ease performing rituals that he understands, and that motivates him to do them, but to achieve full submission there are some rituals that a person may not understand, so he will not be at ease and will not comprehend them. In this case the only motive is to obey the commands of Allah. This is a greater form of humility and submission.” (Muthir al-‘Azm al-Sakin (1.285-286). 
History of Hajj
If this is understood, then much of the history of the actions of Hajj before the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is not known to us. In this case, it does not matter if we do not know. And there are some things concerning whose history a few indications are narrated in some texts; we will mention some of these here: 
When was Hajj enjoined? When did Hajj begin? 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And proclaim to mankind the Hajj (pilgrimage). They will come to you on foot and on every lean camel, they will come from every deep and distant (wide) mountain highway (to perform Hajj).” [al-Hajj 22:27]
Ibn Kathir says in his commentary on this verse (3/221): 
“This means: Proclaim (O Ibrahim) the Hajj to the people, calling them to come on pilgrimage to this House which We have commanded you to build. It was mentioned that he said, “O Lord, how can I proclaim it to the people when my voice does not reach them?” He said, “Call and We will convey it.” So he stood in his maqam (station) – or it was said, on the rock, or on al-Safa, or on Abu Qubays (a mountain) – and said: “O people, your Lord has taken a House, so come to it on pilgrimage.” And it was said that the mountains lowered themselves so that his voice could reach all parts of the earth and those who were still in the wombs or in men’s loins also heard, and everything that heard him, cities, nomad encampments and trees, and everyone whom Allah has decreed should perform Hajj until the Day of Resurrection responded, (saying) Labbayk Allahumma labbayk (Here I am, O Allah, here I am. This is the summary of what was narrated from Ibn 'Abbas, Mujahid, ‘Ikrimah, Sa’id ibn Jubayr and others among the salaf. And Allah knows best.” 
Ibn al-Jawzi, in his book Muthir al-‘Azm al-Sakin (1/354) narrated something similar, but more briefly, and he attributed it to the narrators of Sirah.  
This has to do with the history of the enjoining of Hajj before the sending of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
With regard to the enjoining of Hajj in Islam , there is some scholarly difference of opinion concerning that. It was said that it was enjoined in 6 AH, or in 7 AH, or in 9 AH, or in 10 AH. Imam Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) was certain that it was enjoined in 9 or 10 AH. He (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Zad al-Ma’ad:  
“There is no dispute that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not perform Hajj after he migrated to Madinah apart from one Hajj, which was the Farewell Pilgrimage. And there is no dispute that that occurred in 10 AH… When the command to perform Hajj was revealed, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) hastened to perform Hajj with no delay. Because the enjoining of Hajj came at a later stage, in 9 or 10 AH, one might say, How can you prove that the command to perform Hajj was delayed until 9 or 10 AH? We would say that the first part of Surah Al ‘Imran was revealed in the year of delegations (‘am al-wufud), during which the delegation from Najran came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and he made a treaty with them regarding their paying the jizyah, and the (ruling on) jizyah was revealed in the year of Tabuk, 9 AH, when the first part of Surah Al ‘Imran was revealed…” 
Al-Qurtubi said in his Tafsir (2/4/92): Hajj was known to the Arabs. When Islam came, they were told about something they already knew and what was enjoined upon them was something they were familiar with…” See also Ahkam al-Quran by Ibn al-‘Arabi, 1/286. 
Tawaf around the House 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and We commanded Ibrahim (Abraham) and Isma’il (Ishmael) that they should purify My House (the Ka‘bah at Makkah) for those who are circumambulating it, or staying (I‘tikâf), or bowing or prostrating themselves (there, in prayer).” [al-Baqarah 2:125]
This verse indicates that tawaf around the Ka’bah was known at the time of Ibrahim (peace be upon him). 
Raml 
Raml means walking quickly with short steps. This is Sunnah for men but not for women during the tawaf of arrival (tawaf al-qudum), which is the first tawaf performed when one arrives in Makkah. 
How did raml begin? 
Al-Bukhari narrated in his Sahih (2/469-470, 1602) and Muslim also narrated (2/991-992, 1262) that Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came with his Companions and the mushrikun said, “There have come to you people who have been weakened by the fever of Yathrib. So the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded them to walk quickly (raml) in the first three circuits… According to another report, he said, “Walk quickly so that the mushrikin will see that you are strong.” 
The water of Zamzam and sa’i between al-Safa and al-Marwah 
Al-Bukhari narrated in his Sahih (6/396-397, 3364) that Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said:  
“Ibrahim brought Hajar and her son Isma’il when she was still breastfeeding him, to a place near the Ka’bah under a tree on the spot of Zamzam, at the highest place in the mosque. During those days there was nobody in Makkah, nor was there any water. So he left them there and left with them a leather bag containing some dates, and a small water-skin containing some water, and set out homeward. Isma’il’s mother followed him saying, “O Ibrahim! Where are you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to enjoy)?” She repeated that to him many times, but he did not look at her. Then she asked him, “Has Allah commanded you to do this?” He said, “Yes.” She said, “Then He will not forsake us,” and went back while Abraham proceeded onwards. When he reached al-Thaniyah where they could not see him, he turned to face the Ka’bah, and raising both hands, invoked Allah saying the following prayer:  
“O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring to dwell in an uncultivable valley by Your Sacred House (the Ka‘bah at Makkah) in order, O our Lord, that they may perform As-Salah (Iqamat-as-Salah). So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allah) provide them with fruits so that they may give thanks.” [Ibrahim 14:37]
Isma’il’s mother went on breastfeeding Isma’il and drinking from the water (she had). When the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. She started looking at him (i.e. Isma’il) tossing in agony. She left him, for she could not endure looking at him, and found that the mountain of al-Safa was the nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could not see anybody. Then she descended from al-Safa and when she reached the valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble, till she crossed the valley and reached al-Marwah where she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between al-Safa and al-Marwah) seven times.  
Ibn 'Abbas said: 
“The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “This is the (origin of) the people’s sa’i (walking) between them between them (i.e. al-Safa and al-Marwah).” When she reached al-Marwah (for the last time) she heard a voice and she said to herself “Shh!” and listened attentively. She heard the voice again and said, “O, (whoever you may be)! You have made me hear your voice; have you got something to help me?” Then she saw an angel at the place of Zamzam, digging the earth with his heel (or his wing), until water appeared. She started to make something like a basin around it, using her hand in this way, and started filling her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water was flowing out after she had scooped some of it.” 
Ibn 'Abbas said: 
“The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “May Allah have mercy on the mother of Isma’il! Had she let Zamzam (flow without trying to control it) (or had she not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin), Zamzam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth.” And he said: “The angel said to her, ‘Do not be afraid of being neglected, for this is the House of Allah which will be built by this boy and his father, and Allah never neglects His people’…” 
Ibn al-Jawzi said in his book Muthir al-‘Azm al-Sakin (2/47): “This hadith explains the reason why it is called Zamzam, because when the water flowed, Hajar tried to control it (zammat-ha). The linguist Ibn Faris said: Zamzam comes from the words zamamtu al-naqah (I reined in the camel). 
Standing at ‘Arafah 
Abu Dawud and al-Tirmidhi (883) narrated that Yazid ibn Shayban said: 
“We were standing in ‘Arafah in a place far from the mawqif [where the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stood]. Ibn Mirba’ al-Ansari came to us and said, “I am the messenger of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who says to you: ‘Stay where you are (for it is also the place of standing), for you are standing in the area where your father Ibrahim stood.’” (Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud, 1688) 
Many of the actions of Hajj stem from the time of Ibrahim (peace be upon him), but the disbelievers introduced some innovations which were not prescribed. When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was sent, he opposed them and explained what was prescribed for the actions of Hajj.
