22802,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22802,How old will people be in Paradise?,How old will everybody be in paradise and will they grow or remain the same as they were when they first enter paradise? And please can you tell me why? Thank you very much!!! I will really apppreciate it!,,,"Praise be to Allah.Allah has prepared Paradise as a reward for His close friends who obey Him in this world and who are patient in following His commands and heeding His prohibitions. He has placed therein everything that is dear to them, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):
“(there will be) therein all that inner‑selves could desire, and all that eyes could delight in and you will abide therein forever” [al-Zukhruf 43:71]
It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said (that Allah said): ‘I have prepared for My righteous slaves that which no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and it has never entered the mind of man.’ Recite if you wish:
“No person knows what is kept hidden for them of joy as a reward for what they used to do” [al-Sajdah 32:17]
(al-Bukhari, 3244; Muslim 2824). 
Therefore we believe that the condition of those who enter Paradise will be the best and most perfect condition in all senses, whether we know the details of that or not. Knowing some of these details is something that makes the Muslim more interested and more motivated to do good deeds. 
One of the aspects of this perfect condition has to do with the ages of the people of Paradise. There is a hadeeth which states that they will enter Paradise “aged thirty-three years” (narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2545; classed as hasan by al-Albani in Takhreej al-Mishkaat, 5634). Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said concerning this age: “There is obvious wisdom behind this, for it is the most perfect age at which one is most able to enjoy physical pleasures, and the age at which one's health and strength are most perfect.” (Haadi al-Arwaah, p. 111). 
With regard to whether they will grow older, there are some ahaadeeth which do not confirm that they will not age. What has been proven from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is that they “will never lose their youth.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2539; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 2062). Whatever the case, it is certain from the principle established above that they will be in the most perfect condition, so they will remain young for ever and ever, and their delight will increase and never decrease, and they will live a good life and nothing will ever spoil their joy.
 We ask Allah by His grace and mercy to make us, you and all the Muslims among the people of that abode, and to help us to act in accordance with His religion and for the sake of His religion, until we meet Him when He is pleased with us, for He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

Wearing false nails that are long and look like the claws of wild animals is something that has come to us from the kuffaar; our sharee’ah enjoins us to cut our nails and not let them grow long, so why would we want to go against our sharee’ah?

One of them asked me whether I have any evidence for adding the word ta’aala (may He be exalted). I cannot find any evidence but I think I heard it from some of the virtuous scholars. 
Is it permissible to add this word to the greeting or not?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The word ta’aala is not narrated in the hadeeth. As this is the case, the Muslim should not say it, and he should limit himself to what was narrated in the Sunnah, which is to say “Al-salamu ‘alaykum wa rahmat-Allah  wa barakaatuhu (Peace be upon you, and the mercy of Allah and His blessings).” The word ta’aala is not part of the phrase that was narrated, and if a person keeps saying it then it becomes a habit or a “sunnah”, but it was not narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).

These include the following: 
1 – It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to seek protection for al-Hasan and al-Husayn and say: “Your father (i.e., Ibraaheem) used to seek protection by means of them (these words) for Ismaa’eel and Ishaaq: A’oodhu bi kalimaat-Allaah il-taammah min kulli shaytaanin wa haammah wa min kulli ‘aynin laammah (I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allaah from every devil and poisonous reptile, and from every envious evil eye).” 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3191. 
2 – It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was on a journey and got up or ended his journey in the last part of the night, he would say, “Sami’a saami’un bi hamdi Lillaah wa husni balaa’ihi ‘alayna. Rabbana saahibna wa afdil ‘alayna ‘aa’idhan Billaahi min al-naar (May a witness bear witness to our praise of Allaah for His favours and bounties upon us. Our Lord, protect us, show favour upon us and deliver us from every evil. I seek refuge in Allaah from the Fire).”  
Narrated by Muslim, 2718 
“Sami’a saami’un (literally, may a hearer hear us)” – al-Khattaabi said: This means, may a witness bear witness that we are praising Allaah for His blessings and favours. 
3 – It was narrated that Khawlah bint Hakeem al-Sulamiyyah said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “Whoever makes a stop on a journey and says, ‘A’oodhu bi kalimaat Allaah il-tammaati min sharri ma khalaqa (I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allaah from the evil of that which He has created),’ nothing will harm him until he moves on from that place.” 
Narrated by Muslim, 2708 
4 – It was narrated from Moosa al-Ash’ari that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was afraid of some people he would say, “Allaahumma inna naj’aluka fi nuhoorihim wa na’oodhu bika min shuroorihim (O Allaah, we ask You to repel them and we seek refuge in You from their evil).” 
Narrated by Abu Dawood, 1537; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 4706

    is not valid except when done by the one who is obliged to do it. Not praying is kufr which puts a person beyond the pale of Islam; see question 
    no. 2182. It is not permissible for you to offer prayers on behalf of someone else who 
    does not pray. This ruling is one upon which there is consensus and there is no difference of opinion among the scholars. 
Ibn Qudaamah said: “The visible acts of worship such as prayer, fasting, purifying oneself 
    (wudoo’) cannot be delegated to others because they have to do with the body of the person who is obliged to do them, so no one else can take his 
    place, except in the case of a vowed fast, which a person may do on behalf of one who has died, but this cannot be done by way of delegation.

22829,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22829,Ruling on touching books or magazines which contain verses of the Qur’aan for one who is menstruating or in a state of impurity following sexual activity (i.e. junub),"I know that it is not permissible to touch the Mus-haf (copy of the Qur’aan containing Arabic text only) unless one has wudoo’, but does this ruling apply to single verses or books of Tafseer (Qur’aanic commentary) or books of Seerah (Prophet’s biography) etc?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    It is not permissible for a person who is in a state of 
    impurity to touch a single aayah because the ruling on that is the same as 
    the ruling on the Mus-haf. But if there are other things written alongside 
    the aayah, as in books of Tafseer and Fiqh, then the ruling depends on which 
    is the greater; if there is more Qur’aan than anything else, then it is 
    haraam to touch it without wudoo’, but if there is more of writings other 
    than Qur’aan, then it is permissible to touch it. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have 
    mercy on him) said: “Anything on which there is Qur’aan comes under the same 
    rulings as the Mus-haf if there is only Qur’aan on it, but if other things 
    are written on it as well as Qur’aan, then the ruling depends on which is 
    the greater. It is permissible to touch books of tafseer, hadeeth, fiqh and 
    essays in which there is some Qur’aan.” (Sharh al-‘Uddah, 1/385).",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

“Verily, Allaah commands that you should render back the trusts to those, to whom they are due”
[al-Nisa’ 4:58]
Part of rendering back the trust is taking care of it; he must take care of it by putting it away in a suitable place. 
If he takes care of it by putting it away in a suitable place, and he is not negligent by either doing things that are not permitted or failing to do what he should, in this case he is not obliged to do anything. 
But if he is negligent and does not take care of it by putting it away in a suitable place, or he is negligent by putting it in a place where it will not be safe when he is able to put it in a safe place, or he disposes of it, or he uses it himself and so on, then after that it is stolen, then he is responsible for it.

22833,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22833,Eating out of forgetfulness in Ramadan does not matter,What is the ruling on one who eats or drinks out of forgetfulness during Ramadan?,,,"Praise be to Allah.That does not matter and his fast is valid, because Allah says at the end of Soorat al-Baqarah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error” [al-Baqarah 2:286]
It was narrated in a saheeh report from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that Allah said, “I have done that.” And it was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever forgets that he is fasting and eats or drinks, let him complete his fast, for the One Who fed him and gave him to drink was Allah.” (Agreed upon). 
The same applies if he has intercourse because of forgetfulness; his fast is still valid according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions, because of this aayah and this hadeeth, and because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever breaks his fast in Ramadaan out of forgetfulness, he does not have to make that day up and he does not have to offer any expiation (kafaarah).” (Narrated and classed as saheeh by al-Haakim). This wording includes intercourse and other things that break the fast, if the fasting person does them because of forgetfulness. This is from the mercy, bounty and kindness of Allah, for which we praise and thank Him.","Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, vol. 4, p. 193"
22836,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22836,The ratio of people of Paradise to people of Hell,In Saheeh al-Bukhaari there are two ahaadeeth (nos. 6529 and 6530 according to the numbering of Fath al-Baari). In hadeeth no. 6529 it says that the number of “those who are to be sent to Hell is ninety nine from every hundred.” And in hadeeth no. 6530 it says that the number of “those who are to be sent to Hell is nine hundred and ninety nine from every thousand.” I hope that you could comment and explain this. May Allaah reward you with good.,,,"Praise be to Allah.The first hadeeth was narrated by al-Bukhaari (6529) from Abu Hurayrah, that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The first one to be called on the Day of Resurrection will be Adam. He will be shown his progeny and it will be said, ‘This is your father Adam.’ He will say, ‘Here I am at Your service.’ He will say: ‘Bring forth those who are to be sent to Hell from among your progeny.’ He will say, ‘O Lord, how many should I bring forth?’ He will say, ‘Bring forth from every hundred ninety nine.’” They said: “O Messenger of Allaah, if ninety nine are taken from every hundred of us, what will be left of us?” He said, “My ummah, among the other nations, is like a white hair on a black bull.” 
The second hadeeth was narrated by al-Bukhaari (3348) and Muslim (222) from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allaah be pleased with him), that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah will say, ‘O Adam!’ and he will say, ‘Here I am at Your service, and all goodness is in Your hand.’ He will say, ‘Bring forth those who are to be sent to Hell.’ He will say, ‘Who are those who are to be sent to Hell?’ He will say, ‘From every thousand, nine hundred and ninety nine.’ At that point the young will turn grey, every pregnant female will abort, and the people will appear intoxicated although they are not. But the punishment of Allaah is severe.” They said, “O Messenger of Allaah, which of us will be that one?” He said, “Be of good cheer, for there will be one man from among you and one thousand from among Ya’jooj and Ma’jooj.” Then he said, “By the One in Whose hand is my soul, I hope that you will be one quarter of the people of Paradise,” and they said, “Allaahu akbar!” Then he said, “I hope that you will be one third of the people of Paradise,” and they said, “Allaahu akbar!” Then he said, “I hope that you will be half of the people of Paradise,” and they said, “Allaahu akbar!” Then he said, “Among the people you are like a black hair on the hide of a white bull, or like a white hair on the hide of a black bull.” 
According to the first hadeeth, the number of those who will be saved on the Day of Resurrection is ten in a thousand. According to the second hadeeth it is one in a thousand. 
The scholars have reconciled between these two ahaadeeth in several ways, such as the following: 
1 – The numbers are not to be taken literally, so stating a particular number does not mean that there may not be more than that. What is meant by the two numbers mentioned in the two hadeeth is the small number of believers and the large number of kaafirs. 
2 – The hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri may be understood as referring to all the progeny of Adam, so there will be one in every thousand (who goes to Paradise), and the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah may be understood as referring to everyone except Ya’jooj and Ma’jooj, so that the number is ten in every thousand. This is supported by the fact that Ya’jooj and Ma’jooj are mentioned in the hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed but not in the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah. 
3 – It may be that the division will happen twice: once involving all the nations who came before this ummah, when the number will be one in every thousand, and again for this ummah only, when the number will be ten in every thousand. 
4 – It may be that what is meant by “those who are to be sent to Hell” is the kaafirs and the sinners [from among the Muslims] who will enter it, so that from every thousand nine hundred and ninety nine kaafirs are sent, and from every hundred ninety-nine sinners are sent.

If using water will make you sick, then it is permissible for you to do tayammum. 
The Standing Committee for Research and Issuing Fatwas was asked: 
What is the definition of sickness whereby it is permissible to do tayammum even though water is available? 
The Committee replied: 
It is sickness where there is the fear that using water may make the sickness worse or delay the healing of wounds. 
Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 5/345 
Secondly: 
The ruling on urinary incontinence and continual passing of wind is the same as the ruling on istihaadah (prolonged non-menstrual vaginal bleeding). Urine, wind and vaginal bleeding all invalidate Wudu, and Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allaah does not want to place you in difficulty, but He wants to purify you, and to complete His Favour to you that you may be thankful”
[al-Maa'idah 5:6] 
“Allaah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you”
[al-Baqarah 2:185]
So people suffering from these problems are allowed to do Wudu for each prayer when the time for that prayer has begun, then they should pray as they are, even if some wind, urine or blood comes out of them whilst they are praying.  
This ruling is for one who passes wind continually. If that is intermittent, and he can do the prayer during the time when it stops, then he has to do Wudu and pray at the time when the wind has stopped. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: There are two scenarios with regard to one who suffers from urinary incontinence: 
1 – If it is continual and does not stop, and every time something collects in the bladder it comes down, then he should do Wudu when the time for prayer has begun, then put something over his private part and pray, and it does not matter what comes out. 
2 – If that happens after he urinates, or ten minutes or quarter of an hour after that, then he should wait until it stops, then do Wudu and pray, even if he misses the prayer in congregation.  
The basic principle is that Wudu should be done after the time for the prayer has begun. 
It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah said: Faatimah bint Abi Hubaysh came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said, “O Messenger of Allaah, I am a woman who suffers from istihaadah (prolonged non-menstrual vaginal bleeding) and I never become pure. Should I give up praying?” The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No, rather that is a vein and it is not hayd (menstruation). When your period comes, stop praying, and when it goes away, wash the blood from yourself and pray, then do Wudu for every prayer until that time [of menstruation] comes.” 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 226; Muslim, 333 
With regard to prayers where doing Wudu after the time for them begins is difficult, such as Jumu’ah and Eid, it is permissible to do Wudu shortly before the time begins. 
The Standing Committee was asked about a man who passes wind continually – how should he do Wudu and pray? 
The Committee replied: 
If your situation is as you describe, and you suffer from continual wind, then you have to do Wudu for each prayer after the time for the prayer begins, then it does not matter what comes out of you after that. With regard to Jumu’ah, do Wudu for it before the khateeb comes in, which will enable you to listen to the khutbah and perform the prayer. 
Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah. 5/412 
If it is difficult for you to do Wudu for every prayer and offer the prayer on time, then it is permissible for you to join Zuhr and ‘Asr and pray them at the time of either with one Wudu, and to join Maghrib and ‘Isha’ similarly with one Wudu 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) granted a concession to the women who suffered from istihaadah, allowing her to join her prayers. This was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 284 
You can pray qiyaam al-layl – Taraaweeh – with the Wudu you did for ‘Isha’. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: 
Is it permissible for a woman who is suffering istihaadah to pray qiyaam al-layl with the Wudu of ‘Isha’ if half the night has passed? 
He replied: 
This issue is one concerning which there is a difference of opinion. Some scholars say that if half the night has passed, she must repeat her Wudu. And it was said that she does not have to repeat her Wudu, which is more correct. 
Fataawa al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah, 1/292, 293 
With regard to Duha prayer, the time for it is limited, so it is essential to do Wudu for it after the time has begun. It lasts from a quarter of an hour after the sun has risen until approximately quarter of an hour before Zuhr. 
And  Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: 
Is it permissible for that woman to pray Duha with the Wudu she did for Fajr? 
He replied: 
That is not permissible, because there is a limited time for Duha prayer, so it is essential to do Wudu for it after its time has begun. This woman is like one who suffers from istihaadah, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded the woman who suffered from istihaadah to do Wudu for each prayer.

If the muezzin is giving the adhaan for subh (fajr) (he is giving the adhaan when dawn has really started), then you must stop eating and drinking, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Do not stop your suhoor when you hear the adhaan of Bilaal, for he gives the adhaan at night, so eat and drink until Ibn Umm Maktoom gives the adhaan.” The basis for this appears in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and eat and drink until the white thread (light) of dawn appears to you distinct from the black thread (darkness of night)”
[al-Baqarah 2:187]
If it is known that dawn has come, even without any adhaan, such as when one is in the desert etc., when you see the dawn then you should stop eating and drinking even if you do not hear the adhaan. 
But if the muezzin gives the adhaan too early or there is any doubt concerning whether his adhaan has coincided with the dawn or not, then you may eat and drink until you are certain that the dawn has started, whether that is known from a reliable timetable or from a trustworthy adhaan which is known to come at the time of dawn. In this case (if the adhaan is too early) you may eat whilst the adhaan is being given, you may eat or drink what is in your hand, because there is no certainty that the adhaan is being given at the right time, rather it is possible.","Majmoo Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, vol. 15, p. 282"
22845,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22845,The phenomenon of cheating,The phenomenon of cheating is widespread in society. What is the attitude of Islam towards this phenomenon?,,,"Praise be to Allah.In the Quran, Allah has condemned cheating and the people who do it, and has warned them of bad consequences. This may be understood from the words (interpretation of the meaning):
“Woe to Al‑Mutaffifoon (those who give less in measure and weight).
Those who, when they have to receive by measure from men, demand full measure,
And when they have to give by measure or weight to (other) men, give less than due” [Al-Mutaffifeen 83:1]
This is a severe warning to those who cheat (by giving less) in weights and measures, so how about those who steal, embezzle and withhold from the people the things that are their due? These are more deserving of the warning than those who cheat in weights and measures.
The Prophet of Allah Shu’ayb warned his people against reducing the value of people’s property and cheating in weights and measures, as Allah has told us in the Quran.
Similarly the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cautioned us against cheating and issued a warning to the one who does this. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) passed by a pile of food and put his hand into it, and his fingers touched something wet. He said, “What is this, O seller of the food?” The man said, “It got rained on, O Messenger of Allah.” He said, “Why did you not put it (the wet part) on top of the pile so that the people could see it? He who deceives does not belong to me.” According to other reports, “He who deceives us is not one of us,” or, “He is not one of us who deceives us.” (Narrated by Muslim).
The wording of the version narrated by al-Nawawi, “he is not one of us”, is sufficient warning against cheating and sufficient deterrent against indulging in this heinous sin.
We need desperately to instill this message in our hearts so that we might stir the conscience and be aware that Allah is watching all that we do, without the need for any human supervisor.
The way we deal with this phenomenon and other destructive phenomena that exist in society should not be like a patient who has a problem in his appendix and needs surgery, but instead they heat up a poultice for him and put it on that spot to relieve the pain… for then the patient will die before they even think of calling the doctor.
Here we will examine the phenomenon of cheating, now that you know the warnings that apply to it.
Definition of cheating:
Al-Mannaawi said: Cheating is that which mixes bad with good.
Ibn Hajar al-Haythami said: the forbidden type of cheating is when the owner of the goods knows something which, if the would-be purchaser knew about it, he would not pay that amount of money for it.
Al-Kafawi said: cheating causes blackness of the heart and frowning on the face, hence this word (ghish = cheating or deceit) is also used (in Arabic) to refer to hatred or enmity.
Where cheating takes place:
The one who thinks about what happens in real life will find that many people engage in some form of cheating in all areas of their lives. Examples of that include:
1 – Cheating in buying and selling:
How often this happens nowadays in the marketplaces of the Muslims! It may take the form of concealing faults in goods or other ways such as deceiving people about the quality of a product, or its components, quantity, weight, essential features or source.
These are some of the ways in which that cheating is manifested:
1-Some fruit-sellers put a lot of leaves or papers in the bottom of the basket of fruit, then they put the best fruit at the top. In this manner they deceive the purchaser and cheat him by making him think that the basket is full from top to bottom, and that all the fruit is of the same quality as that which he sees on the top.
2-Some of them get food oil and mix it with perfume, with the larger proportion being of oil. Then they put it in glass bottles, and this substance smells like perfume, and they sell it for a low price.
3-Some traders buy a product in a very light wrapper, then they put it in a much thicker wrapper, maybe five times thicker. Then they sell the wrapper and its contents, weighing the whole lot and charging for both the wrapper and the contents.
4-Some traders do some light mending on clothes, then they sell them without explaining that they have been mended, rather they swear by Allah that they are new – may they perish!
5-Some of them may wear a garment until it loses its value, then they shorten it and put some starch in it, to make people think that it is new, and they sell it as if it is new.
6-Some perfume-sellers put some products, such as saffron, near water so that they may absorb the moisture, thus increasing the weight by approximately one-third.
7-Some vendors and shopkeepers make their stores very dark by using coloured lights, so that rough products will look smooth and ugly ones will look beautiful. The Shaytaan makes their evil deeds attractive to them.
8-Some goldsmiths mix gold with copper and the like, then they sell it as if it is pure gold.
9-Some of them buy clean second-hand gold, then they offer it for sale at the price of new without telling the purchaser that it is second-hand.
10-Some vendors at car auctions put thick oil in the car engine so that the purchaser will think that it is in good condition.
11-Some of them turn back the odometer, if it shows that the car has traveled a great distance, to trick the purchaser into thinking that the car has only been used a little.
12-Some of them, if they have a car that they want to sell and they know that it has a hidden fault, will say to the one who wants to buy it, “Try this car if you want to buy it,” without telling him anything about it. By Allah, this is cheating and deceit.
13-Some of them describe many faults in the car which are not real, with the intention of concealing the real faults of the vehicle behind these imaginary faults.
Even worse than that is when they do not mention the faults until after the sale has been made and the deposit paid, and the purchaser is not able to inspect the car and is not allowed to do so.
14-Some of them, if they have a car that they want to sell, will praise it and swear by Allah that it is good, and they will fabricate reasons why they want to sell it, but Allah knows all secrets and that which is yet more hidden.
15-Some of them agree with their friends to increase the price so that someone else will take it. This is the najsh (artificial inflation of prices) which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade.
16-Another kind of cheating in selling is when butchers inflate the animal carcass that they want to sell so that the purchaser will think that it is all meat.
17-Some vendors at sheep auctions and places where chickens are sold feed the animals salt [to make them drink more and thus look fatter], so that the purchaser will think that they are fat when they are not.
18-Some owners of cattle etc. tie up the teats of milking-animals a few days before selling them so that this will look like milk when it is not.

I leave it for you to add more examples of cheating in buying and selling that may cross your mind. May Allah protect you, if you are a seller or a buyer, from cheating or doing any of the things described above.
2 – Cheating in matters of marriage
These are some of the ways in which this cheating is manifested:
1-Some fathers may offer a man who comes to marry one of his daughters his youngest daughter who is still a virgin, then on the wedding night he finds out that he has been given the older, previously-married daughter. Some men can find no escape and no way out from such a marriage.
2-Some fathers and guardians of women show the suitor the daughter who is beautiful, then on the wedding night he finds out that he has been given a different daughter who is ugly, but he has no choice but to accept the situation.
3-Some fathers may conceal some sickness or fault that may be present in the daughter, not telling the suitor so that he may have a clear picture. Then when he goes in unto her on the wedding night he discovers the sickness or fault.
4-Some fathers and guardians of women, if the suitor asks to see the woman – which is permissible so long as the conditions stipulated in Islam are met – give him permission to do so after they fill her face will all kinds of colours and dyes, i.e. “make-up”, so that she will appear beautiful to him, but if he looked at her without that mask of make-up he would not be pleased with her. Is this not cheating which leads to great corruption of the rights of both husband and wife?
5-Some guardians marry off the female under their care without making the effort to find out about the suitor and how religiously committed he is or what his attitude is like. This is a kind of cheating and wrongdoing against the wife.
6-Another kind of cheating in marriage is when the suitor pretends to have what he does not, to make it appear that he is a man of status and that he owns a lot of real estate and cars. He may even go to the extent of hiring a luxury car, spending hundreds of riyals, to give the impression that he owns it, when in fact he does not own anything.
7-Another kind of cheating is when some people praise the suitor before the people whose daughter he wishes to marry, speaking of him in the highest terms and describing him as one who prays and is righteous, even though this suitor does not even know the way to the mosque.
Enough of this cheating and deception which destroys homes and breaks up families!
8-A form of cheating done by some women – especially those who are older – is when they file their teeth to create nice-looking gaps between them, thus making an older woman look young, so that the suitor will think that she is young, then when he marries her he discovers that she is very old. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed the women who file their teeth for the purpose of beauty and alter the creation of Allah.
3 – Cheating in naseehah (sincere advice)
The whole point of giving advice is to help a person meet his worldly objectives or his religious objectives. One of the mutual rights of brotherhood among the believers is to be sincere towards one another, and the hypocrites are cheats.
The believer is the mirror of his brother, so if he sees some fault in him he should correct it. Sincerity means refraining from harming the Muslims, teaching them about matters of their religion of which they are unaware, and helping them to adhere to it in word and in deed, covering their faults, filling their gaps, warding off harm from them, bringing things that will benefit them, enjoining what is good upon them and forbidding what is evil in a kind and sincere manner, showing compassion towards them, respecting their elders, being merciful towards their young, giving them good advice and choosing the appropriate time for doing so, loving for them what one loves for oneself of goodness and hating for them what one hates for oneself of disliked things.
Al-Haafiz Abu’l-Qaasim al-Tabaraani narrated with his isnaad that Jareer ibn ‘Abd-Allah al-Bajali (may Allah be pleased with him) commanded his freed slave to buy a horse for him. So he bought him a horse for three hundred dirhams, and he brought the horse and its owner to him so that he could pay him the money. Jareer said to the owner of the horse – look at this sincerity – “Your horse is worth more than three hundred dirhams. Will you sell it for four hundred dirhams?” He said, “Yes, O Abu ‘Abd-Allah.”
He said, “Your horse is worth more than four hundred dirhams. Will you sell it for five hundred dirhams?” He kept increasing it by one hundred each time, with the owner agreeing and Jareer saying, “Your horse is worth more than that,” until he reached eight hundred, for which price he bought it. And he said concerning that, “I gave my oath of allegiance (bay’ah) to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that I would be sincere towards every Muslim.”
4 – Cheating in positions of authority
It was narrated that Ma’qal ibn Yassaar al-Muzani (may Allah be pleased with him) said during his final illness: “I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: ‘There is no person whom Allah has put in a position of authority and he dies on the day he dies cheating those under his authority, but Allah will forbid Paradise for him.’” This was narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim; this version was narrated by Muslim. According to one of the two versions narrated by al-Bukhaari: “There is no Muslim whom Allah places in a position of authority over people and he is not sincere towards them, but he will not smell the fragrance of Paradise.”
This is a stern warning which includes everyone whom Allah has placed in a position of authority, whether great or small, starting from the individuals of a royal family. Everyone must be sincere towards those who are under their authority, and not cheat or deceive them.
So an employee must be sincere in his work and do it in the manner required by sharee’ah, without cheating or deceiving anyone, and without delaying work for people. He should realize that he will stand before Allah and that Allah has only given him this job so that he can be sincere towards the Muslims.
Similarly a father must be sincere towards his children and not neglect their upbringing, rather he must do all that he can to save himself and his children from a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones, over which are appointed angels stern and severe (cf. al-Tahreem 66:6).
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “How many people have caused misery to their own children, the apples of their eyes, in this world and in the Hereafter, by neglecting them, not disciplining them, encouraging them to follow their whims and desires, thinking that they were honouring them when they were in fact humiliating them, that they were being merciful to them when in fact they were wronging them. They have not benefited from having a child, and they have made the child lose his share in this world and in the Hereafter. If you think about the corruption of children you will see that in most cases it is because of the parents.”
(Tuhfat al-Mawlood, p. 146)
5 – Cheating in exams
How many ways and means of cheating there are among the students! The reason for that is the lack of any religious deterrent, weakness of faith, and the lack of any sense that Allah is always watching.
Our Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “It was narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Whoever cheats us is not one of us.’ This includes cheating in dealing with others and cheating in exams, including English-language exams. It is not permissible for students to cheat in exams in any subject, because of the general meaning of this hadeeth and other similar reports. And Allah is the Source of strength.”
These are some of the ways in which cheating is manifested, and there are others, for this is just a drop in the ocean,
“so that those who were to be destroyed (for their rejecting the Faith) might be destroyed after a clear evidence, and those who were to live (i.e. believers) might live after a clear evidence” [Al-An’aam 8:42 – interpretation of the meaning]
To everyone who has committed some form of cheating, whether it is mentioned here or not, we say: fear Allah and remember that the Knower of the Unseen is always watching you. Remember His punishment and torment:
“Verily, your Lord is Ever Watchful (over them)” [Al-Fajr 89:14]
Realize that this world is transient and that the Reckoning will examine the smallest details; righteous deeds benefit one's children while bad deeds adversely affect them.  Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And let those (executors and guardians) have the same fear in their minds as they would have for their own, if they had left weak offspring behind. So let them fear Allah and speak right words” [Al-Nisa’ 4:9]
Whoever ponders the meaning of this aayah will fear the bad effects that evil deeds may have on his children and will refrain from them lest something like this happen to them.
And it should be noted that cheating is very harmful, which may be explained as follows:
The harmful effects of cheating include:
1-Cheating is a way that leads to Hell.
2-It is indicative of the mean and evil nature of a person. No one does this except one who is ignoble and does not care about his soul, so he causes it to indulge in that which will cause its doom and destruction.
3-It alienates one from Allah and from other people.
4-It causes one’s du’aa’s not to be accepted.
5-It causes one to be deprived of barakah (blessing) in one's wealth and one's life.
6-It is indicative of a lack of faith.
7-It is the reason that leads to being overpowered by the oppressors and kaafirs. Ibn Hajar al-Haythami said: “Because of these evil actions – i.e., cheating – that are committed by traders, workers and craftsmen, Allah caused the oppressors to gain power over them and take their wealth and violate the sanctity of their women. Indeed, He enabled the kuffaar to gain power over them, so they took them prisoner and enslaved them, and made them taste all kinds of torment and humiliation.
Cases where the kuffaar gained power over the Muslims, taking them prisoner and confiscating their property, taking their wealth and women, have happened a great deal in recent times, because of evil deeds that traders and others have committed, cheating in many different ways, because of the enormity of these crimes, deceit and trickery by means of which they took the wealth of the Muslims in any way they could, and did not feel that Allah is always watching them.",From al-Ghish by Zaahir al-Shahri

Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about a man who said to his wife, “I 
    don’t want you” a number of times. He said: These words do not constitute divorce if that was not his intention. This is a hint but is not 
    divorce. His wife is still his wife, and he does not have to do anything.

22854,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22854,"If a woman lengthens her garment by a handspan, it will lead to the garment getting dirty, so how can she pray in it?","My question is referring to an answer which said that the Prophet (saw) allowed women for thir jilbaabs to trail on the floor as so to cover their bodies completely, but if we were to do this would this not collect the dirt and filth that may be present on the ground, therefore if we were to pray would this nullify the prayer?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The society of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them all) was extremely keen to protect women and cover their ‘awrahs, and a woman is all ‘awrah, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said. So when a woman goes out she should cover her entire body, even her feet. Hence they used to make a “tail” i.e., a woman would make her garment long so that it would be like a tail behind her, so that nothing of her body would show. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: This is what they did when they went outside the house. But inside the house they did not wear that.""(Majmoo’ al-Fatawa, 22/119)
What you have said – may Allah guide you – about her garment getting dirty, is as nothing in comparison with the idea of protecting women and closing the door to evil and fitnah (temptation) in society. 
You should note that the basic principle is that women should stay in their houses, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And stay in your houses” [Al-Ahzaab 33:33]
So women should not go out unless it is necessary. 
With regard to what you mention about the clothes getting dirty, and that some impurity (najaasah) may get into them, that is possible. This question was raised at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). It was narrated that the umm walad [a concubine who had borne a child to her master] of Ibraaheem ibn ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn ‘Awf said: I used to drag my ‘tail’ (i.e., let my garment drag along the ground) and I would pass through filthy places and clean places. Umm Salamah entered upon me and I asked her about that, and she said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “What comes after it purifies it.” (Narrated by Imam Ahmad, 25949; al-Tirmidhi, 143; Ibn Maajah, 531.

    You should note that we are not obliged to define our stance 
    or opinion on every issue or event that occurs, simply because much of what 
    occurs does not concern us. With regard to the things that do concern us and 
    on which we should form opinions, they are of different types: 

    1 – Matters which because of their depth and breadth go 
    beyond the limits of our knowledge and understanding. Concerning these 
    matters we must consult the opinions of specialists, scholars, researchers 
    or experts, as much as possible. 

    2 – Matters which are so clear that they have become the talk 
    of gatherings and the media. We can form an opinion on such matters by 
    reconciling between the views of those whom we trust and some of the 
    reports. 

    3 – Matters within our own private circle. These require us 
    to look at all the alternatives and weigh up the pros and cons of each, then 
    compare them objectively. This will enable us to form an initial idea, then 
    we can consult others and seek the opinions of people who have prior 
    experience in this field, or those whose opinions we trust. Whoever consults 
    people will benefit from their experience and knowledge. As time goes by and 
    we make mistakes and benefit from our experience, we will accumulate 
    experience and more understanding, and will develop the ability to evaluate 
    things. In the light of this experience we will be able to form our own 
    opinions.

I hope that you can explain to me the ruling on taking part in these competitions, quoting whatever you can from the fatwas of well-known scholars on this subject so that I can have a good idea. May Allah reward you with good.","Contemporary scholars differ with regard to offering prizes in order to attract customers and there are two views, one of which is that it is not allowed at all, and the other is that it may be permissible, so long as certain conditions are met.",,"Praise be to Allah.Offering prizes in order to attract a greater number of customers is a modern issue in marketing due to the competition that exists in the marketplace and the keenness of sellers to promote their products. Contemporary scholars differ with regard to this issue and there are two views, one of which is that it is not allowed at all, and the other is that it may be permissible, so long as certain conditions are met. 
Among those who are of the view that it is not allowed and is prohibited are the scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas and Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him). There follow some of their Fatwas: 
The Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas was asked: There are some food stores in America that, when you buy from them, give you some numbers. When you have collected a certain amount of numbers as stipulated by the store, you get a prize, namely a sum of money. Is it permissible for a Muslim to take this prize, knowing that he has not paid anything for it, and it is simply because he has bought from the store or has visited the store that he has been given these numbers through which he won that prize. 
They replied: 
“If the matter is as described, it is not permissible for you to take this prize which is given by the store because of your buying from them or because you visited them. Your choosing these numbers which were unknown to you at the time when you chose them and became known only after you chose them is a kind of gambling, and it is known that gambling is prohibited according to the Quran and Sunnah and the consensus of the scholars.”  (Fatwa no. 5847. ""(Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da`imah, 15/191)
 The Standing Committee was also asked: There are some merchants who sell a certain item for one hundred Riyals, which is sold by other for approximately twenty Riyals, with a chance to win a prize of a car or some other prize, and the people rush to buy from them because they want to win that prize. Is this permissible? Please advise us, may Allah reward you with good. 
They replied: 
“What you have asked about is not permissible, rather it is an evil action and a kind of gambling which Allah has forbidden because it involves risks and deceit, and consuming people’s wealth unlawfully. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):

They replied: 
“The prizes that are given to callers using the public phones in centres are not permissible because that involves gambling and deceiving the people and consuming their wealth unlawfully in order to promote use of the telephones and increase the company’s earnings from them, as well as the enmity that it stirs up among the owners of the centres themselves and the callers.

My question is: 
1 – What is the ruling on taking part in this draw with this ticket that is given for free, and the participant does not lose anything if he does not win? 
2 – What is the ruling on buying from that co-op with the intention of getting the ticket mentioned so that one can take part in the competition?

The authorities and scholars in Fujayrah and elsewhere should denounce these competitions and warn against them, because that goes against the Book of Allah and is also consuming the people’s wealth unlawfully. May Allah bless us all with guidance and adherence to the truth.” (Majallat Ad-Da’wah, issue no. 1145, dated 29/10/1408 AH) 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) discussed in detail the ruling on taking part in these competitions. He said that it is permissible so long as two conditions are met. He said:  
Companies nowadays offer prizes to those who buy from them. We say that there is nothing wrong with these so long as two conditions are met: 

The price – of the goods purchased – should be their true price, i.e., the price should not be raised because of the prize. If the price is raised because of the prize then this is gambling and is not permissible. 
The customer should not buy the product in order to win the prize. If he buys it only because he wants to win the prize, and he has no need for the product, then this is a waste of money. We have heard that some people buy a carton of milk or yoghurt which they do not need, but they hope that they will win a prize, so you see them buying it then throwing it away in the market or outside the house. This is not permissible, because it is a waste of money, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade wasting money.” ( As’ilat Al-Bab Al-Maftuh, no. 1162) 

This view is more correct – in sha Allah – so long as a person is certain that he is fulfilling the second condition, because he is the only one who knows what he feels in his heart; no other human being can know that.

I am afraid that if I tell them that this is haraam, this will lead to breaking of the ties of kinship.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to sell gold for money unless the gold and the money are handed over in the same sitting. This is what has been stated by the fuqaha’. This is called taqaabud (a reciprocal taking possession of commodity and its monetary equivalent by buyer and seller respectively), in which the buyer takes the gold, and the seller takes the money (in the same sitting). It is not permissible to sell gold if there is no taqaabud. See question no. 65919 . 
What you have to do is to explain this to those who buy from you, and what a Muslim has to do is to listen and obey whatever Allaah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) have commanded. You are not doing this because you do not trust them, for example, rather you are doing it in order to follow the sharee’ah. You should explain this in a kind and gentle manner. 
Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: 
What is the ruling on giving gold before receiving the money for it, if it is given to a relative because of the fear of severing the ties of kinship and I am aware that he will pay for it even if that is after some time? 
He replied: 
You should be aware of the general principle that it is not permissible to sell gold for money at all unless the price is paid in full immediately. It makes no difference if the customer is a relative or a stranger, because the religion of Allaah does not favour one at the expense of the other. If your relative gets angry with you for obeying Allaah, then let him get angry, for he is the wrongdoer and sinner who wants you to disobey Allaah, and in fact you have honoured him by preventing him from entering into a kind of transaction with you that is haraam. If he gets angry or cuts off ties with you for this reason, then he is the sinner and there is no sin on you.

Dealing in riba is haraam and is a major sin. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Fear Allaah and give up what remains (due to you) from Ribaa (from now onward) if you are (really) believers.
279. And if you do not do it, then take a notice of war from Allaah and His Messenger but if you repent, you shall have your capital sums. Deal not unjustly (by asking more than your capital sums), and you shall not be dealt with unjustly (by receiving less than your capital sums)” [al-Baqarah 2:278-278]
Secondly: 
Once it is established that it is haraam to deal in riba, then it is also haraam to help others in that in any way whatsoever. That is because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Help you one another in Al‑Birr and At‑Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression” [al-Maa’idah 5:2]
Based on this, it is not permissible for you to rent a place to a bank that deals in riba, because that is helping the bank in this major sin, namely riba. It was proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed the one who consumes riba, the one who pays it, the one who writes it down and the two who witness it, and he said: “They are all the same.” Narrated by Muslim, 1598. 
Al-Nawawi said: This indicates that it is haraam to cooperate in falsehood. 
Al-Sindi said: All of them are cursed for their participation in sin. 
The scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas were asked: 
I own a building and one of the banks applied to rent it. This bank is one of those that deal in riba. Is it permissible for me to rent it to this bank and others that deal in riba, or not? 
They replied: 
That is not permissible, because the bank mentioned is going to use it as a place for dealing in riba, which is haraam. Renting it to them for this purpose is helping them in doing something haraam. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Help you one another in Al‑Birr and At‑Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression” [al-Maa’idah 5:2]
Fataawa Islamiyyah, 2/423, 424 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz said: 
There are many verses and ahaadeeth which indicate that it is haraam to cooperate in sin. By the same token it is haraam to rent property to owners of banks that deal in riba, because of the evidence mentioned. Fataawa Islamiyyah, 2/395 
The rent that you take from the bank is haraam wealth, which you must get rid of by giving it in charity. You must hasten to do that, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Every body that is nourished on haraam things, the Fire is more fitting for it.” Narrated by al-Tabaraani; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 4519. 
With regard to the rent that you took before you knew that it is haraam, it is permissible for you, because Allaah said, when He revealed the prohibition of riba (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So whosoever receives an admonition from his Lord and stops eating Ribaa, shall not be punished for the past; his case is for Allaah (to judge)” [al-Baqarah 2:275]

22872,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22872,Is it prescribed to boycott innovators in this day and age?,When is it prescribed to boycott innovators (followers of bid’ah)? When is it prescribed to hate for the sake of Allaah? Is it prescribed to boycott them in this day and age?,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The believer should analyze the situation in the light of 
    faith and sharee’ah, and ignore his whims and desires. If his shunning and 
    keeping away from the innovator will not result in a greater evil, then it 
    is prescribed, and at the very least it is Sunnah. Similarly, shunning those 
    who openly commit sin is at the very least Sunnah. But if not shunning them 
    will be more effective because one thinks that calling these innovators, 
    guiding them to the Sunnah and teaching them what Allaah has enjoined upon 
    them will be more effective in guiding them, then he should not hasten to 
    shun them, but he should hate them for the sake of Allaah just as he hates 
    the kaafirs and sinners. But his hatred for the kuffaar should be greater, 
    whilst also calling them to Allaah and striving to guide them, acting in 
    accordance with all the shar’i evidence. So he should hate the innovator in 
    accordance with the degree of his innovation, so long as it does not imply 
    kufr, and he should hate the sinner in accordance with the degree of his 
    sin, but he should also love him for the sake of Allaah in accordance with 
    the degree of his Islam and faith. From this we know that shunning depends 
    on the situation. 

    Conclusion: the most correct approach is to look at the 
    shar’i interests involved, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) shunned some people and not others, depending on the 
    objectives of Islam. He shunned Ka’b ibn Maalik and his two companions (may 
    Allaah be pleased with them) when they stayed behind from the campaign of 
    Tabook with no excuse. He shunned them for fifty days, until they repented 
    and Allaah accepted their repentance. But he did not shun ‘Abd-Allaah ibn 
    Ubayy ibn Salool and a group of those who were accused of hypocrisy, for 
    shar’i reasons. 

    The believer looks at what is in the best interests (of 
    Islam). This does not contradict the idea of hating the kaafirs, innovators 
    and sinners for the sake of Allaah and loving the Muslims for the sake of 
    Allaah. Attention must be paid to what is in the general interest; if 
    shunning is better then they should be shunned, but if the objectives of 
    Islam dictate that ongoing da’wah efforts should be made rather than 
    shunning, then that is what should be done, following the teaching of the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). And Allaah is the 
    Source of strength.","Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah li Samaahat al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him), 9/423"
22877,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22877,What to Do When You Are Losing Faith in Islam,"I have been a religious person for several years, but for a few months I have been feeling that my mind and heart are devoid of faith and will power. This matter is tormenting me and I said to myself that perhaps this is a touch from the devil or something like that, and it will go away when Ramadan comes. But it has not gone away and I find it very difficult to pray Qiyam Al-Layl (night prayers).
I have tried to read more Quran despite these insinuating whispers and the distress it is causing me. My situation has started to affect me socially, at work, in the family and in my religion. 
Now I am living in torment because of this and I cannot find the faith which I feel has been taken away from me. I feel that I will have a bad end and that my faith will never return to me and that a seal has been placed over my heart. When I go to the mosque to pray, which I have not stopped doing, I feel that I am not like the other worshippers and I envy them for their faith. I also feel put off by religion and often I cannot listen to the Quran or Hadith (prophetic narrations), or listen to tapes, except with great difficulty. 
This is tormenting me because I do not want this, and I want to be like I was, a believer who loves the religion because it is the truth, but I feel that I cannot control my mind or my feelings. I have started to think about my sins which I believe are the cause of this, and I have started to remember many sins which I had forgotten, as if they are appearing before me one after the other.
Until now I am living with this torment, misery and distress. I do not know what has happened to me and what the solution and the remedy is. Will my faith come back to me or is this a bad end and a punishment from Allah? 
Finally, please do not forget to make Du`a (supplication) for me.","If you are losing faith in Islam, you need to increase your hope and trust in Allah. You should increase your good deeds, such as reading the Quran, giving charity, remembering Allah (Dhikr), upholding the ties of kinship, etc.",,"Praise be to Allah.My brother, have great hope in Allah, and do not let the devil cause you to despair of the vast mercy of Allah which He has guaranteed for His believing slaves. What you are telling yourself about this being a sign that you will die following something other than that which Allah wants is only insinuating whispers (Waswas ) from the devil and his deviant ideas by means of which he wants to tempt the slaves of Allah and lead them away from their religion. 
So he comes to a righteous slave and whispers to him that his good deeds are of no avail, or that he is doing them not for the sake of Allah but to show off to people, so that they will think he is good.
 All of these are the usual ways with which the devil tries to trick the slaves of Allah, especially those who show signs of being righteous – of whom I think that you are one, although I do not praise anyone before Allah – to hinder their efforts. We seek refuge with Allah from him. 
You need to increase your hope and trust in Allah Who forgives all sins, and who accepts the slave who seeks His protection and refuge, for He is the Most Merciful, the Oft-Forgiving and the Most Loving.  
You should increase your good deeds , such as reading the Quran, giving charity , remembering Allah (Dhikr ), upholding the ties of kinship, etc. 
The weakness which you feel also happens to others, for it is something natural. How many people were examples followed by others and had a great deal of drive and ambition, then they lost their drive and ambition for a long time, then it came back to them by the grace of Allah. 
Remember the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Everybody has his time of energy, and every time of energy is followed by a time of lethargy. But if a person tries to follow a moderate path, then I have hope for him, but if he becomes one who is pointed out (in the street), then do not think anything of him.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 2453; classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi, 1995) 
What is meant by “Everybody has his time of energy” is eagerness for a thing, energy and the desire to do good.
What is meant by “every time of energy is followed by a time of lethargy” is tiredness, weakness and lack of movement.
“But if a person tries to follow a moderate path” means that the one who has energy does his deeds in moderation and avoids going to extremes when he is feeling energetic and avoids being negligent when he is feeling lethargic.
“Then I have hope for him” means, I have hope that he will be successful, for he can continue following a middle course, and the most beloved deeds to Allah are those which are continuous.
“but if he becomes one who is pointed out (in the street)” means, if he strives hard and goes to extremes in doing good deeds so that he will become famous for his worship and asceticism, and he becomes famous and people point him out to one another,
“then do not think anything of him” means, do not think that he is one of the righteous, because he is showing off. He did not say, “do not have hope for him,” as an indication that he has already fallen, and he will not be able to make up for what he has missed out on. [Tuhfat Al-Ahwadhi] 
Think about this Hadith, and relate it to your own situation and the situation of others: you will see a clear similarity. This Hadith clearly states that man goes through a stage of incomparable eagerness and great focus and ambition, then suddenly he becomes weak and loses that focus and eagerness and ambition. When he reaches this stage, he must strive even harder to do obligatory duties and avoid prohibited things. If he does that, then there is the hope that he will succeed and progress, but if he falls into prohibited things and stops doing obligatory things, he will be lost and doomed.
So you must turn to Allah a great deal, seek His forgiveness and ask Him to make you steadfast until death. I also advise you to keep away from prohibited things. May Allah forgive your sins and make things easier for you.

22878,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22878,Our attitude towards rumours and news on the Internet,"How should we deal with the rumours that appear on the Internet? What is the Muslim’s attitude towards the news that we read here and there, and what is written in chat rooms, especially since some of it is good news for the Muslims, but the source is unknown.",,,"Praise be to Allah.We live nowadays at a time when many rumours that bring hope are appearing in the guise of news. These appears on Internet web sites and chat rooms, so that they may be spread to the people as glad tidings and so that good-hearted people may accept them as indisputable facts coming from trustworthy sources. Even if any of them could be proven, there are still many rumours that can be classed as no more than fabrications. The one who thinks about this will understand that many of the global media, including the Arab media, exaggerate in their coverage of some events and they analyze them in a subjective manner that shows a complete bias and evident absence of objectivity, trying to take revenge by adding to the news and exaggerating, and telling weird news stories. So there is no such thing as credibility in these media, especially when emotions and wishes play a part. This is apart from the fact that media objectivity has become a victim of this current war, and western circles have rejected the lessons [of objectivity, etc.] that they used to teach others. But this does not mean that we should dispute the facts or deny what is taking place in reality, or that we should face this bias with exaggeration and hopes. 
Here we should pause and remind ourselves, and the good-hearted people who hear this news and tell it to others with good intentions – and those who fabricate these rumours and take upon themselves the job of propagating them – of a few facts.  
1 – We must be certain about the news we accept, and we should not accept it simply because it happens to coincide with our hopes and wishes. We have our own methodology of verifying matters, and we should be consistent with regard to what we like and dislike. It is not right for us to doubt news accompanied by pictures from the battlefield, or to shed doubts on it, when the bottom line is one’s senses. At a time when you see news going around through mobiles from some internet web sites, there are some people who may accept such news but it should be noted that there are people who will never believe it. So they should beware of exposing themselves to being called liars. An old proverb says, “Whoever pursues weird news will be disbelieved.” 
2 – We have to be cautious about the fact that the source is anonymous. There is no information more important than that of the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), yet despite that it is not part of the Muslims’ methodology to accept reports of the Sunnah from people who are unknown. Hence news must be taken from authentic sources; if it is not authentic then it should at least be known, so that people may be able to find out for themselves whether it is authentic or not. What a bad habit it is for a man to say, “I heard” or “they said.” 
3 – If there are people who permit the fabrication of rumours, basing that on some kind of ijtihaad, we must refuse to be the means of transmitting that by believing it and propagating it. (Whoever narrates a saying knowing it to be a lie is one of the liars). 
4 – One of the reasons used by the fabricators to justify making up these rumours is that it is a kind of lying in war, which is permissible. They ignore the fact – of which they are not ignorant – that the only kind of lying that is permitted in war is that which misleads the enemy, not that which creates illusions and deceives the Muslims. 
5 – If we have lost some aspects of the battle, we must not lose truthfulness which is our capital in our dealings with others. People will be astounded and amazed if they find out that this false news was transmitted through a good man. Whoever is known to have lied or to have transmitted lies will no longer be in a position to be considered trustworthy.
 6 – Similarly the righteous will be astounded and will become suspicious of a narrator who appeared to be righteous because he was telling this news and confirming it to them. At the same time, others will express joy, those who took the opposite stance to these youngsters and said, “This is their news, this is their credibility!” Everyone who was upset by the Muslim revival will find an opportunity to generalize this mistake and accuse all the pioneers of the revival of behaving like that. Please, for Allaah’s sake, do not make the enemy rejoice or give them a reason to attack. 
7 – If truthfulness is an Islamic virtue and part of Arabic chivalry, then telling lies is an obscenity that Islam has forbidden. Even the mushrik Arabs refrained from telling lies, as Abu Sufyaan – when he was still a mushrik – said: “Were it not that I am afraid that people may find out that I had told a lie, I would have told lies about him.” That was when he was speaking to Heraclius (about the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)). He did not want to have even one lie to be found in his history, even if it was a lie told against his enemy Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to Heraclius (the Roman ruler). We are concerned that the propagation of these rumours may lead people to record a lot of lies against us. 
8 – Fabricating rumours and believing them readily is a form of escapism in the face of a reality which one dislikes and with which one does not feel comfortable.  
The soul finds consolation in denying that which it does not like and in fabricating and disseminating rumours, but in the end it will have to submit to the authority of overwhelming reality. But this psychological trick is not fit to be the means of escapism for the followers of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who taught them the virtues of truthfulness and commanded them to strive their utmost to be truthful. He said: “Truthfulness leads to righteousness and righteousness leads to Paradise. A man will continue to speak the truth and strive to be truthful, until he will be recorded with Allaah as a speaker of the truth. And lying leads to immorality and immorality leads to Hell, a man will continue to tell lies and strive in telling lies, until he will be recorded with Allaah as a liar.” 
9 – Delaying recognition of realities and veiling reality with illusions, the greatest form of which is believing and disseminating rumours, will only multiply the amount of losses, and the greatest loss will be the loss of values. The highest and most precious of those values is truthfulness. “then if they had been true to Allaah, it would have been better for them” [Muhammad 47:21 – interpretation of the meaning]
 10 – Recognizing the truth is the first step towards dealing with crises and overcoming them, but not admitting them and concealing them are among the greatest means of reinforcing them, renewing them and repeating them.
 11 – Our advice is not to transmit this news. We must advise those who transmit it with the best of intentions and present them with the real facts, we should not try to spare their feelings at the expense of our reason and the transmission of truthful news, and we should try to rescue them from the anxiety of illusion and point them in the direction of reality, because truthfulness brings peace of mind and lies bring suspicion.
 12 – Sayyid Qutub (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “The reality of a thing defeats the outward appearance of another thing, even if it is the reality of kufr.” 
How I wish that I did not have to talk in this manner, but the problem is there and must be addressed. I have tried to be truthful when speaking about truthfulness, for the dearest of speech to Allaah is that which is most sincere. 
“O you who believe! Be afraid of Allaah, and be with those who are true (in words and deeds)”
[al-Tawbah 9:119 – interpretation of the meaning]
O Allaah, show us the truth as truth and enable us to follow it; show us the false as false and enable us to avoid it. Guide us concerning disputed matters of truth by Your leave, for You guide Whomsoever You wish to the Straight Path.

    What happened to you after that may be because of the effect of those sins. We have mentioned some of those effects in our answer to question no.
    23425, which we hope you will look at. 
There are many women like you who have 
    delayed marriage, but they have not done what you did. Rather they make use of their time to memorize Qur’aan, seek knowledge and call people to 
    Allaah. This is the way in which Allaah opens hearts and puts minds at rest, and this is the way in which Allaah makes worldly matters easy for 
    those who follow it. 
Your wishing for death because you fear 
    becoming more careless and committing more sins is a great mistake. Rather you should only wish for death when you are in a better situation than 
    you are at present. It is up to you: you can take charge of yourself and go back to the way you were, and do better than that, in sha Allaah. But 
    you have to be honest with yourself and hasten to go back to the way that Allaah likes and is pleased with. 
Not everyone who wishes for death will get 
    what he wants; hence we are afraid that your situation may become even worse, which is what makes the Shaytaan happy and angers the Most Merciful. 
    You have to realize that. Your wish for death is not the solution to your problem. Rather the solution is to repent sincerely and to do that which 
    pleases Allaah, and to make up for what you have missed of actions that are pleasing to Allaah. 
Perhaps you know that what has happened to 
    you and what Allaah has decreed for you may be better for you, if you come back to Allaah, because you will regret what has happened and you will 
    do more acts of obedience and worship, and Allaah will turn the bad deeds that have been recorded against you into good deeds. This is the bounty 
    of Allaah towards His slaves. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: 
Whoever thinks that a person who has 
    committed sin and then repents will be lacking is making a great mistake, for the condemnation and punishment that may befall the sinner do not 
    affect the one who repents from sin at all. If he hastens to repent from sin then nothing will affect him, but if he delays repentance then he may 
    be affected by some condemnation and punishment during the period between committing sin and repenting.

And he said: 
But a person may do something haraam and then repent, and that is good for him if he repents 
    from it, and by repenting he may become humble and soft-hearted, and more devoted to Allaah. Sins may serve an interest if one repents from them, 
    because if a person does not commit sin he may become arrogant, filled with self-admiration and hard-hearted, but if he commits sin, that humbles 
    him and softens his heart because of his repentance.

22881,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22881,Ruling on giving everything one owns in charity,What is the ruling on giving all that one owns in charity?,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The scholars of the four madhhabs are agreed that it is 
    mustahabb for charity to be composed of whatever is surplus to one’s needs 
    and the needs of those for whom one is responsible. If a person gives in 
    charity that which affects his needs or the needs of those for whom he is 
    responsible, that is a sin, because his spending on them is obligatory and 
    it is not permissible to give precedence to a naafil (supererogatory) action 
    over an obligatory one.  

    But with regard to whatever is surplus to the needs of those 
    on whom a person is obliged to spend, the majority of scholars say that 
    holding on to whatever wealth he needs is preferable to giving it all away 
    in charity, unless he has an income or is sure that he will be able to put 
    his trust in Allaah and be patient and steadfast in bearing poverty and will 
    be able to refrain from begging. Some scholars regarded it as mustahabb to 
    give all his wealth in that case. The Shaafa’is regard this as being the 
    most correct view, and it is the apparent meaning of al-Muwaffaq’s words in
    al-Mughni. What may be understood from the Maaliki and Hanafi 
    madhhabs is that they do not regard that as mustahabb, because after 
    mentioning the above conditions concerning the permissibility of giving all 
    one's wealth in charity, they say, “There is noting wrong with that,” as if 
    the matter is permissible in their view. But some Maalikis add to that a 
    comment which may be understood as meaning that they regard it as mustahabb, 
    as they say, “The way of encouraging giving all one's wealth in charity is 
    that the donor should feel good about it after giving all his wealth and 
    should not feel regret about being without wealth or hope to gain a similar 
    amount of wealth in the future. He should not have any need of it in the 
    future for himself or for those on whom he is obliged or encouraged to 
    spend. Otherwise it is not recommended for him (to give all his wealth in 
    charity), rather it is haraam for him to do so if those on whom he is 
    obliged to spend are in certain need, or it is makrooh for him to do so if 
    he is certain that those on whom it is recommended for him to spend are in 
    need, because it is better to give in charity that which is surplus to his 
    needs and the needs of those on whom he is obliged to spend.”

From these comments it is 
    clear that the scholars did not limit charity to one third (of one's 
    wealth). The evidence from the Qur’aan and Sunnah that these scholars based 
    their views on is as follows: 

    1 – The aayah (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And let not your hand be tied (like a miser) to your 
    neck, nor stretch it forth to its utmost reach (like a spendthrift), so that 
    you become blameworthy and in severe poverty”

    [al-Isra’ 17:29]
The mufassireen said, in 
    their commentaries on this aayah: Do not give all that you have when you and 
    your dependents are in need of it, so that you are left with no money to 
    spend, like an exhausted camel, i.e., one which has lost its strength and 
    has no energy. And it was said that it means, lest you be blamed and come to 
    regret it. But the one who is being addressed here is not the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), because he is not one of those 
    who would regret spending what they had in their hands for the sake of 
    Allaah. Rather Allaah forbade extravagance in spending and giving all the 
    money that one has in hand, less that end in regret on the part of the one 
    who spent all that he had.

    (al-Mawsoo’ah 4/184) 

    2 – It was narrated that Ka’b ibn Maalik (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) said: “I said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, as a sign of my 
    repentance I will give away some of my wealth in charity to Allaah and His 
    Messenger.’ The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: ‘Keep some of your wealth for yourself, that will be better 
    for you.’” (al-Bukhaari, 2552; Muslim, 4973). 

    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    did not specify that he should give one-third in charity.

     Al-Shawkaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “The 
    hadeeth of Ka’b indicates that it is prescribed for the one who wants to 
    give all his wealth in charity to keep some of it. That does not imply that 
    if he wanted to go ahead with it, he would not be able to do so. It was said 
    that giving all one's wealth in charity varies according to one's situation. 
    If a person is strong and knows that he will be able to bear the 
    consequences with patience, then there is no reason why he should not do 
    that.  Based on that we may interpret the action of Abu Bakr al-Sideeq and 
    the way in which the Ansaar preferred others to themselves even though they 
    were in need of that [cf. al-Hashr 59:9]. But if a person is not like that, 
    then he should not do that. This is how the words “There is no charity 
    except when one has the means” should be interpreted. According to another 
    report, “The best of charity is that which is given when one has the means.”

    (al-Nayl 8/288)

     3 – It was narrated that Anas ibn Maalik (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) said: Abu Talhah was the richest man among the Ansaar in 
    Madeenah in terms of date palm trees, and the most beloved of his wealth to 
    him was the garden of Bayruha’. It was opposite the Mosque and the Messenger 
    of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to go there 
    and drink its water, which was good.”

     Anas added: “When the aayah (interpretation of the meaning) 
    –  

    ‘By no means shall you attain Al-Birr (piety, 
    righteousness — here it means Allaah’s reward, i.e. Paradise), unless you 
    spend (in Allaah’s Cause) of that which you love’

    [Aal ‘Imraan 3:92] – 

    was revealed, Abu Talhah stood up and went to the Messenger 
    of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and said: ‘O 
    Messenger of Allaah, Allaah says, “By no means 
    shall you attain Al-Birr (piety, righteousness — here it means Allaah’s 
    reward, i.e. Paradise), unless you spend (in Allaah’s Cause) of that which 
    you love…” The most beloved of my wealth to me is 
    the garden of Bayruha’, and I am giving it in charity to Allaah, hoping to 
    find reward for that with Allaah. So dispose of it, O Messenger of Allaah, 
    as Allaah shows you.’ The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Bravo! That is a good deal, that is a good deal. 
    I have heard what you said and I think that you should give it to your 
    relatives.’ Abu Talhah said, ‘I will do that, O Messenger of Allaah.’ So Abu 
    Talhah shared it out among his relatives and cousins (sons of his paternal 
    uncles).”

    (al-Bukhaari, 1368; Muslim, 1664)

     Al-Shawkaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) said (al-Nayl, 
    3/36):

     “This indicates that it is permissible to give more than one 
    third of one’s wealth in charity when one is alive and not suffering from 
    terminal illness, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) did not ask Abu Talhah how much he wanted to give in charity, but 
    he said to Sa’d ibn Abi Waqqaas when he was sick, “A third is a lot.”.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
22885,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22885,Charity given during one's lifetime is better,"Is it better for a person to give charity when he is alive, or can he write in his will that it is to be given after he dies?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The virtue of giving in charity whilst one is in good health: 
It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that a man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: “O Messenger of Allah, which charity brings a greater reward?” He said, “If you give in charity when you are healthy and miserly, fearing poverty and hoping for richness. Do not delay until you are at the point of death and you say, ‘Give this to So and so, give this to So and so,’ …” (al-Bukhaari, 1330; Muslim, 1713). 
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Al-Khattaabi said: what this hadeeth means is that miserliness is more likely when one is in good health, so if a person is miserly but he still gives in charity, his intention is more sincere and his reward will be greater, unlike the one who is facing death and no longer has any hope of living. Then he starts to realize that someone else will take his wealth, so his charity in this case is lacking, when compared with charity given when one is in good health. Stinginess is based on the hope of remaining alive and fear of poverty… so a person does not have as much reward for his will, compared to the reward for charity given by one who is healthy and miserly.” 
Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The hadeeth indicates that paying off debts and giving in charity during one's lifetime when one is in good health is better than doing so after death or when one is sick. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) referred to that when he said: ‘When you are in good health and being cautious, hoping to be rich…’ because when a person is in good health it is usually harder for him to give money, because the Shaytaan makes him fear for it and makes attractive to him the idea that he may live a long life and need that money, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
‘Shaytaan (Satan) threatens you with poverty’[al-Baqarah 2:268]
The Shaytaan may also make attractive the idea of being unfair in one's will or revoking it altogether. 
Some of the Salaf said of some wealthy people: “They disobey Allah with regard to their wealth twice, by being stingy with it when it is in their hands – i.e., during their lifetime, and by being extravagant with it when it is no longer in their hands – i.e., after death.” Al-Tirmidhi narrated with a hasan isnaad, which was classed as saheeh by Ibn Hibbaan, that Abu’l-Dardaa’ said in a marfoo’ report: “The likeness of the one who frees slaves and gives in charity when he is dying is that of a person who gives his food away after he has eaten his fill.” This is similar to the hadeeth quoted above. 
Abu Dawood narrated a marfoo’ hadeeth from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri, which was classed as saheeh by Ibn Hibbaan, which says: “If a man were to give one dirham in charity when he is alive and in good health, that is better for him than giving one hundred when he is dying.”.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

When to give to zakat al-fitr


Can zakat al-fitr be given in cash?","Praise be to Allah.The rate of zakat al-fitr
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoined Zakat al-Fitr upon the Muslims at a rate of one sa` of dates or one sa` of barley, and he commanded that it should be given before the people went out to pray – i.e., the ‘Eid prayers. 
In al-Sahihayn, it is narrated that Abu Sa’id al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “At the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) we used to give Zakat al-Fitr at a rate of one sa` of food, or one sa` of dates, or one sa` of barley, or one sa` of cheese, or one sa` of raisins…” 
A number of scholars interpreted the word food in this hadith as referring to wheat, and others explained it as referring to the staple food of the local people, no matter what it is, whether it is wheat, corn or something else. This is the correct view, because the zakah is a kind of help given by the rich to the poor, and the Muslim should not offer help with anything other than the staple food of his country. 
What must be given is a sa` of all kinds of food, which is four times the amount scooped up with two hands, which is approximately three kilograms. If the Muslim gives a sa` of rice or some other staple food of his country, that is fine. 
When to give to zakat al-fitr
Zakat al-Fitr first becomes due on the night of the twenty-eighth of Ramadan , because the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to give it one or two days before ‘Eid, and the month lasts twenty-nine or thirty days. 
The latest it may be given is at the ‘Eid prayer, but it is not permissible to delay it until after the prayer, because of the report narrated by Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever gives it before the prayer, it is accepted zakah, and whoever gives it after the prayer, it is a kind of charity.” (Abu Dawud) 
Can zakat al-fitr be given in cash?
It is not permissible to pay the value of zakat al-Fitr in money , according to the majority of scholars, and the evidence for this view is more sound. Rather it should be given in the form of food, as was done by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) and the majority of the ummah. 
We ask Allah to help us and all the Muslims to understand His religion and adhere steadfastly to it. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad and his family and Companions.

    correct scholarly view is that offering the funeral prayer in absentia is 
    not prescribed except when the funeral prayer has not been offered for the 
    deceased, such as when a person dies in a kaafir land and no one offers the 
    funeral prayer for him, because it is obligatory to offer the funeral 
    prayer. As for those for whom the funeral prayer has been offered, the 
    correct view is that it is not prescribed to offer the funeral prayer for 
    them, i.e., in absentia, because that was not narrated in the Sunnah except 
    in the case of the Negus (the ruler of Abyssinia), because the funeral 
    prayer was not offered for the Negus in his own country. Hence the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) offered the funeral prayer 
    for him in Madeenah. Other great men and leaders died but there is no report

    Some of the scholars said: Whoever has benefited Islam by 
    means of his wealth or knowledge, the funeral prayer may be offered for him

Fitnah from a linguistic point of view


Meaning of fitnah in the Quran","Praise be to Allah.Definition of fitnah 
Fitnah from a linguistic point of view
Al-Azhari said: 
“The Arabic word fitnah includes meanings of testing and trial. The root is taken from the phrase fatantu al-fiddah wa’l-dhahab (I assayed (tested the quality of) the silver and gold), meaning I melted the metals to separate the bad from the good. Similarly, Allah says in the Quran (interpretation of the meaning): ‘(It will be) a Day when they will be tried [yuftanuna] (punished, i.e. burnt) over the Fire!’ [al-Dhariyat 51:13], meaning, burning them with fire.” (Tahdhib al-Lughah, 14/196). 
Ibn Faris said: 
“Fa-ta-na is a sound root which indicates testing or trial.” (Maqayis al-Lughah, 4/472). 
This is the basic meaning of the word fitnah in Arabic. 
Ibn al-Athir said: 
“Fitnah: trial or test… The word is often used to describe tests in which something disliked is eliminated. Later it was also often used in the sense of sin, kufr (disbelief), fighting, burning, removing and diverting.” (al-Nihayah, 3/410. Ibn Hajar said something similar in al-Fath, 13/3) 
Ibn al-’Arabi summed up the meanings of fitnah when he said: 
“Fitnah means testing, fitnah means trial, fitnah means wealth, fitnah means children, fitnah means kufr, fitnah means differences of opinion among people, fitnah means burning with fire.” (Lisan al-‘Arab by Ibn Manzur). 
Meaning of fitnah in the Quran
·        Testing and trial , as in the verse (interpretation of the meaning):
“Do people think that they will be left alone because they say: ‘We believe, and will not be tested [la yuftanun].” [al-'Ankabut 29:2]
i.e., that they will not be subjected to trial, as Ibn Jarir said. 
·        Blocking the way and turning people away, as in the ayah (interpretation of the meaning):
“but beware of them lest they turn you [yaftinuka] (O Muhammad) far away from some of that which Allah has sent down to you.” [al-Maidah 5:49]
Al-Qurtubi said: “This means blocking your way and turning you away.”
·        Persecution, as in the verse (interpretation of the meaning):
“Then, verily, your Lord for those who emigrated after they had been put to trials [futinu] and thereafter strove hard and fought (for the Cause of Allah) and were patient, verily, your Lord afterward is, Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [al-Nahl 16:110]
Put to trial means persecuted. 
·        Shirk and kufr, as in the verse (interpretation of the meaning):
“And fight them until there is no more Fitnah (disbelief and worshipping of others along with Allah).” [al-Baqarah 2:193]
Ibn Kathir said: “This means shirk (worshipping others besides Allah). 
·        Falling into sin and hypocrisy , as in the verse (interpretation of the meaning):
“(The hypocrites) will call the believers: “Were we not with you?” The believers will reply: “Yes! But you led yourselves into temptations [fatantum anfusakum], you looked forward for our destruction; you doubted (in Faith) and you were deceived by false desires.” [al-Hadid 57:14]
Al-Baghawi said: “I.e., you made yourselves fall into hypocrisy and you destroyed yourselves by means of sin and whims and desires.”
·        Confusing truth with falsehood, as in the verse (interpretation of the meaning):
“And those who disbelieve are allies of one another, (and) if you (Muslims of the whole world collectively) do not do so [i.e. become allies, as one united block under one Khalifah (a chief Muslim ruler for the whole Muslim world) to make victorious Allah’s religion of Islamic Monotheism], there will be Fitnah (wars, battles, polytheism) and oppression on the earth, and a great mischief and corruption (appearance of polytheism).” [al-Anfal 6:73]
What this means is that “unless believers are taken as close friends instead of disbelievers, even if they are relatives, there will be fitnah on earth, i.e., truth will be confused with falsehood.” This is how it is explained in Jami’ al-Bayan by Ibn Jarir.
·        Misguidance , as in the ayah (interpretation of the meaning):
“And whomsoever Allah wants to put in Al-Fitnah (error, because of his rejecting of Faith), you can do nothing for him against Allah.” [al-Maidah 5:41]
The meaning of fitnah here is misguidance. (Al-Bahr al-Muhit by Abu Hayyan, 4/262)
·        Killing and taking prisoners, as in the verse (interpretation of the meaning):
“if you fear that the disbelievers may put you in trial [yaftinakum] (attack you).”
[al-Nisa 4:101]
This refers to the disbelievers attacking the Muslims whilst they are praying and prostrating, in order to kill them or take them prisoner, as stated by Ibn Jarir. 
·        Difference among people and lack of agreement, as in the verse (interpretation of the meaning):
“and they would have hurried about in your midst (spreading corruption) and sowing sedition among you [yabghunakum al-fitnah].” [al-Tawbah 9:47]
i.e., they would have stirred up differences amongst you, as it says in al-Kashshaf, 2/277. 
·        Insanity, as in the verse (interpretation of the meaning):
“Which of you is afflicted with madness (maftun)” [al-Qalam 68:6] Here it means madness.
·        Burning with fire, as in the verse (interpretation of the meaning):
“Verily, those who put into trial [fatanu] the believing men and believing women (by torturing them and burning them).” [al-Buruj 85:10]
Ibn Hajar said: the meaning may be understood from the context. (al-Fath 11/176) 
Note: 
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: With regard to the “fitnah” which Allah attributes to Himself or which His Messenger attributes to Him, as in the verse (interpretation of the meaning), ‘Thus We have tried [fatanna] some of them with others’ [al-An’am 6:53] and the words of Musa, ‘It is only Your trial [fitnatuka] by which You lead astray whom You will’ [al-A’raf 7:155 – interpretation of the meaning], that carries a different meaning, which is a test or trial from Allah to His slaves by means of good things and bad, blessings and calamities. This is one thing; the fitnah of the mushrikin is another thing; the fitnah or trial of the believer by means of his wealth, children and neighbour is another thing; the fitnah (tribulation, differences) that happen amongst the Muslims, like the fitnah that happened between the supporters of ‘Ali and Mu’awiyah, and between him and the people of the camel, and between Muslims when they fight one another or boycott one another, is another thing.
