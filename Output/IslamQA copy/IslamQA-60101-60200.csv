Can Muslim women wear pants?


Can Muslim women wear pants under a Jilbab?","Praise be to Allah.Islamic dress code for females
The clothing in which a woman appears before non-Mahram men must meet eight conditions: 

It should cover the entire body , including the face and hands. 
It must be wide and loose , not showing the size of her limbs or the shape of her body.
It should not be thin, showing the colour of her skin.
It should not be an adornment in and of itself, such as clothing decorated with embroidery.
It should not be perfumed.
It should not resemble the clothing of men.
It should not resemble the dress of disbelieving women.
It should not be a dress of fame and vanity. (See Adab Az-Zifaf by Shaykh Al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him), p. 177; Hijab Al-Mar’ah Al-Muslimah, p. 16-111; ‘Awdat Al-Hijab, 3/145-163) 

Can Muslim women wear pants?
Based on this, a woman should not appear in front of men wearing pants or trousers because:

They show the shape of the woman’s legs
Wearing them is an imitation of men 

Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
“I think that the Muslims should not follow these fashions and kinds of clothes that come to us from here and there. Many of them are not in accordance with proper Islamic dress which involves covering the woman completely, like the short or very tight or thin clothes. That includes pants, because they show the size of a woman’s legs, as well as her stomach, waist, breasts, etc. Wearing it comes under the description given in the authentic Hadith: “there are two types of the people of Hell whom I have not seen: people with whips like the tails of cattle, with which they strike the people, and women who are clothed yet naked, walking with an enticing gait, with something on their heads that looks like the humps of camels, leaning to one side. They will never enter Paradise or even smell its fragrance, although its fragrance can be detected from such and such a distance.”  This Hadith was narrated by Muslim, 2128.” (Majmu` Faaawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin) 
Can Muslim women wear pants under a Jilbab?
With regard to wearing pants under a Jilbab, there is nothing wrong with that, rather it is more covering and more protective, if the Jilbab is wide and concealing and does not have any splits that show what is underneath it. 
Shaykh `Abd Ar-Razzaq `Afifi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“If a woman wears pants and puts over them a wide garment then she will not be resembling men, so long as she wears them underneath her garments.” (Fatawa Ash-Shaykh`Abd Ar-Razzaq `Afifi, p. 573) 
The basic principle is that the woman’s Jilbab should be wide and cover the tops of her feet, because of the report narrated by At-Tirmidhi (1731), An-Nasa’i (5336), Abu Dawud (4117) and Ibn Majah (3580) from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever lets his garment drag out of pride, Allah will not look at him on the Day of Resurrection.” Umm Salamah said: “What should women do with their hems?” He said: “Let them down by a handspan.” She said: “But then their feet will be uncovered.” He said: “Then a cubit, but no more than that.” This Hadith was classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Sunan At-Tirmidhi. 
Al-Baji (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“The words of Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) regarding lengthening the hem by a hand span – “But then their feet will be uncovered” – show that this length was not sufficient to cover them, because the movement of her feet when walking quickly, combined with the shortness of the hem, would lead to them being uncovered. When she pointed that out to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), he said: “Then a cubit, but no more than that.”” (Al-Muntaqa)
Shaykh Salih Al-Fawzan (may Allah preserve him) was asked: Is it recommended or mandatory for a woman to make her dress long? Is wearing socks on the feet sufficient if the dress is shortened only so much that nothing of the calf shows? How should a woman lengthen her dress by a cubit – below the ankle or below the knee? 
He replied: 
“What is required of the Muslim woman is to cover all her body in front of men, hence she is allowed to lengthen her garment by a cubit so as to cover her feet, whereas men are forbidden to let their garments hang below their ankles. This indicates that women are required to cover all of their bodies. If a woman wears socks that is doing something extra to be more on the safe side with regard to covering, which is something good. She should also make her garment long, as described in the Hadith. And Allah is the Source of strength.” (Al-Muntaqa min Fatawa Ash-Shaykh al-Fawzan, 5/334) 
The point is that a woman’s Jilbab should be wide and come down to her ankles or more. If it is short and comes a hand span above the ankles, that is not permissible even if she covers her calves and feet with pants or socks, because that is imitating men who are enjoined to make their garments short, above the ankles. It also shows the shape and size of her feet.

60134,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/60134,It is hard for him to go to work so he signs in as present on the days when he is absent,"I decided to take early retirement and move to the city where my family and my wife’s family live because my wife’s mother is very sick and needs to have her daughter close by. 

So I rented an apartment in that city and moved my furniture there. 

I submitted a letter of resignation to my work, but the boss advised me to delay it a little because they were going to open a branch in the city to which I was moving, or they were thinking of offering compensation to those who wanted to retire. For two months I have only been in to work a few times, and I sign for all the days on which I am absent from work.

 My question is: is my situation and my absence from work right or not? If it is not right, what is the ruling on the past days when I signed but was not present? Should I give my salary for those two months to the administration to spend on the department, so they can buy office supplies or computer equipment that the department needs? Or should I give it in charity? What is the ruling? Or should I carry on going two days a week and signing for the other days?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    We ask Allaah to reward you with good for your desire to 
    treat your wife’s mother kindly and to bring your wife close to her family, 
    and for the travelling, moving and giving up work that you are putting up 
    with for this purpose. 

    Secondly: 

    What you have done – signing for the days when you are absent 
    from work – is undoubtedly a haraam action, because it involves lying and 
    consuming people’s wealth unlawfully. Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “O you who believe! Eat not up your property among 
    yourselves unjustly”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:29]

    And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said: “Truthfulness leads to righteousness and righteousness leads to 
    Paradise. A man will keep speaking the truth and striving to speak the truth 
    until he will be recorded with Allaah as a siddeeq (speaker of the 
    truth). Lying leads to immorality and immorality leads to Hellfire. A man 
    will keep telling lies and striving to tell lies until he is recorded with 
    Allaah as a liar.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5629; Muslim, 4719. 

    Thirdly: 

    The salary that you have taken in return for these days 
    should be given back to your workplace; it is not permissible for you to 
    keep it because it is haraam wealth. The Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) said: “Every body that is nourished with haraam food, 
    the Fire is more fitting for it.” Narrated by al-Tabaraani from Abu Bakr; 
    classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami, 4519. 

    Al-Tirmidhi (614) narrated from the hadeeth of Ka’b ibn 
    ‘Ajzah: “There is no flesh that grows from haraam food but the Fire is most 
    suited for it.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
You have no right to 
    give this money in charity, because wealth can only be given in charity when 
    its owner is unknown or it is too difficult to reach him. 

    Fourthly: 

    It is not permissible for you to carry on being absent from 
    work whilst signing in as present. You should look for a way out that will 
    not involve sin, or you should agree to take early retirement now, without 
    getting the incentive of the lump sum that you mentioned. Remember that that 
    which is with Allaah can only be attained by obeying Him, and that haraam 
    wealth erases blessings and will bring evil consqeuences in this world and 
    in the Hereafter. 

    This advice was offered by Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have 
    mercy on him) to the one who was careless about his attendance at work, and 
    was not honest in recording the times when he was present. He (may Allaah 
    have mercy on him) said: “It is a duty for every Muslim to fulfil his trusts 
    and to beware of cheating at work with regard to attendance and absence and 
    in all matters. What he must do is to record the time when he entered and 
    the time when he left, so that he will have discharged his duty. The boss 
    has to advise them sincerely and direct them to do that which is good, and 
    warn them against cheating. And Allaah is the Source of strength. End quote 
    from Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 19/356. 

    We ask Allaah to guide us and you.

60137,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/60137,Getting Rid of Witchcraft After Finding It,"We brought in a servant, and now after seven months, one day after she left the washroom, we found some hair that was tied up in an unnatural manner, wrapped around four times with a thread. The hair does not belong to anyone in the family. Then we examined her handbag and we found four more bundles of the same hair, each one wrapped around four times with a thread. What should we do with this hair? Please note that it is not the hair of the servant either.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Rolling up hair and tying it 
    with thread is one of the methods used by practitioners of witchcraft. They 
    tie up these bundles and blow onto them, reciting their false incantations. 
    Whoever finds any such thing should undo the knots and pull the bundle apart 
    whilst reciting al-mu’awwidhat (chapters of Quran seeking protection with 
    Allah). Then he should destroy it by burning it and so on. Zayd ibn Arqam 
    (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated: A Jewish man used to enter upon 
    the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who trusted him. He 
    tied some knots and placed them in a well belonging to a man from among the 
    Ansar (early inhabitants of Madinah who welcomed immigrants from Makkan). He 
    suffered because of this for several days – or, according to the hadeeth 
    (narration) of ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her), for six months – 
    then two angels came to visit him. One sat at his head and the other at his 
    feet. One of them said, “Do you know what is ailing him?” He said: “So and 
    so who used to enter upon him tied some knots for him and threw them into 
    the well of so and so, the Ansari. He should send a man to him to take the 
    bundle out, and he will find that the water has turned yellow.” Then Jibreel 
    (peace be upon him) came to him, bringing the revelation of 
    al-Mu’awwadhatayn, and he told him that a Jewish man had bewitched him and 
    that the materials used were in the well of so and so. Then he sent a man – 
    according to another isnad (chain of narration), he sent ‘Ali (may Allah be 
    pleased with him) – who found that the water had turned yellow. He took out 
    the bundle and brought it to him, and he told him to untie it and recite a 
    verse of Quran. He started to recite and untie it, and every time he untied 
    a knot, he felt a little better, until he was fully recovered.” [al-Haakim, 
    al-Nasaa’i, Ahmad, and al-Tabarani]. 

    Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah 
    have mercy on him) said: One of the remedies for witchcraft, which is also 
    one of the most effective remedies, is to try hard to find out where the 
    material has been put, whether in the ground, in the mountains, and so on. 
    If that can be found out, and it can be taken out and destroyed, the spell 
    will be broken. He also said: Efforts should be made to find out what the 
    witch has done. If he has put some hair, for example, in a certain place, or 
    put it in a comb and so on, if it is known that he has put it in a certain 
    place, it should be taken out and burned or destroyed. Then its effects will 
    be cancelled out and what the witch wanted to do will be annulled. 
    

    You should beware of this servant and try to send her back to 
    her country. The household members should also try to protect themselves by 
    reciting the dhikrs (words of remembrance) prescribed in sharee’ah (Islamic 
    law), such as the dhikrs for morning and evening, when going to sleep, when 
    entering and leaving the house, and when eating and drinking. 

    There are means of protecting 
    oneself against the dangers of witchcraft before it happens, the most 
    important and beneficial of which is protecting oneself by reciting the 
    dhikrs, du’as (supplications) and prayers for protection that are prescribed 
    in sharee’ah, such as reciting Ayat al-Kursiy (a verse in the second 
    chapter) after every obligatory prayer, after the dhikrs that are prescribed 
    after the salam (conclusion of prayer). It may also be recited when going to 
    sleep. Ayat al-Kursiy is the greatest verse in the Holy Quran, in which 
    Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Allah! La ilaha illa Huwa 
    (none has the right to be worshipped but He), Al-Hayyul-Qayyoom (the Ever 
    Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists). Neither slumber 
    nor sleep overtakes Him. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and 
    whatever is on the earth. Who is he that can intercede with Him except with 
    His Permission? He knows what happens to them (His creatures) in this world, 
    and what will happen to them in the Hereafter. And they will never encompass 
    anything of His Knowledge except that which He wills. His Kursiy extends 
    over the heavens and the earth, and He feels no fatigue in guarding and 
    preserving them. And He is the Most High, the Most Great.” [2:255] 

    One may also recite Qul Huwa 
    Allahu ahad, Qul ‘Aoodhu bi Rabb il-Falaq and Qul ‘a’oodhu bi Rabb il-nas 
    (i.e., the last three chapters of the Quran) following every obligatory 
    prayer, and recite these three chapters three times at the beginning of the 
    day, after Fajr (early morning) prayer, and at the beginning of the night, 
    after Maghrib (sunset). 

    Another dhikr is to recite 
    the last two verses of Surat al-Baqarah at the beginning of the night. In 
    these verses Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “The Messenger (Muhammad) 
    believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and (so do) the 
    believers. Each one believes in Allah, His Angels, His Books, and His 
    Messengers. (They say,) “We make no distinction between one another of His 
    Messengers” — and they say, “We hear, and we obey. (We seek) Your 
    forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the return (of all).”

    Allah burdens not a person 
    beyond his scope. He gets reward for that (good) which he has earned, and he 
    is punished for that (evil) which he has earned. “Our Lord! Punish us not if 
    we forget or fall into error, our Lord! Lay not on us a burden like that 
    which You did lay on those before us (Jews and Christians); our Lord! Put 
    not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear. Pardon us and 
    grant us forgiveness. Have mercy on us. You are our Mawla (Patron, Supporter 
    and Protector) and give us victory over the disbelieving people.” 
    [2:285-286]

    It is narrated in a saheeh 
    (authentic) report that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah 
    be upon him) said: “Whoever recites Ayat al-Kursiy at night will have 
    protectors from Allah and no devil will come near him until morning comes.” 
    And it is reported in a saheeh report that he (peace and blessings of Allah 
    be upon him) also said: “Whoever recites the last two verses of Surat 
    al-Baqarah at night, that will suffice him.” The meaning – and Allah knows 
    best – is that they will suffice him against all evil. 

    You should also frequently 
    recite duas seeking refuge in the perfect words of Allah from the evil of 
    that which He has created”, night and day, when stopping in any place in the 
    city or in the desert, by air or by sea, because the Prophet (peace and 
    blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever makes a stop then says: 
    ‘A’oodhu bi kalimat Allah il-tammati min sharri ma khalaq (I seek refuge in 
    the perfect words of Allah from the evil of that which He has created),’ 
    nothing will harm him until he moves on from that place.” 

    At the beginning of the day 
    and at the beginning of the night, the Muslim should say three times: 
    “Bismillah illathi la yadurru ma’a ismihi shay’un fi’l-ard wa la fi’l-sama’ 
    wa huwa al-samee’ ul-‘aleem (In the name of Allah with Whose name nothing is 
    harmed on earth nor in heaven, and He is the All-Hearing, All-Knowing)” 
    because it is narrated in a saheeh report that the Messenger of Allah (peace 
    and blessings of Allah be upon him) encouraged that, and that is a means a 
    protection against all evil. 

    These dhikrs and prayers for 
    protection are among the greatest means of protecting oneself against the 
    evils of witchcraft and other evils, for the one who recites them regularly 
    and with sincerity, faith and trust in Allah, depending on Him and keeping 
    their minds and hearts open to what the evidence says. They are also one of 
    the greatest weapons for removing the effects of witchcraft once it has 
    taken place; as well as that one should beseech Allah a great deal and ask 
    Him to relieve the harm. 

    Another du’a that has been 
    narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) for 
    treating sickness caused by witchcraft and other things, and which the 
    Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used as a ruqyah 
    (incantation) to treat his companions, is: “Allahumma Rabb al-Nas, adhhib 
    al-bas washfi, anta al-Shafiy, la shifa a illa shifa uka, shifa an la 
    yughadiru saqaman (O Allah, Lord of mankind, remove the evil and grant 
    healing, for You are the Healer. There is no healing except Your healing, 
    which does not leave any sickness).” This should be recited three times. 

    And there is the ruqyah with 
    which Jibreel (peace be upon him) treated the Prophet (peace and blessings 
    of Allah be upon him): “Bismillah urqeek, min kulli shay in yu dheek, wa min 
    sharri kulli nafsin aw ‘aynin hasidin Alaah yushfeek, bismillah urqeek (In 
    the name of Allah I perform ruqyah for you, from everything that is harming 
    you, from the evil of every soul or envious eye may Allah heal you, in the 
    name of Allah I perform ruqyah for you).” This should also be repeated three 
    times.

    Your father’s paternal uncle is regarded as an uncle to you

    permissible for her to uncover her face in front of him, or for him to be 
    alone with her, even if he is elderly, because of the general meaning of the

    young and old. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):

    women of the believers to draw their cloaks (veils) all over their bodies

    After researching the matter, 
    we could not find any evidence or report which indicates that there is any 
    special virtue for one who dies as a result of witchcraft, except that if 
    the victim of witchcraft bears this calamity with patience, he will have the 
    reward of those who are patient, and what a great reward that is. Allah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Only those who are patient 
    shall receive their reward in full, without reckoning.”
    [39:10] 

    “And certainly, We shall test

    The Prophet (peace and

    greater trial. When Allah loves a people He tests them; whoever accepts that 
    will earn divine pleasure and whoever is discontent with that will earn 
    divine wrath.” [al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Maajah]

    And he (peace and blessings 
    of Allah be upon him) said: “Calamities will continue to befall the 
    believing man and woman in regard to themselves, their children and their 
    wealth, until they meet Allah with no sins on them.” [al-Tirmidhi]

    Al-Bukhari and Muslim 
    narrated that ‘Ata ibn Abi Rabah said: Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with

    Paradise?” I said, “Yes.” He said: “This black woman came to the Prophet

    and I become uncovered. Pray to Allah for me.’ He said, ‘If you wish, you 
    may bear it with patience and Paradise will be yours, or if you wish I will 
    pray to Allah to heal you.’ She said, ‘I will be patient.’ Then she said, 
    ‘But I become uncovered; pray to Allah for me that I will not become 
    uncovered.’ So he prayed for her.” 

    It should be noted that 
    witchcraft is something real, and it may lead to the victim becoming sick, 
    and may even kill him. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may 
    Allah have mercy on him) said: In sharee’ah (Islamic law), witchcraft is 
    divided into two kinds: 

    1 – Spells and incantations, 
    i.e., recitations and unclear words by means of which the practitioner of 
    witchcraft is able to use the devils to do what he wants of harming his 
    victim. But Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “… but they could not thus 
    harm anyone except by Allah’s Leave.” [2:102] 

    2 – Medicines and potions that affect the body, mind, will 
    and inclinations of the victim, so that he turns away from a person or 
    inclines towards him or her.   

    So they make a man incline 
    towards his wife or towards another woman, so that he becomes like a dumb 
    beast that she can lead wherever she wants. Or they make the opposite 
    happen. 

    They affect the victim 
    physically by weakening him little by little, until he dies. 

    Or they make him imagine 
    things to be other than they really are. 

    Their effect on his mind may 
    go so far as to make him insane – Allah forbid. 

    End quote from Sharh Kitab 
    al-Tawheed, 2/5. 

    The victim may attain the 
    reward of the martyr, if the witchcraft leads to him suffering a stomach 
    disease, the plague or pleurisy, or it leads to a woman dying in pregnancy. 
    Ahmad, Abu Dawood  and al-Nasa’i  narrated that the Prophet (peace and 
    blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “What do you think martyrdom is?” They 
    said: “Being killed for the sake of Allah.” The Messenger of Allah (peace 
    and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Martyrdom is seven things besides 
    being killed for the sake of Allah: the one who dies of the plague is a 
    martyr; the one who dies by drowning is a martyr; the one who dies of 
    pleurisy is a martyr; the one who dies of a stomach disease is a martyr; the 
    one who dies by burning is a martyr; the one who dies beneath a collapsed 
    wall or building is a martyr; and the woman who dies in pregnancy is a 
    martyr.” 

    It says in ‘Awn al-M’abood:

60162,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/60162,Is it permissible for him to open a business offering treatment with ruqyah and cupping?,"I am a young Muslim man who is among those who call people to the way of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah. Three years ago I started to recite ruqyahs that are prescribed in sharee’ah for people, according to proper guidelines but not in any organized fashion, in return for money which I use on some of my needs. Allaah decreed that my ruqyahs be accepted and Allaah has healed many people at my hands and guided others to the right path and helped them to believe in His Oneness and to keep away from shirk, despite the hassles that I have faced from some of the charlatans, biased people and those who seek to prevent shar’i ruqyah which they describe as bid’ah and haraam earnings. Too many people started coming to me and urging to help them because there are no people who devote their time to reciting ruqyah. All of these people are coming to me for ruqyah in my home which is very humble, which causes me a lot of hardship and difficulty, and it bothers my family because people knock at the door so much, and I have started to neglect my other duties because of reciting ruqyah for them because I feel too shy to refuse. I thought of renting a place which I can use specifically for reciting ruqyah as prescribed in sharee’ah and cupping in return for approximately 20 riyals for doing ruqyah for one person, and that charge will go towards paying the rent and some of my essential needs. But I was surprised when some Muslims who claim to have knowledge denounced me for specializing in this and said that specializing in this was a bid’ah and was not known among the salaf of this ummah, and that money earned in this way is haraam. 

It is permissible to open a clinic for ruqyahs that are prescribed in sharee’ah and cupping in return for money, especially since I am in need and am not well off, and I have responsibilities towards my family, and I am suffering from a chronic illness and cannot do heavy work, and the Muslims are in need of someone who can specialize in ruqyah and call them to Tawheed and forbid them from shirk? 

If it is permissible to open a Qur’aanic clinic, then after that I find a job, there are further questions to be answered: 

1-  Should I stop doing ruqyah and take this job even though this would result in several negative consequences such as not being able to do this good deed and this will create a vacuum in this area?

2-  Should I combine both and try to reconcile between them without letting one of them affect the other?

3-  Should I refuse to work and be content with doing ruqyah because it benefits others and serves the interests of the Muslims? 

If it is not permissible to open a Qur’aanic clinic: 

1-   Should I stop doing ruqyah altogether?

2-   Is it better to carry on doing ruqyah in my house and not specialize in it, and put up with people’s annoyances?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    If the situation is as described, that you recite ruqyahs 
    that are prescribed in sharee’ah and the people really need that, then we 
    ask Allaah to reward you and help you and guide you. There is nothing wrong 
    with you receiving payment in return for that. 

    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: We 
    heard of some people who treat others by means of the Qur’aan; they recite 
    Qur’aan and du’aa’s that are prescribed in sharee’ah over water or olive oil 
    as a remedy for witchcraft, the evil eye and madness (the touch of the 
    shaytaan), and they receive payment for that. Is this permissible according 
    to sharee’ah? Does reciting over water or olive oil come under the same 
    ruling as reciting over the sick person himself? 

    He replied: 

    There is nothing wrong with receiving payment for reciting 
    ruqyah for one who is sick, because it is proven in al-Saheehayn that 
    a group of the Companions of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) set out on a journey and travelled until they made came near 
    one of the Arab tribes. (These people were either kaafirs or very stingy, as 
    Ibn al-Qayyim mentioned in al-Madaarij). They asked them for hospitality but 
    they refused to do so. Then the leader of that tribe was stung, and they 
    tried everything but nothing helped him. Then some of them said, Why don’t 
    you go to those people who are staying (nearby)? Maybe some of them have 
    something. So they went to them and said, O people, our leader has been 
    stung and we have tried everything and nothing helped him. Do any of you 
    have something? One of them said, Yes, by Allaah. I will perform ruqyah for 
    him, but by Allaah we asked you for hospitality and you did not give us 
    anything, so we will not perform ruqyah for you unless you give us something 
    in return. So they agreed on a flock of sheep, then he started to blow on 
    him and recite Al-hamdu Lillaahi Rabb il-‘Aalameen. Then he recovered 
    quickly from his complaint and started walking, and there was nothing wrong 
    with him. Then they have them what they had agreed to, and some of them (the 
    Sahaabah) said, Let us share it out. The one who had performed ruqyah said, 
    Do not do anything until we come to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) and tell him what happened, and we will wait and see 
    what he tells us to do. So they came to the Messenger of Allaah  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and told him what had happened. He 
    said, “How did you know that it is a ruqyah?” Then he said, “You did the 
    right thing.” 

    Narrated by al-Bukhaari (2115) and Muslim(4080). 

    There is nothing wrong with reciting over water or olive oil 
    to treat the sick person, the one on whom a spell has been cast or the one 
    who is insane, but reciting over the patient and blowing over him is better 
    and preferable. Abu Dawood (may Allaah have mercy on him) narrated with a 
    hasan isnaad that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) recited over water for Thaabit ibn Qays ibn Shammaas and poured it over 
    him. And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “There is nothing wrong with ruqyah that does not involve shirk.” Muslim 
    (4079). This saheeh hadeeth is general in meaning and includes ruqyah 
    recited over the patient himself and ruqyah recited over water and olive oil 
    etc. And Allaah is the Source of strength. End quote. 

    Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn Baaz 
    (19/338). 

    The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked about a man 
    who performed ruqyah for people in return for payment, and he did not know 
    anything but that which was proven from the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him), and he referred to the books of 
    trustworthy scholars concerning that. 

    They replied: 

    If the situation is as you describe and you treat the sick 
    with ruqyahs that are prescribed in sharee’ah, and you do not recite any 
    ruqyahs except those that are proven from the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him), and you are keen to refer concerning that 
    to that which was stated by the great scholar Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have 
    mercy on him) in his well known books, and what was written by the great 
    scholar Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) in Zaad 
    al-Ma’aad and other similar books by Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah, then 
    you work is permissible, and your efforts are appreciated and will be 
    rewarded in sha Allaah. And there is nothing wrong with you receiving 
    payment for that, because of the hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allaah 
    be pleased with him) to which you referred in your question. End quote. 

    The hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri is the hadeeth mentioned 
    above, about reciting al-Faatihah as a ruqyah for the man who had been stung 
    by a scorpion. 

    As ruqyah is permissible and it is permissible to receive 
    payment for it, it makes no difference whether that is in your home or in a 
    rented place, or in separate premises, so as to ward off hardship for the 
    family at home. There is no basis for those who object to that on the 
    grounds that it is not known that the salaf earned a living in this manner; 
    once it is proven that job is permissible and that being paid for it is 
    permissible, the view that this profession is haraam is the view of one who 
    speaks without knowledge. 

    Al-Bukhaari said in his Saheeh in Kitaab al-Ijaarah 
    (the Book of Employment): Chapter on what is given for reciting the Opening 
    of the Book (al-Faatihah) as a ruqyah for an Arab tribe. Ibn ‘Abbaas 
    narrated from the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): 
    “The most deserving thing for which you receive payment is the Book of 
    Allaah.” End quote. 

    Secondly: 

    In the answer to question no. 
    71303 we stated that there is a 
    difference of scholarly opinion with regard to receiving payment for 
    cupping. The correct view is that it is permissible and is not haraam. The 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) only disallowed it 
    in the sense of it being makrooh, not haraam. 

    Thirdly: 

    There is nothing wrong with you opening a clinic to treat 
    people with ruqyah and cupping, as stated above. Even if you find other 
    work, you do not have to give up ruqyah; you could combine both types of 
    work if you think that is appropriate, without it affecting you or your 
    family. 

    If treating the sick with ruqyah offers a good opportunity to 
    call them to Allaah, advise them and direct them towards what is good – as 
    you say – then you should not give up this work, even if other work becomes 
    available to you. This is a way of doing good to others.  

    The one who offers this treatment should remember that Allaah 
    is always watching him, in secret and in public, so he should be easy going 
    with people and not press them for payment or the cost of the treatment, and 
    he should remind them that healing is in the hand of Allaah alone. He should 
    remind them to repent to Allaah and give up the sins that lead to many 
    problems and calamities.

When was Salat al-Raghaib first introduced?


Scholarly views on Salat al-Raghaib","Praise be to Allah.What is Salat al-Raghaib?
Salat al-Raghaib is one of the innovations (bid`ahs) that have been introduced in the month of Rajab. It is done on the night of the first Friday in Rajab , between Maghrib and `Isha, and is preceded by fasting on the first Thursday of Rajab. 
When was Salat al-Raghaib first introduced?
Salat al-Raghaib was first introduced in Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem) in 480 AH. There is no report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did it, or any of his Companions, or any of the best generations or imams. This alone is sufficient to prove that it is a reprehensible innovation, and it is not a praiseworthy Sunnah. 
Scholarly views on Salat al-Raghaib
The scholars have warned against it and pointed out that it is innovation and misguidance. 

Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Majmu’ (3/548) 

The prayer which is known as Salat al-Raghaib, which is twelve rak’ahs that are offered between Maghrib and ‘Isha on the night of the first Friday in Rajab, and praying one hundred rak’ahs on the night of Nisf Sha’ban (halfway through Sha’ban) are both reprehensible innovations. No one should be deceived by the fact that they are mentioned in Qut al-Qulub and Ihya ‘Ulum al-Din, or by the hadith which is quoted in these two books, because all of that is false. No one should be deceived by some of those imams who were confused about the ruling on these prayers and wrote essays stating that they are mustahabb, for they are mistaken in that. Imam Abu Muhammad ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn Isma’il al-Maqdisi wrote a valuable book showing that they are false, and he did well in that, may Allah have mercy on him.”

Al-Nawawi also said in Sharh Muslim: 

“May Allah curse the one who fabricated and introduced that, for it is a reprehensible innovation, one of the innovations which constitute misguidance and ignorance, and it involves obvious evils. A number of imams have written valuable works explaining that those who offer this prayer and the one who invented it are misguided, and they quoted a great deal of evidence to show that it is wrong and false, and that those who do it are misguided.”

Ibn ‘Abidin said in his Hashiyah (2/26): 

“It says in al-Bahr: Hence we know that it is makruh to gather for Salat al-Raghaib, which is done on the first Friday of Rajab, and that it is an innovation. 
The scholar Nur al-Din al-Maqdisi wrote a good essay on this topic which he called Rad’ al-Raghib ‘an Salat al-Raghaib, in which he covered most of the comments of earlier and later scholars among the four madhhabs.”

Ibn Hajr al-Haytami (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Is it permissible to offer Salat al-Raghaib in congregation or not? 

He replied: 
“Salat al-Raghaib is like the prayer that is known as laylat al-nusf min Sha’ban (half way through Sha’ban). These are two reprehensible innovations and the hadith which speaks of them is mawdu’ (fabricated). It is forbidden to offer these prayers either individually or in congregation.” Al-Fatawa al-Fiqhiyyah al-Kubra, 1/216 

Ibn al-Haj al-Maliki said in al-Madkhal (1/294): 

“Among the innovations that have been introduced in this noble month (i.e., Rajab) is that on the night of the first Friday thereof, they pray Salat al-Raghaib in the mosques, and they gather in some mosques and do this innovation openly in the mosques with an imam and congregation, as if it is a prescribed prayer… the view of Imam Malik (may Allah have mercy on him) is that it is makruh to do this prayer, because it was not done by those who came before, and all goodness is to be found in following them (may Allah be pleased with them).”

Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 

“As for innovating a prayer which is done regularly with a certain number of rak’ahs, with a certain recitation and at a certain time in congregation, like these prayers that are being asked about here – such as Salat al-Raghaib on the first Friday of Rajab, and halfway through Sha’ban, and the night of the twenty-seventh of Rajab, and so on – these are not prescribed in Islam, according to the consensus of the imams of Islam, as was stated by the reliable scholars. No one established such a thing but those who are ignorant and innovators. Things like this open the door to changing the laws  and rituals of Islam and becoming like those who instituted things which Allah has not ordained.” (Al-Fatawa al-Kubra, 2/239) 

Shaykh al-Islam was also asked about it and he said: 

“This prayer was not offered by the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or by any of the Sahabah or the Tabi’in or the imams of the Muslims. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not enjoin it and neither did any of the salaf or imams. They did not suggest that this night has any virtue for which it should be singled out. The hadith which is narrated concerning that from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is false and fabricated, according to scholarly consensus. Hence the scholars said that it is forbidden and not mustahabb.” (Al-Fatawa al-Kubra, 2/262) 

It says in al-Mawsu’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (22/262): 

“The Hanafis and Shafi’is stated that praying Salat al-Raghaib on the first Friday of Rajab, or on Laylat al-nusf min Sha’ban, in a specific manner or with a specific number of rak’ahs, is a reprehensible innovation. 
Abu’l-Faraj ibn al-Jawzi said: Salat al-Raghaib is a fabrication that is falsely attributed to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). They stated that these prayers are a bid’ah and are forbidden for a number of reasons. There is no report from the Sahabah, Tabi'in or imams about these two prayers. If they were prescribed in Islam then the salaf would not have been unaware of them. Rather they were introduced in the 400s (fifth century AH).”

60183,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/60183,Should he pay money in order to get a job?,"Is it permissible to pay money in order to get a government job, especially if jobs cannot usually be found except by this method?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
Government 
    jobs are regarded as a right that is shared equally among all those who are 
    qualified, based on their certificates and abilities. No preference should 
    be shown to anyone except on the basis of his suitability. Those who are in 
    charge of them should choose the most qualified and the best suited, without 
    any favouritism or bribes. 
Secondly: 
A person may 
    ask someone to intercede for him with regard to getting one of these jobs, 
    so long as he is qualified for it and that will not result in the 
    transgression of the rights of others. 
It says in
    Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (25/389): 
If the 
    intercession of someone who can help him to get a job will result in one who 
    is more qualified and has more right to it, due to greater knowledge of the 
    field and more ability to do the job correctly, being deprived of the job, 
    then such intercession is haraam, because it is wronging one who is more 
    deserving of the job, and it is wronging the bosses too, by depriving them 
    of the work of one who is more qualified and of his services and help. It is 
    also a transgression against the ummah because it deprives them of one who 
    can take care of this aspect of their affairs in the best manner. In 
    addition to that it generates resentment and suspicion and corrupts society. 
    But if this intercession will not result in any violation of people’s 
    rights, then it is permissible and even encouraged in sharee’ah, and the 
    intercessor will be rewarded for it, in sha Allaah. It is proven that the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Intercede, 
    and you will be rewarded, and Allaah will decree what He wills through the 
    lips of His Messenger.” 
    Al-Bukhaari (1342). End quote. 
Thirdly: 
With regard 
    to giving money to this intercessor, this is subject to further discussion: 
1 – If this 
    intercessor is the one who is responsible for selection of employees, or he 
    can exercise his influence and authority in that, then giving money to him 
    is a bribe and is haraam. The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) cursed the one who gives a bribe and the one who 
    takes it, and the one who mediates between them. 
Al-Bukhaari 
    (6636) and Muslim( 1832) narrated from Abu Humayd al-Saa’idi that the 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    appointed an agent (to collect the zakaah). The agent came when he had 
    finished his work and said: “O Messenger of Allaah, this is for you, and 
    this was given to me.” He said to him: “Why don’t you sit in the house of 
    your father and mother and see whether you are given anything or not?” Then 
    the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    stood up that evening after the prayer and bore witness and praised Allaah 
    as He deserves to be praised, then he said: “What is the matter with an 
    agent whom we appoint, and he comes to us and says, ‘This is for you and 
    this was given to me’? Why doesn’t he sit in the house of his father and 
    mother and see if he is given anything or not? …” 
2 – If you 
    are qualified for this job, and paying the bribe will not result in the 
    transgression of anyone’s rights, or depriving anyone who is your equal or 
    more qualified than you, and you will be deprived of your rights if you do 
    not pay this bribe, then it is permissible for you to pay it in this case, 
    in order to attain your rights, although it is haraam for the one who takes 
    it. 
This applies 
    whether the money is given to the one who is in charge of that or to someone 
    else who takes the money in return for interceding on your behalf with the 
    one who is in charge. 
Ibn Hazm 
    (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Muhalla (8/118): Bribes are 
    not permitted , i.e., that which a person gives so that he will judge 
    falsely in his favour, or appoint him to a position of authority, or wrong 
    someone for him. This is a sin on the part of the one who gives it and the 
    one who takes it. 
As for one 
    who is deprived of his rights and gives a bribe so as to ward off wrong from 
    himself, this is permissible for the one who gives it but the one who takes 
    it is sinning. End quote. 
Shaykh 
    al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: If he gives him a 
    gift so that he will refrain from wronging him or will give him his due 
    rights, this gift is haraam for the one who takes it but it is permissible 
    for the giver to give it, as the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) said: “I give one of them a gift and he goes out with it 
    carrying it like fire under his armpit.” It was said: “O Messenger of 
    Allaah, why do you give to them?” He said: “They insist on asking me and 
    Allaah insists that I should not be miserly.” For example, giving to one who 
    hid some news, or wronged people. Giving to these people is permissible for 
    the giver but it is haraam for them to take it. 
As for 
    giving gifts with regard to intercession, such as when a man intercedes with 
    the one who is in authority to relieve him of some wrong, or to give him his 
    right, or to appoint him to a position of authority that he deserves, or to 
    enlist him in a fighting force for which he is qualified, or to give him 
    some of the money that is endowed in a waqf for the poor, Qur’aan readers, 
    pilgrims and others, and he is one of those who are entitled to it, and 
    other kinds of intercession that have to do with helping people to do 
    obligatory duties or avoiding haraam things, in these cases too it is haraam 
    to accept the gift, but it is permissible for the giver to give whatever 
    will help him to attain his rights or ward off wrongdoing from himself. This 
    is what is narrated from the salaf and the senior imams. End quote from 
    al-Fataawa al-Kubra (4/174). 
Shaykh Ibn 
    ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: As for the bribe which will 
    help a man to attain his rights, such as if he cannot attain his rights 
    except by giving this money, this is haraam for the one who takes it but it 
    is not haraam for the giver, because the giver is only giving it in order to 
    attain his rights, but the taker who accepts this bribe is the sinner, 
    because he is taking what he is not entitled to. End quote from Fataawa 
    Islamiyyah (4/302).

60185,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/60185,Repenting from Taking an Interest-based Loan,"I took out a loan from the bank, due to difficult circumstances, because I wanted to prepare an apartment to get married. Please note that there is nothing luxurious in this flat at all, and it is a very simple flat. I am a teacher and my salary is transferred to the bank and a sum of money will be deducted from it each month for five years, until the loan ends. Two and a half years have passed, and I have decided to go to the bank and stop this loan, because I feel that anything that happens is because of this loan. But I found out that the amount that should be paid is more than I can afford. In addition to that, I was intending to do ‘Umrah (minor pilgrimage) this year, myself, my wife and my son and daughter. Is it permissible for me to travel for ‘Umrah, hoping that Allah will heal my sick son and then come back to stop this loan next November in sha Allah, or what should I do?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    
    It is not permissible to take out riba/interest-based loans, from the bank 
    or elsewhere, even if that is to prepare a house for marriage, because of 
    the definite prohibition on riba (interest) and the stern warning against 
    it. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    
    “O you who believe! Be afraid of Allah and give up what remains (due to you) 
    from riba (from now onwards) if you are (really) believers.

    
    And if you do not do it, then take a notice of war from Allah and His 
    Messenger but if you repent, you shall have your capital sums. Deal not 
    unjustly (by asking more than your capital sums), and you shall not be dealt 
    with unjustly (by receiving less than your capital sums).”

    
    [2:278-279] 

    
    Muslim narrated that Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The 
    Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed the one 
    who consumes riba, the one who pays it, the one who writes it down and the 
    two who witness it, and he said: “They are all the same.” 

    
    Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Every loan in which it is 
    stipulated that something extra be paid is haram (impermissible), and there 
    is no difference of opinion on this point. Ibn al-Mundhir said: They were 
    unanimously agreed that if the lender stipulates that the borrower must pay 
    extra or give him a gift, and he gives the loan on the basis that he will 
    take an additional payment for that, it is riba.  

    
    End quote from al-Mughni. 

    
    What the one who has taken out a riba-based loan has to do is repent to 
    Allah and regret what he has done, and he has to resolve firmly not to go 
    back to this great sin and serious crime, concerning which there is narrated 
    a warning such as has not been narrated concerning any other sin. We ask 
    Allah to keep us safe and sound. 

    
    Moreover, according to Islam you are not obliged to pay back any more than 
    the capital; as for the haram interest, you are not obliged to pay it and it 
    is not permissible for the lender to take it from you, because Allah says: 
    “... but if you repent, you shall have your capital sums. Deal not unjustly 
    (by asking more than your capital sums), and you shall not be dealt with 
    unjustly (by receiving less than your capital sums)”. 

    
    But if you fear harm and problems if you do not pay the interest, then pay 
    it, and repent to Allah and feel dislike towards this great evil. 

    
    Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan (may Allah preserve him) was asked: I borrowed one 
    hundred pounds from one of my friends on the basis that I would pay him back 
    one hundred and fifty. When the time to pay it back came, I tried to give 
    him one hundred only, but he insisted on taking the extra amount of fifty 
    pounds in return for the loan. What is the ruling on this extra amount? If 
    this comes under the heading of riba, is there any sin on me, and how can I 
    rid myself of it, knowing that the money that I borrowed from him has become 
    mixed with my own money. What do I have to do? 

    
    He replied: Allah has forbidden riba and has issued a stern warning against 
    it. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    
    “Those who eat riba will not stand (on the Day of Resurrection) except like 
    the standing of a person beaten by Shaytan (Satan) leading him to insanity…

    O 
    you who believe! Be afraid of Allah and give up what remains (due to you) 
    from riba (from now onwards) if you are (really) believers.

    
    And if you do not do it, then take a notice of war from Allah and His 
    Messenger.”

    
    [2:275, 278-279] 

    
    There are many forms and types of riba. What you mention in the question is 
    a loan with interest. The kind of loan that is allowed in Islam is al-qard 
    al-hasan (a goodly loan) in which you lend something to your brother so that 
    he may benefit from the loan, then he pays you back without any additional 
    payment being stipulated and without paying less. This is the goodly loan. 
    As for the loan which brings a benefit or the loan which is intended to 
    bring a payment of interest, this is haram (unlawful) according to the 
    consensus of the Muslims. It is haram according to the Quran and Sunnah 
    (prophetic teachings) and the consensus of the Muslims, and a stern warning 
    is issued to the one who does this. What should be done is to repay the 
    amount that was borrowed; as for the additional payment which has been 
    stipulated and taken from you, this is haram and is riba. 

    
    The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed the one who 
    consumes riba, the one who pays it, the two who witness it and the one who 
    writes it down. He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) also cursed 
    the one who consumes riba and the one who helps him to consume it. So what 
    you have done is haram and is a major sin, and you have to repent to Allah. 
    He has to give this interest that he took back to you, because it is not 
    permissible for him. You committed a haram action by giving him the 
    interest. What you should have done is to refrain from paying interest. 

    
    What you have done is blatant riba, so you both have to repent to Allah and 
    not do any such transaction again. The other person has to return the 
    interest that he took. And Allah knows best. End quote from al-Muntaqa min 
    Fatawa al-Shaykh al-Fawzan. 

    
    Remember that the more quickly you get rid of this loan, the better it will 
    be, so that you may rid yourself of riba and its effects. 

    
    So it is better for you to hasten to pay it off and to use the money that 
    you were going to use for ‘Umrah to rid yourself of this debt. 

    
    We ask Allah to heal your son and to relieve your distress, and make you 
    independent of means from halal (lawful) sources so that you will have no 
    need of anything haram.

60186,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/60186,Can You Wear a Baby Sling in Ihram?,What is the ruling on wearing a “sling” on one’s body to carry a baby like a kangaroo whilst performing the obligatory ‘Umrah?,"There is nothing wrong with wearing a sling to carry a baby whilst in ihram, because that is not the kind of clothing which is described in the texts as being forbidden when in ihram, nor is it like such clothing.",,"Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with wearing a sling to carry a baby whilst in ihram, because that is not the kind of clothing which is described in the texts as being forbidden when in ihram, nor is it like such clothing. 
It is more like carrying a water-skin or purse , or carrying one’s luggage on one's back tied with a rope around the chest. These things are not forbidden, as we shall see below. 
The clothes which are forbidden when in ihram are : shirts (or thobes), pants, the burnous (a wide garment with an attached hood to cover the head), turbans, and khufuf (leather slippers). 
This is indicated by the report which was narrated by al-Bukhari (5805) and Muslim (1177) from ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: A man stood up and said: “O Messenger of Allah, what do you command us to wear when we enter ihram ?” He said: “Do not wear a shirt, pants, a turban, a burnous or khufuf, unless a man does not have any sandals, in which case he may wear khufuf that come below the ankle. And do not wear any garment that has been dyed with saffron or wars (safflower).” 
That includes anything that is similar in nature, such as jubbahs and abayahs (kinds of cloak), short pants, hats and socks, and any kinds of regular clothing that is fitted to the body or part of the body. 
Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said, describing the kind of clothing that the person in ihram is not allowed to wear:
“It is clear from the hadith mentioned that what is meant by sewn clothing is that which is stitched or woven to fit the entire body, such as thobes, or the upper body, such as a sweater, or the lower body, such as pants. It also includes things that are stitched or woven to fit the hand , such as gloves, or the foot, such as khufuf.” (Majmu’ Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 17/118) 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“If a person carries a sword or a gun, that is permissible, because it is not included in that which the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stated was forbidden. If he wears a belt around his stomach, that is also permissible, and if he hangs a water bottle or purse on his belt, that is permissible. The point is that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) listed what is forbidden, and whatever is similar in nature comes under the same heading; whatever is not similar in nature does not come under that heading. If we are not sure about something, then the general principle is that it is permitted.” (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 7/152)
The sling mentioned is like what the Shaykh mentioned about carrying a water skin or carrying one’s luggage on one's back tied with a rope around the chest if necessary.  
Some scholars stated that it is permissible for a person in ihram to carry his luggage on his back and to tie it with a rope around the chest if necessary. This is very much like a sling for carrying a child. (See Minah al-Jalil Sharh Mukhtasar al-Khalil, 2/308)

If a wife is righteous in this world, what will her form or attributes be in Paradise if Allah wills that she should enter Paradise?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
Pleasing the most Merciful and entering Paradise are the ultimate aim that believing men and women should wish for. If a person departs this world having won the pleasure of Allah, then he will have the glad tidings of all that is good after that. When he enters Paradise he will have delights and pleasures such as no eye has seen, no ear has heard and it has not entered the mind of any man. He will have all that he wishes for in the best ways. Everything that he asks for will be granted, and everything that he longs for he will get. He will never find anything to upset or disturb him, because he is in the care of the Most Merciful, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Therein you shall have (all) that your inner‑selves desire, and therein you shall have (all) for which you ask.
32. An entertainment from (Allah), the Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful”
[Fussilat 41:31-32]
One of the best things that people long for in the Hereafter is, for men, the women of Paradise, namely al-hoor al-‘iyn, and for women there is an equivalent delight. By His great wisdom, Allah has not mentioned what the women will have as the equivalent of al-hoor al-‘iyn for men, and that is due to modesty and shyness. How can He encourage them to seek Paradise by mentioning something that they are too shy and modest to mention or speak about themselves? So He has simply hinted at it, as in the verse (interpretation of the meaning):
“Therein you shall have (all) that your inner‑selves desire
[Fussilat 41:31-32]
The description of al-hoor al-‘iyn is mentioned in more than one place in the Book of Allah, such as the following: 
1 – Allah says, describing the reward of the people of Paradise (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And (there will be) Hoor (fair females) with wide lovely eyes (as wives for Al-Muttaqoon – the pious).
23. Like unto preserved pearls”
[Al-Waaqi’ah 56:22, 23] 
al-Sa’di (may Allah have mercy on him)said: 
“And (there will be) Hoor (fair females) with wide lovely eyes”. Al-Hawra’ is a woman in whose eyes are lined with kohl, beautiful and bright. Al-‘iyn refers to beautiful and huge eyes. The beauty of eyes in the female is one of the greatest signs of beauty. 
“Like unto preserved pearls” means, as if they are pure, white, shining pearls, which are covered and protected from people’s eyes, the wind and the sun. Their colour is one of the most beautiful of colours and they have no fault or blemish of any kind. This is how al-hoor al-‘iyn are: they have no faults of blemishes of any kind, rather they are beautiful in all ways. 
Every time you gaze upon her, you see nothing but that which gladdens the heart. End quote.

2 – Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“(In beauty) they are like rubies and coral”
[Al-Rahmaan 55:58]
al-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
Ibn Zayd said concerning the words “they are like rubies and coral” it is as if they are rubies in their purity and like coral in their whiteness. So their purity is that of rubies and their whiteness is that of pearls. End quote. 
Tafseer al-Tabari, 27/152 
3 – Allah says describing the women of Paradise, in Soorat al-Waaqi’ah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, We have created them (maidens) of special creation.
36. And made them virgins.
37. Loving (their husbands only), (and) of equal age”
[Al-Waaqi’ah 56:35-37]
Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
With regard to the word “loving (‘uruban)”, Sa’eed ibn Jubayr said, quoting from Ibn ‘Abbas that it means: they are loving towards their husbands. It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas that al-‘urub are those who love their husbands and their husbands love them. 
With regard to the word “of equal age (atraaban)”, al-Dahhaak said, quoting from Ibn ‘Abbas, that it means: of the same age, thirty-three years.   
Al-Saddi said: “atraaban” means that they are equal in temperament and they do not resent or envy one another, i.e., they are not like hostile co-wives. End quote. 
Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 4/294 
Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said: 
It was narrated that Mujaahid said concerning the verse “Loving (their husbands only), (and) of equal age”: i.e., those who are dear to their husbands.

4 – Allah says, describing them (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Therein (Gardens) will be Khairaatun‑Hisaan [fair (wives) good and beautiful]”
[Al-Rahmaan 55:70]
Ibn al-Qayyim said: 
They are described as being fair and beautiful. The word khayraat (fair and good) is derived from the word khayyarah, which refers to the woman who combines all good qualities, both outward and inward, and whose physical appearance and attitude are perfect. So they are good in attitude and fair of face. 
Rawdat al-Muhibbeen, p. 243. 
5 – Allah describes them as pure, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and they shall have therein Azwaajun Mutahharatun(purified mates or wives), and they will abide therein forever”
[Al-Baqarah 2:25]
Ibn al-Qayyim said:
Allah describes them as pure: “and they shall have therein Azwaajun Mutahharatun(purified mates or wives)”, pure from menses, urine and the like (stools) and all off-putting features that may exist in the women of this world. And their hearts are pure from envy, annoyance of their husbands, meanness or wishing for husbands other than them. 
Rawdat al-Muhibbeen, p. 243, 244 
6 – Allah describes them as refraining from looking at anyone except their husbands (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Wherein both will be Qaasiraat‑ut‑Tarf [chaste females (wives) restraining their glances, desiring none except their husbands]”
[Al-Rahmaan 55:56] 
“Hoor (beautiful, fair females) guarded in pavilions”
[Al-Rahmaan 55:72]
Ibn al-Qayyim said: 
Allah describes them as being “guarded in pavilions”, i.e., they are prevented from making a display of themselves before anyone except their husbands. They are guarded for their husbands and they do not go out of their houses, and they restrain themselves for them and do not desire anyone else. And Allah describes them as “Qaasiraat‑ut‑Tarf [chaste females (wives) restraining their glances”. This description is more complete than the first, for one of them restrains her gaze and focuses her love upon her husband, she is content with him and does not look beyond him at anyone else. 
Rawdat al-Muhibbeen, p. 244 
This is a brief look at what has been said about them in the Quran. In the Sunnah there are descriptions of their beauty and fairness which defy the imagination, such as the following: 
1 – It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The first group will enter Paradise looking like the moon on the night when it is full, and those who follow them will be like the brightest shining star in the sky. Their hearts will be as one, and there will be no hatred or jealousy among them. Each man will have two wives from among al-hoor al-‘iyn, the marrow of whose calves can be seen from beneath the bone and flesh.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, no. 3014; Muslim, 2843. 
Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
The stunning beauty of the hoori is such that the marrow of her calves can be seen from beneath her clothes, and a man will be able to see his face in the liver of one of them, like a mirror because of the fineness of her skin and the purity of her colour. 
Fath al-Baari, 8/570 
2 – It was narrated that Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If a woman from among the people of Paradise were to look out over the earth, she would illuminate everything that is in between them, and would fill everything that is in between them with fragrance. And the scarf on her head is better than this world and everything in it.” 
If she were to show her face, it would shine between heaven and earth; how beautiful is the light of her face and how beautiful the scent that is filling the space between heaven and earth. As for her garments, the scarf that she places on her head is better than the beauty of this world and all that is in it of delights and pleasure and natural beauty and splendid palaces and other kinds of luxuries. Glory be to their Creator, how great He is, and congratulations to the one for whom she is and he is for her. 
Secondly: 
The situation of the believing woman in Paradise will be better than the situation of the hoor al-‘iyn; she will be higher in status and more beautiful. Several ahadith and reports have been narrated concerning that, but none of them can be proven to be sound. But if a righteous woman from among the people of this world enters Paradise, then she will do so as a reward for her righteous deeds and as a honour from Allah to her for her religious commitment and righteousness. As for the hoori who is one of the delights of Paradise, she has only been created in Paradise for the sake of someone else, and has been made the reward for the believing man for his righteous deeds. There is a great difference between one who enters Paradise as a reward for her righteous deeds and the one who was created as a reward for one who did righteous deeds. The former is a queen and a princess, and the latter, no matter how beautiful she is, is undoubtedly lower in status than a queen, and she is subject to the command of her believing master for whom Allah created her as a reward.  
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Does the description of the hoor al-‘iyn include the women of this world? 
He replied: 
It seems to me that the women of this world will be better than the hoor al-‘iyn, even in outward appearance, and Allah knows best.

60191,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/60191,Does the Shaytaan call the dying person to become a Jew or Christian? And what is meant by the “trials of death”?,Is it true that one of the trials of the grave involves the devils appearing in the form of one's parents and saying “We followed Judaism or Christianity and Allaah admitted us to Paradise”? Does that happen before Munkar and Nakeer come down?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.There is no evidence for 
    this from the Qur’aan or Sunnah, rather this is what some scholars say, but 
    that does not happen in the grave, rather it happens when a person is dying, 
    before the soul is taken. Some scholars stated that this comes under the 
    heading of “the trials of life”. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn 
    Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
The presenting of other 
    religions to a person at the time of death does not happen to everyone, but 
    we cannot say that it does not happen to anyone. Rather some people may not 
    have other religions presented to them, and some do have them presented to 
    them. All of that is part of the trials of life from which the Messenger 
    commanded us to seek refuge when praying. At the time of death, the Shaytaan 
    is most keen to tempt the sons of Adam. End quote from al-Ikhtiyaaraat, 
    p. 85. 
The Shaytaan remains 
    eager to tempt a person so long as his soul is still in his body, so he 
    comes to him, whispers to him and makes falsehood appear attractive to him. 
It was narrated from Abu 
    Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Iblees said: ‘By Your 
    glory, I will not stop tempting Your slaves so long as their souls are in 
    their bodies.’ [Allaah] said: ‘By My Glory and Majesty, I will continue to 
    forgive them so long as they ask Me for forgiveness.’”
Narrated by Ahmad, 10974; 
    classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Targheeb, 1617. 
The Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to seek refuge with Allaah from 
    the “trials of life and death,” and he encouraged worshippers to seek refuge 
    from them before saying the salaam at the end of the prayer. 
It was narrated that Abu 
    Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When one of you has 
    finished the final tashahhud, let him seek refuge with Allaah from four 
    things: from the torment of Hell, from the torment of the grave, from the 
    trials of life and death, and from the evil of the Dajjaal.” Narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari, 1311; Muslim, 588. 
Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih 
    al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
The words “from the trials 
    of life and death” come after the words, “from the torment of Hell.” What is 
    meant by trials (fitnah) here is the testing of a man with regard to his 
    religious commitment, during his life and after his death. The trials of 
    life are great and intense, and very few pass the test except those whom 
    Allaah wills. They revolve around two things: 

    1-Doubts

    2-Desires
As for doubts, man is faced 
    with doubts with regard to his knowledge, so he becomes confused with regard 
    to what is true and what is false, and he sees falsehood as truth and truth 
    as falsehood. If he sees truth as falsehood he will avoid it, and if he sees 
    falsehood as truth he will follow it.  
As for desires, he is faced 
    with them with regard to his will. Because of his desires, he wants 
    something that is forbidden to him. This is a serious temptation (fitnah); 
    how many are those who see riba as opportunity and indulge in it; how many 
    are those who see deceiving people as cleverness in buying and selling, and 
    indulge in deceit; how many are those who see looking at women as pleasure, 
    enjoyment and freedom, and they give free rein to their gaze; how many are 
    those who drink alcohol and it as pleasure and relaxation; how many are 
    those who watch entertainment and listen to music, regarding it as an art to 
    be studied, for which certificates and awards are to be given. 
As for the trials of death, 
    the scholars differed concerning them and there are two views: 
The first view is that the 
    “trials of death” refers to the questioning by the two angels of the 
    deceased in his grave, about his Lord, his religion and his Prophet, because 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “It has 
    been revealed to me that you will be put to trial in your graves like or 
    almost like the tribulation of the Dajjaal.” As for the one whose faith is 
    sincere, it will be easy for him to answer. 
When he is asked: Who is 
    your Lord? He will say: My Lord is Allaah. 
Who is your Prophet? He 
    will say: My Prophet is Muhammad. 
What is your religion? He 
    will say: My religion is Islam – it will be very easy for him. 
As for anyone else – Allaah 
    forbid – when he is asked he will say, Oh, oh, I do not know; I heard the 
    people saying something so I said it too. 
Think about it, how he will 
    say, “Oh, oh,” as if he used to know something but forgot it. What greater 
    loss can there be than something that you learned then forgot, because the 
    one who is ignorant does not gain anything, but the one who forgot gained 
    something and then lost it. The result will be that he will say: I do not 
    know who is my Lord, what my religion is or who my Prophet is. This is a 
    great fitnah; I ask Allaah to save me and you from it. In fact it depends on 
    what is in the heart. If the heart truly believes, and sees matters of the 
    unseen as if with the eye, then he will answer with ease, but if it is the 
    opposite, then his answer will be the opposite. 
The second view is that 
    what is meant by “the trials of death” is what happens at the time of death, 
    in the last moments of life. This was mentioned as such – even though it is 
    one of the trials of life – because of its seriousness and importance, just 
    as the fitnah of the Dajjaal is also mentioned even though it is one of the 
    trials of life, but it is also one of the trials of death because it happens 
    close to death, and it is singled out for mention because it is the worst 
    that can happen. That is because when a person is dying and bidding 
    farewell, his destiny will be either happiness or doom. The Messenger  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “One of you may do the 
    deeds of the people of Paradise until, when there is nothing between him and 
    it but a cubit, the decree overtakes him and he does a deed of the people of 
    Hell.” So the fitnah is great indeed. 
The Shaytaan is at his most 
    eager to tempt the son of Adam at this moment, and the one who is truly 
    protected is the one whom Allaah protects. He comes to him at this crucial 
    moment which no one can imagine but the one to whom it happens. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Nay, when (the soul) 
    reaches to the collarbone (i.e. up to the throat in its exit),
27. And it will be said: 
    Who can cure him (and save him from death)?
28. And he (the dying 
    person) will conclude that it was (the time) of parting (death);
29. And one leg will be 
    joined with another leg (shrouded). 
30. The drive will be on 
    that Day to your Lord (Allaah)!”
[al-Qiyaamah 75:26-30]
It is a critical situation, 
    when a person is weak, lacking in strength and willpower, feeling anxious, 
    and the shaytaan comes to him to tempt him, to such a point that it is as 
    the scholars said: he may present the Jewish, Christian and Islamic 
    religions to a person, appearing the form of his parents who present the 
    Jewish, Christian and Islamic religions to him and encourage him to follow 
    Judaism or Christianity. The Shaytaan may take on the form of anyone except 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and this is 
    the greatest of trials.  
But this – praise be to 
    Allaah – does not happen to everyone, as was stated by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn 
    Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him). Even if the Shaytaan is not able to 
    gain control over a person to such a degree, there is still fear for him. 
It was said that when Imam 
    Ahmad was dying, he could be heard saying, “Not yet, not yet.” When he came 
    to, he was asked about that and he said: The Shaytaan was biting his 
    fingertips and saying, “You got away from me, O Ahmad.” He was biting his 
    fingers out of regret that he had not deceived Imam Ahmad, and Ahmad said to 
    him, “Not yet, not yet” – i.e., the soul has not yet departed. So long as 
    the soul is in the body, anything is possible. “Our Lord! Let not our 
    hearts deviate (from the truth) after You have guided us” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:8]. 
    In this situation fitnah is great indeed. Hence the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “… from the trials of life and 
    death.” 
Conclusion: There are two 
    interpretations of what is meant by the trials of death: 

    1-It is the trials and 
    temptations that happen at the time of death.

    2-That they come after death, 
    when the two angels question a man about his Lord, his religion and his 
    Prophet.
There is no reason why 
    we should not say that it includes both. It may refer both to the trials 
    that come before death and at the time of death, because these are the 
    greatest tribulations that a man ever faces. Mention is also made of what is 
    feared of a bad end if Allaah does not save a person from this tribulation. 
Based on this, the one who 
    prays for refuge from the trials of death should bear both situations in 
    mind.

    If there are any grey hairs, then dyeing them black is 
    haraam, but if the hair is already black, there is nothing wrong with dyeing 
    it black. 

    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: 
    Some women use a mixture to condition their hair. This mixture includes 
    henna and other herbs, one of which dyes the hair black. What is the ruling 
    on using this mixture? Please note that they use it for the purpose of 
    conditioning their hair, not for the purpose of dyeing it black, because the 
    hair of some of them is black. 

    He replied: 

    There is nothing wrong with using the mixture mentioned to 
    condition the hair if the woman who is using it does not have any grey 
    hairs. But if there are any grey hairs, it is haraam to use anything that 
    will make the grey hairs black, because the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Change this grey hair, but avoid 
    black.” End quote.

    Whoever does that – whether male or female – knowingly and 
    deliberately, has fallen into sin and has to repent, seek forgiveness, 
    regret what has been done and resolve not to do it again. Part of repenting 
    completely is removing the black with something that will not cause any 
    harm. 

    But if a person was unaware of the ruling, there is no sin on 
    him, but he has to change it. He is excused for it but there is no excuse 
    for leaving it as it is. 

    An example of that is tattooing. If a person was tattooed 
    when he was young, or when he did not know that it is haraam, then he must 
    remove it when he comes to know that it is haraam, so long as removing it 
    will not cause him any harm. 

    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have 
    mercy on him) was asked: 

    What is the ruling on tattooing? If a girl was given a tattoo 
    when she was young, is there any sin on her? 

    He replied: 

    Tattooing is haraam, and is a major sin, because the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The woman who does 
    tattoos and the woman who has a tattoo done are cursed.” If a girl is given 
    a tattoo when she is young, and she cannot prevent that being done to her, 
    then there is no sin on her, rather the sin is on the one who did that to 
    her, because Allaah does not burden any soul beyond its scope, and this girl 
    had no control over the situation. But she should remove it if she is able 
    to without that causing her any harm. End quote.

    Secondly: 
With regard to the 
    ruling on removing the hair that is between the eyebrows, in the answer to 
    question no. 21400 we have quoted the scholars of the Standing Committee as 
    stating that it is not part of the eyebrows, and based on that it is 
    permissible to remove it.

60199,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/60199,He got his university certificate through an intermediary and got a job with it. What should he do?,"I was studying in one of the university faculties, but I was not able to complete my studies and I got the certificate through an intermediary, then I got a job with this certificate, and I got married by having this job, and now I have two children. 
My question is: 
What is the shar’i ruling on this – knowing that I do my job well and my boss has written a report proving my efficiency?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
Getting your certificate through an intermediary when you did not deserve it is a haraam action, which involves a number of things that are forbidden. The one who intervened for you is a partner in the haraam action. The haraam actions which resulted from you obtaining this certificate through an intermediary are as follows: 
(a)
It was intercession for an evil cause. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Whosoever intercedes for a good cause will have the reward thereof, and whosoever intercedes for an evil cause will have a share in its burden. And Allah is Ever All-Able to do (and also an All-Witness to) everything” [al-Nisa’ 4:85]
al-Haafiz ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
The reward for intercession is not general in meaning, rather it applies only to cases where the intercession is allowed, which is intercession for a good cause. That applies only to things which are allowed in sharee’ah, not to things that are not allowed, as indicated in this verse. Al-Tabari narrated with a saheeh isnaad that Mujaahid said: this applies to intercession of people for one another. To conclude, whoever intercedes for another in a good cause will have a share of the reward, and whoever intercedes for another in a false (bad) cause will have a share of the burden of sin.""(Fath al-Baari, 10/451, 451)
(b)
It was deceit, because you submitted papers that were not valid. 
It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever deceives us is not one of us.” Narrated by Muslim, 102 
(c)
You pretended to be something that you are not – by claiming that you had obtained a certificate when that was not the case. 
It was narrated from Asma’ (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The one who claims to have what he does not have is like one who wears two false garments (i.e., that do not belong to him).” 
Narrated by al-Bukhari, 4921; Muslim, 2130 
(d)
False speech and false testimony 
It was narrated that Abu Bakrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Shall I not tell you of the worst of major sins?” We said: Yes, O Messenger of Allah. He said: “Associating anything with Allah, disobeying one's parents,” and he was lying down but he sat up and said: “And false speech and false testimony, and false speech and false testimony,” and he kept saying it until we wished that he would stop (out of compassion towards him).
Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5631; Muslim, 87. 
(e)
Lying to the bosses at work and to other people. 
It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The signs of the hypocrite are three: when he speaks he lies, when he makes a promise he breaks it, and when he is entrusted with something he betrays (that trust).” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 33; Muslim, 59. 
(f)
Taking away the rights of others who had obtained genuine certificates without the intercession of anyone else. This is unjust towards those who were deprived of their right to a job. 
It was narrated from Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) narrated that Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, said: “O My slaves, I have forbidden injustice to Myself and I have made it haraam among you, so do not be unjust towards one another.”
Narrated by Muslim, 2577. 
So you can see the seriousness of what you have done, since it involves so many sins and wrong actions. What you – and the one who interceded for you – have to do is to repent sincerely, by regretting what you have done, resolving not to do it again, praying for forgiveness and doing acts of worship. 
Secondly: 
With regard to your work and the money you have earned by having this certificate, we hope that your repentance will be sufficient to solve this problem, so long as you do your work well.
