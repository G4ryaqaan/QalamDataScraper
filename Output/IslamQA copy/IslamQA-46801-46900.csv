46807,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/46807,Punishments for neglecting jihad for the sake of Allaah,Is there a specific punishment that is deserved by those who neglect jihad for the sake of Allaah?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The command to wage jihad for the sake of Allaah, and the 
    warning against neglecting jihad, appear in many verses of the Qur’aan and 
    ahaadeeth. 

    If the Muslims neglect jihad for the sake of Allaah, and 
    prefer a life of ease, and focus only on this world, they will face 
    humiliation and scorn, and all their affairs will be corrupted. They expose 
    themselves to the wrath and anger of Allaah, and they expose Islam to loss 
    and defeat at the hands of kufr. Hence neglecting jihad is a major sin. 

    Ibn Hajar said in al-Zawaajir: 

    The 390th, 391st and 392nd 
    major sins are neglecting jihad when it becomes an obligation, which is when 
    aggressors enter the Muslim land or when they seize a Muslim, and it is 
    possible to rescue him from them and the people neglect jihad altogether and 
    when the people in a region neglect to fortify their borders so that there 
    is a risk of the kuffaar overrunning them because of that.” end quote. 

    Hence it was well known and well established among the 
    Sahaabah that no one refrains from taking part in jihad when it becomes fard 
    ‘ayn (an individual obligation) except one who is weak and is therefore 
    excused or one who is a hypocrite.  This is what was narrated by Ka’b ibn 
    Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him) when he stayed behind from the 
    campaign of Tabook: “When I came out to the people after the Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had gone out, I went 
    around among them and was distressed to see no one except a man who was 
    known to be a hypocrite or weak men whom Allaah had excused.” Narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari, 4066; Muslim, 4973. 

    The evidence also states some of the punishments that result 
    from that. For example: 

    1 – Neglecting jihad leads to doom in this world and in the 
    Hereafter. 

    In this world the craven coward is humiliated and enslaved, 
    he is a follower, not a leader. In the Hereafter, neglecting jihad will be a 
    cause of Allaah's punishment. 

    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And spend in the Cause 
    of Allaah (i.e. Jihad of all kinds) and do not throw yourselves into 
    destruction (by not spending your wealth in the Cause of Allaah), and do 
    good. Truly, Allaah loves Al-Muhsinoon (the good-doers”
    [al-Baqarah 2:195]

    al-Tirmidhi (2972) narrated that Aslam Abu ‘Imraan said: We 
    were in the city of the Byzantines (i.e., Constantinople) and a great troop 
    of the Byzantines  came out to us. One of the Muslim men attacked the 
    Byzantine ranks until he penetrated them, and the people shouted and said 
    “Subhaan-Allaah, he has thrown himself into destruction.” Abu Ayyoob 
    al-Ansaari stood up and said: “O people, you misinterpret this verse in this 
    way; rather this verse was revealed concerning us, the Ansaar. When Allaah 
    caused Islam to prevail and its supporters increased, we said to one another 
    in secret, without speaking to the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him): ‘Our wealth is neglected. Allaah has 
    caused Islam to prevail and its supporters have increased. Why don’t we stay 
    with our property and improve it?’ Then Allaah revealed Qur’aan to His 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), refuting what we 
    had said: “And spend in the Cause of Allaah (i.e. Jihad of all kinds) and 
    do not throw yourselves into destruction” [al-Baqarah 2:195]. This 
    destruction was our staying with our property to improve it, and neglecting 
    to fight (in jihad). Abu Ayyoob never stopped fighting for the sake of 
    Allaah until he was buried in Constantinople. Classed as saheeh by 
    al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 

    It says in Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi: 
This hadeeth indicates 
    that what is meant by throwing oneself into destruction is taking care of 
    one’s family and wealth at the expense of jihad.  

    2 – Neglecting jihad is a cause of humiliation and scorn 

    Abu Dawood (3462) narrated that Ibn ‘Umar said: I heard the 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: 
    “When you engage in ‘aynah transactions (a kind of transaction intended to 
    circumvent the prohibition on riba or usury), and you take hold of the tails 
    of oxen and you are content with agriculture (at the time when jihad is 
    obligatory), and you give up jihad, then Allaah will send upon you 
    humiliation that will not be dispelled until you return to your religion, 
    Allaah will send upon you humiliation that will not be dispelled until you 
    return to your religion, Allaah will send upon you humiliation that will not 
    be dispelled until you return to your religion.” Classed as saheeh by 
    al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 

    Our Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) indeed spoke the truth, for the one who looks at the state of the 
    Muslims today will see that they have become very careless about their 
    religion. They consume riba and they are focused on this world, and they 
    have neglected jihad for the sake of Allaah. And what is the result? Allaah 
    has subjected them to humiliation, and they turn to the east and to the 
    west, humiliated and lowly, asking them for support against their enemies, 
    and they do not realize [?] that this humiliation will not be lifted from 
    them until they go back to their religion as the truthful Messenger  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said. 

    Allaah has indeed spoken the truth: 

    “Give to the hypocrites the tidings that there is for them 
    a painful torment.
Those who take 
    disbelievers for Awliyaa’ (protectors or helpers or friends) instead of 
    believers, do they seek honour, power and glory with them? Verily, then to 
    Allaah belongs all honour, power and glory”
[al-Nisa’ 4:138-139 – 
    interpretation of the meaning] 

    3 – Neglecting jihad is a cause of Allaah's punishment in 
    this world and in the Hereafter 

    Abu Dawood (2503) narrated from Abu Umaamah that the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever does not 
    fight or does not equip a warrior or support the family of a warrior in his 
    absence, Allaah will strike him with calamity before the Day of 
    Resurrection.” Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 

    Al-Qaari’ah (translated here as calamity) means a disaster 
    that occurs suddenly. 

    And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! What 
    is the matter with you, that when you are asked to march forth in the Cause 
    of Allaah (i.e. Jihaad) you cling heavily to the earth? Are you pleased with 
    the life of this world rather than the Hereafter? But little is the 
    enjoyment of the life of this world as compared to the Hereafter.
If you march not forth, 
    He will punish you with a painful torment and will replace you by another 
    people; and you cannot harm Him at all, and Allaah is Able to do all things”
[al-Tawbah 9:38-39] 

    The punishment of which He warns them is not only punishment 
    in the Hereafter, rather it is punishment in this world and in the 
    Hereafter, the punishment of humiliation that befalls those who do not 
    engage in jihad, the punishment of being deprived of the good things from 
    which the kaafir enemy benefits. In addition to all of that, those who 
    forsake jihad will lose more lives and more wealth than would be lost in 
    jihad, and they offer more sacrifices than those required to retain their 
    honour and dignity. No ummah forsook jihad but Allaah sent humility upon 
    them, thus the cost was far greater than that that may have been required in 
    jihad against the enemy.

     Al-Zilaal, 3/1655. 

    Al-Sa’di (may Allaah have mercy on him) said (p. 532): 

    “O you who believe” do you not know the requirements 
    of faith, which is that you should hasten to obey the command of Allaah and 
    to seek His pleasure, and to fight His enemies in jihad for the sake of your 
    religion? So “What is the matter with you, that when you are asked to 
    march forth in the Cause of Allaah (i.e. Jihaad) you cling heavily to the 
    earth?” meaning, why are you so lazy and so inclined towards this 
    world. 

    “Are you pleased with the life of this world rather than 
    the Hereafter?” Your case is that of those who are content with this 
    world and who strive for worldly purposes, caring nothing for the Hereafter 
    because they do not believe in it. 

    “But little is the enjoyment of the life of this world” 
    towards which you are inclined and which you prefer. Hasn’t Allaah given you 
    reason with which to weigh up matters and see which deserves to be shown 
    preference? 

    Is not this world – from beginning to end – as nothing in 
    comparison to the Hereafter? 

    What is a man's lifespan in comparison to the lifespan of 
    this world, so as to make worldly gain his ultimate goal and concern and 
    restrict all his efforts and focus to this short life that is filled with 
    distress and risk?  

    How can you possibly prefer it to the Hereafter which 
    includes every kind of delight that a person could desire, where you will 
    abide forever? No person who prefers this world to the Hereafter has faith 
    rooted in his heart and he cannot be regarded as a man of wisdom and 
    understanding. Then Allaah warns them if they do not march forth, as He 
    says: 

    “If you march not forth, He will punish you with a painful 
    torment” – in this world and in the Hereafter, for not marching forth 
    when ordered to do so is a major sin that deserves the most severe 
    punishment, because it causes a great deal of harm, because the one who 
    stays behind(from jihad) has disobeyed Allaah and done something that He has 
    forbidden, and he has not helped to support the religion of Allaah or to 
    protect the Book of Allaah and His Law. He has not helped his Muslim 
    brothers against the enemy who wants to uproot them and eradicate their 
    religion.  Perhaps others who are weak in faith will follow his example, and 
    he may even discourage those who are involved in fighting the enemies of 
    Allaah. Thus he will be like those whom Allaah has warned of a severe 
    punishment: “If you march not forth, He will punish you with a painful 
    torment” Allaah has promised to support His religion and make His word 
    supreme regardless of whether you obey the command of Allaah or not. 

    “and Allaah is Able to do all things” He is not 
    incapable of doing anything that He wants, and none can overwhelm Him. 

    We ask Allaah to bring the Muslims back to their religion and 
    to remove humiliation from them.

    If the worshipper enters the mosque and the imam is praying, 
    he should join him no matter what position he is in, whether he is standing, 
    bowing, prostrating or between prostrations. That is because of the report 
    narrated by Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: The 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “If you come to prayer and we are prostrating, then prostrate, but do not 
    regard it as anything. Whoever catches up with a rak’ah has caught up with 
    the prayer.” Narrate by Abu Dawood, 893; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in
    Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
It was narrated that Abu 
    Qataadah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When you come to prayer 
    you must be dignified. Whatever you catch up with, pray, and whatever you 
    miss, complete it.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 635. 

    Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allaah be pleased with him) said in
    Fath al-Baari, 1/118: This is quoted as evidence that it is mustahabb 
    to join the imam in whatever position he is found.” End quote. 

    It was narrated that Mu’aadh ibn Jabal said: The Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When one of you comes to 
    the prayer and the imam is in any position, let him do what the imam is 
    doing.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 591; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in 
    Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
This is the Sunnah with 
    regard to the one who enters the mosque and finds the imam praying, based on 
    the evidence in the texts. 

    Ibn Hazm (may Allaah have mercy on him) narrated that there 
    was scholarly consensus on this point. He said in Maraatib al-Ijmaa’ 
    (p. 25): They said: If a person comes and the imam has already done some of 
    the prayer, a little or a lot, and there is nothing left but the salaam, he 
    should join him and do the same as he finds him doing, unless he has decided 
    to catch up with the congregation in another mosque. End quote. 

    Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni (2/184): 

    It is mustahabb for the one who catches up with the imam in 
    any position to follow him in that, even if it will not count as anything 
    for him… Then he quoted some of the ahaadeeth that we have quoted above… 
    Then he said: This is what is to be done according to the scholars, who 
    said: If a man comes and the imam is prostrating, let him prostrate, but 
    that rak’ah will not count for him. Some of them said: perhaps by the time 
    he raises his head, he will have been forgiven. End quote. 

    There are some people who, if they enter the mosque and find 
    that the imam is prostrating or is between the two prostrations, they do not 
    join him until he stands up for the second rak’ah or until they know that he 
    is reciting the tashahhud, then they sit with him. Such a person has 
    deprived himself of the benefit of prostration, as well as going against 
    what is indicated by the evidence quoted above. 

    It says in Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi (2/199): Let him do what 
    the imam is doing, i.e., let him join the imam whether he is standing, 
    bowing or whatever. He should not wait for the imam to stand up as the 
    common folk do. End quote.

The scholars of the 
    Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas were asked about a man who enters the 
    mosque when the imam is in the final rak’ah. Should he join them or wait 
    until they have finished? 

    They replied: 

    What is prescribed in your situation is to join them. 
    Whatever you catch up with, pray with them, and whatever you miss, make it 
    up. If you join them after they stand up from bowing in the last rak’ah, 
    then join them and make up the entire prayer after the imam says the salaam. 
    …. Then they quoted as evidence the ahaadeeth that we have quoted above. End

    The scholars of the Standing Committee were also asked: What 
    is better if a man enters the mosque and the imam is reciting the final 
    tashahhud – should he join him in the tashahhud or is it better to wait for 
    some other people to come so that they can pray together? 

    They replied: 

    It is better for him to join the imam, because of the general 
    meaning of the hadeeth: “Whatever you catch up with, pray, and whatever you 
    miss, make it up.” End quote.

      give money instead of what is required because of a vow, unless what was

      is permissible to give the money as one vowed to do. But if a person vows 
      to give all his wealth, he is only obliged to give one-third of it. 
      Similarly it is not sufficient to give money for an ‘aqeeqah or waleemah 
      (wedding feast) because the Sunnah regarding ‘aqeeqah is to slaughter two 
      sheep for a boy and one for a girl. And the Sunnah regarding the wedding 
      feast is for a man to give a feast after he gets married, even if it is 
      with only one sheep, because of the saheeh report from the Prophet  
      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), according to which he said to 
      ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn ‘Awf, after he got married: “Give a wedding feast,

      Spending money instead goes against the Sunnah and there is no basis for

What is the ruling on this?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
      We put this question to Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Barraak

The basic principle 
    regarding the exchange of gold for gold and silver for silver is that equal 
    amounts must be given, like for like. It makes no difference whether 
    something is faulty or broken, etc. 

    Banknotes nowadays have taken the place of gold and silver in 
    that the value of things is measured in terms of them. 

    But we cannot apply all the rulings on gold and silver to 
    banknotes, because bank notes do not have any value in and of themselves, 
    rather their value is conferred by the state which issues them. 

    Hence I say that there is nothing wrong with exchanging torn banknotes for half of their value, because they have now lost their value (i.e., by becoming torn).",Islam Q&A - Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
46849,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/46849,He is twenty years old… and he has not been circumcised,"I am a young man aged 20. I had an operation when I was little and for that reason I was not circumcised. After that I went to the hospital and the doctor told me that I had to do the operation first because of a physical defect in the same area, then I should be circumcised. Years have gone by and I have not done the first operation and so I have not yet been circumcised. I have reached the age of twenty and this is my situation, and I pray in the mosque. What is the ruling in this case?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Circumcision is obligatory for men according to the majority 
    of scholars, and it is one of the sunan al-fitrah (the actions 
    connected to the sound nature of man), as the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The actions of the fitrah are five: 
    circumcision, shaving the pubic hair, trimming the moustache, clipping the 
    nails and plucking the armpit hairs.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5441; Muslim, 
    377. 

    Al-Bukhaari (3107) and Muslim (4368) narrated that Abu 
    Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Ibraaheem (peace be upon 
    him) circumcised himself when he was eighty years old.” 

    But that fuqaha’ have stated that if an adult fears that 
    circumcision may harm him, then it is waived in his case. Ibn Qudaamah (may 
    Allaah be pleased with him) said: “Section: With regard to circumcision, it 
    is obligatory for men and an honour for women, but is not obligatory for 
    them. This is the view of many of the scholars. Ahmad said: It is more 
    obligatory for a man, because if a man is not circumcised, then that skin is 
    covering the glans and it cannot be cleaned properly. And it is less 
    important for women.” 

    Abu ‘Abd-Allaah (i.e., Imam Ahmad) said: Ibn ‘Abbaas was very 
    strict on this issue. It was narrated from him that there is no Hajj and no 
    prayer for one who is not circumcised. But al-Hasan granted a concession 
    with regard to that, and said: If a person becomes Muslim, it does not 
    matter if he is not circumcised. He said: Black and white people became 
    Muslim, and no one examined them, and they did not get circumcised. The 
    evidence that it is obligatory is that covering the ‘awrah is obligatory, 
    and if it were not for the fact that circumcision is obligatory it would not 
    be permissible to transgress the sanctity of the person being circumcised 
    and look at his ‘awrah in order to carry out this procedure. And this is one 
    of the symbols of the Muslims. So it is obligatory, as are all the other 
    symbols of Islam. If an adult man becomes a Muslim and he fears that being 
    circumcised will harm him, it is waived in his case, because ghusl and 
    wudoo’, etc are also waived if there is the fear that they will cause harm, 
    so it is more appropriate that circumcision be waived (in this case). If a 
    person is sure that he will not be harmed by it, then he has to do it. 
    Hanbal said: I asked Abu ‘Abd-Allaah about the dhimmi (Jew or Christian 
    living under Islamic rule) who becomes a Muslim: Do you think that he needs 
    to be circumcised? He said: It is essential. I said: Even if he or she is 
    old? He said: I like for him to be purified by that, because of the 
    hadeeth:  “Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) circumcised himself when he was 
    eighty years old.” And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “it 
    is the religion of your father Ibraaheem (Abraham)” [al-Hajj 22:78]. 

    From al-Mughni, 1/101 

    It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (5/113): 
Circumcision is one of 
    the Sunnahs of the Fitrah, for both males and females, but it is obligatory 
    for males and a Sunnah and an honour for women. 

    With the advances in the field of medicine, circumcision has 
    become a safe procedure in most cases, so you should hasten to get 
    circumcised and fulfil this obligation, follow the example of the Prophets, 
    preserve your sound human nature (fitrah) and be on the safe side with 
    regard to worship. 

    And Allaah knows best.",Islam Q&A
46857,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/46857,Is it permissible to give zakaah to a family fund to help the poor?,"I have 5000 pounds and one and a half years have passed since I acquired them. What is the zakaah that must be paid? If anything is left of this 5000 after another year has passed, will I have to pay zakaah on it? In our family we have a fund in the name of the family and I pay a certain amount of money to help the poor members of the family. I am late in paying; can I give them the zakaah of this money so long as it is an ongoing charity?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Whoever has money that reaches the nisaab (minimum amount at 
    which zakaah becomes due) and a full hijri year has passed (since acquiring 
    it) has to pay zakaah on it. 
This nisaab for money is 
    the equivalent of 85 grams of gold or 595 grams of silver, whichever is 
    lower in value.  

    See al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 6/103-104); Majmoo’ Fataawa 
    Ibn ‘Uthyameen, 18/248.

    Based on this, the amount that you have – 5000 pounds – 
    reaches the nisaab, so you have to pay zakaah. 

    Secondly: The amount that you have to give is one-quarter of 
    one-tenth, or 2.5%. With regard to the amount in question – 5000 pounds – 
    the zakaah that is due is 125 pounds. 

    Thirdly: If a hijri year has passed since you acquired the 
    nisaab, then zakaah must be paid immediately and it is not permissible to 
    delay it. See al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 6/186. 

    Based on this, your delaying zakaah for half a year after the 
    full year had passed is a shortcoming and you have to repent from that and 
    hasten to give the zakaah. 

    Fourthly: With regard to your question, “If anything is left 
    of this 5000 after another year has passed, will I have to pay zakaah on 
    it?”, the answer is: every time a year has passed and the nisaab (minimum 
    amount) is still there, zakaah is due on it. If the amount of money falls 
    below the niasaab then no zakaah is due. If the money reaches the nisaab 
    again then zakaah is due again, and the reckoning of the year should start 
    from the time when the money reaches the nisaab. 

    Fifthly: With regard to giving the zakaah to the family fund, 
    there are eight areas in which zakaah may be spent, which Allaah has 
    described in the verse where He says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “As-Sadaqaat (here it means Zakaah) are only for the 
    Fuqaraa’ (poor), and Al‑Masaakeen (the poor) and those employed to collect 
    (the funds); and to attract the hearts of those who have been inclined 
    (towards Islam); and to free the captives; and for those in debt; and for 
    Allaah’s Cause (i.e. for Mujaahidoon — those fighting in a holy battle), and 
    for the wayfarer (a traveller who is cut off from everything); a duty 
    imposed by Allaah. And Allaah is All-Knower, All-Wise”

    [al-Tawbah 9:60]
Giving zakaah to poor 
    relatives is better than giving it to others, because the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Charity given to a poor 
    person is charity, and charity given to a relative is two things: charity 
    and upholding the ties of kinship.” Narrated by al-Nasaa’i, 2582; classed as 
    saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Nasaa’i.

     There is nothing wrong with giving zakaah to the family 
    fund, so long as you tell the person in charge of the fund that this is 
    zakaah, so that he will spend it in one of the areas defined in the verse 
    quoted above, and he will hasten to spend it immediately.

46868,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/46868,The number of expiations depends on the number of oaths,I am a mother and I swore many oath to make my children do things and sometimes the oath is broken. Should I offer kafaarat yameen (expiation for breaking a oath) once or what should I do?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    It is makrooh to be careless in swearing aaths, because 
    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And (O Muhammad) obey 
    you not everyone Hallaaf Maheen (the one who swears much and is a liar or is 
    worthless)”

    [al-Qalam 68:10]

    This indicates that the one who swears oaths a great deal is 
    to be criticized, so try not to swear oaths too much, out of respect towards 
    Allaah and so as to protect your oaths. 

    You should note that swearing oaths a great deal for 
    everything, minor or major, leads to weakening the value of oaths and vows 
    in people’s eyes, and there is no guarantee that this will not lead to 
    making false oaths, and it also indicate that one does not fear Allaah 
    completely. 

    With regard to the oath that you have sworn, they may be 
    interpreted in one of two ways: 

    1 – When you swore the oath you meant to swear an oath, in 
    whole or in part, i.e., you meant to swear a binding oath. In this case you 
    have to offer kafaarat yameen. A binding oath is one which a person swears 
    concerning something in the future, that he will do something or not do 
    something. 

    2 – When you swore the oath you did not mean to swear an oath 
    as such. This comes under the heading of idle oaths. The scholars differed 
    as to the precise definition of idle oaths (laghw al-yameen). The most 
    correct view is that the idle oath includes the following: 

    1-That which the speaker utters 
    unintentionally, such as when a man says, “No, by Allaah, I will never go” 
    or “Yes, by Allaah, I will go.” This is the view of the Shaafa’is and 
    Hanbalis.

    2-When a person utters an oath 
    thinking that he is speaking the truth, then he realizes that it was not 
    true. This is the view of the Hanbalis.

    3-Shaykh al-Islam added to the 
    definition of an idle oath cases where the one who swears the oath thinks 
    that the one concerning whom it is sworn will not go against him, then he 
    does go against him. By the same token a person does not break his oath if 
    he swore that another person would do something by way of honouring him, not 
    by way of compelling him. He said: Because it is like a command; a command 
    is not binding if it is understood to be by way of honouring, because the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded Abu Bakr 
    to stand in the row but he did not stand. See Majmoo’at al-Rasaa’il 
    al-Fiqhiyyah by Shaykh Khaalid al-Mushayqih, p. 234.

    Based on the above, if all or some of your oaths were 
    binding, then you have to offer kafaarat yameen, but do you have to offer it 
    once or several times? That depends on the content of the oath. If all your 
    oaths had to do with the same thing, then you have to offer expiation only 
    once. But if you swore oaths concerning a number of things, such as saying, 
    “By Allaah, I will not eat today” and “By Allaah, I will not drink today” 
    and “By Allaah, I will not travel today”, then you have to offer expiation 
    for each of these things if you did it. If you ate and drank and travelled 
    then you have to offer three expiations. If you swore one oath concerning a 
    number of things, such as if you said, “By Allaah, I will not eat or drink 
    or travel,” then you have to offer expiation once for doing one or all of 
    these things. (op. cit., p. 266). 

    But if all or some of your oaths were idle oaths, then the 
    majority of scholars have stated that no expiation is required for breaking 
    an idle oath, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allaah will not call you 
    to account for that which is unintentional in your oaths”
    [al-Baqarah 2:225]

46876,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/46876,Her brother is very audacious in committing sin – what should she do with him?,"I have a brother who is younger than me, 20 years old. I know that he commits all the sins that Allaah has forbidden, and my father and mother are righteous but they cannot set him straight. I fear for him but every time I try to speak to him he reacts by telling me than he has no aim in life and he wants to die. He always says why should I set myself straight and for whom? What can I do for my only brother?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    I ask Allaah to bless your brother with guidance and 
    righteousness, and to bring him back to the straight path, and to help you 
    to call him and guide him to what is good and to make that count in the 
    balance of your good deeds. 

    You should note – may Allaah bless you – that there are a 
    number of ways in which you can call your brother and guide him. These 
    include the following: 

    Firstly: Pray sincerely for your brother to be guided and set 
    aright, and have certain faith that Allaah will respond. Keep on praying for 
    that, and know that Allaah will never let down the one who puts his hope in 
    Him or refuse to answer the one who prays to Him with sincerity. 

    Secondly: Try to advise him sincerely, seeking to convince 
    him rationally. Encourage him by telling him of the honour and great reward 
    that Allaah has prepared, and warn him by telling him of the punishment and 
    humiliation and severe torment that Allaah has prepared for the sinners. 
    Tell him about the true nature of this life, and that Allaah has only 
    created this universe – with its earth and heaven, seas and rivers, 
    mountains and plains, lowlands and deserts, for you, O man. How can you, O 
    weak creature, compare to these mighty creations which Allaah has subjugated 
    for you, to make your life easier, as Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “He it is Who created for you all that is on earth”

    [al-Baqarah 2:29] 

    “He it is Who has made the earth subservient to you (i.e. 
    easy for you to walk, to live and to do agriculture on it); so walk in the 
    path thereof and eat of His provision. And to Him will be the Resurrection”

    [al-Mulk 67:15] 

    “See you not (O men) that Allaah has subjected for you 
    whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth, and has 
    completed and perfected His Graces upon you, (both) apparent (i.e. Islamic 
    Monotheism, and the lawful pleasures of this world, including health, good 
    looks) and hidden [i.e. one’s faith in Allaah (of Islamic Monotheism), 
    knowledge, wisdom, guidance for doing righteous deeds, and also the 
    pleasures and delights of the Hereafter in Paradise]?”

    [Luqmaan 31:20]
Indeed He has preferred 
    you above all these earthly creations, as He says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “And indeed We have honoured the Children of Adam, and We 
    have carried them on land and sea, and have provided them with At‑Tayyibaat 
    (lawful good things), and have preferred them above many of those whom We 
    have created with a marked preferment”

    [al-Isra’ 17:70]

    If you know this, O weak creature, and that Allaah has 
    created all these great creations and subjugated them for your comfort in 
    this life, then hasten to ask the logical question which occurs to every 
    wise person: Why did Allaah create me then? Your Lord and Creator has 
    clearly answered this question, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And I (Allaah) created not the jinn and mankind except 
    that they should worship Me (Alone)”

    [al-Dhaariyaat 51:56]

    So the purpose for which you have been created, O man, is 
    this: To submit yourself truly and sincerely to Allaah, the One, the Only. 
    This is the answer to your question: for whom should I set myself straight? 
    You should set yourself straight for Allaah Who has created you and formed 
    you, Who has given you life, strength and health, and all the blessings that 
    you enjoy. They all come from Him alone, and if He so willed He could take 
    them all away from you in the blink of an eye. Does He not deserve that you 
    should your gratitude for these innumerable blessings by doing what He 
    commands and avoiding what He has forbidden, which is the essence of the 
    worship for which you were created. With regard to your saying why should I 
    set myself straight, Allaah has stated the reason why He created death and 
    life in this world. It is so that you may know the greater reality which, 
    once a man knows it, he cannot have any peace of mind until he attains the 
    pleasure of Allaah and meets Him in Paradise. Allaah says (interpretation of 
    the meaning): 

    “Who has created death and life that He may test you which 
    of you is best in deed. And He is the All‑Mighty, the Oft‑Forgiving”

    [al-Mulk 67:2]

    So you should understand this and understand that your 
    Creator is testing you now, in this world, to see what you will do and to 
    recompense you accordingly on the Day when you meet Him – if it is good then 
    you will be rewarded and if it is bad then you will be punished – and you 
    should understand that after death man will never be left neglected, rather 
    he will be recompensed according to his deeds as Allaah says (interpretation 
    of the meaning): 

    “Does man think that he will be left neglected (without 
    being punished or rewarded for the obligatory duties enjoined by his Lord 
    Allaah on him)?”

    [al-Qiyaamah 75:36],   
Based on this, you will 
    notice that Allaah often describes in His Book what He has prepared for His 
    slaves who do good in this world, for in the Hereafter they will have with 
    Him Paradise that is as wide as the heavens and the earth, in which there is 
    what no eye has seen, no ear has heard and it has not entered the heart of 
    man. And He also often describes what He has prepared for those who do evil 
    and neglect His rights over them; it is blazing Fire in which they will 
    neither live nor die, in which He has prepared all kinds of humiliation and 
    torment which would cause a child’s hair to turn white if he heard of them, 
    let alone saw them with his own eyes. We ask Allaah to keep us and you safe 
    from it. 

    After knowing all this, is it befitting for you to dare to go 
    against His commands or to live for any purpose other than that for which 
    you have been created? By Allaah the poet spoke the truth when he said: 

    If when we die we are abandoned, then death would be the end 
    of every living thing

    But when we die we will be resurrected and asked after that 
    about everything. 

    Undoubtedly the anxiety and worry that you are feeling make 
    you wish for death; that is because you have lost the sense of this noble, 
    divinely-ordained goal. The greatest and most enjoyable thing in this 
    universe is to be a true slave of Allaah. So beware of turning away from 
    your Lord and becoming far away from Him, for you will return to Him even if 
    you live a very long life, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “O man! Verily, you are returning towards your Lord  with 
    your deeds and actions (good or bad), a sure returning, and you will meet 
    (the results of your deeds which you did).”

    [al-Inshiqaaq 84:6]
Beware lest you meet Him 
    having turned away from Him, and the following words apply to you 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “But whosoever turns away from My Reminder (i.e. neither 
    believes in this Qur’aan nor acts on its teachings) verily, for him is a 
    life of hardship, and We shall raise him up blind on the Day of 
    Resurrection.

    125. He will say: ‘O my Lord! Why have you raised me up 
    blind, while I had sight (before).’

    126. (Allaah) will say: ‘Like this: Our Ayaat (proofs, 
    evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) came unto you, but you 
    disregarded them (i.e. you left them, did not think deeply in them, and you 
    turned away from them), and so this Day, you will be neglected (in the 
    Hell‑fire, away from Allaah’s Mercy).’

    127. And thus do We requite him who transgresses beyond 
    bounds [i.e. commits the great sins and disobeys his Lord (Allaah) and 
    believes not in His Messengers, and His revealed Books, like this Qur’aan], 
    and believes not in the Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, 
    revelations, etc.) of his Lord; and the torment of the Hereafter is far more 
    severe and more lasting”

    [Ta-Ha 20:124-127]

    So hasten to repent sincerely, and you will find a Lord Who 
    is generous and rejoices over His slave when he repents, and is pleased with 
    him when he repents. Indeed He bestows such love and mercy upon him that has 
    never crossed anyone’s mind. So what are you waiting for? Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “So flee to Allaah (from His Torment to His Mercy 
    – Islamic Monotheism). Verily, I 
    (Muhammad) am a plain warner to you from Him”

    [al-Dhaariyaat 51:50]

    Once you have understood this, then note – may Allaah help 
    you to do that which pleases Him – that this great blessing, salvation from 
    that painful torment and success in this great test can only be attained by 
    means of hard work and difficulty which requires patience, perseverance and 
    longsuffering. But it is a hardship that will quickly pass and suffering 
    that will soon end, to be followed by eternal bliss and everlasting 
    pleasure. What is a little hardship and pain when compared with eternal 
    delight and everlasting joy. 

    We ask Allaah to bless us all with His bounty and His 
    Paradise… 

    In conclusion, I would like to leave you with these great 
    verses from the Book of Allaah, which He revealed to His slave Muhammad  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to be a healing for the hearts 
    of the believers and a remedy for their ills, so read them and ponder their 
    meaning, so that Allaah may make them a balm and a healing for the anxiety 
    and distress that you are suffering.  

    Our Lord said (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Verily, those who say: ‘Our Lord is Allaah (Alone),’ and 
    then they stand firm, on them the angels will descend (at the time of their 
    death) (saying): ‘Fear not, nor grieve! But receive the glad tidings of 
    Paradise which you have been promised!

    31. ‘We have been your friends in the life of this world 
    and are (so) in the Hereafter. Therein you shall have (all) that your 
    inner‑selves desire, and therein you shall have (all) for which you ask.

    32. ‘An entertainment from (Allaah), the Oft‑Forgiving, 
    Most Merciful’”

    [Fussilat 41:30-32]

    “Verily, those who say: ‘Our Lord is (only) Allaah,’ and 
    thereafter stand firm (on the Islamic Faith of Monotheism), on them shall be 
    no fear, nor shall they grieve.

    14. Such shall be the dwellers of Paradise, abiding 
    therein (forever)-a 
    reward for what they used to do”

    [al-Ahqaaf 46:13-14]

    “O you who believe! Fear Allaah and keep your duty to Him. 
    And let every person look to what he has sent forth for the morrow, and fear 
    Allaah. Verily, Allaah is All‑Aware of what you do.

    19. And be not like those who forgot Allaah (i.e. became 
    disobedient to Allaah), and He caused them to forget their ownselves (let 
    them to forget to do righteous deeds). Those are the Faasiqoon (rebellious, 
    disobedient to Allaah).

    20. Not equal are the dwellers of the Fire and the 
    dwellers of the Paradise. It is the dwellers of Paradise that will be 
    successful”

    [al-Hashr 59:18-20]

    And there are many other verses which explain this great 
    truth clearly. So you must turn to the Book of Allaah, in which you will 
    find all that is good, and keep away from everything that is bad and evil.

I don't think she can do anything about it though, since we rely on our dad financially. We also need him beside us because we live in Canada, which is a whole new country for us. Can you please tell me how I should deal with my dad? Or how I should treat him after this incident? Should I even speak to him at all?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    To Allaah we belong and unto Him is our return. This, by 
    Allaah, is something that would make one weep. Have things become so bad 
    that the fitrah has been turned upside down and a father feels such things 
    towards his daughter? 

    There is no doubt that this father is mentally ill and 
    sexually deviant, and he needs urgent and intense treatment for his heart 
    and mind, both psychological and physical treatment. 

    For yourself, you need to take measures to make it difficult 
    for your father to find any opportunity or time to seduce you or interfere 
    with you. Do not be alone with him in the house, and lock the door when you 
    are in your room. Do not let him enter upon you on his own. All of these 
    measures will reduce the opportunities for interfering. But in order to stop 
    this problem altogether, that can only be done by getting treatment for your 
    father, or telling everyone about the problem. You have to realize that you 
    need to be prepared for the effects that disclosing the situation will have 
    on you and on the whole family, but this is better than things staying as 
    they are now. 

    Your mother has to fear Allaah; her not caring about what her 
    husband is doing is something for which she will be called to account and 
    she will be regarded as a partner in his crime, because she could do 
    something to stop him doing this evil deed. 

    You can seek the help of one of your wise relatives to 
    intervene in this matter and stop the deviation of this sick father. 

    Undoubtedly these sick actions on the part of some fathers 
    have their causes, and no one can deal with a problem without knowing its 
    causes and how to treat it. Some of these causes have to do with the father, 
    some with the daughter herself and some with the time and place in which the 
    family lives. 

    The causes of this deviation that have to do with the father 
    include the following: 

    1-Weak faith, lack of fear of 
    Allaah and a failure to realize that He is watching.

    2-Addiction to alcohol or drugs.

    3-Mental or psychological 
    illness.

    4-Watching provocative shows on 
    satellite channels, or looking at permissive pictures

    5-Too much free time

    The causes that may have to do with the daughter include: 

    1-Careless in the manner of 
    dress. Many girls wear tight and short clothes in front of their fathers and 
    brothers, which goes against sharee’ah and may provoke evil desires in sick 
    souls that have been stirred up by satellite channels and permissive 
    pictures.

    2-Carelessness in some actions, 
    such as kissing on the mouth or provocative touching, or sleeping in the 
    same bed or under the same cover as her father or brother. These actions are 
    also contrary to sharee’ah and provoke evil.

    If we want to deal with such deeds that go against the fitrah 
    (sound human nature) and Islam then we must put a stop to these causes that 
    lead to such decadence. This may be done in the following ways: 

    1-Striving to spread virtue and 
    good morals among the family members, and to strengthen their faith in 
    Allaah, their awareness that He is watching and their fear of Him. This may 
    be achieved by observing prayer regularly and on time, and keeping away from 
    forbidden things and bad attitudes.

    2-Totally avoiding looking at, 
    listening to or reading provocative programs and stories.

    3-Keeping away from bad company 
    who only lead one to evil and bad things.

    4-Keeping girls away from clothes 
    that go against Islam, such as tight, short and see-through clothes; 
    avoiding provocative touching and kissing on the mouth.

    5-Seeking spacious living 
    quarters where a girl will not need to be with her father or brothers in the 
    same room or under the same blanket.

    6-The mother should play her role 
    in tackling such problems, by not being heedless or careless about anything 
    she sees or hears that goes against sharee’ah, and she should not wait until 
    things get really bad or cannot be set right. Rather she has to be aware 
    from the outset, and not allow her daughter to be careless or allow her 
    husband to do whatever he wants.

    7-Wise relatives should be 
    informed of such actions so that matters may be dealt with. If that does not 
    work, then you have to make a complaint to the sharee’ah court or to the 
    security services in order to stop his evil actions towards you.

    8-Our sister who has asked this 
    question needs to take the matter seriously and not delay taking action. We 
    advise her to make du’aa’ and seek out the times when du’aa’s are answered, 
    such as the last third of the night, asking that your father be guided and 
    that his evil be withheld from you.

    9-It is haraam for you to take 
    your father’s actions lightly. You have to ward him off with all the 
    strength you have, and raise your voice in shouting for help, even if that 
    leads to his being shamed or imprisoned.

    10-If none of these 
    solutions work, then we do not advise you to stay in the house. We advise 
    you go and live with some righteous sisters or with your relatives where you 
    can live with them in accordance with Islamic rulings.

    We ask Allaah to relieve your distress and to guide your 
    father and withhold his evil from you.
