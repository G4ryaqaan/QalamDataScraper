So that should not be done, whether via microphone or anything else, because the time of the prayer is known, praise be to Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Indeed in the Messenger of Allaah (Muhammad) you have a good example to follow for him who hopes for (the Meeting with) Allaah and the Last Day, and remembers Allaah much”
[al-Ahzaab 33:21]
So the people in authority, rulers and scholars, should tell the people about the ruling on this prayer before the day of Eid, and explain to them how it is to be done and what they should do during the prayer, and before and after, so that they will be prepared to attend the prayer place on time, and perform the prayer as prescribed in sharee’ah.

Can you pay zakat al-fitr early?","Praise be to Allah.Time for paying zakat al-fitr
The time for paying zakat al-fitr does not begin after the ‘Eid prayer, rather it starts after sunset on the last day of Ramadan, which is the first night of the month of Shawwal, and it ends with the ‘Eid prayer. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded that zakat al-fitr should be paid before the prayer. Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever pays it before the prayer, it is an accepted zakah (i.e., zakat al-fitr), and whoever pays it after the prayer, it is ordinary charity.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 2/262-263, no. 1609; Ibn Majah, 1/585, no. 1827; al-Daraqutni, 2/138; al-Hakim, 1/409)
Can you pay zakat al-fitr early?
It is permissible to pay it one or two days before that, because of the report narrated by Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoined sadaqat al-fitr in Ramadan.” 
According to another report, they used to pay it one or two days before the end of Ramadan.  
Whoever delays it after its time has sinned, and he has to repent for delaying and give it to the poor.

When to make intention for fasting


Is uttering the intention for fasting out loud required?


How to formulate the intention to fast","Praise be to Allah.Do you have to say intention for fasting?
The Ramadan fast and other acts of worship are not valid unless accompanied by the proper intention. This is because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Actions are but by intentions, and everyone shall have but that which he intended…” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1; Muslim, 1907) 
When to make intention for fasting
The intention is subject to the condition that it be made at night, before the dawn comes. This is because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does not intend to fast before dawn, there is no fast for him.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 730)
According to a version narrated by al-Nasai (2334): “Whoever does not intend to fast from the night before, there is no fast for him.” (Classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi, 573)
What is meant is that whoever does not intend to fast and resolve to do so from the night before, his fast is not valid. 
Is uttering the intention for fasting out loud required?
The intention (niyyah) is an action of the heart. The Muslim should resolve in his heart that he is going to fast tomorrow. It is not prescribed for him to utter it out loud and say, “I intend to fast” or “I will fast tomorrow” or other phrases that have been innovated by some people. 
How to formulate the intention to fast
The correct intention is when a person resolves in his heart that he is going to fast tomorrow. 
Hence Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in al-Ikhtiyarat (p. 191): 
“If it crosses a person’s mind that he is going to fast tomorrow, then he has made the intention.”
The Standing Committee was asked: How should a person intend to fast Ramadan ? 
They replied: 
“The intention is done by resolving to fast. It is essential that the intention to fast Ramadan be made every night.” (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 10/246)

If you fast without entering Islam, you will not gain anything from it except hunger and thirst, because Allaah does not accept any acts of worship unless they are based on correct belief and sound religious commitment. 
The most important thing for you – and the most important thing overall – is to start with the right step, which is entering Islam.
 After that you can start to pray and fast, and read Qur’aan, and do all the acts of worship which will bring life and joy to your heart.  
It is not difficult for you to enter Islam, all you need to do is to utter the Shahaadatayn (the twin testimony of faith): Ash-hadu an laa ilaaha ill-Allaah wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadan rasool-Allaah (I bear witness that there is no god except Allaah and I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah).

Do you think that the life of this world is no more than leisure, idle pursuits and satisfying desires, then it all comes to an end when you die?
 No way! For after death comes the reckoning, and after the reckoning comes either Paradise or Hell. 
So you must hasten to do that which will lead to your salvation. Do not wait or hesitate, for life passes quickly and no one knows when his life will come to an end and he will enter the first stage of the Hereafter, where regret will be of no avail, and a man will wish that he could return to this world so that he could believe and do righteous deeds.
“Until, when death comes to one of them (those who join partners with Allaah), he says: ‘My Lord! Send me back,
So that I may do good in that which I have left behind!’ No! It is but a word that he speaks; and behind them is Barzakh (a barrier) until the Day when they will be resurrected”

[al-An’aam 6:27 – interpretation of the meaning] 
“But those who disbelieve (in the Oneness of Allaah — Islamic Monotheism), for them will be the fire of Hell. Neither will it have a complete killing effect on them so that they die nor shall its torment be lightened for them. Thus do We requite every disbeliever!
Therein they will cry: ‘Our Lord! Bring us out, we shall do righteous good deeds, not (the evil deeds) that we used to do.’ (Allaah will reply:) ‘Did We not give you lives long enough, so that whosoever would receive admonition could receive it? And the warner came to you. So taste you (the evil of your deeds). For the Zaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers) there is no helper.’”

Does looking at women invalidate the fast?","Praise be to Allah.Ruling on looking at women
Looking at (non-mahram) women is haram because Allah has commanded the believers to lower their gaze. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts).” [al-Nur 24:30]
This was also enjoined by His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). It was narrated that Jarir said: I asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about a sudden accidental glance. He said, “Avert your gaze .” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, al-Nikah, 1836; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud, no. 1880) 
Hence it is obligatory to follow the command of Allah and His Messenger. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And let those who oppose the Messenger’s (Muhammad’s) commandment (i.e. his Sunnah legal ways, orders, acts of worship, statements) (among the sects) beware, lest some Fitnah (disbelief, trials, afflictions, earthquakes, killing, overpowered by a tyrant) should befall them or a painful torment be inflicted on them.” [al-Nur 34:63]

Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked the following question: 
A woman caused her period to come by taking some medicine, so she stopped praying. Should she make up those prayers or not? 
He replied: 
The woman should not make up the prayers if she took medicine to make her period start and it started, because hayd means blood which, if it is present, the rulings on it apply. Similarly if she took medicine to prevent menstruation and she did not menstruate, then she should pray and fast because she is not menstruating. So the ruling depends on the cause of the ruling. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“They ask you concerning menstruation. Say: that is an Adha (a harmful thing for a husband to have a sexual intercourse with his wife while she is having her menses)”

Prohibition against obscene speech: Only in Ramadan?","Praise be to Allah.Does swearing break your fast?
Committing sins during the day in Ramadan, such as swearing or insulting others, does not invalidate the fast as such, but it detracts from the reward for fasting. These sins may take away all of the reward, and the fasting person is left with nothing as a result of his fast apart from hunger and thirst. 
Purpose of fasting in Islam
The fasting person is enjoined to guard all his faculties against disobeying Allah. The purpose behind fasting is not simply to refrain from eating and drinking, rather the purpose is to refrain from disobeying Allah and to achieve piety or fear of Allah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Observing As-Sawm (the fasting) is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, that you may become Al-Muttaqun (the pious.)” [al-Baqarah 2:183]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does not give up false speech and acting upon it, Allah has no need of his giving up his food and drink.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1903, 6075)
How to respond to insults while fasting
False speech includes all kinds of speech that are haram, such as lying , backbiting, slandering, insulting and cursing. 
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If any one of you is fasting, let him not utter obscenities or act in an ignorant manner, and if anyone insults him or wants to fight him, let him say, I am fasting.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1894; Muslim 1151)
Al-Hafiz said: 
“Let him not utter obscene speech” means let him not say any foul words. 
“Let him not act in an ignorant manner” means let him not do any of the actions done by ignorant people such as yelling, being foolish, etc.  
What is meant by this hadith is that he should not react in kind, rather he should limit himself to saying, ‘I am fasting.’”
If the fasting person is commanded not to react to one who insults him, how can it be appropriate for him to mistreat people or be the first to insult them? 
Prohibition against obscene speech: Only in Ramadan?
Al-Nawawi said: 
“Note that the prohibition against obscene speech, ignorant action, argument and insults on the part of one who is fasting is not restricted only to him, rather each of these things is forbidden in general, but the prohibition is stronger in the case of one who is fasting.” 
Al-Hakim narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Fasting does not just mean abstaining from food and drink, rather fasting means abstaining from idle and obscene speech. If someone curses you or treats you in an ignorant manner, then say, ‘I am fasting, I am fasting.’” 
Ibn Majah (1690) said: Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “It may be that the fasting person gets nothing from his fast apart from hunger, and it may be that the one who prays qiyam at night may get nothing from his qiyam but a sleepless night.”

 Who is this fasting person? Is it the one who has no food with which to break his fast? Or is it the wayfarer? Or is it any other person even if he is well off? The reason why I am asking this question is that we live in America and the members of the Muslim community here are living a life of ease, and they issue invitations in Ramadaan – so it seems – for the purpose of competing and showing off… (So and so is more generous than So and so, and So and so is a better cook than So and so… etc). May Allaah reward you with good.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The reward for offering iftaar to one who is fasting is great as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever gives iftaar to one who is fasting will have a reward like his, without that detracting from the reward of the fasting person in the slightest.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 708l classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Targheeb wa’l-Tarheeb, 1078. See also Question no. 12598. 
This reward is earned by everyone who gives iftaar to one who is fasting. It is not subject to the condition that the fasting person be poor, because this is not a kind of charity, rather it is a kind of a gift, and a gift is not subject to the condition that the recipient be poor. Rather it is acceptable to give gifts to both rich and poor. 
With regard to the invitations whose purpose is to compete and show off, they are something blameworthy and the one who does this will not have any reward for this action, so they are depriving themselves of a great deal of good. 
The person who receives such an invitation should not attend or take part in them, rather he should excuse himself. Then if he is able to advise the one who does that, in the nicest manner that is most likely to be accepted, that is good. He should avoid speaking directly, and use subtle words and speak in general terms that are not directed at any specific person.  
For kind and gentle words and good manners, and avoiding harsh words, are among the means of causing advice to be accepted. The Muslim is keen that his fellow-Muslim should accept the truth and act upon it. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to do that. Some of his companions did things that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) denounced, but he did not confront them with that, rather he would say, “What is wrong with people who do such and such…?” 
This manner of speaking should achieve the desired purpose.

If the plane takes off before sunset, and he wants to complete that day’s fast whilst traveling , then he should not break his fast until the sun sets in the place where he is in the air. 
It is not permissible for the pilot to take the plane down to a level where the sun cannot be seen so that the people can break their fast sooner, because this is a kind of trick.

But masturbation at night in Ramadan does not invalidate your fast, either on the day before or the day after.",,"Praise be to Allah.The correct scholarly view is that masturbation is haram . 
If a person masturbates at night in Ramadan, that does not invalidate his fast, either on the day before or the day after. 
But the Muslim must strive to control himself and avoid doing this haram action and others, especially during this blessed month.  
The Muslim has to make the most of this blessed month , for fasting is the best treatment for this haram thing. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded young men who were unable to get married to fast. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “O young men, whoever among you can afford it, let him get married , and whoever cannot afford it, then he should fast, for that will be a shield for him” – i.e., fasting will curb his desire. 
Whoever has been tested with this must repent to Allah and regret what he has done, and resolve not to do it again.

37679,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/37679,Hearing the Adhan of Fajr while Having Intercourse,"What is the ruling if the adhan is given for Fajr when a man is having intercourse with his wife? Should he carry on until he reaches climax, or should he stop as soon as he hears the adhan? Please advise us, may Allah reward you with good.","If the muadhdhin gives the adhan at the time when Fajr comes, then he must stop having intercourse as soon as he hears the adhan. If he does not do that, then he must make up the fast as well as offering the expiation.","Having intercourse when the time of Fajr comes


Hearing the adhan of Fajr while having intercourse","Praise be to Allah.Having intercourse when the time of Fajr comes
If dawn has come and he is having intercourse with his wife , then he has to stop having intercourse at once, and his fast is valid and he does not have to do anything. It is not permissible for him to carry on having intercourse after dawn has come. If he does that, then his fast is invalid and he has to make up the fast and also offer the expiation (kaffarah). 
The kaffarah is to free a slave. If that is not possible then he must fast for two consecutive months. If he is unable to do that then he must feed sixty poor persons. But this has to do with the onset of dawn. 
Hearing the adhan of Fajr while having intercourse
With regard to the adhan of the muadhdhin, if the muadhdhin gives the adhan at the time when dawn comes, then he must stop having intercourse as soon as he hears the adhan . If he does not do that, then he must make up the fast as well as offering the expiation, as stated above. 
If the muadhdhin gives the adhan before dawn comes, as some muadhdhins mistakenly do so that they will be on the safe side for fasting, as they claim, then it is permissible to continue having intercourse until he is certain that dawn has come. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked the following question: 
If a fasting person drinks something after he hears the adhan for Fajr, is his fast valid?  
He replied: 
“If the fasting person drinks something after he hears the adhan for Fajr , if the muadhdhin gives the adhan after he is certain that dawn has come, then it is not permissible for the fasting person to eat or drink anything after that. If he gives the adhan before he sees the dawn, then there is nothing wrong with eating and drinking until the dawn is seen, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and eat and drink until the white thread (light) of dawn appears to you distinct from the black thread (darkness of night).” [al-Baqarah 2:187]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Bilal gives the adhan at night, so eat and drink until you hear the adhan of Ibn Umm Maktum, for he does not give the adhan until dawn comes.” 
Hence the muadhdhins should try not to give the adhan for Fajr until they see the dawn or they are certain that it has come according to correct clocks, so that they do not  cheat the people and forbid for them something that Allah has permitted, or lead them to perform Fajr prayer before the time for it has come. This is a very serious matter indeed.” (Fatawa Islamiyyah, 1/122)

37683,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/37683,Any Du’a for Finishing (Recitation of) the Quran?,"Many Muslims during Ramadan read the Quran and upon completion of the Quran they have a du’a called ""khatm"". This is common for people from the Indian subcontinent. What I want to know is that is this du`a khatm al-Quran"" a sunnah from the Prophet? Or is it a bid’ah?
The ""khatm"" is usually by an imam, where he will recite a few du’as and read onto food which will be eaten and distributed to many people. Please could you answer this because this is also practiced when someone dies and on every Thursday evening? If there is such a hadith on this practice, please could you give me the reference?","There is no specific du’a for finishing the Quran. It is permissible for a person to make du’a as he wishes and to choose beneficial supplications. For more, see the detailed answer.","Du’a for finishing the Quran: Recommended


Is there a specific du’a for completing the Quran?


Reciting du’a over food and distributing it, and when someone dies and on Thursdays: Bid`ah?","Praise be to Allah.Du’a for finishing the Quran: Recommended
Du’a for completing the Quran in the manner asked about here is a reprehensible innovation (bid’ah), which was not done by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or by the righteous salaf (may Allah be pleased with them). If it had been something good, they would have done it before us. 
Rather what is narrated from the salaf is to make du’a after completing the Quran, without stipulating any specific du’a or any particular way of doing it. 
So if the Muslim completes reading the Noble Quran , whether in Ramadan or at other times, it is mustahabb for him to raise his hands and call upon Allah, asking Him for the best in this world and in the Hereafter. 
Is there a specific du’a for completing the Quran?
Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: 
Is there a specific du’a for completing the Quran? 
He said: 
There is no evidence that there is a specific du’a for finishing the Quran as far as I know. Hence it is permissible for a person to make du’a as he wishes and to choose beneficial supplications such as praying to be forgiven, to be granted Paradise and to be saved from Hell, seeking refuge with Allah from fitnah (temptation, tribulation), asking for help to understand the Quran in the manner that Allah is pleased with and to act upon it and memorize it, etc., because it was proven that Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) used to gather his family when he completed the Quran and make du’a.” (Majmu’ Fatawa Ibn Baz, 11/358) 
Reciting du’a over food and distributing it, and when someone dies and on Thursdays: Bid`ah?
With regard to reciting that over food and distributing it, and doing that when someone dies and on Thursdays, all of that is bid’ah (innovation).
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has commanded us to adhere to his Sunnah and the way of the Rightly-Guided caliphs, and he has forbidden us to introduce innovations into the religion. He has told us that this is misguidance, and that bid’ahs will be rejected and thrown back at the one who does them, and he will not be rewarded for them. 
Abu Dawud (4607) narrated from al-'Irbad ibn Sariyah that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever among you lives after I am gone will see great differences. I urge you to adhere to my Sunnah and the way of the Rightly-Guided caliphs. Adhere to it and cling firmly to it. And beware of newly-innovated matters, for every newly-innovated matter is a bid’ah, and every bid’ah is a going-astray.” Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud, 3851. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does any action that is not in accordance with this matter of ours (Islam) will have it rejected.” Narrated by Muslim, 1718.

“If he only loses consciousness for a few hours, then he has to fast, like the one who sleeps for a while. The fact that he loses consciousness for a few days during the day or during the night does not mean that he is not obliged to fast.” (Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 15/210)

37695,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/37695,Ruling on following the imam from the house,What is the ruling on praying at home behind the imam when the minaret of the mosque is next to the roof of the house?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Prayer offered at home behind the imam is not valid. 
It is not valid to pray with the imam who is in the mosque unless you are also inside the mosque, or you are outside the mosque but the rows are continual, such as when the mosque is full of worshippers and some of them pray outside, then their prayer is valid. 
With regard to praying outside the mosque when there is room inside the mosque to pray, this prayer is not valid. 
The Standing Committee was asked about a person who prays jamaa’ah in his house following what he can hear from the loudspeakers of the mosque, and there is no connection between the imaam and the person praying behind him, as happens in Makkah and Madeenah at the time of Hajj.  
They replied: 
This prayer is not valid. This is the view of the Shaafa’is and was also the view of Imam Ahmad, unless the rows reach his house and he can follow the imam by seeing him and hearing his voice, in which case his prayer is valid, as is the prayer of the people in rows that reach his house. But unless this condition is met, his prayer is not valid, because what the Muslim is obliged to do is to offer the prayer in congregation in the houses of Allaah (the mosques) with his Muslim brothers. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever can hear the call and does not come, there is no prayer for him, except for one who has an excuse.” Narrated by Ibn Maajah and al-Haakim; al-Haafiz said: its isnaad meets the conditions of Muslim. And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to the blind man who asked him about praying in his house, “Can you hear the call to prayer?” He said, “Yes.” He said, “Then answer it.” Narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh.
