45905,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45905,Is it permissible for a father to force his daughter to work in a mixed environment?,Can a father force his daughter to work in a mixed environment?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Working in mixed environments is not free of the risk of some 
    haraam things happening, such as looking, being alone with a person of the 
    opposite sex, or feeling attracted. Hence the scholars have issued fatwas 
    stating that it is haraam, based on what usually happens. It says in 
    Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (12/156): 
Mixing of men and women 
    in schools and elsewhere is a great evil and has serious implications for 
    people’s religious and worldly interests. It is not permissible for a woman 
    to study or work in a place where men and women mix, and it is not 
    permissible for her guardian to allow her to do that. 

    Based on that, the father has no right to force his daughter 
    to work in a mixed workplace. If he forces her to do that then she does not 
    have to obey him, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “There is no obedience in sinful matters, rather obedience 
    is only (required) in that which is good and proper.” Narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari, 7257; Muslim, 1840. 

    This daughter must explain to her father the dangers of 
    working in a mixed environment, and that it is haraam. She should remind him 
    of his duty to protect his family and save them from the Fire, and she 
    should do so in a wise manner and with beautiful preaching.

Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The scholars are unanimously agreed that if a woman who is fasting two consecutive months gets her period before completing that fast, she has to make up those days when she becomes pure, because menstruation is something that cannot be avoided during those two months unless that fast is delayed until the woman has passed menopause, but there is a risk that she may not be able to do the fast then.

45910,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45910,Should he take a riba-based loan in order to buy a house?,"We are Palestinians living in the land that was occupied in 1948. We take out mortgages from the housing ministry for a 25-year period, part of which is a gift and the other part is to be paid off in monthly installments with interest (riba). If the borrower delays paying back for one year, the ministry is entitled to take the house and sell it to someone else. There is another condition in the loan contract which states that in the event of the death of one of the spouses who signed the loan, the other is let off from paying installments and the ministry has no right to demand repayment of the loan; the house will belong fully to him or her without any further debt. What is the Islamic ruling on such loans, knowing that if a person builds a house without taking such a loan he will be asked too many questions about where he got the cash from.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    There can be no doubt that riba is a prominent feature of 
    Jewish life, and their tendency to consume haraam things in general and riba 
    in particular is well known. Allaah has mentioned that and stated that He 
    forbade that to them in the verse where He says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “For the wrongdoing of the Jews, We made unlawful for them 
    certain good foods which had been lawful for them — and for their hindering 
    many from Allaah’s Way; 
161. And their taking of Ribaa  
    (usury) though they were forbidden from taking it”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:160, 161]

    al-Haafiz Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
Allaah forbade them – 
    i.e., the Jews – to engage in riba, but they dealt in it and took it and 
    produced all kinds of tricks and devious methods to support that, and they 
    consumed the people’s wealth unlawfully. 

    Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 1/584. 

    Taking riba from you, burdening you with that and taking the 
    house away from you if you are unable to pay are all things that are well 
    known in their deviated religion and despicable dealings. The Jews have 
    restricted the text which forbids riba to dealings amongst themselves only, 
    but they say that there is nothing wrong with a Jew dealing with a non-Jew 
    on the basis of usury and they regard that as permissible. They have made 
    that a means of taking over other people’s property. 

    One of their rabbis, whose name is Raab – says: 

    If a Christian needs money, the Jew has to make the most the 
    most of this opportunity, and add usury to usury, until he has exhausted him 
    and he is unable to pay it off except by giving up all his possessions in 
    order to pray the principal and the interest. At that point the Jew should 
    seize the opportunity and by the help of the judge take control of all his 
    possessions. 

    Riba and its effects on human society 
    by Dr. ‘Umar ibn al-Ashqar, p. 31 

    Secondly: 
Riba is forbidden in 
    Islam, and it makes no difference to the ruling whether it is among Muslims 
    or between Muslims and others. Loans which stipulate that payments must be 
    made with something extra (i.e., interest) are riba-based loans and there is 
    no doubt that they are haraam. Dealing in them, taking riba or giving it all 
    expose a person to punishment in this world and in the Hereafter. 

    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Those who consume Ribaawill not stand 
    (on the Day of Resurrection) except like the standing of a person beaten by 
    Shaytaan (Satan) leading him to insanity. That is because they say: ‘Trading 
    is only like Ribaa,’ whereas Allaah has 
    permitted trading and forbidden Ribaa. So whosoever receives an 
    admonition from his Lord and stops consuming Ribaa, shall not be punished 
    for the past; his case is for Allaah (to judge); but whoever returns (to 
    Ribaa), such are the dwellers of the Fire — they will abide therein”

    [al-Baqarah 2:275]

    It was narrated that Samurah ibn Jundub (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) said: The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: Last night I saw two men who came to me and took me out to a 
    holy land. We set out until we came to a river of blood in which a man was 
    standing, and on the bank of the river there was a man with stones in front 
    of him. The man who was in the river came and wanted to get out, but the 
    other man threw a stone in his mouth and he went back to where he had been. 
    Every time he wanted to get out, he threw a stone in his mouth and he went 
    back to where he had been. I said, ‘What is this?’ He said: ‘The one whom 
    you saw in the river is the one who consumed riba.’” Narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari, 1979. 

    It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with 
    him) that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “Avoid the seven sins that doom a person to Hell.” They said: O Messenger of 
    Allaah, what are they? He said: “Shirk (associating others with Allaah), 
    witchcraft, killing a soul whom Allaah has forbidden us to kill, expect in 
    cases determined by Islamic law, consuming riba, consuming orphans’ wealth, 
    running away from the battle field, and slandering chaste, innocent 
    believing women.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2615; Muslim, 89. 

    There is no difference in the ruling between the one who 
    consumes riba (which is the bank in this case), the one who pays it (which 
    is the one who took out this loan), the one who witnesses it and the one who 
    writes it down; they are all equal in sin. 

    It was narrated that Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) cursed the one who consumes riba, the one who pays it, 
    the one who writes it down and the two who witness it, and he said: “They 
    are all the same.” 

    Narrated by Muslim, 1598. 

    The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked: 

    Is dealing with the bank riba or is it permissible? Because 
    there are a lot of citizens who borrow from the bank. 

    They replied: 

    It is haraam for the Muslim to borrow gold, silver or money 
    from someone on the basis that he will pay back more than he borrowed, 
    whether the lender is a bank or anyone else, because that is riba, which is 
    one of the worst of major sins. Any bank that deals in such transactions is 
    a riba-based bank. 

    Fataawa Islamiyyah, 2/412 
Based on this, it is not 
    permissible for you to borrow from these banks, because their dealings with 
    you come under the heading of riba which is clearly haraam. You can build 
    with your halaal money and prove that you acquired it legitimately in many 
    ways. Not everyone who builds a house without going through the bank is a 
    thief or embezzler.  There are many ways of acquiring wealth in good ways, 
    and you can prove that and document it for anyone who has doubts about you. 
    This is something that is not impossible.

     We have explained the prohibition on riba and the fact that 
    it is haraam to use it for building or buying houses in the answers to 
    questions no. 21914 and

Can a woman travel without a Mahram?


Why can’t women travel without a Mahram?


If a woman can live alone, why can’t she travel without a Mahram?","Praise be to Allah.Is a Woman Permitted to Live Alone in Islam?
A woman may live alone subject to the condition that she is trustworthy and is not a woman of dubious character. 
Can a woman travel without a Mahram?
With regard to a woman travelling without a Mahram , it is clearly not allowed, as in the Hadith narrated by Al-Bukhari (1729) and Muslim (2391) from Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No woman should travel except with a Mahram , and no man should enter upon her unless a Mahram of hers is present.” A man said: “O Messenger of Allah, I want to go out with such and such an army and my wife wants to go for Hajj .” He said: “Go out (for Hajj) with her.” 
Why can’t women travel without a Mahram?
This is completely wise, because travel involves hardship and exhaustion, and because of her weakness a woman needs someone to help her and stay by her side. Things may happen to her that may cause her to lose control when her Mahram is not with her. This is well known nowadays when there are so many accidents involving cars and other means of transportation. 
Moreover, if a woman travels alone, that exposes her to temptation and men may make approaches, especially when there is a great deal of corruption. Someone may sit near her who does not fear Allah, and he may tempt her to do something prohibited. 
If we assume that a woman is travelling alone in her car , she is exposed to other dangers, such as her car breaking down, or evil people ganging up on her, etc. 
This makes it clear that Islam is the first of all systems to take care of women, protect their honour, respect them and regard them as precious pearls that must be protected from evil. 
We submit to the command of Allah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and we know that it contains complete wisdom and mercy, because Allah only forbids to His slaves that which is harmful for them. 
If a woman can live alone, why can’t she travel without a Mahram?
It is not correct to compare travel to a woman staying alone in a house in her own town, because there are more dangers in the place that a woman travels to. If a woman is in her own town, if anything happens to her or she needs someone to help her, she will find someone to help her. The fear of evil people attacking her is less when she is in her own town and her own house than when she is travelling.

45929,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45929,Should he buy shares in a company that puts its money in the bank and pays a part of the profits?,"The scholars have said that it is permissible to buy shares that are basically halaal and are put in the riba-based banks, on the condition that 15% of the profit is paid in the public interest. 

My question is: 

Is it permissible to give that to relatives to benefit from it, such as one’s mother or siblings?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    Buying shares in companies and organizations is permissible 
    on the condition that they are trading in permissible goods and are not 
    engaging in haraam transactions. One of the greatest of haraam actions is 
    consuming riba. If one of these two conditions is broken, and the company is 
    dealing in haraam things or is manufacturing haraam things, or it is dealing 
    in riba, then buying shares is haraam and one should avoid that and find 
    something permissible. The fact that a certain percentage of the profits is 
    paid (in charity) does not make it permissible to buy those shares or make 
    that profit halaal. 

    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have 
    mercy on him) was asked about the ruling on buying shares in companies. 

    He replied: 

    Buying shares in companies is subject to further discussion, 
    because we have heard that they put their money in foreign banks, or 
    quasi-foreign banks, and take interest on it, which is a kind of riba. If 
    this is true then buying shares in them is haraam and is a major sin, 
    because riba is one of the worst of major sins. But if it is free of this 
    then buying shares is halaal, so long as there is nothing else involved that 
    is haraam according to sharee’ah. End quote.

    Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen 
    (18/question no. 119). 

    The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked: 

    Is it permissible to buy shares in companies and 
    organizations that offer their shares to the public at a time when we are 
    uncertain as to whether these companies and organizations engage in riba in 
    their dealings and we are not sure about that. Please note that we cannot be 
    sure about that, but it is what we have heard from other people. 

    They replied: 

    With regard to companies and organizations that do not engage 
    in riba or deal in haraam things, it is permissible to buy shares in them, 
    but as for those that engage in riba or any haraam things, it is haraam to 
    buy shares in them. 

    If there is uncertainty about any company, then it is safer 
    not to buy shares in them, based on the words of the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Leave that which makes you doubt for that 
    which does not make you doubt.” And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever avoids doubtful things has discharged his 
    duty and protected his religious commitment and honour.”

    21127 we quoted the fatwa of

    8590 you will find the ruling 
    on dealing in permissible shares and a warning against haraam shares. 

    Secondly: 

    If the share holder gets haraam profits from his shares, he 
    must – after taking out his share and keeping it – get rid of the money that 
    is surplus to his capital. He can spend it on charitable causes so long as 
    he does not benefit from that in any way or relieve himself of some 
    obligation or ward off some harm or wrongdoing from himself. So it is not 
    permissible for him to spend it on himself or on any of his family members 
    on whom he is obliged to spend.

“the wives of your sons who (spring) from your own loins.” [An-Nisa’ 4:23]

The evidence that the wife’s mother is a Mahram for her daughter’s husband is the verse in which Allah mentions the women who are Mahrams (interpretation of the meaning): 
“…your wives’ mothers.” [An-Nisa’ 4:23]
These three (the husband’s father, his son and the wife’s mother) become Mahrams as soon as the marriage contract is conducted, and that is not subject to the condition that the marriage be consummated. 
With regard to the wife’s daughter, she does not become a Mahram for her mother’s husband unless he has consummated the marriage with her mother, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“ and your stepdaughters under your guardianship, born of your wives to whom you have gone in — but there is no sin on you if you have not gone in them (to marry their daughters),” [An-Nisa’ 4:23]
The stepdaughter (Rabibah) is the daughter of one's wife. (See Al-Mughni, 9/514, 524)
