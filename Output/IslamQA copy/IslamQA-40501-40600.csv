40512,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/40512,"She entered ihraam for ‘umrah, then she decided not to do it. What does she have to do?","I was in al-Taa’if then I decided to go to Makkah to spend some days there. On the day I was going there, I thought of entering ihraam for ‘umrah and in fact I did ghusl and said, “Labbaayk Allaahumma bi ‘umrah, Labbayk Allaahumma labbayk (here I am, O Allaah, for ‘umrah, Here I am, O Allaah, here I am).” Then before I left the house something occurred to me that made me delay the idea. Because I am a woman, ihraam did not change a lot of things for me (i.e., my dress was no different etc), so I forgot that I had spoken the Talbiyah out loud. I went to Makkah but I did not do ‘Umrah. I spent a few days there, then I went back to al-Taa’if for one day. From there I entered ihraam for ‘umrah and I went to Makkah and did ‘umrah (and I did not remember that I had said the Talbiyah the first time until I said the Talbiyah at the meeqaat the second time). What should I do about that?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Everyone who enters ihraam for ‘Umrah or Hajj must complete 
    the rituals even if they are naafil pilgrimages, because Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And perform properly [or complete], the Hajj and ‘Umrah 
    (i.e. the pilgrimage to Makkah) for Allaah”

    [al-Baqarah 2:196]
Whoever intends to enter 
    ihraam but then does not complete the rituals, with no legitimate shar’i 
    excuse, has done something that is haraam. 
The scholars of the 
    Standing Committee said: 

    If he has put on the izaar and rida’ (ihraam garments) but he 
    did not form the intention of starting to do Hajj or ‘Umrah and he did not 
    recite the Talbiyah, then he has the choice: if he wants he may start Hajj 
    or ‘Umrah, and if he wants he can abandon the idea. And there is no sin on 
    him if he has already done the Hajj and ‘Umrah of Islam (i.e., the 
    obligatory Hajj or ‘umrah). But if he had formed the intention of starting 
    Hajj or ‘umrah, he does not have the right to cancel that and change his 
    mind, rather he must complete that for which he entered ihraam in the manner 
    prescribed in sharee’ah, because Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “And perform properly [or complete], the Hajj and ‘Umrah 
    (i.e. the pilgrimage to Makkah) for Allaah”

    [al-Baqarah 2:196]
Thus it should be clear 
    to you that once the Muslim has started Hajj or ‘umrah by forming the 
    intention, he does not have the right to change his mind, rather he must 
    complete what he has started, because of the verse quoted above – unless he 
    has stipulated a condition and this obstacle that he feared comes to pass; 
    in that case he may exit ihraam, because when Dubaa’ah bint al-Zubayr said 
    to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “O 
    Messenger of Allaah, I want to do Hajj but I am ill,” he said: “Do Hajj and 
    stipulate the condition that you will exit ihraam at the point when you 
    cannot go any further.” Saheeh – agreed upon.  

    Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah li’l-Buhooth al-‘Ilmiyyah 
    wa’l-Ifta’, 11/166-167. 

    Based on this, the ‘umrah that you did takes the place of the 
    ‘umrah for which you entered ihraam at first. 

    With regard to the things that are forbidden in ihraam that 
    you did during those days, they are forgiven, because it seems that you did 
    not know that it is forbidden to cancel the intention to do ‘umrah after 
    forming that intention. 

    In the answer to question no.
    36522 we have stated that whoever 
    does one of the things that are forbidden in ihraam out of ignorance or 
    because he forgot, does not have to do anything (i.e., he does not have to 
    offer any fidyah). 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was asked about a woman who entered 
    ihraam for ‘umrah then she canceled that ‘umrah, and did another ‘umrah a 
    few days later. Is what she did correct? What is the ruling on what she did 
    of the things that are forbidden during ihraam? 

    He replied: What she did is not correct, because if a person 
    starts to do ‘umrah or Hajj, it is haraam for him to cancel it unless he has 
    a valid shar’i reason. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And perform properly [or complete], the Hajj and ‘Umrah 
    (i.e. the pilgrimage to Makkah) for Allaah”

    [al-Baqarah 2:196]

    So this woman has to repent to Allaah for what she did, but 
    her ‘umrah is valid because even though she cancelled it, it cannot be 
    cancelled. This is one of the unique characteristics of Hajj. Hajj has 
    unique characteristics that are not present in any other act of worship. If 
    a person intends to cancel Hajj it does not become cancelled, but if a 
    person intends to cancel any other act of worship it does become cancelled. 
    If a person is fasting then he decides to cancel his fast, his fast is 
    cancelled, and if a person decides to cancel his wudoo’ whilst doing it, his 
    wudoo’ is cancelled. But if a person is doing ‘umrah and decides to cancel 
    it, it does not become cancelled, and if he decides to cancel Hajj whilst 
    putting on the Hajj garments, it does not become cancelled. Hence the 
    scholars said that the rituals of Hajj and ‘umrah do not be cancelled even 
    of a person decides to cancel them. 

    Based on this we say: this woman is still in a state of 
    ihraam from the moment she formed the intention until she completes ‘umrah. 
    Her intention to cancel it does not have any effect, rather she remains in 
    that state. 

    To sum up: with regard to this woman we say that her ‘umrah 
    is valid, but she should not cancel ihraam again, because if she cancels 
    ihraam that does not count. 
With regard to the things 
    she did that are haraam when in ihraam, let us assume that her husband had 
    intercourse with her at this time, and intercourse when in ihraam is the 
    most serious of the forbidden things. But she does not have to offer any 
    fidyah because she was unaware (of the ruling). Every person who does one of 
    the things that are forbidden in ihraam out of ignorance or because he 
    forgot or was forced to do it, does not have to do anything (i.e., offer any 
    fidyah).

40520,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/40520,Inserting fingers into the back passage,Is it permissible for a man to engage in foreplay with his wife by inserting his fingers into her back passage?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.It is permissible for each spouse to enjoy the entire body of the other, looking and touching, even the private part. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“They are Libaas [i.e. body-cover, or screen, or Sakan (i.e. you enjoy the pleasure of living with them)] for you and you are the same for them”
[al-Baqarah 2:187]
With regard to the husband engaging in foreplay with his wife in this manner, this may mean one of two things: 
Either touching the anal sphincter, or by inserting his finger into the anus. 
With regard to simply touching the anal sphincter, there is nothing wrong with that, but it is better to avoid doing that because that may lead to something else. 
With regard to inserting the finger into the anus, this should not be done, for several reasons: 
1 – The anus is the site of uncleanliness (najaasah) and faeces. 
2 – One of the reasons why anal intercourse is forbidden is so that the penis will not come into contact with unclean faecal matter; by the same token inserting the finger into the anus will make it come into unnecessary direct contact with unclean faecal matter. 
3 – This action is something that is abhorrent to the sound fitrah (innate nature of man) and offends good taste. Rather it is blind imitation of those whose fitrah is corrupt and whose tastes are nasty, who do everything that they think of to satisfy their animalistic desires with no care for good manners, morals or cleanliness, and their desires make them see something foul as something good. 
4 – Persisting in doing that may lead a person to do that which is worse than that, namely anal intercourse. This is the habit of those who follow their desires and do whatever appeals to them, so they gradually fall into more serious things because of the less serious things that they are attracted to. Thus they move step by step until they end up committing “lesser sodomy” (intercourse with a woman in her back passage). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) described that by means of a brilliant analogy when he said: “What is permissible is clear and what is forbidden is clear, and between them are dubious matters of which many people are not aware. Whoever is cautious in the dubious matters will save his religious commitment and his honour, but whoever falls into dubious matters will fall into haraam, like a shepherd who grazes his flocks around a private pasture and is liable to enter it at any moment. Every king has a sanctuary, and the sanctuary of Allaah is the things that He has forbidden. In the body there is a piece of flesh which, if it is sound, the entire body will be sound, and if it is corrupt, the entire body will be corrupt. It is the heart.”
Muslim, 4049. 
5 – What Allaah has prescribed in the relationship between husband and wife is sufficient and there is no need for anything else. Allaah has not forbidden anything except that which is harmful. 
The questioner should realize that in His complete wisdom, when Allaah forbids something (in this case, intercourse in the back passage), He also forbids the things that lead to it, because when a person does the things that lead to a haraam action, his heart becomes attached to it and finds himself torn between either doing the evil action or keeping away from it, and suffering because of that. So he does not keep away from haraam in such a way that he has peace of mind, nor does he fall into it and fulfil the desires of his evil nafs. Usually in such cases a person ends up doing what he thought that he would never do of major sins that doom a person to Hell and ruin all his affairs, both religious and worldly, and ruin his life and take away all blessings (barakah) from his wealth and children, as a result of his moving far away from his Lord and transgressing His sacred limits and not caring about the fact that Allaah is watching him in all his affairs. The wise man is the one who does not take lightly those things that lead to disaster in his religious commitment which is the capital of his wealth and comes before his worldly interests. 
The Muslim should understand the true nature of things and what they lead to. He should not be affected by what the Shaytaan makes attractive to him or think of evil actions as insignificant, lest that cause him to become one of the losers. He has to fear Allaah his Lord in secret and in public, and remember that Allaah can see him and knows his intentions and what he does, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allaah knows the fraud of the eyes, and all that the breasts conceal”
[Ghaafir 40:19]
He should remember that what is with Allaah is better and more lasting, and that the Hereafter and the delights that it contains is better for him than this world, and that the reward for being patient in refraining from evil actions is Paradise as wide as the heavens and the earth, in which is whatever the heart could desire of perfect pleasures that are free of all evils.

Can a husband prevent his wife from making Hajj?","Praise be to Allah.Asking husband’s permission for obligatory Hajj
If Hajj is obligatory for a wife and her husband tells her not to go, she may do Hajj even if her husband has not given her permission . It is not permissible for the husband to forbid her to go for the obligatory Hajj. 
Asking husband’s permission for voluntary hajj
But if it is a nafl (voluntary) Hajj, then she should not go for Hajj without her husband’s permission. 
Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (5/35): 
“A man does not have the right to forbid his wife to do the “Hajj of Islam” (i.e., the obligatory Hajj). This is the view of al-Nakha’i, Ishaq, Abu Thawr and ashab al-ra’y, and it is the correct one of the two views of al-Shafi’i. This is because it is obligatory and he has no right to forbid her to do it, as is also the case with the fast of Ramadan and the five daily prayers. But it is mustahabb for him to ask his permission for that. This was the view of Ahmad. If he gives her permission, all well and good, otherwise she may go without his permission. In the case of a voluntary Hajj, he has the right to forbid her. 
Ibn al-Mundhir said: All the scholars from whom I have learnt unanimously agreed that he has the right to forbid her from going for a voluntary Hajj. That is because the husband’s rights are binding, and she does not have the right to ignore them for something that is not obligatory.”
Can a husband prevent his wife from making Hajj?
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: If a husband forbids his wife (from going for Hajj), is he sinning? 
He replied: 
“Yes, he is sinning if he forbids his wife from going for Hajj when she has met the conditions (of it being obligatory). If she says, “Here is my mahram , he is my brother who will take me for Hajj, and I have enough money and I do not want a penny from you,” and if she has not yet performed the obligatory Hajj, then he must give her permission. If he does not, then she may go for Hajj even if he did not give permission, unless she fears that he will divorce her, in which case she is excused.” (Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 21/115)

Purpose of sports in Islam


Is bodybuilding haram in Islam?


Points to consider when practicing sports in Islam","Praise be to Allah.Islam’s care for man’s well-being
Bodybuilding aims to make the body strong and sound, which is an important and desirable goal. 
Islam is concerned with man’s well-being in both body and soul, and it encourages all kinds of sport that will strengthen the body and maintain good health as well as providing relaxation and leisure, such as swimming , shooting, horse-riding, sword-fighting and wrestling. 
Purpose of sports in Islam
But when Islam accepts sports and encourages us to engage in them, it does not make them a goal in and of themselves, rather sport is considered to be a means of protecting the sacred limits of Islam and the dignity and rights of the Muslims, in the belief that strength is one of the most important means of achieving victory and prevailing in the face of challenges and warding off the threats that face Islam.  
If the purpose of sport is to prepare the body to be fit to carry out the duty of jihad so as to make the word of Allah supreme, then sport is essential. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And make ready against them all you can of power, including steeds of war…” [al-Anfal 8:60]
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The strong believer is better and more beloved to Allah than the weak believer.” (Narrated by Muslim, 6774) 
If the aim is relaxation and maintaining good health, then sport is permissible. If it involves something haram, such as missing prayers, uncovering any part of the `awrah or mixing with women and so on, then it is haram. 
Is bodybuilding haram in Islam?
Those who engage in bodybuilding uncover their `awrah when practicing this sport, which is undoubtedly haram. The `awrah of a man extends from the navel to the knee, and it is not permissible for him to uncover it in front of anyone other than his wife. It is also not permissible for him to look at the `awrah of anyone else. 
The basic principle concerning this matter is the hadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “What is between the navel and the knee is `awrah.” Al-Albani said in Irwa al-Ghalil, 281; (it is) a good hadith. 
Points to consider when practicing sports in Islam
If the sport is free of these haram things, then there is nothing wrong with engaging in it. 
But two points should be noted:   

Some of those who engage in this sport are motivated by self-admiration and love of pride and showing off before others because of their beautiful bodies and strong muscles… and other bad motives, some of which are worse than others.  The believer should shun such things and seek the adornment of good attitude, humility and fairness. 


Going to extremes in making the body look good and being concerned with that is not a good thing. What is good in this regard is that which helps the Muslim to maintain good health, to practise Islam, to engage in jihad for the sake of Allah and to do the acts of worship which require physical strength such as Hajj. 

But doing more than that and going to extremes usually distracts the Muslim from doing things that are more important, as happens in the case of those who practise many kinds of sports nowadays, so you see them training for many hours each day. 
What benefit can a Muslim gain if his body is as strong as a bull, but his heart is devoid of faith and all virtue? 
We ask Allah to help us to do that which is good for us and will bring us happiness in this world and in the Hereafter.

It is not permissible to mix medicines with alcohol , because alcohol must be thrown away.

Can we take medicine that contains alcohol?
If the medicine is mixed with alcohol , and the percentage of alcohol is so great that this medicine is intoxicating, then it is khamr and it is haram to take it.
If the percentage of alcohol is very low and it does not intoxicate, then it is permissible to take it.

If they tell me not to do a naafil act of worship such as a voluntary fast or a naafil prayer, do I have to obey them? I resolved to perform Hajj on behalf of my maternal grandmother but my father objected and said that her children had more right to do that. Do I have to obey him in this matter?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Obedience to parents is obligatory in matters where it will 
    benefit them and not cause you any harm. But if they tell you not to do 
    naafil acts of worship, we must examine the matter further. If they need you 
    to do something and you will not be able to do it because you are 
    preoccupied with this naafil act of worship, then you should obey them, such 
    as if your father says to you, “O So and so, wait for the guests and do not 
    pray a naafil prayer.” In this case you have to obey him because there is a 
    justifiable reason for it. But if he tells you not to pray Duha because he 
    does not like such things, and he does not like naafil acts of worship 
    because he does not have strong faith, then you should not obey him. But you 
    should try to be tactful with him as much as you can, in the sense of hiding 
    the good deeds that you are doing. 

    So we say to this questioner: Do Hajj on behalf of your 
    grandmother, and if your father tells you not to, say, “It doesn’t matter” 
    and do Hajj anyway. There is no lying involved in this if you are able to 
    dissimulate. Dissimulation means saying to him, “I will not do Hajj”, 
    meaning next year. This father is telling you to sever family ties, or he is 
    ignorant. So you can tell him, “I will not do Hajj on her behalf, just to 
    please you,” meaning that you will not do Hajj on her behalf next year, 
    because you are going to do it this year.  

    Similarly some mothers, if they see that their son has a good 
    relationship with his wife, will say, “O my son, (choose) either me or her,” 
    so that he will divorce her. And some fathers may not get along well with 
    their son’s wife so they tell him to divorce her, but he should not divorce 
    her. A man asked Imam Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on him): “My father told 
    me to divorce my wife but I love her.” He said: “Do not divorce her.” The 
    man said: “When Ibn ‘Umar's father told him to divorce his wife, he asked 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about that and 
    he said, ‘Divorce your wife.’ So he told ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar to obey his 
    father and divorce his wife.’” Imam Ahmad said to him sternly: “Is you 
    father ‘Umar?!” This means something, because ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased 
    with him) only told his son to divorce his wife because he saw a legitimate 
    shar’i reason for doing so. But perhaps your father has a personal reason 
    because there is some problem between him and your wife. End quote.","Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 21/265"

40598,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/40598,Praying Maghrib behind one who is praying ‘Isha’,I came back from a journey and I had not prayed Maghrib. I entered the mosque and found them praying ‘Isha’. Should I pray ‘Isha’ with them or pray Maghrib on my own and then pray ‘Isha’?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Rather you should join the imam in the prayer, with the 
    intention of praying Maghrib, then you should sit in the third rak’ah and 
    recite the Tashahhud and say the salaam, then join the imam in what is left 
    of ‘Isha’ prayer. Or wait during the Tashahhud until the imam finishes the 
    prayer and say the tasleem with him, then pray ‘Isha’. 

    This is the view of Imam al-Shaafa’i (may Allaah have mercy 
    on him), and is one of the two views narrated from Imam Ahmad. Al-Mardaawi 
    stated in al-Insaaf (4/413) that this view was favoured by a number 
    of the companions of Imam Ahmad, including Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and 
    his grandfather al-Majd ibn Taymiyah. 

    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in 
    al-Majmoo’, 4/143: 
If he intends to pray 
    Fajr behind one who is praying Zuhr and the congregational prayer is 
    completed, if he wishes he may wait during the Tashahhud until the imam 
    finishes, and say the tasleem with him, which is better, or if he wishes he 
    may decide to leave him and say the tasleem. This leaving does not 
    invalidate his prayer, and there is no scholarly dispute on this point, 
    because he is excused from following the imam. End quote. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was 
    asked: 

    Some worshippers were delayed in praying Maghrib, and they 
    found that the imam had started to pray ‘Isha’. Should they pray Maghrib in 
    a congregation on their own, or join the imam? And how should they pray? 

    He replied: 

    The correct view is that if a person comes (to the mosque) 
    and the imam is praying ‘Isha’, whether he is with a group or not, he should 
    join the imam, with the intention of praying Maghrib. It does not matter if 
    the imam’s intention is different from that of one who is praying behind 
    him, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said: “Actions are but by intentions, and each person will have but that 
    which he intended.” If they join him in the second rak’ah, they can say the 
    tasleem with him, because they will have prayed three rak’ahs, and it does 
    not matter if they sit for the Tashahhud during their first rak’ah. If they 
    join him in the first rak’ah, then when he stands up for the fourth rak’ah, 
    they can sit and recite the Tashahhud and say the tasleem, then join him in 
    what remains of ‘Isha prayer. 

    The second opinion concerning this matter is that they should 
    join him with the intention of praying ‘Isha’, then pray Maghrib after that, 
    and the obligation to offer the prayers in order is waived because of the 
    duty to join the congregation. 

    The third view is that they should pray Maghrib on their own, 
    then join him in whatever is left of ‘Isha’ prayer. The last two views 
    involve something about which there is some reservation. The first view 
    involves neglecting the order of prayers by putting ‘Isha’ before Maghrib. 
    The second view involves having two congregations in one mosque at the same 
    time, which is dividing the ummah. 

    But the first view which we mentioned is the correct one. 
    Someone may say that there is something wrong, which is saying the tasleem 
    before the imam. In fact there is nothing wrong with this. It is narrated in 
    some places in the Sunnah that a member of the congregation may do something 
    separately from the imam, such as in the fear prayer, where the imam leads 
    them in one rak’ah, then they complete the prayer by themselves and leave. 

    Another example is the story of the man who joined Mu’aadh 
    ibn Jabal (may Allaah be pleased with him) in prayer, but when he started to 
    recite Soorat al-Baqarah or another similar soorah, he left him and did not 
    complete the prayer with him.  
And the scholars said 
    that if a man is praying in congregation then he feels that is about to pass 
    wind or that he needs to break his wudoo’ by urinating or defecating, then 
    there is no sin on him if he decides to pray alone and completes his prayer 
    and leaves. This indicates that praying alone in the case of need is not 
    regarded as wrong. End quote. 

    Liqaa’aat al-Baab il-Maftooh, 
    3/425 

    Shaykh Ibn Baaz was asked: I entered the mosque and the 
    ‘Isha’ prayer had started. Before I joined the prayer, I remember that I had 
    not prayed Maghrib. Should I pray Maghrib and then catch up with ‘Isha’ with 
    the congregation, or should I pray with the congregation and then pray 
    Maghrib afterwards? 

    He replied: if you enter the mosque and ‘Isha’ prayer has 
    started, then you remember that you did not pray Maghrib, then you should 
    join the congregation with the intention of praying Maghrib. When the imam 
    stands up for the fourth rak’ah, you should sit in the third rak’ah and 
    recite the final tashahhud – i.e., al-tahhiyaatu and the blessings 
    upon the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) – and make 
    du’aa’ after that, then wait for the imam to say the tasleem and say the 
    tasleem with him. It does not matter if the imam and the member of the 
    congregation have different intentions, according to the sound scholarly 
    opinion. If you pray Maghrib on your own and then join the congregation in 
    what is left of ‘Isha’ prayer, there is nothing wrong with that. End quote. 

    Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn Baaz, 
    12/189 
The Standing Committee 
    was asked: what should a man do if he forgets Fajr prayer, for example, and 
    does not remember until the iqaamah is given for Zuhr, or he forgets Zuhr 
    and does not remember until the time for ‘Asr begins. Should he join the 
    imam with the intention of offering the obligatory prayer that he missed or 
    with the intention of offering the prayer that is currently due, and make up 
    the missed prayer after that? 

    He replied: He should offer the prayer that he forgot behind 
    the imam, and it does not matter if his intention is different from that of 
    the imam, according to the sound scholarly opinion. End quote.
