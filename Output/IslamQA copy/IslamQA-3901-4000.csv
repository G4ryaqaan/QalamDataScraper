    is halaal and haraam ?","Assalamu a'laikum How can we make things haraam or halaal (such as smoking or avoiding tax
      or insurance) when Allah (SWT) Himself is the only One to say what is halaal and what is
      not?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Allaah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meanings):
The command (or the judgement) is for none but Allaah. He has
    commanded that you worship none but Him [Yoosuf 12:40]
And say not concerning that which your tongues put forth falsely:
    This is lawful and this is forbidden., so as to invent lies against Allaah.
    Verily, those who invent lies against Allaah will never prosper. [al-Nahl 16:116]
Say [O Muhammad, to the polytheists]: Tell me, what
    provision Allaah has sent down to you! And you have made of it lawful and unlawful.
    Say [O Muhammad]: Has Allaah permitted you (to do so) or do you invent a lie against
    Allaah? [Yoonus 10:59]It is only for Allaah to say what is halaal and
    what is haraam, because He is the Law-giver, and there is no law-giver besides Him. When
    we say that a given thing is haraam, or halaal, we refer to the evidence in the Book of
    Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).
    Whatever we find is prohibited therein, we take as haraam, and whatever we find is
    permitted, we take as halaal. We refer to the sayings of the Sahaabah (Companions of the
    Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the Taabieen (the
    generation after the Sahaabah)  may Allaah be pleased with them  and the
    commentaries of the Salaf (first generations of Islam) on the texts of the Quraan
    and Sunnah, and we refer to the sayings and ijtihaad of the scholars.
It is not permissible for us to allow or prohibit however we wish. When
    new issues come up, if we do not find a text in the Quraan or Sunnah, or in the
    sayings of the scholars of the salaf or the scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah
    wal-Jamaaah who came before us, then we have to refer to trustworthy scholars
    and people of understanding, as Allaah commands us (interpretation of the meaning): 
    so ask of those who know the Scripture [al-Nahl 16:43]. These are the
    scholars, who can do ijtihaad, examine the matter and make analogies (qiyaas) with the
    existing texts of Islam, taking into consideration the principles of necessity, and taking
    note of what is harmful to the interests of shareeah and what is beneficial, relying
    on the basic general principles of shareeah, such as the aayah (interpretation of
    the meaning),  he allows them as lawful al-tayyibaat [(i.e., all good and
    lawful things as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons, foods, etc.]
    [al-Araaf 7:157] and the hadeeth, There should be no harming nor
    reciprocating harm (reported by Ibn Maajah, 2331), and
    avoiding following whims and desires. Every evil thing that is proven to be harmful is
    haraam, and every good and beneficial thing is halaal. If it is not known that it is
    either harmful or beneficial, then the general rule is that it is permissible (mubaah).

It is not permissible for men, just as it is not permissible for women , to trim their eyebrows. Islam forbids plucking even one hair , and trimming could affect every hair, which is worse. (This was the fatwa of our Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz, when he was asked this question verbally).
But if the eyebrows are causing harm, such as falling over the eyes and preventing one from seeing properly, they may be trimmed as much as needed to remove the problem. (From a discussion of the matter with Shaykh `Abdullaah ibn Qa`ud)

This was the view of the majority of scholars, and al-Nawawi reported that there was scholarly consensus on this point. (Al-Kafi, 1/173; al-Muhadhdhab, 1/33; al-Mughni, 1/229)
Their evidence is the hadith of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) whose authenticity is agreed upon, in which she narrated that when the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wanted to sleep whilst he was in a state of impurity , he would wash his private parts and do wudu as for prayer. (Narrated by al-Jama`ah)
They also use as evidence the report narrated by Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) who said that ‘Umar said, “O Messenger of Allah, may any of us sleep when he is in a state of impurity?” He said, “yes, if he does wudu.” (Agreed upon).
The wisdom behind doing wudu is that it reduces the impurity and is better for the body.
The Zahiriyyah and Ibn Habib among the Malikis thought that it was obligatory for the person who is in a state of impurity to do wudu, on the basis of the hadith of ‘Umar referred to above.

3967,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3967,How to Distribute the Meat of the Udhiyah,How the meat of Udhiyah (sacrifice) should be shared out?,"The command to give the meat of the udhiyah in charity is reported in a number of hadiths, as was the permission to eat some and preserve some. At the very least, a third of the udhiyah should be eaten, a third should be given as gifts and a third should be given in charity.",,"Praise be to Allah.The command to give the meat of the udhiyah in charity is reported in a number of hadiths, as was the permission to eat some and preserve some.
Al-Bukhari and Muslim reported that `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “Some poor families among the people of the desert came to al-Madinah on the occasion of `Eid al-Adha at the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ‘Keep with you meat sufficient for three days, and whatever is left, give in charity.’ After that, they said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, the people made water-skins with [the hides of] their sacrificial animals , and they rendered the fat from them. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ‘What about it?’ They said, ‘You forbade us to eat the meat of our sacrificial animals after three days.’ He said, ‘I forbade you to do that because of the people who came, but now eat some and preserve some and give some in charity.’” (Reported by Muslim, 3643)
Al-Nawawi said, commenting on this hadith: 
“The phrase ‘I forbade you to do that because of the people who came’ refers to the poor Bedouin who came to Madinah, and this was so that they could be helped. ‘Rendered’ means that they melted down the fat from the animals (to be stored and used).
The phrase ‘I forbade you to do that because of the people who came, but now eat some and preserve some and give some in charity’ is a clear statement that this prohibition of keeping more than three days’ worth of meat no longer applies; it is also a commandment to eat some and to give some in charity. With regard to the portion to be given in charity, if it is a voluntary sacrifice, then giving some of it in charity is obligatory, according to the view regarded by our companions as correct. It is preferable [mustahabb] for most of it to be given in charity. They said: at the very least, a third should be eaten, a third should be given as gifts and a third should be given in charity. There is another opinion that suggests half may be eaten and half given to charity. This difference of opinion has to do with the amount that is mustahabb. With regard to the other parts of the animal, it is OK to give them in charity. As for eating from it, it is mustahabb but is not wajib (obligatory)… The majority of scholars interpreted this command (i.e., the ayah (interpretation of the meaning): ‘… eat thereof…’ [al-Hajj 22:28 and 36]) as implying encouragement or permission, especially since it came after it had been prohibited.”
Malik said: 
“There is no limit to what may be eaten or given in charity or used to feed the poor or the rich, whether one wants to give it uncooked or cooked.” (Al-Kafi, 1/424) 
The Shafi`is said that it is mustahabb to give most of it in charity, and said: “At least one third of it may be eaten , and one third given in charity, and one third given away as gifts.” They said that one half may be eaten, but it is more correct to give some of it away in charity .” (Nayl al-Awtar, 5/145; al-Siraj al-Wahhaj, 563). 
Ahmad said: 
“We go along with the hadith of ‘Abd-Allah (ibn ‘Abbas – may Allah be pleased with them both): ‘He should eat one third himself, feed one third to whomever he wants, and give one third in charity.” (Reported by Abu Musa al-Isfahani in al-Wazaif; he said it is a hasan hadith. This is also the opinion of Ibn Mas’ud and Ibn ‘Umar. No conflicting opinion is known among the Companions.” (Al-Mughni, 8/632)
The reason why there is a difference of opinion as to how much of the sacrifice may be given in charity is that there are conflicting reports, and some reports were narrated without specifying a particular amount, such as the report of Buraydah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘I had forbidden you to eat from the sacrificial meat for more than three days so that those who could afford it could give to those who are poor, but now you can eat as you wish, feed others from it, and preserve some.’” (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 1430; he said it is a sahih hasan hadith). The scholars among the Companions of the Prophet and others followed this.

3974,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3974,Can You Go to Hajj If You Have Debt?,"I have a bank loan, and very strongly I wish to go for ‘umrah. But as I know I have to finish all the loans before I can go to ‘Umrah or Hajj. Can you please tell me the proper way and limitations in Islam?","It is permissible for a person who is in debt and facing financial hardship, either because he is unable to earn money or because the creditor is absent and he cannot pay him, to go for Hajj if certain conditions are met.","Interest-based loans


Going for Hajj or paying off the debt?","Praise be to Allah.Interest-based loans
If this loan is based on riba (usury, interest) , then it is haram and is one of the major sins and one of the seven sins that doom a person to Hell. All of the nations regarded it as forbidden, even the Greeks who were idol-worshippers. One of them, whose name was Solon said: Money is like a sterile hen; a drachma cannot give birth to a drachma. 
In the Christian belief it says that one who consumes usury should not be shrouded if he dies, and even the Jews forbade usury. 
Islam has forbidden it in a manner that leaves no room for doubt concerning its prohibition.  
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allah has permitted trading and forbidden Riba. So whosoever receives an admonition from his Lord and stops consuming Riba, shall not be punished for the past; his case is for Allah (to judge); but whoever returns (to Riba), such are the dwellers of the Fire — they will abide therein.” [al-Baqarah 2:275] 
“O you who believe! Fear Allah and give up what remains (due to you) from Riba (from now onward) if you are (really) believers.” [al-Baqarah 2:278]
Abu Juhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade the price of blood, the price of a dog and the earnings of a prostitute, and he cursed the woman who does tattoos and those who have them done, the one who consumes riba (usury) and the one who pays it, and he cursed the one who makes images. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2123)
‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed the one who consumes riba and the one who pays it. (Narrated by Muslim, 1597)
Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Avoid the seven sins that doom a person to Hell.” They said, “O Messenger of Allah, what are they?” He said: “Associating others in worship with Allah (shirk); witchcraft; killing a soul whom Allah has forbidden killing, unless that is done lawfully; consuming riba (usury, interest); consuming the property of orphans; running away from the battlefield; slandering innocent, chaste, believing women.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2615; Muslim, 89)
Samurah ibn Jundub (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Last night I saw (in a dream) that two men came to me and took me out to a sacred land. They set out with me until we came to a river of blood in which a man was standing, and on the bank of the river there was a man with stones in front of him, facing the man who was in the river. Every time the man wanted to get out, the man (on the bank) threw a stone into his mouth and he went back to where he had been. I said: ‘What is this?’ They said, ‘The one whom you saw in the river is the one who consumed riba.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1979)
So you have to repent to Allah from this action. 
But if the loan was a good kind of loan that did not involve riba, there is nothing wrong with it. 
Going for Hajj or paying off the debt? 
With regard to Hajj, the person who cannot spend on himself because he is of limited means is not obliged to go for Hajj, but which of the two is more important, going for Hajj or paying off the debt? 
The most correct view is that paying off the debt is more important, because the debtor is not obliged to do Hajj, since one of the conditions of Hajj is that one should be able to do it. 
If there is a conflict between your doing Hajj and your paying off your debt , then give priority to paying off the debt . But if there is no conflict, such as there being plenty of time for you to pay off your debt, or if the person to whom you owe money is patient and can wait, then the correct view is that there is nothing wrong with your doing Hajj or ‘Umrah. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“It is permissible for a person who is in debt and facing financial hardship, either because he is unable to earn money or because the creditor is absent and he cannot pay him, to go for Hajj if someone else takes him for Hajj, provided that this does not affect his ability to pay the debt.” (Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 26/16)
All of that is subject to the condition that you are completely able to perform Hajj and that you pay off debts to anyone who asks you to pay him back when the debt becomes due, and that you are able to pay for the journey and its provisions, and whatever you need to take care of your affairs whilst you are travelling, without neglecting your family or those on whom you are obliged to spend. 
So you should leave with them enough to cover their needs. If you do not do that then you are sinning and neglecting those whom Allah has commanded you to take care of. 
Khaythamah said: “We were sitting with ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr when Qaharman came to him. He said, ‘Have you given the slaves their food?’ He said, ‘No.’ He said, ‘Go and give it to them. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “It is sufficient sin for a man if he withholds the food of his slave.”’ (Sahih Muslim, 996)
Ibn ‘Umar narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “It is sufficient sin for a man if he neglects those whom he is responsible for.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 1692)

    and another leads the prayer for a valid reason, this is permissible. This is what Ahmad
    stated…because if it is permissible for someone else to take over leading the prayer
    for a valid reason, then this applies even more so in the case of the khutbah with the
    prayer. If there is no reason, then Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: ‘I do
    not like it if there is no excuse.’ The reason why it is not liked may be because the
    Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to do both of them, and he
    said, ‘Pray as you have seen me praying’ (Reported by al-Bukhaari and Ahmad),
    and because the khutbah takes the place of two rak’ahs. The reason why it is
    permissible may be because the khutbah is separate from the prayer, as if it is two

The fact that the one who leads the prayer knows more
    Qur’aan than the khateeb is not a reason for going against the Sunnah of the khateeb
