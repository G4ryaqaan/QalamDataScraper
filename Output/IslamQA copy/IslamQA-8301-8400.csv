8301,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/8301,Who was Ibn Sayyaad? Was he the false messiah (al-maseeh al-dajjaal)?,I have read in some ahaadeeth about a strange person who appeared at the time of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). His name was Ibn Sayyaad or Ibn Saa’id. Who was this man and what was he?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Ibn Sayyaad’s name was Saafi, or ‘Abd-Allaah, ibn (the son of) Sayyaad or Saa’id. 
 He was one of the Jews of Madeenah, and it was said that he was one of the Ansaar. He was a child at the time when the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came to Madeenah. It was also said that he became Muslim.
 Ibn Sayyaad was a dajjaal (a liar), and he used to tell fortunes, sometimes what he said came true, and sometimes it did not. He became famous among the people, and it was rumoured that he was the Dajjaal. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) wanted to find out about him, so he used to go to him secretly, without revealing his identity to him, hoping to hear something from him. He also asked him some questions directly, to find out what he really was. He outlived the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), then he was lost on the day of al-Harrah. [comment deleted] 
The story of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and Ibn Sayyaad 
 ‘Abdaan told us, ‘Abd-Allaah informed us, from Yoonus from al-Zuhri, who said, Saalim ibn ‘Abd-Allaah informed me that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) informed him that ‘Umar set out with the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to look for Ibn Sayyaad, and they found him playing with some boys near the battlement of Banu Maghaalah. At that time Ibn Sayyaad was on the threshhold of adolescence. He did not notice anything until the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) struck him on the back with his hand. Then he said to Ibn Sayyaad, “Do you bear witness that I am the Messenger of Allaah?” Ibn Sayyaad looked at him and said, “I bear witness that you are the Messenger of the unlettered.” Ibn Sayyaad said to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “Do you bear witness that I am the messenger of Allaah?” He ignored that and said, “I believe in Allaah and His Messengers.” Then he asked him, “What do you see?” Ibn Sayyaad said, “(Sometimes) a truthful one comes to me and (sometimes) a liar comes.” The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “You have been confounded.” Then the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to him, “I am concealing something from you.” Ibn Sayyaad said, “It is al-dukh.” [Referring to Soorat al-Dukhaan]. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to him, “Be off with you! You will never go beyond your rank.” ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) said, “Permit me to strike his neck (kill him), O Messenger of Allaah.” The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “If he is he (the Dajjaal), then you will not be able to overpower him, and if he is not (the Dajjaal), then your killing him will not do any good.”Saalim said, I heard Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) say: After that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and Ubayy ibn Ka’b set off to go to some date-palm trees where Ibn Sayyaad was. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) concealed himself in order to hear something from Ibn Sayyaad before Ibn Sayyaad saw him. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saw him lying on his bed with a blanket around him from which was coming a murmuring sound. The mother of Ibn Sayyaad saw the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) hiding behind the trunk of the palm-tree and said, “O Saaf!” – which was his name – “Here is Muhammad  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)!” Then Ibn Sayyaad jumped up and the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “If she had left him alone, things would have been made clear.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1355). 
“Battlement” refers to a structure like a fortress. 
Maghaalah was a tribe of the Ansaar. 
The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) wanted to talk to Ibn Sayyaad without him realizing who he was. 
“from which was coming a murmuring sound” means, a low voice, or moving the lips as in speech, or speaking in an indistinct manner. 
See Fath al-Baari for the commentary on the above hadeeth in Kitaab al-Janaa’iz of Saheeh al-Bukhaari.
 ·Was Ibn Sayyaad the great Dajjaal? 
 The hadeeth quoted above – which describes some of the features of Ibn Saayaad and how the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) examined him – indicates that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not pass judgement on the matter of Ibn Sayyaad, because it was not revealed to him (by Wahy) whether he was the Dajjaal or not. 
 Many of the Sahaabah thought that Ibn Sayyaad was the Dajjaal. ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with him) swore that he was the Dajjaal in the presence of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the Sahaabah, and the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not disapprove of that. Muhammad ibn al-Munkadir said, “I saw Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah swear by Allaah that Ibn al-Saa’id was the Dajjaal. I said, ‘Do you swear by Allaah?’ He said, ‘I heard ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab swear to that effect in the presence of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not disapprove of that.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6808). 
Ibn ‘Umar told a strange story about Ibn Sayyaad which was narrated in Saheeh Muslim from Naafi’, who said: Ibn ‘Umar met Ibn Sayyaad on one of the paths of Madeenah, and said to him something which made him so angry that he swelled up and filled the road. Ibn ‘Umar went to Hafsah and told her about this. She said, “May Allaah have mercy upon you! Why did you upset Ibn Sayyaad? Don’t you know that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said that he (the Dajjaal) will emerge when something makes him very angry?” (Saheeh Muslim, 2932) 
In spite of that, when Ibn Sayyaad grew up, hetried to defend himself and said that he was not the Dajjaal; he was apparently upset by this accusation, and he quoted as evidence the fact that the attributes of the Dajjaal described by the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not apply to him.
 Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri said: “We went out for Hajj or ‘Umrah, and Ibn Saa’id was with us. We stopped at a place to camp, and the people separated and I was left with him (Ibn Saa’id). I felt very nervous and afraid of him, because of what had been said about him. He brought his luggage and put it with mine. I said, ‘It is very hot – why don’t you put your things under that tree?’ So he did that. Then some sheep appeared before us, and he went and brought a large vessel (of milk) and said, ‘Drink, O Abu Sa’eed.’ I said, ‘It is too hot, and the milk is hot.’ In fact (the only thing wrong was) that I did not want to drink from his hand, or take anything from his hand. He said, ‘Abu Sa’eed, I have been thinking that I should take a rope and suspend it from a tree, and hang myself, because of what people are saying about me. O Abu Sa’eed, does anyone know more about hadeeth than you Ansaar? Are you not one of the most knowledgeable of people about the hadeeth of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)? Didn’t the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say that the Dajjaal is a kaafir, and I am a Muslim? Didn’t the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say that he would be sterile, with no children, and I have left my child behind in Madeenah? Didn’t the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say that he will never enter Madeenah or Makkah, but I have left Madeenah and am headed for Makkah?’ … I was about to accept his excuses, then he said, ‘But, by Allaah, I know who the Dajjaal is, where he was born and where he is now.’ I said to him, ‘May you perish for the rest of the day!’” (Narrated by Muslim, no. 5211). 
 According to another report, Ibn Sayyaad said: “By Allaah, I know where he is now and I know his father and mother.” It was said to him, “Would you not be happy to be that man?” He said, “If it were offered to me, I would not refuse.” (Narrated by Muslim, 521) 
 The scholars were confused by the reports about Ibn Sayyaad. Some scholars said that he was the Dajjaal, and others said that he was not. Both groups had evidence (daleel) for what they said, and their views conflicted a great deal. Ibn Hajar tried to reconcile the two views by saying: the best way in which we may reconcile what is said in the hadeeth of Tameem al-Daari and the view that Ibn Sayyaad was the Dajjaal is to say that the Dajjaal is the exact same person whom Tameem al-Daari saw chained up, and that Ibn Sayyaad was a shaytaan (a devil) who appeared in the image of the Dajjaal at that time, until he went to Isfahaan, where he hid with his qareen, until the appointed time comes when Allaah will decree that he should emerge. Because the matter is so confusing, al-Bukhaari, instead of attempting a reconciliation, narrated the hadeeth of Jaabir from ‘Umar, believing it to be more saheeh, and did not narrate the hadeeth of Faatimah bint Qays about the story of Tameem. (Fath al-Baari, 13/328)
It was said that Ibn Sayyaad was one of the dajjaals or liars, but he was not the greater Dajjaal. And Allaah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
8341,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/8341,Is Wearing Red Haram in Islam?,I've heard that it's wrong for men to wear red. Is this true?,"It is permissible to wear red clothes if the red is combined with another colour; it is not permissible to wear plain red, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade doing so.","Can men wear red?


How to reconcile between hadiths about wearing red clothes?


The hadiths which forbid wearing plain red 


Hadiths which permit wearing red if it is mixed with another colour","Praise be to Allah.Can men wear red?
The scholars differed concerning the ruling on men wearing red clothes, and different hadiths have been narrated concerning that. Some hadiths indicate that wearing red is forbidden, whilst others indicate that it is permitted. 
How to reconcile between hadiths about wearing red clothes?
It is possible to reconcile between them – praise be to Allah – because the hadiths do not contradict with one another in fact, as the source is one. The correct view concerning this matter is that the hadiths can be reconciled in the following manner:
It is permissible to wear red clothes if the red is combined with another colour; it is not permissible to wear plain red, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade doing so.
The hadiths which forbid wearing plain red 
There follows a discussion of some of the hadiths on this issue:

The hadiths which forbid wearing plain red.


From al-Bara ibn ‘Azib (may Allah be pleased with him): “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade us to use soft red mattresses and qasiy – garments with woven stripes of silk.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5390)
From Ibn 'Abbas, who said: “I was forbidden (to wear) red garments and gold rings, and to recite Quran in ruku’.” (Narrated by al-Nasai, no. 5171. Imam al-Albani said: its isnad is sahih. Sahih Sunan al-Nasai, 1068
From ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-As (may Allah be pleased with them both), who said: “A man passed by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wearing two red garments and greeted him with salam, but he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not return the greeting.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, no. 2731; Abu Dawud, no. 3574. Al-Tirmidhi said: this hadith is hasan gharib with this isnad). According to the scholars, the meaning of this hadith is that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) disliked the wearing of garments dyed with safflower (the red dyestuff obtained from safflowers), but he had no objection to garments dyed with clay or other substances, so long as it was not dyed with safflower. This hadith was classed as da’if by al-Albani (Da’if Sunan Abi Dawud, 403; Da’if Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 334. He said: its isnad is weak).

Hadiths which permit wearing red if it is mixed with another colour

Hadiths which may be understood to mean that it is permissible to wear red if it is mixed with another colour:


From Hilal ibn ‘Amir from his father, who said: “I saw the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in Mina, giving a khutbah sitting on his mule, wearing a red cloak, and ‘Ali was in front of him, repeating what he said (in a loud voice, so that the people could hear).” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, no. 3551; classed as sahih by al-Albani – Sahih Sunan Abi Dawud, 767).
The hadith of al-Bara ibn ‘Azib (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was of average build. I saw him in a red hullah, and I never saw anyone more handsome than him (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, no. 5400; Muslim, 4308).
From al-Bara, who said: “I never saw anyone who has hair wearing a red hullah and looking more handsome than the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). He had hair down to his shoulders, he was broad-shouldered and was neither short nor tall.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, no. 1646. He said: in this chapter there is a report from Jabir ibn Samurah and Abu Rimthah and Abu Juhayfah. This hadith is hasan sahih…)
From al-Bara who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had hair down to his earlobes. I saw him wearing a red hullah, and I have never seen anyone more handsome than him.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, no. 4072; Ibn Majah, no. 3599. Classed as sahih by al-Albani – Sahih Sunan Abi Dawud, 768).
Al-Bayhaqi narrated in al-Sunan: “[The Prophet] (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to wear a red cloak on ‘Eid.”

 What is meant by a red hullah is a suit of two Yemeni garments which are woven with red and black stripes, or red and green stripes. It is described as red because of the red stripes in it. 
This is the view of a number of scholars, such as al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (Fath al-Bari Sharh ‘ala Sahih al-Bukhari, no. 5400) and Ibn al-Qayyim (Zad al-Ma’ad, 1-137).

8375,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/8375,Collecting donations to give gifts to poor families at Christmas,"In my school it is Christmas time. My school has this Christmas tradition. Every year a classroom gets an adopted family that is poor so they can buy gifts, food, and donate money to them for Christmas. Unfortunately, I have refused to donate any money or give any food for the following reason: -These denotations will be done in the name of christmas, so that when the adopted family receives these donations, they will say ""God Bless The Christians"".
Am I right for refusing to give donations?",,,"Praise be to Allah.It seems that you are referring to the birth of the Messiah (peace be upon him), an occasion which the Christians venerate and have taken as a festival. The festivals of the Christians are part of their religion, and if the Muslims venerate the festivals of the kuffaar by expressing joy and giving gifts, this means that they are imitating them. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.” Muslims must beware of imitating the Christians in their festivals and of following the customs that belong only to them. You did well and you did the right thing when you did not agree to collect donations for poor families on the occasion of Christmas, so adhere to that and advise your brothers and explain to them that this action is not permissible, because we Muslims have no festivals apart from Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adhaa. Allah has given us these two festivals and we have no need of the festivals of the kaafirs.
 Written by Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Barraak.
 If we Muslims want to give in charity, we can give to those who really deserve it, and we should not aim to do that specifically on the days of the kaafirs’ festivals. We should do that whenever there is a need, and make the most of good and great occasions such as the month of Ramadaan and the first ten days of Dhu’l-Hijjah, and other virtuous occasions when rewards are multiplied. We should also do that at times of hardship, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
 “But he has not attempted to pass on the path that is steep (i.e. the path which will lead to goodness and success).
And what will make you know the path that is steep?
(It is) freeing a neck (slave)
Or giving food in a day of hunger (famine),
To an orphan near of kin.
Or to a Miskeen (poor) cleaving to dust (out of misery).
Then he became one of those who believed (in the Islamic Monotheism) and recommended one another to perseverance and patience, and (also) recommended one another to pity and compassion.

I do not know how many times I committed the sin of masturbation and oral sex. Even in this very blessed month of Ramadan. I am in the verge of loosing all hopes for forgiveness. I have heard that he who does not get forgiveness in this month of Ramadan(i.e. get the Jannah) should be destroyed.(According to an authentic hadeeth). Since I have committed this sin in this Ramadan too now I am completely devastated in my hopes. Could you please tell me what to do to repent sincerely? If Allah the Exalted so wills I really would like to be forgiven for my cursed deeds. Is there any way to get at least some of the signs that I have been forgiven? How can stay away from this sins? I repent so many times but again I go back to the sin. That means I am not repenting sincerely. I wanted to get married but my parents(from indian subcontinent) does not allow me yet. I can not blame them because according to islamic law I can not hurt them or can not talk over them. So I have to oblige them. But here in the US I can not control myself. I know these gravest sins and I have committed them countless times. By the will of the Exalted I do a very good job. Is this another sign that the Exalted has cursed me by increasing my wealth so that I can delve into the sins more? Now I would like to repent. I would like to repent. I would like to repent. I would like to repent and go back to my Rabb(Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala) and never want to go back to those sins again.

Hence it is the Shaytaan who is making you think that you cannot repent, and what is there that is stopping you from repenting?
 But you have to follow the means which will help you to keep away from this sin. One of the most important things in this regard is marriage. If you cannot marry, then follow the advice given by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), which is to fast. Try to fast some of the days when it is mustahabb (recommended) to fast, such as Mondays and Thursdays, or three days of every month. Keep away from things which will provoke your desire, such as looking at haraam things or at scenes which will provoke your desire or thinking about your desires. Keep your thoughts busy with things that will be of benefit to you, and look for a righteous companion (wife) to help you to adhere to the path of obedience.
 As for your good job, it has nothing to do with this. It may be the case that Allaah enables a righteous man to find a good job which He denies to a sinful man. Provision is in the Hand of Allaah, may He be blessed and exalted, and He may test some of His slaves with ample provision or with straitened circumstances.
 The sign that your repentance has been accepted is that you give up that sin and never go back to it. Since you missed out on repentance during Ramadaan, strive hard to achieve it at other times.

How often is it carried out and in what countries is it most common?,"If a Muslim woman marries a non-Muslim when she knows the ruling, then she is an adulteress, and her punishment is the punishment for adultery. If she was ignorant of the ruling, then she is excused but they must be separated.","Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?


Punishment for marrying a non-Muslim man","Praise be to Allah.Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
It is not permissible for a Muslim woman to marry a non-Muslim , whether he is Jewish, Christian or an idol-worshipper. This is because the man has authority over his wife, and it is not permissible for a non-Muslim to have authority over a Muslim woman. For Islam is the true religion and all other religions are false. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And give not (your daughters) in marriage to Al-Mushrikun till they believe (in Allah Alone).” [al-Baqarah 2:221]
“And never will Allah grant to the disbelievers a way (to triumph) over the believers.” [al-Nisa 4:141]
 And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Islam should prevail and should not be prevailed over.”
Punishment for marrying a non-Muslim man
If a Muslim woman marries a non-Muslim when she knows the ruling, then she is an adulteress, and her punishment is the punishment for adultery. 
If she was ignorant of the ruling, then she is excused but they must be separated, and there is no need for a divorce because the marriage is null and void. 
On this basis, the Muslim woman whom Allah has honoured with Islam and her guardian must beware of that and must adhere to the limits set by Allah, and they must feel proud of Islam. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Those who take disbelievers for Awliya (protectors or helpers or intimate friends) instead of believers, do they seek honour, power and glory with them? Verily, then to Allah belongs all honour, power and glory,” [al-Nisa 4:139]

8399,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/8399,Is there a difference between modern tafseer of the Qur’aan and ancient tafseer?,Are there differences in the interpretation of the Qur'an and in related ceremonies between the early time of the islam (up to the Umayyads) and today ?,,,"Praise be to Allah.If what is meant in the question is the tafseer of the Qur’aan during the Umawi (Umayyad) period at the time of the righteous salaf (predecessors) of the Taabi’een and the successive generation, and the lesser Sahaabah, the compilation (of tafseer) in written form was not widespread at that time, compared to later times. It is mostly limited to reports which are known as al-tafseer al-athari (reports quoting the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the Sahaabah).Then the scholars adopted other appraoches in tafseer and followed a number of trends, some of which were praiseworthy and acceptable, and others were to be rejected. In more recent times, this reliance on their own opinions and understanding was taken even further, and theories and variables which have no place in tafseer were forcibly introduced. It reached the point where it may be said of some tafseers that they contain everything except tafseer. Examples of this in mediaeval tafseers include Tafseer al-Raazi, and in modern tafseers, Tafseer al-Jawaahir.
One of the good references on this is Ittijaahaat al-Tafseer fi’l-Qarn al-Raabi’ ‘ashar by Shaykh Fahd al-Roomi",Written by Shaykh ‘Abd al-Kareem al-Khudayr
