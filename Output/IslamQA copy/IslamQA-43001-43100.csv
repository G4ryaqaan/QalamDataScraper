43010,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/43010,He only fasts Ramadan and does not observe any naafil fasts,What is the ruling on one who only fasts in Ramadan and does not fast on other occasions? Is it permissible for me to give charity?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.What the Muslim is obliged to do is to fast Ramadan. It is not obligatory to fast on other occasions, such as ‘Arafah and 'Ashura, unless one has vowed to do so. If one has not made such a vow then it is not obligatory. 
It was narrated that Talhah ibn ‘Ubayd-Allah said: A man from the people of Najd came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) with unkempt hair. We could hear him shouting but we could not understand what he was saying until he came close, and he was asking about Islam. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Five prayers every day and night.” He said: “Do I have to do anything else?” He said: “No, unless you do it voluntarily.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “And fasting Ramadan.” He said: “Do I have to do anything else?” He said: “No, unless you do it voluntarily.” And the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told him about zakaah. He said: “Do I have to do anything else?” He said: “No, unless you do it voluntarily.” The man went away, saying, “By Allah, I will do no more than this and no less.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “He will succeed, if he means it.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 46; Muslim, 11. 
This indicates that the fasting that is obligatory is fasting in the month if Ramadan. With regard to fasting on other occasions, it is not a sin if one does not do it. 
Al-Nawawi said in Sharh Muslim: 
This hadeeth indicates that it is not obligatory to fast 'Ashura and other occasions, apart from Ramadan. There is consensus on this point. 
But we should not ignore fasting on other occasions such as 'Ashura, ‘Arafah, six days of Shawwaal and so on, because of the great reward that this brings and the great status it has. Moreover observing naafil fasts makes up for any shortfall that there may be in the obligatory fasts. 
It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “The first of his deeds for which a person will be brought to account on the Day of Resurrection will be his prayer. If it is sound he will have succeeded, and if it is lacking he will be a loser. If anything is lacking from his obligatory prayers, the Lord will say, ‘Look and see if My slave has any voluntary prayers, and use them to make up what is lacking from his obligatory prayers.’ Then all his deeds will be dealt with in like manner.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, no. 413; al-Nasaa’i no. 465. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
This indicates that observing naafil fasts will make up for any lack in the obligatory fasts. 
 With regard to your question about charity, it is not clear, but if you meant to ask about giving charity to such a man (one who only fasts in Ramadan), the answer is: yes, it is permissible to give him charity, so long as he is a Muslim who prays. The fact that he does not observe naafil fasts is not a sin. And Allah knows best.",Islam Q&A
43012,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/43012,Allaah is Severe in punishment,"One of my friends listens to music. When he is given advice, he responds by saying that Allaah is Forgiving and Most merciful, but I tell him that Allaah is Severe in punishment. I would like some evidence from the Sunnah and Qur’aan that Allaah is Severe in punishment.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The questioner is to be appreciated for his keenness to guide his friend. Friends should be keen to advise and guide their brothers, without worrying about their reaction or getting tired. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The believers, men and women, are Awliyaa’ (helpers, supporters, friends, protectors) of one another; they enjoin (on the people) Al-Ma‘roof (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do), and forbid (people) from Al-Munkar (i.e. polytheism and disbelief of all kinds, and all that Islam has forbidden); they perform As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as-Salaah), and give the Zakaah, and obey Allaah and His Messenger. Allaah will have His Mercy on them. Surely, Allaah is All-Mighty, All-Wise”
[al-Tawbah 9:71]
Secondly: the majority of scholars are of the view that music is haraam, as is indicated by a great deal of evidence from the Qur’aan and Sunnah. This was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas, Ibn Mas’ood, al-Shu’bi, al-Thawri and other scholars. 
See Sunan al-Bayhaqi, 10/223; al-Muhalla, 9/59; al-Mughni, 14/160 
See also question no.  5000 
Thirdly: there are many verses and hadeeths which speak of the severity of Allaah’s punishment. These texts may be divided into two categories: 
1 – Those which deal directly with music 
2 – Those which speak of the severity of Allaah’s punishment in general 
With regard to the first category, a number of hadeeths have been narrated concerning this. 
It was narrated that Anas ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Two sounds are cursed in this world and the Hereafter: flutes (musical instruments) at times of joy and wailing at times of sorrow.” Narrated by al-Bazzaar and al-Diya’ al-Maqdisi in al-Ahaadeeth al-Mukhtaarah; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Tahreem Alaat al-Tarb, p. 51. 
Being cursed means being cast out far from the mercy of Allaah. 
Al-Tirmidhi narrated (2138) from ‘Imraan ibn Husayn that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Among this ummah will be (people who will be) swallowed up by the earth, transformed into pigs and monkeys, and pelted with stones from above.” A man among the Muslims said, “O Messenger of Allaah, when will that be?” He said: “When female singers and musical instruments appear, and wine is drunk.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
With regard to the second category: In the Qur’aan Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Ward off yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones, over which are (appointed) angels stern (and) severe, who disobey not, (from executing) the Commands they receive from Allaah, but do that which they are commanded”
[al-Tahreem 66:6] 
“The Day they will be dragged on their faces into the Fire (it will be said to them): Taste you the touch of Hell!”
[al-Qamar 54:48] 
“But if you do it not, and you can never do it, then fear the Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones”
[al-Baqarah 2:24] 
“When iron collars will be rounded over their necks, and the chains, they shall be dragged along,
72. In the boiling water, then they will be burned in the Fire”
[Ghaafir 40:71-72] 
“and every obstinate, arrogant dictator (who refuses to believe in the Oneness of Allaah) was brought to a complete loss and destruction.
16. In front of him (every obstinate, arrogant dictator) is Hell, and he will be made to drink boiling, festering water.
17. He will sip it unwillingly, and he will find a great difficulty to swallow it down his throat, and death will come to him from every side, yet he will not die and in front of him, will be a great torment”
[Ibraaheem 14:15-17] 
“Verily, the tree of Zaqqoom
44. Will be the food of the sinners.
45. Like boiling oil, it will boil in the bellies,
46. Like the boiling of scalding water.
47. (It will be said:) Seize him and drag him into the midst of blazing Fire,
48. Then pour over his head the torment of boiling water.
49. Taste you (this)! Verily, you were (pretending to be) the mighty, the generous!”
[al-Dukhaan 44:43-49] 
“then as for those who disbelieved, garments of fire will be cut out for them, boiling water will be poured down over their heads.
20. With it will melt (or vanish away) what is within their bellies, as well as (their) skins.
21. And for them are hooked rods of iron (to punish them).
22. Every time they seek to get away therefrom, from anguish, they will be driven back therein, and (it will be) said to them: Taste the torment of burning!”
[al-Hajj 22:19-22] 
In the Sunnah, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Hell will be brought on the Day of Resurrection with seventy thousand reins, each of which will be held by seventy thousand angels, dragging it along.” Narrated by Muslim, 2842. 
And he said: “This fire of yours which is lit by the sons of Adam is one seventieth part of the fire of Hell.” They said: “By Allaah, if it was like this that would be sufficient.” He said: “It is sixty-nine times worse than that, each time as hot as this (worldly fire).” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3265; Muslim, 2843. 
And he said: “Allaah has promised that whoever drinks intoxicants, He will give him to drink of the mud of khabaal.” They said: “O Messenger of Allaah, what is the mud of khabaal?” He said: “The sweat of the people of Hell” or “The juices of the people of Hell.” Narrated by Muslim, 2002. 
And he said: “If a drop of Zaqqoom were to fall in this world, it would destroy the livelihood of the people of this world, so how about the one whose food it is?” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2585; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 5126. 
And he said: “The most lightly punished person in Hell will have two sandals and laces of fire because of which his brains will boil like a cauldron. He will not think that anyone else is more severely punished than him, but he will be the most lightly punished.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6562; Muslim, 213. 
And he said: “The man from among the people of Hell who lived the most luxurious life in this world will be brought and dipped in the Fire, then it will be said to him, ‘O son of Adam, have you ever seen anything good, have you ever enjoyed any pleasure?’ and he will say, ‘No, by Allaah, O Lord.’” Narrated by Muslim, 2707. 
And he said: “If there were in this mosque one hundred thousand or more, and there was among them a man from the people of Hell and he breathed out and his breath touched them, the mosque and everyone in it would be burned.” Narrated by al-Bazzaar; classed a saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Targheeb, 3668. 
Ibn al-Qayyim said in al-Jawaab al-Kaafi, p. 53-68: 
Many ignorant people rely on the mercy of Allaah and His forgiveness and kindness, and they ignore His commands and prohibitions, and forget that He is severe in punishment and He does not ward off His wrath from evildoers. Whoever relies on His forgiveness whilst persisting in sin is like one who is stubborn.  
One of the scholars said: If Allaah has decreed that the hand is to be cut off  for stealing three dirhams, then do not feel safe from His punishment in the Hereafter.  
It was said to al-Hasan: “We see that you weep a great deal.” He said: “I am afraid lest Allaah throws me in the Fire and does not care about me.”  
And he used to say: “Some people indulged in wishful thinking about forgiveness until they departed this world without having repented, and they would say: ‘I think positively of my Lord,’ but he was lying. If he had thought positively about his Lord, he would have done good deeds. 
Then he mentioned some of the hadeeths which speak of the severity of Allaah’s punishment, then he said: 
There are far more hadeeths on this subject than we can mention. The one who is sincere should not ignore them and give himself free rein to commit sin and depend on his hope and positive thoughts about Allaah.”.",Islam Q&A
43017,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/43017,Repented From Stealing But Unable to Return Stolen Property,"I am a nineteen-year-old girl. I had the habit of stealing when I was fourteen years old, and this matter is tormenting me a great deal now, after repenting, because I know that my repentance will not be accepted unless I give back to the people what is rightfully theirs, but I do not have enough money to do that. What should I do? I hope that you will help me so that my repentance will be accepted.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    
    Firstly: You should realize that the mercy of Allah is greater than anyone 
    can imagine. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    
    
    “... and My Mercy embraces all things.”

    
    [al-A’raf 7:156] 

    
    And it was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that 
    the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: 
    “Allah has one hundred degrees of mercy, of which He sent down one among the 
    jinn, mankind, the animals and the vermin, by virtue of which they show 
    compassion and mercy to one another, and the wild animal shows compassion to 
    its young. But Allah has kept behind ninety-nine degrees of mercy by virtue 
    of which He will have mercy on His slaves on the Day of Resurrection.” 
    Narrated by Muslim, 2752. 

    
    A person repented from killing one hundred souls, as was narrated in the 
    saheeh hadeeth (authentic narration) from the Messenger of Allah (peace and 
    blessings of Allah be upon him) (narrated by Muslim, 2766), and stealing is 
    not more serious than killing. So congratulations for your repenting and 
    turning to Allah. 

    
    Secondly: The scholars stated that there are three conditions for 
    repentance: giving up the sin, regretting what is past, and resolving not to 
    go back to it. 

    
    You should understand that rights are of two types: the rights of Allah and 
    the rights of other people. The rights of Allah are waived when one repents, 
    except in the case of financial dues such as zakah (poor-due), kaffarah 
    (expiation) and vows – according to the correct opinion. 

    
    See Rawdat al-Talibeen, 11/246; Kashshaf al-Qina’, 2/257. 

    
    With regard to the rights of other people, the scholars added a fourth 
    condition to repentance, which is that people’s rights should be restored to 
    them, and that repentance is not sufficient to waive any of the rights owed 
    to others, rather the rights of the one who has been wronged must be 
    restored. 

    
    This was mentioned by Ibn Qudamah, al-Nawawi, Ibn al-Qayyim, Ibn Hajar and 
    others. See: al-Mughni, 14/193; Rawdat al-Talibeen, 
    11/245-246; Madarij al-Salikeen, 1/396; Fath al-Bari, 11/104. 

    
    Thirdly:  What you mention about not being able to return the money is no 
    justification for taking this matter lightly. Try to collect the money from 
    halal (lawful) sources such as gifts, work that is Islamically acceptable, 
    and so on. Allah will help you with that if He knows that you are sincere, 
    as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    
    
    “And whosoever fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for 
    him to get out (from every difficulty).

    
    And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine.”

    
    [al-Talaq 65:2-3] 

    
    Then give this money to its rightful owner and tell them frankly, if that 
    will not cause embarrassment or lead to harmful consequences; if being frank 
    will cause too much embarrassment, then you can give it to them in a way 
    that will not cause any trouble between you and them. See question no.
    
    
    
    45016. 

    
    If you cannot return the money because the amount is too great and you 
    cannot afford it, then you can ask the owners to forgive you. Seek the help 
    of Allah in this and put your trust in Him. 

    
    
    “And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him.”

    
    [al-Talaq 65:3] 

    
    If you cannot do that either because you do not know who the owner is, for 
    example, then we hope that Allah will forgive you. 

    
    Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If the sin has to do with 
    financial duties, such as withholding zakah, seizing property by force and 
    crimes against people’s wealth, then as well as that (repentance) the duty 
    must also be discharged, such as paying zakah, returning people’s wealth to 
    them if it is still present or paying them the equivalent otherwise, or 
    asking the person to whom it is owed to let him off. If the person has died, 
    then it should be given to his heir; if he does not have an heir or he 
    cannot be found, then the matter should be referred to a qadi (judge) of 
    good character.  

    
    If this is not possible, then it should be given in charity to the poor with 
    the intention of also paying it back if he (the one who took it) finds him; 
    if he is poor then he should have the intention of paying it back if he can. 
    If he dies before he can pay it back, then there is the hope that Allah will 
    forgive him by His grace. 

    
    
    Rawdat al-Talibeen, 
    11/246.

43021,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/43021,Nothing exists except by the will and decree of Allaah,What things affect Qadr (what has already been written for us)?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Nothing exists except by the will and decree of Allaah, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“No calamity befalls on the earth or in yourselves but it is inscribed in the Book of Decrees (Al Lawh Al Mahfooz) before We bring it into existence. Verily, that is easy for Allaah”
[al-Hadeed 57:22]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The pens have been lifted and the pages have dried.” Narrated and classed as saheeh by al-Tirmidhi (2516), from the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas.
Al-Mubaarakfoori said:
“The pens have been lifted and the pages have dried” means, What has been decreed has been written in al-Lawh al-Mahfooz (the Book of Decrees), and nothing else will be written after that is finished.
Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi, 7/186
The writing is of two types: one kind which cannot be altered or changed, which is what is in al-Lawh al-Mahfooz, and a type which may be altered or changed, which is in the hands of the angels. And the ultimate outcome is what is written in al-Lawh al-Mahfooz. This is one of the meanings of the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning):
“Allaah blots out what He wills and confirms (what He wills). And with Him is the Mother of the Book (Al Lawh Al Mahfooz)”
[al-Ra’d 13:39]
Hence we can understand what was narrated in the Sunnah, that upholding family ties increases one’s lifespan or increases one’s provision; or that du’aa’ can alter the divine decree. For Allaah knows whether His slave will uphold the ties of kinship or make du’aa’, so He writes in al-Lawh al-Mahfooz that this person will have more provision or a longer life span.
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah was asked:
Can provision increase or decrease? Is provision what a person eats or possesses?
He replied:
Provision is of two types:
1 – That which Allaah knows He will provide, which cannot be changed.
2 – That which He has prescribed and told to the angels. This may increase or decrease depending on causes. If Allaah commands the angels to write provision for a person if he upholds the ties of kinship, Allaah will increase his provision because of that. It was proven in al-Saheeh that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever would like his provision to be increased and his life span to be extended, let him uphold the ties of kinship.” Similarly the life span of Dawood was extended by sixty years and Allaah made it one hundred years, after it was originally forty. This is as ‘Umar said: “O Allaah, if you have decreed that I am to be doomed, then erase that and make me one of those who are to be blessed, because You blot out whatever You will and confirm whatever You will.” Similarly Allaah said of Nooh (interpretation of the meaning):
“That you should worship Allaah (Alone), fear (be dutiful to) Him, and obey me,
He (Allaah) will forgive you of your sins and respite you to an appointed term”
[Nooh 71:3-4]
And there is a great deal of corroborating evidence. The means of acquiring provision comes under the heading of that which Allaah has decreed. If it has been decreed that a person will earn his provision by means of his work and efforts, then Allaah will cause him to work and strive, and that which is decreed for him by means of his work will not come to him without him working to earn it. And what has been decreed for him without his having to earn it, such as an inheritance, will come to him without him working for it.
Work or striving is of two types: striving in work for the sake of earning a living, such as industry, farming and business; and striving in du’a’, putting one's trust in Allaah, treating others kindly, and so on. Allaah will help His slave so long as His slave helps his brother.

43028,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/43028,Intercourse During Periods and Post-Natal Bleeding: Why Is It Prohibited?,"What is the wisdom behind the prohibition on having intercourse with one's wife when she is menstruating or bleeding following childbirth? 
If the reason for the prohibition is the blood because it is impure, then is it permissible to have intercourse using a barrier like a condom?","Sex during periods is prohibited not just because of the blood, rather it is for many reasons as stated in the detailed answer below.","Prohibition of sex during periods 


Scientific studies prove the harm of having intercourse during period","Praise be to Allah.Prohibition of sex during periods 
Allah has forbidden men to have intercourse with their wives in the vagina at the time of menstruation. 
The Quran clearly stated the reason for this prohibition, which is that menstruation is adha (a harmful thing). Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“They ask you concerning menstruation. Say: that is an Adha (a harmful thing for a husband to have sexual intercourse with his wife while she is having her menses), therefore, keep away from women during menses.” [al-Baqarah 2:222] 
Scientific studies prove the harm of having intercourse during period  
Scientific studies in this field have disclosed to us some of the harm that is referred to in this verse, but they have not managed to describe all the harms that are referred to in the Quranic text. 
Dr. Muhiy al-Din al-‘Alabi said: 
“It is essential to refrain from having intercourse with a menstruating woman because doing so leads to an increase in the flow of menstrual blood, because the veins of the uterus are congested and prone to rupture, and get damaged easily; and the wall of the vagina is also susceptible to injury, so the likelihood of inflammation is increased, which leads to inflammation in the uterus and in the man’s penis, because of the irritation that occurs during intercourse. Having intercourse with a menstruating woman may also be off-putting to both the man and his wife, because of the presence and smell of blood, which may make the man impotent (i.e., uninterested in sex).” 
Dr. Muhammad al-Bar said, speaking of the harm that may be caused to the menstruating woman: 
“The lining of the uterus is shed during menstruation, and the uterus is scarred as a result, just like when the skin is flayed. So it is vulnerable to bacteria and the introduction of the bacteria that are to be found at the tip of the penis poses a great danger to the uterus.  
Hence the penetration of the penis into the vagina at the time of menstruation is no more than the introduction of germs at a time when the body is unable to fight them.” 
Dr. al-Bar thinks that the harm is not limited to what he describes of the introduction of germs into the uterus and vagina which is difficult to treat, rather it also extends to other things, namely: 

The spread of infection to the fallopian tubes, which may then become blocked, which in turn may lead to infertility or ectopic pregnancy, which is the most dangerous kind of pregnancy.
The spread of infection to the urethra, bladder and kidneys; diseases of the urinary tract are usually serious and chronic.
Increase of germs in the menstrual blood, especially gonorrhea germs. 

The menstruating woman is also in a physical and psychological state that is not conducive to intercourse, so if it takes place it will harm her a great deal and cause her pains during her period, as Dr. al-Bar said: 

“Menstruation is accompanied by pains, the severity of which varies from one woman to another. Most women experience pains in the back and lower abdomen. For some women the pain is unbearable and has to be treated with medication and painkillers.
Many women suffer depression and stress during their period, especially at the beginning, and their mental and intellectual state is at the lowest level during menstruation.
Some women suffer migraines just before their period starts, and the pain is severe and causes visual disturbances and vomiting.
Women’s sexual desire decreases, and many woman have no interest at all in sex during their periods. The entire reproductive system is in a state that is akin to sickness, so intercourse at this time is not natural and serves no purpose, rather it can cause a great deal of harm.
A woman’s temperature drops during menstruation, as does her pulse and blood pressure, which makes her feel dizzy, exhausted and lethargic.” 

Dr. al-Bar also mentions that the harm is not only caused to the woman by having intercourse with her, rather the man is also affected by this action, which may cause infection in his reproductive system which may lead to sterility as a result. The severe pains suffered as a result of this infection may be even worse than the sterility it causes.  
And there are many other harmful effects, some of which have not yet been discovered, but Allah has referred to them when He said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say: that is an Adha (a harmful thing for a husband to have sexual intercourse with his wife while she is having her menses), therefore, keep away from women during menses and go not unto them till they are purified (from menses and have taken a bath).” [al-Baqarah 2:222]
Allah has described it as adha, a harmful thing both for the wife and for the husband, and other harmful effects about which Allah knows best. 
Thus it becomes clear that the prohibition on intercourse at the time of menstruation is not just because of the blood, rather it is for many reasons as stated above. 
The Muslim must also obey the command of Allah, for He is the Creator and He knows best what is good for His slaves and what is harmful to them. He is the One Who says “keep away from women during menses”, so even if the reason behind this is not clear, we must still submit to the command of Allah Who has commanded that a man should not have intercourse with his wife during this time.

43033,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/43033,Should zakah on jewellery be based on the price for new gold or used gold?,"In zakat, if I have gold do I go to the jeweller and get my gold valued or do I take the market value of gold? The jeweller will give me a lower value for my personal gold because it is second hand whereas the market value will be higher.",,,"Praise be to Allah.If the gold reaches the minimum threshold at which zakah becomes due (the nisab), which is 85 grams, and one full hijri year has passed since it was acquired, then zakah must be paid on it, by giving one quarter of one tenth of it, or of its value. What is meant by its value is the price for which it would be sold used at the time when zakah is due. This is usually less than the price for new gold. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Based on this, a woman should work out the value of the gold that she has, whether that is the price for which she bought it or less, or more, so she should work out its value as used gold then pay one quarter of one tenth, i.e., one in forty, or two and a half riyals out of every hundred, or twenty five out of every thousand, and so on. The way to do that is to divide the value by forty, and the result is what is to be paid in zakah. In this manner she will discharge her duty and be ransomed from the punishment of the Fire, and nothing will harm her. 
He was asked: Is the zakah of jewellery based on the purchase price or the price each year at the time when zakah is paid? 
He replied:  zakah on jewellery must be paid each year and cannot be based on the purchase price, rather it must be based on the price when the full year has passed. If a woman buys gold for ten thousand riyals, and when the year has passed it is only worth five thousand riyals, then she should only pay zakah on five thousand riyals.

43041,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/43041,Employing non-Muslim workers and allowing them to eat in front of Muslims at the time of fasting,There is a company owner who has non-Muslim workers. Is it permissible for him to stop them from eating and drinking in front of Muslims working in the same company during the day in Ramadaan?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
A person should not employ non-Muslims when 
    he is able to employ Muslims, because the Muslims are better than non-Muslims. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“… and verily, a believing slave is better than a (free) Mushrik (idolater), even though he 
    pleases you. Those (Al-Mushrikoon) invite you to the Fire, but Allaah invites (you) to Paradise and forgiveness by His Leave, and makes His Ayaat 
    (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) clear to mankind that they may remember”
[al-Baqarah 2:221]
But if it is necessary to employ non-Muslim 
    workers, then there is nothing wrong with doing that, but only as far as it is necessary. 
Secondly: 
With regard to their eating and drinking 
    during the day in Ramadaan in front of Muslims who are fasting, there is nothing wrong with that, because the Muslim who is fasting will praise 
    Allaah for having guided him to Islam, which leads to happiness in this world and the hereafter, and he will praise Allaah for protecting him. For 
    even though he is deprived of food and drink in this world according to sharee’ah during the day in Ramadaan, he will have the reward of that on 
    the Day of Resurrection, when it will be said to him (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Eat and drink at ease for that which you 
    have sent on before you in days past!”
[al-Haaqqah 69:24]
But non-Muslims should be stopped from eating and drinking openly in public areas because that 
    goes against the Islamic identity of the country.","End quote, from the words of Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen in Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 8/79"

All the Prohets before the Last Prophet(), were their religion called Islam?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Discussion of the 
    grandfather of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) comes under the heading of rulings on the people of the fatrah 
    which, as Ibn Katheer said, refers to the interval between two Prophets, 
    such as that between ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) and Muhammad  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him), when there was a break in the Message.

    (Tafseer al-Qur’aan il-‘Azeem, 2/35. See also Jam’ 
    al-Jawaami’ by al-Subki, 1/63; Rooh al-Ma’aani by al-Aaloosi, 
    6/103. 

    The scholars divided these people into two categories: 

    1 – Those whom the call reached and

    2 – Those whom the call did not reach, so they remained 
    unaware. 

    The first category may be further divided into two groups:  

    (i)Those whom the call reached and 
    who believed in Allaah alone and did not associate anything with Him, such 
    as Qiss ibn Saa’idah and Zayd ibn ‘Amr ibn Nufayl. See al-Bidaayah 
    a’l-Nihaayah, 2/230; Fath al-Baari, 7/147.

    (ii)Those whom the call reached but 
    they changed it and associated others with Allaah, such as ‘Amr ibn Luhayy 
    who changed the religion of Ibraaheem and of whom the Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “I saw ‘Amr ibn ‘Aamir ibn Luhayy 
    al-Khuzaa’i dragging his intestines in Hell.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3521; 
    Muslim, 2856.

    It was narrated from the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) that his parents are in Hell. Muslim (203) narrated that 
    a man said: “O Messenger of Allaah, where is my father?’ He said: “In Hell.” 
    When the man turned away, he called him back and said: “My father and your 
    father are in Hell.” 

    With regard to his mother he  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “I asked my Lord for permission to pray for 
    forgiveness for my mother, and He did not give me permission. I asked him 
    for permission to visit her grave, and He gave me permission.” Narrated by 
    Muslim, 976. 

    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, commenting on 
    the first hadeeth: 

    This indicates that whoever died during the fatrah (interval 
    between two Prophets) following the way of the Arabs at that time, namely 
    idol-worship, is among the people of Hell. We cannot say that the message 
    did not reach these people, because the message of Ibraaheem and other 
    Prophets had reached these people. 

    Sharh Saheeh Muslim, 3/79. 
However some scholars 
    have tried to defend the parents of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) and say that they will be saved from Hell, and that 
    Allaah brought them back to life after they had died, and they became Muslim 
    and believed in the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him), then they died like that (as Muslims). They quoted as evidence for 
    this mawdoo’ (fabricated) and da’eef jiddan (very weak) ahaadeeth which 
    cannot be regarded as evidence. 

    See al-Haawi li’l-Fataawi, 2/202 

    The scholars refuted this idea. 
Al-‘Azeemabaadi said: 

    Everything that has been narrated concerning the parents of 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) being brought 
    back to life and believing and being saved is mostly fabrications and lies, 
    and some of it is da’eef jiddan (very weak) and is not saheeh at all, 
    according to the consensus of the leading hadeeth scholars who judged it to 
    be mawdoo’ (fabricated) and da’eef (weak), such as al-Daaraqutni, 
    al-Jawzaqaani, Ibn Shaheen, al-Khateeb, Ibn ‘Asaakir, Ibn Naasir, Ibn 
    al-Jawzi, al-Suhayli, al-Qurtubi and others. ‘Awn al-Ma’bood, 12/494. 
    See also Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 4/324 
We should understand 
    that blood ties will not save anyone from the wrath of Allaah. Al-Nawawi 
    (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    Whoever dies in kufr will be in Hell and his blood ties will 
    not benefit him at all. Sharh Saheeh Muslim, 3/79. 
The ruling on the 
    parents and grandfather of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) is no exception to that. The father of Ibraaheem (peace be upon 
    him) was a kaafir and remained so until he died, and Ibraaheem disavowed 
    himself of him, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And Ibraaheem’s (Abraham) invoking (of Allaah) for his 
    father’s forgiveness was only because of a promise he [Ibraaheem (Abraham)] 
    had made to him (his father). But when it became clear to him that he (his 
    father) is an enemy of Allaah, he dissociated himself from him”

    [al-Tawbah 9:114] 

    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    even stated this clearly, when the following verse was revealed 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And warn your tribe (O Muhammad) of near kindred”

    [al-Shu’ara’ 26:214]

    He said: ""O people ofQuraysh (or said similar words)! Buy (i.e. save)yourselves (from the Hellfire) as I cannot save you fromAllaah's punishment. O Bani Abd Manaaf, I cannot saveyou from Allaah's punishment.  O ‘Abbaas ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib, I 
    cannot saveyou from Allaah's punishment.  O

43062,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/43062,He works as the deputy manager in a hotel that sells alcohol – what is the ruling on his work?,"I work in a hotel as a deputy manager and as manager of reception. Is this job regarded as haraam or makrooh, because the hotel sells alcohol, but I have nothing to do with selling it, buying it, carrying it or serving it – on the contrary my job is solely administrative. Thank you.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    It is not permissible to work in a hotel in which sins are 
    committed, such as drinking alcohol, zina and so on, because it is helping 
    in sin and transgression and failing to denounce evil. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And it has already been 
    revealed to you in the Book (this Qur’aan) that when you hear the Verses of 
    Allaah being denied and mocked at, then sit not with them, until they engage 
    in a talk other than that; (but if you stayed with them) certainly in that 
    case you would be like them. Surely, Allaah will collect the hypocrites and 
    disbelievers all together in Hell”
[al-Nisa’ 4:140] 

    Al-Qurtubi said: The words of Allaah “then sit not with 
    them, until they engage in a talk other than that” mean something other 
    than kufr. “(but if you stayed with them) certainly in that case you 
    would be like them” this indicates that it is essential to avoid sinners 
    if they are committing evil openly, because the one who does not avoid them 
    is approving of their actions, and approving of kufr is itself kufr. Allaah 
    says “certainly in that case you would be like them”, so everyone who sits 
    in a sinful gathering and does not denounce them shares the burden of sin 
    with them.  

    He should denounce them if they speak sinful words or commit 
    sinful actions; if he is not able to denounce them then he should get up and 
    leave them, so that he will not be among the people mentioned in this 
    verse. 

    It was narrated that ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) caught some people drinking alcohol, and it was said to 
    him that one of the people present was fasting, but he carried out the 
    punishment on him too and recited this verse: “certainly in that case you 
    would be like them”, i.e., approving of a sin is also sin. Hence the one 
    who did it and the one who approved of it were both punished for sin, so 
    they are all doomed. 

    The similarity between the two does not apply in all aspects, 
    but they may appear to be partners in the sin, because a person is 
    influenced by his companion. 

    Moreover there is the fear that if a person works in such 
    places his faith will become weak and he will lose any sense of gheerah 
    (protective jealousy, pride). The Shaytaan may entice him to commit sin. 
    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! 
    Follow not the footsteps of Shaytaan (Satan). And whosoever follows the 
    footsteps of Shaytaan (Satan), then, verily, he commands Al‑Fahsha’ [i.e. to 
    commit indecency (illegal sexual intercourse)], and Al‑Munkar [disbelief and 
    polytheism (i.e. to do evil and wicked deeds; and to speak or to do what is 
    forbidden in Islam)]”

    [al-Noor 24:21]

    Remember the words of Allaah (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 
“And whosoever fears 
    Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out 
    (from every difficulty).
3. And He will provide 
    him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in 
    Allaah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allaah will accomplish his 
    purpose. Indeed Allaah has set a measure for all things”
    [al-Talaaq 65:2-3]

     And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said: “Whoever gives up a thing for the sake of Allaah, Allaah will 
    compensate him with something better than that.” Classed as saheeh by 
    al-Albaani. Do not forget that no soul will ever die until it has been given 
    its full provision, sooner or later. 

    We ask Allaah to help you to give up this job willingly and 
    to compensate you with something better than it, and to grant you provision 
    by His bounty, and to grant us and you sufficient means from that which is 
    permissible so that we have no need of that which is forbidden.

    Firstly: 
Drawing animate beings 
    such as people and animals is haraam, and is in fact a major sin. We have 
    already quoted the evidence for that in question no.
    
    7222. 
    We have also stated in question no. 
    9473that if a picture is drawn without the head, then it is no longer 
    haraam. 

    Secondly: 

    If a student is required to draw something and he is able to 
    draw a permissible image, then he should do that. In this case it is not 
    permissible to draw a haraam image. Examples of permissible images include 
    trees, rivers and other inanimate things, or he can draw people without 
    heads. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was 
    asked: 

    Some students have to draw some animals for the purpose of 
    study. What is the ruling on that? He replied: 

    It is not permissible to make images of these animals because 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed the 
    image-makers and said: “The most severely punished of the people on the Day 
    of Resurrection will be the image-makers.” This indicates that making images 
    is a major sin, because this curse only applies to major sins, and the 
    warning of severe punishment only applies to major sins. But it is possible 
    to draw part of the body such as a hand or foot, etc, because these parts 
    cannot live independently, and the apparent meaning of the texts is that 
    what is forbidden is that which could live (independently), because the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said in some 
    ahaadeeth: “He (the image maker) will be told to breathe life into it and he 
    will not be able to do so.” 

    Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 2/272. 

    He also said: 

    If a student is told to draw and has no other option, then he 
    should draw an animal without a head. 

    Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 2/274, 
    272 

    Thirdly: 

    If a student is obliged to draw a complete picture, and not 
    doing so may cause him to fail, then Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: 

    If this is the case then the student may regarded as being 
    forced to do this thing, so the sin will be on the one who told him to do 
    that. But I hope that those in charge will not go to this extent and force 
    the slaves of Allaah to disobey Allaah.

Secondly: 
You are not obliged to pay off her debts – even if she is Muslim – either during her lifetime or after she dies, unless she has left money behind, in which case you must pay off her debts from her money (the estate) because that has to do with people’s rights to the money. If there is enough money to pay off the debts, all well and good, otherwise none of them has the right to ask you to pay off the debt, because the debt was owed by your mother, not by you, and you have nothing to do with it. But if she dies as a Muslim, then it is recommended for you to pay off her debts as a way of honouring her, but it is not obligatory.

43087,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/43087,Was Islam spread by the sword?,Was Islam spread by the sword?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.We have already stated in question no. 34830 that jihad is of two types: taking the initiative in fighting and jihad in self-defence.  
Undoubtedly taking the initiative in fighting has a great effect in spreading Islam and bringing people into the religion of Allaah in crowds. Hence the hearts of the enemies of Islam are  filled with fear of jihad. 
In the English-language Muslim World Magazine it says: There should be some kind of fear in the western world, one of the causes of which is that since the time it first appeared in Makkah, Islam has never decreased in numbers, rather it has always continued to increase and spread. Moreover Islam is not only a religion, rather one of its pillars is jihad. 
Robert Bean says: The Muslims conquered the entire world before and they could do it again. 
The Orientalists wanted to slander Islam by claiming that it was spread by the sword. 
The orientalist Thomas Arnold wrote his book The Preaching of Islam with the aim of killing off the spirit of jihad among the Muslims and proving that Islam was not spread by the sword, rather that it spread by means of peaceful preaching, free from any use of force. 
The Muslims fell into the trap that was set up for them. When they heard the orientalists’ accusations that Islam was spread by the sword, they said: You are mistaken, listen to a refutation from one of your own people, this Thomas says such and such. 
The defeatists among the Muslims come out to defend Islam, and they want to disavow Islam of this so-called lie, so they deny that Islam was spread by the sword, and they say that jihad is not prescribed in Islam, except in the case of self-defence. There is no such thing in Islam as taking the initiative in fighting in their view. This goes against what the Muslim scholars have stated, let alone the fact that it goes against the Qur’aan and Sunnah. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 28/263. 
The purpose is that all religion should be for Allaah alone, and that the word of Allaah should be supreme. The word of Allaah is a comprehensive phrase that refers to His words that are contained in His Book. Hence Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Indeed We have sent Our Messengers with clear proofs, and revealed with them the Scripture and the Balance (justice) that mankind may keep up justice”
[al-Hadeed 57:25]
The purpose behind sending the Messengers and revealing the Books was so that mankind might keep up justice with regard to the rights of Allaah and the rights of His creation. Then Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And We brought forth iron wherein is mighty power (in matters of war), as well as many benefits for mankind, that Allaah may test who it is that will help Him (His religion) and His Messengers in the unseen”
[al-Hadeed 57:25]
So whoever deviates from the Book is to be brought back with iron, i.e. by force. Hence the soundness of the religion is based on the Qur’aan and the Sword. It was narrated that Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded us to strike with this, meaning the sword, whoever turns away from this, meaning the Qur’aan. 
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Faroosiyyah (p.18): 
Allaah sent him – meaning the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) – with the guiding Book and the conquering sword, ahead of the Hour, so that Allaah alone would be worshipped with no partner or associate, and his provision was placed beneath the shade of his sword and spear. Allaah has established the religion of Islam with proof and evidence, and with the sword and spear, both together and inseparable. 
This is some of the evidence from the Qur’aan and Sunnah. The evidence clearly indicates that the sword is one of the most important means that led to the spread of Islam. 
1 – Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“For had it not been that Allaah checks one set of people by means of another, monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques, wherein the Name of Allaah is mentioned much would surely, have been pulled down. Verily, Allaah will help those who help His (Cause). Truly, Allaah is All-Strong, All-Mighty”
[al-Hajj 22:40]
“And if Allaah did not check one set of people by means of another, the earth would indeed be full of mischief. But Allaah is full of bounty to the ‘Aalameen (mankind, jinn and all that exists)”
[al-Baqarah 2:251]
2 – Allaah has commanded us to prepare the means of fighting against the kuffaar and frightening them. He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And make ready against them all you can of power, including steeds of war (tanks, planes, missiles, artillery) to threaten the enemy of Allaah and your enemy, and others besides whom, you may not know but whom Allaah does know”
[al-Anfaal 8:60]
If Islam was only spread by peaceful means, what would the kuffaar have to be afraid of? Of mere words spoken on the tongue? In al-Saheehayn it is narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “I have been supported with fear as far as a month’s journey.” Would the kuffaar be afraid of being told, “become Muslim, but if you do not then you are free to believe and do whatever you want”? or were they afraid of jihad and the imposition of the jizyah and being humiliated? That may make them enter Islam so that they may be spared this humiliation. 
3 – When the Messenger called people to Islam, his call was accompanied by the sword, and he commanded his leaders to do likewise, so that when the people saw the serious of the Muslims in calling people to their religion, that dispelled any confusion. 
Al-Bukhaari (3009) and Muslim (2406) narrated that Sahl ibn Sa’d (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said on the day of Khaybar: “Tomorrow I will give the banner to a man at whose hands victory will come, one who loves Allaah and His Messenger, and Allaah and His Messenger love him.” The people spent that night wondering which of them would be given the banner and all of them were hoping for it. Then he (the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)) said, “Where is ‘Ali?” It was said, “His eye is hurting.” So he spat in his eyes and made du’aa’ for him, and he was healed, as if there had not been anything wrong with him. Then he gave him the flag and he [‘Ali] said: “Shall I fight them so that they will be like us?” He said: “Go ahead, until you reach their encampment, then call them to Islam and tell them what they are obliged to do, for by Allaah if Allaah were to guide a man at your hands that would be better for you than having red camels [the best kind].” 
So this call to Islam was accompanied by the force of arms. 
Muslim (3261) narrated that Buraydah said: When the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) appointed a commander to lead an army or a raiding party, he would advise him to fear Allaah with regard to himself and the Muslims with him, then he said: “Fight in the name of Allaah and for the sake of Allaah. Fight those who disbelieve in Allaah, fight but do not steal from the war booty (before it is shared out), betray, or mutilate. Do not kill children. If you meet your enemy of the mushrikeen, call them to three things, and whichever one of them they respond to, accept that from them and leave them alone.  Then call them to Islam and if they respond, accept that from them and leave them alone. If they refuse but they pay the jizyah, then they have responded to you, so accept that from them and leave them alone. If they refuse then seek the help of Allaah and fight them…” 
So the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told his commanders to call the kuffaar to Islam whilst wielding their swords over their heads. If they refused to become Muslim then they should pay the jizyah with humility. If they refused then there was nothing left for them but the sword – “If they refuse then seek the help of Allaah and fight them” 
4 – The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “I have been sent ahead of the Hour with the sword so that Allaah will be worshipped alone, and my provision has been placed in the shade of my spear, and humiliation has been decreed for those who go against my command, and whoever imitates a people is one of them.”  Narrated by Ahmad, 4869; Saheeh al-Jaami’, 2831. 
The fact that the sword and power were means of spreading Islam is not a sources of shame for Islam, rather it is one of its strengths and virtues, because that makes people adhere to that which will benefit them in this world and in the Hereafter. Many people are foolish and lacking in wisdom and knowledge, and if they are left to their own devices they will remain blinded to the truth, indulging in their whims and desires. So Allaah has prescribed jihad in order to bring them back to the truth and to that which will benefit them. Undoubtedly wisdom dictates that the fool should be prevented from doing that which will harm him, and should be forced to do that which will benefit him. 
Al-Bukhaari (4557) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “ ‘You (true believers in Islamic Monotheism, and real followers of Prophet Muhammad and his Sunnah) are the best of peoples ever raised up for mankind’ [Aal- Imraan 3:110 – interpretation of the meaning].” He said: “You are the best (i.e., the most beneficial) of people for mankind, you bring them in the chains that are around their necks until they enter Islam.” Can people be brought in chains except in the case of jihad?? 
This is something for which Islam deserves to be praised, not condemned. The defeatists should fear Allaah lest they distort this religion and cause it to become weak on the basis of the claim that it is a religion of peace. Yes, it is the religion of peace but in the sense of saving all of mankind from worshipping anything other than Allaah and submitting all of mankind to the rule of Allaah. This is the religion of Allaah, not the ideas of any person or the product of human thought, so that those who promote it should feel ashamed to state its ultimate goal, which is that all religion (worship) should be for Allaah alone. When the ideas that people follow are all produced by human beings and the systems and laws that control their lives are all made up by human beings, then in this case each idea and each system has the right to live safely within its own borders so long as it does not transgress the borders of others, so the various ideas and laws can co-exist and not try to destroy one another. But when there is a divine system and law, and alongside it there are human systems and laws, then the matter is fundamentally different, and the divine law has the right to remove the barriers and free people from enslavement to human beings…
 Fiqh al-Da’wah by Sayyid Qutb, 217-222. 
It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (12/14):  
Islam spread by means of proof and evidence to those who listened to the message and responded to it, and it spread by means of force and the sword to those who were stubborn and arrogant, until they were overwhelmed and became no longer stubborn, and submitted to that reality.
