8214,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/8214,Do the jinn help humans in some ways?,"What is the difference between a shaytaan (devil) and a jinn? Do the shayaateen reproduce from males and females? Do the shayaateen interact with humans and serve them in return for the human’s disobeying his Lord? Are there Muslim jinn who serve the Muslims as they served Sulaymaan (peace be upon him)?  If the shayaateen or jinn are able to serve humans, then why do the Muslim jinn not help the Muslim humans in their wars against the kuffaar, and tell them their secrets and support Islam? Why do the kaafir jinn not help the kaafir humans in some way? Did any examples of such things happen at the time of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)? If there are any books about such matters, please tell me about them so that I can be safe from the evil of the shayaateen. May Allaah keep me and you safe from their evil.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The shayaateen are from among the jinn; they are the rebellious 
          ones and the most evil among them, just as the devils among mankind 
          are the rebellious ones and the most evil among them. There are among 
          the jinn, as is the case among mankind, devils who are the rebellious 
          ones and the most evil, kaafirs and evildoers. There are also Muslims 
          among them who are righteous and good. Allaah says (interpretation of 
          the meaning):
“And so We have appointed for every Prophet enemies — Shayaateen 
          (devils) among mankind and jinn, inspiring one another with adorned 
          speech as a delusion (or by way of deception). If your Lord had so willed, 
          they would not have done it; so leave them alone with their fabrications” 
          
[al-‘An’aam 6:112] 
The Shaytaan is 
          the father of the jinn according to many scholars. He is the one who 
          disobeyed his Lord and was too proud to prostrate to Adam, so Allaah 
          expelled him and banished him. Other scholars say that the Shaytaan 
          was one of a group of angels who were called al-jinn; he was 
          too proud to prostrate, so Allaah expelled him and banished him. He 
          became the leader of every evildoer and wicked one, every kaafir and 
          wrongdoer. Every person has a shaytaan and an angel with him, as the 
          Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
          Allaah be upon him) said:
“There is no one among you but he has with him a constant companion 
          (qareen) from among the jinn and a constant companion from among 
          the angels.” They said, “You too, O Messenger of Allaah?” He said, “Me 
          too, but Allaah has helped me against him (the devil-companion) and 
          he has become Muslim.”
And the Prophet 
           (peace and blessings of Allaah 
          be upon him) said that the Shaytaan inspires man to evil and calls man 
          to evil. There are times when he has control over man's heart and can 
          find out, by Allaah’s decree, what a person intends to do of good or 
          evil. There are also times when the angel has control over a person’s 
          heart. He makes him incline towards good and calls him to good. These 
          are things that Allaah has enabled them to do, i.e., He has enabled 
          the two companions, the jinn-companion and the angel-companion, to do 
          these things. Even the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had a shaytaan with him, 
          his constant companion (qareen) from among the jinn, as stated 
          above, in the hadeeth which says that the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
“There is no one among you but he has with him a constant companion 
          (qareen) from among the jinn and a constant companion from among 
          the angels.” They said, “You too, O Messenger of Allaah?” He said, “Me 
          too, but Allaah has helped me against him (the devil-companion) and 
          he has become Muslim.”
The point is that every man has with him a companion from among the 
          angels and a companion from among the shayateen. The believer suppresses 
          his shaytaan by obeying Allaah and adhering steadfastly to His religion, 
          so he humiliates his shaytaan until he becomes weak and unable to stop 
          the believer doing good or make him fall into evil, except what Allaah 
          wills. The sinner, by his disobedience and evil actions, gives his shaytaan 
          the strength to make him do evil and encourageshim to do evil, and discourage 
          him from doing good.  The believer has to fear Allaah and strive 
          against his shaytaan by obeying Allaah and His Messenger, and seeking 
          refuge with Allaah from the Shaytaan. And he should strive to help his 
          angel by obeying Allaah and His Messenger and heeding the commands of 
          Allaah.
The Muslims help their brothers among the jinn to obey 
          Allaah and His Messenger just as they help their human brothers. Humans 
          may help them in some matters without realizing it. They may help them 
          to obey Allaah and His Messenger by teaching and reminding other humans, 
          for the jinn may attend the lessons of humans in the mosques and elsewhere 
          and benefit from them. Humans may also hear some things from the jinn 
          which benefit them; they may wake them up to pray or draw their attention 
          to things which may benefit them or harm them. All of this happens even 
          though the jinn do not make themselves visible to humans. A jinn may 
          make himself visible to some people when pointing them towards something 
          good or something evil. This may happen, although it is rare. Usually 
          they do not appear to humans, although their voices may be heard on 
          some occasions when they wake a person for prayer or tell him of some 
          things. In conclusion, the believing jinn help the believers even though 
          the believers may not realize it, and they love everything good for 
          them. Similarly, believing humans love everything good for their believing 
          brethren among the jinn, and they ask Allaah to give them everything 
          good. They may attend lessons, and they love to listen to the Qur’aan 
          and knowledge, as stated above. The believers among the jinn attend 
          the lessons of humans, at some times and in some lands, and they benefit 
          from the lessons of humans. All of this happens and is well known. This 
          has been clearly stated by many of the scholars whom the jinn contacted 
          and asked about some issues; they told them that they had attended their 
          lessons. All of this is well-known, and Allaah is the One Whose help 
          we seek.
Allaah has told us that the jinn listened to the Qur’aan 
          from the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
          of Allaah be upon him). At the end of Soorat al-Ahqaaf, He says 
          (interpretation of the meaning):
“And (remember) when We sent towards you (Muhammad) a group (three 
          to ten persons) of the jinn, (quietly) listening to the Qur’aan. When 
          they stood in the presence thereof, they said: ‘Listen in silence!’ 
          And when it was finished, they returned to their people, as warners. 
          
They said: ‘O our people! Verily, we have heard a Book (this Qur’aan) 
          sent down after Moosa (Moses), confirming what came before it, it guides 
          to the truth and to the Straight Path (i.e. Islam)” 
[al-Ahqaaf 46:29-30] 
And Allaah revealed 
          other aayahs in a separate soorah, where He says:
“Say (O Muhammad): “It has been revealed to me that a group (from 
          three to ten in number) of jinn listened (to this Qur’aan). They said: 
          ‘Verily, we have heard a wonderful Recitation (this Qur’aan)!” [al-Jinn 
          72:1]   
Many books have been written on this matter. Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah 
          have mercy on him) mentioned a great deal on this topic in his books. 
          There is also a book by one of the scholars entitled al-Marjaan fi 
          Bayaan Ahkaam al-Jaan, by al-Shibli, which is a useful book. There 
          are other books written on this topic as well. You can look for them 
          and ask for them in any bookstore. You could also read the books of 
          Tafseer and learn from the commentary on Soorat al-Jinn and the 
          other aayahs from Soorat al-Ahqaaf and elsewhere which speak 
          of the jinn. You can learn a lot from what the mufassireen (may Allaah 
          have mercy on them) said about the jinn, both the good and the bad among 
          them.","Kitaab Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah li Samaahat al-Shaykh al-‘Allaamah ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him), vol. 9, p. 373"
8216,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/8216,Washing with blood is clearly an evil action and is haraam,"My mother was sick and she went to a number of hospitals, but to no avail. In the end, she went to a kaahin (soothsayer or fortuneteller) who told her to wash with goat’s blood. In fact my mother did what he asked her to do – not knowing the shar’i ruling. Do we have to offer any kafaarah? May Allaah reward you with good.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to go to soothsayers, astrologers, magicians 
          or any other kind of tricksters. It is not permissible to ask them anything 
          or to believe what they say. This is one of the gravest of major sins.The Prophet  (peace and blessings 
          of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever goes to a fortuneteller and asks 
          him about something, his prayers will not be accepted for forty days.” 
          (Narrated by Imaam Muslim in his Saheeh). 
          And he  (peace and blessings of 
          Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever goes to a soothsayer or fortuneteller 
          and believes what he says has disbelieved in that which was revealed 
          to Muhammad  (peace and blessings 
          of Allaah be upon him).” (Narrated by the authors of Sunan 
          with a saheeh isnaad). And he  (peace 
          and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “He is not one of us who 
          practises magic or has magic done for him, or who tells fortunes or 
          has his fortune told, or who practises augury or has augury done for 
          him. Whoever goes to a soothsayer and believes what he says has disbelieved 
          in that which was revealed to Muhammad  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).” (narrated by al-Bazzaar 
          with a jayyid isnaad).  
With regard to washing with blood, it is clearly an evil 
          action and is haraam, because it is not permissible to seek treatment 
          with things that are naajis (impure). Abu Dawood (may Allaah have mercy 
          on him) narrated in his Sunan 
          from Abu’l-Darda’ (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet 
           (peace and blessings of Allaah 
          be upon him) said: “Allaah has sent down the disease and the cure; He 
          has made for every disease a cure, so seek treatment but do not seek 
          treatment with that which is haraam.” And He  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah does not make 
          your healing in that which He has forbidden to you.” (Narrated by al-Bayhaqi 
          and classed as saheeh by Ibn Hibbaan from the hadeeth of Umm Salamah, 
          may Allaah be pleased with her). So your mother has to repent to Allaah 
          and not do such a thing again. Whoever repents sincerely, Allaah will 
          accept his repentance, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
          
“And all of you beg Allaah to 
          forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful”[al-Noor 24:31] 
          
 Sincere repentance also includes regret for past 
          sins, and giving them up, and resolving not to go back to them, out 
          of veneration and love for Allaah, and the desire to seek His pleasure 
          and avoid His wrath. If the sin has to do with the rights of another, 
          then correct repentance is subject to a fourth condition, which is restoring 
          his rights or seeking his forgiveness. And Allaah is the One Whose help 
          we seek.","Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanaww’iah li Samaahat al-Shaykh al-‘Allaamah ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him), vol. 9, p. 421"
8217,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/8217,About showing preference to one child in gift-giving,"In some cases, one child excels over the others in his honouring and love towards his parents, so his father may single him out for love and gift-giving because of that. Is it fair to reward the one who honours his parents most in return for his doing so?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Undoubtedly some children are better than others; this is well known. But the father has no right to show favouritism because of that. On the contrary, he has to treat them all fairly because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Fear Allah and treat your children equally.” So it is not permissible for him to prefer one child over another because he is better or honours his parents more. He has to treat them all equally and be sincere towards all of them, so that they will all be steadfast in honouring their parents and in obeying Allah and His Messenger. He should not favour some over others in gift-giving, or bequeath wealth to some of them and not others. All of them should be equal in inheritance and in gift-giving, according to what is prescribed in sharee’ah concerning inheritance and gift-giving. They should all be treated fairly as stated in sharee’ah, so the man has the equivalent of the share of two females. So if he gives one of his sons a thousand, a daughter should be given five hundred. If they are wise and tolerant, and they say, Give our brother such-and-such, and they clearly do not mind, and they say, We don’t mind if you give him a car or whatever… and this is clearly done freely and not because they are too shy or are afraid of him, then that is OK. 
The point is that they must be treated fairly. But if they are wise, whether they are male or female, if they have no objection to one of them being given something for special reasons, then that is OK and they have the right to do that.","Majmoo’ Fataawaa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah li Samaahat al-Shaykh al-‘Allaamah ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him), vol. 9, p. 234"

          is not permissible to hand over Muslim orphans to the non-Muslims, Christians or others, because of the great danger that this poses to the orphans, 
          and because they will not be given an Islamic upbringing. They (orphans) 
          are a trust (amaanah) for which the Muslims are responsible, so it is 
          not permissible to place them under the guardianship of anyone else.

Is this haraam or not?",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to shave the beard, because according

          one of them.” If you are doing a job where you are required to shave 
          your beard, do not obey them with regard to that, because the Messenger 
           (peace and blessings of Allaah

          involves disobedience to the Creator.”  If they oblige you to shave

Are there specific days for offering condolences, as they say that it is for only three days (after the death)?

8285,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/8285,Effects of Jinn on Urinary Incontinence,"I read one question about someone having trouble while doing wudhu (ablution). I have a similar problem, or even worse. Whenever I want to pray I feel gas coming out of me, if I go to the toilet for urine I spend more than 30 minutes but urine and other liquid keep on coming from my private part, during salah (formal prayer) I have excessive an desire to go to the toilet, I have to repeat my ablution again and again; this situation is really embarrassing me, it makes salah very difficult for me and this really has an effect on my faith. I am sure this is not a kind of illness because I have seen many doctors but no improvement, and also this problem comes only when I want to pray.

Some people said it could be a jinn which has entered my body.

Please tell me how I can do my salah easily; can I pray more than one salah with the same wudhu even when these things are coming out of me. If this is caused by jinn, how can I get rid of it?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Urinary 
    incontinence and similar conditions where liquid etc, is passed 
    involuntarily and one cannot control it, should not be given any attention, 
    rather the person should pray according to his situation, even if that 
    liquid etc. is emitted during prayer, because it is too difficult to avoid 
    it. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):

     “… and has not 
    laid upon you in religion any hardship.” [22:78]

    But if he fears 
    that his body or clothes may become contaminated, he should wrap it (i.e. 
    the private part) with a cloth or something similar, and pray after doing 
    wudhu, and he should not pay attention to anything that comes out that he 
    cannot control. This is an ordinary kind of sickness, which is very common,

Al-Nasaa’i narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The prayer of the one who goes to them and believes them will not be accepted.” Is this correct? Please explain to us what was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and what the scholars have said.",,,"Praise be to Allah.There are many ahadith which state that this is haram, such as the hadeeth narrated from Safiyah bint Abi ‘Ubayd from one of the wives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who narrated that he said: “Whoever goes to a soothsayer and asks him about something and believes him, his prayer will not be accepted for forty days.” (Narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh).
 Qusaybah ibn al-Mukhaariq said: “I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: ‘Al-‘ayaafah, al-tiyarah and al-turuq [kinds of augury] are all part of al-jabt [witchcraft or idolatry].’” This was narrated by Abu Dawood with a saheeh isnaad. Abu Dawood said: Al-‘ayaafah, al-khatt and al-turuq are all kinds of augury, whereby a bird is released and is watched to see whether it flies to the right or to the left. If it flies to the right it is taken as a good omen and if it flies to the left it is taken as a bad omen. Al-Jawhari said: al-jabt is a word which may be applied to idols, soothsayers, magicians, astrologers etc.
 It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever seeks knowledge from the stars is seeking one of the branches of witchcraft…” Narrated by Abu Dawood with a saheeh isnaad.
 It was narrated that Mu’aawiyah ibn al-Hakam said: “I said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, I am still close to the time of Jaahiliyyah [i.e., I am new in Islam]. Allah has brought Islam to us, but there are among us men who go to soothsayers (fortune tellers).’ He said, ‘Do not go to them.’ I said, ‘And there are men among us who practise augury [watch birds for omens].’ He said, ‘That is something which they make up. Do not believe them.’” (Narrated by Muslim).
 It was narrated from Abu Mas’ood al-Badri that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade the price of a dog, the fee of a prostitute and the payment of a soothsayer. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim).
 It was reported that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “Some people asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about soothsayers. He said, ‘They are nothing.’ They said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, sometimes they say something and it comes true.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘That is a word of truth that the jinn snatches and whispers into the ear of his familiar, but they mix a hundred lies with it.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim).
 It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever comes to a soothsayer and believes what he says, or has intercourse with a woman in her back passage, has nothing to do with that which has been revealed to Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).” (Narrated by Abu Dawood).
 … The scholars have stated that it is haram to deal with such matters or to go to find out about them or to believe in them. It is haram to pay them money, and anyone who is suffering from any of these things must hasten to repent from it.

8294,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/8294,Differences among the fuqahaa’,"What is the meaning of the expression, “This is a controversial matter, this is a matter concerning which the fuqahaa’ differed”? What is the correct attitude towards this?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Undoubtedly there 
          are matters concerning which there are differences among the scholars, 
          matters which are subject to ijtihaad. What the scholars have said, 
          in the past and in modern times, about controversial matters and ijtihaad 
          is well known, but nowadays it is stirred up in a manner that takes 
          it beyond the framework of research into controversial matters which 
          are the subject of ijtihaad.
·In most cases, controversy 
          is stirred up in matters which are regarded as social or academic issues. 
          The purpose is not mere differences of fiqhi opinion. Many westernizers, 
          for example, stir up issues that have to do with women, concerning which 
          scholarly differences have been reported. The motive for doing this 
          is far removed from mere differences of fiqhi opinion. It is an excuse 
          for westernization that will soon go beyond the disputed issue to affect 
          matters which are indisputably haraam. 
·These issues are stirred 
          up by people who are not scholars or fuqahaa’, who do not have a proper 
          understanding of research into matters of sharee’ah. They only adopt 
          the views of fuqahaa’ which happen to suit their own whims and desires. 
          
·In most cases they take 
          things out of context, and the fiqhi dispute is taken as an excuse and 
          is applied to a wider range. 
The 
          following has to be said about this matter: 
 -that there is a difference 
          between matters of controversy and matters which are subject to ijtihaad. 
          Not every issue concerning which there are reports of differences among 
          the scholars can be counted as a matter in which no views may be denounced 
          [i.e., all are acceptable]. That applies only to matters of ijtihaad. 
          Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “Their view that 
          in matters of dispute no views may be denounced is not correct. The 
          denunciation is directed either at the opinion and fatwa, or at the 
          action. In the first case, if the opinion goes against Sunnah or a well-known 
          ijmaa’ (consensus), it must be denounced unanimously. This confusion 
          arises when the one who says it believes that controversial matters 
          are matters which are subject to ijtihaad, as is believed by groups 
          of people who do not have deep knowledge. The correct view is that of 
          the imaams, which is that there is room for ijtihaad in cases where 
          there is no clear evidence which we should follow, such as a saheeh 
          hadeeth which does not conflict with other evidence of the same calibre 
          . There are many ssues concerning which the earlier and later generations 
          differed, but in many cases we have reached a point of certainty as 
          to which of the two views is correct.” (I’laam 
          al-Muwaqqi’een, vol. 3/288). 
-The reference point in 
          all cases must be the texts of the Qur’aan and Sunnah. When there is 
          saheeh evidence it must be referred to and followed; it is not right 
          to follow the opposite view with the excuse that there are differences 
          of opinion on the matter. If the saheeh Sunnah which has been reported 
          via a sound chain from the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is rejected because there 
          is someone who says something different concerning this matter, this 
          implies that a person thinks that the words and commands of the Prophet 
           (peace and blessings of Allaah 
          be upon him) do not carry any weight unless people unanimously agree 
          with it, and the fact that someone disagrees with it, no matter who 
          he is, is taken as a reason to take away this authority [of the Sunnah] 
          and leave the matter wide open (to dispute). This is a dangerous path, 
          and the one who follows it needs to review his faith. 
-It is essential to pay 
          attention to teaching people to submit to Allaah and to respect the 
          texts of sharee’ah, and to take their religion seriously, and to avoid 
          easy options and the mistakes made by the scholars. 
-Beware of entering into 
          debates of fiqh with such people on such topics. This is what they want. 
          It is possible and is acceptable for a man to look into a matter and 
          discuss it with knowledgeable people who understand the specialized 
          terminology of fiqh, and who sincerely desire the truth and are striving 
          for it. But those who stir up these issues do not have a good understanding 
          of the terminology of fiqh or of the objectives of sharee’ah; they are 
          simply interfering with something which they are not qualified to handle, 
          and their desires have led them to indulge in discussing matters of 
          religion.","By Muhammad ibn ‘Abd-Allaah al-Duwaysh ,Al-Bayaan magazine, issue #153, p. 28"
