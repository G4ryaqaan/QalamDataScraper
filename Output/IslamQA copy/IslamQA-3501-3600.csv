3578,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3578,"Woman
    exciting herself to the point of climax","I wanted to know if a woman can excite
      herself till she comes. Does this make her unclean the way intercourse does?",,,"Praise be to Allah.If a woman excites herself to the point of climax, it is
    obligatory (waajib) for her to do ghusl, and she is considered to be junub (in a state of
    sexual impurity) because of that. The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)
    said: “Water is for water” (Saheeh Muslim, 151), i.e., ghusl becomes waajib when
    fluid is emitted as a result of sexual stimulation.
But this action – when a person excites herself or himself to the
    point of climax – is masturbation, which is forbidden for men and women alike. There
    is no differentiation between them in this regard. For more information and explanation of
    the evidence (daleel), please see Question #329.

3593,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3593,Zakat on vegetables and fruits,"If one has a garden in which vegetables and fruits are grown for his own purpose, is he required to pay 'ushr on its harvest?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Zakat is not required on vegetables or fruits, because they are not measured or stored. Zakat is, however, required on fruits that are measured and stored, such as dates, raisins, almonds, pistachios, But if they are not measured and are not stored – such as pomegranates, figs, peaches, melons and other fruits, and tomatoes, cucumbers and other vegetables – there is no Zakat due for them, because if they are stored they will be spoiled.
 It was reported from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no Zakat due on grains or dates unless they reach the amount of five awsuq.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, Muslim and others. This is if they are measurable, so it is more appropriate that no Zakat should be paid on things that are not measured at all.
 It was reported from ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib in a marfoo’ report – and some said it was mawqoof – “There is no Zakat due on vegetables.”
 Moreover, neither the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) nor his successors (al-Khulafaa’ al-Raashidoon) collected Zakah for fruits and vegetables. Although they were grown in their regions, there was no Zakah paid on them. This indicates that there is no Zakah to be paid for these things.
 And your garden is for your own personal use, not for business purposes, so it is definite that there is no Zakat required for the produce of this garden. But if it is for business purposes, and you keep the profit from it for one complete year, in this case you would have to pay Zakah on the money which you have had for one complete year. And Allah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
