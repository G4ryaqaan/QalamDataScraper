    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was asked in Majmoo’ al-Fataawa 
    (15/213): can a Muslim – especially women – pray following a prayer that is 
    being transmitted via TV or radio without seeing the imam? 

    He replied: 

    It is not permissible for anyone to follow the imam via radio 
    or TV, because prayer in congregation means being together in the same 
    place, so it has to be in one place and the rows should be connected to one 
    another (i.e. immediately behind one another). It is not permissible to pray 
    via radio or TV because they do not meet these criteria. If we were to allow 
    that, anyone could pray all five prayers in his house, and Jumu’ah too. This 
    goes against the wisdom behind the prescription of Jumu’ah prayer and prayer 
    in congregation. Based on this, it is not permissible for women or anyone 
    else to pray following the radio or TV. And Allaah is the Source of 
    strength. 

    The Standing Committee (9/218) was asked: 

    Is it permissible for women to pray Jumu’ah prayer in their 
    houses, and all the other prayers, following the loudspeakers in the 
    village? Is it permissible for a sick person who cannot pray in the mosque 
    to follow the imam from his house through the loudspeaker? 

    They replied: 

    It is not permissible for men or women, weak or strong, to 
    pray in their houses, individually or in groups, following the prayer of the 
    imam in the mosque via the loudspeakers, whether that is an obligatory 
    prayer or supererogatory (naafil), Jumu’ah or any other prayer, whether 
    their houses are behind the imam or in front of him, because the obligatory 
    prayers must be offered in congregation in the mosque by men who are strong 
    and in good health, but women and men who are weak and in poor health are 
    excused from that duty. 

    The Standing Committee was also asked about a woman praying 
    in her house, following the radio or TV, if she can hear the recitation and 
    takbeer, if that is an obligatory or naafil prayer. 

    They replied: She is not permitted to do that, regardless of 
    whether it is an obligatory prayer or a naafil one, even if she can hear the 
    recitation and takbeer of the imam.

    He does not have to offer expiation and there is no sin on 
    him, because the traveler is permitted not to fast, but he has to make up 
    that day. 

    The Standing Committee (10/202) was asked about the ruling on 
    a man who has intercourse with his wife during the day in Ramadaan when they 
    are traveling and not fasting. They replied: 

    It is permitted for a traveler who is traveling during the 
    day in Ramadaan to break the fast, because Allaah says (interpretation of 
    the meaning): 
“and whoever is ill or on 
    a journey, the same number [of days which one did not observe Sawm (fasts) 
    must be made up] from other days”

    [al-Baqarah 2:185]

    It is permissible for him to eat, drink and have intercourse 
    so long as he is traveling. 

    Shaykh Ibn Baaz was asked in Majmoo’ al-Fataawa 
    (15/307) about the ruling on a man who has intercourse during the day in 
    Ramadaan when he is fasting; is it permissible for a traveler to have 
    intercourse with his wife if he is not fasting? 

    They replied: 

    The one who has intercourse during the day in Ramadaan when 
    he is observing an obligatory fast has to offer expiation, i.e., the 
    expiation of zihaar (which is to free a slave; if that is not 
    possible then to fast for two consecutive months; if that is not possible 
    then to feed sixty poor persons). He must also make up that day, and repent 
    to Allaah for what he has done. But if he is traveling or sick, it is 
    permissible for him not to fast, and he does not have to offer any 
    expiation, and there is no sin on him, but he has to make up the day on 
    which he had intercourse, because those who are sick or traveling are 
    permitted not to fast and to have intercourse etc, as Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and whoever is ill or on 
    a journey, the same number [of days which one did not observe Sawm (fasts) 
    must be made up] from other days”

    [al-Baqarah 2:185]
The ruling on a woman in 
    this case is the same as that on a man, if it was an obligatory fast then 
    she has to offer expiation and make up that day; if she was traveling or was 
    sick and fasting would be too difficult, then she does not have to offer 
    expiation. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was asked in Fataawa al-Siyaam 
    (344) about a man who had intercourse with his wife during the day in 
    Ramadan when he was traveling. 
He replied: There 
    is no sin on him for that, because the traveler is permitted to break his 
    fast and to eat, drink and have intercourse, so there is no sin on him and 
    he does not have to offer expiation. But he has to fast another day to make 
    up the day that he did not fast in Ramadaan. Similarly there is no sin on 
    the woman if she was travelling and not fasting on that day. But if she was 
    not traveling then it is not permissible for him to have intercourse with 
    her if she is observing an obligatory fast, because he will invalidate her 
    acts of worship, so she has to refuse.",Islam Q&A
50273,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50273,She does not have any wealth apart from jewellery – should she sell some of it in order to pay the zakaah on it?,I have gold that I need to pay Zakat for. But I do not have money to pay the Zakat. What should I do? should I sell part of the gold to pay Zakat.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
      Whoever owns the minimum amount of gold (nisaab), namely 85 
      grams, and one full hijri year has passed, is obliged to pay zakaah on it, 
      by giving one-quarter of one-tenth (2.5%), whether that is paid from the 
      gold itself or the equivalent after selling it, or from other wealth. 

    As you do not own any other wealth with which to pay the 
    zakaah, you have to give the zakaah from the gold itself, or sell some of it 
    and pay the zakaah. If someone (your father, brother, husband, etc) 
    volunteers to pay zakaah on your behalf, that is permissible, and he will be 
    rewarded for it. 

    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
If zakaah is owed by a 
    woman who owns jewellery, and her husband or someone else pays it on her 
    behalf with her permission, there is nothing wrong with that. Zakaah does 
    not have to be paid from the jewellery itself, rather it is sufficient to 
    give its value every time one hijri year passes, according to the value of 
    gold and silver in the market at the time when the year is completed. 

    From Fataawa Islamiyyah, 2/85 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was 
    asked: Is zakaah due on gold that is prepared for adornment, if a woman does 
    not have any means of paying zakaah other than selling some of the gold? 

    He replied: 

    The correct scholarly view and the most likely to be correct 
    in my view is that zakaah must be paid on jewellery if it reaches the nisaab 
    (minimum threshold), which is eighty-five grams. If it reaches this amount, 
    zakaah must be paid on it. If she has other wealth and pays from that, there 
    is nothing wrong with it. If her husband or one of her relatives pays it on 
    her behalf, there is nothing wrong with that. If neither of these options is 
    available to her, then she should sell some of it and pay zakaah with that 
    money. 

    Some people may say: if we do this, soon she will not have 
    any jewellery left.  

    We say: that is not correct, because if it falls below the 
    nisaab, even by a small amount, no zakaah is required. In that case she will 
    inevitably have some jewellery left.

50282,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50282,Should You Continue Fasting If You Get Your Period Just Before Sunset?,"If my period comes while I am fasting, should I complete the day fasting or not?","It is haram for a Muslim woman to continue fasting when she is menstruating. If she gets her period while fasting, her fast is spoiled, even if the blood comes a moment before sunset, and she has to make that up if it was an obligatory fast.",What Happens If You Get Your Period Before Iftar?,"Praise be to Allah.What Happens If You Get Your Period Before Iftar?
If a woman gets her period while fasting, her fast is spoiled, even if the blood comes a moment before sunset , and she has to make that up if it was an obligatory fast. It is haram for her to continue fasting when she is menstruating. 
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Majmu’ (2/386): 
“The ummah is unanimously agreed that it is haram for women who are menstruating or bleeding following childbirth to fast and that their fast is not valid… The ummah is also unanimously agreed that it is obligatory for these women to make up missed Ramadan fasts . Al-Tirmidhi, Ibn al-Mundhir, Ibn Jarir, our companions and others narrated that there was consensus on this point.” 
Ibn Qudamah said in al-Mughni (4/397): 
“The scholars are unanimously agreed that it is not permissible for women who are menstruating or bleeding following childbirth to fast, and that they should not fast in Ramadan but should make up missed fasts. If they do fast, their fast is not accepted. ‘Aishah said: “We used to menstruate at the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and we were commanded to make up the fasts, but we were not commanded to make up the prayers.” Agreed upon.  The one who commanded them thus was the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Abu Sa’id said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Is it not the case that when one of you menstruates, she does not pray or fast? That is what is meant by lacking in religious commitment.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari)
Menstruating women and women who are bleeding following childbirth are regarded as the same, because the blood of nifas is like the blood of menstruation, so it comes under the same rulings. If menstruation starts during the day, the fast of that day is invalidated, whether it starts at the beginning of the day or at the end. If a menstruating woman intends to fast and refrains from eating or drinking, even though she knows that that is haram, she is committing a sin, and that fast does not count.” 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said in his essay al-Dima al-Tabi’iyyah li’l-Nisa (p.28): 
“If a woman menstruates when she is fasting, her fast is invalidated even if that is a moment just before sunset, and she has to make up that day if it was an obligatory fast. 
If she feels that her period is about to begin but nothing comes out until after sunset, then her fast is complete and is not invalidated, according to the correct view.” 
The Standing Committee (10/155) was asked about a woman who fasted and shortly before sunset and before the adhan, her period came. Is her fast valid? 
They replied:
“If her period came before sunset, her fast is invalid and she has to make it up. If it came after sunset, then her fast is valid and she does not have to make it up.”

50292,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50292,Her periods stopped but a little bit of blood that was pale in colour came out,"I took a contraceptive injection and my periods stopped, but every few days a bit of blood that is pale in colour comes out. Is the fast of that day invalidated? Do I have to do ghusl, or is wudoo’ sufficient?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.With regard to the ruling on contraceptive injections, we have already answered this question. Please see question no. 21169. 
With regard to the ruling on the drops of pale-coloured blood every few days, it seems that this is not menstruation, so it does not mean that you cannot pray and fast, and it does not require ghusl. Rather it is sufficient to do wudoo’. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was asked the following question: 
If a few drops of blood come out of a woman during the day in Ramadaan, and that bleeding continues throughout Ramadaan and she is fasting, is her fast valid? 
He replied: 
Yes, her fast is valid. These few drops do not mean anything, as they come from a vein (and they are not menstrual blood). It was narrated that ‘Ali ibn Taalib (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “These drops that are like a nosebleed are not menstruation.” This is what was narrated from him (may Allaah be pleased with him).
