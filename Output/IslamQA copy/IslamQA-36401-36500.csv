36402,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/36402,Preparing to enter ihraam approximately three hours before reaching the meeqaat,We live approximately 300 km from Makkah and this distance does not take more than three hours by car. Is it permissible for us to do ghusl and put on the ihraam clothes in our houses and then travel to Makkah?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Yes, that is permissible, but you should not enter ihraam until you pass the meeqaat. 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz was asked about someone who lives 350 km from Makkah and comes to Makkah by car – is it permissible for him to prepare for ihraam and do ghusl and put on the ihraam garments in his city? Is it permissible for him to enter ihraam from his city?
 He replied: 
There is nothing wrong with doing ghusl and putting on the ihraam garments and perfume in their homes because they are close to the meeqaat by car. But it is prescribed for them to enter ihraam only from the meeqaat. Ihraam means the intention to start the rituals (of Hajj or ‘Umrah). Along with forming the intention it is prescribed to utter these words such as saying “Labbayk ‘umratan (Here I am for ‘Umrah)” or “Labbayk Hajjan (Here I am for Hajj,” then he should recite the Talbiyah as prescribed in sharee’ah, which is: “Labbayka Allaahumma labbayk, labbayka laa shareeka laka labbayk. Inna al-hamd wa’l-ni’mata laka wa’l-mulk, laa shareeka lak  (Here I am, O Allaah, here I am. Here I am, You have no partner, here I am. Verily all praise and blessings are Yours, and all sovereignty, You have no partner).”
 May Allaah help us all to do that which pleases Him.

36408,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/36408,What conditions should be met in order for the bank’s purchase scheme (muraabahah) to be considered permissible,"My question is: how sound is the following transaction, what is the ruling on it, what is the ruling on someone who has already gotten involved in it and what should he do?
The details of this muraabahah purchase program (as it is called by the bank) are as follows:
1 – The buyer goes and gets a price list for the bank from the main supplier of the product (a car showroom or agency, for example), including a description of the car, its colour, features and price (100,000 riyals, for example).
2 – The buyer obtains a letter stating his salary, and fills out the required forms to have part of his salary deposited in the bank for the period agreed upon with the bank (for example, three years), to pay off the total cost which includes the basic price plus the bank’s profit (for example, 7%).
3 – The contract is drawn up, including the processing fees (1000 riyals for example) and is signed by the bank, the buyer and the witnesses.
4 – The bank issues a draft cheque payable to the showroom or agency (the supplier) for the value of the car as quoted in the price list referred to in #1 above.
5 – The buyer takes the cheque and gives it to the supplier, who then does all the paperwork needed to register the car in the name of the buyer and gives it to him.",,,"Praise be to Allah.This transaction is haram and is not permitted. Basically this transaction is a loan with interest, which is the essence of riba (usury), because the bank gives the buyer a cheque for 100,000 and takes payment for it in installments, adding interest and what they call processing fees. 
Calling this a purchase does not make it permissible, because this deal is essentially a riba-based loan and not a sale or purchase. Also, the bank is not buying the car from the showroom or selling it to the buyer, rather it is giving him a cheque for that amount. 
Buying products (whether cars or anything else) through the bank is not permissible unless two conditions are met: 
1 – The seller should take possession of this product before selling it. So the bank should buy the car, for example, from the showroom for itself. 
2 – The bank should take the car into its own possession by moving it (physically) from the showroom before selling it to the customer. 
If both or either of two conditions are not met, then the transaction is haram, and the reason for that is that when the bank did not buy the car for itself in a real sense, rather it only issued a cheque on behalf of its customer, that was a riba-based loan, because essentially the bank loaned the price of the car (say, 100,000 riyals) to the customer on the basis that it would take back 170,000 riyals. 
If the bank buys the car then sells it before taking possession of it, that goes against the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to Hakeem ibn Hizaam: “When you buy something, do not sell it until you have taken possession of it.” Narrated by Ahmed, 15399; al-Nasaa’i, 4613; classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, no. 342. 
Al-Daaraqutni and Abu Dawood (3499) narrated from Zayd ibn Thaabit that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade selling goods when they have been bought, until the merchants had added them to their own goods. This hadith was classed as hasan by al-Albani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
In al-Saheehayn it is narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever buys food, let him not sell it until he has acquired it.” Al-Bukhaari, 2132; Muslim, 1525. Muslim added: Ibn ‘Abbas said: I think that this applies to everything else – i.e., there is no difference between food and other things in this regard. Based on this, the bank does not have the right to sell the car until it has taken possession of it. Goods are taken possession of according to custom, and taking possession of a car means that it is moved physically from where it was. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Whatever is moveable, such as garments, animals and cars etc, possession is taken of it by moving it, because this is the custom. From Sharh al-Mumti’, 8/381. 
It says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (13/153): If a person asks someone to buy a specific car for him or a car that has certain features that he describes, and promises to buy it from him, and he buys it and takes possession of it, it is permissible for the one who asked for it to buy it from him after that, with cash or in installments for a known profit. This does not come under the heading of a man selling something that he does not own, because the one who was asked for the product only sold it to the one who asked for it after he had bought it and taken possession of it. He does not have the right to sell it to his friend, for example, before buying it, or after buying it but before taking possession of it, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade selling a product where it was bought, until the merchants had added them to their own goods. End quote. 
With regard to the one who engaged in such a transaction in the past, if he did not know at the time that it is haram, and he did that thinking that it was permissible, then he does not have to do anything, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So whosoever receives an admonition from his Lord and stops eating Ribaa, shall not be punished for the past” [Al-Baqarah 2:275]
See also Question no. 2492. 
But whoever did that knowing that it is haram has committed the major sin of riba and exposed himself to a declaration of war from Allah and His Messenger. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“O you who believe! Be afraid of Allah and give up what remains (due to you) from Ribaa (from now onward) if you are (really) believers.
And if you do not do it, then take a notice of war from Allah and His Messenger but if you repent, you shall have your capital sums. Deal not unjustly (by asking more than your capital sums), and you shall not be dealt with unjustly (by receiving less than your capital sums)”
[Al-Baqarah 2:278-279]
So he has to repent from this major sin, and resolve not to do that again. 
With regard to making use of the car that was bought in this manner, there is nothing wrong with doing so, in sha Allah, after repenting and regretting. See question no. 22905.

Is Udhiyah obligatory or Sunnah?","Praise be to Allah.Definition of Udhiyah
The word udhiyah  means an animal of the an’aam class (i.e., camel, cow, sheep or goat) that is slaughtered during the days of Eid al-Adha because of the ‘Eid and as an act of worship, intending to draw closer to Allah thereby. 
This is one of the rituals of Islam prescribed in the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and according to the consensus of the Muslims. 
Reference to Udhiyah in the Quran and the Sunnah
In the Quran, Alaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Therefore turn in prayer to your Lord and sacrifice (to Him only).” [Al-Kawthar 108:2]
 “Say (O Muhammad): Verily, my Salaah (prayer), my sacrifice, my living, and my dying are for Allah, the Lord of the ‘Alameen (mankind, jinn and all that exists). He has no partner. And of this I have been commanded, and I am the first of the Muslims.” [Al-An'am 6:162]
The word nusuk (translated here as sacrifice) means sacrifice; this is the view of Sa’eed ibn Jubayr. And it was said that it means all acts of worship, including sacrifice, which is more comprehensive.  
“And for every nation We have appointed religious ceremonies, that they may mention the Name of Allah over the beast of cattle that He has given them for food. And your Ilah (God) is One Ilah (God, Allah), so you must submit to Him Alone (in Islam). And (O Muhammad) give glad tidings to the Mukhbitoon [those who obey Allah with humility and are humble from among the true believers of Islamic Monotheism].” [Al-Hajj 22:34]
In the Sunnah: 

It was narrated in Saheeh al-Bukhari (5558) and Saheeh Muslim (1966) that Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sacrificed two white rams speckled with black. He slaughtered them with his own hand, said ‘Allahu akbar’ and put his foot on their necks.” 
It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stayed in Madeenah for ten years, offering sacrifice (every year on Eid).” (Narrated by Ahmad, 4935; al-Tirmidhi, 1507; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Mishkaat al-Masaabeeh, 1475.)
It was narrated from ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Aamir (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) shared out sacrificial animals amongst his companions, and ‘Uqbah got a sheep that was six months old. He said, “O Messenger of Allaah, I got a sheep that is six months old.” He said, “Offer it as a sacrifice.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5547)


It was narrated from al-Baraa’ ibn ‘Aazib (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever offers a sacrifice after the prayer has completed his rituals (of Eid) and has followed the way of the Muslims.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5545)

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) offered sacrifices , as did his companions (may Allaah be pleased with them). And he said that sacrifice is the way of the Muslims. 
Hence the Muslims are unanimously agreed that it is prescribed in Islam, as was narrated by more than one of the scholars. 
Is Udhiyah obligatory or Sunnah?
But they differed as to whether it is Sunnah mu’akkadah (a confirmed Sunnah) or it is obligatory and it is not permissible to omit it. 
The majority of scholars are of the view that it udhiyah   is Sunnah mu’akkadah. This is the view of al-Shaafa’i, Maalik and Ahmad according to his most well-known view.
 Others were of the view that it is obligatory. This is the view of Abu Haneefah and one of the views narrated from Ahmad. This was also the view favoured by Ibn Taymiyah who said: “This is one of the views narrated in the madhhab of Maalik, or it appears to be the view of Maalik.” (From Risaalat Ahkaam al-Udhiyah wa’l-Dhakaah by Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him).
 Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “Udhiyah is Sunnah mu’akkadah for the one who is able to do it, so a person should offer the sacrifice on behalf of himself and the members of his household.” (Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 2/661)

The stoning on the days of Tashriq starts from when the sun passes its zenith (i.e., when the time for Zuhr prayer begins) and ends at the end of the night.","Time for soning Jamrat al-`Aqabah


Time for stoning during the days of Tashriq (the 11th, 12th and 13th of Dhul Hijjah)","Praise be to Allah.Time for soning Jamrat al-`Aqabah
Jamrat al-`Aqabah is the first of the jamarat to be stoned. It is stoned on the day of `Eid after the sun has risen. 
It is permissible for the weak – women, children and others – to stone it during the night of ‘Eid (at the end of the night), because Asma bint Abi Bakr (may Allah be pleased with her) used to wait for the moon to set on the night of ‘Eid, then when it set she would leave Muzdalifah for Mina and stone the jamrah. 
The time for stoning Jamrat al-`Aqabah lasts until sunset on the day of `Eid. 
There is nothing wrong with delaying that until the end of the night, because of the severe crowding, or because of being too far away from the jamarat, but it should not be delayed until dawn on the eleventh of Dhul Hijjah. 
Time for stoning during the days of Tashriq (the 11th, 12th and 13th of Dhul Hijjah) 
The stoning on the days of Tashriq starts from when the sun passes its zenith (i.e., when the time for Zuhr prayer begins). 
The time for stoning ends at the end of the night . If it is difficult and too hot etc ., there is nothing wrong with stoning them at night, until dawn comes, but it is not permissible to delay it until after dawn.
 It is not permissible to stone the jamarat on the 11th, 12th or 13th before the sun has passed its zenith, because the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not stone them until after the sun had passed its zenith, and he said to the people: “Learn your rituals (of Hajj) from me.” The fact that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) delayed the stoning until this time, even though it is very hot then, and did not do it at the beginning of the day, when it is cooler and easier, indicates that it is not permissible to stone the jamarat before this time. This is also indicated by the fact that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to stone the jamarat from the time when the sun had passed its zenith, before he prayed Zuhr. This indicates that it is not permissible to stone the jamarat before the sun has passed its zenith – otherwise it would be better to do it before the sun passed its zenith so that one could offer the prayer at the beginning of its time, because it is better to pray at the beginning of the time for prayer. The point is that the evidence indicates that it is not permissible to stone the jamarat on the days of Tashriq before the sun has passed its zenith. (See Fatawa Arkan al-Islam, p. 560)

Time for takbir on ‘Eid al-Adha


Description of the takbir 


Can women adorn themselves when they go out for ‘Eid?","Praise be to Allah.Sunnah acts and etiquettes of ‘Eid
The Sunnahs that the Muslim should observe on the day of ‘Eid are as follows: 
1.     Doing ghusl before going out to the prayer . 
It was narrated in a sahih hadith in al-Muwatta and elsewhere that ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar used to do ghusl on the day of al-Fitr before going out to the prayer-place in the morning. (Al-Muwatta 428) 
Al- Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said that the Muslims were unanimously agreed that it is recommended to do ghusl for ‘Eid prayer . 
The reason why it is recommended is the same reason as that for doing ghusl before Jumu’ah and other public gatherings. Rather on ‘Eid the reason is even stronger. 
2.               Eating before going out to pray on ‘Eid al-Fitr and after the prayer on ‘Eid al-Adha: 
Part of the etiquette is not to go out to pray on ‘Eid al-Fitr until one has eaten some dates, because of the hadith narrated by al-Bukhari from Anas ibn Malik, who said that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used not to go out on the morning of ‘Eid al-Fitr until he had eaten some dates… of which he would eat an odd number. Al-Bukhari, 953. 
It is recommended to eat before going out to emphasize the fact that it is forbidden to fast on that day and to demonstrate that the fast has ended. 
Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) suggested that the reason for that was so as to ward off the possibility of adding to the fast, and to hasten to obey the command of Allah. (Al-Fath, 2/446) 
Whoever does not have any dates may break his fast with anything that is permissible. 
But on ‘Eid al-Adha it is recommended not to eat anything until one comes back from the prayer, so he should eat from the udhiyah if he has offered a sacrifice. If he is not going to offer a sacrifice there is nothing wrong with eating before the prayer. 
3.               Takbir on the day of ‘Eid 
This is one of the greatest Sunnahs on the day of ‘Eid because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“(He wants that you) must complete the same number (of days), and that you must magnify Allah [i.e. to say Takbir (Allahu Akbar: Allah is the Most Great)] for having guided you so that you may be grateful to Him.” [al-Baqarah 2:185] 
Al-Walid ibn Muslim said: “I asked al-Awza’i and Malik ibn Anas about saying Takbir out loud on the two ‘Eids. They said, Yes, ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar used to say it out loud on the day of al-Fitr until the imam came out (to lead the prayers).” 
‘Abd al-Rahman al-Sulami said, “They emphasized it more on the day of al-Fitr than the day of al-Adha.”. Waki’ said, this refers to the takbir. (See Irwa al-Ghalil, 3/122) 
Al-Daraqutni and others narrated that on the morning of ‘Eid al-Fitr and ‘Eid al-Adha, Ibn ‘Umar would strive hard in reciting takbir until he came to the prayer place, then he would recite takbir until the imam came out. 
Ibn Abi Shaybah narrated with a sahih isnad that al-Zuhri said: “The people used to recite Takbir on ‘Eid when they came out of their houses until they came to the prayer place, and until the imam came out. When the imam came out they fell silent, and when he said takbir they said takbir.” (See Irwa al-Ghalil, 1/121) 
Saying takbir when coming out of one's house to the prayer place and until the imam came out was something that was well known among the salaf (early generations). This has been narrated by a number of scholars such as Ibn Abi Shaybah, ‘Abd a l-Razzaq and al-Firyabi in Ahkam al-’Eidayn from a group of the salaf. For example, Nafi’ ibn Jubayr used to recite takbir and was astonished that the people did not do so, and he said, “Why do you not recite takbir?” 
Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri (may Allah have mercy on him) used to say, “The people used to recite takbir from the time they came out of their houses until the imam came in.” 
Time for takbir on ‘Eid al-Fitr
The time for takbir on ‘Eid al-Fitr starts from the night before ‘Eid until the imam enters to lead the ‘Eid prayer . 
Time for takbir on ‘Eid al-Adha
In the case of ‘Eid al-Adha, the takbir begins on the first day of Dhu’l-Hijjah and lasts until sunset on the last of the days of tashriq. 
Description of the takbir 
It was narrated in the Musannaf of Ibn Abi Shaybah with a sahih isnad from Ibn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him) that he used to recite takbir during the days of tashriq: 
Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar, la ilaha ill-Allah, wa Allahu akbar, Allah akbar, wa Lillah il-hamd (Allah is Most Great, Allah is most Great, there is no god but Allah, Allah is Most great, Allah is most great, and to Allah be praise). 
It was also narrated elsewhere by Ibn Abi Shaybah with the same isnad, but with the phrase “Allahu akbar” repeated three times. 
Al-Mahamili narrated with a sahih isnad also from Ibn Mas’ud: “Allahu akbaru kabira, Allahu akbaru kabira, Allahu akbar wa ajallu, Allahu akbar wa Lillah il-hamd (Allah is Most Great indeed, Allah is Most Great indeed, Allah is most Great and Glorified, Allah is Most Great and to Allah be praise).” (See al-Irwa, 3/126) 
4.               Offering congratulations 
The etiquette of ‘Eid also includes the congratulations and good wishes exchanged by people , no matter what the wording, such as saying to one another Taqabbala Allah minna wa minkum (May Allah accept (good deeds) from us and from you” or “‘Eid mubaarak” and other permissible expressions of congratulations. 
Jubayr ibn Nufayr said: “When the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) met one another on the day of ‘Eid, they would say to one another, “May Allah accept (good deeds) from us and from you.” Ibn Hajar said, its isnad is hasan. (Al-Fath, 2/446) 
Offering congratulations was something that was well known among the Companions, and scholars such as Imam Ahmad and others allowed it. There is evidence which suggests that it is prescribed to offer congratulations and good wishes on special occasions, and that the Sahabah congratulated one another when good things happened, such as when Allah accepted the repentance of a man, they went and congratulated him for that, and so on. 
Undoubtedly these congratulations are among the noble characteristics among the Muslims. 
The least that may be said concerning the subject of congratulations is that you should return the greetings of those who congratulate you on ‘Eid, and keep quiet if others keep quiet, as Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If anyone congratulates you, then respond, otherwise do not initiate it. 
5.               Adorning oneself on the occasion of ‘Eid . 
‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said that ‘Umar took a brocade cloak that was for sale in the market and brought it to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and said, “O Messenger of Allah, buy this and adorn yourself with it for ‘Eid and for receiving the delegations.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him, “Rather this is the dress of one who has no share (of piety or of reward in the Hereafter)…” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 948) 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) agreed with ‘Umar on the idea of adorning oneself for ‘Eid, but he denounced him for choosing this cloak because it was made of silk. 
Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had a cloak which he would wear on the two ‘Eids and on Fridays.” (Sahih Ibn Khuzaymah, 1756) 
Al-Bayhaqi narrated with a sahih isnad that Ibn ‘Umar used to wear his best clothes on ‘Eid. 
So a man should wear the best clothes that he has when going out for ‘Eid. 
Can women adorn themselves when they go out for ‘Eid?
With regard to women, they should avoid adorning themselves when they go out for ‘Eid , because they are forbidden to show off their adornments to non-mahram men. It is also haram for a woman who wants to go out to put on perfume or to expose men to temptation, because they are only going out for the purpose of worship. 
6.               Going to the prayer by one route and returning by another. 
Jabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “On the day of ‘Eid, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to vary his route.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 986) 
It was said that the reason for that was so that the two routes would testify for him on the Day of Resurrection, for the earth will speak on the Day of Resurrection and say what was done on it, both good and bad. 
And it was said that it was in order to manifest the symbols of Islam on both routes, or to manifest the remembrance of Allah (dhikr), or to annoy the hypocrites and Jews, and to scare them with the large number of people who were with him. And it was said that it was in order to attend to the people’s needs, to answer their questions, teach them, set an example and give charity to the needy, or to visit his relatives and uphold the ties of kinship.

36445,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/36445,She made several vows but then forgot them,"I made several vows but I cannot remember what they were. What is the expiation for that? Should I feed ten poor persons for each vow that I did not fulfil? But I cannot remember how many vows I made. So what should I do? 

Also, I vowed to do many prayers but I can’t remember what I vowed to do. Is there any expiation for that, or do vows to do prayers have to be fulfilled?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Whoever makes a vow to do an act of worship such as praying, 
    fasting, giving charity etc must fulfil that vow, because the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever vows to obey 
    Allaah, let him do so, and whoever vows to disobey Allaah, let him not do 
    so.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6318. This applies whether the vow was 
    connected to something happening or was made in general terms. 

    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said concerning a 
    vow to do an act of worship: 
These vows are of three 
    types, one of which is obliging oneself to do an act of worship in return 
    for a blessing which one hopes to have or a harmful thing which one seeks to 
    ward off, such as when a person says, “If Allaah heals me then I will fast 
    one month for Allaah.” In this case the act of worship is something which is 
    basically obligatory according to sharee’ah, such as prayer, fasting, 
    charity and Hajj. This vow must be fulfilled according to scholarly 
    consensus. 

    Al-Mughni, 13/622. 

    If you can remember what you vowed to do – such as praying, 
    fasting or giving charity – but you do not know how much you said you would 
    do, then you have to try your best, and do whatever you think is most 
    likely, so that you will have fulfilled your obligations. 

    But if you have forgotten or are uncertain as to whether what 
    you vowed to do was praying or fasting or giving charity, then in this case 
    some of the scholars are of the view that you must do your best to do one of 
    them, and some are of the view that what you must do is to offer kafaarat 
    yameen, for each vow of which you are uncertain. Mughni al-Muhtaaj, 
    6/234; Ghamz ‘Uyoon al-Basaa’ir, 1/211; al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 
    26/201. 
Hence you will know the 
    answer to your second question. A vow to offer a prayer must be fulfilled, 
    so you must do whatever you think is most likely to discharge your 
    obligation. If you are uncertain as to whether you vowed to do twenty 
    prayers or twenty-five, then do twenty-five. 

    It should be noted that we should not make vows, because of 
    the report narrated by al-Bukhaari (6608) and Muslim (1639) from Ibn ‘Umar 
    (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: The Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) disallowed making vows and said: “They do 
    not change anything, all they do is make a miser give [in charity].” 

    And al-Bukhaari (6609) narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah says: 
    ‘A vow does not bring the son of Adam anything that I have not decreed for 
    him, but his vow may coincide with what has been decreed for him, and in 
    this way I cause a miser to spend of his wealth.’”

Virtues of the Day of Sacrifice","Praise be to Allah.When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came to Madinah, he found that they had two days on which they used to play. He said, “Allah has given you two days better than these, the day of al-Fitr and the day of al-Adha.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 1134; classed as sahih by al-Albani in al-Silsilah al-Sahihah, 2021) 
Allah has given this ummah two days for playing and leisure, two days for remembering Allah and thanking Him, and asking Him for forgiveness. 
Types of festivals in Islam
In this world, the believers have three festivals or ‘Eids:  
One ‘Eid which is repeated each week, and two ‘Eids which come once a year. 
The ‘Eid which is repeated every week is Friday (Jumu’ah). 
The ‘Eids which are not repeated, which come only once each year, are: 
1.     ‘Eid al-Fitr, the breaking of the Ramadan fast. This comes upon the completion of the month of Ramadan, which is the third pillar of Islam. When the Muslims have finished fasting the month that is enjoined upon them, Allah has prescribed that they should follow the completion of their fast with a festival on which they gather to thank Allah, remember Him and glorify Him for His guidance. On that ‘Eid it is prescribed for them to pray and give charity. 
2.     The second ‘Eid is ‘Eid al-Adha (the Feast of Sacrifice), which is the tenth day of the month of Dhu’l-Hijjah. This is the greater and better of the two feasts, which comes after the completion of the Hajj, for when the Muslims complete their Hajj they are forgiven. 
Rather Hajj is completed on the Day of ‘Arafah [the 9th of Dhu’l-Hijjah] with the standing in ‘Arafah, which is the major pillar of Hajj, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Hajj is ‘Arafah.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (889) and classed as sahih by al-Albani in Irwa’ al-Ghalil (1064). 
The day of ‘Arafah is the day of ransom from the Fire, when Allah ransoms from Hellfire those who stood at ‘Arafah and Muslims who did not stand at ‘Arafah. Hence the day that follows it is a festival for all Muslims in all regions, those who attended Hajj and those who did not. 
It is prescribed for all of them to draw closer to Allah by means of the ritual of shedding the sacrificial blood. 
Virtues of the Day of Sacrifice
The virtues of this day may be summed up as follows: 
1.     It is the best of days before Allah.
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Zad al-Ma’ad (1/54): 
“The best of days before Allah is the Day of Sacrifice, which is the greatest day of Hajj as it says in Sunan Abi Dawud (1765), where it is narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The greatest of days before Allah is the Day of Sacrifice.” (Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud) 
2.     It is the greatest day of Hajj.
Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stood between the Jamarat on the Day of Sacrifice during his Hajj and said, “This is the greatest day of Hajj .” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1742)
That is because the greatest actions of Hajj take place on this day, when the pilgrims do the following: 
·        Stoning Jamrat al-‘Aqabah
·        Offering the sacrifice
·        Shaving the head or cutting the hair
·        Tawaf (circumambulation of the Ka’bah)
·        Sa’i (running between al-Safa and al-Marwah)
3.     It is the ‘Eid day of the Muslims
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The day of ‘Arafah, the day of Sacrifice, and the days of al-Tashriq are our festival, us Muslims, and they are days of eating and drinking.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 773; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi.

As for the one who cannot afford that and fears that he will not be able to treat co-wives justly, he should settle for just one wife.","Is it Sunnah to have four wives?


Is marriage compulsory in Islam?","Praise be to Allah.Is it Sunnah to have four wives?
Plural marriage is Sunnah for the one who can afford it, and is not obligatory, according to scholarly consensus. (See Al-Mughni, 9/340) 
Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Is plural marriage permissible in Islam or is it Sunnah? 
He replied: 
“Plural marriage is Sunnah for the one who can afford it. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls then marry (other) women of your choice, two or three, or four; but if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one or (slaves) that your right hands possess. That is nearer to prevent you from doing injustice.” [An-Nisa’ 4:3]
And it is Sunnah because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did it. He had nine wives and Allah benefited the Ummah through them. This is one of the things that applied only to him (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Other men are not allowed to have more than four wives. 
There are many benefits in plural marriage for men and women and for the Muslim Ummah as a whole. Plural marriage enables everyone to lower their gaze and guard their chastity, to have many children, and for a man to take care of many women and protect them from the causes of evil and deviation. 
As for the one who cannot afford that and fears that he will not be able to treat co-wives justly, he should settle for just one wife, because Allah says: “but if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one”.  (Fatawa Islamiyyah, 3/202) 
Is marriage compulsory in Islam?
It should be noted that in principle, marriage may be obligatory or recommended , depending on each person’s situation and his need for marriage. 
Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
 With regard to marriage, people are of three categories: 

Those who fear that they may commit prohibited actions if they do not get married. In this case marriage is obligatory according to most of the jurists, because a person has to keep himself chaste and avoid haram things. 
Those for whom it is recommended are those who feel desire but they are certain that they are not going to do prohibited things. For such people marriage is better than devoting oneself to optional acts of worship, because Allah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoined and encouraged marriage, and because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) got married, as did his companions, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his companions only did that which is best. And because the interests served by marriage are many, because it protects one’s religious commitment, and it protects the woman, keeps her chaste and takes care of her, and produces children, and increases the numbers of the Ummah, and will make the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) proud [of the numbers of his Ummah in the Hereafter], and serves other interests, any one of which outweighs the benefits of doing optional acts of worship, so it is better.  
Those who have no desire, either because they were created without desire or because they were created with desire but have now lost it, because of old age or sickness, etc. These people are of two types: 


Those for whom marriage is recommended, because of the general meaning of the evidence which enjoins marriage.
Those for whom devoting themselves to worship is better, because they cannot fulfil the purposes of marriage and they would not be able to keep a wife chaste, which will cause her harm and this means that he will be keeping her without looking after her properly, and he will be taking on obligations and duties that he may not be able to fulfil. 

The evidence which indicates that marriage is encouraged should be understood as referring to those who have desire.

The prayer comes before the khutbah","Praise be to Allah.What is ‘Eid prayer?
The ‘Eid prayer is one where the imam attends and leads the people in praying two rak’ahs. ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The prayer of al-Fitr is two rak’ahs and the prayer of al-Adha is two rak’ahs, complete and not shortened, on the tongue of your Prophet, and the one who fabricates lies is doomed.” Narrated by al-Nasai, 1420 and Ibn Khuzaymah. Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Nasai. 
Abu Sa’id said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to come out on the day of al-Fitr and al-Adha to the prayer place, and the first thing he would do was to offer the prayer. Narrated by al-Bukhari, 956 
How to pray ‘Eid prayer
In the first rak’ah he should say Takbirat al-ihram (say “Allahu akbar” to start the prayer), after which he should say six or seven more takbirs, because of the hadith of ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her), “The takbir of al-Fitr and al-Adha is seven takbirs in the first rak’ah and five takbirs in the second, apart from the takbir of ruku’.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud and classed as sahih by al-Albani in Irwa’ al-Ghalil, 639)  
Then he should recite al-Fatihah, and recite Surat Qaf in the first rak’ah.
 In the second rak’ah, he should stand up saying takbir, and when he has stood up completely he should say takbir five times, and recite Surat al-Fatihah then Surat al-Qamar. 
What to recite in ‘Eid  prayer
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to recite Surat Qaf and Surat al-Qamar during the two ‘Eids . Or if he wishes he can recite Surat al-A’la in the first rak’ah and Surat al-Ghashiyah in the second, because it was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to recite al-A’la and al-Ghashiyah in the ‘Eid prayer . 
The imam should revive the Sunnah by reciting these surahs so that the Muslims will become familiar with the Sunnah. 
Giving khutbah after ‘Eid prayer
After the prayer, the imam should address the people. Part of the khutbah should be addressed specifically to the women , telling them of the things that they should do and warning them against the things that they should avoid, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to do. 
See Fatawa Arkan al-Islam by Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him), p. 398; Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 8/300-316). 
The prayer comes before the khutbah 
One of the rulings of ‘Eid is that the prayer comes before the khutbah, because of the hadith of Jabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah who said, The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came out on the day of al-Fitr and started with the prayer before the khutbah. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 958; Muslim, 885)
Another indication that the khutbah comes after the prayer is the hadith of Abu Sa’id (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to come out to the prayer place on the day of al-Fitr and al-Adha, and the first thing he would start with was the prayer, then he would go and stand facing the people, while the people were sitting in their rows, and he would preach to them and advise them and command them.  If he wanted to send out a military expedition he would do so and if he wanted to tell the people to do something he would do so, then he would leave. 
Abu Sa’id said: The people continued to do that until I went out with Marwan – who was the governor of Madinah – on ‘Eid al-Adha or ‘Eid al-Fitr, and when we came to the prayer-place, there was a minbar that had been built by Kathir ibn al-Salt. When Marwan wanted to ascend it before he prayed, I grabbed his garment and he pushed me away and climbed up and delivered the khutbah before the prayer. I said, “You have changed it, by Allah.”
 He said, “O Abu Sa’id, what you knew has gone.”
 I said, “What I know, by Allah, is better than what I do not know.”
 He said, “The people will not sit and listen to us after the prayer, so we did it before the prayer.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 956)
