Obeying and honouring one's parents is a means of entering Paradise. Respecting and honouring parents brings friendship and love. Respecting and obeying parents is a way of showing gratitude to them because they are the ones who brought you into this world.,Importance of honouring parents in Islam,"Praise be to Allah.Importance of honouring parents in Islam

Honouring parents in Islam is obedience to Allah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):

“And We have enjoined on man to be good and dutiful to his parents?” [al-Ankabut 29:8]
“And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. And that you be dutiful to your parents. If one of them or both of them attain old age in your life, say not to them a word of disrespect, nor shout at them but address them in terms of honour. And lower unto them the wing of submission and humility through mercy, and say: My Lord! Bestow on them Your Mercy as they did bring me up when I was young.” [al-Isra 17:23]
In al-Sahihayn, Ibn ‘Abbas said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was asked which deed is the best? He said: “ Faith in Allah and His Messenger, then honouring one's parents.” There are many other verses and Mutawatir hadiths which say similar things.

Obeying and honouring one's parents is a means of entering Paradise, as it was reported in Sahih Muslim from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “He is doomed, he is doomed, he is doomed. It was said, Who, O Messenger of Allah? He said, “The person whose parents, one or both of them, reach old age during his lifetime but he does not enter Paradise.”  (Sahih Muslim, 4627).
Respecting and honouring parents brings friendship and love.
Respecting and obeying parents is a way of showing gratitude to them because they are the ones who brought you into this world. You should also show gratitude towards them for bringing you up and taking care of you when you were young. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):

“And We have enjoined on man (to be dutiful and good) to his parents.” [Luqman 31:14]

If a person honours his parents, this may be the cause of his own children honouring him. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):

“Is there any reward for good other than good?” [al-Rahman 55:60]

5333,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/5333,Paying the girl’s dowry with her brother’s money,"Suppose if a parents have Son and Daughter and after long search they found a husband for their daughters but bridegroom is requesting for a dowry but the parents are not affordable to pay them, so they try to get dowry for their son in order to pay for their daughter. Certainly they are not going to use this money except to give dowry for their daughter marriage.  

I like to through some lights and give us proper guidence to handle this situation.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is very strange indeed that in some 
    countries the dowry is paid by the bride or her family to the groom or his family. This is contrary to the Islamic principle, because the 
    Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded a man who was getting married to give a dowry even if it was an iron ring, 
    and when he did not even have that, he made the dowry that he would teach her what he had memorized of the Qur’aan. 
What is important is that in the marriage 
    contract something should be mentioned as the dowry, even if it is little. 
It was narrated that Sahl ibn Sa’d said: A 
    woman came to the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: “I give myself to you (in marriage).” He paused 
    for a while, then a man said, “Marry her to me, if you have no need of her.” He said, “Do you have anything you can give to her as a dowry?” He 
    said, “I do not have anything but my izaar (lower garment).”  He said, “If you give that to her, you will not have any lower garment. Think of 
    something.” He said, “I cannot think of anything.” He said, “Think of something, even if it is an iron ring.” But he did not have anything. (The 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)) said, “Have you memorized anything of the Qur’aan?” He said, “Yes, Soorah such and such, 
    and Soorah such and such” – and he named the soorahs. He said: “We marry her to you on the basis of what you have memorized of the Qur’aan [i.e., 
    that you teach it to her].” 
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4842; Muslim, 
    1425) 
This hadeeth indicates that the Messenger 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not agree to the man marrying without a dowry to give to the woman; he did not ask the woman 
    for anything. 
Moreover, the concept of qawaamah (being 
    maintainers and protectors of women) that Allaah has enjoined on men implies that the man is the one who gives the mahr to the woman, because he 
    is her supporter and she is his dependent.  
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Men are the protectors and maintainers of 
    women, because Allaah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means”
[al-Nisa’ 4:34]
Moreover, the mahr is the woman’s right, because the man enjoys 
    intimate relations with her, and the mahr is paid in return for that intimacy. 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“…so with those of whom you have enjoyed 
    sexual relations, give them their Mahr as prescribed…”
[al-Nisa’ 4:24]
Imam Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
The phrase “so with those of whom you have 
    enjoyed sexual relations, give them their Mahr as prescribed” means, as you are going to enjoy intimacy with them, then give them their 
    dowries in return for that, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And how could you take it (back) while 
    you have gone in unto each other”
[al-Nisa’ 4:21] 
“And give to the women (whom you marry) 
    their Mahr (obligatory bridal-money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage) with a good heart”
[al-Nisa’ 4:4] 
“And it is not lawful for you (men) to 
    take back (from your wives) any of your Mahr (bridal-money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage) which you have given them”
[al-Baqarah 2:229]
Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 
    1/475 
It was narrated from ‘Aa’ishah that the Messenger of Allaah  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Any woman who gets married without the permission of her guardian, her marriage is invalid, her 
    marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid. If the marriage has been consummated then the mahr is hers, because she has permitted (the man) to 
    be intimate with her. If (the guardian) refuses to arrange her marriage, then the ruler is the guardian of the one who has no guardian.” 
Abu ‘Eesa al-Tirmidhi said: this is a hasan 
    hadeeth. 
From this we can see that the dowry is to be 
    paid by the man to the woman, not by the woman to the man. 
Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Qa’ood said: “The mahr 
    is the right of the wife, and it must be defined. The wife or her family do not have to pay anything unless they do so voluntarily.” 
Based on this, it is not permissible for you 
    to take from your son’s money and give it as a dowry for your daughter. Shaykh al-Barraak said: 
“If it is not permissible for the son to take 
    the dowry in the first place, it is not permissible to take it for the daughter.”  
If you fear Allaah, Allaah will grant a way 
    out for your daughter. So she has to be patient and seek reward, and turn to Allaah and make du’aa’. If a person thinks of Allaah in positive 
    terms, he will find that Allaah is as he thinks. 
The scholars, prominent figures and the 
    ordinary people in your country have to strive to change this bad custom and follow the Sunnah, and to do the right thing and follow the right way 
    which no one is permitted to go against. That is by establishing proof to the people from the Qur’aan and Sunnah and the words of the scholars.

But if your husband knows that a particular person will not fulfil a trust or will take a long time to repay a loan, there is no sin on him if he declines to lend him money or books.
But if a person is in difficulty and has no money, it is better to give him more time and treat him with kindness. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And if the debtor is in a hard time (has no money), then grant him time till it is easy for him to repay…” [al-Baqarah 2:280].
If you ask for your husband’s rights, or if he asks for them himself, there is no sin on him for that, because it is his due, but he should be kind and considerate. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “A man died and it was said to him: ‘What did you used to say (do, i.e., in your lifetime)?’ He said: ‘I used to engage in business with people, and I used to give the rich time to repay their debts and I used to deduct part of the debt for the poor’.

What about a person from the filled row backing up himself for the person who is praying alone in the back?,,,"Praise be to Allah.The following questions were put to the Standing Committee for Academic Research and Issuing Fatwas (al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah li’l-Buhooth al-‘Ilmiyyah wa’l-Iftaa):
A person comes to the prayer and finds the rows full, and the last person in the row is a boy. Can he pull him back to pray beside him, or what?
If he comes and finds that the people are doing rukoo’, is it correct for him to pull someone back when he is in rukoo’, or what?
If the rows are full, and he cannot find anyone to pray with him except for young boys, some of whom have reached the age of discernment and some have not, is it OK for him to pray with them in that row?
The committee replied:
If he finds the row is full, he should wait until someone else comes to stand beside him, and should not pull anyone out of the row. If he can join the row or pray on the imaam’s right, he should do so. As for standing in the row with the boys, if they are of the age of discernment, then it is OK to join their row, because of the reports in al-Saheehayn and elsewhere from Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) who said:
“The orphan and I formed a row behind him, and the old lady stood behind us” – referring to their praying behind the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), when he visited him in his house one morning. If the boys are not yet of the age of discernment, then then praying with them behind the last row is like praying standing alone, and it is not correct to pray standing alone behind a row, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no prayer for the one who stands alone behind the row.”
And Allah is the source of strength. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions, and grant them peace.

5392,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/5392,Compulsory car insurance,"I live in a country where it is
      compulsory for a driver to get a car insurance. If the driver can prove that he drove for
      5 years without claiming any accident (= non claim bonus), the cost of the car insurance
      will be much cheaper.1) I know that car insurance is not lawful in Islam. What a
      Muslim should do knowing that a)it is difficult and expensive for a Muslim family to use
      taxis or public transport b)you can be jailed for driving without a car insurance.2) Some brothers have driven in their countries for 5 years
      without claiming any accident but they cannot prove it (by getting a non claim bonus from
      their former insurance company). Some other brothers did not drive for 5 years without
      claiming any accident. Is it lawful for these brothers to falsify a document (a non claim
      bonus) in order to pay as less money as possible to the insuranc",,,"Praise be to Allah.After discussing this question with Shaykh
    Muhammad Al-Saalih Al-‘Uthaymeen, we came up with the following:
What we understand from the question is that the amount of
    money paid for the insurance is related to the value of the car, i.e. what the car is
    worth when the insurance is taken out. What this person is planning to do is a kind of
    lying, but it is done for the purpose of reducing the unfairness to which he is being
    subjected, namely being compelled to take out Haraam insurance. If there is no harm caused
    to him or to the reputation of the Muslims by his doing this, then there is no sin on him
    if he does that because he is forced to. And Allaah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
5393,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/5393,"Her
    parents are threatening to hit her if she covers her face","I am a moslam woman from XXX,I wear higab
    (cover my hear).
I belive that I have to cover my face but my mother and father think that
    higab is to cover my hear only I try my best to convince them but no use. my mother
    threaten me to hit if I ever mention it agin. I don't know what to do I am in bad need for
    any advice.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Know that wearing hijaab is a duty for women, and it is not
    optional. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
 and to draw their veils all over Juyubihinna (i.e., their
    bodies, faces, necks and bosoms, etc.) [al-Noor 24:31]
and:
 and do not display yourselves like that of the times of
    ignorance [al-Ahzaab 33:33]
Know that the complete hijaab which you are observing is something which
    is very good, so you should thank Allaah for it and ask Him to make you steadfast. Be
    steadfast and Allaah will strengthen your heart.
What your mother has told you about hijaab meaning to cover the hair only
    is not correct. A womans beauty is in her face, not only in her hair, and Allaah has
    commanded that her beauty should be covered, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):
 and not to reveal their adornment [beauty]
    [al-Noor 24:31]. The focal point of beauty is the face, so it must be covered,
    according to the most correct view among the scholars.
Know that Allaah is testing you by means of your mother, so see whether
    you will obey Him or her.
You have to advise your mother in a number of ways, including the
    following:
Speaking to her directly, or giving her a tape by one of the scholars
    which clearly outlines the ruling on hijaab, or giving her a book on this topic. Or you
    could call one of the shaykhs on the phone and ask your mother to listen to his answer; or
    take your mother to an Islamic lecture where the correct ruling on this issue will be
    discussed  or some other means.
If you are patient, keep hammering the point and pray to Allaah to open
    her heart at the times when duaas are answered, you will get results in sha
    Allaah. If your mother does not respond, then you do not have to obey her in this
    particular matter, because the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
    Obedience is only in matters that are right and good. And there is no
    obedience to any created being if it involves disobedience to the Creator. At the same
    time, you have to be kind and respectful towards her, because Allaah says (interpretation
    of the meaning):
As for those who strive hard in Us (Our Cause), We will surely
    guide them to Our Paths (i.e., Allaahs Religion  Islamic Monotheism). And
    verily, Allaah is with the Muhsinoon (good doers). [alAnkaboot 29:69]
and:
O you who believe! Endure and be more patient (than your enemy),
    and guard your territory by stationing army units permanently at the places from which the
    enemy can attack you, and fear Allaah, so that you may be successful. [Aal
    Imraan 3:200].

    watching men on TV with no desire","is it haram to watch the T.V and there is
    televisor male in and I watch the news or any program with no other reason. is it Haram to
    watch male in t.v with no(shahwa)",,,"Praise be to Allah.The Muslim has to protect his senses and faculties from
    everything that is of no benefit to him, let alone whatever is haraam. Allaah says
    (interpretation of the meaning):
“Verily, the hearing, and the sight, and the heart, of each of
    those you will be questioned (by Allaah).” [al-Israa’ 17:36]
The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
    “Looking is one of the arrows of Shaytaan.” Television is full of men and women
    who are promiscuous and immoral, and usually is not free from music and all other kinds of
    haraam things, so in general it is not good to look at it. May Allaah help us.
As regards women looking at what normally appears of men for a specific
    reason and without any kind of desire, this is permissible as a number of scholars have
    said. But looking at the TV does not come under this heading, because there is no need for
    it, so women should turn away from everything in which there is no benefit, and keep
    themselves busy with things that will bring good consequences. And Allaah is the source of
    strength.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
