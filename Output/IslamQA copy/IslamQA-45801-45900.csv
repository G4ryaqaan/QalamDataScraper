45804,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45804,The people of Hell will abide therein forever,"Will the torment of the people of Hell in Hell be neverending, or will there come a time when it will end?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The people of Hell will remain in Hell being tormented without end. This is indicated by a great deal of evidence from the Quran and Sunnah. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was asked: Is Hell eternal or will it come to an end? 
He replied: 
What is definite is that it is eternal, and no other view is known among the salaf. Hence the scholars made this one of their tenets of faith, so that we believe that Hell is eternal and will last forever. This is a matter concerning which there is no doubt, because Allah has mentioned the eternal nature of Hell in three places in the Quran: 
1 – In Soorat al-Nisa, where He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, those who disbelieve and did wrong [by concealing the truth about Prophet Muhammad and his message of true Islamic Monotheism written in the Tawraatt (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel) with them]; Allah will not forgive them, nor will He guide them to any way.
Except the way of Hell, to dwell therein forever”
[al-Nisa’ 4:168-169]
2 – In Soorat al-Ahzaab, where He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, Allah has cursed the disbelievers, and has prepared for them a flaming Fire (Hell)
Wherein they will abide for ever”
[al-Ahzaab 33:64] 
3 – In Soorat al-Jinn, where He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and whosoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, then verily, for him is the fire of Hell, he shall dwell therein forever”
[al-Jinn 72:23] 
If Allah had mentioned the eternal nature of Hell in one place, that would have been sufficient, so how about if He has mentioned it in three places? It is strange that a group of scholars are of the view that Hell will cease to exist, based on false arguments which go against what is indicated by the Quran and Sunnah, and they misinterpreted the meanings of the Quran and Sunnah and said that the words “dwell therein forever” mean for as long as it exists. 
How can this be correct? If they are to dwell therein forever, that means that Hell itself must last forever, as they will be in it. If a person is to dwell in some place forever, then the place where he will be must last forever as well, because if that place will cease to exist then he cannot dwell forever. The verse is very clear, and the arguments which go against the text are to be rejected. 
This difference of opinion which was narrated from a few scholars is to be rejected, because it goes against the clear text which every believer must believe in. Whoever goes against it because of some argument that he comes up with may be excused before Allah. But whoever studies the texts of the Quran and Sunnah will know that the view that Hell will last forever is the truth which cannot be ignored. 
Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 2/55-56 
It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah: 
There is a great deal of evidence in the Quran and Sunnah to show that Hell will never cease to exist, and that the kaafireen will abide in Hell forever and will never come out of it. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“This, because you took the Revelations of Allah (this Quran) in mockery, and the life of the world deceived you. So this Day, they shall not be taken out from there (Hell), nor shall they be returned to the worldly life (so that they repent to Allah, and beg His Pardon for their sins)”
[al-Jaathiyah 45:35] 
“Surely, those who disbelieved in Our Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), We shall burn them in Fire. As often as their skins are roasted through, We shall change them for other skins that they may taste the punishment”
[al-Nisa’ 4:56] 
“but he whom He sends astray, for such you will find no Awliyaa’ (helpers and protectors) besides Him, and We shall gather them together on the Day of Resurrection on their faces, blind, dumb and deaf; their abode will be Hell; whenever it abates, We shall increase for them the fierceness of the Fire.
That is their recompense, because they denied Our Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) and said: “When we are bones and fragments, shall we really be raised up as a new creation?”
[al-Isra’ 17:97] 
“But those who disbelieved (in the Oneness of Allah – Islamic Monotheism) and denied Our Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), they will be the dwellers of the Fire, to dwell therein forever. And worst indeed is that destination”
[al-Taghaabun 64:10] 
“and whosoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, then verily, for him is the fire of Hell, he shall dwell therein forever”
[al-Jinn 72:23] 
“Verily, the Mujrimoon (criminals, sinners, disbelievers) will be in the torment of Hell to abide therein forever.
(The torment) will not be lightened for them, and they will be plunged into destruction with deep regrets, sorrows and in despair therein.
We wronged them not, but they were the Zaalimoon (polytheists, wrongdoers).
And they will cry: ‘O Malik (Keeper of Hell)! Let your Lord make an end of us.” He will say: “Verily, you shall abide forever.’
Indeed We have brought the truth (Muhammad with the Quran) to you, but most of you have a hatred for the truth”
[al-Zukhruf 43:74-78] 
“And of mankind are some who take (for worship) others besides Allah as rivals (to Allah). They love them as they love Allah. But those who believe, love Allah more (than anything else). If only, those who do wrong could see, when they will see the torment, that all power belongs to Allah and that Allah is Severe in punishment.
When those who were followed disown (declare themselves innocent of) those who followed (them), and they see the torment, then all their relations will be cut off from them.
And those who followed will say: ‘If only we had one more chance to return (to the worldly life), we would disown (declare ourselves as innocent from) them as they have disowned (declared themselves as innocent from) us.’ Thus Allah will show them their deeds as regrets for them. And they will never get out of the Fire”
[al-Baqarah 2:165-167] 
“Verily, those who belie Our Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) and treat them with arrogance, for them the gates of heaven will not be opened, and they will not enter Paradise until the camel goes through the eye of the needle (which is impossible). Thus do We recompense the Mujrimûn (criminals, polytheists, sinners).
Theirs will be a bed of Hell (Fire), and over them coverings (of Hell-fire). Thus do We recompense the Zaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers)”
[al-A’raaf 7:40-41] 
“But those who disbelieve (in the Oneness of Allah — Islamic Monotheism), for them will be the fire of Hell. Neither will it have a complete killing effect on them so that they die nor shall its torment be lightened for them. Thus do We requite every disbeliever!
Therein they will cry: “Our Lord! Bring us out, we shall do righteous good deeds, not (the evil deeds) that we used to do.” (Allah will reply:) “Did We not give you lives long enough, so that whosoever would receive admonition could receive it? And the warner came to you. So taste you (the evil of your deeds). For the Zaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers) there is no helper”
[Faatir 35:36] 
“Truly, Hell is a place of ambush —
 A dwelling place for the Taaghoon (those who transgress the boundary limits set by Allah, like polytheists, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah, hypocrites, sinners, criminals),
They will abide therein for ages.
Nothing cool shall they taste therein, nor any drink.
Except boiling water, and dirty wound discharges —
An exact recompense (according to their evil crimes).
For verily, they used not to look for a reckoning.
But they belied Our Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, and that which Our Prophet brought) completely.
And all things We have recorded in a Book.
So taste you (the results of your evil actions). No increase shall We give you, except in torment”
[al-Naba’ 78:21-30] 
And there are other verses which all indicate that the kuffaar will abide in Hell for eternity and will never come out, and it will never cease to exist. When taken all together this view is very strong and there is no room for misinterpretation .",Islam Q&A
45812,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45812,There is some kind of crusty scab on his eye – what effect does that have on his wudoo’?,"For a while I have been having some secretions in the inner corner of my eye, in the area between the eye and the nose. When they dry up they leave a crusty scab. This happens several times a day and it usually happens when I check my eyes before each wudoo’. I wash them and I pay special attention to my eyes when doing wudoo’. But sometimes I do not do that then I find these secretions and I do not know if they were there before I did wudoo’ and I did not see them, or if they happened after that, or if they were like grains of sand and the like. Please advise me, may Allaah reward you, because this matter is bothering me. Do I have to repeat my wudoo’ if I find something like this?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The inner corner of the eye is that which is next to the nose. Ahmad (22277), Abu Dawood (134) and Ibn Maajah (444) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to wipe the inner corners of his eyes, but this hadeeth was classed as da’eef by al-Albaani in Da’eef Sunan Abi Dawood. 
Al-Teebi said: Wiping it is mustahabb as a means of ensuring that wudoo’ is done properly … because the eye is rarely free of kohl etc or white secretions which gather at the corner of the eye. End quote from ‘Awn al-Ma’bood. 
The Shaafa’is stated that it is obligatory to wash the inner corners of the eyes when doing wudoo’, and to remove whatever secretions may be there that prevent water reaching the skin. Al-Ramli al-Shaafa’i said in Nihaayat al-Muhtaaj (1/168): The inner corners of the eyes must definitely be washed; if there is anything like white secretions on them which prevent water reaching the place which must be washed, then it must be removed and the area beneath it washed. End quote. 
In Asna al-Mataalib by Shaykh Zakariya al-Ansaari, discussing the acts that are recommended in wudoo’, it says (1/43): Similarly the inner corners of the eyes that are next to the nose should be rubbed with the forefingers, the right forefinger for the right eye and the left forefinger for the left eye. The same applies for the outer corners of the eyes, and it is Sunnah to wash them if there is no white secretion that prevents water reaching the skin, otherwise washing them is obligatory as is mentioned in al-Majmoo’. End quote. 
Some of the scholars think that if the secretion is slight, it may be overlooked and that does not affect wudoo’. This is the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him). 
Al-Mardaawi said in al-Insaaf: If there is a little dirt beneath his fingernails which prevents the water from reaching what is beneath it, then his wudoo’ is not valid. This is the view of Ibn ‘Aqeel. 
And it was said that his wudoo’ is valid. This is the correct view, which was described as such in al-Ri’aayah al-Kubra, and by the author of Hawaashi al-Muqni’. This was stated in al-Ifaadaat and was the view towards which al-Musaanif (i.e., Ibn Qudaamah) was inclined. It was also the view favoured by Shaykh Taqiy al-Deen… Shaykh Taqiy ad-Deen said: If there is something of such material anywhere on the body, such as blood, dough and the like, if it is a small amount, then it does not matter. End quote. 
Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni (1/174), after quoting the view of Ibn ‘Aqeel that it is obligatory to remove any dirt that is beneath the fingernails, and that wudoo’ is not valid if it prevents the water reaching what is beneath them: 
It may be that this is not obligatory, because this is usually hidden, and if washing it was obligatory the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would have said so, because it is not permissible for him to delay explaining something at the time when it is needed. End quote.

45815,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45815,Should a traveler pray four rak’ahs with the congregation or pray two rak’ahs on his own?,"I was traveling, then whilst I was on a journey, I stopped to pray Maghrib and ‘Isha’ together and shortened in one of the mosques. After I had prayed Maghrib and intended to pray ‘Isha’, I found that a group had given the iqaamah to pray ‘Isha’ in the mosque. Should I have prayed four rak’ahs with that congregation, or should I have prayed two rak’ahs on my own as I had intended to, and completed my journey?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Prayer in congregation is obligatory for men whether they are 
    at home or traveling. If you find a group of travelers, you should pray 
    ‘Isha’ with them, in the shortened form, otherwise you should pray four 
    rak’ahs in congregation with the people who live there. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
    “The obligation to pray in congregation is not waived for the traveler, 
    because Allaah has enjoined it (prayer in congregation) even at the time of 
    battle, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“When you (O Messenger 
    Muhammad) are among them, and lead them in As-Salaah (the prayer), let one 
    party of them stand up [in Salaah (prayer)] with you taking their arms with 
    them; when they finish their prostrations, let them take their positions in 
    the rear and let the other party come up which have not yet prayed, and let 
    them pray with you”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:102]

    Based on this, if the traveler is in a country other than his 
    own, he has to attend prayer in congregation in the mosque if he hears the 
    adhaan, unless he is far away from the mosque or fears that he will lose his 
    traveling-companions, because of the general meaning of the evidence which 
    indicates that it is obligatory to pray in congregation for the one who 
    hears the adhaan or iqaamah.

45819,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45819,Can he marry the daughter of a woman who was breastfed by his mother?,"A woman was breastfed by my mother twice, and the one who was breastfed alongside her was my older sister. I had not been born yet. The woman who had been breastfed by my mother got married, and she has a daughter. Is it permissible for me to marry her (the daughter)?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.If a woman 
    breastfeeds a child, then this child becomes her child through radaa’ah 
    (breastfeeding), and a brother through breastfeeding of all her children, 
    whether those children were there before him or came later. 
Based on 
    this, any woman who was breastfed by your mother is your sister through 
    breastfeeding, and you are a maternal uncle to all her children. So it is 
    haraam for you to marry her daughter, because you are her maternal uncle 
    through breastfeeding. And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) said: “What becomes mahram (forbidden for marriage) through 
    breastfeeding is that which become mahram through blood ties.” Narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari, 2645; Muslim, 1447. 
It is haraam 
    for a maternal uncle through blood ties to marry his sister’s daughter, and 
    the same applies to the maternal uncle through breastfeeding. 
But it 
    should be noted that becoming a mahram through breastfeeding can only be 
    established through five well-known breastfeedings, because of the report 
    narrated by Muslim (1452) from ‘Aa’ishah who said: ““When the Qur’aan was 
    first revealed, the number of breast-feedings that would make a child a 
    relative (mahram) was ten, then this was abrogated and replaced with the 
    number of five which is well-known.” 
You state in 
    your question that this woman breastfed from your mother twice, so we should 
    note that the breastfeeding which makes the child a mahram is five 
    feedings. 
Ibn 
    al-Qayyim said in Zaad al-Ma’aad, 5/575: 
One 
    breastfeeding (rad’ah) means when the child takes the beast and starts 
    suckling, and then lets it go without being made to do so. That is one 
    breastfeeding, because the Lawgiver referred to one breastfeeding in general 
    terms, so it is to be interpreted according to custom, and this is the 
    custom. If the child stops briefly in order to breathe or to rest or because 
    of some distraction, then quickly goes back to the breast, this is regarded 
    as one breastfeeding, just as when a person who is eating pauses briefly 
    then quickly goes back to eating, this is not regarded as two meals, rather 
    it is one. This is the view of al-Shaafa’i.  And if the infant moves from 
    one breast to the other, this is one breastfeeding.  
See also 
    question no. 2864  
Thus it becomes clear 
    that the five breastfeedings could all take place in one sitting. 
If this 
    woman was breastfed by your mother five times in this sense, then it is not 
    permissible for you to marry her daughter, because you are her paternal 
    uncle through breastfeeding. If she was breastfed less than five times, that 
    does not mean that she is a mahram, so it is permissible for you to marry 
    her daughter. 
If there is 
    any doubt concerning the number of breastfeedings, whether it was five or 
    not, there is no proof of the child being a mahram in the case of doubt. 
Ibn Qudaamah 
    (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
If there is 
    any doubt as to whether breastfeeding took place or not, or with regard to 
    the number of breastfeedings, whether the number that makes the child a 
    mahram was completed or not, this does not make the child a mahram, because 
    the basic assumption is that he is not a mahram, and what is certain cannot 
    be dispelled by what is uncertain.

45820,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45820,How long was Maryam pregnant with ‘Eesa (peace be upon him)?,"Was the virgin Maryam pregnant with ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) for nine months? Or when the angels came to her and told her to take refuge at the trunk of the palm tree, did she give birth to him at that point?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The scholars differed as to how long 
    Maryam was pregnant with ‘Eesa (peace be upon him). 
The view of the majority is that it was 
    nine months, as with all other humans. 
‘Ikrimah said: Eight months, and said: For 
    that reason no child born at eight months’ gestation lives, so as to 
    preserve the uniqueness of ‘Eesa. 
It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas said: No 
    sooner did she become pregnant but she gave birth. 
Ibn Katheer said (3/117) concerning this 
    report narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas: 
This is strange, and appears to have been 
    taken from the apparent meaning of the verses in which Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So she conceived him, and she withdrew with 
    him to a far place (i.e. Bethlehem valley about 4-6 miles from Jerusalem).
And the pains of childbirth drove her to 
    the trunk of a date palm”
[Maryam 19:22] 
The particle fa (translated here as 
    ‘and’), in Arabic, implies a succession of events, but things follow one 
    another at their own pace, as in the verse where Allaah says (interpretation 
    of the meaning): 
“And indeed We created man (Adam) out of 
    an extract of clay (water and earth).
Thereafter We made him (the offspring of 
    Adam) as a Nutfah (mixed drops of the male and female sexual discharge and 
    lodged it) in a safe lodging (womb of the woman).
Then We made the Nutfah into a clot (a 
    piece of thick coagulated blood), then We made the clot into a little lump 
    of flesh, then We made out of that little lump of flesh bones”
[al-Muminoon 23:12-14] 
Here the particle fa (translated as 
    ‘then’) indicates succession at the appropriate pace. 
And it is proven in al-Saheehayn (al-Bukhari 
    and Muslim) that between each two stages is a period of forty days [i.e., it 
    remains a nutfah for forty days, then a clot for forty days, then a lump of 
    flesh for forty days].  
And Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 
“See you not that Allaah sends down water 
    (rain) from the sky, and then the earth becomes green?”
[al-Hajj 22:63] 
The well-known view is the apparent 
    meaning– and Allaah is able to do all things – which is that she bore him as 
    all other women bear their children. Hence when the signs of pregnancy 
    appeared on her, and there was with her in the mosque a righteous man from 
    among her relatives who worshipped in the temple with her, who was called 
    Yoosuf al-Najjaar.  When he saw that her belly had become swollen he 
    found it strange. Then he decided to think well of her because of what he 
    knew of her innocence, honour, religious commitment and worship. Then he 
    thought about her situation, and he could not stop thinking about this 
    matter. So he said, speaking indirectly: “O Maryam, I am going to ask you 
    about something, so do not get alarmed.” She said, “What is it?” He said: 
    “Has any tree or plant ever grown without a seed? Has any child ever been 
    born without a father?” She said: “Yes, I understood what you are referring 
    to. As for your asking whether any tree or plant has ever grown without a 
    seed, when Allaah first created trees and plants He created them without 
    seeds. And has any child ever been born without a father? Allaah created 
    Adam without either a father or a mother.” So he believed her and left her 
    alone. 
When Maryam felt that her people were 
    accusing her, she withdrew to a far place, i.e. far away from them, so that 
    she would not see them and they would not see her. 
Muhammad ibn Ishaaq said: When she became 
    pregnant with him and her menses ceased, and she experienced the discomforts 
    that all pregnant women face, then no household experienced what the 
    household of Zakariyah experienced. Talk spread among the Children of Israel 
    and they said that the one who was responsible for this was her companion 
    Yoosuf because there was no one else in the church with her except him. So 
    she stayed away from people and put a screen between her and them so that no 
    one could see her and she could not see anyone.

My question now is, what should I do in this jungle, without incurring the wrath of Allaah?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
      Offering sincere advice to the slaves of Allaah is one of 
      the most important branches of faith and symbols of Islam, to such an 
      extent that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
      described it as being the religion itself, as an indication of its great 
      importance. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
      said: “Religion is sincerity (or sincere advice – naseehah).” 
      (Narrated by Muslim, 55). And Allaah tells us that whoever does this, that 
      is true success. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Let there arise out 
    of you a group of people inviting to all that is good (Islam), enjoining 
    Al-Ma‘roof (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do) and 
    forbidding Al-Munkar (polytheism and disbelief and all that Islam has 
    forbidden). And it is they who are the successful”

    [Aal ‘Imraan 3:104]

    So long as you fulfilled your duty of offering sincere 
    advice, and your intention was good, then do not feel sad about the problems 
    that have befallen you (which is a test), for Paradise is the reward of 
    Allaah, and the reward of Allaah is precious and is surrounded with 
    hardships, and everything has a price. 

    Remember that everyone who does this great duty will 
    inevitably meet with harm from people, or opposition. Hence Luqmaan the Wise 
    said to his son: 
“O my son! Aqim‑is‑Salaah 
    (perform As‑Salaah), enjoin (on people) Al‑Ma‘roof  (Islamic Monotheism and 
    all that is good), and forbid (people) from Al‑Munkar (i.e. disbelief in the 
    Oneness of Allaah, polytheism of all kinds and all that is evil and bad), 
    and bear with patience whatever befalls you. Verily, these are some of the 
    important commandments (ordered by Allaah with no exemption)”

    [Luqmaan 31:17]

    Remember that the good end is for the pious (those who fear 
    Allaah), and Allaah will not cause the reward of those who do good to be 
    lost, and He is with those who are patient. So turn to Him and seek His 
    protection, and say Allaah (Alone) is Sufficient for me, and He is the Best 
    Disposer of affairs (for me). Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Those (i.e. believers) unto whom the people (hypocrites) 
    said, ‘Verily, the people (pagans) have gathered against you (a great army), 
    therefore, fear them.’ But it (only) increased them in Faith, and they said: 
    ‘Allaah (Alone) is Sufficient for us, and He is the Best Disposer of affairs 
    (for us).’

    174. So they returned with grace and bounty from Allaah. 
    No harm touched them; and they followed the good Pleasure of Allaah. And 
    Allaah is the Owner of great bounty”

    [Aal ‘Imraan 3:174-175]

    No matter how much they plot against you, their plot will 
    backfire on them. 

    “But the evil plot encompasses only him who makes it”

    [Faatir 35:43]
So receive the glad 
    tidings of the help and support of Allaah, make a lot of du’aa’ and pray for 
    forgiveness. Remember that the prayer of the one who has been wronged or 
    oppressed is not rejected, as the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “There are three whose prayers will undoubtedly be 
    answered: the prayer of a father, the prayer of a traveller, and the prayer 
    of one who has been wronged.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 1536; al-Tirmidhi, 
    1905; Ibn Maajah, 3862; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi 
    Dawood.

    leave this job and relieve yourself of that in which there is evil and harm,

If you cannot move from 
    this place, then try to take a leave of absence for a while until things 
    calm down; Allaah may cause things to change. 
If you can do without 
    this job altogether, and save yourself from all this trouble and heartache 
    and devote your efforts to taking care of your house and children, then this

45839,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45839,The virtue of reading Quran at night when people are asleep,What is the virtue of reading the Quran at night when people are asleep?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.It is proven in the saheeh Sunnah that the Quran will intercede for those who read it at night, as Ahmad (6626) narrated from ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Fasting and the Quran will intercede for a person on the Day of Resurrection. Fasting will say, ‘O Lord, I deprived him of his food and his desires during the day, so let me intercede for him.’ And the Quran will say: ‘I deprived him of his sleep at night so let me intercede for him.’ Then they will intercede.” Narrated by Ahmad; classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, no. 3882. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stated that reading the Quran at night is one of the blessings that the believer is to be envied for. He said: “There should be no envy except in two cases: a man to whom Allah teaches the Quran, so he recites it during the night and during the day, and his neighbour hears him and says, ‘Would that I had been given what So and so has been given and I could do what he does, and a man to whom Allah gives wealth so he spends it all for the sake of the truth, and a man says, ‘Would that I had been given what So and so has been given and I could do what he does.’” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 4738. 
Reading Quran at night saves one from negligence, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever reads ten verses at night will not be recorded as one of the negligent.” Narrated by al-Haakim, who said it is saheeh according to the conditions of Muslim. Al-Albani said in Saheeh al-Targheeb wa’l-Tarheeb (640): It is saheeh because of corroborating reports. 
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever observes these prescribed prayers regularly will not be recorded as one of the negligent, and whoever reads one hundred verses in a night will be recorded as one of the devout.” Narrated by Ibn Khuzaymah in his Saheeh, and by al-Haakim, who said it is saheeh according to the conditions of both (al-Bukhaari and Muslim). It was also classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Targheeb wa’l-Tarheeb, 640. 
Allah has described the pious as follows (interpretation of the meaning): 
“They used to sleep but little by night [invoking their Lord (Allah) and praying, with fear and hope].

This is the title that Al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) gave to a chapter in Kitab Al-Maghazi in his Sahih: “The last words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)”, where he quoted the Hadith of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: 
When the Prophet was healthy, he used to say, “No soul of a Prophet is taken until he has been shown his place in Paradise and then he is given the choice.” When death approached him while his head was on my thigh, he became unconscious and then recovered consciousness. He then looked at the ceiling of the house and said, “O Allah! (with) the highest companions."" I said (to myself), “He is not going to choose (to stay with) us.” Then I understood what he meant when he said that to us when he was healthy. The last words he spoke were, ""O Allah! (with) the highest companions.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 4463; Muslim, 2444)
There is a report narrated by Ahmad (1691) from the Hadith of Abu `Ubaydah (may Allah be pleased with him), who said that the last words that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) spoke were, “Expel the Jews of the Hijaz and Najran from the Arabian Peninsula, and know that the most evil of people are those who took the graves of their Prophets as places of worship.” This was classed as authentic by Al-Albani in As-Sahihah, 1132. 
And Abu Dawud (5156)and Ibn Majah (2698) narrated that `Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The last words that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) spoke were, “The prayer, the prayer! And fear Allah with regard to those whom your right hands possess.” This was classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud. And there are other similar Hadiths. 
What is meant by these reports is that these are some of the last things that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, or they were the last pieces of advice that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) gave to his family and companions, and those who would be in authority after he was gone. These Hadiths are among the last things he said, but the Hadith of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) is the last of all. (See Fayd Al-Qadir by Al-Manawi, 5/250 – 251) 
As-Suhayli (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The reason why these – “O Allah, (with) the higher companions” – were the last words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is because they refer both to Tawhid and to Dhikr in the heart. It offers comfort to those who are unable to speak (when dying), because some people may not be able to speak out loud for some reason, but that does not matter if their hearts are steadfast in remembering Allah.” (Quoted by Al-Hafiz in Al-Fath, 8/138)

45847,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45847,He has taken on the responsibility and feels anxious and depressed,"Firstly, I am a young man, 20 years old, and am studying in the Faculty of Medicine. My father died recently, most of the responsibilities have fallen on my shoulders. I have a brother who is older than me but he is disabled. A few days ago I went through a psychological crisis. I started feeling afraid of sickness and death, and thinking that I would die that day, and other such strange thoughts. I went to a psychiatrist and he said to me: “You are suffering from anxiety and depression.” He gave me some medicine but I am not taking it.
I started to follow the teachings of Islam, praise be to Allaah, and I turned to Allaah and now, praise be to Allaah, I feel much better. I am also reading Qur’aan and praying in the mosque. My question is: in this situation do I need to take medicine or not? Is this from the Shaytaan or is it a nervous disease?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The believer cannot do without his Lord. He is the only One Who can bring benefits or ward off harm. By turning to Allaah you did the right thing. 
Death is a reality, and Allaah has decreed it for every soul, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Everyone shall taste death”
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:185]
No matter how hard a person tries, he can never ward off that which Allaah has willed and decreed for him, namely death. 
But fear should not prevent a person from worshipping and obeying Allaah, rather it should do the opposite. Fear should motivate one to worship and obey Allaah. Fear – as Ibn Qudaamah said – is the whip of Allaah with which He drives His slaves to persist in seeking knowledge and acting upon it, so that they may attain the status of being close to Allaah. 
Fear may cause a person to become worried, anxious or ill, which may in turn cause him to despair of the mercy of Allaah; in this case his fear is not something good, it is bad. 
It should be noted that a lot of worry and psychological stress is caused by not being content (with the will and decree of Allaah). We may not get what we want, and even if we do get what we want that may not make us feel content as we had hoped; the idea that we had in our minds before getting it was better than the reality. 
Even after getting what we want we may still suffer from anxiety and fear of losing that blessing. There is no remedy for this apart from accepting the decree of Allaah, thanking Him for His blessings and patiently bearing the difficulties and calamities that Allaah has decreed for us.   
Your situation may require a doctor, but you should note that most people’s diseases are not physical, rather they are psychosomatic. 
Dr al-Faarez says: It became clear that for four out of five patients their sickness had no physical basis at all, rather their sickness stemmed from fear, anxiety, resentment and selfishness, and a person’s inability to create harmony between himself and life.  
Look at how Ya’qoob (peace be upon him) wept for his son Yoosuf (peace be upon him) and lost his sight. Look at how distress overwhelmed ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) when the people slandered her by telling lies about her, and she kept weeping so much that she said: “I though that grief would tear me apart.” Agreed upon. 
Dr Hassaan Shamsi Pasha said:  
In the event of anxiety, secretion of a substance called adrenaline increases in the blood, the blood pressure rises, the heart rate increases, and a person feels heart palpitations or may feel as if something is sinking to the bottom of his chest. 
He may become paranoid and rush from one doctor to another, wondering what is wrong with his heart, when there is nothing wrong in his body but he still suffers pain in his stomach and has indigestion, or bloating in his abdomen, or frequent urination or headaches. 
You have to have faith and fear Allaah; always recite dhikr and wirds that are prescribed in sharee’ah, because this is one of the greatest remedies that will get rid of the thoughts that are going around in your mind and the things that hearts grieve over. 
Some of the du’aa’s narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that deal with such matters include the following: 
1 – It was narrated from Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to say: “Allaahumma inni a’oodhu bika min al-hammi wa’l-hazani wa’l’ajzi wa’l-kasali wa’l-jubni wa’l-bukhli wa dala’ il-dayn wa ghalbat al-rijaal (O Allaah, I seek refuge with You from worry, grief, incapacity, laziness, cowardice, miserliness, from being heavily indebt and from being overcome by men).” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6008. 
2 – It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If a person who is afflicted by anxiety or sorrow says: ‘Allaahumma inni ‘abduka wa ibnu ‘abdika wa ibn ammatika naasiyati bi yadika maadin fiyya hukmuka ‘adlun fiyya qadaa’uka as’aluka bi kulli ismin huwa laka sammayta bihi nafsaka aw ‘allamtahu ahadan min khalqika aw anzaltahu fi kitaabika aw asta’tharta bihi fi ‘ilm il-ghaybi ‘indaka an taj’al al-Qur’aana rabee’a qalbi wa nooar sadri wa jalaa’a huzni wa dhahaaba hammi (O Allaah, I am Your slave, son of Your slave, son of Your female slave, my forelock is in Your hand, Your command over me is forever executed and Your decree over me is just. I ask You by every name belonging to You with which You have named Yourself, or, or You have taught to any of Your creation, or You have revealed in Your Book, or You have preserved in the knowledge of the Unseen with You, that You make the Qur’aan the life of my heart and the light of my breast, and a departure for my sorrow and a release for my anxiety)’, then Allaah will take away his anxiety and sorrow, and will replace it with joy.”

      Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    Nowadays traders and manufacturers have started to offer too 
    many products, and the people are drowning in stuff. As we see, people have 
    a lot of containers in their houses, or several types of clothing. The 
    companies, as you know, are purely materialistic. They offer prizes to those

    1 – That the price of the item should be the real price, 
    i.e., the price should not be raised because of the prize. If the price has 
    been raised because of the prize then this is gambling and is not 
    permissible. 

    2 – A person should not buy the product because he hopes for 
    the prize. If he buys it only because he hopes to win the prize, and not 
    because he has any need of the product, this is a waste of money. We have 
    heard that some people will buy a carton of milk or yoghurt, which they do 
    not want or need, but they hope to win a prize. So you see them buying these 
    things then throwing them away in the marketplace or outside their homes.

45855,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45855,Islam Began as Something Strange,What is the meaning of this hadeeth (prophetic narration): “Islam began as something strange and will revert to being strange as it began.”?,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    This hadeeth was narrated by Muslim (145) from Abu Hurayrah 
    (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and 
    blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Islam began as something strange and 
    will revert to being strange as it began, so give glad tidings to the 
    strangers.”

    Al-Sindi said in Hashiyat Ibn Majah:

    “Strange” refers to the small number of its adherents. The 
    basic meaning of ghareeb (a stranger) is being far from one's homeland. “And 
    will revert to being strange” refers to the small number of those who will 
    adhere to its teachings even though its followers are many. “So give glad 
    tidings to the strangers” means those who follow its commands. “Tooba (glad 
    tidings)” has been interpreted as meaning Paradise or a great tree in 
    Paradise. This shows that supporting Islam and following its commands may 
    require leaving one's homeland and being patient in bearing the difficulties 
    of being a stranger, as was the case in the beginning.

    In Sharh Saheeh Muslim, Al-Nawawi quoted al-Qadi ‘Iyad as 
    saying concerning the meaning of this hadeeth:

    “Islam began among a few individuals, then it spread and 
    prevailed, then it will reduce in numbers until there are only a few left, 
    as it was in the beginning.”

    It says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 2/170:

    The meaning of this hadeeth is that Islam began as something 
    strange, when the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon 
    him) called people to Islam, but no one responded except a few here and 
    there. At that time it was something strange because its people were like 
    strangers amongst others and they were few in number and weak, in contrast 
    to the great numbers and strength of their enemies who persecuted the 
    Muslims. Then some of them migrated to Abyssinia, fleeing for the sake of 
    their religion from tribulation and to save themselves from persecution and 
    oppression, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon 
    him) migrated at Allah’s command to Madeenah, after suffering intense 
    persecution and in the hope that Allah would give him people to support him 
    in his call and support Islam. Allah fulfilled his hopes, granted victory to 
    his troops and supported His slave. 

    The Islamic state was established and Islam spread, with the 
    help of Allah, throughout the land; Allah made the word of kufr (disbelief) 
    lowest and the word of Allah is (always) uppermost, for Allah is Almighty, 
    All-Wise, and honour, power and glory belong to Allah, and to His Messenger 
    (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and to the believers [cf 
    al-Munafiqoon 63:8]. This continued for a long time, then division and 
    dissent spread among the Muslims and weakness and failure increased 
    gradually, until Islam once again became something strange as it was in the 
    beginning. But this is not because of their small numbers, because at that 
    time they will be many, rather it is because they do not adhere to their 
    religion or cling to the Book of their Lord and the teachings of the 
    Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), apart from 
    those whom Allah wills. So they become distracted and turn to competing in 
    worldly matters, like those who came before them, and they fight amongst 
    themselves for leadership. So the enemies of Islam found a way in and they 
    colonized their lands, humiliated their people and treated them badly. This 
    is the way in which Islam returned to being strange as it was in the 
    beginning.

    A number of scholars – including Shaykh Muhammad Rasheed Rida 
    – thought that this hadeeth gives glad tidings of a second victory of Islam 
    after it becomes something strange again. They base this on the metaphor 
    used by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he said, 
    “… will revert to being strange as it began.” So just as following the 
    initial strangeness and alienation the Muslims were victorious and Islam 
    spread, this will happen again after the second period of strangeness and 
    alienation.

    This view is more likely to be correct, and is supported by 
    what is proven in the ahadeeth (reports) about the Mahdi and the descent of 
    ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) at the end of time, when Islam will spread and the 
    Muslims will be victorious, and kufr and the kafirs (non-Muslims) will be 
    defeated.

    Secondly: 

    With regard to your brother’s wife making fun of those who 
    are religiously-committed and insulting them and mocking them, she should 
    understand that by doing these things she is in serious danger, and that 
    these actions may put her beyond the pale of Islam. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was 
    asked about the ruling on making fun of those who adhere to the commandments 
    of Allaah and His Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him)? 

    He replied: Making fun of those who adhere to the 
    commandments of Allaah and His Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) because of their commitment is haraam and is very dangerous and 
    serious, because there is the fear that his hatred for them may be based on 
    hatred of what they are adhering to, namely the religion of Allaah. In that 
    case mocking them is mocking the path that they are following. They are like 
    those of whom Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“If you ask them (about 
    this), they declare: ‘We were only talking idly and joking.’ Say: ‘Was it at 
    Allaah, and His Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, 
    revelations, etc.) and His Messenger that you were mocking?”

    Make no excuse; you disbelieved after you had believed’”

    [al-Tawbah 9:65-66]

    These words were revealed concerning some of the hypocrites 
    who said: “We have never seen anything like these reciters – meaning the 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his 
    companions – they are the most greedy, the most false of speech and the most 
    cowardly in battle.” Then Allaah revealed this verse concerning them.  

    Those who make fun of the followers of truth because they are 
    religiously-committed should beware, for Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “Verily, (during the worldly life) those who committed 
    crimes used to laugh at those who believed.

    30. And, whenever they passed by them, used to wink one to 
    another (in mockery).

    31. And when they returned to their own people, they would 
    return jesting;

    32. And when they saw them, they said: ‘Verily, these have 
    indeed gone astray!’

    33. But they (disbelievers, sinners) had not been sent as 
    watchers over them (the believers).

    34. But this Day (the Day of Resurrection) those who 
    believe will laugh at the disbelievers

    36. Are not the disbelievers paid (fully) for what they 
    used to do?”

    Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 
    2/question no. 236. 
Insulting a Muslim is a 
    major sin, especially if one insults him for being religiously committed and 
    righteous. There is the fear that the one who does this may fall into 
    apostasy as stated above with regard to mocking them. 

    It was narrated from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “Insulting a Muslim is immorality and killing him is kufr.” 

    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 48; Muslim, 64. 

    Al-Nawawi said: 

    In Arabic the word sabb (translated here as insulting) 
    means slandering a person and speaking of his honour in a disparaging 
    fashion. And fisq (translated here as immorality) means going out; in 
    sharee’ah terminology it means going out of obedience (i.e., transgressing 
    the bounds of obedience). 

    With regard to the meaning of the hadeeth: Insulting a Muslim 
    for no reason is haraam according to the consensus of the ummah, so the one 
    who does that is a faasiq as the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) said. 

    Sharh Muslim, 2/53, 54. 
We advise you to 
    continue advising her, and if that is via your brother, that will be better. 
    Tell him of the Islamic rulings on what she is doing, and encourage him to 
    guide her by whatever means he can. 

    We do not advise you to sit with her unless she repents and 
    turns back to her Lord. We fear that you may react towards her, and we fear 
    that she may increase in sin every time she sees you or sits with you. 

    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And when you (Muhammad) see those who engage in a false 
    conversation about Our Verses (of the Qur’aan) by mocking at them, stay away 
    from them till they turn to another topic. And if Shaytaan (Satan) causes 
    you to forget, then after the remembrance sit not you in the company of 
    those people who are the Zaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers)”

    [al-An’aam 6:68]
But if you speak to her 
    and do not shun her, that may be more beneficial for her because it may 
    soften her heart. You can limit it to greeting and welcoming her, and asking 
    how she is, without indulging in any arguments with her that may lead her to 
    do something haraam. 

    Do not forget – as well as doing what you can to advise her – 
    to pray that she may be guided aright.

Is it permissible for women to listen to songs of joy accompanied by the daff at ordinary times  - i.e., not on occasions of joy?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    In the answers to questions no.
    20406 and
    9290 we have already stated the 
    ruling on the daff, and said that it is permissible for women and not for 
    men to beat it and listen to it. The daff which is permissible is that which 
    is open on one side only. If it is closed on both sides or closed on one 
    side and has a small opening on the other side, then it is more like a 
    tablah (drum). The daff that is permissible is the one that does not have 
    any metal circles either inside it or around the edge. 

    Al-Safaareeni said: 

    If the daff has metal circles, then you have to break it 
    because it is not permissible. Imam Ahmad stated that if you break it, you 
    do not have to offer compensation to the owner. 

    As for the daff that is free of such things, it is 
    permissible for women to use it on occasions other than weddings. 

    Ghidha’ al-Albaab Sharh Manzoomat al-Adaab, 
    1/243. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was 
    asked: 

    There is a kind of drum that is covered on one side, and the 
    other side is mostly covered but has a small opening. Does this count as a 
    kind of daff? 

    He replied: 
This is a kind of drum, 
    and may be worse than an ordinary drum, because with this kind of drum the 
    sound comes out through this opening and vibrates more, so it is more 
    resonant than if it were fully closed or fully open. So it is not 
    permissible to use this as a daff is used, because the daff is undoubtedly 
    less effective than this. This gives a vibrating sound and is more 
    entertaining. 

    Liqaa’aat al-baab al-Maftooh, 
    question no. 1141. 

    The basic principle concerning musical instruments is that 
    they are haraam; an exception is made in the case of the daff on certain 
    occasions. The daff which is exempted is that which does not have any extra 
    things such as rattles or metal circles. We have already discussed the 
    ruling on musical instruments in the answer to question no.
    5000. 

    Secondly: 

    The ahaadeeth which speak of beating the daff mention three 
    occasions: Eid, weddings and the return of one who has been away. You can 
    read the evidence for that in question no.

45864,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45864,"Her father mistreats her and her mother resents her, and this has affected her relationship with her husband","I got married two years ago. My husband – praise be to Allaah – fears Allaah with regard to the way he treats me, but I have a psychological complex because of a father who did not fear Allaah with regard to me, my siblings and my mother, which created resentment in my heart and in my siblings’ hearts towards him. Even though I have got married and moved away from that horrible life, I cannot help but be upset because of my mother’s and siblings’ suffering. They are still suffering and that affects the way I treat my husband who respects me, but his patience sometimes runs out when he sees me so sad most of the time and he thinks that I like to be miserable. What should I do? Also, my siblings and I cannot respect my father because of the way he has treated us; what should we do to rid ourselves of our resentment towards him? We try to respect him, but he does not respect anyone and he suffers from a complex whereby he hates everyone who is better than him, and he loves to show off and to stand out, i.e., he wants to show people that he owns a great deal even though he does not own anything, rather he is in debt. I hope that you can help me to solve this problem.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    With regard to your father, you have to keep on advising him 
    and reminding him of what Allaah has enjoined upon him with regard to 
    himself and to his family. 

    You have to try different methods of advising him. It may be 
    hard for him to hear it from you, but do not despair of reminders and 
    exhortations reaching him by way of your relatives or his friends. You could 
    also let him listen to some useful tapes. 

    Secondly: 

    You have to fear Allaah with regard to your husband. You 
    should not bring the worries of your family into your husband’s house and 
    place them on his shoulders, especially since he treats you well and you do 
    not see anything from him that upsets you. What you have to do is to 
    appreciate him and treat him kindly. This is what Allaah commands you to 
    do. 

    Thirdly: 

    No one is free of diseases – except those on whom Allaah has 
    mercy. The fact that your father likes to show off and to appear to be 
    better than others means that you have to be compassionate towards him, not 
    resent him. The fact that he has treated you badly and is still doing so 
    means that you should show mercy towards him, for if he dies and meets his 
    Lord in that state, then he will meet Him with many sins. 

    Hence you and your siblings and family have to look again at 
    your relationship with your father and your attitude towards him, for Allaah 
    has commanded us to treat parents well and honour them, even if they call us 
    to shirk and kufr. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “But if they (both) strive with you to make you join in 
    worship with Me others that of which you have no knowledge, then obey them 
    not; but behave with them in the world kindly, and follow the path of him 
    who turns to Me in repentance and in obedience. Then to Me will be your 
    return, and I shall tell you what you used to do”

    [Luqmaan 31:15]
Ibraaheem (peace be upon 
    him) debated with his mushrik father politely, as Allaah tells us 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And mention in the Book (the Qur’aan) Ibraaheem 
    (Abraham). Verily, he was a man of truth, a Prophet.

    42. When he said to his father: ‘O my father! Why do you 
    worship that which hears not, sees not and cannot avail you in anything?

    43. ‘O my father! Verily, there has come to me of the 
    knowledge that which came not unto you. So follow me, I will guide you to 
    the Straight Path.

    44. ‘O my father! Worship not Shaytaan (Satan). Verily, 
    Shaytaan (Satan) has been a rebel against the Most Gracious (Allaah).

    45. ‘O my father! Verily, I fear lest a torment from the 
    Most Gracious (Allaah) should overtake you, so that you become a companion 
    of Shaytaan (Satan) (in the Hell-fire).’ 

    46. He (the father) said: ‘Do you reject my gods, O 
    Ibraaheem (Abraham)? If you stop not (this), I will indeed stone you. So get 
    away from me safely (before I punish you).’

    47. Ibraaheem (Abraham) said: ‘Peace be on you! I will ask 
    forgiveness of my Lord for you. Verily, He is unto me Ever Most Gracious’”

    [Maryam 19:41-47]

    Look at the etiquette of this Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) and how he addressed his mushrik father who 
    was threatening his Muslim son. In this there is a great lesson for those 
    who suffer a similar problem with their fathers. 

    Fourthly: 

    With regard to the grief that you feel, it should not make 
    you stop doing things or prevent you from doing acts of worship, or make you 
    fall short in doing that which Allaah has enjoined upon you, such as the 
    duties that Allaah has enjoined upon you towards your husband, or the duty 
    to call your father to Allaah. 

    We advise you to recite a du’aa’ for protection, and another 
    for healing. 

    The du’aa’ for protection is as follows: 

    It was narrated from Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) 
    that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to 
    say: “Allaahumma inni a’oodhu bika min al-hammi wa’l-hazani wa’l’ajzi 
    wa’l-kasali wa’l-jubni wa’l-bukhli wa dala’ il-dayn wa ghalbat al-rijaal 
    (O Allaah, I seek refuge with You from worry, grief, incapacity, laziness, 
    cowardice, miserliness, from being heavily indebt 
    and from being overcome by men).” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6008.  

    The du’aa’ for healing is as follows: 

    It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood said: The 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “If a person who is afflicted by anxiety or sorrow says: ‘Allaahumma inni 
    ‘abduka wa ibnu ‘abdika wa ibn ammatika naasiyati bi yadika maadin fiyya 
    hukmuka ‘adlun fiyya qadaa’uka as’aluka bi kulli ismin huwa laka sammayta

    Your slave, son of Your slave, son of Your female slave, my forelock is in 
    Your hand, Your command over me is forever executed and Your decree over me 
    is just. I ask You by every name belonging to You with which You have named 
    Yourself, or, or You have taught to any of Your creation, or You have 
    revealed in Your Book, or You have preserved in the knowledge of the Unseen 
    with You, that You make the Qur’aan the life of my heat and the light of my 
    breast, and a departure for my sorrow and a release for my anxiety)’, then 
    Allaah will take away his anxiety and sorrow, and will replace it with 
    joy.” 

    It was said: “O Messenger of Allaah, should we not learn it?” 
    He said: “Yes, whoever hears it should learn it.”

45865,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45865,Ruling on Double Entendres,What is the ruling on double entendres?,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    
    Double entendre refers to when a person means something other than the 
    apparent meaning of the words. It is permissible subject to two conditions: 
     

    1 – 
    that the word may be interpreted in that fashion

    2 – 
    that there be no wrongdoing involved. 

    If a 
    man says, “I only sleep on a watd” – a watd is a piece of wood placed on the 
    wall for things to be hung from (i.e., a hook), but the man says that what 
    he meant by watd was a mountain, this is an acceptable kind of double 
    entendre, because the word watd may also mean a mountain, and there is no 
    wrong being done to anyone in this case. 

    
    Similarly if a man says, “I only sleep under the saqaf (lit. roof),” then he 
    sleeps on the roof, and says that what he meant by saqaf was the sky, this 
    is also acceptable, because the sky is called saqaf in the verse where Allah 
    says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And 
    We have made the heaven a roof [saqafan], safe and well-guarded” [21:32] 
But if 
    you use double entendres in order to wrong someone, that is not permitted, 
    such as if a person deprives another of something that is his due, then he 
    goes to the qaadi (judge), but the one who was wronged has no proof, so the 
    qaadi asks the one who took away his right to swear that he does not have 
    anything that belongs to the claimant, and he swears saying, “Wallaahi maa 
    lahu ‘indi shay’,” and the qaadi rules in his favour, then some of the 
    people speak to him and told him that his oath was a false oath (yameen 
    ghamoos) which may doom him to Hell. It says in the hadeeth, “Whoever swears 
    an oath when asked to do so  in order to deprive a Muslim man of his rights 
    unlawfully, will meet Allah when He is angry with him.” The person who swore 
    this oath said, “I did not mean to deny, I meant to affirm, and what I meant 
    by saying “maa lahu” was “Of Whose I have something.” [i.e., I have 
    something that belongs to Allah – because all things belong to Allah]. Even 
    though what he said may mean this, his intention was to wrong another and 
    not give him his due, so it is not permissible. Hence it says in the hadeeth: 
    “Your oath is according to what your companion believes.” Twisting the 
    meaning will not avail you anything before Allah, and you are now swearing a 
    false oath.

    If a 
    man accuses his wife of betraying him and she is innocent of that and he 
    swears an oath and says, “By Allah she is my sister,” and says that he meant 
    she is his sister in Islam, then this is a valid statement, because she is 
    his sister in Islam and she has been falsely accused.

How to wipe the head in Wudu","Praise be to Allah.Is there a specific way to wash or wipe the parts of Wudu? 
The way in which parts of the body are washed or wiped over in Wudu is not obligatory. What is obligatory is to wash the parts that are to be washed, and to wipe the parts that are to be wiped, in any manner that it is achieved. But undoubtedly following the way which is narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is better and more perfect. (See Al-Mughni, 1/171) 
How to wipe the head in Wudu
Two ways of wiping over the head in Wudu have been narrated: 

After wetting the hands in water, you place them at the front of the head and wipe the head until you reach the back of the head, then you bring them back to the front of the head. 

An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Muslim that the scholars unanimously agreed that this is recommended. 
This is proven in a number of Hadiths from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
Al-Bukhaari (185) and Muslim (235) narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn Zayd (may Allah be pleased with him) that he described the Wudu of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): … Then he wiped his head with his hands , front to back. He started at the front of the head and (wiped) until his hands reached the back of the head, then he brought them back to where he started. 
Abu Dawud (124) narrated that Mu`awiyah (may Allah be pleased with him) did Wudu for the people as he had seen the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) doing Wudu. When he reached his head, he scooped up some water into his left hand and put his hands onto the middle of his head until the water dripped down or almost dripped down. Then he wiped it from front to back, and from back to front. (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud) 
Abu Dawud (122) narrated that Al-Miqdam ibn Ma’di Yakrib (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I saw the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) doing Wudu. When he reached the wiping of his head, he put his hands at the front of his head (and wiped) until he reached the back, then he brought them back to the place where he had started. (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud) 
This way of wiping the head suits one whose hair is short and will not be messed up by bringing the hands back to the front of the head. 

Wiping the whole head , but in the direction of the hair only, so that the hair is not changed or messed up. 

This way of wiping suits one whose hair is long – man or woman – lest the hair be messed up by bringing back the hands. 
Ahmad (26484) and Abu Dawud (128) narrated from Ar-Rubayyi` bint Mu`awwidh ibn `Afra’ (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did Wudu in her house, and he wiped his entire head from the top of the head to the end of the hair, but he did not move the hair out of place. (Classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud)  
Al-`Iraqi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “What is meant is that he used to start wiping at the top of his head and end at the bottom, doing that on all sides of his head.” 
Ibn Raslan (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This method is only for one who has long hair, because if he moves his hands back again to make the water reach the roots of his hair, he will mess up his hair. 
It was narrated from Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) that he was asked how a woman or one who has long hair like a woman should wipe their heads ? He said: If he wishes he may wipe it in the manner narrated from Ar-Rubayyi`, then he said, Like this: And he placed his hand at the top of his head and brought it down to the front, then he lifted it up and placed it where he had started (at the top of his head) and brought it down to the back. 
It may be understood that what is meant by Qarn (translated above as “the top of the head”) is the front of the head, i.e., the wiping starts at the front of the head covering all sides of it to the back of the head, i.e., he wipes his head once from front to back, and he does not bring his hands back again, to avoid messing up the hair. Ar-Rubayyi` (may Allah be pleased with her) said: Do not mess up the hair. (See ‘Awn Al-Ma`bud Sharh Sunan Abi Dawud, Nayl Al-Awtar (1/189) and Al-Mughni (1/178) 
The point is that this way is to be used by one who fears that his hair will get messed up, so he wipes his hair in the direction that the hair is growing, so that his hair will not get messed up.

Please note that I wear niqaab but because of my studies, where I have to write and use equipment like computers etc, I cannot always cover my hands because that hinders me, and the place is not free of men.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for a woman – especially if she says that she wears niqaab – to mix with non-mahram men and to sit with them, whether that is in school or at work. We have stated the ruling on mixing and its evil consequences in our answers to questions no. 1200, 20784 and 12837. 
The evil consequences of mixing include men and women looking at one another, which is haraam. Allaah has commanded the believing men and women to lower their gaze and avoid looking at that which is not permissible for them. 
It is not permissible for non-mahrams to see anything of her, or for her to be careless about how she dresses so that anything appears of her that it is not permissible for her to show.
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: 
The truth of the matter is that Allaah has made two types of adornment: visible and invisible. It is permissible for a woman to show her visible, outward adornment to people other than her husband and mahrams. Before the verse of hijab was revealed the women used to go out without a jilbaab and the men could see their faces and hands. When it was permissible for a woman to show her face and hands, it was permissible to look at them because it was permissible for a woman to show them. Then when Allaah revealed the verse of hijab and said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks (veils) all over their bodies (i.e. screen themselves completely except the eyes or one eye to see the way). That will be better, that they should be known (as free respectable women) so as not to be annoyed. And Allaah is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful”
[al-Ahzaab 33:59]
then the women began to observe hijab in front of men. 
The jilaab is a wrapper, which Ibn Mas’ood and others called the rida’ (cloak), and which the common folk [i.e. at the time of Ibn Taymiyah] call the izaar. It is a large izaar with which a woman covers her head and the rest of her body. Moreover it may be said that when they were commanded to wear the jilbaab lest they be recognized, this refers to covering the face, or covering the face with a niqaab (face veil), hence it may be understood that the face and hands are part of the beautify which women are commanded not to show to non-mahrams. So there is nothing left that it is permissible for non-mahrams to see except the outer garments. 
So the face, hands and feet are not to be shown to non-mahrams according to the more sound of the two scholarly opinions, unlike what used to happen before the abrogation, indeed nothing is to be seen but the garment. 
Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 22/110-114.

But recently I have started to experience waswaas (whispers from the Shaytaan) telling me that which I do is contaminated with elements of showing off, and Allah will never accept it. Sometimes I find myself hesitating to do some good things for fear of showing off.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Just as the Shaytaan comes to the Muslim to make him admire his actions and show off to people, sometimes too he uses the opposite trick and makes a person think that he is showing off, so that he will not do it. 
In order to avoid both problems, we have to make sure that our intention is sound and make it sincerely and purely for the sake of Allah, and not worry after that about anything that the Shaytaan may come up with. 
Ibn Muflih al-Hanbali said – in a chapter on “We should not give up prescribed actions for fear of showing off”: One of the things that may happen to a person is that when he wants to do an act of worship, it occurs to him that he should not do it for fear of showing off. 
What he should do is not to pay attention to that. He can do that which Allah has commanded him to do or encouraged him to do, and seek the help of Allah, and trust in Him that he will do it in the manner prescribed in Islam. 
Shaykh Muhiy al-Deen al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: You should not give up remembering Allah verbally and in your heart because you think you may be showing off, rather you should remember Him in both ways, seeking thereby the Face of Allah. And he quoted al-Fudayl ibn ‘Iyaad (may Allah have mercy on him) as saying: Giving up a good deed for the sake of people is also showing off, and doing it for the sake of people is shirk. He said: If a person opens the door to noticing people and worrying about what they think then most of the doors to goodness will be closed to him.  
Abu’l-Faraj ibn al-Jawzi said: With regard to not doing good deeds for fear of showing off, if the motive for doing that deed is other than religious, then he should not do it because it is a sin. But if the motive for that is religious and it is sincerely for the sake of Allah, then he should not refrain from doing it, because the motive is religious. Similarly if he does not do a good deed for fear that it will be said that he is a show-off, then he should ignore that because it is one of the tricks of the Shaytaan. 
Ibraaheem al-Nakha’i said: If the Shaytaan comes to you when you are praying and says, “you are showing off,” then you should make it even longer. With regard to the reports narrated from one of the salaf, that he stopped worshipping for fear of showing off, this is to be understood as meaning that they felt that they were showing off, so they stopped it. And that is indeed the case. For example, al-A’mash said: I was with Ibraaheem al-Nakha’i when he was reading Qur’aan, and a man asked for permission to enter, so he covered the Mus-haf. He said: So that he will not think that I read it all the time. So if you should not stop doing an act of worship for fear of showing off, it is more appropriate that you should not stop it for fear of self admiration that may occur later on. 
Al-Adaab al-Shara’iyyah, 1/266-267 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: 
When a person thinks of doing a good deed, the Shaytaan comes and whispers to him: “You want to do that to show off and have a good reputation,” so he backs off from doing that good deed. How can we avoid this? 
He replied: 
That can be avoided by seeking refuge with Allah from the accursed Shaytaan, and going ahead with the good deed. You should not pay attention to this waswaas (whisper from the Shaytaan) that puts you off doing good. If you turn away from this and seek refuge with Allah from the accursed Shaytaan, the problem will disappear, by Allah’s leave.

How should I interact with the female students and teachers?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Studying in mixed schools, institutes and universities is not permitted. The evils that exist in these institutions because of that mixing are no secret, let alone the fact that people do not learn much, if anything, in these institutions. Wise people even in kaafir countries have called for segregation between the sexes in educational institutions because of the moral damage they have noticed and the weakening of educational standards. Trustworthy scholars have issued fatwas stating that this kind of education is not permissible. 
The scholars of the Standing Committee said: 
It is haraam for male and female students and teachers to mix in educational institutions, because of the fitnah and provocation of desires and immoral conduct that results from that. The gravity of the sin is compounded if the female teachers and students uncover any part of their ‘awrahs or wear see-through or tight clothing, or if the students or teachers flirt or joke together, which may lead to transgression of limits and violation of honour.

Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: 
Is it permissible for a man to study in a mixed university where men and women mix in one classroom, knowing that the student has a role to play in calling people to Allaah? 
He replied: 
What I think is that it is not permissible for anyone, man or woman, to study in a mixed school, because of the grave danger that it poses to his chastity, integrity and morals. No matter how great a person’s integrity, morals and innocence, if a woman is sitting beside him on the seat – especially if she is beautiful and unveiled – he can hardly avoid fitnah and evil. Everything that leads to fitnah and evil is also haraam and is not permitted. We ask Allaah to keep our Muslim brothers safe from such things which will only bring evil, fitnah and corruption to their youth. If there is no other university apart from this one, he should go and study in another city or country where this mixing does not happen. I do not think that this is permissible but others may have a different opinion.

This is easy for those who do not have the problem of mixed schools in their country or who have access to colleges and universities that are not mixed, so they have no need to study in mixed colleges. But there remains the question of those who are faced with the problem of mixed schools in their countries. What should they do, especially if that will affect their chances of earning a living or of getting married in the future, since if they do not study in these colleges they will not be able to find a job or get married. 
In this case, there is no option, and the need is great, and when the need is great, the matter may come under the heading of necessity. This necessity may be taken into consideration, provided that the following conditions are met: 
1-That there be no other place where he can study, even if it is in another country
2-That he cannot obtain this certificate by means of distance learning or studying via the internet, for example
3-That he goes to study in these mixed places seeking the help of Allaah to confront fitnah.
He should take care to lower his gaze as much as he can and not touch or shake hands with non-mahram women or be alone with them, and he should not sit right next to them.
He should advise the girls to sit away from the boys and adhere to other Islamic guidelines as well.
4-If he notices himself slipping towards haraam things and being tempted by those of the opposite sex who are with him, then the soundness of his religious commitment is more important than any worldly aims, so he has to leave the place immediately and Allaah will make him independent of means by His bounty. And Allaah is the One Whose help we seek.

Is she sinning if she makes a mistake about when she becomes pure, such as if she thinks that she became pure, then after doing ghusl and praying she finds traces of it or, conversely, if she waits and misses some prayers because she thinks that she has not yet become pure, because it is difficult for her to know when she becomes pure without that white discharge? May Allah reward you with good.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Menstruation differs from one woman to another, and the signs that one woman’s period has ended may vary from time to time. 
For most women the sign that the period has ended is the emission of the white discharge. For some women the sign is that the bleeding stops. 
No matter what the sign is for a woman, it is not permissible for her to hasten until the sign appears, because it is not permissible for her to pray or fast when she is menstruating, until she becomes pure. 
The women used to send containers to ‘Aa’ishah in which were the cotton pads with traces of yellow on them. She would say: “Do not hasten until you see the white discharge.” 
This was narrated by al-Bukhaari in a mu’allaq report in Kitaab al-Hayd, Baab iqbaal al-maheed wa idbaarihi (Book of Menses, Chapter on the start and end of the menstrual flow); and by Maalik, 130   
If a woman makes a mistake about the time of the end of her period, based on her own reasoning, then she is not sinning, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And there is no sin on you concerning that in which you made a mistake, except in regard to what your hearts deliberately intend” [al-Ahzaab 33:5]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has forgiven my ummah for mistakes, what they forget and what they are forced to do. “ Narrated by Ibn Maajah, 2053; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah. 
But if she thinks that she has become pure and she prays and fasts, then she realizes that she is still menstruating, then she has to stop praying and fasting until she becomes pure, and she should make up the obligatory fasts that she observed during that time, because it is now apparent that they were not valid, because the fast of a menstruating women is not valid. 
If she stops praying because she thinks that she has not yet become pure, then she finds out that she was pure, then she has to make up those prayers. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked (11/280) about a woman who saw a brownish discharge before her usual period, so she stopped praying, then the blood came at the usual time. What is the ruling on that? 
He replied: Umm ‘Atiyyah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “We used to not regard the yellowish and brownish discharge after the tuhr (white discharge indicating that the period is over) as being of any significance.” Based on this, this brownish discharge that comes before the period does not seem to me to be part of the period, especially since it came before the usual time of menstruation and there were no other signs of menstruation such as cramps, backache, etc. So it is better for her to make up the prayers that she missed during this time. 
He was also asked (11/275) about a woman who bled for nine days, so she did not pray, thinking that this was her period. Then a few days later her real period came – what should she do: should she make up the prayers of the days she missed or what?
He replied:  it is better for her to make up the prayers that she missed during the first days, but if she does not do that there is no sin on her, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not command the woman who was suffering from severe istihaadah (non-menstrual vaginal bleeding) and had stopped praying because of that, to do so. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told her to regard six or seven days as her period and to pray during the rest of the month; he did not tell her to repeat the prayers she had missed, even though making up the prayers she had missed would have been good, because she may have been negligent in not asking before, but even though she did not repeat them there was no sin on her.

“And those who, when they have committed fahishah (illegal sexual intercourse) or wronged themselves with evil, remember Allah and ask forgiveness for their sins; — and none can forgive sins but Allah — and do not persist in what (wrong) they have done, while they know.
For such, the reward is forgiveness from their Lord, and Gardens with rivers flowing underneath (Paradise), wherein they shall abide forever. How excellent is this reward for the doers (who do righteous deeds according to Allah’s orders).”
[3:135-136] 
Ibn Katheer said: 
The words “and do not persist in what (wrong) they have done” mean: they repent from their sins and quickly turn to Allah, and they do not persist in their sin, rather they give it up, and if they do it again they repent to Him. Tafseer Ibn Katheer. 
It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “A person committed a sin and said: ‘My Lord, I have sinned; forgive me.’ His Lord said: ‘Is My slave acknowledging that he has a Lord Who forgives sins and punishes for them? I have forgiven My slave.’ Then as much time passed as Allah willed, then he committed a sin and said, ‘My Lord, I have sinned; forgive me.’ His Lord said: ‘Is My slave acknowledging that he has a Lord Who forgives sins and punishes for them?  I have forgiven My slave.’ Then as much time passed as Allah willed, then he committed a sin and said, ‘My Lord, I have sinned; forgive me.’ His Lord said: ‘Is My slave acknowledging that he has a Lord Who forgives sins and punishes for them? I have forgiven My slave,’ – three times…” [al-Bukhari, Muslim]. 
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) included this hadeeth (narration) under the heading: “Acceptance of repentance from sins even if the sins and repentance happen repeatedly.” 
He said in his Sharh (commentary): 
We have already discussed this issue at the beginning of the Book of Repentance. These hadeeths (narrations) clearly point to that, and even if the sin is repeated a hundred times or a thousand times or more, and he repents each time, his repentance will be accepted and his sin will be erased. And if he repents once from them all, his repentance will be valid. 
Sharh Muslim. 
Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali said: 
‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez said: O people, whoever commits a sin, let him seek the forgiveness of Allah and repent, and if he repeats it, let him seek the forgiveness of Allah and repent, and if he repeats it, let him seek the forgiveness of Allah and repent, for it is like chains around the neck of man, and doom lies in persisting in it.  
What this means is that a person will inevitably commit the sins that it is decreed he will commit, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The son of Adam’s share of zina (fornication/adultery) is decreed for him, and he will inevitably come to that…” But Allah has given him a way out from the sins that he falls into and He erases them by means of repentance and seeking forgiveness. If he does this then he will escape from the evil of sin, but if he persists in his sin he will be doomed. 
Jami’ al-‘Uloom wal-Hikam. 
Although Allah hates sin and warns of punishment for it, He does not want His slaves to despair of His mercy. He likes the sinner to seek His forgiveness and repent to Him, but the shaytan (devil) likes it when despair fills a person’s heart and prevents him from repenting and turning to Allah. 
It was said to al-Hasan al-Basri: Would not any one of us feel ashamed before his Lord to seek forgiveness from his sin then go back to it, then seek forgiveness then go back to it? He said: The shaytan would like you to feel that way; never give up seeking forgiveness.

45889,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45889,"He vowed to give charity every time he committed a sin, then he committed sin but did not give charity","I had a problem with a sin, and one day after doing it I regretted it deeply and began to curse myself. Then I raised my finger and said, literally, “I vow that if I do this habit again, I will give five hundred riyals in charity, and if I do it another time I will give this amount in charity again,” i.e., each time I did it I would give five hundred riyals in charity. But I did it again, many times.

 My question is: What should I do in this case, knowing that I have not even given a single riyal in charity yet, and I do not know how many times I did it, but it has been a long time? Please advise me, may Allaah reward you with good..",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    Making vows so that one will not commit sin is something that 
    was done by some of the salaf, in order to punish themselves and train 
    themselves not to commit sin, but that was with regard to things that thy 
    were able to do. 

    Harmalah said: I heard Abu Wahb say: I vowed that every time 
    I backbit about a person I would fast for a day and that wore me out, 
    because I used to backbite and fast. So I intended that every time I backbit 
    about a person I would give a dirham in charity instead, and because of my 
    love of money I gave up backbiting. 

    Al-Dhahabi said: This, by Allaah, is how the scholars were. 
    This is one of the fruits of beneficial knowledge. 

    Siyar A’laam al-Nubala’, 9/228 

    It is better for a Muslim to refrain from committing sin 
    without making vows or oaths, so that he will not expose himself to breaking 
    that oath or not fulfilling that vow. 

    Secondly: 

    If the one who makes a vow intends to prevent himself from 
    doing a particular deed, then either he will break that vow or he will not. 
    If he does not break it then he does not have to do anything. If he does 
    break it then he is given the choice of two things: either to fulfil the vow 
    or to offer kafaarat yameen (expiation for breaking a vow).   

    Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni (13/461): 

    If he makes a vow to prevent himself or someone else from 
    doing something, or to encourage him to do something, such as saying, ‘If I 
    speak to Zayd, then I am bound to perform Hajj, or give my wealth in 
    charity, or fast for a year,” this is a vow and the ruling is that he has 
    the choice between fulfilling what he swore to do, in which case he does not 
    have to do anything else, or breaking his vow. So he has the choice between 
    doing what he vowed to do or offering kafaarat yameen. This is called a vow 
    of desperation and anger, and he does not have to fulfil it. This is the 
    view of ‘Umar, Ibn ‘Abbaas, Ibn ‘Umar, ‘Aa’ishah, Hafsah and Zaynab bint Abi 
    Salamah. It is also the view of al-Shaafa’i. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was asked: 

    I am a young man who was negligent then Allaah guided me, but 
    I still commit some sins. I have tried to repent from them many times but I 
    could not. I said to myself that I should vow that if I repeated this sin, I 
    would fast for two consecutive months. But the Shaytaan tempted me and I 
    said that the vow in this case is like a yameen (oath) for which kafaarah 
    (expiation) may be offered. Then I committed that sin again. What should I 
    do, may Allaah reward you with good? Is it permissible for me to feed sixty 
    poor persons, because that is easier for me than fasting? Please note that 
    Allaah has blessed me by helping me to repent from this sin now. 

    He replied: 

    Firstly: A Muslim should be determined, resolved and strong 
    in resisting haraam things without swearing oaths or making vows, and he 
    should do what he is obliged to do without swearing oaths or making vows. 
    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“They swear by Allaah 
    their strongest oaths, that if only you would order them, they would leave 
    (their homes for fighting in Allaah’s Cause). Say: Swear you not; (this) 
    obedience (of yours) is known (to be false). Verily, Allaah knows well what 
    you do”

    [al-Noor 24:53]

    But some people may be incapable of controlling themselves so 
    they resort to vows and oaths to make themselves do what they are obliged 
    to, or to refrain from doing haram things. The scholars (may Allaah have 
    mercy on them) mentioned that the vow which is intended to help one to 
    refrain from something haraam or do something obligatory comes under the 
    ruling of a yameen (oath). Hence the brother who asked this question has to 
    offer kafaarat yameen as an expiation for this oath, by feeding ten poor 
    persons, giving each one of them a mudd (or two handfuls) of rice or wheat, 
    or clothing ten poor persons, or freeing a slave. He has the choice of doing 
    one of these three things. If he cannot do any of them, then he has to fast 
    for three consecutive days, because Allaah says in Soorat al-Maa'idah 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allaah will not punish 
    you for what is unintentional in your oaths, but He will punish you for your 
    deliberate oaths; for its expiation (a deliberate oath) feed ten Masaakeen 
    (poor persons), on a scale of the average of that with which you feed your 
    own families, or clothe them or manumit a slave. But whosoever cannot afford 
    (that), then he should fast for three days”

    [al-Maa’idah 5:89]

    With regard to feeding the poor, it is permissible to make 
    food, lunch or dinner, and invite ten poor people to come and eat.

    In the answer to question no
    40263 we have 
    already stated that it is haraam to participate in pyramid-selling schemes 
    like the “Business” company, even if these companies sell a real product 
    that has some value, because the aim is not to sell that product, rather the 
    aim is marketing, and pyramid marketing is based on ambiguity and consuming 
    people’s wealth unlawfully. 

    Shaykh Saami ibn Ibraaheem al-Suwaylim said: 

    The essential idea behind pyramid marketing is simple and may 
    be summed up as follows: A person buys the company’s products in return for 
    the opportunity to convince others to do what he did (i.e., to buy the 
    company’s products too), in return for which he takes commission. Then each 
    of these people who joined the scheme convinces yet others to join too, and 
    the first one gets additional commission, and so on. 

    He also said concerning the “Tasweeq net” (marketing net) 
    company – which is a company that sells real products –  

    This system mentioned in the question is a pyramid marketing 
    scheme, no matter what form it takes, in which the person who joins it 
    convinces others to buy so that they can also join the marketing scheme. So 
    long as the commission is greater than the value of the product, the primary 
    goal behind buying is the commission and the product is secondary. Based on 
    that, this is not allowed according to sharee’ah because it involves 
    ambiguity and consuming people’s wealth unlawfully, since the one who joins 
    the scheme does not know whether he will succeed in convincing others to 
    join or not. If he succeeds then he will profit at their expense from their 
    subscriptions, otherwise he will lose the money that he paid to join the 
    scheme, and those who joined through him will be subject to the same risks. 
    Each level in the pyramid will lose, unless there is a level beneath them 
    which can bear the brunt of the loss, and so on.
