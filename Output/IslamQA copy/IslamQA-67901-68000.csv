67911,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/67911,The extent to which delaying prayer may be forgiven in the case of women,"Is a Muslim woman who prays at home considered to be sinning if she delays praying Zuhr until half an hour or a quarter of an hour before the adhaan of ‘Asr, or she prays ‘Asr half an hour or a quarter of an hour before the adhaan of Maghrib, or if she prays ‘Isha’ half an hour before the adhaan of Fajr? If the answer is that this is not permissible, what is the extent to which delaying the prayer may be allowed without incurring any sin?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to delay prayers beyond the time when they are due, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, As‑Salaah (the prayer) is enjoined on the believers at fixed hours” [al-Nisa’ 4:103] 
“Then, there has succeeded them a posterity who have given up As‑Salaah (the prayers) [i.e. made their Salaah (prayers) to be lost, either by not offering them or by not offering them perfectly or by not offering them in their proper fixed times] and have followed lusts. So they will be thrown in Hell” [Maryam 19:59]
Islam has told us the times of the prayers, as described in the hadeeth which was narrated by Muslim (217) from ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) from the Prophet who said: “The time of Zuhr is so long as the time for ‘Asr has not begun, and the time for ‘Asr is so long as the sun has not begun to turn yellow, and the time for Maghrib is so long as the afterglow has not faded, and the time for ‘Isha’ is until midnight, and the time for Fajr is so long as the sun has not yet risen.” 
In the answer to question no. 9940 we have explained the times of the five daily prayers in detail. 
It is sufficient here to mention the end of the time for each prayer. 
The end of the time for Zuhr is when the time for ‘Asr begins. 
The end of the time for ‘Asr is when the sun starts to turn yellow; the time is extended in cases of necessity, such as when a person is sick, etc., to when the sun sets. 
The end of the time for Maghrib is when the red afterglow disappears from the sky, which is the beginning of the time for ‘Isha’. 
The end of the time for ‘Isha’ is midnight (halfway through the night), and it does not last until the time when dawn begins. 
The end of the time for Fajr is when the sun rises. 
It is permissible to offer the prayer at any point within the time for that prayer, whether at the beginning, in the middle or at the end. It is not permissible to delay any of these prayers until after its time is over without a valid excuse such as sleeping or forgetting. 
Based on that, praying Zuhr half an hour or a quarter of an hour before ‘Asr is valid, and there is no sin on you in that. 
With regard to ‘Asr, you must pray it before the sun turns yellow, and the timing of that varies from one season to another. It seems that quarter of an hour before Maghrib the sun will have turned yellow, so the time for ‘Asr will be over. 
It is not permissible for you to delay ‘Isha’ until half an hour before Fajr, because the time for ‘Isha’ is up to midnight, as it says in the hadeeth. If you want to work out when midnight is, then calculate the time from sunset until dawn, and half way between the two is the end of the time for ‘Isha’ (this is midnight). If the sun sets at five o’clock and the adhan for Fajr is given at five o’clock, then midnight (or half way through the night) is eleven o’clock at night. 
It is better to hasten to perform the prayers when the time for them begins, because of the hadeeth narrated by al-Bukhaari (496) and Muslim (122) from ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ood (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: I asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “Which deed is most beloved to Allah?” He said: “Prayer offered on time.” He said, “Then what?” He said, “Honouring one’s parents.” He said: “Then what?” He said, “Jihad for the sake of Allah.” 
And Allah knows best.",Islam Q&A
67921,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/67921,Is the son of her husband’s daughter regarded as a mahram for her?,Is it permissible for a woman who is over sixty to not wear hijab in front of the son of her husband’s daughter who is fifteen years old? He is like a grandson to her. Is it permissible for her to shake hands with him or kiss him? Her husband who is the grandfather of this boy has passed away.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: The son who is asked about here is regarded as a 
    mahram for this woman, so she may shake hands with him and uncover in front 
    of him as she uncovers in front of her mahrams, and it makes no deference 
    that his grandfather is deceased. 

    The way in which he is her mahram is that she is the wife of 
    his grandfather on his mother’s side. Permanently forbidden in marriage for 
    a man are his father’s and his grandfather’s wife, no matter how far the 
    line of ascent reaches, whether the grandfather is on his father’s side or 
    his mother’s, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And marry not women whom your fathers married, except 
    what has already passed; indeed it was shameful and most hateful, and an 
    evil way”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:22]
It says in Zaad 
    al-Mustaqni’: The marriage contract makes the wife of the father and 
    every grandfather a mahram. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in 
    his Sharh: The marriage contract is valid, and makes forbidden in 
    marriage the wife of his father or grandfather, no matter how far the line 
    of ascent reaches. Every woman who has been married by his father, even if 
    he divorced her, is permanently forbidden in marriage to him, and the same 
    applies to every woman who was married by his grandfather, whether on his 
    father’s side or his mother’s. The evidence for that is the verse in which 
    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And marry not women whom your fathers married, except 
    what has already passed; indeed it was shameful and most hateful, and an 
    evil way”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:22]
If he marries her, that 
    is worse than zina, because Allaah says concerning zina (interpretation of 
    the meaning): 

    “And come not near to unlawful sex. Verily, it is a 
    Faahishah (i.e. anything that transgresses its limits: a great sin, and an 
    evil way (that leads one to hell unless Allaah Forgives him)”

    [al-Isra’ 17:32]

    But concerning this, Allaah says: “indeed it was shameful 
    and most hateful, and an evil way”. Marrying mahrams – Allaah forbid – 
    is worse than zina. Hence many of the scholars were of the view that the one 
    who commits zina with one of his mahrams, even if he is not married, is to 
    be killed. There is a hadeeth concerning that in al-Sunan. So the 
    wife of one's father or grandfather, not matter how far the line of ascent 
    reaches, is forbidden in marriage, whether on the father’s side or the 
    mother’s, and Allaah has not stipulated that the marriage should be 
    consummated etc, rather this ruling comes into effect by virtue of a valid 
    marriage contract. End quote from al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 5/198 

    This is a matter concerning which there is no difference of 
    opinion among the scholars. Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    said, discussing the fact that a father’s wife is a mahram: It is the same 
    whether she is the wife of his father, or the wife of his paternal 
    grandfather, or the wife of his maternal grandfather, whether near or far.  
    There is no dispute concerning that among the scholars as far as we know, 
    praise be to Allaah. End quote from al-Mughni, 9/518, 524 

    Secondly: 

    With regard to kissing, she may kiss him so long as there is 
    no risk of fitnah, and it is better to kiss him on the forehead or head. 
Imam Ahmad (may Allaah 
    have mercy on him) was asked about a kissing a mahram man. He said: If he 
    has come from a journey and there is no fear (of fitnah). But it should 
    never be on the lips, only on the forehead or head. 

    Al-Adaab al-Shar’iyyah by Ibn 
    Muflih, 2/266 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was 
    asked about kissing mahrams. He said: 

    If kissing mahrams is done with desire or one fears that 
    desire may be provoked, it is haraam without a doubt. If there is no fear of 
    fitnah then there is nothing wrong with kissing on the head or forehead. As 
    for kissing on the cheek or lips, that should be avoided, except in the case 
    of a father and daughter or mother and son, for example. It is more lenient 
    in this case because Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) entered upon 
    ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) when she was sick and kissed her 
    on the cheek, and said, “How are you, O my daughter?” End quote, from 
    Fataawa ‘Ulama’ al-Balad al-Haraam, p. 691.

67925,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/67925,She loves Islamic nasheeds and they take up a lot of her time,"I used to be one of those who listen to songs all the time, to such an extent that I memorized them, but praise be to Allaah, for nine years I have not listened to them. But there is another problem; I started to love Islamic nasheeds very much and they take up a considerable amount of my time. Is there any sin in that?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    Songs which are accompanied by musical instruments or which 
    contain words of love or provoke desire, are undoubtedly haraam, because of 
    a great deal of evidence to that effect, which you will find in the answers 
    to questions no. 5000 and 
    20406. 

    So we praise Allaah for having enabled you to give up 
    listening to songs and turned your heart away from them. 

    Secondly: 

    There is nothing wrong with listening to Islamic nasheeds 
    which contain words of wisdom, exhortation, encouragement to do good, and 
    promotion of noble attitudes, so long as there are no musical instruments 
    and the voices do not provoke fitnah or incite one to do haraam deeds, and 
    so long as one does not listen to them a great deal. 

    The Standing Committee issued a detailed fatwa concerning the 
    ruling on Islamic nasheeds, which states the following: 

    You have spoken the truth concerning the prohibition on songs 
    as they exist nowadays, because they include immoral and indecent words, and 
    they include things in which there is nothing good. Indeed, they are full of 
    idle talk and provocation of desire, sexual urges and promiscuity, and 
    softening of the voice in such a way that it tempts the listener to evil. 
    May Allaah help us and you to do that which pleases Him. 

    It is permissible, as an alternative to these songs, for you 
    to listen to Islamic nasheeds which include wisdom, exhortation and words 
    that promote enthusiasm and protective jealousy for Islam, and stir up 
    Islamic feelings, and put one off evil and the things that lead to it, to 
    motivate the one who “sings” the nasheeds and the one who listens to them to 
    obey Allaah and deter them from sin and transgressing the sacred limits of 
    Allaah, and encourage them to live life within the framework of sharee’ah 
    and to strive in jihad for His sake. But he should not regard that as a 
    “wird” that he must adhere to, or a habit in which he engages on a continual 
    basis, rather it should be something that he listens to from time to time on 
    appropriate occasions when there is a need for it, such as at weddings, when 
    travelling for jihad, and so on, or when he is feeling listless and needs 
    something to revive his spirits and encourage him to do good, or when he 
    feels inclined towards evil so he listens to it to deter himself from it. 

    Even better than that is committing oneself to reasing a 
    portion of Qur’aan on a daily basis, or a wird of dhikrs that are narrated 
    from the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). That is 
    purer for his soul and is more effective in bringing comfort to the heart. 
    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Allaah has sent down the Best Statement, a Book (this 
    Qur’aan), its parts resembling each other (in goodness and truth) (and) 
    oft‑repeated. The skins of those who fear their Lord shiver from it (when 
    they recite it or hear it). Then their skin and their heart soften to the 
    remembrance of Allaah. That is the Guidance of Allaah. He guides therewith 
    whom He wills; and whomever Allaah sends astray, for him there is no guide”

    [al-Zumar 39:23]

    “Those who believed (in the Oneness of Allaah — Islamic 
    Monotheism), and whose hearts find rest in the remembrance of Allaah verily, 
    in the remembrance of Allaah do hearts find rest.

    29. Those who believed (in the Oneness of Allaah — Islamic 
    Monotheism), and work righteousness, Tûbâ (all kinds of happiness or name of 
    a tree in Paradise) is for them and a beautiful place of (final) return”

    [al-Ra’d 13:28, 29]

    The way of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) was 
    to pay particular attention to the Qur’aan and Sunnah, memorizing it, 
    studying it and acting upon it. Along with that they also had nasheeds and 
    chants which they would recite, such as when digging the ditch and building 
    mosques, and when travelling for jihad, and on other such occasions, without 
    making that their habit or focusing all their attention on it; it was simply 
    something with which they would relax occasionally or stir their emotions.  
     

    With regard to the tabl drum and other musical instruments, 
    it is not permissible to use them with these nasheeds, because the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his companions (may 
    Allaah be pleased with them) did not do that. 

    Allaah is the Guide to the Straight Path. May Allaah send 
    blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon his family and 
    companions. End quote from Fataawa Islamiyyah, 4/532 

    Thirdly: 
You should remember 
    Allaah a great deal (dhikr) and read Qur’aan; set yourself a daily wird to 
    memorize and review. Also keep yourself busy listening to some lessons and 
    lectures, because this is the best means of reducing the amount of nasheed 
    you listen to, and making use of your time with something that is beneficial 
    and useful. 

    It is very unfortunate that the one who listens to nasheed a 
    great deal finds it difficult to read Qur’aan or even to listen to it; this 
    is something harmful which should not be taken lightly. Even if the harm is 
    only causing him to miss out on a great deal of reward, that is should be 
    sufficient deterrent for the people of faith from becoming attached to 
    nasheeds and always listening to them. 

    It is well known that if a believer spends an hour reading 
    Qur’aan, thousands of hasanaat will be recorded for him, because the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever reads one 
    letter of the Book of Allaah will have one hasanah for that, and a hasanah 
    brings a tenfold reward. I do not say that alif-laam-meem is a letter, 
    rather alif is a letter, laam is a letter, meem is a letter.” Narrated by 
    al-Tirmidhi, 2910; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
One hour is sufficient 
    to read twenty pages of Qur’aan, in which there are no less than nine 
    thousand letters. 

    How can a person let listening to nasheeds distract him from 
    listening to the Book of Allaah and reciting it? 

    Strive to reduce the amount of time you spend listening to 
    these nasheeds as much as you can, so that you only listen to them during 
    weddings, Eid and so on, and make the best use of your time so that you may 
    rise in status. Soon, by Allaah’s leave, you will find delight in reading 
    Qur’aan, and the joy of worship and the sweetness of faith, with the words 
    of the Most Merciful. 

    We ask Allaah to help us and you to do that which He loves 
    and which pleases Him.

Or is it also permissible for a person who is able to stand, but it is possible that it may lead to harm? What is the definition of the inability that makes it permissible to sit during the prayer and not stand, without that incurring sin or punishment?","It is not permissible for you to pray sitting down in obligatory prayers unless you are unable to stand, or standing is very difficult for you, or you are sick and there is the fear that your sickness may become worse if you pray standing up. It is permissible to pray sitting down in optional prayers, even without an excuse, but the reward of the one who sits in that case is half the reward of one who stands","Can you pray sitting down in obligatory prayer?


Can you pray sitting down in Sunnah prayers?","Praise be to Allah.Can you pray sitting down in obligatory prayer?
Standing during prayer is an obligatory pillar which cannot be omitted. It is not permissible for anyone to pray sitting unless he is unable to stand, or standing is very difficult for him, or he is sick and there is the fear that his sickness may become worse if he prays standing up. 
That also includes a paralyzed person who is unable to stand at all, and an elderly person for whom it is difficult to stand, and a sick person who will be harmed by standing because it will either make his sickness worse or delay his recovery. 
The basic principle concerning that is the report narrated by Al-Bukhari (1050) from `Imran ibn Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: I had haemorrhoids, and I asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about praying. He said: “Pray standing; if you cannot, then sitting; and if you cannot, then lying on your side.” 
Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“If standing will make a sick person’s sickness worse, then he should pray sitting. The scholars unanimously agreed that a person who cannot stand may pray sitting. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to `Imran ibn Husayn: “Pray standing; if you cannot, then sitting; and if you cannot, then lying on your side.” 
It was also narrated by Al-Bukhari, Abu Dawud and An-Nasa’i (may Allah have mercy on them), who added: “If you cannot, then lying on your back, and Allah does not burden any soul beyond its scope.”
 Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) fell from a horse and was injured on his right side. We entered upon him to visit him and the time for prayer came. He prayed sitting and we prayed sitting behind him. (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim) 
If he is able to stand but he fears that his sickness will be made worse, or that his recovery may be delayed, or it is too hard for him to stand, then he may pray sitting down. Something similar was said by Malik and Is-haq (may Allah have mercy on them). Maymun ibn Mahran (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If he is unable to stand for any worldly purpose, then let him pray sitting. Something similar was narrated from Ahmad.
i.e., if he is able to stand for some worldly purpose then he must also pray standing and it is not permissible for him to pray sitting.  
Then Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: But Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “[He] has not laid upon you in religion any hardship” [Al-Hajj 22:78]. Obliging a person to stand in this case is hardship. And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sat when he had been injured on his right side, although it appears that he was not completely unable to stand, but because of the difficulty involved in standing, this requirement was waived for him, and is waived for others too… If a person is able to stand by leaning on a stick or on the wall, or leaning on someone who is next to him, then he should do that, because he is able to stand without it causing him harm, so he must do it, just as he should if he is able to do it without these things.”
An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“The scholars of the Ummah unanimously agreed that whoever is unable to stand in an obligatory prayer may pray sitting , and he does not have to repeat it. Our companions said: That does not detract from the reward that he would earn if he prayed standing, because he is excused. It is proven in Sahih Al-Bukhari that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If a person is sick or is travelling, there is written for him (the reward) for the deeds he used to do when he was healthy or not travelling.” Our companions said:  For a person to be allowed to pray sitting down , it is not a condition that he should be completely unable to stand, and it is not enough if he finds it a little difficult; rather what counts is evident hardship. If he fears that it will be extremely difficult or it will make his sickness worse , etc, or a person who is travelling by boat fears that he may drown or become dizzy, then he may pray sitting, and he does not have to repeat it.”(Al-Majmu`, 4/201) 
Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) explained the definition of the hardship which makes it permissible for a person not to stand in an obligatory prayer, and how to sit. He said: The definition of difficulty is that which takes away Khushu ` (proper focus and humility). Khushu` means that the heart is focused and at peace. If it is the case that standing will make a person severely anxious and have no peace of mind, and he is longing to get to the end of Al-Fatihah so that he can bow because he is finding it too hard to stand, then it is too difficult for him to pray standing, so he should pray sitting. 
The same applies to one who is afraid and cannot pray standing, such as if he is praying behind a wall, and there are enemies around watching out for him, and if he stands they will be able to see him from behind the wall, but if he sits he will be hidden from his enemies. In this case we say to him: Pray sitting. 
This is indicated by the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And if you fear (an enemy), perform prayer on foot or riding” [Al-Baqarah 2:239]
Allah has exempted the one who is afraid from bowing, prostrating and sitting, and the same applies to standing if he is afraid. 
But how should he sit? 
He should sit Mutarabbi`an on his buttocks, with each calf tucked up to the thigh. This is called tarabbu’, and in this posture the calf and thigh on the right and the left are all visible, whereas in the case of Iftirash the calf disappears beneath the thigh, but in tarabbu’ all four parts (thigh and calf on both sides) are visible. 
Is it obligatory to sit like this? 
No, it is Sunnah. If a person prays Muftarishan (in the posture called Iftirash) there is nothing wrong with it, and if he prays Muhtabiyan (sitting with one’s legs drawn up and wrapped in one's garment) there is nothing wrong with it, because of the general meaning of the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “If he cannot, then sitting.” He did not explain how he is to sit.  
If a person says, Is there any evidence to suggest that he should pray Mutarabbi`an? The answer is yes. `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: I saw the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) praying mutarabbi’an. And because that is usually more comfortable than Al-Iftirash. It is well known that standing needs a longer recitation than saying, “Rabb ighfir li warhamni (Lord forgive me and have mercy on me).” Hence it is better to sit mutarabbi’an. And there is another benefit, which is differentiating between sitting instead of standing, and sitting when one is supposed to sit; if we say that a person should sit Muftarishan during the time of standing, there would be no difference between the way of sitting when one is supposed to and the way of sitting when it is done instead of standing.  
If that is at the time of bowing, some of them say that it should be Muftarishan but the correct view is that it should be mutarabbi’an, because when bowing a person’s leg and thigh are upright, and he only bends his back. So we say that if a person is mutarabbi’an he should remain like that and bow in that posture. This is the correct view concerning this matter.” (Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti`, 4/461) 
Can you pray sitting down in Sunnah prayers?
With regard to optional prayers, it is permissible to sit during them with no excuse, according to scholarly consensus, but the reward of the one who sits in that case is half the reward of one who stands, because of the report narrated by Muslim from `Abdullah ibn `Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: I was told that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The prayer of a man who sits is half of the prayer of a man who stands.” I came to him and found him praying sitting. I put my hand on his head and he said, ‘What is the matter, O `Abdullah ibn `Amr?” I said, “I was told, O Messenger of Allah, that you said, ‘The prayer of a man who sits is half of the prayer of a man who stands,’ and you are praying sitting.” He said, “Yes, but I am not like one of you.” 
An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Muslim: What this means is that the prayer of one who sits brings half the reward of the prayer of one who stands, which means that it is valid but brings a lesser reward. This Hadith is to be understood as referring to an optional prayer offered sitting when one is able to stand. This brings half the reward of a prayer offered standing. But if a person offers an optional prayer sitting down because he is unable to stand, then the reward is not reduced, rather it will be the same as one who stands. With regard to obligatory prayers, if a person prays sitting down when he is able to stand, his prayer is not valid and he will not be rewarded, rather he is sinning. 
Our companions (the Shafi`is) said: If he believes that to be permissible, he is a disbeliever and is subject to the rulings on apostates, just like one who regards Zina (adultery/fornication), Riba and other prohibited things to be permissible.
 If a person offers an obligatory prayer sitting down because he is unable to stand, or lying down because he is unable to stand or sit, then his reward will be like that of one who stands, and it will not be reduced, according to the consensus of our companions. The Hadith about the reduction in reward is to be understood as applying to one who offers an optional prayer sitting when he is able to stand. This differentiation is our view and is the view of the majority concerning the meaning of this Hadith.  
And he said: With regard to the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “I am not like any one of you,” according to our companions it is one of the unique characteristics of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that his optional prayers offered sitting when he was able to stand were like his optional prayers offered standing, as an honour for him, as he was also singled out for other honours that are well known in the books of our companions and others. We have discussed them in the beginning of Tahdhib Al-Asma’ wal-Lughat. (Sharh Sahih Muslim, 6/14)

67940,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/67940,Should she ask for a divorce from her husband who does not pray regularly and does not give her her rights?,"A young man came to propose marriage to me who is of a lower educational status than me, and he only got his high-school diploma, whereas I am at university, so I refused. His mother claimed that he has a diploma in English, then after that I found out that he does not know any English at all. She said that he is employed with a salary of 4000 riyals, and that this salary would be enough because his grandfather would give him an apartment as a gift. The marriage went ahead, but after that I found out that he owes debts to the bank which is deducted from his salary, and he gives me only 100 riyals per month. Three months ago he left his job and has not found another job. We have not moved to the apartment that his grandfather gave him even though it is now one year and four months since we got married, because he cannot spend on me. Rather we are living with his family. In addition to that he is heedless with regard to prayer and he only prays when I ask him to. He also very fat which prevents me from finding any pleasure with him. He does not pay any attention to personal hygiene and I am put off by him.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Marriage is one of the signs and blessings of Allaah, in which both spouses find peace, companionship, love and compassion, as well as keeping themselves chaste and producing righteous children to populate the earth in accordance with the laws of Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And among His Signs is this, that He created for you wives from among yourselves, that you may find repose in them, and He has put between you affection and mercy. Verily, in that are indeed signs for a people who reflect”
[al-Room 30:21]
These are the purposes for which marriage has been prescribed. If these aims are not achieved, then divorce is a means that is permitted in Islam, in order for the spouses to move onto a new marriage in which they may attain the aims and purposes of marriage. 
What you have mentioned makes it permissible for you to ask for divorce. Al-Tirmidhi (1187) narrated that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Any woman who asks her husband for a divorce without a reason, the fragrance of Paradise will be forbidden to her.” This hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
The phrase “without a reason” means without any hardship that makes her ask for a separation. 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The wife should behave in a reasonable manner and listen to and obey her husband in that which is right and proper, and she should not ask for a divorce with no reason. If there is a reason, there is nothing wrong with that, such as if he is miserly and does not give her her rights, or he commits a great deal of sin, such as drinking and the like, or if he stays up at night a great deal and neglects her right to intimacy, and other such reasons. These are valid reasons (for divorce). End quote from Fataawa al-Talaaq, p. 264. 
Although the reasons that you mention make it permissible for you to ask for divorce, you should think long and hard about this matter before doing it, and pay attention to a number of things: 
1 – Hope that he will improve, especially if you move to your own apartment. If you encourage him to pray regularly, perhaps Allaah will grant him a good provision and he will try to please you and give up the things that are upsetting you. Then you would have the reward for being patient and treating him well, and for helping him to change himself. So check yourself and think about your husband. If you hope that he can change, then be patient and seek reward with Allaah, and remember that patience brings relief and success. How many women have put up with their husbands and their bad treatment, then Allaah has changed them and they have become among the best of husbands, who did not forget their wives’ patience and kindness. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Repel (the evil) with one which is better (i.e. Allaah orders the faithful believers to be patient at the time of anger, and to excuse those who treat them badly) then verily he, between whom and you there was enmity, (will become) as though he was a close friend.
35. But none is granted it (the above quality) except those who are patient — and none is granted it except the owner of the great portion (of happiness in the Hereafter, i.e., Paradise and of a high moral character) in this world”
[Fussilat 41:34, 35]
The woman can play a great role in reforming her husband and calling him to goodness and success, if she uses wisdom, kindness and good methods. First of all she should focus on religious matters, before physical and material issues. If his religious commitment improves, he will be helped and guided in all his affairs, by Allaah’s leave and grace. 
2 – You should think of what your own situation will be if divorce happens. This is something to which no attention is paid at times of anger or when one is put off by one's husband. Rather it needs deep thought. The wise woman may accept a hard life with a husband in whom there is both good and bad, and she may prefer that to being divorced, suffering from loneliness and anxiety and looking for a husband at a time when many women are single and it is difficult for virgins to get married, let alone divorced women.   
This varies from one woman to another. A divorced woman may still be sought for her religious commitment, beauty, wealth or lineage. 
3 – You should turn to Allaah a great deal and ask Him to guide you and ward off evil from you. Do not make a decision until you have prayed to your Lord for guidance (istikhaarah). 
For information on the istikhaarah prayer, please see question no. 11981 and 2217. 
We ask Allaah to help you to do that which is good and right and will lead to success.

67942,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/67942,Should two khutbahs be given on Eid or only one?,What is the correct view concerning the Eid khutbah – should it be one khutbah or two? What is the evidence for that?,,,"Praise be to Allah.The majority of scholars, of the four madhhabs and others, are of the view that two khutbahs should be given on Eid, and the imam should sit briefly between them, as is done in the Jumu’ah (Friday) khutbah. 
It says in al-Mudawwanah 1/231: Maalik said: In all khutbahs – the khutbah of the imam when praying for rain (istisqa’), the two Eids, the day of ‘Arafah and on Fridays – the imam should separate between the two khutbahs by sitting briefly. End quote. 
Al-Shaafa’i (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Umm (1/272): It was narrated that ‘Ubayd-Allaah ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Utbah said: The Sunnah on Eid is for the imam to deliver two khutbahs, sitting briefly in between. Al-Shaafa’i said: that applies to the prayers for rain, the khutbah given during the eclipse prayer, the khutbah of Hajj, and every khutbah given to a congregation. End quote. 
See Badaa’i’ al-Sanaa’i’, 1/276; al-Mughni, 2/121 
Al-Shawkaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, commenting on the report quoted above: The second hadeeth makes it more likely to be correct when we draw an analogy with Jumu’ah. ‘Ubayd-Allaah ibn ‘Abd-Allaah is a Taabi’i, as is well known, so his saying, “It is Sunnah” cannot be taken as evidence that it is the Sunnah of the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), as is stated in the usool. There is a marfoo’ hadeeth narrated by Ibn Maajah which speaks of sitting in between the two khutbahs of Eid, but its isnaad includes Isma’eel ibn Muslim, who is da’eef (weak). End quote from Nayl al-Awtaar, 3/323 
The hadeeth of Ibn Maajah (1279) was narrated from Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah, who said: The Messenger of Allaah SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came out on the day of Fitr or Adha and delivered a khutbah standing, then he sat for a while, then he stood up. This hadeeth was narrated by al-Albaani in Da’eef Ibn Maajah, where he said it is munkar. 
It says in ‘Awn al-Ma’bood (4/4): al-Nawawi said in al-Khulaasah: the report narrated from Ibn Mas’ood, according to which he said, The Sunnah is for two khutbahs to be delivered on Eid, in between which the imam sits briefly, is da’eef and its isnaad is not uninterrupted. There is no proven report about giving more than one khutbah, and the evidence is analogy with Jumu’ah. End quote. 
We may conclude from this the evidence which supports the idea of giving two khutbahs is as follows: 
1 – The hadeeth of Ibn Maajah and the report of Ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with him), both of which are da’eef, as stated above. 
2 – The report of ‘Ubayd-Allaah ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Utbah, who is a Taabi’i. 
3 –Analogy with Jumu’ah 
4 – Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah be pleased with him) mentioned a fourth thing that may be quoted as evidence. He (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The phrase ‘two khutbahs’ reflects the view of the fuqaha’ (may Allaah have mercy on them), that there should be two khutbahs on Eid, because that was mentioned in a hadeeth narrated by Ibn Maajah with his isnaad, which requires further examination. The apparent meaning is that two khutbahs should be given, but whoever examines the Sunnah in agreed-upon reports in al-Saheehayn and elsewhere will see that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) only gave one khutbah, but after he had finished the first khutbah, he went to the women and exhorted them. If we take this as the basic principle concerning it being prescribed to give two khutbahs, then it is possible, although it is unlikely, because he went to the women and addressed them because they could not hear the khutbah. This is possible. And it may be possible that they could hear his words, but he wanted to address them specifically, hence he reminded them and exhorted them concerning matters that pertained specifically to them. End quote from al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 5/191. 
The Standing Committee was asked: Should the imam sit between the two khutbahs of Eid? 
They replied: The two khutbahs of Eid are Sunnah and come after the Eid prayer, because of the report narrated by al-Nasaa’i, Ibn Maajah and Abu Dawood, from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn al-Saa’ib (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: I attended Eid prayer with the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). When he had finished praying he said: “We will deliver a khutbah; whoever wishes to sit and listen to the khutbah, let him do so, and whoever wants to leave, let him do so.” Al-Shawkaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Nayl: al-Musannif (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: This shows that the khutbah is Sunnah; it is were obligatory, it would be obligatory to sit and listen to it. 
It is prescribed for the one who delivers two khutbahs on Eid to separate them by sitting briefly, by analogy with the two khutbahs of Jumu’ah, and because of the report narrated by al-Shaafa’i (may Allaah have mercy on him) from ‘Ubayd ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Utbah (may Allaah have mercy on him) who said: The Sunnah is for the Imam to deliver two khutbahs on Eid, sitting briefly in between them. 
Some scholars are of the view that there is only one khutbah for Eid prayer, because the saheeh ahaadeeth from the Messenger of Allaah SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) speak of only one khutbah. And Allaah knows best. 
End quote from Fataawa Islamiyyah, 1/425 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: Should the imam deliver one khutbah or two on Eid? 
He replied: The well known view among the fuqaha’ (may Allaah have mercy on them) is that there should be two khutbahs on Eid, because of a da’eef hadeeth which was narrated concerning that, but in the hadeeth whose authenticity is agreed upon, it says that the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) only delivered one khutbah. I hope that the matter is flexible. End quote. 
Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 16/246 
He also said (16/248): 
The Sunnah is for there to be one khutbah, but if two khutbahs are given that is fine, because it was narrated that the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) also did that. But the imam should not forget to exhort the women in particular, because the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did that. 
If he is speaking via a microphone and the women can hear him, he should devote the end of his khutbah to exhorting the women in particular. If he is not using a microphone and the women cannot hear him, then he should go to them, accompanied by one or two other men, and say a few words to them. End quote. 
In conclusion: This is a matter that is subject to ijtihaad, and it is flexible. There is no definitive text in the Sunnah concerning this matter, although it seems that it should be one khutbah. Let the imam do whatever he thinks is closest to the Sunnah.
