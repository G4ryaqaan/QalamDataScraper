Creation of Jesus


Miracles of Jesus 


Was Jesus crucified?","Praise be to Allah.What do Muslims believe about Jesus?
Muslims respect and revere Jesus (peace be upon him), and await his second coming. They consider him one of the greatest of God’s messengers to mankind. A Muslim never refers to him simply as `Jesus', but always adds the phrase ""peace be upon him."" 
Creation of Jesus
The Quran confirms his virgin birth (a chapter of the Quran is entitled `Mary') in her time, and Mary is considered the purest woman in all creation. 
The Quran describes the creation of Jesus as follows (interpretation of the meaning): 
""Behold! the Angel said, `God has chosen you, and purified you, and chosen you above the women of all nations. O Mary, God gives you glad tidings of a word from Him, whose name shall be the Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, honored in this world and the Hereafter, and one that shall speak to the people from his cradle and in maturity, and shall be of the righteous.' She said: `O my Lord! How shall I have a son when no man has touched me?' He said: `Even so; God creates what He wills. When He decrees a thing, He but says to it, ""Be!"" and it is."" (Al Imran 3:42-7) 
Jesus (peace be upon him) was born miraculously through the same power which had brought Adam (peace be upon him) into being without a father: ""Truly, the likeness of Jesus unto Allah is as the likeness of Adam. He created him of dust, and then said to him, `Be!' and he was."" (Al Imran 3:59) 
Miracles of Jesus 
During his prophetic mission, Jesus (peace be upon him) was granted and performed many miracles. The Quran tells us that he said (interpretation of meaning): 
""I have come to you with a sign from your Lord: I make for you out of the clay, as it were, the figure of a bird, and breathe into it and it becomes a bird by Allah’s leave. And I heal the blind and the lepers, and I raise the dead by Allah’s leave."" (Al Imran 3:49) 
Other miracles include speaking soon after birth in defense of his mother's piety. God's other gifts to him included healing the blind and the sick, reviving the dead, and, most importantly, the message he was carrying. 
Was Jesus crucified?
These miracles were granted to him by God to establish him as a prophet. According to the Quran, he was not crucified , but it only appeared so; instead, Allah raised him unto Heaven. (An-Nisa 4:157) 
Neither Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him), nor Jesus (peace be upon him), came to change the basic doctrine of the belief in one God , brought by earlier prophets, but to confirm and renew it. 
In the Quran Jesus (peace be upon him), is reported as saying that he came: ""To attest the law which was before me. And to make lawful to you part of what was forbidden you; I have come to you with a sign from your Lord, so fear God and obey me."" (al Imran 3:50)

Giving birth is the right of both husband and wife, and
        neither one of them has the right to deprive the other from doing so.

It is prohibited to take any measure which would
        permanently prevent pregnancy, or cause infertility. It is permissible, however, to use
        temporary birth control methods to delay pregnancy, as in the case of delaying pregnancy
        for the two years of breast feeding the first child.

It is prohibited to use any birth control method which
        would harm the body, as the Prophet  said: ""Do not (impose)

    is no known basis in Islam for putting a crescent on top of the minaret. Some scholars
    forbid doing so and consider it to be something that is newly-innovated in the religion.
    The practice may also contain some element of imitating the kuffaar, especially if it is
    proven that the crescent is a symbol used by those who worship heavenly bodies. So we
    should not use this symbol, and the mosques money should not be spent on something

My question concerns bills related to telephone or university tuition. If you 
delay the payment of the telephone bill they add an extra amount by a certain 
percentage of the bill and if you further delay by another month an extra 
amount is added to the previous total using the same percentage on the whole 
amount. 
Are these extra amounts riba or if it is not riba is it still haram to pay this extra 
amount? 
Jazakallah kheir",,,"Praise be to Allah.Al-hamdu lillaah.
Yes, this extra amount is undoubtedly considered ribaa, as the longer period for 
payment they allow you the more they increase the amount for you to pay. You need to 
refuse this kind of transaction. If you are forced, then pay the original sum without the 
extra amount. If you are forced to pay the extra amount, then pay it while offering 
repentance to Allaah and committing not to deal in such transactions again.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
591,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/591,Abnormal relationship between women,"I am a believer and I am in love with a believer. We are both women and have already had children who we are taking good care of, but their fathers have deserted us . We both want to live as good muslims, but we love each other so much . We have been told culturally that our love is an abomination, however we cannot find anything in the Quran which condemns us or our actions. We are hurting no one. We are employed. We are educating our children and nurturing our families. We know the passage in the Quran about Soddem and Gommorah, but that appears to deal with the rape of men by men. It does not speak to monogamous love between two women. We love Allah and want to do his will. We need more information about our situation.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Just as illicit sexual relations can occur between men, they can also occur between women. The Muslim fuqahaa call this sihaaq (lesbianism), which they define as sexual relations between one woman and another (al-Mufassal fi Ahkaam al-Marah by Zaydaan, 5/450), and state that it is a punishable offence (the punishment is a form of discipline for disobedience; no specific punishment is given in the Quran, so the punishment is to be set by the Qaadi according to the circumstances of the crime and the one who commits it). The lesbians testimony is unacceptable because she is a evildoer (al-Mawsooah al-Fiqhiyyah, 24/253). Ibn Qudaamah, may Allah have mercy on him, said: ""If two women masturbate one another, then they are cursed fornicators"" (al-Mughni 10/162). Some of the scholars, like al-Izz ibn Abd al-Salaam say that a lesbian is not permitted to look at a Muslim woman, and that a Muslim woman is not permitted to uncover (take off her hijaab) in front of a lesbian, because she is an evildoer who cannot be trusted not to describe her to others.
If what is described above is the nature of the relationship between the two women mentioned in the question, then they must repent sincerely to Allah and stop their evil actions. If their being together in one place will lead to them committing this sin, then they must never meet, so as to avoid this wrongful act. Their husbands desertion of them may be one of the reasons for them falling into this kind of perversion, because they have no legitimate way in which to fulfil their desires and so they have resorted to this haraam way. So they must think seriously of finding Muslim husbands with whom they can live in the way prescribed by Islam.
 
As for love, this is a different kind of sin, which need not necessarily be associated with physical desire. It is dangerous because it leads to the lover worshipping the beloved, so that he thinks only of the one he loves, cannot bear to be parted from him by day and dreams about him at night; he lives and dies for his sake, and may change when he sees him and become sick when he is absent. This kind of relationship destroys a persons mental health and destroys his relationship with his Lord, because it makes the lover worship his beloved and it is haraam to worship anything other than Allah.
The solution to this disastrous situation is total separation, so that one will never see that person, or hear news of him again.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
596,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/596,Ruling on going to parties where there is alcohol and music,"Can A Muslim attend a finish where there is Alcohol Being Served Rfo: I am in the army and there is an Army Ball and I told my supervisor I could not go because of the Music and alcohol , He said just do not drink and go. Well, I want some Daleel on the subject",,,"Praise be to Allah.Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): "" And if Shaytaan causes you to forget, then after the remembrance sit not in the company of those people who are the zaalimoon (polytheists and wrong-doers, etc.)."" [al-An'aam 6:68]
 
Jaabir (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""Whoever believes in Allah and the last day, should not sit at a table where wine is being served."" (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, no. 2801; classed as saheeh in Saheeh al-Jaami', 6506).
 
Abu Sa'eed al-Khudri said: ""The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: 'Allah will ask His slave on the Day of Resurrection until He says: What prevented you, when you saw something evil, from denouncing it?'"" According to another report: ""One of you will be asked on the Day of Resurrection until he is asked: What prevented you from denouncing evil when you saw it?"" (Reported by Imaam Ahmad and Ibn Maajah, 4017; see also Saheeh al-Jaami', 1818).
 
I think that now, my brother, you will know the ruling concerning going to parties where there is wine and other evils.
