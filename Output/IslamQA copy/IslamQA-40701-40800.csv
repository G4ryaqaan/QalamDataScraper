Do the jinn have a real form?,"The jinn may appear in human and animal form, so they may appear as snakes and scorpions etc, or in the form of camels, cattle, sheep, horses, mules and donkeys, or in the form of birds, or in the form of humans.","Do the jinn appear in human form?


Are the jinn real?","Praise be to Allah.Do the jinn appear in human form?
It should be noted that the basic principle concerning the jinn is that they are concealed from mankind, hence they are called jinn, because the Arabic root janna refers to a single original meaning which is to cover and conceal, as Ibn Faris said in Maqayis al-Lughah. 
The jinn are so called because they are concealed from mankind, and the fetus is called janin in Arabic because he is concealed in his mother’s womb, and a garden is called jannah because it is concealed by trees, and an insane person is called majnun because his mind is covered, and so on in all derivations from this root. 
Allah has told us of this when He said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O Children of Adam! Let not Shaytan (Satan) deceive you, as he got your parents [Adam and Hawwa] out of Paradise, stripping them of their raiments, to show them their private parts. Verily, he and Qabiluhu (his soldiers from the jinn or his tribe) see you from where you cannot see them.” [Al-A`raf 7:27] 
The answer to this is that it is proven in the sunnah (prophetic teachings) and from real life that the jinn appear in different forms, such as the forms of people and animals, etc. Among the clearest evidence of that from the sunnah is the story narrated by al-Bukhari from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) put me in charge of guarding the zakah (poor-due) of Ramadan. Someone came to me and started scooping up some of the food, and I said, “By Allah, I will take you to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).” He complained of being in need and having dependents, so Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) took pity on him and let him go. This happened three times, and on the third occasion, Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I will take you to the Messenger of Allah. This is the third time and each time you say that you will not come back, then you come back.” He said, “Let me go and I will teach you something by means of which Allah will benefit you.” I said: “What is it?” He said: “When you go to bed, recite Ayat al-Kursi, ‘Allah! La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), Al-Hayyul-Qayyum (the Ever Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists)…’ [Al-Baqarah 2:255] until you complete the verse, then you will always have a protector from Allah, and no devil will come near you until morning comes. So I let him go, and the next morning I told the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) what had happened. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “He told you the truth, although he is a liar. Do you know who you have been speaking to for three nights, O Abu Hurayrah?” He said: “No.” He said: “That was a devil (a shaytan).” 
Al-Hafiz ibn Hajar said in al-Fath: “This hadith (narration) teaches us a number of things… that one of the characteristics of the shaytan is lying, and that he may appear in various forms that may be seen, and that the words of Allah, “Verily, he and Qabiluhu (his soldiers from the jinn or his tribe) see you from where you cannot see them” [Al-A`raf 7:27], apply to when he is in the form with which he was created.” 
It was narrated that the shaytan appeared to Quraysh in the form of Suraqah ibn Malik ibn Ju’sham and encouraged them to fight the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). This happened during the battle of Badr. Ibn Jarir al-Tabari narrated in his Tafsir that ‘Urwah ibn al-Zubayr said: 
When Quraysh decided to march, mention was made of what was between them and Bani Bakr – i.e., war – and that almost made them change their minds. Then Iblis appeared to them in the form of Suraqah ibn Ju’sham al-Madlaji, who was one of the nobles of Banu Kinanah, and said: “I will protect you against Kinanah so that Kinanah will not be able to do you any harm.” So they went ahead with their plan. This was also quoted by Ibn Kathir in al-Bidayah wa’l-Nihayah. 
In Sahih Muslim, it is narrated that Abu Sa’id al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “In Madinah, there is a group of the jinn who have become Muslim, so whoever sees any of these creatures let him give it a warning three times, then if it appears after that he may kill it, for it is a devil.” 
The word translated as “creatures” here refers to kinds of snakes that appear in houses; they are not to be killed until they have been given a warning three times, because they may be jinn. (See Gharib al-Hadith by Ibn al-Athir) 
Al-Nawawi said: “What this means is that if they do not disappear after being warned, then they are not the kind of creatures that inhabit houses and they are not among the jinn who have become Muslim, rather that is a devil so there is no sin on you if you kill it and Allah will never give the shaytan a way to prevail over you by taking revenge, unlike the creatures (snakes) and jinn who have become Muslim. And Allah knows best.” (Sharh Muslim) 
There have been many such incidents. Shaykh al-Islam (Ibn Taymiyah) said: “The jinn may appear in human and animal form , so they may appear as snakes and scorpions etc, or in the form of camels, cattle, sheep, horses, mules and donkeys, or in the form of birds, or in the form of humans, as the shaytan came to Quraysh in the form of Suraqah ibn Malik ibn Ju’sham when they wanted to set out for Badr.
The jinn have led many people astray by appearing in the forms of awliya (saints) and righteous people etc. 
Shaykh al-Islam said: 
“The shaytan often appears in the form of the person who is being called upon and asked for help, if he is dead or sometimes if he is alive, without the person who called upon him realizing it. Indeed the shaytan may appear in his form and the misguided mushrik (pagan) who is seeking that person’s help may think that the person himself has responded to him when in fact it is the shaytan. This also happens to the kuffar (non-Muslims) who seek the help of those of whom they think well, whether they are dead or alive, such as the Christians who seek the help of George or others of their saints, and it happens to those so-called Muslims who commit shirk (polytheism) and follow misguidance by seeking the help of those who are dead or absent. The shaytan appears to them in the form of the one upon whom they call, without them realizing it… More than one person has told me that they sought my help, and each of them told me a different story. I told each one of them that I did not answer any one of them and I did not know that they were seeking my help. It was said that this was an angel, but I said: Angels do not help mushriks, rather that was a devil who wanted to misguide him.” (Majmu` al-Fatawa, 19:47-8) 
One of the greatest ways in which a Muslim may seek help against the devils is to “fortify” himself with adhkar (words of remembrance) and reciting Ayat al-Kursiy , as stated in the hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) quoted above. 
Are the jinn real?
With regard to this matter of photographs of the jinn, which have fascinated many people and become widespread on some websites, it is not possible to verify the authenticity of what is in these websites, especially nowadays when people are highly skilled in producing all kinds of deceptive pictures. Moreover, researching such matters brings no spiritual or worldly benefit and serves no purpose. It is better to occupy oneself with things that will bring spiritual or worldly benefit such as reading and understanding what is in the Quran and the sahih sunnah (authentic prophetic teachings), and what a person needs to know and do of correct belief and worship, and the proper attitude and etiquette which the Muslim should develop, and so on. It should also be noted that publishing pictures of animate beings is haram (impermissible) according to shari’ah (Islamic law) as is stated in the texts.

We ask Allah to protect you and raise you in status and forgive your sins and bless you with knowledge and good deeds, for He is the Best One to be asked.  
May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and Companions.

40720,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/40720,"If countries differ with regard to when Ramadaan begins and when the day of ‘Arafah is, with whom should I fast?","Because of some personal circumstances we moved to Pakistan, where a lot of things are different, such as the time of prayer, etc. I want to ask you: I am keen to fast on the day of ‘Arafah, but the Hijri date in Pakistan is different from the date in Saudi: when the date in Pakistan is the 8th of the month, it is the 9th in Saudi. Should I fast on the 8th – which is the 9th in Saudi – or should I fast according to the date in Pakistan?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: what if the day of ‘Arafah is different because of the moon being sighted at different times in different countries? Should we fast according to the moon sighting in the country where we are or according to the moon sighting in al-Haramayn (the two Holy Sanctuaries)? 
He replied: This is based on a difference of opinion among the scholars: Is there only one moon sighting for the whole world or does it vary according to when the moon rises in different places? 
 
The correct view is that it varies according to when the moon rises in different places. For example, if the moon is sighted in Makkah, and today is the ninth, and it is sighted elsewhere one day before Makkah, and the day of ‘Arafah in Makkah is the tenth for them, it is not permissible for them to fast on this day because it is Eid. Similarly if it so happens that they sight the moon after Makkah, and the 9
th in Makkah is the 8th for them, then they should fast the day that is the 9th for them, which is the 10th in Makkah. This is the correct view, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When you see it (the new moon) fast and when you see it break your fast.” Those who did not see the moon in their own location have not seen it. Just as people are unanimously agreed that the times for dawn and sunset vary according to their own location, so too the months are also worked out by location, just like the daily timings. 
Majmoo’ al-Fatawa, 20. 
And he (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about some people who worked in the Saudi embassy in a foreign country, who said that they were having a problem concerning the fast of Ramadan and the fast on the day of ‘Arafah. The brothers there had split into three groups: 
One group said: we will fast with Saudi and break the fast with Saudi. 
Another group said: we will fast with the country where we are living and break the fast with them. 
The last group said: we will fast Ramadan with the country where we are living, but we will fast the day of ‘Arafah with Saudi. 
They asked the Shaykh to provide them with a detailed answer concerning the Ramadan fast and fasting the day of ‘Arafah, whilst noting that for the past five years, in the country where they were living neither Ramadan nor the day of ‘Arafah had been observed on the same days as in Saudi; their Ramadan started one or two days after it had been announced in Saudi, and sometimes three days after. 
He replied: 
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful 
The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) differed concerning the issue when the moon is sighted in one part of the Muslim world and not in another: do all the Muslims have to act on the basis of that, or only those who sighted it and the people who live in the same region, or only those who sighted it and the people who live under the same government? There are many different points of view. 
The most correct view is that the matter should be referred to those who have knowledge of it. If the moon rises at the same point for two countries they become like one country, so if it is sighted in one of them that ruling applies to the other. But if the rising points differ, then each country has its own ruling. This is the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him); this is the apparent meaning of the texts of the Qur’aan and Sunnah and what is implied by analogy.  
In the Qur’aan it says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So whoever of you sights (the crescent on the first night of) the month (of Ramadan i.e. is present at his home), he must observe Sawm (fasts) that month, and whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number [of days which one did not observe Sawm (fasts) must be made up] from other days. Allah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you. (He wants that you) must complete the same number (of days), and that you must magnify Allah [i.e. to say Takbeer (Allahu Akbar: Allah is the Most Great)] for having guided you so that you may be grateful to Him”
[al-Baqarah 2:185]
What is implied by this verse is that whoever does not see it is not obliged to fast. 
In the Sunnah, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When you see it (the new moon) then fast, and when you see it, break your fast.” What is implied by this hadeeth is that if we did not see it we are not obliged to fast or to break the fast. 
With regard to analogy, the times for starting and ending the fast each day should be worked out in each country on its own, according to the local times of sunrise and sunset. This is a point on which there is scholarly consensus. So you see the people in east Asia starting their fast before the people of west Asia, and breaking their fast before them, because dawn breaks for the former before the latter, and the sun sets for the former before the latter. 
Once this is established with regard to the times for starting and ending the daily fast, it also applies to the start and end of the monthly fast. There is no difference between them. 
But if many regions come under the same government, and the ruler gives the command for the fast to start or end, then his command must be followed, because this is a matter of scholarly dispute but the command of the ruler dispels that dispute. 
Based on the above, you should fast and break your fast along with the people of the country where you are living, whether that is in accordance with your country of origin or not. Similarly on the day of ‘Arafah you should follow the country where you are living.

40752,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/40752,Ruling on selling exorbitantly expensive telephone numbers and “custom” licence plates,"What is the ruling on buying and selling telephone numbers and custom licence plates. If a person buys a custom licence plate then sells it, is that money halaal?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
      Every Muslim should realize that Allaah has forbidden 
      extravagance and wasteful spending, which both mean going beyond the limit 
      in spending money. 

    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “and eat and drink but waste not by extravagance, 
    certainly He (Allaah) likes not Al‑Musrifoon (those who waste by 
    extravagance)”

    [al-A’raaf 7:31] 

    “And give to the kinsman his due and to the Miskeen (poor) 
    and to the wayfarer. But spend not wastefully (your wealth) in the manner of 
    a spendthrift. 

    27. Verily, the spendthrifts are brothers of the 
    Shayaateen (devils), and the Shaytaan (Devil‑Satan) is ever ungrateful to 
    his Lord”

    [al-Isra’ 17:26-27]

    Every Muslim should realize that he will not be sent either 
    to Paradise or to Hell until Allaah has asked him about several things, one 
    of which is his wealth – from where he acquired it and on what he spent it. 

    It was narrated that Abu Barzah al-Aslami (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) said: The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “A person will not move on (on the Day of Judgement) until 
    he has been asked about four things: his life and in what he spent it, his 
    knowledge and what he did with it, his wealth, from where he acquired it and 
    on what he spent it, and his body and how he wore it out.” 

    Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2317. He said: It is hasan saheeh. 
    It was classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Targheeb 
    wa’l-Raheeb, 126. 

    Moreover it should be noted that buying distinct mobile phone 
    numbers and car licence plates for thousands of riyals is a kind of 
    extravagance and wasteful spending on haraam things. Allaah will ask every 
    one of these people about his wealth and what he spent on such things.  

    Especially since we see the Muslims in most parts of the 
    world suffering misery and hardship in their lives. Some of them cannot find 
    a morsel of food with which to ward off hunger, and others cannot find 
    clothes with which to cover their bodies, or a house in which to shelter 
    themselves, and the houses of some of them have been destroyed with them 
    inside. 

    Yet at such a time of hardship we find some Muslims buying a 
    licence plate with the number “1” for the equivalent of 2.18 million dollars 
    in an auction! 

    In the same auction, the licence plate bearing the number “2” 
    was sold for the equivalent of 1.11 million dollars. The organizers of the 
    auction said that the turnover of the auction on the first day was nearly 
    3.9 million dollars. 

    It is similar with mobile phone numbers where a number was 
    sold for the equivalent of 360,000 dollars.  

    This madness has spread in a number of countries where it 
    would have been better for them to help the Muslims and keep their wealth 
    safe from such foolishness, extravagance and waste. 

    It should be noted that what makes these people buy such 
    things is deplorable attitudes such as arrogance, pride and feelings of 
    superiority. One of the most ridiculous comments that was made on this 
    matter was that which was published by one of the newspapers which spoke of 
    a man who came to ask for the hand of a girl in marriage, and he said to the 
    girl’s father: “You do not need to ask about me; look at my licence plate 
    and you will know who I am.” 

    It may also be noted that the price for a distinct number or 
    licence plate is many times greater than the price of a Rolls Royce which in 
    the Emirates costs between 1 million and 1.5 million dirhams, and it may 
    cost five times as much as a high-end car like a Mercedes, or ten times as 
    much as a famous car such as a Lexus, which is favoured by the rich. 

    How much food and drink and clothing, or even telephones and 
    cars, could this have bought for those who need them? How many young men 
    could have been kept chaste by spending this money on getting them married? 
    How many debtors in prison could have been set free by paying off their 
    debts? How many of those who are misguided could have been brought back to 
    the straight path if this money had been spent on the distribution of books 
    and tapes?  

    All that a custom plate does is tell others that its owner is 
    distinguished by his naivety and concern with trivial matters. A custom 
    plate – unlike the car itself – is not a product of technology which people 
    seek out because it offers comfort, speed or safety. A custom plate is not 
    something that you can enjoy looking at – like some kinds of birds. It is 
    just a sign of arrogance, pride and wasteful spending. 

    If a special phone number is used by a store or business, or 
    by an important department that people need to contact, then there would be 
    a point in buying it, so long as the price does not reach the exorbitant 
    levels described above.  

    But buying a special phone number is, to a large extent, akin 
    to wearing a garment of fame or vanity, which is forbidden. 

    “Whoever puts on a garment of fame or vanity, Allaah will 
    clothe him with a garment like it (or a garment of humiliation) on the Day 
    of Resurrection.” Some reports add: “Then He will set it ablaze.” 

    Narrated by Abu Dawood, 4029; Ibn Maajah, 3607. 

    Ibn al-Qayyim said: 

    That is because his intention in wearing it was to show off 
    and act proud, so Allaah will punish him with the opposite of that and will 
    humiliate him, just as He punished the one who made his garment long by 
    causing him to be swallowed up by the earth, and he will continue sinking 
    into it until the Day of Resurrection. 

    Zaad al-Ma’aad, 1/145, 146 

    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: 
It is makrooh to wear a 
    garment of fame and vanity, which is anything that stands out from the 
    ordinary, whether it is by wearing the finest and most expensive garments or 
    by wearing the cheapest and scruffiest. The salaf disliked both extremes. 
    According to the hadeeth, “Whoever wears a garment of fame and vanity, 
    Allaah will clothe him in a garment of humiliation.” The best of all matters 
    is that which is moderate. 

    Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 22/138 

    In conclusion: 
It is not permissible to 
    buy and sell these custom numbers. Even if it may be permissible in some 
    cases, it is not permissible to sell them for such high prices. 

    The one whom Allaah has blessed with wealth should be 
    grateful for this blessing and take proper care of it. He should not spend 
    it on things that incur the wrath of Allaah or things which serve no 
    purpose. He should realize that he will be questioned about this wealth on 
    the Day of Resurrection and will be asked from where he acquired it and on 
    what he spent it.
