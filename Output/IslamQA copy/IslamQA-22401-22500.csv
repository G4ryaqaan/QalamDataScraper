    It is not permissible to sell haraam things 
    such as cigarettes, promiscuous magazines or magazines that promote evil, 
    even if they are published by Muslims, because when Allaah forbids a thing 
    He also forbids its price. It is not permissible to work for these magazines 
    because this is a kind of cooperating in sin and transgression. The income 
    from such sales is haraam. A person has to fear Allaah with regard to his 
    food and drink and all his spending. Selling gas is permissible, and there 
    is nothing wrong with it. If the taxes are compulsory then the one who is 
    forced to do a thing will be forgiven.",Shaykh ‘Abd al-Kareem al-Khudayr
22407,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22407,Her brother committed suicide and she is asking serious questions about the will of Allaah,"My younger brother died by hanging himself. He was only 25 yrs.old. The problem was a small tiff between my mother and himself. We are all deeply shocked and very much grieved. There are so many questions that I would like to ask you regarding this situation. Firstly, why did Allah choose this kind of death for my brother. Secondly, my father is 65 yrs old and he is very pious and my mother is extremely kind and gentle. Why did Allah show this day in their lives? Thirdly, how can we help him (my brother) who is no more? How can we see him in jannat? Can we convey our salam to him? Will our salam reach him?
 Also, after we did autopsy we found out that his death was not because of strangulation but because his spinal cord broke. Actually what happened was, there was a swing made out of a cloth for my kid in the room. My brother he took a stool which was nearby and tied it around his neck saying i will take my life. My mother was in the same room, praying. We feel it was not suicide, maybe it was his anger which made him do this.
His friends tell us that he was not the kind to commit suicide. In fact he used to advice his friends against it if they mentioned it.
His funeral was also good and his face did not look like he was suffering or anything. It looked like he was sleeping and we just had to wake him up. Does this indicate  
Please reply to this as we are very troubled by this sudden demise.",,,"Praise be to Allah.In dealing with these questions we must note three things, which are: 
1 – Everything happens by the will and decree of Allaah. Everything that happens in this universe, good or bad, happens by the decree of Allaah, under His control and by His will, for there is no lord except Him and no controller besides Him. 
2 – We must believe that He is wise in all that He decrees, for His is the utmost wisdom in all that happens in this universe, whether we understand that or not. Indeed, much of Allaah’s wisdom cannot be comprehended by the minds of His slaves. So we must submit to Allaah, by believing that His wisdom is perfect. It is not permissible for us to object to Him, whether that means objecting to His laws or to His decrees. 
3 – Suicide is a major sin and a bad end. The one who kills himself in order to escape calamities or poverty or the results of distress or anger has, by doing that, exposed himself to the punishment of Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“… And do not kill yourselves (nor kill one another). Surely, Allaah is Most Merciful to you.
And whoever commits that through aggression and injustice, We shall cast him into the Fire, and that is easy for Allaah”
[al-Nisa’ 4:29-30]
And it was narrated in al-Saheehayn that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever kills himself with a piece of iron, that iron will be in his hand and he will be stabbing himself in the stomach with it in Hell for ever and ever. Whoever kills himself with poison, that poison will be in his hand and he will be drinking it in Hell…” 
Whatever happened in this case, we must refer the matter to Allaah. What appears to be the case is that what happened was suicide, because he hung himself, i.e., he tied a rope around his neck and strangled himself. So either he committed suicide or he wanted to commit suicide. And Allaah knows best. 
As for the righteousness of the parents, this does not mean that Allaah will not test them with some calamities, so as to show their patience and so as to erase thereby their sins. For the believer’s whole affair is good: if something good happens to him he gives thanks for it, and that is good for him, and if something bad happens to him, he bears it with patience, and that is good for him, and this applies only to the believer. So being tested with calamities does not mean that the believer is insignificant before Allaah if he is righteous and obeys Allaah. For belief in Allaah, obeying Him and fearing Him are the means that lead to one being honoured by Allaah, and kufr, immorality and disobedience are the means that lead to one being regarded as worthless by Allaah. Whoever is tested with some calamity and bears that with patience, that will raise him in status. Calamities are of different kinds, it may be a sickness, or loss of wealth, or loss of a loved one such as a son, brother, father, husband or wife. Allaah tests His slaves with ease and with calamities, with good and bad, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and We shall make a trial of you with evil and with good. And to Us you will be returned”[al-Anbiya’ 21:35]
If the suicide stemmed from ignorance and the person was righteous and obeyed Allaah, and prayed regularly, then there is the hope that Allaah may forgive him, for He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy. However, if he knew of the ruling on suicide, but he resorted to that in order to get rid of a problem from which he was suffering, then there is the danger that he is included in the warning of the punishment narrated in the hadeeth. But nevertheless he was still a believer in Allaah and His Messenger and a follower of Tawheed, not a mushrik, so he is subject to the will of Allaah. If Allaah wills He will forgive him, and if He wills he will punish him, but even if He punishes him He will eventually bring him forth from the Fire, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, Allaah forgives not that partners should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He wills”[al-Nisa’ 4:48]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Everyone who says Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah (there is no god except Allaah) and has an atom’s-weight of faith in his heart will be brought forth from the Fire.” 
With regard to his washing and preparation for burial, and his good appearance, that may indeed be a sign that his situation is good, that the consequences will be good for him and that he is excused and forgiven by his Lord. But we cannot be certain about any of these things, although these signs may give us hope. If the one who committed suicide was a Muslim, a follower of Tawheed and one who prayed regularly, then we can show kindness towards him by praying for forgiveness for him and asking Allaah to forgive him his sins, and to forgive him for whatever he did to himself that ended up in suicide. 
With regard to what is said in the question criticizing the way which Allaah chose for him to die, this is a kind of objecting to the decree of Allaah. Allaah is the One Who decrees; He is the Creator of all things, and all things are subject to His decree. He is the Most Wise, the All-Knowing, but whatever action is done that goes against His law cannot be justified by saying that this is the decree of Allaah. Whatever happens in the universe of such events does not mean that it is permissible to object to the decree of Allaah, rather we are obliged to believe in the Divine decree and in the Wisdom of the Lord, may He be glorified and exalted.",Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Barraak

22422,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22422,The meaning of “small faults”,"Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“Those who avoid great sins and Al‑Fawaahish (illegal sexual intercourse) except the small faults…”

[al-Najm 53:32] 

What is meant by the word lamam (translated here as “small faults”) in this verse?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    This verse appears in Soorat al-Najm, where Allaah describes 
    the attributes of the doers of good who are the people of Paradise. Allaah 
    says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And to Allaah belongs all that is in the heavens and all 
    that is in the earth, that He may requite those who do evil with that which 
    they have done (i.e. punish them in Hell), and reward those who do good, 
    with what is best (i.e. Paradise).
32. Those who avoid great 
    sins and Al‑Fawaahish (illegal sexual intercourse) except the small faults,  
    verily, your Lord is of vast forgiveness”

    [al-Najm 53:31-32]

    The mufassireen and imams differed as to what is meant by 
    lamam (translated here as “small faults”). Their views include the 
    following: 

    1-It was narrated from a number 
    of the salaf that it refers to committing a sin once, then not repeating it, 
    even if it is a major sin. Al-Baghawi said: This is the view of Abu 
    Hurayrah, Mujaahid and al-Hasan, and was narrated from Ibn 'Abbaas.

    2-Sa’eed ibn al-Musayyab said 
    that it refers to what crosses one’s mind.

    3-Al-Hasan ibn al-Fadl said: 
    Lamam (“small faults”) refers to a look that is not deliberate, which is 
    forgiven. But if a person looks again, this is no longer a small fault, 
    rather it is a sin.

    4-A group of scholars were of the 
    view that lamam refers to what they did during the Jaahiliyyah, 
    before they became Muslim, so Allaah will not take them to task for it. That 
    is because the mushrikoon said to the Muslims: “Yesterday you used to do 
    these things alongside us.” So Allaah revealed this verse. This is the view 
    of Zayd ibn Thaabit and Zayd ibn Aslam.

    5-The majority of scholars are of 
    the view that lamam refers to minor sins.

    Al-Bukhaari (2643) narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) said: I have never seen anything that explains lamam 
    more clearly than what Abu Hurayrah narrated from the Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Allaah has decreed for the son of 
    Adam his share of zina (adultery), which he will inevitably commit. The zina 
    of the eyes is looking, the zina of the tongue is speaking, the zina of the 
    heart is wishing and longing, and the private parts will confirm that or 
    deny it.” 

    Al-Raaghib said: Lamam means committing sin, and 
    refers to minor sins.  

    What is meant by lamam is that which Allaah mentioned 
    in the verse where He said (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Those who avoid great sins and Al‑Fawaahish (illegal 
    sexual intercourse) except the small faults (lamam)…”

    [al-Najm 53:32]

    … which is forgivable. 

    And Allaah says in another verse (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “If you avoid the great sins which you are forbidden to 
    do, We shall expiate from you your (small) sins (lamam)…”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:31]

    It may be understood from these two verses that lamam 
    refers to small sins, which will be expiated by avoidance of major sins. 

    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) quoted the words of 
    al-Khattaabi, then he said: 

    This is the correct interpretation of the word lamam. 
    And it was said that it means thinking of doing something but then not doing 
    it; or an inclination towards sin but not persisting in it. And there are 
    other views which are not clear. The basic meaning of the word lamam 
    is an inclination towards something and seeking it, but not on an ongoing 
    basis. And Allaah knows best. 

    Al-Haafiz said: 

    What may be understood from the words of Ibn ‘Abbaas is that 
    the word lamam refers to specific minor sins, or it may be understood 
    that these minor sins are one of the things meant by lamam. 

    Al-Tirmidhi (3284) narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him): “If you avoid the great sins which you are forbidden 
    to do, We shall expiate from you your (small) sins…” [al-Nisa’ 4:31]. 
    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When You 
    forgive, O Allaah, You forgive a great deal, for who among Your slaves has 
    not committed sin?” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 

    It says in Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi: 

    The scholars differed concerning the meaning of lamam, 
    but the majority are of the view that it refers to minor sins. This view 
    appears to be correct. 

    Al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    “except the small faults” refers to minor sins which 
    no one can avoid falling into except the one whom Allaah protects. 

    Ibn Jareer said: 

    The most correct view concerning this, in my opinion, is the 
    view of those who say that “illa” (except) is istithna’ munqati’(an 
    exception where the thing excluded is not of the same type as the things 
    mentioned before the word illa). What is meant by the phrase “Those 
    who avoid great sins and Al‑Fawaahish (illegal sexual intercourse) except 
    the small faults” is faults that are less serious than major sins and 
    immoral actions that incur hadd punishments in this world and 
    punishment in the Hereafter. They will be forgiven for these small faults. 
    In my view this is akin to the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of 
    the meaning): 
“If you avoid the great 
    sins which you are forbidden to do, We shall expiate from you your (small) 
    sins, and admit you to a Noble Entrance (i.e. Paradise)”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:31]

    So in return for avoidance of major sins, Allaah has promised 
    forgiveness for lesser sins, of which the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) said: “The eyes commit zina, the hands commit zina, 
    the feet commit zina, and the private parts confirm that or deny it.” That 
    is because there is no hadd punishment for anything less than intercourse. 
    This is forgiveness from Allaah in this world, whereby a person is let off 
    the punishment, and Allaah is too generous to go back to something that He 
    has forgiven. End quote. 

    In the saheeh Sunnah, the word lamam is used to refer 
    to one who commits a sin once, but does not persist in it. This is in 
    accordance with the meaning of the word lamam in Arabic. 

    In hadeeth al-ifk (the hadeeth which tells the story 
    of the lie fabricated against ‘Aa’ishah) it says: 

    “If it so happened that you committed a sin (in kunti 
    almamti bi dhanbin) then ask Allaah for forgiveness.”

    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2661; Muslim, 2770. 

    Al-Nawawi said: What this means is: if you have a committed a 
    sin which is not something that you usually do. This is the basic meaning of 
    the word lamam. 

    Al-Sa’di (may Allaah have mercy on him) reconciled between 
    the two meanings in his Tafseer, where he says (p. 976): 

    “Those who avoid great sins and Al‑Fawaahish (illegal 
    sexual intercourse)” means: they do the duties that Allaah has enjoined 
    upon them, omission of which is a major sin, and they abstain from major 
    forbidden actions such as zina, drinking alcohol, consuming riba, murder, 
    and other major sins, “except the small faults”, i.e., minor sins in 
    which a person does not persist, or which a person may do rarely. The fact 
    that he may have done them does not mean that he is no longer regarded as a 
    doer of good. If he also does the duties that are required of him and avoids 
    haraam things, he will be forgiven by Allaah, Whose forgiveness encompasses 
    all things. Hence Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  
“verily, your Lord is of 
    vast forgiveness”

    [al-Najm 53:32]

    Were it not for His forgiveness, all lands and people would 
    be doomed. Were it not for His pardon and forbearance, the heavens would 
    fall upon the earth, and no creature would be left alive on the face of the 
    earth. Hence the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said: “The five daily prayers, from one Jumu’ah to the next and from one 
    Ramadaan to the next, are an expiation for whatever (sins) come in between 
    them, so long as you avoid major sins.” 

    The verse does not mean that we are given permission to 
    commit small faults or minor sins. Rather what it means is that if we avoid 
    major sins, then whatever minor sins we fall into by mistake will be 
    forgiven because of that avoidance of major sins.

Prophet Muhammad used to command his agents to take Zakah from those who owed Zakah, and he did not tell them to ask them whether they had any debts or not.",,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) also said:
“The one who has any “zakatable” wealth must pay Zakah on it, when one year has passed since he acquired it, even if he has debts, according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions, because of the general meaning of the evidence that Zakah is obligatory upon everyone who has wealth on which Zakah is due, if one year has passed since he acquired it, even if he has debts. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to command his agents to take Zakah from those who owed Zakah, and he did not tell them to ask them whether they had any debts or not. If having debts meant that one did not have to pay Zakah , the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would have told his agents to ask the people who were paying Zakah whether they had any debts or not.” (Majmu` Fatawa wa Maqalat Mutanawwi`ah, 14/51) 
Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) also said:
“… But if you pay off the debt with cash in hand before one year has passed, there is no Zakah on what you have spent to pay off the debt; rather Zakah is due on whatever is left, if one year has passed and it reaches the minimum threshold (Nisab).” 
Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about a person who has capital worth two hundred thousand riyals and owed a debt of two hundred thousand riyals, and was paying it off at a rate of ten thousand per year – does he have to pay Zakah? 
He replied: 
“Yes, he has to pay Zakah on the wealth that is in his possession, because the texts which speak of the obligation of Zakah are general in meaning, and do not make any exceptions. No exception is made for one who is in debt. As the texts are general in meaning, we have to follow them. 
Moreover, Zakah must be paid on wealth, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Take Sadaqah (Zakah) from their wealth in order to purify them and sanctify them with it, and invoke Allah for them. Verily, your invocations are a source of security for them; and Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower.” [At-Tawbah 9:103]
And according to the Hadith narrated by Al-Bukhari from Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him), when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sent Mu`adh (may Allah be pleased with him) to Yemen he said: “Tell them that Allah has enjoined Zakah from their wealth.” So Allah and His Messenger have stated that Zakah has to do with the wealth itself, not with the person`s obligations towards others; debt has to do with personal obligations towards others. They are two separate issues, so Zakah must be paid from the wealth that is in your possession, and the debt is a personal responsibility.  
Each person must fear his Lord and pay Zakah on the wealth that is in his possession, and seek the help of Allah to pay the debt that he owes, saying: O Allah, pay off the debt that I owe and make me independent of means. 
Perhaps if he pays Zakah on the wealth that is in his possession, that may be a means of bringing blessing to this wealth and causing it to grow, so that he may discharge his duty of paying his debts. If he withholds Zakah, however, that may be a cause of his becoming poor, so that he always sees himself as being in need and not able to pay Zakah. Praise Allah if He makes you one of the givers and not one of the takers.” (Majmu` Fatawa Al-Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin, 18/39) 
And he said, in another Fatwa on the same issue (18/38): 
“If the debt is currently due and repayment is being demanded, and he wants to pay it off, in that case we say: Pay off the debt, then pay Zakah on what is left after that if it reaches the minimum threshold at which Zakah becomes due. 
That is supported by what the Hanbali jurists said about Zakat Al-fitr. They said that being in debt does not mean that one should not pay it. 
Similarly, it is reported that `Uthman (may Allah be pleased with him) used to say during the month of Ramadan: “This is the month of your Zakah, but whoever is in debt, let him pay it off.” This indicates that if a debt is currently due to be paid, and the debtor wants to pay it off, that should take precedence over Zakah. But if a debt is not yet due to be paid off, the Zakah must still be paid, beyond a doubt.”  
It says in Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da`imah (9/189): 
“The correct scholarly view is that being in debt does not mean that Zakah should not be paid. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to send his agents to collect the Zakah, and he did not tell them to see if the people were in debt or not.”

11.	When hearing the crowing of a rooster
12.	Du`a of one who is sick",,"Praise be to Allah.There are many times and places where du`a is answered. There follows a summary thereof: 

Laylat al-Qadar . ‘Aishah asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “If I know what night is Laylat al-Qadar, what should I say during it?” He said: “Say: Allahumma innaka 'afuwwun tuhibb ul-‘afwa fa’fu ‘anni (O Allah, You are forgiving and love forgiveness, so forgive me).” 
 Du`a in the depths of the night, the time before dawn, the time when Allah descends to bestow His bounty upon His slaves, to meet their needs and to relieve their distress, when He says: “Who will call upon Me, that I may answer Him? Who will ask of Me, that I may give him? Who will seek My forgiveness, that I may forgive him?” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1145) 
Following the prescribed prayers . According to the hadith of Abu Umamah, it was said: “O Messenger of Allah, which du`a is heard?” He said: “In the last third of the night, and following the prescribed prayers.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3499; classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi. 

There was some difference of scholarly opinion concerning the phrase dubur al-salawat al-maktubah (“following the prescribed prayers”) – does it mean before the salam or afterwards? 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and his student Ibn al-Qayyim were of the view that it is before the salam. Ibn Taymiyah said: “The word dubur refers to something that is part of a thing, like dubur al-hayawan (the hindquarters of an animal).” Zad al-Ma'ad, 1.305. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said: “What has been narrated of du`a following the prayer is before the salam and what has been narrated of dhikr following the prayer is after the salam, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“When you have finished As-Salah (the congregational prayer), remember Allah standing, sitting down, and (lying down) on your sides.” [al-Nisa 4:103]  (See: Kitab al-Du`a by Shaykh Muhammad al-Hamad, p. 54)

Between the adhan and the iqamah. It is narrated in a sahih report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “A du`a offered between the adhan and iqamah is not rejected.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud (521) and al-Tirmidhi (212). See also Sahih al-Jami’, 2408) 
When the call for the prescribed prayers is given and when the ranks are drawn up for battle, as it says in the marfu' hadith of Sahl ibn Sa’d: “There are two that will not be rejected, or will rarely be rejected: du`a at the time of the call for prayer and at the time of battle when the fighting begins.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud; it is a sahih report. See Sahih al-Jami’, 3079) 
When rain falls , as it said in the hadith of Sahl ibn Sa’d that is attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “There are two which will not be rejected: du`a at the time of the call (to prayer) and when it is raining.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud and classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami’, (3078). 
At a certain time of the night, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “During the night there is a time when the Muslim does not ask for the good of this world and the Hereafter but it will be given to him, and that happens every night.” (Narrated by Muslim, 757)
A certain time on Friday .  The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) mentioned Friday and said: “During it there is a time when a Muslim slave does not stand and pray and ask Allah for something, but He will give it to him,” and he gestured with his hand to indicate how short that time is. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 935; Muslim, 852. See also question no. 21748) 
When drinking Zamzam water . Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Zamzam water is for that for which it is drunk.” (Narrated by Ahmad and classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami’, 5502) 
When prostrating. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The closest that a person is to his Lord is when he is prostrating, so say a great deal of du`a then.” (Narrated by Muslim, 482)
When hearing the crowing of a rooster, because of the hadith: “When you hear the crowing of a rooster, ask Allah of His bounty, for he has seen an angel.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2304; Muslim, 2729) 
When saying the du`a, “La ilaha illa anta, subhanaka, inni kuntu min al-zalimin ([none has the right to be worshipped but You (O Allah)], Glorified (and Exalted) be You [above all that (evil) they associate with You]! Truly, I have been of the wrongdoers – cf al-Anbiya 21:87]).” It was narrated in a sahih hadith that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The prayer of Dhu’l-Nun (Yunus) which he said when he was in the belly of the whale: ‘La ilaha illa anta, subhanaka, inni kuntu min al-zalimin ([none has the right to be worshipped but You (O Allah)], Glorified (and Exalted) be You [above all that (evil) they associate with You]! Truly, I have been of the wrongdoers.’ No Muslim recites this du`a concerning any matter but Allah will answer him.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi and classed as sahih in Sahih al-Jami’, 3383.  

In his commentary on the passage (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And (remember) Dhun-Nun (Jonah), when he went off in anger, and imagined that We shall not punish him (i.e. the calamities which had befallen him)! But he cried through the darkness (saying): La ilaha illa Anta [none has the right to be worshipped but You (O Allah)], Glorified (and Exalted) be You [above all that (evil) they associate with You]! Truly, I have been of the wrongdoers.” So We answered his call, and delivered him from the distress. And thus We do deliver the believers (who believe in the Oneness of Allah, abstain from evil and work righteousness).” [al-Anbiya 21:87-88] 
Al-Qurtubi said:  In this verse, Allah stipulates that whoever calls upon Him, He will answer him as He answered and saved Dhu’l-Nun (Yunus). This is what is meant by the words “And thus We do deliver the believers”. (Al-Jami’ li Ahkam il-Quran, 11/334) 

 If a calamity befalls him and he says, Inna Lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji’un, Allahumma ujurni fi musibati w'ukhluf li khayran minha (Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return; O Allah, reward me in this calamity and compensate me with something better than it). It was narrated by Muslim in his Sahih (918) that Umm Salamah said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “There is no calamity that befalls one of the Muslims and he responds by saying ‘Inna Lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji'un, Allahumma ujurni fi musibati w'ukhluf li khayran minha (Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return; O Allah, reward me in this calamity and compensate me with something better than it),’ but Allah will compensate him with something better than it.” 
 The prayer of people after the soul of the deceased has been taken. According to the hadith, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) entered upon Abu Salamah (after he had died) and his eyes were open. He closed them and said: “When the soul is taken, the gaze follows it.” Some of his family got upset and he said: “Do not pray for anything but good for yourselves, for the angels say Amin to whatever you say.” Narrated by Muslim. 2732. 
Du`a for one who is sick. Muslim (919) narrated that Umm Salamah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When you visit a sick person, say good things, for the angels say Amin to whatever you say…” When Abu Salamah died, I came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: “Abu Salamah has died.” He said: “Say: O Allah, forgive me and him, and compensate me well.” She said: I said: And Allah compensated me with one who was better for me than him: Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
 The prayer of the one who has been wronged. In the hadith it says: “Fear the prayer of the one who has been wronged, for there is no barrier between it and Allah.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 469; Muslim, 19. And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The prayer of the one who has been wronged will be answered, even if he is an evildoer, for his evildoing is only against himself.” Narrated by Ahmad. See Sahih al-Jami’, 3382. 
 The du`a of a father for his child – i.e., for his benefit – and the du`a of a fasting person during the day of his fast, and the prayer of the traveller. It was narrated in a sahih report that our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There are three prayers that are not rejected: the prayer of a father for his child, the prayer of the fasting person and the prayer of the traveller.” Narrated by al-Bayhaqi; see Sahih al-Jami’, 2032; al-Sahihah, 1797. 
 The prayer of a father against his child – i.e., to harm him. According to a sahih hadith: ‘There are three prayers that will be answered: the prayer of one who has been wronged, the prayer of a traveller, and the prayer of a father against his child.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1905. See Sahih al-Adab al-Mufrad, 372. 
 The du`a of a righteous person for his parents, as stated in the hadith narrated by Muslim (1631): “When the son of Adam dies, all his good deeds come to an end except three: ongoing charity, a righteous son who will pray for him, or beneficial knowledge.” 
 Du`a after the sun has passed its zenith and before Zhuhr. ‘Abd-Allah ibn al-Saib (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to pray four rak'ahs after the sun had passed its zenith and before Zhuhr, and he said: “This is a time when the gates of heaven are opened and I want a good deed of mine to ascend during this time.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi and its isnad is sahih. See Takhrij al-Mishkaat, 1/337) 
 Du`a when getting up from the night (sleep), and saying the du`a that was narrated for that time. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever awakens from the night and says La ilaha ill-Allah wahdahu la sharika lah, lahu al-mulku wa lahu al-hamd, wa huwa 'ala kulli shay-in qadir. Alhamdulillah, wa Subhanallah, wa la ilaha illa Allah wallahu akbar wa la hawla wa la quwwata illa Billah (There is no god but Allah Alone, He has no partners, His is the Sovereignty, to Him belongs praise and He is over all things Capable. Glory be to Allah, there is no (true) God but Allah, and Allah is Most Great and there is no power and no strength except with Allah), then he says: Allahumma ighfir li (O Allah, forgive me), or he makes du`a, his prayer will be answered, and if he does wudu and prays, his prayer will be accepted.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1154.

22442,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22442,On acting; and the ruling on marrying young girls,"1)What is the ruling of islam acting in movies?.If it is allowed what type of filims must be them?.Also what is the role of women in movies ?.
2)Why islam allowed to marry children(girls) of age below 10 with out their permission(it is said that in the case of children,it requires the concern of their parents only.I also know it requires to get the permission in the case of adults).Actually marrage has to taken plce between the persons, who have even a little meturity.But in the case of children it not happend.Can you justify this ruling of islam(Child marrage ) ?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
The question of acting and related issues has already been dealt with in Question no. 10836. We may add to that: 
Shaykh Abu Bakr Zayd (may Allaah preserve him) said: chivalry [i.e., behaving in a proper and decent manner] is one of the aims of sharee’ah, and anything that undermines that renders a person unfit to give testimony in court. Islam enjoins the loftiest characteristics and forbids base and vile characteristics. How often do viewers see an actor doing silly actions or moving or speaking in a silly manner, or even playing the role of a madman, idiot or fool. Based on this, it is clear to the wise man that acting is one of the things that most undermine chivalry, so it is one of the things that render a person unfit to give testimony in court. Anything that is like that is not approved of in sharee’ah. 
See al-Muru’ah wa Khawaarimuhaa, p. 221, by Mashhoor Hasan 
Secondly: 
Marrying a young girl before she reaches the age of adolescence is permitted in sharee’ah; indeed it was narrated that there was scholarly consensus on this point. 
(a)Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And those of your women as have passed the age of monthly courses, for them the ‘Iddah (prescribed period), if you have doubt (about their periods), is three months; and for those who have no courses [(i.e. they are still immature) their ‘Iddah (prescribed period) is three months likewise”
[al-Talaaq 65:4]
In this verse we see that Allaah has made the ‘iddah in the case of divorce of a girl who does not have periods – because she is young and has not yet reached puberty – three months. This clearly indicates that Allaah has made this a valid marriage. 
(b)It was narrated from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) married her when she was six years old, he consummated the marriage with her when she was nine and she stayed with him for nine years.
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4840; Muslim, 1422) 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) married ‘Aa’ishah when she was six years old and consummated the marriage when she was nine.”
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim; Muslim says ‘seven years’) 
The fact that it is permissible to marry a young girl does not mean that it is permissible to have intercourse with her; rather that should not be done until she is able for it. For that reason the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) delayed the consummation of his marriage to ‘Aa’ishah. Al-Nawawi said: With regard to the wedding-party of a young married girl at the time of consummating the marriage, if the husband and the guardian of the girl agree upon something that will not cause harm to the young girl, then that may be done. If they disagree, then Ahmad and Abu ‘Ubayd say that once a girl reaches the age of nine then the marriage may be consummated even without her consent, but that does not apply in the case of who is younger. Maalik, al-Shaafa’i and Abu Haneefah said: the marriage may be consummated when the girl is able for intercourse, which varies from one girl to another, so no age limit can be set. This is the correct view. There is nothing in the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah to set an age limit, or to forbid that in the case of a girl who is able for it before the age of nine, or to allow it in the case of a girl who is not able for it and has reached the age of nine. Al-Dawoodi said: ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) was reached physical maturity (at the time when her marriage was consummated). 
Sharh Muslim, 9/206 
It is preferable for a guardian not to marry off his daughter when she is still young unless there is a valid reason for that. 
Al-Nawawi said: 
It should be noted that al-Shaafa’i and his companions said: It is preferable for fathers and grandfathers not to marry off a virgin until she reaches the age of puberty and they ask her permission, lest she end up in a marriage that she dislikes. What they said does not go against the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah, because what they meant is that they should not marry her off before she reaches puberty if there is no obvious interest to be served that they fear will be missed out on if they delay it, as in the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah. In that case it is preferable to go ahead with the marriage because the father is enjoined to take care of his child’s interests and not to let a good opportunity slip away.
 And Allaah knows best.

22445,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22445,Astrology vs. astronomy,Are we allowed to read our star signs?,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Al-Bukhaari said in his Saheeh: 
    Qutaadah said: “Allaah created these stars for three purposes: to adorn the 
    heavens, to stone the devils and as signs by which to navigate. Whoever 
    seeks anything else in them is mistaken and does not benefit from them, and 
    he is wasting his time and effort in seeking something of which he has no 
    knowledge.” (Saheeh al-Bukhaari, Baab fi’l-Nujoom, 2/240) 

    The study of the stars is divided into two 
    kinds: 

    1-    
    Study of the 
    influence of the stars (astrology)

    2-    
    Study of the 
    positions and movements of the stars (astronomy) 

    Study of the influence of the stars 
    (astrology) is divided into three categories: 

    1 – The belief that these stars have a real 
    influence in the sense that they create events and evil. This is major shirk 
    (shirk akbar), because whoever claims that there is another creator 
    alongside Allaah is a mushrik in the sense of major shirk, for he is 
    regarding a created thing that is subjugated as a creator which subjugates. 

    2 – Making this a reason to claim to have 
    knowledge of the unseen, so from the movements and changes in the stars he 
    deduces that such and such will happen because such and such has happened to 
    such and such a star. For example, he may say that one person’s life will be 
    miserable because he was born under this star, and that another person’s 
    life will be happy because he was born under that star. This person is 
    taking knowledge of the stars as a means to claim that he has knowledge of 
    the unseen, and claiming to have knowledge of the unseen is kufr (disbelief) 
    which puts one beyond the pale of Islam, because Allaah says (interpretation 
    of the meaning): 

    “Say: None in the heavens and the earth 
    knows the Ghayb (Unseen) except Allaah”[al-Naml 27:65] 

    The grammatical structure used in the 
    original Arabic – starting with the negation laa (translated here as 
    “none”) followed by the word illa (“except”) – is one of the most 
    emphatic ways of expressing exclusivity. So if a person claims to know the 
    unseen, he is effectively disbelieving what the Qur’aan says. 

    3 – If he believes that the stars are the 
    cause of good or bad things happening, this is minor shirk (shirk asghar), 
    i.e., when something happens he attributes it to the stars (and only 
    attributes it to the stars after it has happened). The basic principle is 
    that whoever believes that one thing is the cause of another when Allaah has 
    not made it so, is overstepping the mark and not acknowledging Allaah as He 
    should be acknowledged, because the One Who makes things happen is Allaah 
    alone. For example, if a person seeks healing from a piece of string (tied 
    around his wrist), and says, “I believe that healing is in the hand of 
    Allaah and this string is simply the means,” we would say to him, “You have 
    saved yourself from major shirk but you have fallen into lesser shirk, 
    because Allaah has not made string a clear means of healing. By doing this 
    you have transgressed against His position of Controller and Sustainer, by 
    making something a means to something else when Allaah has not made it so.” 
    The same applies to one who regards the stars as the cause of rainfall when 
    this is not the case. The evidence for that is the hadeeth narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari (801) and Muslim (104) from Zayd ibn Khaalid al-Juhani who said: 
    “The Messenger of Allaah SAWs (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    led us in praying Fajr at al-Hudaybiyah, following rainfall during the 
    night. When he had finished praying, he turned to the people and said, ‘Do 
    you know what your Lord has said?’ They said, ‘Allaah and His Messenger know 
    best.’ He said, ‘This morning one of My slaves became a believer in Me and 
    one became a disbeliever. As for the one who said, “We have been given rain 
    by virtue of Allaah and His mercy,” he is a believer in Me and a disbeliever 
    in the stars. But as for the one who said, “We have been given rain by such 
    and such a star,” he is a disbeliever in Me and a believer in the stars.’” 
    So the one who attributes rain to the stars is saying that the stars caused 
    the rain. 

    Study of the positions and movements of the 
    stars (astronomy) is divided into two categories: 

    1 – If their movements are used to define 
    things that serve a religious purpose, this is something that is necessary. 
    If that helps in the case of religious obligations, then learning it is 
    obligatory, such as using the stars to determine the direction of the qiblah 
    (direction of Makkah). 

    2 – If their movements are used to define 
    things that serve a worldly purpose, there is nothing wrong with that. This 
    is of two types: 

    (a) 
    Using the stars 
    to work out directions, such as knowing that the pole lies to the north, and 
    that the Pole Star, which is close to it, revolves around the North Pole. 
    This is permissible. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):

    “And landmarks (signposts, during the 
    day) and by the stars (during the night), they (mankind) guide themselves”

    [al-Nahl 16:16]

    (b) 
    Using the stars to 
    work out the seasons, through learning the phases of the moon. Some of the 
    salaf regarded this as makrooh while others permitted it. The correct view 
    is that it is permissible and there is nothing makrooh in it, because there 
    is no shirk involved in it, unless one learns it in order to attribute 
    rainfall or cold weather to it, and says that this is what is causing that. 
    That is a kind of shirk. But simply knowing the time of year from it, 
    whether it is spring or autumn or winter, there is nothing wrong with that.

    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    commanded the one who wants to get married to look for a religious woman. He 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:  “A woman may be 
    married for four things: her wealth, her lineage, her beauty or her 
    religious commitment. Look for the one who is religious, may your hands be 
    rubbed with dust (i.e., may you prosper).” 

    A wife is a life-long companion, and she will take care of 
    his household and all his affairs. She will be the one to bring up and teach 
    his children. Religious commitment is the thing that makes a woman chaste 
    and keeps her away from bad things. So you must choose a wife from among 
    those women who are religiously-committed and fear Allaah. 

    What I think you should do is to strive to influence her and 
    make da’wah to her through your family or some of your mahrams so that she 
    will improve and adhere to the straight path. If she adheres to the straight 
    path and improves, then marry her. 

    Otherwise, I think that you should look for someone else, for 
    you have no guarantee that you will be able to influence her; she may not 
    respond, or you may be influenced by her, for no matter how much faith and 
    taqwa (piety) a person may have, he is still human and is still subject to

    Your question includes a number of serious issues, not just 
    one problem.  The details are as follows: 

    1 – The neglect of prayer on the part of your friend and your 
    relative, who claim to be Muslims. This action is kufr. See Question no.
    5208 and 2182. 
    Indeed, you say that they do not practise Islam, and this is disaster upon 
    disaster, kufr upon kufr. We seek refuge with Allaah from that. 

    2 – Falling into zina (fornication, adultery), which is 
    forbidden in Islam, as is well known. It is forbidden even in the other 
    divinely-revealed religions. 

    3 – Marrying an adulteress when she is pregnant as a result 
    of zina. 

    4 – The adulterer seeking to marry an adulteress after she 
    has gotten married to someone else. 

    Which disaster should we begin with? Which question should we 
    answer? Laa hawla wa laa quwwata illa Billaah (there is no power and 
    no strength except with Allaah). 

    Let us start with the most serious: 
1 – Kufr as a result of 
    not praying and neglecting all the rituals of Islam. 

    There is no doubt that kufr (disbelief) dooms one to enter 
    Hell, Allaah says describing the mushrikeen and how they will answer 
    concerning the reason why they entered Hell: 
“They will say: ‘We were 
    not of those who used to offer the Salaah (prayers), 

    Nor we used to feed Al‑Miskeen (the poor);

    And we used to talk falsehood (all that which Allaah 
    hated) with vain talkers.

    And we used to belie the Day of Recompense, 
    

    Until there came to us (the death) that is certain’”

    [al-Muddaththir 74:43-47 – interpretation of the meaning]

    Ibn Katheer said, commenting on this passage: 

    “ ‘We were not of those who used to offer the Salaah 
    (prayers)’ means ,we did not worship our Lord. 

    ‘Nor we used to feed Al‑Miskeen (the 
    poor)’ means, we did not show any kindness to His 
    creation of our own kind (our fellow human beings). 

    ‘And we used to talk falsehood (all that which Allaah 
    hated) with vain talkers’ means, we used to speak of that of which we 
    had no knowledge. Qutaadah said: (it means), everyone who went astray, we 
    followed him. 

    ‘And we used to belie the Day of Recompense’. Ibn 
    Jareer said: we used to deny the Day of Recompense, of reward and 
    punishment; we did not believe in reward, punishment or reckoning. 

    ‘Until there came to us (the death) that is certain’ 
    means death, as in the aayah, ‘And worship your 
    Lord until there comes unto you the certainty (i.e. death)’ [al-Hijr 15:99].” 

    But what you have to do is to advise them, establish proof 
    against them and explain to them that what they are doing is destroying the 
    most important pillar of Islam, so they must hasten to repent from 
    neglecting the prayer and all the rituals of Islam. It is not permissible 
    for you to turn a blind eye to one who neglects prayer under any 
    circumstances. Start by advising and guiding him, then shun him and turn 
    away from him, do not greet him, eat his food or sit with him, if that will 
    do him some good. Make him aware of how great his sin is, so that perhaps he 
    will turn back to his Lord and repent.  

    2 – Falling into zina (adultery) is a major sin. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And come not near to unlawful sex. Verily, it is a 
    Faahishah (i.e. anything that transgresses its limits: a great sin, and an 
    evil way that leads one to hell unless Allaah Forgives him)”

    [al-Isra’ 15:32]

    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said, “An adulterer, at the time he is committing illegal sexual intercourse 
    is not a believer; and a drinker, at the time he imbibes an alcoholic drink 
    is not a believer; and a thief, at the time of stealing, is not a believer. 
    And a robber  who robs (takes illegally something by force) while the people 
    are looking at him, is not a believer at the time he is robbing (taking).” 
    (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, no. 2475). 

    It is a major sin, and the one who commits this sin is issued 
    with a warning of a painful torment. It says in the great hadeeth about the 
    Mi’raaj (Prophet’s ascent to the heavens): “… We went on, and we came to 
    something like a Tannoor (a kind of baking oven, a pit usually clay-lined 
    for baking bread).” I [the narrator] think he said, “In that oven there was 
    much noise and voices.” He said, “We looked into it and found naked men and 
    women, and a flame of fire was reaching up to them from underneath, and when 
    it reached them, they cried loudly. I asked them [the two angels], ‘Who are 
    these people?’… 

    They [the two angels] said, ‘We will tell you… those naked 
    men and women whom you saw in a structure resembling an oven, they are the 
    adulterers and the adulteresses.”

    (Narrated by al-Bukhaari in Baab Ithm al-Zunaah, no. 
    7047). 

    Please see also Question no. 11195. 

    3 – With regard to the third question, which concerns 
    marrying an adulteress when she is pregnant, it should be noted that “it is 
    not permissible to marry an adulteress until she repents, and if a man wants 
    to marry her, he must wait to make sure that she is not pregnant, which is 
    shown by her having a menstrual period, before he can marry her. If it 
    becomes apparent that she is pregnant, then it is not permissible for him to 
    marry her until she has given birth…” (Fatwa of Shaykh Muhammad ibn 
    Ibraaheem – may Allaah have mercy on him. See al-Fataawa al-Jaami’ah 
    li’l-Mar’ah al-Muslimah, 2/584) 
Based on that, marriage 
    to this woman when she is pregnant from an adulterer is an invalid marriage, 
    and the person who married her has to leave her at once, otherwise he is an 
    adulterer and the hadd punishment for adultery must be carried out on him. 

    But if he leaves her and she gives birth, and her womb 
    becomes empty, and she repents sincerely, then it will be permissible for 
    him to marry her, after he also repents. 

    4 – As for the first man – the adulterer – he must also 
    repent to Allaah, and it is not permissible for him to marry her at all, for 
    two reasons: 

    (i)because they are bother 
    adulterers, and marriage to adulterers is forbidden to believers. See 
    Question no. 11195.

    (ii)Because of her relationship 
    with another man.

    So he has to forget about her completely, and repent to 
    Allaah from his serious sin. Laa hawla wa laa quwwata illa Billaah al-‘Aliy

22449,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22449,There is nothing wrong with paying the zakah on trade goods in goods themselves,"I have a store selling foodstuffs with stock that is worth approximately fifty thousand dinars, and I have a debt of twenty thousand dinars. The zakah on the store is due now. How can I pay it when I have only a little money in the store?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
The scholars differed concerning one who has the minimum amount of wealth at which zakah becomes due (the nisaab) and owes a debt – does he have to pay zakah on the amount of the debt or not? 
The most correct of the scholarly views is that the debt does not rule out the obligation to pay zakah. Based on this, you should estimate the value of the goods that you have in the store at the end of one year, then pay zakah on the whole amount without subtracting the amount of the debt that you owe. 
Please see question no. (22426) 
Secondly: 
With regard to paying zakah when you do not have any cash, the most correct scholarly view concerning the zakah on trade goods is that it may be given in the form of goods. 
Based on this, if you do not have cash, then you should pay zakah in the form of products that you have in the store, and that will be sufficient, in sha Allah. It is not permissible for you to delay zakah after it becomes due. See also question no. 13981. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
It is permissible to pay the zakah on trade goods in the form of goods. 
Al-Ikhtiyaaraat, p. 101 
Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Is it permissible to pay zakah in the form of fabric? 
He replied: 
That is permissible according to the more sound of the two scholarly opinions. You should pay zakah on high-quality goods in the form of high-quality goods, and for low-quality goods in the form of low-quality goods, because zakah is a kind of aid given from the rich to the poor. So it is permissible to help them by giving them fabric, just as the zakah on grains, dates and zakatable animals may be given in the form of those things themselves.

I have recently received a marriage proposal and have prayed Salat-ul-istikhara, however I never seem to receive any clear signs or indications about what to do.  This has happened to me in many situations and the same is happening now too.  I am a practising Muslim but obviously have flaws as all of us do have.  I have a thirst for knowledge of the deen and am currently working on myself as a Muslims and acquiring sacred knowledge at the same time.  What I look and hope for in a partner is a role model who is beyond me and someone who can help me in becoming a better person.  Someone who loves and lives for Allah swt and who I can turn to for knowledge and who will be a good companion for me.  The current proposal has many good qualities, except a few things that are concerning me.  Firstly we are on a slightly different level of speaking, ie. Although he is a graduate he is not extremely intellectually spoken (I suppose this is something I should overlook).  Secondly he has been practising for less time than me and therefore I feel he has less knowledge than me, which I find an of put as I feel he should be my guide not vice versa.  However he does have a thirst for knowledge and does study the deen and also wishes to take out a year or so to go abroad and study the deen (which is what I also want to do).  Apart from these two issues I feel we are compatible in many other ways.  We have the same vision in life.  Whilst paying Salat-ul-Istikhara I am getting no clear sign, except at times I get a tight feeling in my heart at times, which puts me off, but then I also think I should go for this as he has many good qualities.  Im not sure as to what to do and am really confused, I dont know what this feeling in my heart means.  I have met him once and there will be another meeting this Friday, but I dont want to lag it on any longer than necessary as it is playing with peoples emotions.  Please get back to me with a reply soon as I really need some advice, especially regarding my Istikhaara as it is confusing me.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The basic principle is that if a woman receives a marriage 
    proposal from a man whose religious commitment, attitude and trustworthiness 
    are satisfactory, then she should accept, so long as there is not another 
    offer from one whose attitude and religious commitment are better. So if the 
    one who has proposed marriage to you meets these criteria, and he is keen to 
    learn more about Islam as you say, then this is a good sign. But if the 
    shortcomings to which you refer in your question are major sins or sins in 
    which he is persisting or committing openly, then we advise you to wait for 
    someone better, so long as there is no risk of you doing something haraam or 
    exposing yourself to greater fitnah (temptation).
    Secondly: 

    It is not necessary in the case of istikhaarah to feel 
    something specific afterwards. Rather if you consult people and think deeply 
    about the matter, and it becomes clear to you that this matter will be 
    beneficial both in religious and worldly terms, then you should pray 
    istikhaarah and go ahead, and not wait for a sign or a dream or a feeling. 
    You should rather put your trust in Allaah and go ahead after praying 
    istikhaarah. You will find a detailed answer concerning istikhaarah and its 
    rulings in Question no. 5882. 

    Thirdly: 

    Beware of being alone or of uncovering in front of this man 
    who is still a non-mahram to you. In the answer to question no.
    12182 you will find a detailed answer to your 
    question regarding marriage proposals and sitting with and meeting the one 
    who has proposed marriage to you. Please refer to this question. 

    Fourthly: 

    Your wish concerning what you hope to find in a husband, 
    meaning that he lives for the sake of Allaah, is a great wish, and we hope 
    that Allaah will grant you that. But you should know that a righteous woman 
    is one of the greatest means that will help a man in this regard, by helping 
    him and advising him, and encouraging him to do more, and patiently putting 
    up with anything that affects her rights because of his being involved in 
    doing righteous deeds.

22457,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22457,Specifying a number of times to recite dhikr or du’aa’ that is not narrated in sharee’ah,"What are the basis of using such du'a as Ya lADIFU 29 TIMES Ya Qahharu 306 times, Hasbunallahu wa ni'imal wakeel 450 times e.t.c,how right or how wrong is it to use them because i didn't find any verse of the Quran or Hadith that supports their use.",,,"Praise be to Allah.There is no sound (saheeh) basis for reciting these adhkaar the number of times mentioned in the question. These numbers are usually stated by some of the innovators, most of whom are Sufis, who describe adhkaar and the number of times they are to be repeated, making that up themselves; they say whoever recites such and such will get such and such benefits and protection, and whoever recites such and such a wird will get such and such a reward. 
Of course, these are matters which can only be known through wahy (revelation). So the basic principle in this case is that dhikr and du`as are of two types: 
1 – Adhkaar which were narrated in the Quran and Sunnah, to be recited at a certain time, in a certain place or in certain circumstances. This type should be recited as prescribed, at the appropriate time, or in the appropriate circumstances or place, with the correct words or posture, without adding anything or taking anything away. 
2 – All dhikr or du`a in general that is not connected to certain times or places.  These fall into two categories: 
(i)                Those which were narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), so they should be recited in the wording that he used. They should not be connected to any particular time or place, and they should not be connected to a specific number of times to be recited.
(ii)              Those which were not narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), rather the person makes them up himself, or they were narrated from the salaf. It is permissible to say such words so long as five conditions are met:
1-      He should choose the best and clearest words, for he is conversing with his Lord and God.
2-      The words should be of an appropriate style.
3-      The du`a should be free of anything that is forbidden in Islam, e.g. it should not involve any element of seeking help from anything other than Allah, and so on.
4-      It should be of the general kind of dhikr and du`a, not connected to a particular time, place or circumstances.
5-      It should not be taken as a regular practice. 
Adapted from Tasheeh al-du`a by Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd (p. 42) 
Based on the above, the words mentioned in the question are phrases that are narrated in the Quran and Sunnah, but saying that they must be repeated this number of times is an innovated matter which should not be followed. Rather we should mention them during our du`as and address Allah by all His beautiful names, without singling out some names or stating that they should be recited a certain number of times or at certain times, making that up ourselves. We should adhere to what was narrated in sharee’ah concerning certain times, places or situations connected to a particular du`a; if no such details were narrated in sharee’ah then we should not make them up ourselves because that is encroaching upon the rights of Prophethood.

22466,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22466,The reason why it is prescribed for Muslims to perform Hajj once in a lifetime,Why should Muslims atleast visit mecca once in their life time?,,,"Praise be to Allah.We Muslims feel honoured and proud to be the slaves of Allah, the One, the Self-Sufficient Master, Who begets not nor was He begotten, and there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him; He is our Lord and we have no Lord besides Him. Hence we respond to the commands of our Lord with the utmost humility and submit to His commands, for we know that He is the All-Wise and no wisdom is greater than His. We know that He is the Most-Merciful and there is none more merciful than Him, may He be glorified and praised. Hence we love Him in a way that demands that we obey His commands even if that is somewhat difficult for us. We feel proud, happy and content when we do that which He commands us to do. 
For if a human loves another person, he loves to serve him and that may make him happy. So what do you think about the Almighty Lord Who created us and grants us provision, and everything that we have is a blessing from Him? And His is the highest description. We owe everything to our Lord, so we must hasten to do all that He commands us to do, so that we might give back some small thanks for His great blessings. We can never thank Him enough, but by His grace Allah the Most Generous accepts our small efforts and rewards us for them greatly. 
For example, Hajj or pilgrimage. If a Muslim does Hajj in the manner required by his Lord, then Allah has promised to forgive him his sins and admit him to Paradise, on condition that he does not spoil this action by committing any major action that would invalidate it and earn the anger of Allah. 
One of the great mercies that Allah has bestowed upon this ummah (nation, i.e., the Muslims), is that Allah has made obedience to His commands and the commands of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) subject to the condition that one be able to do them. So long as a person is able to do them, then it is obligatory for him to do what is required of him, otherwise he is not obliged to do so and he is excused. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope”
[al-Baqarah 2:286] – i.e., He does not ask him to do more than he can bear. 
Concerning Hajj in particular, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah) to the House (Ka‘bah) is a duty that mankind owes to Allah, those who can afford the expenses (for one’s conveyance, provision and residence)” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:97]
By His mercy He has enjoined this upon His slaves once in a lifetime, so that it will not be too difficult for them, but He urges those who are able to do Hajj and ‘Umrah more than once to do so. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Keep on doing Hajj and ‘Umrah, for they take away poverty and sins as the bellows takes away the impurity from iron.” (Narrated by al-Nasaa’i, 2/4; this is a saheeh hadeeth as was stated by al-Albaani in al-Silsilat al-Saheehah, 1200). 
This great act of worship was prescribed by Allah so that we might praise Him and glorify Him, and thank Him for His great blessings and bounty. The purpose of Tawaaf around the Ka’bah is not simply to go around these stones! No, rather the reason is that Allah has commanded us to go around it seven times and we obey Allah by going around it seven times, no more and no less; rather we do what He has commanded us and we feel that we are His slaves, humbling ourselves before Him and praising Him and thanking Him for choosing us to be His slaves out of all of mankind who worship various gods, and may even worship themselves or their own desires. 
The same applies to all the rituals of Hajj, and indeed to all the acts of worship that Allah has prescribed for us. Praise be to Allah, Who has honoured us with this great religion. 
Moreover, your interest in asking about the Hajj at your young age indicates that you are keen to learn and find out. We advise you to learn more about Islam and to read about it, and to find out for yourself that it is the religion that suits the natural inclinations of man. This will set you on the path towards pleasing your Almighty Lord, Who created you and Who provides for you, and Who deserves that you should worship Him alone and none other. 
Perhaps you know that our prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told us that his fellow-Prophet ‘Eesa (Jesus – peace be upon him) will come down at the end of time and will perform pilgrimage to this House, and he will declare his belief in Allah alone (Tawheed). We believe that this will happen as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told us, just as we believe that the sun rises in the morning. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “By the One in Whose hand is my soul, the son of Maryam (the son of Mary, i.e. Jesus) will certainly pronounce the Talbiyah for Hajj or for ‘Umrah, or for both  in the valley of Rawha.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1252). The valley of Rawha’ is a place between Makkah and Madeenah. 
[Translator’s note: The Talbiyah is a prayer recited by pilgrims going to Makkah. It may be translated as follows: “Here I am at your service, O Allah, here I am. Here I am at Your Service, You have no partner, here I am. All praise and blessings are Yours, and all dominion. You have no partner.”]

22467,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22467,Purification of the sinners,"I've heard that, after the judgement day the moslem, excluded the syahid and moslem who were guaranted by Allah to go to heaven, before they go to the heaven they would be cleaned. I mean, they would go to hell first then after they have been cleaned up they would go to heaven.Is it true?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
Perhaps the questioner is referring to the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“There is not one of you but will pass over it (Hell); this is with your Lord, a Decree which must be accomplished.
Then We shall save those who use to fear Allah and were dutiful to Him. And We shall leave the Zaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers) therein (humbled) to their knees (in Hell)” [Maryam 19:71-72]
This is addressed to all of mankind, righteous and immoral, believers and kaafirs, stating that there is not any one among them who will not pass over Hell, a decree which Allah has issued and of which He has warned His slaves. So it must inevitably come to pass, and there is no avoiding it.  
The scholars differed as to the meaning of this passing over. Some said that it means that Hell will be brought close to all creatures, until it terrifies all of them, then Allah will save those who fear Him. 
Some said that it means that all will enter it, but it will be coolness and safety for the believers. 
Some said that it means crossing the siraat which is a bridge over Hell. The people will cross it according to their deeds: some will cross it in the twinkling of an eye, some like the wind, some like swift horses; some will pass quickly, some will walk, some will crawl and some will be snatched  and thrown into the Fire, all according to their level of fear of Allah. Hence Allah says “Then We shall save those who used to fear Allah and were dutiful to Him” i.e., by doing what He commanded and avoiding what He forbade; “And We shall leave the Zaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers)” i.e., those who wronged themselves by disbelieving and committing sin, “therein (humbled) to their knees (in Hell)” – this is because of the wrongdoing and kufr, so they will deserve to abide therein forever and there will be no way out for them.""(Tafseer Ibn Sa’di, p. 811) 
Secondly: 
It is essential for those who will be admitted to Paradise to be cleansed of all their sins before they enter it. The sinners’ cleansing of their sins may happen in this world or in the Hereafter. In this world, Allah has given His slaves ways of cleansing themselves thereof, by following their sins and evil deeds with prayers for forgiveness, sincere repentance and good deeds that erase sin. We have already discussed this matter in the answer to question no. 13693. 
With regard to the purification of the sinners in the Hereafter, this will be achieved in several ways: 
1 – Prayers of the believers for the (deceased) believer, such as their offering the funeral prayer for him. It was narrated from ‘Aa’ishah and Anas ibn Maalik that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no deceased person for whom a group of Muslims numbering one hundred offer the funeral prayer, all of them interceding for him, but their intercession for him will be accepted.” Narrated by Muslim, 947. 
It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “There is no Muslim man who dies and forty men who do not associate anything in worship with Allah stand and pray for him, but Allah will accept their intercession for him.” Narrated by Muslim, 948. 
So it is known that this du’aa’ is one of the means of the deceased being forgiven. 
2 – Acts of ongoing charity that the person did during his life will benefit him after his death. 
3 – Good deeds done on behalf of the deceased, such as charity, Hajj, etc. These will benefit him, according to the texts of the saheeh Sunnah. It was proven in al-Saheehayn that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever dies owing fasts, let his heir fast on his behalf.” And it was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When a man dies all his good deeds come to an end except three: ongoing charity, beneficial knowledge and a righteous child who will pray for him.” Narrated by Muslim, 1638. 
4 – What happens in the grave of the trial, squeezing and terror. These are things that expiate for sins. 
5 – The intercession of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and others for sinners on the Day of Resurrection, as is narrated in mutawaatir reports in the ahaadeeth about intercession, such as the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the saheeh hadeeth, “My intercession will be for those among my ummah who committed major sins,” and “I was given the choice between admitting half of my ummah to Paradise and intercession, and I chose intercession because it is more general and greater. Do you think it will be only for the pious? No, it will be for the sinners who contaminated themselves with sins.” Narrated by Ibn Maajah 4311; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah, 3480. 
6 – The terrors, difficulties and hardships of the Day of Resurrection.  
7 – The mercy and forgiveness of Allah bestowed with no action on the part of His slaves. It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “Allah created mercy on the day that He created it, and divided it into one hundred parts. He kept ninety-nine parts and sent one to all of His creation. If the kaafir knew of all that is with Allah of mercy, he would never despair of Paradise, and if the believer knew of all that is with Allah of punishment he would never feel safe from Hell.”
Narrated by al-Bukhari, 6469. 
And the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah will draw the believer close and screen him and will say, ‘Do you admit such and such sin, do you admit such and such sin?’ and he will say, ‘Yes, O Lord.’ Then when he has admitted his sins and thinks that he is doomed, [Allah] will say, ‘I concealed them for you in the world and I forgive you for them this Day.’ Then he will be given the book of his good deeds. But as for the kaafir and the hypocrite, “the witnesses will say, “These are the ones who lied against their Lord!” No doubt! the Curse of Allah is on the Zaalimoon (polytheists, wrongdoers, oppressors)’ [Hood 11:18 – interpretation of the meaning]”
Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2441. 
8 – It is proven in al-Saheehayn that when the believers have crossed al-Siraat, they will be detained on a bridge between Paradise and Hell, where they will settle their scores with one another. Then when they have been cleansed and purified, they will be given permission to enter Paradise. It was narrated that Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When the believers have been saved from the Fire, then they will be detained on the bridge between Paradise and Hell. There they will settle the scores between them for any wrongs that they did to one another in this world, and when they have been cleansed and purified, they will be given permission to enter Paradise. By the One in Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, each of them will recognize his dwelling in Paradise better than he recognizes his dwelling in this world.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 6535. 
Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“When the believers have been saved from the Fire” means when they have been saved from falling into it after they have crossed al-siraat. 
Al-Qurtubi said: These believers are the ones whom Allah knows that settling scores will not use up all of their good deeds. 
I (al-Haafiz) say: Perhaps the people of al-A’raaf are among them, according to the more correct opinion referred to above. Excluded from this are two groups of believers: those who will enter Paradise without being brought to account, and those who are doomed by their deeds. 
“they will be detained on the bridge between Paradise and Hell” – al-siraat is a bridge placed across Hell, and Paradise lies beyond that. So the people will pass across it according to their deeds. Among them will be those who are saved, who are the ones whose good deeds outweigh their bad deeds, or they are equal, or Allah has forgiven them. Some of them will fall into Hell, and they are the ones whose bad deeds outweigh their good deeds, except for those whom Allah forgives. Those believers in Tawheed who fall will be punished for as long as Allah wills, then they will be brought out by intercession and other means. The ones who are saved may have some scores which others need to settle with him, but they have good deeds that equal that or outweigh it, so some of their good deeds equivalent to those scores that need to be settled, and thus is will becomes free of responsibility.  
“and when they are cleansed and purified” means cleansed and freed of all responsibilities. End quote. 
If the Muslim who believed in Allah alone but committed sins is not cleansed for some reason, then he will enter Hell so that he may be purified completely therein, but he will not abide therein forever, rather he will be brought forth by the intercession of those who intercede and by the mercy of the Most Merciful of those who show mercy. 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
With regard to the sinners, such as those who kill unlawfully, those who disobey their parents, those who consume riba, and those who drink alcohol – if they die in those sins and they are Muslims, they and others like them will be subject to the will of Allah, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“but He forgives whom He pleases sins other than that” [al-Nisa’ 4:116]
 So if He wills He will forgive them because of the righteous deeds with which they died, which is their belief in Him alone (Tawheed) and their sincerity towards Allah, and their being Muslims, or the intercession of those who intercede for them, as well as their Tawheed and sincerity. 
Or He may punish them without forgiving them, so they are punished by being admitted to Hell and tormented therein, to a degree commensurate with their sins, then they will be brought forth, as is stated in mutawaatir ahaadeeth narrated from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), which say that he will intercede for the sinners among his ummah, and that Allah will give him a certain number of people a number of times, so he will intercede and bring forth a group by Allah’s leave, then he will intercede again, and again and again, so he will (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) will intercede four times. And the angels and the believers will also intercede, as will al-afraat (the children who died before they reached the age of puberty). All of them will intercede and Allah will bring forth whomever He wills from Hell through their intercession.  Then there will be some of the sinners from among the believers in Tawheed and Islam left in Hell. Then the Lord will bring them forth by His grace and mercy, without intercession on anyone’s part, and there will be no one left in Hell except those whom the Qur’aan rules will abide therein forever, namely the kuffaar.""(Majmoo’ Fatawa wa Maqaalaat Ibn Baz, 9/380). 
It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “… until when Allah has finished passing judgement amongst His slaves, and He wants to bring forth from Hell those whom He wants of those who used to testify that there is no god except Allah, He will command the angels to bring them forth and they will know them by the traces of the mark of sujood. Allah will forbid the Fire to consume the mark of sujood on the sons of Adam. So they will bring them forth and they will have been burned, then water that is called the water of life will be poured on them, and they will grow like seeds growing after a flood recedes.” 
Narrated by al-Bukhari, 6574; Muslim, 172. 
It was narrated that Abu Sa’eed said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “As for the people of Hell who belong there, they will neither die nor live therein, but people who entered Hell because of their sins, they will die once, then when they have become like coals, permission will be given for intercession, so they will be brought forth group after group and scattered on the rivers of Paradise, then it will be said, ‘O people of Paradise be generous to them, then they will grow like seeds growing after a flood recedes.”

22468,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22468,Ruling on marrying an atheist,"When i got married,my husbnd told me before marriage that he was an atheist.I didnt think too much of it as my faith was also on shaky grounds.And i thought maybe i could change him(his parents are muslims).  

Then the year after marriage saw me not believing in Allah at all and sometimes believing in him,but my Imaan was not very strong. 

 Then i started having problems with his parents,and my parents advised me to trust Allah and pray to Him.Alhamdu lillahh I started praying,cos maybe somewhere deep inside me I knew Allah exists. 

 My uncle passed away recently,he was only 25.This made me realise how unpredictable our lives are and have Alhamdulillah become a firm believer. 
 But my husband beliefs are not like mine.Though he believes there is Allah and Prophet Muhammad()is his messanger,he doesnt think it important to live by what he has taught us.He says it is for the people of that time.  

My qn is..is our marriage void.  

If it is how do I make him understand,as he says that the important thing is our hearts should be clean.It doesnt matter if we drink or gamble or do anything.Incidentally he drinks.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    encouraged us to marry those who are religiously-committed, because 
    basically women are weak and may change their beliefs and thoughts and even 
    their religion for the slightest reason. So you should not have even 
    considered marrying one whose religious commitment was not great, let alone 
    marrying one who has no religious commitment at all, on the grounds that you 
    would be able to guide him. 

    Marriage to an atheist is invalid and the marriage contract 
    is basically null and void. It is not permissible for a woman who believes 
    in Allaah and the Last Day to enter into such an invalid marriage on the 
    grounds that this man may possibly be guided after marriage. She should have 
    done what the great Sahaabi woman Umm Sulaym did when she refused to marry 
    Abu Talhah – who was a kaafir at the time – unless he became Muslim, and he 
    did so. This was the greatest mahr (dowry) in Islam as Anas (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) said. (al-Nasaa’i, 3341; classed as saheeh by 
    al-Albaani). 

    The evidence that the marriage of a Muslim woman to a kaafir 
    man is invalid is very clear. This is one of the matters on which there is 
    unanimous agreement among all the scholars of the ummah. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! When 
    believing women come to you as emigrants, examine them; Allaah knows best as 
    to their Faith, then if you ascertain that they are true believers send them 
    not back to the disbelievers. They are not lawful (wives) for the 
    disbelievers nor are the disbelievers lawful (husbands) for them. But give 
    them (disbelievers) that (amount of money) which they have spent (as their 
    Mahr) to them. And there will be no sin on you to marry them if you have 
    paid their Mahr to them. Likewise hold not the disbelieving women as wives…”

    [al-Mumtahanah 60:10]

    “And do not marry Al-Mushrikaat (idolatresses) till they 
    believe (worship Allaah Alone). And indeed a slave woman who believes is 
    better than a (free) Mushrikah (idolatress), even though she pleases you. 
    And give not (your daughters) in marriage to Al‑Mushrikoon till they believe 
    (in Allaah Alone) and verily, a believing slave is better than a (free) 
    Mushrik (idolater), even though he pleases you. Those (Al-Mushrikoon) invite 
    you to the Fire, but Allaah invites (you) to Paradise and forgiveness by His 
    Leave, and makes His Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, 
    revelations, etc.) clear to mankind that they may remember”

    [al-Baqarah 2:221]

    What your husband says and attributes to Islam is definitely 
    false. Islam is not only for the time when the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) was sent, rather he  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) was sent to all of mankind until the Hour 
    begins. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And We have not sent you (O Muhammad) except as a giver 
    of glad tidings and a warner to all mankind, but most of men know not”

    [Saba’ 34:28] 

    “Say (O Muhammad): “O mankind! Verily, I am sent to you 
    all as the Messenger of Allaah — to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens 
    and the earth. Laa ilaaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but 
    He). It is He Who gives life and causes death. So believe in Allaah and His 
    Messenger (Muhammad), the Prophet who can neither read nor write (i.e. 
    Muhammad), who believes in Allaah and His Words [(this Qur’aan), the Tawraat 
    (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel) and also Allaah’s Word: “Be!” — and he was, 
    i.e. ‘Eesa (Jesus) son of Maryam (Mary)], and follow him so that you may be 
    guided”

    [al-A’raaf 7:158]
It was narrated that 
    Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger 
    of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “I have 
    been given five things which were not given to any of the Prophets before 
    me: I have been supported with fear to a distance of a month’s travelling; 
    the earth has been made a place of prostration and a means of purification 
    for me, so that wherever a man of my ummah is when the time for prayer 
    comes, he may pray; war booty has been made permissible for me; the 
    (previous) Prophets were sent only to their own people but I have been sent 
    to all of mankind; and I have been given the power of intercession.” 
    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 438; Muslim, 432. 

    Your husband’s belief that “the important thing is our hearts 
    should be clean. It doesn’t matter if we drink or gamble” is a false notion. 
    If the heart is clean and pure then the effects of that should be seen in a 
    person’s outward actions. Outward righteousness is a sign of inward 
    righteousness, and outward corruption is a sign of inward corruption. How 
    can his heart be clean if he drinks alcohol or gambles or commits immoral 
    actions? This is impossible. 

    It was narrated that al-Nu’maan ibn Basheer said: I heard the 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: 
    “What is permitted is obvious and what is forbidden is obvious, and between 
    them are doubtful matters about which not many people know. Thus he who 
    avoids doubtful matters clears himself with regard to his religious 
    commitment and his honour, but he who falls into doubtful matters falls into 
    that which is forbidden, like a shepherd who pastures around a sanctuary, 
    all but grazing therein. Truly every king has a sanctuary and Allaah’s 
    sanctuary is His prohibitions. And in the body there is a piece of flesh 
    which, if it be whole, all the body is whole, and if it is diseased, all the 
    body is diseased: it is the heart.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 52; Muslim, 
    1599. 

    Conclusion: This marriage of yours is invalid and it is not 
    permissible to allow him to be intimate with you unless he comes back to 
    Islam and enters the faith by pronouncing the Shahaadatayn and following the 
    rulings of Islam. If he does not do that then the marriage must be annulled 
    in a sharee’ah court. If you cannot do that or if there is no sharee’ah 
    court where you live, then you should ask him for a divorce. If he refuses 
    then you should divorce him by means of khula’, returning his mahr or more 
    or less so that you can be separated.

22471,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22471,Repetition and word order in the Qur’aan And commentary on the phrase “And fear a Day (of Judgement) when a person shall not avail another”,"In Soorat al-Baqarah we see that Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O Children of Israel! Remember My Favour which I bestowed upon you and that I preferred you to the ‘Aalameen [mankind and jinn (of your time period, in the past)].
 And fear a Day (of Judgement) when a person shall not avail another, nor will intercession be accepted from him nor will compensation be taken from him nor will they be helped
[al-Baqarah 2:47-48] 
Then later on He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O Children of Israel! Remember My Favour which I bestowed upon you and that I preferred you to the ‘Aalameen [mankind and jinn (of your time period, in the past)].
And fear the Day (of Judgement) when no person shall avail another, nor shall compensation be accepted from him, nor shall intercession be of use to him, nor shall they be helped”
[al-Baqarah 2:122-123] 
and we see that the words intercession (shafaa’ah) and compensation (‘adl) are reversed, even thought both passages are speaking of the Children of Israel.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The answer to this question includes a number of points: 
1 – The Tafseer (commentary) on the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
 And fear a Day (of Judgement) when a person shall not avail another, nor will intercession be accepted from him nor will compensation be taken from him nor will they be helped
[al-Baqarah 2:48]
and the similar verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And fear the Day (of Judgement) when no person shall avail another, nor shall compensation be accepted from him, nor shall intercession be of use to him, nor shall they be helped”
[al-Baqarah 2:123]
Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said (1/256): 
Because Allaah reminds them of His blessing first – i.e., in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “O Children of Israel! Remember My Favour which I bestowed upon you, and fulfil (your obligations to) My Covenant (with you) so that I fulfil (My Obligations to) your covenant (with Me), and fear none but Me” [al-Baqarah 2:40] – He then followed that with a warning of His wrath on the Day of Resurrection, and said: “And fear a Day” meaning, fear the Day of Resurrection, “when a person shall not avail another” meaning, no person will be able to help another, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And no bearer of burdens shall bear another’s burden”
[Faatir 35:18] 
“Every man that Day will have enough to make him careless of others”
[‘Abasa 80:37] 
“O mankind! Be afraid of your Lord (by keeping your duty to Him and avoiding all evil), and fear a Day when no father can avail aught for his son, nor a son avail aught for his father”
[Luqmaan 31:33]
This is a most eloquent statement that neither father nor son will be able to do anything for the other. 
The phrase “nor will intercession be accepted from him” means, from the kaafirs, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So no intercession of intercessors will be of any use to them”
[al-Muddaththir 74:48]
The phrase “nor will compensation be taken from him” means, no ransom will be accepted from him, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, those who disbelieved, and died while they were disbelievers, the (whole) earth full of gold will not be accepted from anyone of them even if they offered it as a ransom”
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:91] 
“Verily, those who disbelieve, if they had all that is in the earth, and as much again therewith to ransom themselves thereby from the torment on the Day of Resurrection, it would never be accepted of them, and theirs would be a painful torment”
[al-Maa'idah 5:36] 
“So this Day no ransom shall be taken from you (hypocrites), nor of those who disbelieved (in the Oneness of Allaah Islamic Monotheism). Your abode is the Fire. That is your mawla (friend — proper place), and worst indeed is that destination”
[al-Hadeed 57:15]
So Allaah tells us that if they did not believe in His Messenger and follow him and the message with which he was sent, and they persisted in their kufr until they meet Allaah on the Day of Resurrection in that state, then the blood ties of a relative or the intercession of a person of status will not benefit them, nor will any ransom be accepted from them, even if it were an earthful of gold. 
And the words “nor will they be helped” mean that on that Day no one will take pity on them and try to help them and save them from the punishment of Allaah, and as stated above, Allaah will not accept any ransom or intercession on the behalf of those who disbelieved in Him. No one will be able to save them from His punishment and no one will be able to offer them protection, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
And He protects (all), while against Whom there is no protector (i.e. if Allaah saves anyone, none can punish or harm him; and if Allaah punishes or harms anyone, none can save him)
[al-Mu’minoon 23:88] 
“So on that Day none will punish as He will punish.
And none will bind (the wicked, disbelievers and polytheists) as He will bind”
[al-Fajr 89:26]
Ibn Jareer al-Tabari said: The interpretation of the phrase “nor will they be helped” is that on that day no helper will help them, just as no intercessor will intercede for them, and no compensation or ransom will be accepted from them. On that Day favouritism will be invalid and bribes and there will be no room for intercession. There will be no mutual help or cooperation among people, and judgement will belong only to the Compeller, the Most Just, with whom intercessors and helpers will be to no avail. Evil deeds with be recompensed likewise and good deeds will be multiplied. This is like what Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
�But stop them, verily, they are to be questioned.
What is the matter with you? Why do you not help one another (as you used to do in the world)?
Nay, but that Day they shall surrender
[al-Saaffaat 37:24-26] 
end quote (from Ibn Katheer) 
Thus we know that the intercession which is stated here to be of no avail is the intercession of the kaafirs, or intercession for the kaafirs. 
2 – Repetition in the Qur’aan occurs frequently, and that is for many great reasons, some of which we know, but many of which are hidden from us. For example: 
1.Every phrase that is repeated may have a different meaning in each context, depending on what is mentioned before it. So that cannot be regarded as repetition.
For example, Allaah says in Soorat al-Mursalaat (interpretation of the meaning):  “Woe that Day to the deniers (of the Day of Resurrection)!” and repeats it ten times, because Allaah tells various stories (in this soorah), and follows each story with this phrase, as if commenting on each story with the words, “Woe that Day to the deniers (of the Day of Resurrection)!” Each story is different from the others, so this warning is repeated for those who deny it. 
2.Allaah does not vary the wording except when the meaning is different. This is only for a reason that is known to Him, and some of His creation may come to know of it, as He enables them to understand His Book [?}, or He may conceal it from them, and He is the All-Wise, All-Knowing.
3.Repetition of phrases may serve to emphasize the meaning and highlight the importance of what is being said. The more often it is repeated, the more important it is.
For more information see Qawaa’id al-Tafseer, 2/702 
3 – Are there certain principles or rules with regard to the order in which things are mentioned in the Qur’aan? 
It may be said – but Allaah knows best – that word order in the Qur’aan, and indeed in the Arabic language, is not based on a particular principle. Sometimes the thing that is mentioned first is that which happens first, and sometimes the thing that is mentioned first is the noblest, and sometimes it is difficult to give a reason. Based on this, we must be cautious about speaking on this topic. So we may explain that for which there seems to be a clear reason, without looking for far-fetched explanations, and with regard to cases where the reason is not clear, we refer them to the One Who knows best about them, for speaking about Allaah without knowledge is one of the gravest prohibitions, as is obvious, and it is not permissible to interpret the words of Allaah in ways that cannot apply. 
But it should be noted that when the Arabs mention things that come under the same category and mention them one after the other with the conjunction wa (“and”), this implies that there is no succession or order, so they usually do not mention one thing before another unless they care more for one of them because it is more noble, to be respected or important. 
Qawaa’id al-Tafseer by Dr Khaalid al-Sabt, 1/380 
4 – The reason why these verses are repeated, and the reason for the word order here in particular, is that this repetition is a reminder to the Children of Israel, and is repeated for emphasis. 
Moreover in the first passage, Allaah reminds them of their duties in return for the favour that was previously bestowed upon them, which is what is mentioned in the preceding and following verses. In the second passage He reminds them of His favour by which they were preferred over the ‘Alaameen (mankind and jinn) because of their belief in the Prophet of their time, so that they might attain this virtue again by believing in the Prophet of Islam, the final Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), so that they might be among the virtuous and escape, by means of their faith, the horrors and fear of the Day of Resurrection, just as those who followed Moosa (peace be upon him) and believed in him were saved from those terrors. 
Rooh al-Ma’aani by al-Aloosi, 1/373 
With regard to the reason why compensation is mentioned before intercession in the second verse, and after it in the second, some of the scholars have researched this matter and mentioned two reasons: 
1.It is a stylistic device aimed at creating variety in the text and avoid dullness of style.
2.As well as that, there is another subtle benefit which is: That in the first verse Allaah states that intercession will not be accepted, and in the second verse He states that the ransom will not be accepted, so that it is made clear that neither will be accepted. Because stating that intercession will not be accepted does not imply that the ransom will not accepted, it is mentioned in the first verse after intercession so that no one will imagine that if intercession is not accepted, the ransom may be accepted. And when He states in the second verse that the ransom will not be accepted, this does not imply that the kaafirs will not benefit from intercession, so that is followed by the statement that intercession will be to no avail, so that no one will imagine that if the ransom is not accepted, intercession may be to some avail. So from the two verses we understand that neither intercession nor ransom will be accepted, because the ways in which people seek redemption and salvation from what they fear varies. Sometimes they offer a ransom first and if it is not accepted they offer intercession, and sometimes they start with intercession and if that is not accepted they turn to the ransom.
Adapted from al-Tahreer wa’l-Tanweer by Ibn ‘Aashoor, 1/698. 
These subtle matters which we have mentioned are only ideas that are the result of the efforts of some of the scholars who have studied these verses. So the reasons that they have mentioned may be correct or not. The style of  the Qur’aan is undoubtedly the most eloquent, whether these ideas are correct or not. What really matters is to accept the wording of these verses which states that that on the Day of Resurrection no one, relative or stranger, will be able to help him, and he will look to his right and he will not see anything but that which he has sent forth, and he will look to his left and he will not see anything but that which he has sent forth, and he will look in front of him and will not see anything but the Fire. So he has to protect himself from the Fire by doing righteous deeds, even if that is giving charity with half a date, as was narrated in al-Saheehayn from the hadeeth of ‘Adiyy ibn Haatim (may Allaah be pleased with him), as narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6058; Muslim 1688. 
Intercession cannot benefit anyone except by Allaah’s Leave, and Allaah will never give any of the kaafirs permission to intercede or be interceded for regarding being brought forth from Hell. 
So people should put their trust in their Lord and none else, and ask Him to grant them the intercession of His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).

What is our duty towards the Maturidiyyah and the Deobandis?","Praise be to Allah.Who are the Deobandis?
The Deobandis are one of the groups of Muslims. This group is connected to and named after the University of Deoband – Dar al-Ulum – in India. It is an intellectual school of thought that is deeply rooted, and everyone who graduated from that university was influenced by its academic characteristics, so that they became known as Deobandis. 
Foundation of the University of Deoband
The University of Deoband was founded by a group of Indian scholars after the British had put a stop to the Islamic revolution in India in 1857 CE. Its establishment was a strong reaction against western advancement and its materialistic civilization in the Indian Subcontinent, aimed at saving the Muslims from the dangers of these circumstances, especially when Delhi, the capital, had been destroyed following the revolution and the British had taken full control of it. 
The scholars feared that their religion might be assimilated, so Shaykh Imdadullah al-Muhajir al-Makki and his student Shaykh Muhammad Qasim al-Nanatuwi, and their companions, drew up a plan to protect Islam and its teachings. They thought that the solution was to establish religious schools and Islamic centers, thus al-Madrasah al-Islamiyyah al-Arabiyyah was established in Deoband as a center for Islam and Shari`ah in India at the time of British rule. 
Prominent figures of the Deobandi intellectual school
The most prominent figures of this intellectual school:

Muhammad Qasim
Rashid Ahmad al-Kankuhi
Husayn Ahmad al-Madani
Muhammad Anwar Shah al-Kashmiri
Abu’l-Hasan al-Nadvi
Al-Muhaddith Habib al-Rahmaan al-A’zami

Beliefs of the Deobandis 
With regard to basic tenets of belief (‘aqidah) of the Deobandis, they follow the madhhab of Abu Mansur al-Maturidi.
They follow the madhhab of Imam Abu Hanifah with regard to fiqh and minor issues. 
They follow the Sufi tariqahs of the Naqshbandiyyah, Chishtiyyah, Qadiriyyah and Saharwardiyyah with regard to spiritual development. 
Thoughts of the Deobandis
The thoughts and principles of the Deobandi school may be summed up as follows: 

Preserving the teachings of Islam and its strength and rituals.
Spreading Islam and resisting destructive schools of thought and missionary activity.
Spreading Islamic culture and resisting the invading British culture.
Paying attention to spreading the Arabic language because it is the means of benefiting from the sources of Islamic shari’ah.
Combining reason and emotion, and knowledge and spirituality. (See al-Mawsu’ah al-Muyassarah fil Adyan wal Madhahib, 1/308) 

What is al-Maturidiyyah?
Because the Deobandis follow the Maturidi madhhab with regard to belief (‘aqidah), we have to define what al-Maturidiyyah is:
This is a philosophical (kalami) group which is named after Abu Mansur al-Maturidi. It is based on using rational and philosophical proof and evidence in disputes with opponents from among the Mu’tazilah, Jahamiyyah and others to establish the truths of religion and Islamic ‘aqidah (belief). 
Sources of Islam according to al- Maturidiyyah
With regard to sources, the Maturidiyyah divide the bases of religion into two categories depending on the source: 

Divine or rational: these are matters which are established independently by reason and the reports follow that. This includes issues of Tawhid and the Divine attributes. 
Legislative matters or transmitted reports, These are matters which reason states may or may not exist, but there is no way to prove rationally that they exist, such as prophethood, the torment of the grave and issues of the Hereafter. It should be noted that some of them regarded prophethood as coming under the heading of rational issues. 

It is obvious that this is contradictory to the methodology of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jama’ah , because the Quran, Sunnah and consensus of the Companions are the sources of guidance in their view. This is in addition to their bid’ah (innovation) of dividing the sources of religion into rational matters vs. transmitted reports, which was based on the false notion of the philosophers who assumed that the religious texts contradict reason, so they tried to mediate between reason and the transmitted reports. This led them to force reason into fields where it has no place, so they came up with false rulings which contradicted shari’ah, and that led them to say that they did not know what the texts mean and that only Allah knows their meaning, or to misinterpret them altogether. In the view of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jama’ah, on the other hand, there is no contradiction between sound reason and the sound transmitted reports. (See al-Mawsu’ah al-Muyassarah fi’l-Adyan wa’l-Madhahib al-Mu’asirah, 1/99) 
Attitude of Ahl al-Sunnah towards the Maturidiyyah
It was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that this ummah would split into seventy-three sects, all of which would be in the Fire apart from one. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained that the saved group is the Jama’ah, which is the group that follows the same path as the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his Companions. 
Undoubtedly Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jama’ah, who adhere to the Quran and Sunnah in terms of both knowledge and actions, are the saved group , and this description applies to them, i.e., they adhere to that which the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his Companions adhered to in terms of knowledge and actions. 
It is not sufficient for an individual or group merely to claim to belong to the Sunnah whilst going against the methodology of the salaf, namely the Sahabah and Tabi’in. Rather it is essential to adhere to their methodology in knowledge, action, approach and spiritual development. 
The Maturidiyyah are one of the groups whose opinions include true and false views, and some things that go against the Sunnah. It is known that these groups vary with regard to the truth, how near or far they are; the closer they are to the Sunnah, the closer they are to the truth and the right way. Among them are some who went against the Sunnah with regard to basic principles, and some who went against the Sunnah with regard to more subtle issues. There are some who refuted other groups who are farther away from the Sunnah, so they are to be praised with regard to their refutation of falsehood and what they have said of truth, but they have overstepped the mark in so far as they have rejected part of the truth and gone along with some falsehood. So they have refuted a serious bid’ah by means of a lesser bid’ah, and refuted falsehood with a lesser form of falsehood. This is the case with most of the philosophers (ahl al-kalam) who claim to belong to Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jama’ah…” (From the words of Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, al-Fatawa, 1/348) 
What is our duty towards the Maturidiyyah and the Deobandis?
There remains one important question to be answered, which is: what is our duty towards the Maturidiyyah and groups who hold similar beliefs such as the Deobandis and others?
The answer varies according to differences in the persons involved. 
If someone is stubborn and propagates his bid’ah, then we must warn others about him and explain where he has gone wrong and deviated. But if he does not propagate his bid’ah and it is clear from his words and actions that he is seeking the truth and striving for that purpose, then we should advise him and explain to him what is wrong with this belief, and guide him in a manner that is better; perhaps Allah will bring him back to the truth. This advice is included in the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Religion is sincerity (or sincere advice).” We [the Sahabah] asked, “To whom?” He said, “To Allah and His Book, and His Messenger, and to the leaders of the Muslims and their common folk.” (Narrated by Muslim, 55)

    it.” When the imam says the salaam, he should complete whatever he missed if 
    the bier is still there and has not been taken away. If he is afraid that it 
    will be taken away (before he finishes), then our fuqaha’ – may Allaah have 
    mercy on them – say that he has the choice of completing the prayer or of 
    following the imam, and saying the salaam with the imam. And Allaah knows 
    best.","70 Su’aalan fi Ahkaam al-Janaa’iz, p. 13, by Shaykh Muhammad al-Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen"
22490,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22490,The hadeeth: “Allaah loves those who are persistent in making du’aa’”,Is this hadeeth saheeh: “Allaah loves those who are persistent in making du’aa’”?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.There are ahaadeeth which 
    are in circulation among people and are often-repeated, and some people may 
    be keen to spread them because they are unaware that they are not saheeh and 
    cannot be attributed to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him). The Muslim should be cautious and should not attribute anything 
    to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) except that 
    which he knows is proven to be soundly narrated from him. 
This hadeeth – “Allaah loves those who are stubborn in 
    making du’aa’” – is not saheeh and cannot be attributed to the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).
It was narrated by al-Tabaraani in al-Du’aa’ 
    (2/795), by al-‘Aqeeli in al-Du’afa’ al-Kabeer (4/452), by Ibn ‘Adiyy 
    in al-Kaamil, 7/2621).
Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said in al-Talkhees: It was 
    narrated only by Yoosuf ibn al-Safar from al-Awzaa’i, and he is matrook 
    (rejected). Al-Albaani said in al-Irwa’ (3/143); It is mawdoo’ 
    (fabricated).
And he stated in al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah 
    (2/96-637) that it is baatil (false).
This is with regard to whether this wording can be 
    attributed to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).
With regard to the meaning:
What is meant by being persistent in du’aa’ is repeating 
    it. It is proven that this was what the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) did. Muslim (1794) narrated that Ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah 
    be pleased with him) said: When the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) made du’aa’ he would repeat it three times, and when he 
    asked he would ask three times.
Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:
This shows that it is mustahabb to repeat du’aa’s three 
    times. The phrase “and when he asked” refers to du’aa’ as well, but the idea 
    is repeated in different words by way of emphasis.
Al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “Chapter 
    on repeating du’aa’s.” Then he mentioned the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah (may 
    Allaah be pleased with her), that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) made du’aa’ to Allaah and repeated the du’aa’, when the 
    Jew Labeed ibn al-A’sam put a spell on him. ‘Aa’ishah said: Until one day, 
    or one night, the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) made du’aa’, then he made du’aa’, then he made du’aa’… Narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari, 6391; Muslim, 2189.
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in 
    al-Daa’ wa’l-Dawa’ (p. 25): One of the most beneficial of remedies is 
    persisting in du’aa’.
In Kitaab al-Zuhd by Imam Ahmad (305) it is 
    narrated from Qataadah: Mawraq said: I can find no other likeness for the 
    believer except that of a man who is at sea, clinging onto a piece of wood, 
    and saying, “O Lord, O Lord,” that Allaah might save him.

22494,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22494,He wants to kill his wife’s relatives after they robbed him and took his wife by deceit,"A man married me to his sister in front of two witnesses, one of whom was his brother and the other drew up the marriage contract. I saw the woman and she saw me before the marriage was performed, and her mother and all her family knew that I was of a different nationality than them. The woman, her family, her guardian and the witnesses all accepted that, and the marriage contract was done. The man told us that the woman had gotten divorced from her previous husband whom she had not seen and he had not seen her. After the woman got pregnant from me, her brother started to demand money from us and we gave him enough money to live a good life with his family, but he asked for a lot of money and I refused to give it to him. After the woman got pregnant and two months before she gave birth, he came and asked my wife to go and visit her sick mother (and he took her away by means of this trick), then he gave her to another man and said that he was her original husband, and that my marriage to her was not valid; the man was of sound mind and mature and had knowledge of Islam. Before I take any action against him and his family because of protective jealousy concerning my honour, I want to ask about the Islamic ruling on this calamity that has befallen me. Please note that my wife has given birth and they said to me, this child is your daughter. How can the child be my daughter if my marriage to her was not legitimate, as they claim? Please advise us, may Allaah reward you, before I kill this family, old and young, and in sha Allaah I will follow the Islamic ruling and the fatwa of the scholars of Islam.",,,"Praise be to Allah.If her brother was her 
    guardian, then the marriage is valid and they have no right to take your 
    wife away from you. This is wrongdoing on their part. They had no right to 
    harass you in order to take money from you. The wealth of a Muslim is not 
    permissible to anyone unless he gives it willingly. 
You have to go to the 
    sharee’ah courts and turn to the scholars and prominent figures in order to 
    resolve this problem. 
With regard to killing 
    him and killing any member of his family, all of that, as you mention in 
    your question, is a major sin that is worse than blowing up the Ka’bah. 
Whoever does that, the 
    curse of Allaah, the angels and all the people will be upon him, and his 
    recompense will be Hell, to abide therein for eternity.

22498,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22498,“His knowledge of my situation is sufficient asking”,Is this hadeeth saheeh: “His knowledge of my situation is sufficient asking”?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.These words were narrated 
    from Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) when his people threw him into the fire 
    with the catapult. He was met by Jibreel who asked him: “O Ibraaheem, do you 
    have any need?” Ibraaheem said, “Of you, no.” Jibreel said: “Then ask your 
    Lord.” Ibraaheem said: “His knowledge of my situation is sufficient 
    asking.” 

    Al-Baghawi mentioned this in his tafseer (commentary) on 
    Soorat al-Anbiya’, and indicated that it is da’eef (weak).  (5/327).  

    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in Majmoo’ al-Fataawa 
    (1/183): 

    The report which says that when Ibraaheem was thrown into the 
    fire Jibreel said to him, “Ask (of your Lord)” and he said, “His knowledge 
    of my situation is sufficient asking” has no sound isnaad, and it is false. 
    Rather what is proven in al-Saheeh from Ibn 'Abbaas is that he said, 
    “Hasbi Allaah wa ni’m al-wakeel (Allaah is sufficient for me and He 
    is the best dispoer of affairs).”  
With regard to Ibraaheem 
    asking of his Lord, this is mentioned in the Qur’aan in more than one place, 
    so how could he have said, “His knowledge of my situation is sufficient 
    asking” ?? 

    Ibn Taymiyah also said (8/358):   

    With regard to his saying “His knowledge of my situation is 
    sufficient asking”, this is false and goes against what Allaah tells us 
    about Ibraaheem and other Prophets and how they prayed to Allaah and asked 
    of Him. It also goes against what Allaah has commanded His slaves to ask Him 
    for, which is the good things of this world and the Hereafter, such as when 
    they said (interpretation of the meaning): 
""Our 
    Lord! Give us in this world that which is good and in the Hereafter that 
    which is good, and save us from the torment of the Fire!""
[al-Baqarah 2:201]
And making du’aa’ to 
    Allaah and asking of Him and putting one's trust in Him are all acts of 
    worship that are prescribed in Islam. 

    This hadeeth was also mentioned by al-Albaani in 
    al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah (21). He said: It is one of the Israa’eeliyyaat 
    (reports from Jewish sources) and has no basis in any report that can be 
    attributed to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
    Some of the Sufis adopted this meaning when they said, “Your asking of Him 
    is an accusation of Him.” 

    Al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:  

    This is serious misguidance. Would the Prophets accuse their 
    Lord by asking Him for various things? Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) said:  
“O our Lord! I have made some of my 
    offspring to dwell in an uncultivable valley by Your Sacred House (the 
    Ka‘bah at Makkah) in order, O our Lord, that they may perform As‑Salaat 
    (Iqaamat‑as‑Salat). So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, 
    and (O Allaah) provide them with fruits so that they may give thanks.

    O our Lord! Certainly, You know what we conceal and what 
    we reveal. Nothing on the earth or in the heaven is hidden from Allaah…”

    [Ibraaheem 14:37-38 – interpretation of the meaning]

    Many du’aa’ of the Prophets are mentioned in the Qur’aan and 
    Sunnah.  

    The one who says such a thing seems to be unaware of the fact 
    that du’aa’, which means beseeching and turning to Allaah, is a great act of 
    worship, regardless of what need one is asking to be met. Hence the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Du’aa’ is worship.” 
    Then he recited the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And your Lord said: ‘Invoke Me [i.e. believe in My 
    Oneness (Islamic Monotheism) and ask Me for anything] I will respond to your 
    (invocation). Verily, those who scorn My worship [i.e. do not invoke Me, and 
    do not believe in My Oneness, (Islamic Monotheism)] they will surely enter 
    Hell in humiliation!”
 [Ghaafir 40:60]
    
    That is because in du’aa’ the slave demonstrates his complete 
    submission to his Lord and his need for Him and his dependence upon Him. 
    Whoever turns away from du’aa’ turns away from worship of Allaah. No wonder 
    there are so many ahaadeeth which enjoin and encourage du’aa’, and the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever does 
    not make du’aa’ to Allaah, He will be angry with him.” 

    This was narrated by al-Haakim, who classed it as saheeh, and 
    al-Dhahabi agreed with him. It is a hasan hadeeth.  

    And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said: “Ask Allaah for everything, even a lace for your shoes, because 
    if Allaah does not make it easy for you to obtain it, you will not be bale 
    to obtain it.” Narrated by Ibn al-Sunni (no. 349) with a hasan isnaad, and 
    it has corroborating reports in the hadeeth of Anas which was narrated by 
    al-Tirmidhi (4/292 and others). 
In conclusion, this 
    report which is attributed to Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) could not have 
    been uttered by any Muslim who understands the importance of du’aa’ in 
    Islam, so how can it have been said by the one who called us Muslims?
