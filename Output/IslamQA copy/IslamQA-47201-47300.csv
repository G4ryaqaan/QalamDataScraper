I have good experience, praise be to Allaah. My father wants me to work with him in our business, but I have a few problems, the first of which is that I am not good at business.

 The second problem is that this business involves some things that are not Islamic, such as notebooks on which are pictures of animate beings, and music books, and cards with pictures of animate beings, and playing cards and shavers. (I live in a country where most men do not have beards).",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Undoubtedly honouring one's parents is one of the greatest 
    acts of worship by means of which a person may draw closer to his Lord. 
    Allaah has enjoined good treatment of them in all circumstances, even if 
    they disbelieve in Allaah. We have already discussed this in questions no.

    With regard to what you have mentioned, try to convince your 
    father to let you do work that you are good at, through which you can 
    produce something good for others, for every one has an affinity with that 
    for which he was created. Part of doing things well and fulfilling the trust 
    is for each person to be placed in a job for which he is suited. Part of 
    failing to work well, wasting money and neglecting the trust is to assign 
    work to those who are not qualified to do it. Then try to help him to find a 
    good and trustworthy alternative, who can help him with his business instead 
    of you, even if you have to pay part of his wages. Do that to please your 
    father. If the situation requires you to spend part of your free time with 
    your father, then do that.  

    “and do good. Truly, Allaah loves Al-Muhsinoon(the good-doers)”

    [al-Baqarah 2:195] 

    “and be dutiful and good to parents”

    [al-Baqarah 2:83]
If you try hard to do 
    that, but you do not manage to convince your father,  then my advice to you 
    is that you should take a leave of absence from your current job, if 
    possible, and join your father in his work for this period. Perhaps things 
    will go as you wish during this time. If you cannot take this leave of 
    absence, then you do not have to give up your job or pay any of your wealth 
    or divorce your wife in order to please your parents, if that will cause 
    harm to you. Your not obeying them in this case is not regarded as ‘uqooq 
    (the defiant disobedience of parents that is forbidden in Islam), in sha 
    Allah. See question no. 9594 and 
    47040. 

    A man said to Imam Ahmad: I have a slave woman and my mother 
    is asking me to sell her. 
He said: Are you afraid 
    that your heart will follow her? (i.e., are you afraid that your heart will 
    remain attached to the slave woman if you sell her?). He said: Yes. He said: 
    Do not sell her. He said: But she (my mother) is saying that she will not be 
    pleased with me unless I sell her. He said: If you fear that (selling the 
    slave woman) will affect you, then she (your mother) has no right to make 
    such demands. 

    Al-Adaab al-Shar’iyyah by Ibn 
    Muflih, 1/448. 

    But you must also strive to soften your father’s heart and be 
    gentle in your dealing with him. Also try to purify your business from 
    selling things that it is forbidden to sell or that you think are most 
    likely to be used in haraam ways. Do not sell these things even if you 
    father tells you to do so, because there is no obedience to any created 
    being if it involves disobedience towards the Creator.  

    What you have mentioned about notebooks with pictures on 
    them, this is a problem that is widespread. If these pictures are taken from 
    photographs and are not drawn by hand, then there is no sin in selling these 
    notebooks with these pictures, in sha Allaah, because what is being bought 
    is not the picture in and of itself, but rather the notebook. But if it is a 
    picture of a woman or some indecent image, of which there are many such, 
    then it is not permissible to sell it because that is spreading fitnah and 
    corruption, and because many people look for such pictures. 

    With regard to selling music books, this is haraam, because 
    it is helping in evil. The same applies to selling shavers to one whom one 
    thinks will most likely use it to shave his beard. But if he is going to use 
    it for some permissible purpose, then it is permissible to sell it. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was 
    asked: 

    My father has a store in which he sells electrical appliances 
    such as TVs, VCRs and some musical instruments, as well as gold watches. He 
    asked me to sit in the shop and sell things, but I refused. Is this 
    considered to be defiant disobedience to my father? What should I do? 

    He replied: 

    This is not defiant disobedience, if you refused to do the 
    haraam action that your father does. But what you have to do is to advise 
    him and tell him that this is haraam and his earnings are haraam. If he 
    follows right guidance, then this is what you want. But if he does not 
    follow right guidance, then the sin is on him and you will have the reward 
    for advising him, because Allaah said to His Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Not upon you 
    (Muhammad) is their guidance”

    [al-Baqarah 2:272]
If he tells you: Sit in 
    the store and sell things, do not sell anything that will be used for haraam 
    purposes, but sell the things that people usually use for permissible 
    purposes. So do not sell things such as radios, cassette recorders, VCRs and 
    TVs, because most of those who buy these things are going to use them for 
    haraam purposes.

47273,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47273,"Is it better to give the adhaan and take care of the mosque, or to seek knowledge?","I have been religiously committed for a while, praise be to Allaah, and Allaah has enabled me to pray regularly in congregation in the mosque at all times. When the administration of the mosque saw that I am so regular, they put me in charge of opening and closing the mosque, and giving the adhaan. But there are a number of lessons in fiqh and Tawheed that are given in mosques that are far away from our mosque, and the brothers told me that seeking knowledge is better than giving the adhaan. But I am now tied to the mosque at all times even though I have brought some CDs of these lessons and listen to them. Is it better to give the adhaan or to seek knowledge?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Giving the adhaan, coming early to prayer and taking care of 
    the mosque are all great acts of worship and beneficial righteous deeds 
    which are encouraged in Islam, in many well-known ahaadeeth. 

    The texts also speak of the virtue and honourable status of 
    knowledge and encourage us to seek it. 

    It should be noted that seeking knowledge may be an 
    individual obligation (fard ‘ayn), i.e., the knowledge that makes one’s 
    belief (‘aqeedah), worship and actions correct. It is not permissible to 
    neglect this kind of knowledge or to be distracted from seeking it, either 
    by the adhaan or anything else. 

    The knowledge that is essential includes: knowledge of 
    ‘aqeedah (belief, doctrine) and Tawheed in general, knowledge of the rulings 
    on prayer and fasting, knowledge of the rulings on zakaah for those who have 
    wealth on which zakaah is due, and knowledge of the rulings on Hajj for 
    those who want to go to Hajj. 

    It is also essential to know the rulings on buying and 
    selling for those who want to engage in that; rulings on marriage and 
    divorce, food and drink, and other actions and transactions in which people 
    may wish to engage. 

    Al-Mannaawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: There are 
    nearly twenty different opinions regarding what areas of knowledge should 
    take precedence, all of which offer evidence to support their view. The best 
    that can be said is what al-Qaadi said: What we cannot do without knowing, 
    such as knowledge of the Creator (Allaah, may He be exalted and glorified) 
    and the Prophethood of His Messengers, and how to pray etc., knowing these 
    things is an individual obligation. 

    Fayd al-Qadeer, 4/267. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
    Seeking Islamic knowledge is a communal obligation (fard kifaayah); if 
    sufficient people undertake it, then for the rest it becomes Sunnah. And 
    seeking knowledge may be an individual obligation. The guideline is if it is 
    needed for an act of worship that he wants to do or a transaction or 
    interaction he wants to engage in; in that case he must learn how to worship 
    Allaah by doing this act of worship, and how to undertake that transaction 
    etc. Apart from that, seeking knowledge is a communal obligation and the 
    seeker of knowledge should feel that he is undertaking a communal obligation 
    so that he will attain the reward for undertaking an obligation as well as 
    gaining knowledge. 

    From Kitaab al-‘Ilm. 
You have done well by 
    bringing the CDs of the lessons, because that is a means of seeking 
    knowledge, although it does not mean that you do not need to sit with the 
    scholars and learn from them, and ask them about anything you do not 
    understand. 

    It seems that in your situation, where you are trying to 
    decide whether it is better to give the adhaan and take care of the mosque, 
    or to seek knowledge that is not an individual obligation, that you should 
    try to combine the best of both, by regularly attending some classes, and 
    continuing to look after the mosque, and make up for the classes you miss by 
    using the CDs, as well as asking the scholars about anything you do not 
    understand. If the administration of the mosque do not agree with you being 
    absent sometimes, then give precedence to seeking knowledge, for it is a 
    source of honour and status in this world and in the Hereafter, especially 
    since there will never be a shortage of people to give the adhaan and take 
    care of the mosque, but those who are serious in the pursuit of knowledge 
    are few and far between. 

    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, explaining 
    the virtue of knowledge:  (108): Many of the imams clearly stated that the 
    best of deeds after the obligatory duties is seeking knowledge. Al-Shaafa’i 
    said: There is nothing after the obligatory duties that is better than 
    seeking knowledge. This is what his companions narrated was his opinion. 
    This was also stated by Sufyaan al-Thawri, and the Hanafis narrated this 
    from Abu Haneefah. Three opinions were narrated from Imam Ahmed: 

    The first was that the best of deeds after the obligatory 
    duties is seeking knowledge, because it was said to him: “What thing is 
    dearest to you, for me to sit at night copying (texts) or to offer voluntary 
    prayers? He said: Your copying (texts) and learning about your religion from 
    it, that is dearer to me. Al-Khallaal quoted many texts from him in 
    Kitaab al-‘Ilm about the virtue of knowledge, for example, he said: 
    People’s need for knowledge is greater than their need for food and drink. 

    The second is that the best of deeds after the obligatory 
    duties is voluntary prayer, and he quoted as evidence for this the words 
    “Know that the best of your deeds is prayer” and the hadeeth of Abu Dharr, 
    when he asked him (the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him)) about prayer and he said “(It) is the best that has been prescribed.” 
    And he quoted the fact that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) advised the one who asked to be close to him in Paradise to do 
    a lot of prostration, i.e., prayer, and the fact that in another hadeeth he 
    said: “You should prostrate, for you do not do one prostration for Allaah, 
    but Allaah will raise you one degree (in status) thereby and will remove one 
    sin from you thereby.” And there are many other ahaadeeth which speak of the 
    virtue of prayer. 

    The third opinion is that jihad is the best of deeds, and he 
    (Imam Ahmad) said: I cannot think of anything that matches jihad. And there 
    is no doubt that most of the ahaadeeth speak of prayer and jihad. 

    With regard to Maalik, Ibn al-Qaasim said: I heard Maalik 
    say: Some people pursued worship and ignored knowledge, then they engaged in 
    an armed rebellion against the ummah of Muhammad. If they had sought 
    knowledge, it would have prevented them from doing that. Maalik said: Abu 
    Moosa al-Ash’ari wrote to ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (saying) that there are 
    people with us who read the Qur’aan, such and such a number of them. ‘Umar 
    wrote back to him, telling him to allocate them a stipend from the bayt 
    al-Maal (treasury of the Islamic state). The following year, he wrote to him 
    saying that many people, more than before, were reading the Qur’aan. ‘Umar 
    wrote back to him telling him to erase their names from the record saying, 
    “I am afraid that people will be hasty in reading the Qur’aan and will not 
    understand the religion properly, then they will distort its meanings.” Ibn 
    Wahb said: Maalik ibn Anas was in front of me and I put my tablets down and 
    got up to pray, and he said: “What you have got up for is better than that 
    which you have left.” From Miftaah Daar al-Sa’aadah, 1/119.

47289,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47289,She entered ihraam and did tawaaf and saa’i when she was menstruating,A woman did Hajj a few years ago. She entered ihraam from the meeqaat and did tawaaf and saa’i whilst she was menstruating (I do not know whether she did that out of ignorance). I hope that you can advise us whatever the case. Then she did ‘umrah after that several times. What is the ruling?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not essential to be free of menses in order to enter ihraam and do saa’i, but the menstruating woman is not allowed to do tawaaf around the House until she is pure. 
Based on this, a woman who wants to do Hajj or ‘umrah should enter ihraam from the meeqaat even if she is menstruating, and she should form the intention of entering ihraam. The evidence for that is the fact that Asma’ bint ‘Umays, the wife of Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) gave birth, when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was camped at Dhu’l-Hulayfah (which is the meeqaat for the people of Madeenah), on his way to do Hajj. She sent word to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) asking him what she should do. He said: “Do ghusl and tie a piece of cloth around yourself and enter ihraam.” What is meant by tying a piece of cloth is placing a piece of cloth over the vagina and tying it in place, then entering ihraam whether for Hajj or ‘Umrah. The blood of menstruation is like the blood of nifaas, so when the menstruating woman reaches the meeqaat, she should do ghusl and tie a piece of cloth around herself, and enter ihraam, in accordance with this hadeeth. 
Similarly saa’i between al-Safa and al-Marwah done by a menstruating woman is valid, but her tawaaf is not valid. The evidence for that is that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her), when she menstruated during ‘umrah: “Do everything that the pilgrims do, but do not circumambulate the House until you become pure.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1650), Muslim (1211). 
Based on this, then this woman did not go through the second stage of exiting ihraam for Hajj, so she has to repeat the tawaaf, and her husband should not have intercourse with her, if she is married, until she has done tawaaf. 
This is the ruling on this issue, whether she did that knowingly or unknowingly. But if she did that knowingly then she sinned by doing this haraam action with no excuse. But if she was unaware, then there is no sin on her. But she has to do this tawaaf and she has not gone through the second stage of exiting ihraam until she does it, as stated above. The fact that she did ‘umrah several times after that does not relieve her of the obligation to do this tawaaf. 
The Standing Committee was asked about the Hajj of a menstruating woman. They said: A menstruating woman is not prevented from doing Hajj. The one who enters ihraam when she is menstruating may do all the actions of Hajj, but she should not circumambulate the House until her period ends and she does ghusl. The same applies to a woman who is bleeding following childbirth (nifaas). If she does all the essential parts of Hajj then her Hajj is valid.” 
Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 11/172. 
Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about a woman who entered the Haram and did tawaaf and prayed when she was menstruating. He said: It is not permissible for a woman who is menstruating or bleeding following childbirth to pray, whether in Makkah or in her own country or anywhere else, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Is it not the case that when she is menstruating she does not pray or fast?” Moreover the Muslims are unanimously agreed that it is not permissible for a menstruating woman to fast or to pray. This woman who did that has to repent to Allaah and seek forgiveness for what she did. As for her tawaaf when she was menstruating, it is not valid, but her saa’i is valid, because the correct view is that it is permissible to do saa’i before tawaaf during Hajj. Based on this, she has to repeat the tawaaf, because tawaaf al-ifaadah is one of the essential parts of Hajj, and the second stage of exiting ihraam cannot be completed without it. Based on that, her husband should not have intercourse with her, if she is married, until she does tawaaf. If she is not married then she cannot get married until she has done this tawaaf.
