Do cats invalidate prayer if they pass in front of you?


Are cats pure?","Praise be to Allah.What invalidates prayer if it passes in front of you?
Prayer is invalidated if one of three things mentioned by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) walks in front of the worshipper . He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Prayer is invalidated by a woman, a donkey or a dog ; that may be prevented by something equal in height to the back of a saddle [placed in front of the worshipper as a sutrah or screen].” (Narrated by Muslim, 511) 
According to one report, “a black dog.” The narrator said: “I said, ‘O Abu Dharr, what is the difference between a black dog and a red or yellow dog?’ He said, ‘O son of my brother, I asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) the same question, and he said, “The black dog is a devil.”’” (Narrated by Muslim, 510) 
This ruling applies if one of the things mentioned passes in front of the worshipper and he does not have a Sutrah or object to serve as a screen in front of him. But if he has a screen in front of him and the person or animal passes beyond that Sutrah, then his prayer is not affected, because of the Hadith of Abu Juhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: “I heard my father narrating that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) led them in prayer in Al-Bat-ha’, and in front of them was an ‘Anzah (a short spear, iron-tipped at its lower end). He prayed two Rak`ahs for Dhuhr followed by two Rak`ahs for `Asr, and a woman and a donkey passed in front of him.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 495)
This ruling applies to the Imam and to one who is praying alone; with regard to the members of a congregation praying behind an Imam, the Sutrah of the Imam is also a Sutrah for them. Please refer to question no. 3404 . 
Do cats invalidate prayer if they pass in front of you?
As for cats , they do not invalidate the prayer even if they pass in front of you, because the basic guideline is that the prayer is valid, and there is no evidence to suggest that cats can invalidate the prayer. 
But the worshipper should try hard to ensure that nothing passes in front of him. `Amr ibn Shu’ayb narrated from his father that his grandfather said: “We stopped with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in Thaniyyat Adhakhir and the time for prayer came, so he prayed facing a wall which lay in the direction of the Qiblah, and we were behind him. A lamb came and tried to pass in front of him and he kept pushing it back until its belly was pushed up against the wall, then it passed behind him.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 708; Al-Albani classed it as sound in Sahih Abu Dawud, 652) 
Are cats pure?
Cats are pure , and based on that, if a cat drinks from a vessel of water, the vessel does not become impure, because of the Hadith of Kabshah bint Ka’b ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with her), who was the wife of Abu Qatadah’s son, she said: “Abu Qatadah came in and I poured water for him to do Wudu. A cat came and drank some of the water so he tilted the vessel to let it drink. He saw me looking at him and said, ‘Do you find it strange, O daughter of my brother?’ I said, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said that they are not impure, rather they are among those who go around amongst you.’” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 92; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi)

Someone is asking for proof. Can you please explain it.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The wording of the 
    hadeeth is: It was narrated that Abu Sa’eed (may Allah be pleased with him) 
    said: When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ate or 
    drank something, he would say, “Al-hamdu Lillah illathi at’amana wa saqana

    Shaykh al-‘Albani 
    said in his commentary on al-Kalim al-Tayyib (189) by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn 
    Taymiyah: 

    Its isnad (chain 
    of narration) is da’eef, because the narrators were confused about it, as 
    explained by al-Hafiz in al-Tahtheeb; and by al-Hafiz al-Mazzi before him in 
    Tuhfat al-Ashraf, 3/353-354; and by Imam al-Bukhari before them in 
    al-Tareekh al-Kabeer, 1/1/353-354; and by al-Nasai in al-Yawm wa’l-Laylah, 
    288-290. And al-Tirmithi, despite his well-known lenience, did not class it 
    as hasan (sound), 

    There are similar 
    ahadeeth (narrations) which are proven from the Prophet (peace and blessings 
    of Allah be upon him) concerning this matter, such as the following: 

    -         It was 
    narrated from Abu Umamah (may Allah be pleased with him) that when the 
    Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had finished eating – and 
    one time he said, When the table was cleared – he would say, “Al-hamdu 
    Lillaah illadhi kafana wa arwana ghayra makfiyyin wa la makfoor (Praise be 
    to Allah Who has satisfied our needs and quenched our thirst. Your favour 
    cannot be compensated or denied).” And on one occasion he said, “Al-hamdu 
    Lillahi rabbina ghayr mukfiyyin wa la muwadda’in wa la mustaghna rabbana 
    (Praise be to Allah our Lord. Your favour cannot be compensated, nor can be 
    left, nor can be dispensed with, O our Lord).” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5459.

    -         It was 
    narrated that Abu Ayyoob al-Ansari (may Allah be pleased with him) said: 
    When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ate 
    or drank something, he would say, “Al-hamdu Lillah illathi at’ama wa saqa wa

It is prohibited for her to travel for Hajj or for any other reason without a Mahram , and she has to be patient until Allah makes it easy for one of her Mahrams to travel with her. 
The ways of goodness are many. If a Muslim cannot do one act of worship, he may strive hard in those acts of worship that he can do, until Allah makes it easy for him to do the acts of worship that he could not do. 
By the bounty of Allah towards His believing slaves, if a person resolves to do an act of worship but he is unable to do it because of some excuse, he will be granted the reward of one who does it. Al-Bukhari (4423) narrated from Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came back from the campaign of Tabuk and when he drew close to Madinah he said: “In Madinah there are some people who, whenever you marched or crossed a valley, were with you.” They said: “O Messenger of Allah, but they were in Madinah.” He said, “They were in Madinah because some excuse kept them back.” 
The scholars of the Standing Committee said:  
“A woman who does not have a Mahram does not have to do Hajj , because in her case a Mahram is part of being able to do Hajj, and being able to do it is one of the conditions of Hajj being obligatory. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah) to the House (Ka`bah) is a duty that mankind owes to Allah, those who can afford the expenses (for one’s conveyance, provision and residence).” [Al `Imran 3:97]
It is not permissible for her to travel for Hajj or for any other purpose unless she is accompanied by her husband or a Mahram , because of the report narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim from Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him), that he heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “No man should be alone with a woman unless her Mahram is present, and no woman should travel unless she has a Mahram with her .”  A man stood up and said: “O Messenger of Allah, my wife has gone out for Hajj, and I have enlisted for such and such a campaign.” He said: “Go and do Hajj with your wife.” This was also the view of Al-Hasan, An-Nakha’i, Ahmad, Is-Haq, Ibn Al-Mundhir and Ashab Al-ra’i, and it is the correct view, because of the verse quoted, as well as the general meaning of the Hadiths which forbid a woman to travel without her husband or a Mahram. Malik, Ash-Shafi`i and Al-Awza`i held a different opinion and each of them stipulated a condition (allowing her to do that), but with no evidence. Ibn Al-Mundhir said: they did not follow the apparent meaning of the Hadith, and each of them stipulated a condition (allowing her to do that), but with no evidence.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah lil-Buhuth Al-`Ilmiyyah wal-‘Ifta’, 11/90, 91) 
And they said: 
“If the situation is as described – that it is not easy for your husband or a Mahram of yours to travel with you to perform the obligation of Hajj – then you are not obliged to do it so long as this is the case, because the accompaniment of your husband or Mahram on the journey for Hajj is one of the conditions of Hajj being obligatory for you. It is prohibited for you to travel for Hajj or for any other purpose without that, even if you go with your brother’s wife and a group of women, according to the correct scholarly view, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “No woman should travel except with a Mahram.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim). That is unless your brother also travels with his wife, in which case it is permissible to travel with him, because he is a Mahram for you. Strive to do righteous deeds that do not need you to travel, and be patient in the hope that Allah will make things easier for you and enable you to go for Hajj with your husband or Mahram.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah lil-Buhuth Al-`Ilmiyyah wal-‘Ifta’, 11/96)

25843,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/25843,Objection to the fact that a man will have hoor ‘iyn who will share her husband with her,"What happens in paradise, with a couple who have been married. I have heard that the wife will be with her husband, but that the husband will in addition to her, have 70 women (hoors) at his service. 

This to me does not seem like a fair concept for the women, to share their husbands in this way.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
The believer must submit to the rulings and 
    decrees of Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The only saying of the faithful
    believers, when they are called to Allaah (His Words, the Qur’aan) and His Messenger, to judge between 
    them, is that they say: ‘We hear and we obey.’ And such are the successful (who will live forever in Paradise)”
[al-Noor 24:51]
If the believer is confused about anything in 
    the rulings of Allaah, and he does not know what it means or what the reason behind it is, then he must say as those who are firmly grounded in 
    knowledge say: 
“We believe in it; the whole of it (clear 
    and unclear Verses) are from our Lord”
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:7 – interpretation of the 
    meaning]
It is not permissible for the believer to say 
    that one of the rulings of Allaah is not fair; exalted be Allaah far above that. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And your Lord is not at all unjust to 
    (His) slaves”
[Fussilat 41:46]
There is no rule that is better than the rule 
    of Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Is not Allaah the Best of judges?”
[al-Teen 95:8]
“Do they then seek the judgement of (the 
    days of) Ignorance? And who is better in judgement than Allaah for a people who have firm Faith?”
[al-Maa’idah 5:50]
Secondly: 
In this question there are two mistakes and a 
    misunderstanding. The first mistake is where the questioner says that in Paradise a man will have seventy hoor ‘iyn. What is proven in the saheeh 
    Sunnah is that the martyr (shaheed) will have seventy-two hoor ‘iyn. The least of the people of Paradise will have two wives, and some will have 
    more than that. 
It was narrated that al-Miqdaam ibn Ma’di 
    Yakrib said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The martyr has six blessings with Allaah: he will be 
    forgiven from the first drop of blood shed; he will be shown his place in Paradise; he will be protected from the torment of the grave; he will be 
    safe from the greater terror; a crown of dignity will be placed on his head, one ruby of which is better than this world and everything in it; he 
    will be married to seventy-two wives from al-hoor al-‘iyn; and he will intercede for seventy of his relatives.” 
Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1663; Ibn Maajah, 
    2799; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
And more than that has been narrated. Abu 
    Na’eem narrated in Sifat al-Jannah from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “A man will go to one hundred virgins in one day – i.e., in Paradise.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in
    al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 367. 
It was narrated from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The lowest of the people of Paradise in status will be a man whose face Allaah will turn away from the 
    Fire towards Paradise, and make a shady tree appear before him. …  Then he will enter his house and his two wives from among al-hoor al-‘iyn will 
    enter after him. They will say: ‘Praise be to Allah Who has created you for us and us for you.’ And he will say: ‘No one has been given the like 
    of that which I have been given.’” Narrated by Muslim, 188. 
Al-Haafiz said:  
The apparent meaning is that the least that 
    will be given to each of them will be two wives. 
Thirdly: 
The second mistake is the questioner’s saying 
    that al-hoor al-‘iyn will serve the man. This is not correct, rather the ones who will serve the people of Paradise will be boys of everlasting 
    youth. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And round about them will (serve) boys of 
    everlasting youth. If you see them, you would think them scattered pearls”
[al-Insaan 76:19]
Al-hoor al-‘iyn will be wives of the men in 
    Paradise, in addition to their wives from among the people of this world. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So (it will be). And We shall marry them 
    to Hoor (fair females) with wide lovely eyes”
[al-Dukhaan 44:54] 
“They will recline (with ease) on thrones 
    arranged in ranks. And We shall marry them to Hoor (fair females) with wide lovely eyes”
[al-Toor 52:20]
Fourthly: 
The misunderstanding is when the questioner 
    says: “This to me does not seem like a fair concept for the women, to share their husbands in this way.” 
Fairness or justice is to be found in the 
    rulings of sharee’ah, not in what a person thinks who does not know sharee’ah and its rulings, let alone the reasons behind them. 
The sister who is asking this question thinks 
    that the jealousy in her heart, and what it leads to of depression and sorrow will remain with her in Paradise, but this is not correct, and this 
    is why there is this misunderstanding in her question.  
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And We shall remove from their breasts 
    any (mutual) hatred or sense of injury (which they had, if at all, in the life of this world); rivers flowing under them, and they will say: ‘All 
    the praises and thanks be to Allaah, Who has guided us to this, and never could we have found guidance, were it not that Allaah had guided us! 
    Indeed, the Messengers of our Lord did come with the truth.’ And it will be cried out to them: ‘This is the Paradise which you have inherited for 
    what you used to do’”
[al-A’raaf 7:43]
There is nothing but joy and happiness in Paradise; there is no room for hatred and rancour in 
    the hearts of the people of Paradise. Al-hoor al-‘iyn are something which Allaah has created to honour the people of Paradise and to increase 
    their delight. Moreover a man will be given the strength of one hundred men for intercourse, so the large number will not have any effect on a 
    woman, and her feelings towards her co-wives and her husband’s concubines will not be like her feelings in this world. 
It was narrated that Zayd ibn Arqam said: The 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to me: “A man in Paradise will be given the strength of one hundred men 
    in eating, drinking, desire and intercourse.” A Jewish man said: “The one who eats and drinks will need to relieve himself.” The Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to him, “The way in which one of them will relieve himself will be by means of sweat 
    which will come out through his pores, and thus the food in his stomach will be digested.” 
“Do they then seek the judgement of (the 
    days of) Ignorance? And who is better in judgement than Allaah for a people who have firm Faith?”
[al-Maa’idah 5:50 – interpretation of the 
    meaning]
Narrated by Ahmad, 18827; classed as saheeh 
    by Ibn Hibbaan, 16/443; and by Shaykh al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 1627. 
It was narrated from Anas that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said: “The believer in Paradise will be given such-and-such strength for intercourse.” It was said, “O Messenger of Allaah, will he really be able 
    to do that?” He said, “He will be given the strength of a hundred (men).”

Is there any evidence for this opinion?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    There are ahaadeeth among the saheeh Sunnahs which mention 
    the teaching of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    concerning looking at the place of prostration during prayer. These, in 
    general, include all the parts of the prayer, and perhaps these texts are 
    the ones that were quoted by the scholars of the Standing Committee and 
    quoted by them in the answer to question no. 
    8580. These texts include the 
    following: 

    Ibn Hibbaan (4/332) and al-Haakim (1/625) narrated that 
    ‘Aa’ishah said: “The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) entered the Ka’bah and his gaze did not go beyond the site of 
    his prostration until he came out.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in 
    Sifat Salaah al-Nabi  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 

    With regard to the reports of some of the salaf that were 
    quoted by ‘Abd al-Razaaq al-San’aani in al-Musannaf, these include 
    the following: 

    1 – It was narrated that Abu Qalaabah said: I asked Muslim 
    ibn Yassaar where should my gaze fall whilst I am praying? He said: If it 
    falls where you prostrate, that is good. 

    2 – It was narrated that Ibraaheem al-Nakha’i used to like 
    for the worshipper not to let his gaze wander beyond the place of 
    prostration. 

    3 – It was narrated that Ibn Sireen used to like for a man to 
    focus his gaze on the place of prostration. 

    Musannaf ‘Abd al-Razzaaq, 2/163 

    This is what the scholars of the Standing Committee said is 
    the view of the majority: Abu Haneefah, al-Shaafa’i and Ahmad. Some of them 
    made an exception in the case of the tashahhud, when the worshipper should 
    look at his finger. This is a sound exception, supported by reports in the 
    saheeh Sunnah. 

    It was narrated from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn al-Zubayr that when the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) “sat for the 
    Tashahhud, he would place his left hand on his left thigh and point with his 
    index finger, and would not let his gaze go beyond his finger.”  

    Narrated by Abu Dawood, 990; al-Nasaa’i, 1275; classed as 
    saheeh by al-Nawawi in Sharh Muslim. 5/81. He said: The Sunnah is not 
    to let one's gaze go beyond the pointing (finger). There is a saheeh hadeeth 
    concerning this in Sunan Abi Dawood.  

    Some of the scholars interpreted the verse in which Allaah 
    says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “so turn your face in the direction of Al-Masjid Al-Haraam 
    (at Makkah)”

    [al-Baqarah 2:144]

    as meaning that the worshipper should look straight ahead, 
    not at the place where he prostrates, but this is a less correct view. 

    Ibn Qudaamah said:  

    It is mustahabb for the worshipper to fix his gaze on the 
    place of prostration. Ahmad said – according to the report of Hanbal – : 
    Proper focus and humility (khushoo’) in prayer means that (the worshipper) 
    should fix his gaze on the place of prostration, this was narrated from 
    Muslim ibn Yasaar and Qataadah. 

    Al-Mughni, 1/370 

    Secondly: 

    In the saheeh Sunnah it is narrated that when the worshipper 
    bows, it is mustahabb for him not to raise his head or his gaze, rather they 
    should be level with his back. It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah said: The 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to 
    start his prayer with takbeer (saying Allaahu akbar), then he would recite
    al-hamdu Lillaahi Rabb il-‘Aalameen (i.e., al-Faatihah), and when he 
    bowed he would not raise or lower his head, rather it was somewhere between 
    the two.”  

    Narrated by Muslim, 498. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said, when he was explaining how rukoo’ 
    is to be done, that it is mustahabb for the person who is bowing to keep his 
    back in a straight line. 

    He said: With his back straight means that his back should be 
    kept straight throughout, when going down and when coming up; he should not 
    arch his back, or bend it in such a way that the middle comes down. Rather 
    his back should be straight. This is what has been narrated from the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). ‘Aa’ishah said: “When he 
    bowed, he did not either raise or lower his head,” – i.e., it was somewhere 
    in between the two.
