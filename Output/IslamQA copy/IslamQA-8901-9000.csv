Offering qiyam on Laylat al-Nisf min Sha’ban","Praise be to Allah.Laylat al-Nisf min Sha’ban (15th Shaban): Any Virtues?
Shaykh Ibn Jibrin said:
There is no sahih marfu’ report that speaks of the virtue of the middle of Sha’ban that may be followed, not even  in the chapters on al-Fadail (chapters on virtues in books of hadith etc.). Some maqtu’ reports (reports whose isnads do not go back further than the Tabi’in) have been narrated from some of the Tabi’in, and there are some hadiths, the best of which are mawdu’ (fabricated) or da’if jiddan (very weak). 
These reports became very well known in some countries which were overwhelmed by ignorance; these reports suggest that people’s lifespans are written on that day or that it is decided on that day who is to die in the coming year. 
On this basis, it is not prescribed to spend this night in prayer or to fast on this day, or to single it out for certain acts of worship. One should not be deceived by the large numbers of ignorant people who do these things. 
Offering qiyam on Laylat al-Nisf min Sha’ban
If a person wants to pray qiyam on laylat al-nisf min Sha’ban  as he does on other nights – without doing anything extra or singling this night out for anything – then that is OK. 
The same applies if he fasts the day of the fifteenth of Sha’ban because it happens to be one of the ayyam al-bid, along with the fourteenth and thirteenth of the month, or because it happens to be a Monday or Thursday. 
If the fifteenth (of Sha’ban) coincides with a Monday or Thursday, there is nothing wrong with that (fasting on that day), so long as he is not seeking extra reward that has not been proven (in the sahih texts).

Ruling on urinary incontinence


Going to mosques with offensive odours","Praise be to Allah.We ask Allah to heal our sister, and may Allah reward her with good for her keenness to understand the rulings of her religion and her not being shy to do so, so that she may clearly understand her religion. 
Doubts about breaking wudu
A person who is praying may sometimes imagine that he has passed wind whilst praying , when that has not in fact happened. This may be due to the whispering of the Shaytan who wants to spoil his prayer and make him not focus with proper humility in it. The worshipper should not stop praying unless he is certain that something has come out of him. 
It was narrated from ‘Abbad ibn Tamim that his paternal uncle asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about a man who thought he felt something whilst praying. He said: “He should not stop praying unless he hears a sound or detects an odour.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 137 (this version was narrated by him); Muslim 362) 
What is meant by the hadith is not that the ruling depends on hearing a sound or detecting an odour, rather what is meant is being certain that something has come out even if one does not hear a sound or detect an odour. (See Sharh Muslim by al-Nawawi, 4/49)
The basic principle concerning the worshipper is that if he has done wudu, then his wudu cannot be broken by something doubtful , rather he must be certain that he has broken it. If he is certain that he has broken his wudu, then he should stop praying and do wudu again. 
What breaks or invalidates wudu can only be that which comes out of the front of back passage for certain, so that one is sure of it and not doubtful or confused. Simply feeling that there is gas in one’s stomach is not one of the things that invalidate wudu, unless something comes out. 
Cases of urinary incontinence
The ruling on the gas of which you complain is the same as the rulings for those who suffer from istihadah (non-menstrual vaginal bleeding) or urinary incontinence. (al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 1/437) 
Two scenarios may apply: 
The first is: 
There may be a time when it stops, such as if you pass wind , then it stops for a while, during which time you can do wudu and pray, then it starts again. In this case you have to do wudu and pray during the time when it stops. 
The second is: 
It may be continuous and there may be no time when it stops; it could happen all the time. In this case you should do wudu for each prayer after the time for the prayer begins, and pray with this wudu; it does not matter whatever comes out of you even if that happens during wudu or during the prayer. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Whoever cannot keep his wudu for the duration of the prayer should do wudu and pray, and it does not matter what comes out of him during the prayer, and his wudu is not invalidated by that, according to the consensus of the imams. The most he has to do is to do wudu for each prayer.” (Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 21/221)
Ruling on urinary incontinence
The Standing Committee was asked about a man who suffers from urinary incontinence that appears for a short while after he urinates; if he waits for the urine to stop, the prayer in congregation will be over. What is the ruling? 
The Committee replied: 
“If he knows that the incontinence will stop, it is not permissible for him to pray in this condition seeking the virtue of the jama'ah. Rather he has to wait until it stops, then he should cleanse himself with water (istinja ) and pray, even if he has missed the prayer in congregation. He should hasten to cleanse himself with water and do wudu after the time for prayer begins, hoping that he will be able to offer the prayer in congregation.” 
It also says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah: 
“The basic principle concerning emission of wind is that it invalidates wudu, but if a person passes wind continually, he has to do wudu for each prayer when he wants to pray, then if wind comes out of him whilst he is praying, that does not invalidate it; he has to continue with his prayer until he completes it. This is a dispensation granted by Allah to make things easier for His slaves and not to cause them any hardship, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allah intends for you ease.” [al-Baqarah 2:185] 
“and has not laid upon you in religion any hardship.” [al-Hajj 22:78]” (al-Lajnah al-Daimah li’l-Buhuth, 5/411) 
Going to mosques with offensive odours 
With regard to your going to the mosque with this smell, that is not permissible because the mosques must be protected from all offensive odours, because that disturbs the worshippers, and it offends the noble angels. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade those who eat garlic or onions to come near the mosques. Al-Bukhari and Muslim narrated from Jabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever eats garlic or onions, let him keep away from us (or he said: let him keep away from our mosque) and sit in his house.” 
And Muslim (564) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever eats onions and garlic and leeks, let him not come near our mosque, for the angels are offended by that which offends the son of Adam.” 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to command that anyone on whom he detected the odour of garlic and onions be asked to leave the mosque. 
Muslim (567) narrated that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab said: I saw the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), if he detected the smell (of onions or garlic) on a man in the mosque, he would order that he be taken out to al-Baqi’ (the cemetery in al-Madinah).

8916,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/8916,Is a husband obliged to spend on his wife’s Hajj?,Is it 'Fardh'(obligatory) for a man to send his dependant wife to Hajj if the man is having enough money for the same?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not obligatory for a husband to bear the costs of his wife’s Hajj, even if he is rich. Rather it is mustahabb for him to do so and he will be rewarded for that, but he is not sinning if he does not do that. 
That is not enjoined by either the Qur’aan or the Sunnah. But Islam gives the wife the Mahr which is her exclusive right, and it permits her to dispose of her own wealth. 
Rather Islam enjoins on the husband to spend on his wife in a manner that is good and reasonable, but it does not oblige him to pay off her debts, or to pay zakaah on her behalf, or to pay the costs of Hajj etc. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was asked: will a husband be rewarded if he appoints someone to do Hajj on his wife’s behalf, if she dies without having done Hajj? 
He said: it is better for him to do Hajj on her behalf himself so that the rituals will be done properly… Then he said: But as for it being obligatory, that is not obligatory for him. 
Al-Liqa’ al-Shahri, 34, no. 579 
Just as it is not obligatory to make up Hajj on her behalf after she dies, so too it is not obligatory for him to pay for her Hajj whilst she is still alive. 
This is as far as the issue of whether or not it is obligatory is concerned. With regard to being kind to her, if he does that then Allah does not cause the reward of those who do good to be lost, and Allah will record for him the reward of her Hajj. 
The fuqaha’ (may Allah have mercy on them) stated that it is obligatory for a husband to spend on his wife’s Hajj in the event that he deliberately spoils her Hajj, such as one who forces his wife to have intercourse before the first stage of exiting ihram, etc. 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-Kareem Zaydaan said: 
It is not one of the wife’s rights over the husband that he should bear the costs of her Hajj, or share the costs with her. 
Al-Mufassal fi Ahkaam al-Mar’ah, 2/177 
Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about the same issue and he replied: It is not obligatory for a husband to pay the expenses of his wife’s Hajj. This has to do with men. If a woman has sufficient money to go for Hajj then it is obligatory for her to go for Hajj; if she does not have enough money then she is not obliged to go for Hajj.

Is it obligatory to pray in congregation in the mosque?


Evidence for the obligation to pray in congregation in the mosque","Praise be to Allah.We praise Allah for guiding you to the religion of Islam. This is a great blessing for which Allah should be praised and thanked. 
Prayer is the greatest of the pillars of Islam
The Muslim has to understand that prayer is the greatest of the pillars of Islam, and that it is the thing which distinguishes a Muslim from a non-Muslim, as it says in the hadith of Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “Between a man and shirk and kufr there stands his giving up prayer.” (Narrated by Muslim, 82) 
Is it obligatory to pray in congregation in the mosque?
The jurists (may Allah have mercy on them) differed concerning the ruling on congregational prayers. There are a number of opinions, the most sound of which is that prayer in congregation in the mosque is obligatory and this is what is indicated by the Shar`i evidence.
This is the view of ‘Ata ibn Abi Rabah, al-Hasan al-Basri, al-Awza’i and Abi Thawr, and of Imam Ahmad as it appears from some of his statements. This was also stated by al-Shafi`i in Mukhtasar al-Muzni where he said: “With regard to praying in congregation , I do not allow a concession to anyone not to do it except one who has an excuse.” This was also the view favoured by Shaykh Ibn Baz and Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on them). 
Evidence for the obligation to pray in congregation in the mosque
With regard to the evidence that it is obligatory, it is as follows: 

Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“When you (O Messenger Muhammad) are among them, and lead them in As-Salah (the prayer), let one party of them stand up [in Salah (prayer)] with you taking their arms with them; when they finish their prostrations, let them take their positions in the rear and let the other party come up which have not yet prayed, and let them pray with you” [al-Nisa 4:102]
Ibn al-Mundhir said: 
“The fact that Allah has commanded us to establish prayer in congregation even at times of fear indicates that doing so at times of security is even more obligatory.” (Al-Awsat, 4/135) 
Ibn al-Qayyim said: 
“There are several ways in which this verse may be taken as evidence: 
Firstly, Allah commands them to pray in congregation, then He repeats the command with regard to the second group, by saying “and let the other party come up which have not yet prayed, and let them pray with you”. This indicates that praying in congregation is obligatory on an individual basis, as Allah did not excuse the second group because the first group had done it. If praying in congregation was Sunnah, the best excuse for not doing it would be the excuse of fear. If it were fard kifayah (a communal obligation), it would no longer be obligatory after the first group had done it. So this verse proves that it is obligatory for each and every individual. So these are the three ways in which this verse proves it is obligatory: Allah commands it once, then He commands it again, and He does not allow them a concession not to do it at times of fear.” (Al-Salah wa Hukm Tarikiha, p. 137, 138) 

Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“And perform As-Salah (Iqamat-as-Salah), and give Zakah, and bow down (or submit yourselves with obedience to Allah) along with Ar-Raki‘un (those who bow)” [al-Baqarah 2:43]
The way in which this verse may be taken as evidence is that here Allah commanded them to bow, which refers to prayer. Prayer is described as ruku’ (bowing) here because bowing is one of the pillars or essential parts of the prayer, and prayer is sometimes referred to by its pillars and obligatory components, as Allah calls it sujud (prostration), Quran and Tasbih (glorification of Allah). And the phrase “along with Ar-Raki‘un (those who bow)” cannot mean anything other than doing it with a congregation of worshippers. This is what the word ma’a (with) means. Once this is understood, if a command mentions a particular manner or situation, then the one who is commanded to do it cannot obey the command properly unless he does it in the manner or situation mentioned. Some may argue that Allah says  (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O Maryam! Submit yourself with obedience to your Lord (Allah, by worshipping none but Him Alone) and prostrate yourself, and bow down along with Ar-Raki‘un (those who bow down)” [Al ‘Imran 3:43]
But this does not mean that women have to attend prayers in congregation . It was said that this verse does not imply that this is enjoined upon all women, rather this was something that applied only to Maryam, unlike the words “And perform As-Salah (Iqamat-as-Salah), and give Zakah, and bow down (or submit yourselves with obedience to Allah) along with Ar-Raki‘un (those who bow)”. 
Maryam was a unique case, unlike other women, because her mother had vowed that she would be sacred to Allah and devoted to His worship; she would stay in the place of worship and not leave it. So she was commanded to bow with the people in the place of worship. When Allah chose her and purified her and chose her above all the women of the world, He commanded her to obey Him in ways that were unique to her and did not apply to other women. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And (remember) when the angels said: “O Maryam (Mary)! Verily, Allah has chosen you, purified you (from polytheism and disbelief), and chosen you above the women of the ‘Alamin (mankind and jinn) (of her lifetime).” O Mary! “Submit yourself with obedience to your Lord (Allah, by worshipping none but Him Alone) and prostrate yourself, and bow down along with Ar-Raki‘un (those who bow down)”  [Al ‘Imran 3:42-43]
Some say that the fact that they were commanded to bow with those who bow does not indicate that it is obligatory to bow with them at the time when they are bowing, rather it indicates that one should do as they do, as in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Fear Allah, and be with those who are true (in words and deeds)” [al-Tawbah 9:119]
They further argue that the word ma’a (with) means doing the same as they do, but it does not necessarily mean doing it at the same time. The answer is that in Arabic, the word ma’a means more than doing the same as someone else, rather it means doing it with them, especially in the case of prayer. If someone says “Go and pray with the congregation ” or “I prayed with the congregation”, the only interpretation can be that he went and joined them and prayed together with them.” (Al-Salah wa Hukm Tarikiha, 139-141) 

Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, I was thinking of ordering that wood be gathered, then I would have ordered that the call to prayer be given, then I would have told a man to lead the people in prayer, then I would have gone from behind and burned the houses of men who did not attend the (congregational) prayer down around them. By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, if any one of them had known that he would get a bone covered with good meat or two sheep’s feet with meat in them, he would have turned up for the ‘Isha prayer.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 618; Muslim, 651 

Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The most burdensome prayers for the hypocrites are ‘Isha and Fajr.  If they knew what (reward) is in them, they would come to them even if they had to crawl. I was thinking of ordering that the call to prayer be given, then I would tell a man to lead the people in prayer, and I would go out with men carrying bundles of wood to people who do not come to the prayers, and I would burn their houses with fire around them.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 626; Muslim, 651)
Ibn al-Mundhir said: 
“The fact that he was thinking of burning down the houses of people who stayed behind and did not attend the prayers is the clearest indication that it is obligatory to pray in congregation, because it would not have been permissible for the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to burn down the houses of those who stayed behind if prayer in congregation was only something good but not obligatory.” (Al-Awsat, 4/134) 
Al-San’ani said: 
“This hadith indicates that prayer in congregation is an individual obligation, not a communal one, because if it was a communal obligation and some had done it, why would others have deserved the punishment? There is no punishment except for one who neglects an obligatory duty or does something that is haram.” (Subul al-Salam, 2/18, 19) 

Abu Hurayrah said: A blind man [Ibn Umm Maktum] came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, “O Messenger of Allah, I have no one to lead me to the mosque,” and he asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to grant him a concession allowing him to pray in his house, and he allowed him that. But when he turned away he said, “Can you hear the call to prayer?” He said, “Yes.” He said, “Then answer it.” According to a version narrated by Abu Dawud (552) and Ibn Majah (792) he said: “I do not think there is any concession for you.” 

Al-Nawawi said concerning this hadith: “Its chain of transmission is sound or good.” (Al-Majmu’, 4/164)
Ibn al-Mundhir said: 
“If there is no concession for a blind man, then it is more appropriate that there should be no concession for one who can see.” (Al-Awsat, 4/134)
 Ibn Qudamah said: 
“If there is no concession for a blind man who had no one to lead him, it is more appropriate that there should be no concession for others.”  
Al-Mughni, 2/3

Ibn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Whoever would like to meet Allah tomorrow as a Muslim, let him regularly perform these prayers when the call for them is given, for they are among the ways of guidance. Allah has prescribed for your Prophet ways of guidance, and if you pray in your homes, as this one who stays away from the prayers prays in his home, then you will have abandoned the way of your Prophet, and if you abandon the way of your Prophet you will go astray. There is no man who purifies himself and does it well, then he goes to one of these mosques, but for every step he takes, Allah will record for him one good deed and will raise him thereby one degree in status, and will erase for him one bad deed. I saw us (at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)) and no one stayed behind from these prayers except a hypocrite who was known for his hypocrisy. A man would come supported by two others so that he could stand in the row. 

According to another version, he said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught us the ways of guidance, and told us that one of the ways of guidance is to pray in the mosque when the call to prayer is given. (Narrated by Muslim, 654) 
Ibn al-Qayyim said: 
“What we may conclude from this is that he described staying away from the prayers as one of the signs of the hypocrites who are known for their hypocrisy. The signs of hypocrisy are not omitting mustahabb actions or doing makruh things. Whoever seeks to learn the signs of hypocrisy according to the Sunnah will find that they are omitting obligatory actions or doing haram things. This is supported by the fact that he said: “Whoever would like to meet Allah tomorrow as a Muslim, let him regularly perform these prayers when the call for them is given”. And he described the one who stays away and offers the prayers at home as being one who has abandoned the Sunnah which is the path of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the laws that he prescribed for his ummah. What is meant is not the Sunnah which those who wish can do and those who do not wish can omit, because omitting that is not misguidance or a sign of hypocrisy – such as not praying Duha and qiyam al-layl, or fasting on Mondays and Thursdays.” (Al-Salah wa Hukm Tarikiha, p. 146, 147) 

The consensus of the Companions 

Ibn al-Qayyim said: 
“There was consensus among the Companions and we will quote what they said: 
We have mentioned the words of Ibn Mas’ud above: “I saw us (at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)) and no one stayed behind from these prayers except a hypocrite who was known for his hypocrisy.” 
It was also narrated that Ibn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Whoever hears the muadhdhin and does not respond with no excuse, his prayer is not valid.” 
Abu Musa al-Ash’ari said: “Whoever hears the muadhdhin and does not respond with no excuse, his prayer is not valid.” 
`Ali said: “There is no prayer for a neighbour of the mosque except in the mosque.” It was said, “Who is the neighbour of the mosque?” He said, “Whoever can hear the muadhdhin.” 
Al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Whoever hears the call to prayer and does not come, his prayer does not go beyond his head, except for one who has an excuse.” 
`Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Whoever among the neighbours of the mosque hears the call to prayer, and he is in good health and does not have any excuse, his prayer is not valid.” (Al-Salah wa Hukm Tarikiha, p/ 153) 
There is a great deal of evidence, but what we have quoted above is sufficient. You can refer to the book by Ibn al-Qayyim, al-Salah wa Hukm Tarikiha (Prayer and the Ruling on one who abandons it), which has a lot more information. Shaykh Ibn Baz wrote a useful essay entitled Wujub Ada al-Salah fi Jama’ah (The obligation of offering prayers in congregation).

          and he said, “I have only been commanded to do wudoo’ when I intend

          as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan al-Tirmidhi, hadeeth 
          no. 1506). This hadeeth indicates that it is not obligatory to do wudoo’ 
          except when one intends to pray. But there are actions for which it 
          is mustahabb to do wudoo’, such as reading Qur’aan, when going to sleep, 
          etc.  
It should be noted that it is permissible 
          for a person to offer several prayers with one wudoo’, so long as he

          Makkah, the Prophet  (peace and

          in which he had wiped over his socks. ‘Umar said, “I saw you do something 
          which you had never done.” He said, “I did that deliberately, O ‘Umar.” 
          (Narrated by Muslim, al-Tahaarah, 415).  
Imaam al-Nawawi said in his commentary on 
          Saheeh Muslim, this hadeeth indicates that it is permissible 
          to offer the obligatory (fard) and supererogatory (naafil) prayers with 
          one wudoo’, so long as it is not broken. This is permissible according

8928,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/8928,Is it permissible to call upon a dead wali (“saint”) or Hazrat ‘Ali,"forgive me, I have more than 1 question.
1. Is the Prophet Sallalahu Alaihe Wasallam or any other being apart from Allah Omnipresent?
2. Can we call on anyone in times of need ie. a dead saint or Hazrat Ali Radialahahu anhu etc?
Please could you quote the relevent Hadith and Quran Ayahs",,,"Praise be to Allah.First of all, we must comment on your saying in your question, “or any other being apart from Allah…” We must point out that this wording is wrong, because it may be taken as meaning that you think that Allah is a created being; but we are sure that you do not believe that.
Firstly:
Allah said to His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him):
“Verily, you (O Muhammad) will die, and verily, they (too) will die” [al-Zumar 39:30]  
And Allah said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Muhammad is no more than a Messenger, and indeed (many) Messengers have passed away before him. If he dies or is killed, will you then turn back on your heels (as disbelievers)?” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:144]
“And We granted not to any human being immortality before you (O Muhammad); then if you die, would they live forever? [al-Anbiyaa’ 21:34]  
Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) said, in his speech after the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had died, “Whoever used to worship Muhammad, Muhammad has died, but whoever used to worship Allah, Allah is Alive and will never die.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari).
This and similar evidence indicates that Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was a human being like all other human beings, who died as they die, and will never be immortal just as no one before him was immortal.
Whoever wants to put the Prophet beyond the human realm and claim that the Prophet is present in all places, is the one who should be asked to produce evidence (daleel). How does he know that the Prophet is omnipresent at all times? Moreover, those who make the same claim with regard to Allah (should know that) this is kufr, deviation and misguidance. This belief implies that Allah is present even in dirty places like bathrooms etc. – Glorified be Allah far above what they say.
Secondly:
-You have to read the book Fath al-Majeed Sharh Kitaab al-Tawheed, by Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Hasan.
-Know that du’aa’ and asking for help are forms of worship, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And your Lord said: ‘Invoke Me [i.e. believe in My Oneness (Islamic Monotheism) and ask Me for anything] I will respond to your (invocation). Verily, those who scorn My worship [i.e. do not invoke Me, and do not believe in My Oneness, (Islamic Monotheism)] they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!’” [Ghaafir 40:60]
And according to a report narrated by al-Tirmidhi, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Du’aa’ is worship.”
 So it is not permissible to offer du’aa’ to or call upon anyone except Allah. But the evidence indicates that it is permissible to ask another person for some things, but that is subject to two conditions : 
1-That it should be something possible and the person should be able to do it, such as asking a person to give you money when you are in need of it. But if it is something that he is not able to do, then it is not permissible for you to ask him, such as asking a man to let you be one of the people of Paradise, because he is not able to do that even if he is a righteous and pious man.
2-The person who is asked should be capable, such as one who is alive. It is not permissible to call upon the dead, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And those, whom you invoke or call upon instead of Him, own not even a Qitmeer (the thin membrane over the date stone).
If you invoke (or call upon) them, they hear not your call; and if (in case) they were to hear, they could not grant it (your request) to you [Faatir 35:13-14]",Shaykh Sa’d al-Humayd
8929,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/8929,What Is Belief in the Messengers?,What is meant by belief in the Messengers?,"Belief in the Messengers implies: 1- Firm belief that Allah sent to every nation a messenger to call them to worship Allah Alone, 2- Belief in those messengers whose names we know, such as Muhammad, Ibrahim, Musa, ‘Isa and Nuh, 3- Believing in the sound reports that have been narrated from the messengers, and 4- Following the laws of the messenger who has been sent to us, namely the Final Prophet, Muhammad, who was sent to all of mankind.","What is belief in the Messengers?


Greatest blessings given Prophet Muhammad


Why do we believe in the messengers?","Praise be to Allah.What is belief in the Messengers?
Belief in the Messengers implies four things:

Firm belief that Allah sent to every nation a messenger from amongst them, to call them to worship Allah Alone and to disbelieve in everything that is worshipped instead of Him, and that they (the messengers) were all truthful, speakers of the truth, righteous, wise, pious and honest, and that they conveyed everything with which Allah sent them, concealing and altering nothing. They did not add even one letter from themselves or omit anything. 

“Are the messengers charged with anything but to clearly convey the Message?” [Al-Nahl 16:35 – interpretation of the meaning]
Their message was the same , from the first to the last of them, based on the principle of Tawhid, i.e., that all kinds of worship should be devoted to Allah Alone, beliefs, words and deeds alike, and that everything that is worshipped instead of Allah is to be rejected. The evidence for that is the verses (interpretation of the meanings): 
“And We did not send any messenger before you (O Muhammad) but We revealed to him (saying): La ilaha illa Ana [none has the right to be worshipped but I (Allah)], so worship Me (Alone and none else).”[Al-Anbiya 21:25]
“And ask (O Muhammad) those of Our messengers whom We sent before you: ‘Did We ever appoint alihah (gods) to be worshipped besides the Most Gracious (Allah)?’.” [Al-Zukhruf 43:45]
And there are very many similar verses. 
With regard to the obligatory duties by which Allah is to be worshipped and the minor details of legislation, prayers and fasts may have been enjoined on some nations but not on others, and some things may have been forbidden to some and permitted to others, as a test from Allah. 
 “Who has created death and life that He may test you which of you is best in deed.” [Al-Mulk 67:2 – interpretation of the meaning]
The evidence for that is in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“To each among you, We have prescribed a law and a clear way.” [Al-Maidah 5:48]
Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said “(This means) a way and a path.” Mujahid, ‘Ikrimah and many of the mufassirin (commentators) said likewise. 
In Sahih al-Bukhari (3443) and Sahih Muslim (2365) it is narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘The prophets are like brothers from one father, their mothers are different but their religion is one’” – i.e., the prophets are united on the principle of Tawhid, the message with which Allah sent every messenger whom He sent, and which He included in every Book that He revealed, but their laws differed as to command and prohibitions, what was permitted and what was forbidden.  
Whoever disbelieves in the message of one of them has disbelieved in all of them, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The people of Nuh (Noah) belied the Messengers.” [Al-Shu’ara 26:105]
Allah described them as disbelieving in all of the Messengers even though there was no Messenger other than Nuh at the time when they disbelieved. 

Belief in those messengers whose names we know, such as Muhammad, Ibrahim, Musa, ‘Isa and Nuh (may blessings and peace be upon them all). With regard to those who have been mentioned in general terms but whose names we do not know, we are obliged to believe in them in general terms, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“The Messenger (Muhammad) believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers. Each one believes in Allah, His Angels, His Books, and His Messengers. (They say,) ‘We make no distinction between one another of His messengers’.” [Al-Baqarah 2:285]
“And, indeed We have sent messengers before you (O Muhammad), of some of them We have related to you their story. And of some We have not related to you their story.” [Ghafir 40:78]
And we believe that the Final messenger was our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and there is no prophet after him, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but he is the Messenger of Allah and the last (end) of the prophets. And Allah is Ever All-Aware of everything.” [Al-Ahzab 33:40]
In al-Bukhari (4416) and Muslim (2404), it is narrated from Sa’d ibn Abi Waqqas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went out to Tabuk, and appointed ‘Ali as his deputy (in Madinah). ‘Ali said, “Are you leaving me in charge of the children and women?” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Does it not please you that you are to me like Harun to Musa? But there will be no prophet after me.” 
Greatest blessings given Prophet Muhammad
Allah favoured Prophet Muhammad and singled him out for great blessings which were given to no other prophet. For example: 

Allah sent Prophet Muhammad to all of the two races of mankind and jinn, whereas each Prophet who came before him was sent only to his own people.
Allah supported him against his enemies by striking fear into the hearts of all his enemies within the radius of one month’s travel.
The earth was made a place of prayer and a means of purification for him.
War booty was made permissible for him, where it had not been permitted to any prophet before him.
He will be granted the position of greater intercession.

And there are many other special favours that have been bestowed upon him (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 

Believing in the sound reports that have been narrated from the messengers. 
Following the laws of the messenger who has been sent to us, namely the Final Prophet, Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who was sent to all of mankind. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you (O Muhammad) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission.” [Al-Nisa 4:65]
Why do we believe in the messengers?
We should note that belief in the messengers bears great fruit, such as: 

Knowledge of the mercy of Allah towards His slaves and His care for them, as He sent the messengers to guide them to the path of Allah and to show them how to worship Allah, for human reason alone cannot come to know that.
Giving thanks to Him for this great blessing.
Loving and venerating the messengers (blessing and peace be upon them), and praising them in the manner that befits them, because they are the messengers of Allah, and because they worshipped Him and conveyed His Message, and were sincere towards His slaves.

    evil actions in one's heart","What is meant by denouncing evil actions
      in one's heart?",,,"Praise be to Allah.When we speak of denouncing evil actions with the heart, it refers to two things, when and how. 
With regard to when: this is done when the Muslim is unable to take action or speak out against the evil action, but he is aware of the conditions and guidelines of al-amr bil-maroof wan-nahy an al-munkar (enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil). The basic principle concerning this is the hadeeth narrated by Imaam Muslim in his Saheeh which he attributes to the Prophet 
(peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): Whoever among you sees an evil action, then let him change it with his hand [by taking action]; if he cannot, then with his tongue [by speaking out]; and if he cannot, then with his heart  and that is the weakest of faith. So this answers the question of when. As for how: it means that the believer feels in his heart that he hates and detests this evil action, and he wishes that he were able to change it, and feels sad that he is unable to change this evil action. This last point is one of the signs of one's sincerity in denouncing the evil action in ones heart. The person should also ask
Allaah to help him change and eradicate this evil. We ask Allaah to help us and all the believers to develop this blessed attitude. It should also be pointed out that a person may be unable to change an evil action, but he can still keep away from the places where that sin is being committed. Indeed, he has to keep away; it is not enough only to denounce the evil in one's heart. Allaah says (interpretation of the meanings): And when you (Muhammad) see those who engage in a false
    conversation about Our Verses (of the Quraan) by mocking at them, stay away from
    them till they turn to another topic. And if Shaitaan (Satan) causes you to forget, then
    after the remembrance sit not you in the company of those people who are the Zaalimoon
    (polytheists and wrongdoers). (al-Anaam 6:68)
And it has already been revealed to you in the Book (this Quraan) that when you hear the Verses of Allaah being denied and mocked at, then sit not with them, until they engage in a talk other than that; (but if you stayed with them)
certainly in that case you would be like them. Surely, Allaah will collect the hypocrites and disbelievers all together in Hell (al-Nisaa 4:140) May Allaah bless our Prophet and all his family and companions, and grant them peace.",Answer to a question from the Islamic Net site

If he is an angel, then how is it he disobeyed Allah, when angels have no will of their own and follow only Allah's command? If he is really a jinni, then it would better explain his disobedience as then he actually had the choice to obey or disobey Allah. I would appreciate a response, even if it is a brief one.","Iblis was not an angel for a single day, not even for an instant. He is one of the jinn. The angels were created noble; they never disobey Allah when He commands them to do something.","Was Iblis an angel?


Evidence from Quran that Iblis was not an angel


Response to the view that Iblis was an angel","Praise be to Allah.Was Iblis an angel?
Iblis – may Allah curse him – is one of the jinn. He was not an angel for a single day, not even for an instant. The angels were created noble; they never disobey Allah when He commands them to do something and they do what they are commanded. 
Evidence from Quran that Iblis was not an angel
This is clearly stated in the Quranic texts which indicate that Iblis is one of the jinn and not one of the angels. These texts include the following:
·        Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And (remember) when We said to the angels: “Prostrate yourselves unto Adam.” So they prostrated themselves except Iblis (Satan). He was one of the jinn; he disobeyed the command of his Lord. Will you then take him (Iblis) and his offspring as protectors and helpers rather than Me while they are enemies to you? What an evil is the exchange for the Zalimun (polytheists, and wrongdoers, etc).” [18:50]
·        Allah stated that He created the jinn from fire, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And the jinn, We created aforetime from the smokeless flame of fire” [15:27]
“And the jinn He created from a smokeless flame of fire” [55:15]
‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The angels were created from light, the jinn were created from smokeless fire and Adam was created from that which has been described to you.” [Muslim, Ahmad, al-Bayhaqi and Ibn Hibban]
One of the attributes of the angels is that they were created from light, and the jinn were created from fire. It was mentioned in the Quran that Iblis – may Allah curse him – was created from fire. This is what Iblis himself said when Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, asked him the reason for his refusal to prostrate to Adam when Allah commanded him to do so. He – may Allah curse him – said:
“‘I am better than him (Adam), You created me from fire, and him You created from clay.’” [7:12, 38:76 – interpretation of the meaning]. This indicates that he was one of the jinn.
·        Allah has described the angels in His Book, where He says (interpretation of the meaning):
“O you who believe! Ward off yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones, over which are (appointed) angels stern (and) severe, who disobey not, (from executing) the commands they receive from Allah, but do that which they are commanded.” [66:6]
“And they say: ‘The Most Gracious (Allah) has begotten a son (or children).’ Glory to Him! They [whom they call children of Allah i.e. the angels, ‘Isa (Jesus) son of Maryam, ‘Uzair (Ezra)], are but honoured slaves. They speak not until He has spoken, and they act on His command.” [21:26-27]
“And to Allah prostrate all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth, of the moving (living) creatures and the angels, and they are not proud [i.e. they worship their Lord (Allah) with humility]. They fear their Lord above them, and they do what they are commanded.” [16:49-50]
So it is not possible for the angels to disobey their Lord, because they are protected from sin and they are naturally inclined to obey Allah.
·        The fact that Iblis is not one of the angels means that he is not compelled to obey Allah. He has freedom of will just as we humans do. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Verily, We showed him the way, whether he be grateful or ungrateful.” [76:3]
There are also Muslims and non-Muslims among the jinn. It says in Surah al-Jinn (interpretation of the meaning):
“Say (O Muhammad): ‘It has been revealed to me that a group (from three to ten in number) of jinn listened (to this Quran). They said: ‘Verily, we have heard a wonderful Recitation (this Quran)! It guides to the right path, and we have believed therein, and we shall never join (in worship) anything with our Lord (Allah).’” [72:1-2]
In the same chapter, it states that the jinn said:
“‘And indeed when we heard the Guidance (this Quran), we believed therein (Islamic Monotheism), and whosoever believes in his Lord shall have no fear, either of a decrease in the reward of his good deeds or an increase in the punishment for his sins.  And of us some are Muslims (who have submitted to Allah, after listening to this Quran), and of us some are Al-Qasitun (disbelievers those who have deviated from the right path)…” [72:13-14]
Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his exegesis:
Al-Hasan al-Basri said: Iblis was not one of the angels, not even for a single moment. He is the father of the jinn, just as Adam (peace be upon him) is the father of mankind. This was narrated by al-Tabari with a sahih isnad (authentic chain).
Response to the view that Iblis was an angel
Some of the scholars said that Iblis was one of the angels , that he was the peacock of the angels, that he was the one among the angels who strove the hardest in worship … and other reports, most of which come from the Israiliyyat (stories and reports from Jewish sources), and some of which contradict the clear texts of the Quran.
Ibn Kathir said, explaining this:
“A lot of these reports were transmitted from the salaf (pious predecessors), and most of them come from the Israiliyyat, which may have been transmitted in order to be examined [i.e., as opposed to being accepted as is]. Allah knows best about the veracity or otherwise of many of them. Some of them are definitely to be rejected, because they go against the truth which we hold in our hands. In the Quran we have what is sufficient so that we have no need for previous reports, because hardly any of them are free of distortions, with things added or taken away. Many things have been fabricated in them, for they did not have people who had memorized things precisely by heart (huffaz) who could eliminate the distortions created by extremists and fabricators, unlike this ummah (nation) which has its imams (religious leaders), scholars, masters, pious and righteous people, brilliant critics and men of excellent memory who recorded the hadiths (reports) and classified them, stating whether they were sahih (sound), hasan (good), da’if (weak), mawdu’ (fabricated) or matruk (to be ignored). They identified the fabricators and liars, and those about whom nothing was known, and other kinds of men (i.e., narrators). All of this afforded protection to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), the seal of the Messengers and the leader of Mankind, so that nothing would be attributed to him falsely and nothing would be transmitted from him that he did not say or do. May Allah be pleased with them and make them pleased [by rewarding them], and make the Paradise of al-Firdaws their eternal abode.” (Tafsir al-Quran il-‘Azim).

Did any such incident occur in the days of The Holy Prophet(P.B.U.H) and how was it dealt with?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.One of the gravest of major sins with which a person can meet his Lord is the sin of killing a soul whose killing Allaah has forbidden. 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And whoever kills a believer intentionally, his recompense is Hell to abide therein; and the Wrath and the Curse of Allaah are upon him, and a great punishment is prepared for him”
[al-Nisa’ 4:93]
It was narrated that Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was asked about major sins, and he said: “Associating others with Allaah, disobeying one’s parents, murder and bearing false witness.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2510; Muslim, 88. 
It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The believer will continue to have a good chance of salvation so long as he does not shed haraam blood.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6469. 
It is not permissible to accuse chaste women of zina. Zina can only be proven by the testimony of four men who see the act take place with their own eyes, and see the penis enter the vagina, or by the unforced confession of the man or woman who committed zina. 
Anything other than that is accusing a Muslim woman of zina, for which the person should be given eighty lashes. 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And those who accuse chaste women, and produce not four witnesses, flog them with eighty stripes, and reject their testimony forever. They indeed are the Faasiqoon (liars, rebellious, disobedient to Allaah)”
[al-Noor 24:4]
It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah and Zayd ibn Khaalid al-Juhani (may Allaah be pleased with them both) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “… Go tomorrow, O Unays, to this woman and if she admits (to adultery) then stone her.” He said: I went to her the next day and she admitted it, so the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) ordered that she be stoned.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2575; Muslim, 1698. 
Allaah has specified the punishments for men and women who commit zina. The hadd punishment is stoning if they have been married and one hundred lashes for one who has not been previously married. 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The fornicatress and the fornicator, flog each of them with a hundred stripes. Let not pity withhold you in their case, in a punishment prescribed by Allaah, if you believe in Allaah and the Last Day. And let a party of the believers witness their punishment”
[al-Noor 24:2]
It was narrated from Jaabir that a man from (the tribe of) Aslam came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when he was in the mosque and he said, “I have committed adultery.”  The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) turned his face away from him. The man came to that side to which the Prophet had turned his face, and testified against himself four times. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, ""Are you mad?” He said, “No.” The Prophet said, “Are you married?"" He said, ""Yes.” So he commanded that he be stoned in the Musalla (Eid prayer place). When the stones troubled him, he ran away, until he was caught in al-Harrah and killed.  
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4969; Muslim, 1691. 
If it is asked: who is it that should carry out this hadd punishment for zina? 
The answer is: 
No one should carry out the hadd punishments without the permission of the ruler. If there is no ruler who rules according to sharee’ah then it is not permissible for the ordinary people to carry out the hadd punishments. Whoever does that is sinning, because carrying out the hadd punishments requires examining the matter and requires shar’i knowledge in order to know the conditions of proof. 
The ordinary people have no knowledge of such things, and the carrying out of one of the hadd punishments by the ordinary people leads to many evils and the loss of security, whereby people will attack one another and kill one another or chop off one another’s hands on the grounds that they are carrying out hadd punishments. 
Al-Qurtubi said: 
There is no dispute among the scholars that qisaas (retaliatory punishments) such as execution cannot be carried out except by those in authority who are obliged to carry out the qisaas and carry out hadd punishments etc, because Allaah has addressed the command regarding qisaas to all the Muslims, and it is not possible for all the Muslims to get together to carry out the qisaas, which is why they appointed a leader who may represent them in carrying out the qisaas and hadd punishments. 
Tafseer al-Qurtubi, 2/245, 246. 
Ibn Rushd al-Qurtubi said: 
With regard to the one who should carry out this punishment – i.e., the hadd punishment for drinking alcohol – they agreed that the ruler should carry it out, and that applies to all the hadd punishments. 
Bidaayat al-Mujtahid, 2/233. 
Al-Shawkaani said: 
It was narrated from Abu’l-Zinaad from his father that the fuqaha’ of the people of Madeenah used to say that no one should carry out any of the hadd punishments except the ruler, unless it is a man carrying out the hadd punishment for zina on his male or female slave. Nayl al-Awtaar, 7/295, 296. 
The family of the woman should prevent her from committing immoral actions and should prevent the things that lead to that, such as going out, speaking to non-mahram men, and everything that may enable her to commit evil. If the only way is to detain her and tie her up, then they have the right to do that, so they should detain her in the house. 
But as for killing her, they should not do that. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about a married woman who had children and who formed an attachment to a man and committed immoral actions with him. When she was found out, she tried to leave her husband: did she have any right to her children after doing this? Was there any sin on them if they cut off relations with her? Was it permissible for the one who has proof of that to kill her secretly? If someone else did that would he be sinning? 
He replied: 
Her sons’ and male relatives’ duty is to prevent her from committing haraam actions, and if the only way they could do that is by detaining her, then they should detain her. If it means that they have to tie her up, then they should tie her up. But the son should not beat his mother, and with regard to treating her kindly, they have no right to do otherwise. It is not permissible for them to cut off ties with her so that she is free to do evil actions, rather they should try to prevent her from doing evil as much as possible. If she needs provision and clothing they should provide that for her. And it is not permissible for them to carry out the hadd punishment – execution or otherwise – on her, and they will be sinning if they do that. 
Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 34/177-178. 
It so happened that some women committed zina at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and no one in their families killed any of these women. One of them was al-Ghaamidiyyah (may Allaah be pleased with her). 
It was narrated that Buraydah ibn al-Haseeb said: A woman from Ghaamid, a branch of al-Azd, came and said: “O Messenger of Allaah, purify me!” He said, “Woe to you! Go back and seek the forgiveness of Allaah and repent to Him.” She said: “I think that you intend to send me back as you sent Maa’iz ibn Maalik back.” He said, “What has happened to you?” She said that she had become pregnant as a result of zina. He said: “Is it you (who has done that)?”  She said: “Yes.” He said to her: “(You will not be punished) until you give birth to that which is in your womb.” A man from among the Ansaar sponsored her [i.e., paid for her needs etc] until she delivered (the child). Then he (that Ansaari) came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: “The Ghaamidi woman has given birth to a child.” He (the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)) said: “Then we will not stone her and so leave her child with no one to nurse him.” One of the Ansaar stood up and said: “O Messenger of Allaah, let me be responsible for ensuring that he is nursed.” Then she was stoned to death. 
Narrated by Muslim, 1695. 
So the attitude of the family of the woman asked about here, claiming that she deserves to be executed, is wrong in other ways as well, such as: 
1 – They do not have the attitude if one of their sons or brothers commits zina. This is like the actions of the people of the Jaahiliyyah who allowed themselves to commit zina but not their women. And these people feel that their honour has been besmirched and their protective jealousy comes to the for if their women commit sin, but there is no protective jealousy on their part if one of their sons or brothers does the same thing. Indeed some fathers boast about their son’s evil actions and encourage him to do it.
2 – They have opened the door for women to fall into sin, by allowing women to attend mixed schools, have bad friends, watch haraam things and sit in reprehensible gatherings. This has led to women’s hearts becoming deadened and attracted to immoral things. Some of them do not arrange marriages for their daughters or sisters and they stipulate impossible conditions, then they want to punish them when they are the ones who deserve punishment more. 
3 – They don’t only kill for the sin of zina, rather they do that even if the woman only spoke to or got to know a non-mahram man, for which there is no hadd punishment of killing in sharee’ah. 
4 – They open the door for everyone who wants to kill his sister or daughter on the grounds of nonsensical excuses, when the reason for killing her may be her wealth, or because she knows things about them that they want to conceal, or other such reasons. 
From time to time we hear claims from the kaafir west or the deviant east that everyone who kills his sister or daughter does so because of honour. That is because many laws let the killer off if he kills any family member for this reason. 
Even though this claim may be true, we should not be deceived by these people and their claims, because the purpose of these claims is to remove gheerah (protective jealousy) from the hearts of the woman’s family, and to open the door for women to commit immoral actions. 
What the guardians of women must do is to fear Allaah regarding those who are under their care, and prevent them from committing immoral actions or doing the things that lead to that, and not be either careless or too strict.

“And those who invoke not any other ilaah (god) along with Allaah, nor kill such person as Allaah has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse and whoever does this shall receive the punishment.
The torment will be doubled to him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace”
[al-Furqaan 25:69]
Al-Qurtubi said: 
The followers of all religions are agreed that adultery is forbidden; no religion regards it as permissible. Hence the punishment for it is one of the most severe punishments, because it is a crime against honour and lineage, which is one of the five basic principles that Islam seeks to protect, namely life, religion, lineage, reason and wealth.  
Tafseer al-Qurtubi, 24/20, 21 
1 – If a woman has been previously married – i.e., a legitimate marriage with her has been consummated – then her punishment is to be stoned to death. 
‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with him) said, when he was sitting on the minbar of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Allaah sent Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with the truth, and revealed to him the Book. One of the things that He revealed was the verse of stoning, which we have read and understood. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) carried out the punishment of stoning and we did so after him. I fear that as time goes by, people will say, ‘We do not find any mention of stoning in the Book of Allaah,’ so they will go astray by forsaking an obligation that was revealed by Allaah. In the Book of Allaah, stoning is the punishment deserved by any previously-married person, man or woman, who commits adultery, if proof is established, or pregnancy results, or he or she confesses.” 
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2462; Muslim, 1691) 
2 – If the woman is a virgin – i.e., she is not married yet or the marriage contract has been done but her husband has not yet consummated the marriage with her – then the punishment is one hundred lashes and exile from her country for a year, as stated in the hadeeth of ‘Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit, who narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Receive (teaching) from me. Allah has ordained a way for those (women). When an unmarried male commits adultery with an unmarried female (they should receive) one hundred lashes and banishment for one year. And in the case of a married male committing adultery with a married female, they shall receive one hundred lashes and be stoned to death.” 
(Narrated by Muslim, 1690). 
If the adulterer or adulteress is a minor below the age of puberty, then there is no punishment to be carried out, according to all scholars. 
Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
With regard to puberty and sound mind, the scholars are agreed that both are conditions of punishment being obligatory.  
Al-Mughni, 8/134. 
The evidence for that is the words of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “The Pen has been lifted from three, from the sleeper until he awakes, from the minor until he grows up, and from the insane until he regains his reason.” (Narrated by al-Nasaa’i, 3432; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Nasaa’i, 3210). 
But the minor boy or girl should be punished, with something less than the hadd punishment, in a manner that will deter them from doing this action. And their guardian must also be punished if there was any shortcoming on his part, such as allowing his daughter to mix with boys or being careless concerning such matters. 
The girl has to conceal what she has done, and her guardian must also conceal it, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Avoid these filthy things that Allaah has forbidden. Whoever has done any of them, let him conceal himself with the concealment of Allaah, and let him repent to Allaah…” 
(Narrated by al-Haakim; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 149). 
If the signs of puberty are present in the boy or the girl, then he or she becomes accountable (mukallif) thereby. Information on these signs may be found in Questions Nos.  21246 and 13262.

1 – The Muslim should not keep away from his wife for more than six months, as stipulated by Ameer al-Mu’mineen ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with him), as was narrated by ‘Abd al-Razzaaq in his Musannaf, 7/152. 
If a Muslim is away for longer than that, then both parties may fall into temptation and be affected by whispers from the Shaytaan. 
This may lead to thinking about haraam things, and after thinking about such things he may be provoked into satisfying his desires, and this may lead him to falling into haraam – Allaah forbid. Desire has power over a person’s mind and this may lead him to look at pictures or haraam things. 
2 – The Muslim must break the power of his desire by fasting, lowering his gaze, avoiding temptation and turning away from it. He must fear Allaah as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and follow not the footsteps of Shaytaan (Satan). Verily, he is to you an open enemy”
[al-Baqarah 2:168]
3 – Another issue that has to do with this topic is that it is not permissible for a woman to describe another (non-mahram) woman to her husband, so that he will not imagine her as if he is looking at her. 
It was narrated that Ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No woman should look at or touch another woman to describe her to her husband as if he can see her.”

8991,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/8991,Is it permissible to put a marker on a grave so that it will be known whose grave it is?,"The custom in our country is to put a stone, concrete or a peg at the head and foot of the grave, or sometimes just at the head. What is the Islamic ruling on that?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Islam forbids erecting structures over graves, and commands that any such structures should be knocked down. But it is permitted to put a marker on the grave so that the family and friends of the deceased will know where it is. However, this marker should not be a structure or anything else that is not allowed in sharee’ah. 
1 – With regard to the prohibition on erecting structures over graves, the evidence for that is as follows. 
It was narrated that Jaabir said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade plastering over graves, sitting on them and erecting structures over them. 
Narrated by Muslim, 970. 
Al-Shawkaani said: 
The phrase “erecting structures over them: indicates that it is haraam to build anything over a grave. 
Al-Shaafa’i and his companions made the following distinction: if the structure is built on the property of the person who builds it, it is makrooh, and if it is in a public graveyard, it is haraam. 
But there is no evidence for making this distinction. 
Al-Shaafa’i said: I saw the imams in Makkah ordering that what had been built (over graves) was to be knocked down. 
The hadith of ‘Ali also indicates that such structures should be destroyed. 
Nayl al-Awtaar, 4/132; the view of al-Shaafa’i is mentioned in al-Umm, 1/277 
The hadith of ‘Ali referred to will be quoted below.
With regard to the command to knock down structures that have been built over graves, that is proven in the Sunnah. 
It was narrated that Abu’l-Hayaaj al-Asadi said: ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib said to me: “Shall I not send you on the same mission as the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sent me? Do not leave any statue without erasing it, and do not leave any raised grave without leveling it.”  (Narrated by Muslim, 969). 
Al-Shawkaani said: 
The words “do not leave any raised grave without leveling it” means that the Sunnah is that a grave should not be made very high, and there should be no differentiation between those who were virtuous and those who were not virtuous. 
It seems that making a grave higher than the amount that is permitted is haraam. This was clearly stated by the companions of Ahmad and a group of the companions of al-Shaafa’i and Maalik. 
The view that it is not haraam because the earlier and later generations did that without anyone denouncing that action, as Imam Yahya and al-Mahdi said in al-Ghayth, is not correct, because the most that can be said is that they kept quiet about it, and keeping quiet does not count as evidence if it has to do with matters which are not definitive, and the prohibition of making graves high is not definitive. 
The making graves high that is mentioned in the hadith especially includes the domes and shrines that are built over graves, and the taking of graves as places of worship. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed those who do that. (Nayl al-Awtaar, 4/130). 
With regard to it being permissible to mark a grave with something permissible, there is evidence in the Sunnah which explains that. 
It was narrated from Katheer ibn Zayd al-Madani that al-Muttalib said: When ‘Uthmaan ibn Maz’oon died, his bier was brought out and he was buried, then the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ordered a man to bring a rock but he was not able to carry it. So the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stood up and rolled up his sleeves. Katheer said: al-Muttalib said: the one who narrated that to me from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: it is as if I can see the whiteness of the arms of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he rolled up his sleeves. Then he carried it and placed it at the head (of the grave), and said, “From this I will recognize the grave of my brother, and I can bury those among my family who die near him.” (Narrated by Abu Dawood, 3206) 
The isnaad of this hadith was classed as hasan by al-Haafiz ibn Hajar in al-Talkhees al-Habeer, 2/133). 
Ibn Qudaamah said: 
There is nothing wrong with marking a grave with a stone of a piece of wood. There is nothing wrong with a man marking a grave so that he will know where it is. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) marked the grave of ‘Uthmaan ibn Maz’oon. Al-Mughni, 2/191.

But what is mentioned in the first part of the question, about kissing the woman during the engagement period – if this was before the marriage contract (‘aqd or nikaah), then it is haraam. The same applies to being stimulated manually by the woman. But if it was after the marriage contract then there is nothing wrong with kissing. With regard to adulterers marrying one another, there is nothing wrong with that, after waiting out an ‘iddah period and after both parties have repented. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Women impure are for men impure… and women of purity are for men of purity…” [al-Noor 24:26  - Yoosuf ‘Ali’ translation of the meaning]. Repentance is essential on the part of both, but it is not permissible to conclude the marriage contract until after the waiting-period and making sure that the woman is not pregnant as a result of zinaa. Once that has been established, there is no reason why they should not marry one another.

How true is this?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.What is well known is that Shaykh ‘Abd

The Council of Senior Scholars issued a statement on the ruling on 
    this “money-pooling”, the text of which is as follows:  
, the Lord of the Worlds, and complete and

    teachers and others, to the President of the Ministry for Academic Research and Issuing Fatwas and Da’wah and Guidance, which were passed on by 
    His Excellency to the Council for a ruling on workers “pooling” their money and the way in which this is done, which is that a number of people 
    who usually work in one place, such as a school or department, etc., all agree to pay an equal amount of money at the end of the month, then the 
    entire amount is given to one of them; the following month the amount is given to another one, and so on until each one of them has received the 
    same amount as the others, no more and no less. 
The committee also examined a study prepared 
    by Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Sulaymaan al-Munayyi’ concerning the ruling on loans which lead to benefits, then they discussed the issue, and the 
    majority of the council decided that there was no reason to disallow this kind of transaction, because the benefits gained by the lender do not 
    detract from the money of the borrower, rather the borrower benefits equally because all of the participants benefit and none of them is adversely 
    affected or gains more than another. There is nothing in the pure sharee’ah that forbids benefits in which no one is adversely affected, rather it 
    prescribes such things.

    have mercy upon him), he issued a fatwa stating that these “money pools” are permissible. He was asked about the ruling on them and said:  There 
    is nothing wrong with that. It is a loan in which there is no condition that one person benefits more than another. The Council of Senior Scholars 
    looked into that and decided by a majority vote that that is permissible because it benefits all participants and no one is adversely affected. … 
    and Allaah is the Source of strength.
