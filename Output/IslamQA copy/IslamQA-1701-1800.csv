          Calling to Allah must be accompanied by wisdom, peaceful 
          advice and flexibility. Callers to Allah are to focus on the most important 
          issues and move to what follows. The Prophet, peace be upon him, said 
          to Mu’ath ibn Jabal when he sent him to Yemen, “First, call them to 
          testify that there is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is His Messenger. 
          If they respond, ask them to perform five daily prayers. If they respond, 
          tell them that Allah has imposed Zakat (Alms taxes) which is to be taken 
          from the rich and distributed among the poor.
 
          One should also wait for the best opportunity by choosing 
          the suitable time and place for propagation.",Sheikh Ibn Othaimeen
1704,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1704,Does a Wife Have to Cook and Clean?,"Is it the wife's duty to do all the housework, must the husband help her or not? Or is it possible that her work is just a favour to the husband and the family and she will be rewarded for it, as if she gave sadaqah?",It is the wife’s duty to serve her husband within the bounds of what is reasonable and as other wives who are like her serve husbands who are like him.,"Should the wife serve her husband?


Evidence for the view that it is a woman’s duty to serve her husband","Praise be to Allah.Should the wife serve her husband?
The more correct view in this matter is that stated by a number of scholars, such as Abu Bakr ibn Abi Shaybah, Abu Ishaq al-Jawzjani and Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on them), who said that it is the woman’s duty to serve her husband within the bounds of what is reasonable and as other women who are like her serve husbands who are like him. 
She also has to take care of the house, doing things like cooking and so on, in accordance with what is customary among people like her and her husband. This differs according to circumstances, time and place, hence Ibn Taymiyah said: This varies according to circumstances. What the Bedouin wife has to do is not the same as what the urban wife has to do.
Evidence for the view that it is a woman’s duty to serve her husband
The evidence for this more correct opinion is:

the Hadith of al-Bukhari:

Imam al-Bukhari narrated in his Sahih that Fatimah (may Allah be pleased with her), the daughter of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked him for a servant. He said, Shall I not tell you of something that is better for you than that? When you go to sleep, say Subhan-Allah (Glory be to Allah) thirty three times, Al-Hamdu Lillah (praise be to Allah) thirty three times, and Allahu akbar (Allah is Most Great) thirty four times. (Sahih al-Bukhari bi Sharh al-Asqalani, part 9/506)
Al-Tabari said, in his commentary on this Hadith: “We may understand from this Hadith that every woman who is able to take care of her house by making bread, grinding flour and so on, should do so. It is not the duty of the husband if it is the custom for women like her to do this themselves.”
What we learn from the Hadith is that when Fatimah (may Allah be pleased with her) asked her father (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) for a servant, he did not command her husband to find her a servant or hire someone to do these tasks, or to do these tasks himself. If it were Ali’s duty to do these things, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would have commanded him to do them.

The Hadith of Asma bint Abi Bakr

Imam al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) reported in his Sahih that Asma bint Abi Bakr (may Allah be pleased with her) said: I got married to al-Zubayr, and he had no wealth on earth and no slaves, nothing except a camel for bringing water and his horse. I used to feed his horse and bring water, and I used to sew patches on the bucket. I made dough but I was not good at baking bread, so my (female) neighbours among the Ansar used to bake bread for me, and they were sincere women. I used to bring date pits from al-Zubayr’s land that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had given to him, carrying them on my head. This land was two-thirds of a farsakh away. One day I came, carrying the date pits on my head, and I met the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who had a group of the Ansar with him. He called me and made his camel kneel down for me to ride behind him, but I felt too shy to go with the men, and I remembered al-Zubayr and his jealousy, for he was the most jealous of people. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) realized that I felt shy, so he moved on. I came to al-Zubayr and told him, I met the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when I was carrying date pits on my head, and he had a group of his Companions with him. He made his camel kneel down for me to ride with him, but I remembered your jealousy. He said, By Allah, it bothers me more that you have to carry the date pits than that you should ride with him. Asma said: After that, Abu Bakr sent me a servant to take care of the horse, and it was as if I had been liberated from slavery. (Reported by al-Bukhari, Fath, 9/319).
In the commentary on the Hadith of Asma, it says: “From this incident we may understand that it is the woman's duty to take care of everything that her husband needs her to take care of. This was the opinion of Abu Thawr. Other fuqaha suggested that Asma did this voluntarily and that she was not obliged to do it.”
Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani said: 
“It seems that this incident Asma carrying the date pits to help her husband and other similar incidents were the matter of necessity, namely that her husband al-Zubayr and other Muslim men were preoccupied with jihad and other things that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had commanded them to do, and they did not have time to take care of domestic matters themselves, and could not afford to hire servants to do that for them, and there was no one else who could do that apart from their womenfolk. So the women used to take care of the home and whoever lived in it, so that the men could devote their time to supporting Islam.
Then he said (may Allah have mercy on him): What is more likely is that the matter had to do with the customs in that land, for customs may vary in this regard.
It seems that what Ibn Hajar said is close to the view of those who say that the wife has to take care of her husband and the home in accordance with the dictates of local custom.
Ibn al-Qayyim said, concerning the story of Asma: When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw Asma with the date pits on her head, and her husband al-Zubayr was with her, he did not tell him that she did not have to serve him, or that this was unfair to her. He approved of her serving him and of all the women among the Sahabah helping their husbands. This is a matter concerning which there is no doubt.

The Hadith of Jabir

The Shaykh of the Muhaddithin, Imam al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) reported in his Sahih that Jabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah said: My father died and left seven daughters, or nine daughters. I married a woman who had been previously married, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to me, Did you get married, O Jabir? I said, Yes. He asked, A virgin or a previously-married woman? I said, A previously-married woman. He said, Why not a young woman so you could play and joke with one another? I said, ‘Abd-Allah [the father of Jabir] has died and left behind daughters, and I would not like to bring them someone who is like them, so I got married to a woman who can take care of them. He said, May Allah bless you or Fair enough. (Sahih al-Bukhari bi Sharh al-Asqalani, vol.9/513).
The evidence derived from the Hadith of Jabir is that al-Bukhari introduced this Hadith under the heading, Bab ‘awn al-marah zawjaha fi waladih (Chapter: a woman helping her husband with his children).
Imam Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani said, commenting on this introduction by al-Bukhari: It seems that al-Bukhari derived the idea that a woman should take care of her husband’s children from the fact that the wife of Jabir took care of his sisters; if she should take care of his sisters then it is even more befitting that she should take of his children. (Sahih al-Bukhari bi Sharh al-Asqalani, vol.9/513).
We can say that the wife should take care of her husband, as this is more befitting than her taking care of his sisters or his daughters from another wife.
We may also understand from this Hadith that what was customary at the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was that women did not only take care of their husbands, they also took care of those who were dependent on their husbands and lived in their houses.
The evidence that this understanding is correct is the fact that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not tell Jabir off for his reason for marrying a previously-married woman, which was that she could take care of his sisters. This indicates that the custom among the Muslims at that time dictated that the wife should take care of those who were under her husband’s care, which means that the wife should serve her husband in those matters that are dictated by local custom, because the husband’s right to be served by his wife comes before that of his sisters.

‘Urf (custom)

General contracts including marriage contracts should be governed by the customs that are known among the people, and the custom is that the wife should serve her husband and also take care of matters in the home. In some societies, the custom is that the wife should take care of more than the regular domestic matters.
Imam al-Qurtubi said, concerning the matter of the wife serving her husband and taking care of the home: This has to do with ‘Urf, which is one of the bases of Shari`ah. The women of the Bedouin and the desert-dwellers serve their husbands, even looking for fresh water and taking care of the animals
What happens nowadays is that the wife usually serves her husband and takes care of different matters within the home. There may be a servant to help her with that if her husband can afford it. If the husband knows that the majority of scholars say that it is not obligatory for the wife to serve her husband and take care of the house, I say that one of the benefits of this may be that he will not go to extremes and demand too much of his wife in this regard, and that he will not give her a hard time if she falls short, because what she is doing is not a duty according to the majority of jurists. However, even it is a duty according to some of them and this is what we think is more correct the fact that there is such a difference of opinion means that the husband has to look at what she is doing as something voluntary rather than obligatory, or something in which the scholars differ as to whether it is obligatory, so he should be gentle with her if he sees that she is falling short in this regard, and he should encourage her and help her to do it.

1730,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1730,Fasting in countries where the day is very short or very long,"In some parts of the Scandinavian countries, the day may be much longer than the night, depending on the time of year. The night may be only three hours long, when the day is twenty-one hours. If it happens that Ramadan comes in the winter, the Muslims fast for only three hours, but if it happens that Ramadan comes in the summer, they do not fast because they are not able to, as the day is so long. Please tell us when we should have suhoor and iftaar, and on how many days of Ramadan we should fast.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Islam is perfect and comprehensive. Allah says (interpretation of the meanings):
“… This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion…” [al-Maa’idah 5:3]
“Say [O Muhammad]: ‘What thing is the most great to witness?’ Say: ‘Allah (the Most Great!) is Witness between me and you; this Quran has been revealed to me that I may therewith warn you and whomsoever it may reach…” [al-An’aam 6:19]
“And We have not sent you [O Muhammad] except as a giver of glad tidings and a warner to all mankind….” [Saba’ 34:28]
Allah has told the believers that fasting is obligatory (interpretation of the meaning):
“O you who believe! Observing al-sawm (fasting) is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, that you may become the pious.” [al-Baqarah 2:183]
And Allah has explained when the fasting should begin and end (interpretation of the meaning):
“… and eat and drink until the white thread (light of dawn appears to you distinct from the black thread (darkness of night), then complete your fast till the nightfall…” [al-Baqarah 2:187]
This ruling is not addressed to any particular country or type of people; it is a universal law, which also includes the people asked about in the question. Allah is Merciful and Kind towards His slaves and has prescribed for them ways of ease to help them to do what He has made obligatory. For example, He allows travellers and the sick not to fast during Ramadan, to save them from hardship, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):
“The month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Quran, a guidance for mankind and clear proofs for the guidance and the criterion (between right and wrong). So whoever of you sights (the crescent on the first night of) the month (of Ramadan, i.e., is present at his home), he must observe fasting that month, and whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number [of days which one did not observe sawm (fasts( must be made up] from other days…” [al-Baqarah 2:185]
So every responsible adult Muslim who is present when Ramadan comes is obliged to fast, no matter whether the day is short or long. If a person is unable to complete a day’s fast, and fears that he may die or become ill, he is permitted to eat just enough to keep his strength up and keep himself safe from harm, then he should stop eating and drinking for the rest of the day, and he has to make up the days he has missed later on, when he is able to fast.

Worship is due only to Allaah; it is not permitted to direct worship towards anyone else. Hence 
    the Muslims are agreed that whoever calls upon anyone other than Allaah is a mushrik (polytheist, one who associates others with Allaah). 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said:

    and asks them to bring that which will benefit him and ward off harmful things, such as asking them to forgive sins, guide them, relieve them of

If you invoke (or call upon) them, they 
    hear not your call; and if (in case) they were to hear, they could not grant it (your request) to you. And on the Day of Resurrection, they will 
    disown your worshipping them. And none can inform you (O Muhammad) like Him Who is the All‑Knower (of everything)”

Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Hasan Aal

    are called upon instead of Him, of the angels, Prophets, idols, etc. in a manner that indicates their helplessness and weakness, and that they 
    lack the abilities that are to be expected in the one who is called upon, such as sovereignty, the ability to hear the call and the ability to 
    respond. 
Fath al-Majeed, 
    p. 158 
How can the Messenger  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) be called upon, when Allaah has commanded him to say, “Say: ‘It is not in

Hence there can be no doubt that it is a mistake to praise the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) in the words 
“O most noble of creation, I have nobody to 
    turn to except you when calamity strikes.” 
The major scholars have denounced this as 
    being wrong. 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah 
    have mercy on him) said, in his footnotes to the book Fath al-Majeed, commenting on the poem Burdat al-Busayri from which these 
    words are taken: 
The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) warned us, according to the report 
    narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim, ‘Do not praise me as the Christians praised ‘Eesa ibn Maryam, I am the slave of Allaah and His Messenger.’ 
    Rather the way to venerate him and love him is by following his Sunnah and establishing his religion and rejecting all the myths that the ignorant 
    attribute to him. But most of the people do not do this, and they occupy themselves with this exaggeration and praise which leads them to commit 
    major shirk.” 
Fath al-Majeed, 
    p. 155 
Moreover, it is not known that even a single Sahaabi used to seek the help of the Messenger or 
    call upon the Messenger, neither was that transmitted from any of the respectable scholars. It is only one of the myths of the deviant.

Is It permissible or not.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to raise his hands for takbeerat al-ihram (the takbeer at the beginning of the prayer), sometimes whilst saying the takbeer, sometimes after it and sometimes before. (al-Bukhari and al-Nisaa’i)
When he had finished reciting Quran, he would pause for a moment then raise his hands, say takbeer and do rukoo’.
(Sifat Salat al-Nabi (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), p. 128).
He used to raise his hands when he stood up from rukoo’
(reported by al-Bukhaari and Muslim), and this raising of the hands is mutawaatir (reported by so many to so many that it is inconceivable that they could all have agreed on a lie). It is the opinion of the majority of scholars and of some of the Hanafis. (Sifat Salat al-Nabi (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) by al-Albaani, p. 136).
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say takbeer when he got up for the third rak’ah
(reported by al-Bukhaari and Muslim), and he would raise his hands sometimes when he said this takbeer. (al-Bukhaari and Abu Dawood). (Sifat Salat al-Nabi (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), p. 177).
Raising the hands in prayer was a well-known practice among the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Imaam al-Bukhaari said: “Al-Hasan and Humayd ibn Hilaal said: ‘The Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) all used to raise their hands, without exception.”
(Juz’ raf’ al-yadayn, p. 26, ma’a jila’ al-‘aynayn).
Ibn al-Qayyim said: “Look at the practice at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and the Sahaabah after him. They used to raise their hands in prayer when doing rukoo’, and when standing up again. And in the time of the Sahaabah, if ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar saw someone not raising his hands in prayer, he would throw a stone at him. [next phrase is unclear].
(I’laam al-Muwaqqi’een, 2/376).
So what is proven in the Sunnah with regard to raising the hands in prayer is that they should be raised at four points in the prayer: when pronouncing takbeerat al-ihram, when doing rukoo’, when standing up from rukoo’, and after standing up from the first tashahhud.

1774,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1774,Is the First Look at Women Allowed?,"I know it is absolutely forbidden to gaze at women. If one accidentally catches my eyes sometimes I keep looking for a second or two and then I remember Allah's command and immediately look down.
My question is: for that very little time that I do look at the lady, do I earn sins?","Deliberately looking at a non-Mahram woman and continuing to look after a first accidental glance is prohibited. It is forbidden to look at any part of her body, whether you think she is beautiful or not, whether it provokes sexual desire or not, whether it is accompanied by evil thoughts or not, and whether it leads to immoral deeds or not.",,"Praise be to Allah.Jarir ibn Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: ""I asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon Him) about an accidental glance at a woman . He commanded me to turn my gaze away."" (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, who said: This is an authentic Hadith. See As-Sunan, 2700).
Commenting on this Hadith, Al-Mubarakpuri (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
""Accidental means that his gaze fell on a non-Mahram woman unintentionally . He commanded me to turn my gaze away means that he was not to look a second time, because the first glance was not by choice and would be forgiven, but any further glances would be counted as sin, and he should heed the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things) [An-Nur 24:30]""
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon Him) said: ""O `Ali, do not follow a glance with another, for you will be forgiven for the first, but not for the second."" (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 2701; see Sahih Al-Jami`, 7953)
In At-Tuhfah, it says: ""The words ‘do not follow a glance with another’ mean do not look again after the first glance. You will be forgiven for the first means that you will be forgiven if the first glance was unintentional, and but not for the second means that because the second glance was by choice, it will be counted against you.""
So it is clear that deliberately looking at a non-Mahram woman and continuing to look after a first accidental glance is prohibited. It is forbidden to look at any part of her body, whether you think she is beautiful or not, whether it provokes sexual desire or not, whether it is accompanied by evil thoughts or not, and whether it leads to immoral deeds or not.
We ask Allah to protect you and us from all forbidden deeds. Allah is the One Who guides to the Straight Path.

1783,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1783,Calling oneself by one of Allaah’s names in ignorance,"After embracing Islam, I ignorantly changed my name to one of Allah's 99 
names. It's been a year and all my records reflect this name not to mention 
that everyone is accustomed to it. Am I burdened to officially put an 
Abdul infront of my name or can I just start verbally using it? Also, I was 
told that it was haram to change my name.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
Some of Allaahs names are also suitable for human beings and it is permissible to use 
them, so long as one distinguishes between the meaning applied to the Creator and the 
meaning applied to the created being, such as Kareem (generous), Lateef (kind), 
Shaheed (witness), Hakeem (wise), etc. Other Divine names may not be given to human 
beings because they are befitting only for Allaah, such as al-Baari (the Creator), 
al-Raaziq (the Provider), al-Muhyi (the Giver of Life), al-Awwal (the First), al-Aakhir 
(the Last), etc.
If your name is of the first type, then there is nothing wrong with it. If it is of the 
second type, then putting the word ""Abd"" (slave of) in front of the name will solve the 
problem. May Allaah help us to adhere to the truth.
