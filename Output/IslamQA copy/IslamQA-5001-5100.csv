    so-called “Islamic” songs with musical instruments","i would like to know if muslims are allowed
      to lisen to islamic songs with instruments in it. please answer by using the quran and the
      sunnah or ijmaa.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The aayaat of the Quraan and the Ahaadeeth of the
    Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) indicate that musical instruments are
    condemned, and warn us against them. The Quraan teaches that playing these
    instruments is one of the things that leads people astray and constitutes mockery of the
    Signs of Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
And of mankind is he who purchases idle talk to mislead (men)
    from the Path of Allaah, without knowledge, and takes it (the Path of Allaah, the Verses
    of the Quraan) by way of mockery. For such there will be a humiliating torment (in
    the Hell-fire). [Luqmaan 31:6]
Most of the scholars interpreted lahw al-hadeeth (idle
    talk) as meaning singing and musical instruments, and every voice that diverts
    people from the truth.
Al-Tabari (Jaami al-Bayaan, 15/118-119), Ibn
    Abil-Dunya (Dham al-Malaahi, 33) and Ibn al-Jawzi (Talbees Iblees,
    232) all reported that concerning the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):
[Allaah said to Shaytaan;] And istafziz [literally means
    befool them gradually] those whom you can with your voice, make assaults on them with your
    cavalry and your infantry, mutually share with them wealth and children, and make promises
    to them. But Shaytaan promises them nothing but deceit [al-Isra 17:64]
Mujaahid said, This refers to singing and flutes.

Al-Tabari reported that al-Hasan al-Basri said:
His voice is the tambourine.
Ibn al-Qayyim said in Ighaathat al-Lahfaan (1/252):
The grammatical structure here (idaafah  genitive or
    possessive) is used to make something specific (idaafat al-takhsees), and in all these
    words in the aayah it refers back to the Shaytaan [addressed here as you by
    Allaah, may He be glorified]. Everyone who speaks about anything other than obedience of
    Allaah or plays a reed pipe, flute, tambourine or drum, all of this is the voice of
    Shaytaan.
Al-Tirmidhi reported in his Sunan (no. 1005) from Ibn Abi Layla
    from Ata from Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: The
    Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) went to to al-Nakhl with
    Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Awf, when his son Ibraaheem was dying. He took the child in
    his lap and his eyes filled with tears. Abd al-Rahmaan said, Are you weeping
    when you have forbidden us to weep? He said, 'I do not forbid weeping. What I have
    forbidden is two foolish and evil kinds of voices: voices at times of entertainment and
    play and the flutes of the Shaytaan, and voices at times of calamity and scratching the
    face and rending the garments and screaming.
Al-Tirmidhi said: this is a hasan hadeeth. It was also reported by
    al-Haakim in al-Mustadrak, no. 1683, al-Bayhaqi in al-Sunan al-Kubra (4/69),
    al-Tayaalisi in Musnad (no. 1683) and by al-Tahhaawi in Sharh al-Maaani,
    4/29, and it was classed as hasan by al-Albaani.
Al-Nawawi said: What is meant here is singing and musical
    instruments. See Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi, 4/88.
It was reported in a saheeh hadeeth from the Prophet 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: In my ummah there will be people who allow
    fornication/adultery (zina), silk, wine and musical instruments [maaazif].
    Some people will stay at the side of a mountain, and they will have flocks of sheep. When
    a poor person comes in the evening to ask them for something he needs, they will say.
    Come back to us tomorrow. Then during the night Allaah will destroy them by
    causing the mountain to fall upon them, while He changes others into apes and swine. They
    will remain in such a state until the Day of Resurrection.
(Reported by al-Bukhaari in al-Saheeh muallaqan, 51/10.
    Reported mawsoolan by al-Bayhaqi in al-Sunan al-Kubra, 3/272; al-Tabaraani in al-Mujam
    al-Kabeer, 3/319; and Ibn Hibbaan in al-Saheeh (8/265-266). Classed as saheeh
    by Ibn al-Salaah in Uloom al-Hadeeth (32), Ibn al-Qayyim in Ighaathat
    al-Lahfaan (255) and Tahdheeb al-Sunan (5/270-272), al-Haafiz in al-Fath
    (10/51) and al-Albaani in al-Saheehah (1/140)).
Al-Haafiz said in al-Fath (10/55): Maaazif refers
    to musical instruments. Al-Qurtubi reported from al-Jawhari that maaazif
    meant singing, and what it says in his book al-Sihaah is that it refers to musical
    instruments. It was also said that it is the sound of musical instruments. In a footnote
    by al-Dimyaati it says: maaazif is tambourines and other kinds of drums. The
    word azif is applied to singing and all other kinds of instruments that may
    be played.
Ibn al-Qayyim said in Ighaathat al-Lahfaan (1/256):
The evidence for this is that maaazif refers to all kinds
    of things used for entertainment. There is no dispute among scholars of the Arabic
    language on this point. If they were halaal, he would not have condemned those who
    permitted them, or compared permitting them to permitting wine and zina.
We may understand from the hadeeth that all kinds of musical
    instruments are forbidden. This is clear from the hadeeth for a number of reasons:
The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said
         there will be people who allow It is clear that the things listed
        here, including musical instruments, are forbidden in shareeah, but those people
        will allow them.

He compared musical instruments to things that are definitely known to
        be haraam, namely zina and alcohol. If instruments were not haraam, he would not have made
        this comparison. The evidence of this hadeeth that singing is haraam is definitive. Even
        if no other hadeeth or aayah spoke about musical instruments, this hadeeth would be
        sufficient to prove that they are haraam, especially the kind of singing that is known
        among people nowadays, the essence of which is obscenity and foul talk, based on all kinds
        of musical instruments such as guitars, drums, flutes, ouds, zithers, organs, pianos,
        violins and other things that make it more enticing, such as the voices of these
        effeminate singers and whores.(See Hukm al-Maaazif by al-Albaani, Tas-heeh
    al-Ahkta wal-Awhaam al-Waaqiah fi Ahaadeeth al-Nabi
    alayhil-salaam by Raaid Sabri, 1/176).
Shaykh Ibn Baaz said in Majmoo al-Fataawa,
    3/423-424):
Maaazif refers to singing and musical instruments.
    The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us that at the end of time
    there will come a people who will allow these things just as they will allow alcohol, zina
    and silk. This is one of the signs of his Prophethood, for all of this has happened. The
    hadeeth indicates that [musical instruments] are haraam, and condemns those who say they
    are halaal, just as it condemns those who say that alcohol and zina are allowed. The
    aayaat and ahaadeeth that warn against singing and musical instruments are many indeed.
    Whoever claims that Allaah has allowed singing and musical instruments is lying and is
    committing a great evil. We ask Allaah to keep us from obeying our desires and the
    Shaytaan. Even worse and more seriously sinful than that are those who say it is
    mustahabb. Undoubtedly this stems from ignorance about Allaah and His Religion; it is
    insolent blasphemy against Allaah and lying about His Laws. What is mustahabb is to beat
    on the daff [simple hand drum] at weddings. This is mustahabb for women only, in order to
    announce the wedding and to distinguish it from fornication. There is nothing wrong with
    women singing amongst themselves, accompanied by the daff, so long as the songs contain no
    words that encourage evil or distract people from their duties. It is also a condition
    that this should take place among women only, and there should be no mixing with men. It
    should also not cause any annoyance or disturbance to neighbours. What some people do, of
    amplifying such singing with loudspeakers is evil, because of the disturbance it causes to
    other Muslims, neighbours and others. It is not permissible for women, in weddings or on
    other occasions, to use any instrument other than the daff, such as the oud, violin, rebab
    (stringed instrument) and so on. This is evil, and the only concession that women are
    given is that they may use the daff.
As for men, it is not permissible for them to play any kind of musical
    instrument, whether at weddings or on any other occasion. What Allaah has prescribed for
    men is training in the use of instruments of war, such as target practice or learning to
    ride horses and competing in that, using spears, shields, tanks, airplanes and other
    things such as cannons, machine guns, bombs and anything else that may help jihaad for the
    sake of Allaah.
Shaykh al-Islam said in al-Fataawa (11/569):
I know that in the golden age, the first and best
    three centuries, in the Hijaaz, in Syria, in the Yemen, in Egypt, in the Maghreb, in Iraq,
    in Khorasan, none of the religious and righteous people, the ascetics and those who
    worshipped Allaah much, would gather to listen to this whistling and clapping and
    drum-beating and so on. This was innovated after that at the end of the second century,
    and whenever the imaams saw it, they denounced it.
As for these anaasheed which are described as Islamic but
    are accompanied with musical instruments, giving them this name lends them some measure of
    legitimacy, but in fact they are singing and music, so calling them Islamic nasheeds is
    falsehood and deception. They cannot be a substitute for singing, as an evil thing cannot
    be substituted for another evil thing. We should replace something evil with something
    good. Listening to it on the grounds that it is Islamic and an act of worship is
    bidah, and Allaah does not allow this. We ask Allaah to keep us safe and sound.

I was just wondering, if you don't mind doing it, if you could send me some more information, maybe one particular woman's stories? I don't really know much about Islamic women, and I, like other non - Islamic women/girls, have the perception that an Islamic woman's life is a bit restricted. I hope that you can put me right on that matter.",,,"Praise be to Allah.We thank you for your interest and your question. We will tell you the story of a great Muslim woman; we hope that you will find what you are looking for, and that this will be a light to guide you to the path of Truth.
Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported:
Maalik ibn Anas said to his wife Um Sulaym who was the mother of Anas This man meaning the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is forbidding alcohol. So he left Madeenah and went to Shaam (Syria), where he died. (i.e., he fled from Madeenah when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came there, because he did not like the ban on alcohol, and he died as a kaafir or non-believer in Syria). Then Abu Talhah came and proposed marriage to Um Sulaym, and spoke to her about it. She said, O Abu Talhah, a man like you would not be turned down, but you are a non-believer, and I am a Muslim woman. It is not right for me to marry you. He said, This is the chance of a lifetime! She said, What chance? He said, The yellow and white (i.e., he was tempting her with a mahr or dowry of gold and silver). She said, I do not want any yellow or white. I want you to become Muslim. If you become Muslim, that will be my mahr, and I will not ask you for anything else. He asked, Who could help me with that (i.e., to become Muslim)? She said, The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) will help you. So Abu Talhah went to look for the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who was sitting with his Companions. When he [the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)] saw him, he said, Abu Talhah is coming to you with the light of Islam shining on his forehead. (This was one of the miracles of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): he knew that Abu Talhah would become a Muslim even before he spoke). Abu Talhah told the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about what Um Sulaym had said, and he married her on that basis. Thaabit (i.e., Thaabit al-Banaani, one of the people who narrated the story from Anas) said: We have never heard of any mahr greater than this, she accepted his Islam as her dowry.
So he married her, and she was a woman with nice eyes, rather small. She was with him until she bore him a son, who Abu Talhah loved very much. The child became very ill, and Abu Talhah was very upset and distressed by the childs sickness. Abu Talhah used to get up to pray the morning prayer, he would go to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and pray with him, and would stay with him for almost half the day. Then [Abu Talhah] would come to take a nap and eat, and when he had prayed Zuhr [mid-day prayer] he would get ready and leave, and would not come back until the time of the Isha [night-time] prayer. One evening, Abu Talhah went out to see the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) (according to another report: to go to the mosque), and the child died (during his absence). Um Sulaym said, No one is to tell Abu Talhah about his childs death until I have told him. She covered the child up as if he were sleeping, and left him in a corner of the house. Abu Talhah came back from visiting the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and brought some people from the mosque with him. He asked, How is my son? She said, O Abu Talhah, from the time he fell sick, he has never been as calm as he is now, and I hope that he is resting. (She spoke vaguely so as not to upset him; this was not a lie. She was referring to the calmness of death and the child finding relief from the pain of his sickness, but her husband took it to mean that the childs condition had improved). She brought the meal and they all ate dinner, then the people left. Then he went to bed and lay down, and she got up and put on perfume and adorned herself, making herself more beautiful than she ever had before. (This was a sign of her patience and great faith in the will and decree of Allaah. She was seeking reward from Allaah and concealing her feelings, hoping that she would become pregnant that night to make up for the loss of her child). Then she came and lay down in the bed with him, and when he smelt the perfume, he did as men usually do with their wives (this is the narrators polite and circumspect manner of referring to what happened between them). At the end of the night, she said, O Abu Talhah, do you think that if some people lent something to some others, then they asked for it back, do they have the right not to give it back? He said, No. She said, Allaah, may He be glorified, lent your son to you, and now He has taken him back, so seek reward with Him and have patience. He became angry and said, You left me until I did what I did (i.e., had intercourse), then you tell me that my son has died! Then he said, Innaa Lillaahi wa innaa ilayhi raajioon (Truly, to Allaah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return the words uttered by Muslims when faced with news of death or calamity) and he praised Allaah. In the morning, he did ghusl (full ablution) then he went to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and prayed with him, and told him what had happened. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, May Allaah bless you for last night. She conceived a child (thus the Prophets prayer for them was answered).
Um Sulaym used to travel with the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), leaving Madeenah when he left, and returning when he returned. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, When she gives birth, bring the child to me. He was on a journey, and Um Sulaym was with him. When the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came back from travelling, he would never enter Madeenah at night (so as not to disturb the people, and so that wives would have time to get ready to greet their husbands). They reached the outskirts of Madeenah, and her labour pains started. Abu Talhah stayed with her, and the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) went on. Abu Talhah said, O Allaah, you know that I like to set out with your Messenger when he sets out, and come back with him when he comes back. I have been detained as You see. Um Sulaym said, O Abu Talhah, I do not feel the pains as much (this was one of her miracles; her labour pains ceased because she had asked Allaah to enable her to catch up with the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)). So they set off, and after they had reached Madeenah, her labour pains started again, and she gave birth to a boy. She told her son Anas, O Anas, I will not give him anything to eat until you take him in the morning to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and she sent some dates with him. (Because she wanted the first thing to enter the childs mouth to be food from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him); this was a sign of her great faith, because the womans natural instinct is to hasten to feed the baby as soon as he is born). The child cried all night long, and I [Anas, the narrator of this story] stayed up all night taking care of him. In the morning, I took him to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who was wearing his burdah (a kind of cloak) and marking the camels and sheep that had been given to him (the animals had been given in charity and he was marking them so that they would not get lost or mixed with other flocks or herds). When he saw him, he said to Anas, Has the daughter of Milhaan [i.e., Um Sulaym] given birth? He said, Yes. He said, I will be with you in a minute. He put down the tool in his hand (with which he had been marking the animals) and took the child, then he said, Do you have something for him? They said, Yes, dates. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) took some of the dates and chewed them, mixing them with his saliva (and the saliva of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was blessed by Allaah). Then he opened the childs mouth and gave him some of the dates, wiping them inside his mouth (this is called Tahneek and is one of the customs among Muslims when a baby is born). The infant began to smack his lips, sucking some of the sweetness of the dates and the saliva of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Thus the first thing that entered that childs stomach was mixed with the saliva of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). He said, See how much the Ansaar (the Muslims who were living in Madeenah when the Prophet migrated there) love dates! I [Anas] said, O Messenger of Allaah, name him. He wiped his face and named him Abd-Allaah. There was no young man among the Ansaar who was better than him, and when he grew up he had a lot of sons, and was martyred in Persia (he died as a martyr when the Muslims conquered Persia; all of this happened as a result of the Prophets blessed duaa).
(The story was reported by Imaam al-Bukhaari, Muslim, Ahmad and al-Tayaalisi; this version was reported by al-Tayaalisi and others. Al-Allaamah al-Albaani collected all its isnaads in his book Ahkaam al-Janaaiz, p. 20).
This is one story of one Muslim woman among the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). There are many other stories which show the effect Islam had on the hearts of Muslim women and how the religion of Allaah bore fruits of righteous deeds and good lives. In this there is enough to convince the seeker of truth of the right religion which he must follow. Read it again and think about it; maybe you will take the greatest step of your life.

Please give him our best wishes and greetings of peace (salaam) and tell him that even though we are thousands of miles away, we are praying he will stand firm in his faith and gain a proper understanding of his religion. Tell him that he has brothers in faith who share his joy at having entered Islam, even though he does not know their names or where they live. This is the relationship of believers with one another, like a structure parts of which support other parts.
With regard to yourself, you say that you know what the right decision is, and that is great. You have come a long way, and all that remains is for you to make the decision which you know you have to make.
What is life without religion? What is the point of living and working and striving if it is not for the purpose of pleasing Allah? Can there be any joy in life or salvation after death or any hope of attaining the bliss of Paradise without entering Islam? If we do not worship Allah, what are we going to worship? Our whims and desires? Would a wise person accept to be the slave of his sexual desire that will soon come to an end or of some wealth that he will soon leave behind in this transient world? Man has a spirit that will never be at peace unless he worships Allah. He has a conscience that cannot thrive except in the light of Allah. He has a soul that can never be at ease unless it is in contact with Allah, remembering Him, speaking to Him, praying and fasting for His sake, putting its trust in Him and repenting to Him. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
Is he who was dead (without Faith by ignorance and disbelief) and We gave him life (by knowledge and Faith) and set for him a light (of Belief) whereby he can walk amongst, like him who is in the darkness (of disbelief, polytheism and hypocrisy) from which he can never come out? [al-Anaam 6:122]
And whomsoever Allah wills to guide, He opens his breast to Islam, and whomsoever He wills to send astray, He makes his breast closed and constricted, as if he is climbing up to the sky [al-Anaam 6:125]
There is no need for hesitation in this matter, because it is the matter of freedom from the Fire of Hell and salvation from the wrath of al-Jabbaar (the Compeller, i.e., Allah), and attaining the victory of happiness in this world and the next. Allah Who created you and created the heavens and earth is greater, and obeying Him is more important, than the closest of relatives and the dearest of friends. Become Muslim and you will be safe. Allah will help you with regard to your parents and will give you the strength to stand firm against their pressure. Who knows, maybe you and your brother will be the cause of saving your entire family. Allah told the Prophet Moosa (Moses) about his brother Haaroon (Aaron), peace be upon them both (interpretation of the meaning): We will strengthen your arm through your brother [al-Qasas 28:35] So together they went to call Pharaoh and his people to worship Allah.
With regard to your girlfriend, do not think that this forbidden relationship will help you adhere to the truth. You have to call her to Islam and to repent to Allah. If she repents, then marry her in accordance with the Islamic way that is acceptable to Allah. If she does not, then do not feel any regrets about her. The Prophet of Islam said: Whoever gives up something for the sake of Allah, Allah will compensate him with something better.

5032,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/5032,"Is it necessary to
    do wudoo’ before doing ghusl for making oneself pure (tahaarah)","I would like to know if it's okay if i
      didn't make wudu after taking a bath???",,,"Praise be to Allah.If you are referring to the ritual bath of ghusl, then
    the answer is as follows:
Al-Bukhaari reported in al-Saheeh (248) from Aaishah
    that when the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did ghusl to purify
    himself from janaabah (impurity following intercourse), he would start by washing his
    hands, then he would do wudoo as for prayer, then he would dip his fingers into the
    water and make the water reach the roots of his hair, then he would pour water over his
    head three times, scooping the water up with both hands, and then he would pour water over
    his entire body. 
Al-Haafiz said in al-Fath (1/248):  he would start
    by washing the parts of the body ordinarily washed in wudoo in order to honour them,
    and so as to include both kinds of purification, the minor and the major
Al-Haafiz also said (1/362): Al-Bukhaari also understood this to
    mean that it is waajib when making ghusl to purify oneself from janaabah to wash oneself
    once, and that the one who does wudoo with the intention of making ghusl and then
    washes the rest of his body does not have to repeat his wudoo if he does not do
    anything to break it [e.g., pass wind, etc.] 
Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni (1/217): There are two ways of
    making ghusl to purify oneself from janaabah, one of which is sufficient, and the other is
    the perfect way. What al-Khiraqi mentions here is the perfect way. Some of our companions
    said: the perfect way includes ten things: the niyyah (intention), saying
    Bismillah (In the name of Allaah), washing the hands three times,
    washing away whatever dirt is there, doing wudoo, pouring water over the head three
    times making sure that it reaches the roots, pouring water over the rest of the body,
    starting on the right side, rubbing ones body with one's hand and moving from the
    place where one has done ghusl in order to one's feet. It is mustahabb to make sure that
    the water reaches the roots of the hair on one's head and beard before pouring water over
    them. Ahmad said: Ghusl to purify oneself from janaabah should be done in the manner
    described in the hadeeth narrated from Aaishah, who said: When the
    Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did ghusl to purify
    himself from janaabah (impurity following intercourse), he would start by washing his
    hands three times, then he would do wudoo as for prayer, then he would run his
    fingers through his hair until he thought the water had reached his scalp, then he would
    pour water over his head three times, scooping the water up with both hands, and then he
    would wash the rest of his body. (Agreed upon). Maymoonah said: The Messenger
    of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did wudoo to purify himself
    from janaabah, then he poured water on his hands and washed them two or three times, then
    he poured some water from his right hand into his left, and washed his private parts, then
    he struck his hand on the floor or wall two or three times, then he rinsed his mouth and
    his nose, and washed his face and forearms, then he poured water on his head, then he
    washed his entire body, then he moved slightly and washed his feet. Then I brought him a
    cloth, but he did not want it, and he started to wipe the water away with his hands.
    (Agreed upon). A lot of the requirements (of ghusl) are listed in these two hadeeth.
    Beginning on the right is important because the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be
    upon him) liked to always start on the right when purifying himself. According to a
    hadeeth narrated from Aaishah, when the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) did ghusl to purify himself from janaabah, he would call
    for something like a milking-vessel, and he would take some water in his hands, then he
    would start with the right side of his head, then the left. Then he would take some water
    in his hands and start pouring it over his head. (Agreed upon). With regard to
    washing the feet after doing ghusl, there was some dispute as to what Ahmad actually said.
    According to one report, he said, I would rather wash them (the feet) after doing
    wudoo, because of the hadeeth of Maymoonah. According to another report, he
    said, We should act according to the hadeeth of Aaishah, which says that
    he did wudoo for prayer before doing ghusl. And Allaah knows best.
He said: If he does ghusl once and makes water reach every part
    of his head and body, and does not do wudoo, that should be sufficient if he rinses
    his mouth and nose and has the intention to do ghusl and wudoo, but in this case is
    not doing that which is better.
What is mentioned here is what is sufficient, but the perfect way is
    preferable, which is why he said he is not doing that which is better i.e., if
    he does no more than that, this is sufficient even though he is not doing what is perfect
    and preferable. The phrase has the intention to do ghusl and wudoo means
    that ghusl is sufficient for both if he has the intention for both. This is what was
    stated by Ahmad. Another opinion was also narrated from him, which is that ghusl is not
    sufficient for wudoo unless he does wudoo either before or after ghusl. This
    is also one of the two opinions of al-Shaafai, because the Prophet 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) did that, and because both janaabah (major impurity) and
    hadath (minor impurity) are present, and purification from both is required.
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
 approach not al-salaah (the prayer) when you are in a
    drunken state until you know (the meaning) of what you utter, nor when you are in a state
    of janaabah (i.e., in a state of sexual impurity and have not yet taken a bath) except
    when travelling on the road, till you wash your whole body [al-Nisa
    4:43]
So the lack of ghusl has been made the factor that prevents a
    person from praying, and if a person has done ghusl, he has no reason not to pray. Both
    are acts of worship of the same type. In ghusl a lesser type is incorporated in a major
    type, as umrah is incorporated in Hajj.
Ibn Abd al-Birr said: The one who does ghusl to purify himself
    from janaabah, if he does not do wudoo but he makes water reach every part of his
    body, he has done what is required of him, because Allaah has enjoined upon the one who is
    in a state of janaabah to do ghusl, not wudoo, when He says (interpretation of the
    meaning):  if you are in a state of janaabah (i.e., had a sexual
    discharge), purify yourself (bathe your whole body. [al-Maaidah 5:6]. This
    is the consensus of the scholars and there is no dispute among them; they are agreed that
    it is mustahabb to do wudoo before doing ghusl, in emulation of the Messenger of
    Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and because this reinforces and
    perfects ghusl.

Can you read Tafsir books on your period?","Praise be to Allah.Can you make Du`a on your period?
Shaykh Ibn Baz (my Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Is it permissible for a menstruating woman to recite the Du`as of the Day of `Arafah despite the fact that they include verses from the Quran?
Answer:
“There is nothing wrong with a woman who is menstruating or bleeding after childbirth reciting Du`as that are prescribed for the rituals of Hajj . Also, according to the correct opinion, there is nothing wrong with them reading the Quran as well, because there is no clear authentic report that states that the woman who is menstruating or bleeding after childbirth should not read the Quran. 
It was reported that the man who is in a state of impurity following sexual activity, in particular, should not read the Quran whilst he is Junub, because of the Hadith of `Ali (may Allah be pleased with him). 
With regard to the woman who is menstruating or bleeding after childbirth there is the Hadith of Ibn `Umar: “The menstruating woman and the man who is Junub should not read Quran” – but it is inauthentic, because the Hadith was reported by Isma`il ibn `Ayyash from the Hijaziyin, and he is weak in his reports from them. But she should read without touching the Mus-haf (copy of the Qur’an in Arabic), from memory. 
In the case of the man who is Junub, he should not recite the Quran at all, either from memory or from the Mus-haf, until he has done Ghusl. The difference between them is that the timespan for the one who is Junub is very short, he can do Ghusl straightaway, as soon as he finishes having intercourse with his wife. He is not junub for long, and it is up to him when he wants to do Ghusl; if he cannot find water, he can do Tayammum (“dry ablution” using dust etc.) and pray and read the Quran. 
But the woman who is menstruating or bleeding after childbirth has no control over her situation – it rests with Allah, may He be glorified. The period lasts for a number of days and Nifas (post-natal bleeding) is the same. 
So it is permissible for them to recite Quran so that they do not forget it and so that they do not miss out on the blessings of reciting Quran and learning the rules of Shari`ah from the Book of Allah. If that is the case, then it should certainly be permissible for them to read books containing Du`as that are a mixture of verses and Hadiths, etc… this is the more correct of the two opinions of the scholars, may Allah have mercy on them.” (Fatawa Islamiyyah, 1/239)
Can you read Tafsir books on your period?
The following question was also mentioned:
I read some Tafsirs (Quranic commentaries) when I am not tahir (ritually pure), such as during my monthly period. Is there any sin on me for doing that? Will I be committing a sin if I do that?
Answer:
“There is no sin on the woman who is menstruating or bleeding after childbirth if she reads books of Tafsir or even if she reads Quran without touching the Mus-haf, according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions. 
As for the man who is Junub, he should not read Quran at all until he has done Ghusl, but he can read books of Tafsir and Hadith etc., without reading whatever they contain of verses, because of the report that nothing would stop the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) from reading Quran except janabah (major impurity). According to a Hadith narrated by Imam Ahmad with a good chain of transmission, he said: “As for the man who is Junub, he should not read even one verse.”

Is one allowed to keep it?,"When the property is found, the finder should not take it unless he is certain that he can be trusted to keep it and is able to make the necessary announcements until he finds the owner.","What is al-luqatah?


Types of lost property


Types of lost money, luggage, and animals


What to do if you find money on the ground","Praise be to Allah.What is al-luqatah?
This question has to do with al-luqatah, which is one of the categories of Islamic jurisprudence or fiqh. 
Al-luqatah is property that has gone missing from its owner. This pure religion teaches that property is to be protected and preserved, and that the property of the Muslim is sacred and is to be protected. This includes al-luqatah or lost property.
Types of lost property
If property goes missing from its owner, it has to be one of the following three scenarios:

The first scenario: it is something to which most people would not attach much value , such as a whip, or a loaf of bread, or some fruit, or a stick. In these cases, the person who finds the property may keep it and use it without having to announce it, because of the report narrated by Jabir, who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) made exceptions in the case of a stick or a whip or a rope that a man picks up.” (Reported by Abu Dawud)
The second scenario: (animals) that are unlikely to be harmed by small predators, either because of their size, such as camels, horses, cattle and mules, or because they can fly, like birds, or because they move swiftly, like gazelles, or because they can defend themselves with their fangs, like leopards. This is the category which it is haram to keep. These things do not become the property of the finder after he announces it for a year , because when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was asked about a lost camel, he said: “What has it got to do with you? It has its water, it can walk to find water and it can eat trees until its owner finds it.” (Agreed upon).

‘Umar said, “Whoever takes a lost animal is misguided ” i.e., he is a sinner. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ruled in this hadith that the lost animal should not be taken, it should be left to find its own water and to eat from the trees until its owner comes across it.
This also applies to large implements, such as big pans, wood, iron and anything that can be left alone without getting damaged. Such things can hardly be lost and cannot move from where they are, so it is haram to take them just as it is haram to take lost large animals, and in fact it may be more haram to do so.

The third scenario: any other kind of lost property, such as money , luggage, and any animals that need to be protected from small predators, such as sheep, young camels and calves. If the one who finds them can trust himself not to harm or damage these things, then it is permissible for him to pick them up. 

Types of lost money, luggage, and animals
These things are of three types:

The first type: animals that are eaten, such as young camels, sheep, chickens, the one who finds these must do what is in the best interests of the owner, which may be one of three things:


He can eat it, in which case he owes the price of the animal straight away.
He may sell it and keep the price of it to give to the owner once he has claimed it by describing the animal.

He may keep it and spend on it from his own wealth, but he does not own it, and he can claim back what he has spent on it if the owner comes and claims the animal back, because when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was asked about the sheep, he said: “Take it, because either it is for you, or your brother, or the wolf.” (Agreed upon)
The meaning is that the sheep is weak and is vulnerable to attack, so either you take it, or your brother takes it, or the wolf will eat it.
Ibn al-Qayyim said in his discussion of the hadith: 
“This includes permission to take lost sheep, and if the owner of the sheep does not come to claim it, then it belongs to the one who found it. Then he has the choice to eat it immediately, and then he will owe the price of it, or he can sell it and keep the price, or he can keep it and spend on it from his own money. The scholars agreed that if the owner comes before the finder eats it, he has the right to take it.”

The second type: things that could become spoiled, such as watermelons and fruits. The finder in this case should do what is in the owner’s best interests, whether this is eating it and paying for its value, or selling it and keeping its price until the owner comes.
The third type: all other kinds of wealth that are not covered by the first two types, such as money and vessels. All of these must be kept as a trust and announcements should be made in the places where people gather.
It is not permissible for anyone to pick up any kind of lost property unless he can be sure that he will deal with it properly and that he is able to make the necessary announcements, because of the hadith of Zayd ibn Khalid al-Juhani (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was asked about lost gold and silver. He said, ‘Know the details of the purse and the string, then announce it for a year. If no one claims it, then dispose of it, and it is like a trust in your hands. Then if the owner comes along some day, give it to him.” He was asked about the sheep, and he said, “Take it, because either it is for you, or your brother, or the wolf.” He was asked about lost camels, and he said, “What has it got to do with you? It has its water, it can walk to find water and it can eat trees until its owner finds it.” (Agreed upon)
The meaning of the phrase “Know the purse and the string” refers to the kind of purse or wallet that money is kept in and the way it is fastened or tied up.
The meaning of the phrase “then announce it for a year” is that it should be mentioned to people in the places where they gather, such as in market places and by the doors of the mosque etc. “A year” means one full year. In the first week after it is found, it should be announced every day, because it is more likely that the owner will come in that first week. After that it should be announced as often as is customary among the people.

This was the method of announcing lost property in the past. Nowadays people should make lost and found announcements in whatever way is appropriate. What matters is achieving the desired result, so one must do whatever it takes to return property to its rightful owner.

The hadith indicates that it is obligatory to know exactly what the lost property is. The phrase “Know the purse and the strings” indicates that it is obligatory to know what it looks like, so that if the owner comes and describes it properly, it can be given to him, but if his description is at odds with the true description, then it is not permissible to give it to him.
The phrase “If no one claims it, then dispose of it” indicates that the finder takes possession of the property after one year has passed and after announcing it, but he should not dispose of it before he knows exactly what it is, i.e., until he knows “the purse and the string”, and he knows its value, nature and description. If the original owner comes along some time later, and describes it accurately, he should then give it to him, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If someone comes looking for it some day, then give it to him.”

What to do if you find money on the ground
The above discussion makes it clear that there are certain obligations with regard to lost property:

When the property is found, the finder should not take it unless he is certain that he can be trusted to keep it and is able to make the necessary announcements until he finds the owner. Whoever does not feel that he can trust himself to do this is not allowed to pick it up. If he does pick it up, then he is like one who takes something wrongfully, because he took the property of someone else in a manner that is not permissible, and because by taking it he is causing the property of another person to be lost.
Before he takes it, he must be sure of its exact details, by knowing its “purse and string”, and its value, type and appearance. What is meant by its “purse” is knowing the appearance of the container it is in, whether it is a bag or a cloth, and what is meant by its “string” is what it is tied up with, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded this, and a command implies that something is obligatory.
It must be announced for a whole year, every day in the first week and then as frequently as is customary. In such announcements one can say for example, “Who has lost something?” and so on. The announcements should be made in places where people gather, such as in marketplaces or at the doors of mosques at prayer time. Announcements should not be made in the mosques themselves, because the mosques are not built for that, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever hears a man making an announcement about lost property in the mosque, let him say, ‘May Allah never return it to you!’”
If someone comes looking for it and describes it properly, it must be given to him without asking him for proof or to swear an oath, because of the command of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to that effect, and because his precise description is sufficient in the place of proof or an oath. Indeed, his description may be more clear and more honest than proof or an oath. He should also be given any increase, whether attached or separate. But if he is not able to describe it, then it should not be given to him, because it is a trust in the hands of the finder, and it is not permissible for him to give it to someone who cannot prove that he is the owner.
If the owner does not come forward after it has been announced for an entire year, it becomes the property of the finder, but before he disposes of it he must be sure of its exact description, so that if the original owner comes along some day and describes it, he can give it back to him if it is still there, or he can give him something else if it is no longer there, because his possession of it is limited and expires when the original owner comes along.

It is part of the Islamic teachings on lost property that we should understand how Islam pays attention to the issue of ownership and the sanctity of the Muslim’s property. From all of this we learn that Islam urges us to cooperate in goodness. We ask Allah to help us all to stand firm in Islam and to die as Muslims.

Rights of children over mother 


Permissible things that it is permissible for you to do without your mother interfering in your affairs


When does the father have the final say?","Praise be to Allah.Rights of mother in Islam
The mother has many major rights over her child . These rights are innumerable, but we may mention the following:

Love and respect, as much as possible, because she is the most deserving of people of her son’s good companionship.

Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “A man came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, who among the people is most deserving of my good companionship?’ He said, ‘Your mother.’ The man asked, ‘Then who?’ He said, ‘Your mother.’ He asked, Then who?’ He said, ‘Your mother.’ He asked, ‘Then who?’ He said, ‘Your father.’”
She is the one who made her womb a vessel for you and nourished you from her breast. You have no option but to love her. The fitrah (natural inclination of man) calls you to love her. Love between mothers and children and children and mothers is something that Allah has instilled even in animals, so it is even more befitting for the children of human beings, and for Muslims in particular.

Taking care of her and looking after her affairs if she needs that; this is a debt that rests on the child’s shoulders. Did she not take care of him when he was a child and stay up with him at night and bear it all with patience?

Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And We have enjoined on man to be dutiful and kind to his parents. His mother bears him with hardship. And she brings him forth with hardship…” [al-Ahqaf 46:15]
This even takes precedence over jihad if there is a conflict between the two.
‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘As (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: “A man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and asked him for permission to participate in jihad. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him, ‘Are your parents alive?’ He said, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘Then your jihad is with them.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2842; Muslim, 2549)

Not offending them or saying or doing anything that they dislike.

 Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“say not to them a word of disrespect” [al-Isra 17:23]
 If Allah has forbidden us even to say “uff” [paraphrased as “a word of disrespect” in the translation of the meaning of the verse] to our parents, then how about someone who hits them?!

Spending on her if she is in need and does not have a husband who can spend on her or if her husband is poor; for the righteous, spending on one’s mother and feeding her is more precious than feeding their own children.

 Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Three men went out walking and rain began to fall on them. They entered a cave in a mountain, then a rock fell (blocking the entrance to the cave). They said to one another, Pray to Allah by virtue of the best deeds that you have done. One of them said, O Allah, my parents were elderly and I used to go out and tend to my flocks, then I would milk them and bring the milk to my parents for them to drink from it, then I would give some to my children. One night I came home late and found them sleeping. I did not want to wake them, and the children were crying at my feet. I kept waiting and the children kept crying until dawn broke. O Allah, if You knew that I did that for Your sake, then open a way for us through which we can see the sky. So a way was opened for them…” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2102; Muslim, 2743)

Obeying her when she tells you to do something good. But if she tells you to do something bad, such as shirk, then there should be no obedience to any created being if it involves disobedience to the Creator.

Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“But if they (both) strive with you to make you join in worship with Me others that of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not; but behave with them in the world kindly” [Luqman 31:15]

After one’s mother dies, it is Sunnah to fulfil any vows that she had made, and to give charity and perform Hajj and ‘Umrah on her behalf.

 Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both)  narrated that a woman from Juhaynah came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: “My mother vowed to go for Hajj, but she died before she did so. Can I perform Hajj on her behalf?” He said, “Yes, perform Hajj on her behalf. Do you not think that if your mother owed a debt that you would pay it off for her? Fulfill her debt to Allah, for Allah is more deserving that what is owed to Him should be paid.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1754)

After she dies, it is also Sunnah to honour her by maintaining ties with those whom she used to keep in touch with, such as her relatives and friends.

‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of righteous deeds is for a man to keep in touch with his father’s friends after he dies.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2552)
Rights of children over mother 

That she should take care of you when you are a child, breastfeeding and nurturing you. This is a well-known aspect of human nature that has been handed down from the beginning of creation.

 Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“The mothers shall give suck to their children for two whole years, (that is) for those (parents) who desire to complete the term of suckling” [al-Baqarah 2:233]

She should bring you up in a righteous manner, for she will be responsible for that before Allah on the Day of Resurrection. You are part of her “flock” and she is your “shepherd”.

 ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar said: “I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: ‘Each of you is a shepherd and each of you is responsible for his flock. The imam is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock. A man is the shepherd of his family and is responsible for his flock. A woman is the shepherd of her husband’s house and is responsible for her flock. A servant is the shepherd of his master’s wealth and is responsible for his flock.’ I think that he said, ‘A man is the shepherd of his father’s wealth and is responsible for his flock. Each of you is a shepherd and each of you is responsible for his flock.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 853; Muslim, 1829)
Permissible things that it is permissible for you to do without your mother interfering in your affairs

She does not have the right to make decisions about what you should like with regard to permissible things over which she has no authority, such as food, drink, clothing, means of transportation, etc.
Neither does she have the right to interfere in your choice of a wife – if she is righteous – so long as you are not disobeying Allah with regard to that. At the same time it is prescribed (by Islam) that you should try to please her even in your choice of a wife, if she advises you in a way that will not harm you.

With regard to her interfering with such matters as when you go out of the house or come in, or your going out in the evening with your friends: both parents have to watch their children with regard to this, so as to keep control of things and not let their children be led astray by bad company. 
In most cases, when young people are corrupted it is because of bad company. Concerning this matter, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “A man will follow the way of his close friend, so let each of you look to who his close friends are.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2387; Abu Dawud, 4833. This hadith was classed as hasan by al-Tirmidhi and as sahih by al-Nawawi, as stated in Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi, 7/42).
Parents also have to watch when their child goes out and when he comes in, because they should not give him free rein, especially if he is not righteous.
You have to acknowledge their status and respect them and offer them good companionship, even if they give you a hard time with regard to things that Allah has made permissible for you. Allah has commanded us to treat our parents well even if they are non-Muslims who call you to disbelief, so how about if they are calling us to something which they sincerely believe to be good? Even if sometimes it causes you some difficulty with regard to something that is permissible for you, the best thing to do is to obey them and do what they want. Even though you do not have to do this, it is a kind of sacrifice and giving them preference, because they are the most deserving of being given good treatment. In the Quran, Allah has mentioned obedience to parents immediately after worship of Him, in order to demonstrate the high status afforded obedience to parents.
When does the father have the final say?
Your father has the final say concerning everything that comes under his responsibility. For example, he is the one who decides in which school a child who is dependent on him will study. The father also has the final say concerning anything to do with his property, such as your using his car, taking his money, etc.
With regard to a son who is grown up and independent, he makes his own decisions concerning things that Allah has permitted. It is prescribed for him to please his father so long as that does not conflict with his obedience towards Allah. The son must continue to respect his father no matter how old he gets, because this has to do with honouring one’s parents and treating them kindly. It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar said: “I never climbed onto the roof of a house in which my father was.”
 If a father tells a child to do something good, or to stop doing something that is permissible, he should obey him so long as that will not cause the son any harm.
How to tell mother to create a bit of space of freedom for you
With regard to how you can tell your mother that you want more freedom, this can be achieved by words and by deeds.

Deeds

 After proving to your mother in practical terms that you are no longer the child whom she used to know and that you have become a man who is able to bear responsibility and you behave like a man in front of her, if she sees that repeatedly, she will trust you. Then things will start to get better and you will have a higher status in your mother’s eyes.

Words

By clearly proving, quietly discussing and speaking softly, giving examples of your sound attitude. May Allah open your mother’s heart so that she will deal with you as a wise, mature, sensible, adult man, so long as you are like that.
We ask Allah to guide us, you and your parents to the straight path. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.

    suffering a relapse after he repented","I was brought up in a good Muslim household
      in the West. Unfortunately in my teenage years I allowed myself to be led astray by
      Shaitaan and committed many mortal sins for a number of years, even going out of Islam. I
      have tried to repent and reform over the last couple of years. I perform all the five
      pillars, give sadaqa generously, get involved with dawah and try to be helpful to Muslims.
      I am good to my wife and parents. However my heart is very shaky indeed. Sometimes I am convinced of the
      truth but usually I am ""sumum bukmun"". I find that my heart is very arrogant,
      evil and hates the Truth. I have tried hard to repress these negative feelings but cannot
      fully overcome them. I want to become a Muslim again but am at the point of resigning
      myself to a life of Taaghoot. I have read countless books and been to many lectures but I
      have made no progress. I want to succeed in this life and be saved from the Fire. What can
      I do? Do I need to do the Shahada again?  Please help me.",,,"Praise be to Allah.His Excellence Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz
    (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked the following question:
I am a young man who has wronged myself by committing many sins. I do
    not even pray in the mosque, I have never fasted all of Ramadaan in my life, and I do
    other bad things. Often I have promised myself that I will repent, but then I go back to
    my bad ways. I make friends with young people in our neighbourhood who are not very good,
    and most of my brothers’ friends who come to our house are also not righteous. Allaah
    knows that I have wronged myself by committing so many sins and doing bad things, but
    every time I resolve to repent, I go back to my old ways again. I hope that you can show
    me a way to get closer to my Lord and keep me from doing these bad things.
He (may Allaah have mercy on him) replied:
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Say: “O ‘Ibaadi (My slaves) who have transgressed
    against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of
    Allaah, verily, Allaah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful”
    [al-Zumar 39:54] 
The scholars agreed that this aayah was revealed concerning those who
    repent; whoever repents sincerely from his sins, Allaah will forgive him all his sins, as
    this aayah says, and as Allaah says elsewhere (interpretation of the meaning):
“O you who believe! Turn to Allaah with sincere repentance! It
    may be that your Lord will expiate from you your sins, and admit you into Gardens under
    which rivers flow (Paradise)” [al-Tahreem 66:8]
In this aayah, Allaah made the forgiveness of sins and admittance to
    Paradise conditional upon sincere repentance, which includes giving up and avoiding sins,
    regretting the sins of the past, and sincerely resolving not to go back to them, out of
    reverence for Allaah, hoping for His reward and fearing His punishment.
One of the conditions of sincere repentance is that one should restore
    what is rightfully due to people whom you have wronged or asking for their forgiveness if
    the sin involved wronging them with regard to blood, wealth or honour. If it is not
    possible to ask your brother for forgiveness concerning his honour, then you must pray for
    him a lot, and speak of him in the best way you can in the places where you gossiped about
    him, for good deeds expiate for bad deeds. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“… And all of you beg Allaah to forgive you all, O
    believers, that you may be successful.” [al-Noor 24:31]. In this aayah, Allaah
    made the connection between success and tawbah, which indicates that the one who repents
    will be successful and blessed. If the one who repents follows his repentance with faith
    and righteous deeds, Allaah will wipe out his sayi’aat (evil deeds) and
    replace them with hasanaat (good deeds). Allaah says in Soorat al-Furqaan,
    after mentioning shirk, killing without just cause and zina (unlawful sexual
    intercourse) (interpretation of the meaning):
“The torment will be doubled to him on the Day of Resurrection,
    and he will abide therein in disgrace; Except those who repent and believe (in Islamic
    Monotheism), and do righteous deeds; for those, Allaah will change their sins into good
    deeds, and Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful” [al-Furqaan 25:69-70]
One of the means of repentance is praying to Allaah for guidance and
    strength, asking Him to bless you with repentance. Allaah is the One Who says
    (interpretation of the meaning):
“And your Lord said: “Invoke Me [i.e. believe in My
    Oneness (Islamic Monotheism) and ask Me for anything] I will respond to your
    (invocation)…” [Ghaafir 40:60]
And He says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And when My slaves ask you (O Muhammad) concerning Me, then
    (answer them), I am indeed near (to them by My Knowledge). I respond to the invocations of
    the supplicant when he calls on Me (without any mediator or intercessor).”
    [al-Baqarah 2:186]
Another of the means of repentance which will help you adhere to it is
    keeping company with good people and following their example of righteous conduct, and
    keeping away from bad company. It was reported in a saheeh hadeeth that the Messenger of
    Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
“A man will be on the path of his close friends, so pay attention
    to who you make friends with.”
And he 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
“The likeness of a righteous companion is that of the seller of
    musk: either he will give you a gift, or you will buy something from him, or you will
    smell a pleasant fragrance from him. And the likeness of an evil companion is that of the
    man who works the bellows: either he will burn your garment, or you will smell an
    unpleasant odour from him.” 
(Majmoo’ Fataawaa Samaahat al-Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez
    ibn Baaz; Fataawaa al-‘Aqeedah, part 2, p. 640)
With regard to renewing your Islam: if you have done something that
    takes you out of Islam altogether, then you have to pronounce the Shahaadatayn and
    re-enter Islam because you had left it. If what you have done is a major sin which does
    not, however, take you out of Islam, then it is sufficient for you to repent according to
    the conditions referred to above. Do not despair of the Mercy of Allaah; follow the path
    of salvation. May Allaah give us and you the strength to do all that is good. May Allaah
    bless our Prophet Muhammad.
We ask Allaah to bless us and you with sincere repentance and to forgive
    us and you. May He show you the way out from your problem and bring us and you together in
    Gardens of Delight (Paradise) facing one another on thrones [cf. Al-Hijr 15:47]. Ameen.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
