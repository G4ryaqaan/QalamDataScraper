6308,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6308,Forgiveness of Victim of Gossip,"Is it obligatory for a person who has gossiped about a Muslim and wants to repent to Allah to seek the forgiveness of the person about whom he gossiped? Does he have to tell him what he said about him behind his back if he thinks that telling him about it may make him hate him? In this case does he have to tell him, or is it sufficient to ask his forgiveness without telling him what was said?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The correct view –and Allah knows best – is that he should not tell him that he has gossiped about him if he does not know; it is sufficient just to ask Allah for forgiveness for the sin and to ask for forgiveness for his brother to counteract the harm caused by his gossiping about him.
There follow some of the scholars’ opinions on this matter:
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mecy on him) said in his book al-Adhkar: “Know that everyone who commits a sin must hasten to repent from it. Repentance in the case of a sin involving the rights of Allah (i.e., in which no other person is affected) requires the following three conditions:
He must give up the sin immediately
He must regret what he has done
He must resolve not to do it again.
With regard to repentance from a sin that affects the rights of other people, these three conditions are also required, and to them is added a fourth: he must restore to people what is due to them and settle the matter, or else ask for forgiveness and find a way to relieve himself of this burden of sin.
The repentance of the backbiter must meet these four conditions, because backbiting or gossip affects other people, so he has to seek the forgiveness of the person about whom he gossiped.
Is it sufficient for him to say: ‘I gossiped about you so please forgive me’, or does he have to tell him what he said about him?
The companions of al-Shafi’i (may Allah have mercy on them) had two views:
The first was that he has to tell him, because if he forgives him without being told what was said, it does not count, as in the case of forgiving someone with regard to an unknown amount of money.
The second was that he does not have to tell him, because this is something that can be forgiven, so he does not have to tell him what he said, unlike the case with money.
The first view is more correct, because a person could forgive some type of gossip but not others.
If the person about whom you gossiped is dead or is not present, it is not possible to ask him for forgiveness, but the scholars said: you should pray a lot for him to be forgiven, and make du’a (supplicate) for him, and do lots of good deeds.
Know that the person who was spoken about should forgive him for that, but he does not have to, because this is a voluntary giving up of one's rights. The choice is up to him, but it is strongly encouraged (mustahab) for him to forgive him, so that his Muslim brother may be relieved of the consequences of his sin and he himself may attain a great reward from Allah and the love of Allah. (This was the view of al-Shafi’i)
Ibn Muflih said in al-Adab al-Shara’iyyah: “It was said that if the person who was wronged by the gossip knows about it (then you cannot do anything about that), otherwise you should make du’a for him and pray for forgiveness, but he should not be told. Shaykh Taqiy al-Deen mentioned that this was the view of the majority.
More than one scholar said: if a person who slandered or gossiped about another repents before the person comes to know about it, is it a condition of his repentance that he should tell the person and ask for his forgiveness? There are two views.
Al-Qadi said that he does not have to do that, because of the reports narrated by Abu Muhammad al-Khallal with his isnad (chain of narration) from Anas, and attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Whoever backbites about a man then asks for forgiveness for him, his backbiting will be forgiven” and “The kafarah (expiation) of the one who gossips about another is that he should ask for forgiveness for him.” These two ahadeeth (reports) are not saheeh (authentic) in their transmission from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Another reason is that by telling the person what was said, this may make him hate him. Al-Qadi said: this is not permissible. This was also the view of Shaykh Abd al-Qadir.
Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said in his book Bahjat al-Majalis: “Hudhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The kafarah (expiation) of the one who gossips about another is that he should ask for forgiveness for him.” ‘Abd-Allah ibn al-Mubarak said to Sufyaan ibn ‘Uyaynah: the repentance for backbiting is that you should pray for forgiveness for the one you gossiped about. Sufyan said: rather you should ask for forgiveness for what you said about him. Ibn al-Mubarak said: do not hurt him twice. Shaykh Taqiy al-Deen ibn al-Salah al-Shafi’i also said in his Fatawa something like that which was said by Ibn al-Mubarak.
After mentioning these two reports on this issue, Shaykh Taqiy al-Deen said: “Any talk about a person’s honour is either truthful gossip or a fabricated lie. In either case it is slander, because if slander is true then it is gossip and if it is not true then it is a false accusation.”
Our companions were of the opinion that he should not tell him; rather he should make du’a for him which will be a good deed towards him, to make up for his wrongdoing towards him, as was stated in the reports.
It is clear that what Shaykh Taqiy al-Deen (may Allah have mercy on him) said about telling the person hurting him twice makes sense, and that there is the fear that it could lead to conflict, hatred and a breakdown of the relationship between them.

6315,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6315,"The one who causes
    the divorce of a woman","A man married without the knowledge of
      his parents and (first) wife, and they thought that the woman was not a Sunni, so his
      mother insisted that he should divorce her and she urged his father to force him to
      divorce her. So he divorced her in obedience to them. Then his mother regretted asking him
      to do that, and she is asking whether there is any sin on her and if so, what the kafaarah
      (expiation) is.",,,"Praise be to Allah.According to the most correct opinion, it is not
    permissible to divorce a woman without a valid reason, because this is unjust to the woman
    and causes the blessing of marriage to be lost for no reason, and the break up of a family
    with which Allaah had blessed the sons of Adam, as Allaah says (interpretation of the
    meaning):
And among His Signs is this, that He created for you wives
    from among yourselves, that you may find repose in them, and He has put between you
    affection and mercy. Verily, in that are indeed signs for a people who reflect
    [al-Room 30:21]
Obedience to one's parents should only be with regard to things that
    are right and good, that Allaah and His Messenger love. It is not permissible to obey them
    with regard to something that Allaah and His Messenger have forbidden, as the Prophet 
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: There is no obedience to anyone if
    it involves disobedience towards Allaah; obedience is only with regard to what is right
    and good. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim from Ali, may Allaah be pleased
    with him). 
    And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning);
But if they (both) strive with you to make you join in worship
    with Me others that of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not; but behave with
    them in the world kindly, and follow the path of him who turns to Me in repentance and in
    obedience [Luqmaan 31:15]
No kafaarah is required from either the mother or the father,
    apart from tawbah (repentance) and istighfaar (seeking forgiveness); they
    should also try to put matters right and bring people together again. If they do this,
    they will have a reward (from Allaah). Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
There is no good in most of their secret talks save (in) him
    who orders Sadaqah (charity in Allaahs Cause), or Maroof (Islâmic Monotheism
    and all the good and righteous deeds which Allaah has ordained), or conciliation between
    mankind; and he who does this, seeking the good Pleasure of Allaah, We shall give him a
    great reward [al-Nisa 4:114]

6333,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6333,How was ‘Eesaa (peace be upon him) Created?,Can you tell me how Nabi (Prophet) Isa was created in relation to his conception?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Allaah commanded Jibreel to blow through the neck of
        Maryam’s garment, and this breath went down and by the will of Allaah entered her
        womb, so it became a soul that Allaah had created. Allaah has explained how He created
        ‘Eesaa (peace be upon him), as He said (interpretation of the meaning):“And she who guarded her chastity [Virgin Maryam
      (Mary)], We breathed into (the sleeves of) her (shirt or garment) [through Our Rooh 
      Jibreel (Gabriel)]” [al-Anbiya’ 21:91]
      Then Allaah explains that the Rooh reached her
      womb, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
      “And Maryam (Mary), the daughter of ‘Imraan who guarded
      her chastity. And We breathed into (the sleeve of her shirt or her garment) through Our
      Rooh [i.e. Jibreel (Gabriel)]”. [al-Tahreem 66:12]
The aayah (interpretation of the meaning):
“(The angel) said: ‘I am only a messenger from your Lord,
      (to announce) to you the gift of a righteous son’” [Maryam 19:19] –
      indicates that the one who blew into her was Jibreel, who does not do anything except by
      the command of Allaah.
Some commentaries have been narrated from some Mufassireen (commentators) suggesting
        that her pregnancy lasted only a few seconds, but this is not clearly indicated by the
        texts. If that had been the case, it would have been a miracle in and of itself: people
        would have accepted that this was not a normal pregnancy as experienced by women, and they
        would not have accused her of fornication, as they said (interpretation of the meaning):
“O Mary! Indeed you have brought a thing Fariyy (a mighty
      thing)” [Maryam 19:27]
      There follow comments on this matter from two of
      the great Mufassireen, one from the past – Ibn Katheer, may Allaah have mercy on him,
      and one from more recent times – al-Shanqeeti, may Allaah have mercy on him.
      Imaam Ibn Katheer, may Allaah have mercy on him, said:
      The Mufassireen differed as to the length of time (Maryam was) pregnant
      with ‘Eesaa (peace be upon him). The best known view of the majority is that she
      carried him for nine months… Ibn Jurayj said: al-Mugheerah told me, from ‘Utbah
      ibn ‘Abd-Allaah al-Thaqafi, that he heard Ibn ‘Abbaas being asked about the
      pregnancy of Maryam, and he said: no sooner had she conceived him then she gave birth!
This is strange (ghareeb), and it was based on what might be the
      apparent meaning of the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): 
      “So she conceived him,and she withdrew with him to a far place. And the pains of childbirth drove her
      to the trunk of a date palm” [Maryam 19:22].
The prefix “fa” here [in the phrase fa ajaa’ahaa
      al- makhaad - And the pains of childbirth drove her] indicates a succession of events,
      but things follow one another according to their own merits and characteristics, as in the
      aayah (interpretation of the meaning):
“And indeed We created man (Adam) out of an extract of clay
      (water and earth). Thereafter We made him (the offspring of Adam) as a Nutfah (mixed drops
      of the male and female sexual discharge and lodged it) in a safe lodging (womb of the
      woman). Then We made the Nutfah into a clot (a piece of thick coagulated blood), then We
      made the clot into a little lump of flesh, then We made out of that little lump of flesh
      bones” [al-Mu’minoon 23:12]
Here the fa’ [translated as ‘then’] implies a
      succession of events according to their own merits and characteristics. It was reported in
      al-Saheehayn (al-Bukhaari, 3208, Muslim, 2643) that “between each stage there are
      forty days.”
And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“See you not that Allaah sends down water (rain) from the sky,
      and then [fa’] the earth becomes green?” [al-Hajj 22:63].
The apparent meaning – although Allaah is able to do all
      things – is that her pregnancy was like that of other women… When Maryam felt
      that her people were becoming suspicious about her, she hid herself away from them “[in]
      a far place” [Maryam 19:22], i.e. far away so that she would not see them and
      they would not see her… she hid away from them and “placed a screen (to
      screen herself) from them” [Maryam 19:17 – interpretation of the meaning].
      So no one could see her and she could not see anyone else. (Tafseer Ibn Katheer,
      3/122).
Shaykh al-Shanqeeti (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:
We will not mention all the views of the scholars concerning the length
      of time Maryam carried ‘Eesaa (peace be upon him), because of the lack of evidence
      (daleel) for these views. The strongest opinion is that her pregnancy was like that of
      other women, even though its beginning was miraculous. And Allaah knows best. (Adwaa’
      al-Bayaan, 4/264)
Some ignorant people interpret the aayah (interpretation of the
        meaning):
“So when I have fashioned him and breathed into him (his) soul
      created by Me” [Saad 38:72] as meaning that the Messiah was a part of the spirit
      of Allaah! 
[The original Arabic says min roohi, lit. ‘of My
      spirit’]
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) explained that this
      interpretation is misguided, as he said:
With regard to the misinterpretation of the genitive (or possessive)
        construction [idaafah] in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):
“So when I have fashioned him and breathed into him (his) soul
      created by Me [min roohi, lit. ‘of My spirit’]” [Saad 38:72] – it
      should be known that when this construction appears in conjunction with the name of
      Allaah, may He be glorified, it may be one of two types:
(The first) is qualities that cannot stand alone, such as knowledge,
      power, words, hearing, sight. Here the attribute is attached in a genitive construction (idaafah)
      to the One Who is described in this manner. So His knowledge, His words, His will, His
      power, His life are all attributes or qualities which are not created (because this refers
      to His Essence); the same applies to His Face and His Hand, may He be glorified.
The second kind are things which exist separately and are mentioned in idaafah
      (genitive construction), such as (His) house, (His) she-camel, (His) slave, (His)
      Messenger, (His) spirit. Here the created thing is connected by the genitive construction
      to its Creator, but in this case the idaafah implies that the thing mentioned is
      special and is honoured, and is thus distinguished from other things. For example, the
      House of Allaah [meaning the Ka’bah] – although all houses belong to Allaah
      – and the she-camel of Allaah – although all camels belong to Allaah and are
      created by Him. This idaafah is connected to the idea of His Divinity (uloohiyah),
      which implies that he loves and honours the thing so described. In contrast, idaafah
      in the general sense has to do with His Lordship (ruboobiyyah), which implies that
      He created and formed it. So the general kind of idaafah implies that He is the
      Creator of that thing, whilst the specific kind of idaafah implies that Allaah has
      chosen that thing. Allaah creates what He wills and chooses some of His creation, as He
      says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And your Lord creates whatsoever He wills and chooses”
      [al-Qasas 28:68]
So in this case – the phrase min roohi (lit. ‘of
      My spirit’), the idaafah (genitive construction) is of the specific type, not
      the general type, and it does not refer to the attributes of Allaah. Think about this
      matter, for it will save you from the many errors into which people have fallen by the
      will of Allaah.
(al-Rooh, p. 154, 155)
In conclusion, the description of ‘Eesaa (peace be
      upon him) as the spirit (rooh) of Allaah is by way of honouring him. This idaafah
      (whereby the word rooh (spirit) is connected in a genitive construction to the Name
      of Allaah) does not serve to ascribe an attribute to the One Who is so described, as is
      the case in the phrases “the hand of Allaah”, “the Face of Allaah.” On
      the contrary, it connects the created being in a genitive construction to the Creator, as
      the Ka’bah is described as the House of Allaah, and the she-camel – which was
      the miracle that Allaah gave to His Prophet Saalih (peace be upon him) – was
      described as the she-camel of Allaah.

6356,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6356,Admiring oneself after doing a good deed,"Sometimes a person finds himself filled with self-admiration or showing off after doing a good deed or act of worship, and he is scared that this will cancel out what he has done. What do you advise?",,,"Praise be to Allah.If a person feels self admiration after doing something good or fears that he may show off, he should ward that off and resist it by seeking refuge with Allah from it, and saying “Allahumma inni a’oodhu bika an ushrika bika wa ana a’lam, wa’staghfiruka lima laa a’lam (O Allah, I seek refuge with you from knowingly associating anything with You, and I seek Your forgiveness for that of which I am unaware)” – as was reported from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).
These kind of feelings happen to everyone, but you have to try to be sincere towards Allah, seek His forgiveness, and remember that there is no strength and no power except with Allah; if it were not for the help of Allah, you would not have been able to do this good deed, so to Allah be praise in the beginning and at the end.
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to Mu’aadh ibn Jabal: “O Mu’aadh, by Allah indeed I love you, and I advise you, O Mu’aadh, do not forget at the end of every prayer to say: Allahumma a’inni ‘ala dhikrika wa shukrika wa husni ‘ibaaditika (O Allah, help me to remember You, give thanks to You and worship You in the best way).”
(Narrated by Ahmad, Abu Dawood, al-Nasaa’i, and others; it is saheeh).
Do not forego doing good deeds for fear of showing off, because this is one of the tricks that the Shaytaan uses to weaken people’s resolve and stop them from doing things that Allah loves and is pleased with.
As for merely feeling happy that one has done a good deed, this does not contradict sincerity and faith, for Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Say: “In the Bounty of Allâh, and in His Mercy (i.e. Islâm and the Qur’ân); therein let them rejoice.” That is better than what (the wealth) they amass” [Yoonus 10:58] – meaning, if he attains guidance, faith and righteous deeds, and the mercy resulting from that overwhelms him and he feels joy and success as a result. Hence Allah commanded us to rejoice over such things.
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If your good deeds make you happy and your bad deeds make you sad, then you are a believer.”
(Narrated by Ahmad, Ibn Majaah and others from the hadeeth of Abu Umaamah; it is a saheeh hadeeth).
By the same token, if people praise you for your good deed, then this is a portion of the glad tidings of the Hereafter, which Allah gives a person in this world. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was asked, “What do you think if a man does a good deed and the people praise him for it?” He said: “That is the portion of the glad tidings for the believer which he is given in this world.”
(Narrated by Muslim from the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him).
So this praise is a sign that Allah is pleased with him and loves him, so He makes him dear to other people.

6366,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6366,Can the khateeb beinterrupted in his Khutbah on Friday?,"The sanctity of the hour of Jumu-ah, can this be disrupted at any stage? If so when and for what reasons?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: speaking during the khutbah when the khateeb is speaking on the minbar is haraam and the one who does that is committing a sin, even if he speaks words of Dhikr (remembrance of Allah) at this time.
 Jumu’ah should be a time of sitting still and keeping quiet, and the worshipper should be humble in body and soul and listen to the exhortation and knowledge which the general Muslim public needs to hear. It is not permissible to speak even if it is to enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil. Even though this (enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil) is one of the most important duties of the Muslim, it is not allowed at this time (during the khutbah) and one cannot even say “Shush!” or “Listen!” The evidence (daleel) for that is as follows: 
It was reported from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If you say to your companion ‘Listen!’ whilst the imaam is preaching on Friday, you have spoken laghw (idle talk).” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 892; Muslim, 851).
 Look – may Allah bless you – even if you say to a person, “Listen!” – which is enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil – Islam counts this as laghw (idle talk) which is forbidden at the time of Jumu’ah.
 The matter is even more serious than that. Listen to the hadeeth which comes next:
 It was reported that Abu’l-Dardaa’ said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sat on the minbar and addressed the people, and recited an aayah. Ubayy ibn Ka’b was beside me and I said to him, ‘O Ubayy, when was this aayah revealed?’ He refused to answer me. I asked him again and he ignored me, and I asked him again and he still ignored me, refusing to speak to me until the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had come down from the minbar. Then Ubayy said to me, ‘All you got from your Jumu’ah was speaking idle talk (laghw).’ When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) left, I went to him and told him what had happened. He said, ‘Ubayy spoke the truth. If you hear your imaam speaking, then listen to him until he finishes.’” (Narrated by Ibn Maajah, 1111; Ahmad, 20780. Classed as saheeh by al-Busayri and by Shaykh al-Albaani in Tamaam al-Minnah, p. 338). 
Asking about an aayah on the day of Jumu’ah cancels out the reward of Jumu’ah, so how about people who speak about their business or crops or other worldly matters? Another kind of negligence on some people’s part is when they make the khutbah a time for taking a nap and cannot enjoy their sleep except during the time of Jumu’ah.
 Even saying “Yarhamuk Allah” (may Allah have mercy on you) to someone who sneezes, or returning salaams during the time of Jumu’ah is not permitted. Al-Nawawi says in al-Majmoo’: 
The saheeh texts forbid saying “Yarhamuk Allah” to someone who sneezes and returning salaams. (Tamaam al-Minnah, p. 335).
 The same applies to all adhkaar (dhikr) such as istighfaar (seeking forgiveness) or tasbeeh (saying Subhaan Allah) etc. It is not permissible to say them out loud even though this is dhikr. The khutbah is a kind of dhikr or remembrance of Allah, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“O you who believe (Muslims)! When the call is proclaimed for the Salaat (prayer) on the day of Friday (Jumu’ah prayers), come to the remembrance of Allah…” [al-Jumu’ah 62:9]
This includes the khutbah and the prayer; both of them are remembrance of Allah (dhikr). Other kinds of dhikr such as tasbeeh etc., are Sunnah and may be done at all other times; the khutbah and listening to it, on the other hand, form an obligatory (waajib) form of dhikr which is prescribed for a short and specific time, during which focusing on the khutbah takes precedence over focusing on any other kind of good deed or worship.
 Similarly, saying “Ameen” to the imaam’s du’aa’ and sending blessings on the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) if he is mentioned during the khutbah, should be done silently by the members of thecongregation, not out loud.
 Secondly: the ban on speaking and making dhikr applies whilst the khateeb is actually speaking on the minbar. If he is on the minbar but he is not speaking, then there is no prohibition on speaking and remembering Allah (making dhikr), because it says in the hadeeth quoted above, “…whilst the imaam is preaching…”
 So the ban on speaking is confined to the time when the imaam is actually giving the khutbah.
 Concerning the hadeeth, “When the khateeb ascends the minbar, there should be no prayer and no speaking” – this is a false hadeeth with no basis. (al-Silsilat al-Da’eefah, p. 87).
 Thirdly: occasions when it is permitted to speak or move whilst the khateeb is speaking from the minbar:
If a person is faced with some need which he cannot put off dealing with, such as drowsiness, the need to relieve himself, or pain which means he has to move. The evidence (daleel) for that is the hadeeth: “If any one of you become drowsy in the mosque on the day of Jumu’ah, let him move from where he is to another spot.” (Narrated by Abu Dawood, 1119; al-Tirmidhi, 526. Classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 468).
Al-Bayhaqi added the phrase “and whilst the imaam is giving the khutbah”. This was also classed as saheeh by al-Albaani.
It is permissible to do things which are permitted even during the prayer, such as guiding a blind person so that he does not fall; or paying attention to the necessities of life in matters which may lead to death or may affect the common good – such as the worshippers asking the imaam to pray for rain for them.
 
It was reported that Anas ibn Maalik said: a man entered the mosque on the day of Jumu’ah from the direction of the courtyard whilst the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was standing and giving the khutbah. He turned to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, “O Messenger of Allah, our wealth (livestock) has been destroyed and our means of transportation (camels) has been cut off; pray to Allah to help us.” So the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) raised his hands… (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 967; Muslim, 897).
It is permissible for a member of the congregation to correct the imaam if he makes a mistake in an aayah, or to prompt him if necessary, whilst he is standing on the minbar. It is also permissible to refute the khateeb if he says something that amounts to shirk, bid’ah (innovation) or munkar (reprehensible error) during the khutbah, so long as that will not lead to a greater evil or fitnah happening in the mosque. If that is the case, then one should wait until after the khutbah and then speak to the imaam, pointing out what is wrong. If the imaam speaks words of falsehood, it is not obligatory to listen to him. It was reported that some of the Salaf used to speak when the oppressor al-Hajjaaj was cursing ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) on the minbar; they said, “We were not commanded to listen to this!”
It is permissible to pray Tahiyyat al-Masjid (two rak’ahs “greeting the mosque”); indeed, this is obligatory, even if the khateeb is on the minbar giving the khutbah.
This is because of the hadeeth of Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah who said: a man came whilst the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was addressing the people on the day of Jumu’ah. He said, “Have you prayed, O So and so?” He said, “No.” he said, “Stand up and pray two rak’ahs.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 888; Muslim, 875).
If a person sees another person talking, it is not permissible to tell him to be quiet by speaking to him, as stated above, but one can indicate to him to be quiet by making a gesture, such as placing one's finger on one’s lips.

But now I have a new problem, the girl does not want to marry me any more because I'm from India and she's from pakistan and she feels that her mother will not allow us to marry and will kick her out. Does her mother have the right to stop us from getting married just because we'er from different countries? This whole situation is making me feel extremely upset. Its been about 2 weeks since it happened and I feel extremely depressed, I been constanly crying, I haven't eaten anything, I just can't get any sleep and I feel like I want to kill my self. I just can't cope with this situation any longer, what am I to do? I need help and your the only reliable source I can turn to, I am desperate for help. Please brother answer my questions, I just can't bear this pain any longer. Thank you, and any answer will be GREATLY appreciated.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
""And do not kill yourselves. Surely, Allaah is Most merciful to you. And whoever commits that through aggression and injustice, We shall cast him into the Fire"" [al-Nisa' 4:29-30]

No matter what psychological pressure or extreme distress befalls him, the Muslim cannot go ahead and kill himself, because he knows that the punishment for that is Hell and a painful torment, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
""Whoever throws himself down from a mountain and kills himself, he will be in the Fire of Hell throwing himself down for ever and ever. Whoever drinks poison and kills himself will have the poison in his hand, drinking it in the Fire of Hell for ever and ever. Whoever kills himself with a piece of iron [a weapon] will have that piece of iron in his hand, stabbing himself in the stomach with it in the Fire of Hell forever and ever."" (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5778).

Starving oneself to death by refusing food is also a kind of suicide and deliberately killing oneself. How can a Muslim who believes in Allaah and the Last Day think of trying to move from the suffering of this world to the suffering of the Hereafter, which is more severe and more long-lasting? No sane person would do this. And for what? For a woman, when you could always find another woman to marry, for there are many women besides this one. Moreover, circumstances may change, and they may change their minds and agree to the marriage after a while. You could look for a college or school in your country that is only for women, which your wife could join, and that would solve a part of the problem. Whatever the case, you have to seek the help of Allaah and persevere with sabr (patience).
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
""And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty)."" [al-Talaaq 65:2]
""Allaah will grant after hardship, ease."" [al-Talaaq 65:7]

We also suggest that you refer to the book ""Alhomoom - Dealing with Worries and Stress"", which is to be found on this web-site, and put into practise some of the things described therein, to calm you down and restore your equilibrium.

6377,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6377,He doesn’t like his wife to visit her family when her male cousins are there,"My question is regarding my wife. When she goes to visit her parents in their house, sometimes her male unmarried cousins stay the night in the same house. In these situations, I prefer to stay with her in her house and do not like her staying alone, even though our son, about 4, also stays with her and she does sleep in a separate room. 

Am I right to prohibit her from staying in her parent's house when this condition is not fulfilled (that is, I cannot stay the night with her, while the cousins do). Is this from Shariah or is this prohibiting what Allah has made lawful. Also, please note that I feel extremely uncomfortable about this situation, though my wife keeps telling me I should be more trusting. 

Another question is related as well. Is it right to prohibit my wife from travelling for pleasure and sight-seeing with her family when she is accompanied by her parents and brother but also the unmarried male cousins. Please note that I don't mind this when I'm around. But is it ok when I'm not with my wife. Again, I feel extremely jealous when this happens as I feel I should be the one taking her around and not any stranger, even if she's accompanied by her parents and brother. Can you please, again comment on whether this is normal or goes against the allowance given in the Shariah.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: I would like to remind you of what 
    the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “I have not left behind me any fitnah (temptation) that is more harmful to 
    men than women.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4808; Muslim, 2740, from the hadeeth of Usaamah ibn Zayd). 
Secondly: It is permissible for a woman to be 
    in her father’s house when there is a non-mahram present, so long as there is no fear of haraam mixing or of the fitnah (temptation) that may 
    happen as a result of that. 
But if there is no guarantee that there will 
    be no mixing and no fitnah, then that is not permissible. It is even more haraam if the woman does not observe proper Islamic hijaab. 
Thirdly: a boy of four years of age is not 
    considered to be a mahram because the role of a mahram is to guard and protect the woman, and this cannot be done by a four year old child. So it 
    makes no difference whether this boy is there or not. 
Fourthly: if your wife’s father and brothers 
    take this man’s presence lightly and do not care if he is alone with your wife or if she takes off her hijaab in front of him, then it is not 
    permissible for you to leave your wife with them, because they are careless about protecting their daughter. The Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) said: “Beware of entering upon women.” A man from among the Ansaar said: “O Messenger of Allaah, what do you think of the 
    in-law?” He said, “The in-law is death.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari (4934) and Muslim (2172), from the hadeeth of ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Aamir). So you must 
    protect your wife and feel protective jealousy and pride (gheerah) where she is concerned, and not expose her to temptation. 
Fifthly: With regard to her going on trips, 
    there is nothing wrong with that if the place to which she is going is not one where immoral people meet, such as beaches and other places which 
    are very dubious, and so long as she will keep her hijaab on and stay far away from places of temptation. If you are worried that the presence of 
    that non-mahram man will be a cause of fitnah or may make her do something that Allaah has forbidden, then you must not allow your wife to travel 
    with them. This is the matter of praiseworthy protective jealousy (gheerah) that is loved by Allaah and His Messenger. If a man feels protective 
    jealousy towards his family he will stop them from committing immoral actions and anything that may lead to that. 
You should note that most of the disasters 
    that befall families come from friends or relatives, so try your best to protect your wife from that.

6383,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6383,Virtues of Zamzam Water,What is the status of Zamzam water? What are its virtues? Why are Muslims so keen on Zamzam water?,"Zamzam water is the best and noblest of all waters, the highest in status, the dearest to people, the most precious and valuable to them. For more, please see the detailed answer.","Status of Zamzam water


Virtues of Zamzam water","Praise be to Allah.Status of Zamzam water
Imam Ibn al-Qayyim al-Jawziyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
“Zamzam water is the best and noblest of all waters, the highest in status, the dearest to people, the most precious and valuable to them. It was dug by Jibril and is the water with which Allah quenched the thirst of Isma’il.
It was reported in Sahih Muslim that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to Abu Dharr, who had stayed near the Ka’bah and its coverings for forty days and nights with no food or drink other than (Zamzam): “How long have you been here?” Abu Dharr said: “I have been here for thirty days and nights.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Who has been feeding you?” He said, “I have had nothing but Zamzam water, and I have gotten so fat that I have folds of fat on my stomach. I do not feel any of the tiredness or weakness of hunger and I have not become thin.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Verily, it is blessed, it is food that nourishes.” (Narrated by Imam Muslim, 2473)
Other scholars added, with their own isnads, “… and a healing for sickness.”
This was narrated by al-Bazzar (1171, 1172) and al-Tabarani in al-Saghir (295). 
In Sunan Ibn Majah (al-Manasik, 3062), it was reported from Jabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The water of Zamzam is for whatever it is drunk for.” The Salaf and ‘ulama acted upon this Hadith. When ‘Abd-Allah ibn al-Mubarak went for Hajj, he came to Zamzam and said, “O Allah, Ibn Abi’l-Mawali told us from Muhammad ibn al-Munkadir from Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) that Your Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ‘The water of Zamzam is for whatever it is drunk for.’ I am drinking it to ward off thirst on the Day of Resurrection.” Ibn Abi’l-Mawali is thiqah (trustworthy) so the hadith is hasan (good).”
Virtues of Zamzam water
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
Myself and others tried seeking healing with Zamzam water and saw wondrous things. I sought healing with it from a number of illnesses, and I was healed by the permission of Allah. I saw someone who nourished himself with it for a number of days, half a month or more, and he did not feel hunger; he performed Tawaf along with the other people just as they did. And he told me that he consumed nothing but Zamzam water for forty days and he had the strength to have intercourse with his wife, to fast and to perform Tawaf numerous times.” (Zad al-Ma’ad, 4/319, 320)
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah preserve him) said:
“So you should have the intention of what you want to gain by drinking this water. He should drink his fill, i.e., fill his stomach with it until it is filled to the ribs, because this water is good. A hadith has been narrated concerning this: the difference between the believers and the hypocrites is drinking one’s fill of Zamzam water.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah in al-Manasik, 1017; al-Hakim, 1/472)
Al-Busairi said: 
“This is a sahih isnad; its men are mawthuqun [trustworthy].
This is because Zamzam water is not sweet; it is somewhat salty, and the believer only drinks this somewhat salty water out of faith, believing that there is barakah (blessing) in it. So when he drinks his fill of it, this is a sign of faith.” (Sharh al-Mumti’, 7/377, 378, 379)
Perhaps Allah did not make it sweet so that people would not forget that the meaning of drinking it is an act of worship. Whatever the case, its taste is fine and there is nothing wrong with it. We ask Allah to quench our thirst from the Cistern (al-Hawd) of His Prophet on the Day of the greatest thirst. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.

6388,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6388,To what extent can the husband’s relatives interfere in his wife’s life?,"What are the rights of the in-laws (the husband’s brothers and sisters) in Islam? Do the father- and mother-in-law have the right of obedience? Do they have the right to enter my room with or without permission? To what extent should I obey them with regard to my clothing, cooking, childcare, keeping house and going out of the house? Do they have the right to interfere in our marital life? Do they have any rights with regard to our work, where we live, education and the like? Do I have to ask their permission to visit my family? Do they have the right to know all the details about our life? Do I have to obey them and shake hands with my husband’s relatives? Do my husband and I have to attend weddings in which there are haraam things?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The wife does not have to obey anyone among her in-laws, whether that is her husband’s father, mother, brothers or sisters, in any matter, major or minor, unless they tell her to do something which is obligatory according to Islam, or forbid her to do something that is haraam. In such matters she has to obey, whether that comes from a relative or a stranger, an in-law or anyone else. 
With regard to the husband, she must obey him in matters that are right and proper, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means…”
[al-Nisa’ 4:34]
Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said, discussing some of the husband’s rights over his wife: 
Allah has given the husband rights and commanded the wife to obey him; He has forbidden her to disobey him because of the fact that he excels her and maintains her. Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 1/493 
It is not permissible for any of your in-laws to enter your room without your permission, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Enter not houses other than your own, until you have asked permission and greeted those in them; that is better for you, in order that you may remember”
[al-Noor 24:27]
If any of them enters your room with your permission but he is not one of your mahrams – such as your husband’s brother – then there has to be one of your mahrams present, so that there will be no haraam khulwah between you (i.e., being alone together). You must also observe full shar’i hijab, and be certain that there is no risk of falling into fitnah (temptation). 
Despite all these conditions, it is still better for him not to enter upon you in your room; this is purer for the heart and farthest removed from suspicion. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And when you ask (his wives) for anything you want, ask them from behind a screen, that is purer for your hearts and for their hearts”
[al-Ahzaab 33:53]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Beware of entering upon women.” A man from among the Ansaar said, “What about the in-law, O Messenger of Allah?” He said, “The in-law is death.” 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5232; Muslim, 2172. 
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
With regard to the Prophet’s words “The in-law is death,” what this means is that there is more fear with regard to him than anyone else, and evil is to be expected of him, and the fitnah (temptation) is greater because he is able to reach the woman and be alone with her without anyone denouncing that, unlike the case of one who is a stranger. What is meant by “in-law” (hamu) here is the relatives of the husband apart from his father/grandfather and sons/grandsons. Fathers/grandfathers and sons/grandsons are mahrams for his wife and it is permissible for them to be alone with her. The word “death” here does not refer to them. Rather what is meant is the brother, brother’s son, paternal uncle, cousin, etc, who are not mahrams. People are usually careless about this matter and a man may let his wife be alone with his brother. This is what is referred to by “death” and should be prevented more than her being alone with a stranger for the reasons mentioned above.  
They do not have the right to force you to do any of the things you mention, such as how to cook, how to dress or other things such as working and teaching etc, unless that is by way of advice and kind treatment, not by way of compulsion. 
It is not permissible for them to interfere in your and your husband’s private affairs, but if they convince your husband not to go out on trips and he tells you to stay in the house, then obey your husband, and be patient and seek reward. 
You do not have to ask permission from any of them to visit your family; that is not their right. You have to ask your husband’s permission, and if he gives you permission then you do not have to ask permission from any of them. 
They do not have the right to know the details of your life (you and your husband), and it is not permissible for your husband to tell them of any private or intimate matters between the two of you. 
Your husband has to honour his parents, and you should help him in that. You should not be the cause of a split between him and them. You will see the consequences of that in your children in sha Allah. 
Your husband’s visits to his parents should be on the basis of need. Something may happen to his parents which requires their son to visit them a great deal, such as sickness and the like. You husband has to pay attention to that. 
With regard to your serving them and doing housework, you are not obliged to do that, but if you do it as an act of kindness towards them, or to please your husband, that will be good and you will have the reward for that in sha Allah.  This is something that will raise your status in the eyes of your husband and his family in this world, and will raise you in status in the Hereafter too, in sha Allah. 
With regard to your living separately, your husband has to ensure that you have a place where you can live separately, but there is nothing wrong with his parents living in the same place with you if the house is big enough, and if that will not cause you any harm.
With regard to your life being under scrutiny, his parents have no right to dominate your life. Try to communicate in a proper manner with your husband and reach an understanding. If he can resolve the matter, all well and good, otherwise there is nothing wrong with you speaking to his family in a wise and mature manner. If they do not respond and the situation continues as it is, then be patient and seek reward from Allah. 
With regard to your shaking hands with men who are not your mahrams, this is haraam. There is no obedience to any created being if it involves disobedience towards the Creator. For more information on the ruling on shaking hands with a non-mahram, see question no. 21183. 
It is not permissible for your husband to go to wedding parties in which there is noise and sin. For more information see question no.  10957. 
Finally… 
Our advice to husbands is that they should honour their parents with regard to that which is right and proper, but they should not obey them if they transgress the limits set by Allah, or help them in wrongdoing, which includes mistreating their sons’ wives. They should discuss with them in a way that is better and not prevent them from obeying Allah. They should be strong in adhering to the truth and confront those who stand in the way of their implementing the laws of Allah in their homes, because the Muslim does not acknowledge any authority over him except the Qur’aan and Sunnah. They should also beware of those who call them to commit sin. 
If the husband thinks that the interests of sharee’ah dictate that he should keep his wife and his family apart, then there is nothing wrong with him doing that. 
We should be tolerant and be patient with one another, and we should not forget to be kind to one another. We should speak to one another in kindness and be patient,  and ward off evil with that which is better. We should speak well to the slaves of Allah until we meet Allah.

I have discovered through many months of careful study and furious debate with the Christianity I was raised with that Islam is no doubt the clear, complete, and true word of the Almighty God. I had a furious struggle with Jesus but as I began to look upon his actual words in my new testament I found that they were completely, 100% in line with the Qur'an! I have not taken shahada and to be honest, I'm still a bit hesitant to. It is hard to describe the feeling one has toward the Christian faith after it's been drilled into you from the time of your birth for a solid quarter of a century. I am taking arabic classes this summer and am planning to enroll at Cales in sana'a in Yemen next summer for further study. My question is do I really need to take the final step because the Qur'an says that Christians who are dutiful will receive their reward. I question my ability to adhere to all the elements of Shari'a. The prayers, the mannerisms, the relationships with women, diets, etc. Is it necessary that I take this step and if I did, would I have to take an Islamic name, or is that simply receomended? Following that, would the name Ishmael be appropriate? Thank you",,,"Praise be to Allah.We appreciate 
          your question and your efforts in studying and researching very much, 
          especially since you have achieved such great and true results. Although 
          we believe most strongly that it is essential to become Muslim and that 
          Islam is the only religion which Allaah will accept, because He revealed 
          it as the final religion and way, we do understand something of the 
          difficulty involved in leaving that which one is used to. But the wise 
          person knows that he has to follow the truth even if it becomes clear 
          to him after many years and even if he grew up in a different way. Hence 
          Allaah condemned those who refused to follow the truth because they 
          were following the ways of their forefathers. Allaah says (interpretation 
          of the meaning):""And when it is said to them: ""Come to what Allaah has 
          revealed and unto the Messenger (Muhammad for the verdict of that which 
          you have made unlawful)."" They say: ""Enough for us is that 
          which we found our fathers following,"" even though their fathers 
          had no knowledge whatsoever and nor guidance"" [al-Maa'idah 5:104]
          ""And when it is said to them: ""Follow that which Allaah has 
          sent down"", they say: ""Nay, we shall follow that which we 
          found our fathers (following)."" (Would they do so) even if Shaytaan 
          (Satan) invites them to the torment of the Fire?"" [Luqmaan 31:21]
          ""And similarly, We sent not a warner before you (O Muhammad) to 
          any town (people) but the luxurious ones among them said: ""We found 
          our fathers following a certain way and religion, and we will indeed 
          follow their footsteps."" (The warner) said: ""Even if I bring 
          you better guidance than that which you found your fathers following?"" 
          [al-Zukhruf 43:23-24]
          The matter will not be too difficult for you - in sha Allaah (if Allaah 
          wills) - for indeed if you believe in Islaam you will be believing in 
          all of the previous Prophets, and you will be believing in the Divine 
          Books. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):""O you who believe! Believe in Allaah, and His Messenger (Muhammad), 
          and the Book (the Qur'aan) which He has sent down to His Messenger, 
          and the Scripture which He sent down to those before (him); and whosoever 
          disbelieves in Allaah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, and the 
          Last Day, then indeed he has strayed far away"" [al-Nisa' 4:136]
          If you become Muslim, you will not be cut off from the sound roots, 
          for every Muslim believes in the Messiah 'Eesa (Jesus) - peace be upon 
          him - as a Prophet and Messenger, and he believes in the true Gospel 
          - before it was distorted - as a Book that was revealed by Allaah. Maybe 
          it will encourage you to know that everyone who used to believe in 'Eesa 
          and then believes in Muhammad  (peace 
          and blessings of Allaah be upon him) will have the reward twice. Hence 
          when the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
          of Allaah be upon him) sent his letter to Heraclius, the Christian ruler 
          of Byzantium, inviting him to Islam, he said:
          ""In the Name of Allaah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful. From Muhammad 
          the slave and Messenger of Allaah, to Heraclius the ruler of Byzantium. 
          Peace be upon those who follow true guidance. I invite you with the 
          call of Islam. Become Muslim and you will be safe. Become Muslim and 
          Allaah will give you your reward twice, but if you refuse, then the 
          sin of the husbandmen will be upon you. 'Say (O Muhammad): ""O 
          people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians): Come to a word that is 
          just between us and you, that we worship none but Allaah (Alone), and 
          that we associate no partners with Him, and that none of us shall take 
          others as lords besides Allaah. Then, if they turn away, say: ""Bear 
          witness that we are Muslims."" [Aal 'Imraan 64 - interpretation 
          of the meaning]."" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 2723)
          The Prophet of Islam, Muhammad  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""There are three 
          who will be given their reward twice: a man from among the People of 
          the Book who believed in his Prophet, then when he comes to know of 
          the Prophet [Muhammad]  (peace and 
          blessings of Allaah be upon him), then he believes in him and follows 
          him; he will have two rewards"" (The hadeeth was narrated 
          by Muslim, 219).
          On the basis of the above, the answer to your question is: yes, it is 
          very important, indeed essential, for you to take this step which will 
          change your life, bringing you a life of joy and tranquillity through 
          being close to Allaah and believing in His Oneness (Tawheed), having 
          the pleasure of worshipping and remembering Him, and earning reward 
          by obeying Him and saving these rewards for the Day when man will need 
          every single reward:""On the Day when every person will be confronted with all the 
          good he has done, and all the evil he has done, he will wish that there 
          were a great distance between him and his evil. And Allaah warns you 
          against Himself (His punishment) and Allaah is full of kindness to (His) 
          slaves"" [Aal 'Imraan 3:30 - interpretation of the meaning]
          With regard to your name, if it has no meanings that involve Shirk (associating 
          others with Allaah) or Kufr (disbelief), then it is permissible for 
          you to keep your name. The name Ismaa'eel (Ishmael) is very suitable; 
          how could it be otherwise when Ismaa'eel was a Prophet of Allaah of 
          whom Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):""And mention in the Book (the Qur'aan) Ismaa'eel (Ishmael). 
          Verily, he was true to what he promised, and he was a Messenger, (and) 
          a Prophet. And he used to enjoin on his family and his people As-Salaat 
          (the prayers) and the Zakaat, and his Lord was pleased with him"" 
          [Maryam 19:54-55]
          We ask Allaah to help us and you to do that which He loves and which 
          pleases Him, and to guide us to the Straight Path, for Allaah guides 
          whom He wills and He knows best those who are guided.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
6390,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6390,Praying in a room    in which there are images,Is it permissible to pray in a room in which there are images?,,,"Praise be to Allah.The most correct view is that it is not permissible to pray in a room in which images of animate beings are hanging, on the basis of several reports, including the following:
The hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or images.”
(Agreed upon).
The hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) returned from a journey and I had covered an alcove with a blanket on which there were images. When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw it, he tore it down and said, ‘The people who will be most severely punished on the Day of Resurrection will be those who imitate the creation of Allah.’”
(Agreed upon).
The hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Jibreel came to me and said: ‘I came to you yesterday and nothing prevented me from entering except that there was a statue by your door, and there was a curtain in your house with images on it, and there was a dog in the house. So tell someone to cut the head off the statue by your door, so it will look like a tree; tell someone to cut up the curtain and make it into floor-cushions that will be stepped on; and tell someone to put the dog outside.’” So the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did that.
(Narrated by Abu Dawood, al-Tirmidhi and Ahmad).
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) gave a brief answer to this question, when he was asked: is it permissible to pray in synagogues and churches where there are images, or not? Can we say that they are the houses of Allah, or not? He replied: they are not the houses of Allah, for the houses of Allah are the mosques. These (churches etc.) are houses in which people express their disbelief (kufr) in Allah. Even though Allah may be mentioned in them, the house is the same as its occupants, and their occupants are kuffaar, so they are the houses of worship of the kuffaar.
As regards praying in them, there are three scholarly views in the Madhhab of Ahmad and others: absolute prohibition, which is the view of Maalik; absolute permission, which is the view of some of the companions of Ahmad; and the third view, which is the correct view and was narrated from ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab and others, and from Ahmad and others. This view states that if there are images in the church, we should not pray there, because the angels do not enter a house in which there are images, and because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not enter the Ka’bah until the images inside it had been wiped out. Similarly, ‘Umar said: we do not enter their churches if there are images inside.
Churches are like mosques that are built over graves. In al-Saheehayn it says that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was told about a church in Ethiopia, and the adornments and images inside it. He said: “When a righteous man among them dies, they build a mosque (place of worship) over his grave and put those images there. They will be the most evil of people with Allah on the Day of Resurrection.” But the Sahaabah did pray in churches in which there were no images.

6398,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6398,She wants to marry a person she loves but her family are refusing to let her,"I have been talking to a guy that I have very stong feelings for, and now we are thinking of taking it to another level which is marriage.  THe only problem is that my parents dont agree.  They feel that he is not worth of me and they feel that he will not treat me right! They have no valid reason other than the fact that alot of times they see us arguing bas it's normal.  I really love this guy and I am scared that when he comes and ask's for me my parents wont agree.  What is the quaran's ruling on this?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    It is not permissible for a woman – whether she is a virgin 
    or previously married – to get married without the permission of her 
    guardian. This has been explained previously in a number of answers. Please 
    see Question No. 
    2127. 

    Secondly: 

    The family – customarily and usually – is able to know what 
    is best for their daughter and who is best suited to marry her, because 
    usually girls have little knowledge and experience of life and what is best 
    for them, and they may be deceived by some nice words, and be ruled by their 
    hearts rather than by their heads. 

    Hence a girl should not go against her family’s opinion, if 
    they are known for their religious-commitment and wisdom. But if a woman’s 
    guardians reject husbands for no valid reason, or if their criteria for 
    choosing a husband are not acceptable by the standards of sharee’ah – such 
    as if they prefer a rich evildoer over one who is religiously committed and 
    of good character – then it is permissible for the girl to refer the matter 
    to the qaadi (sharee’ah judge) to annul the guardianship of the one who is 
    not letting her get married, and pass that role to someone else. But this is 
    not applicable in this case, because what is stopping the family from 
    agreeing to this husband is what they think is in the best interests of 
    their daughter, and this has to do with the character and attitude of the 
    husband. 

    Thirdly: 

    The things that lead to love between a young man and a young 
    woman may be things that are not Islamically acceptable, such as mixing, 
    being alone together, speaking, exchanging pictures, and so on. If this is 
    the case then a woman should realize that she has done something haraam, and 
    this is not the standard by which the man’s love for her should be measured. 
    For usually at this stage the man shows his best side and makes his 
    behaviour look as good as possible, so he can win the girl’s heart and get 
    what he wants.  If what he wants is haraam, then she will be like a victim 
    for the wolf and will lose the most precious thing that she possesses after 
    her religion. If what he wants is permissible – namely marriage – then he 
    has gone about it in a way that is not permissible. Moreover, she may get a 
    shock when she sees his attitude and how he treats her after marriage. This 
    is the fate of many wives. 

    So the family has to make a good choice for their daughter. 
    They should find out more about the husband, and they should not judge a 
    person on the basis of heated discussion that may be justifiable. What 
    matters is the man’s attitude and religious commitment. The family should 
    also remember the words of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him): “We do not think there is anything better for two who love one 
    another than marriage.” (Narrated by Ibn Maajah, 1847; classed as saheeh by 
    al-Busayri and al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 624. 

    The girl has to obey her family, for they know best what is 
    in her best interests, and all they want is for her to be happy with a 
    husband who will respect her and give her her rights. 

    We also advise the sister who asked this question to look at 
    the answer to question no.
