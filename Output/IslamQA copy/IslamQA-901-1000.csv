This is the basic principle and we do not know of any evidence (daleel) to the contrary.
 Secondly, it was reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whatever intoxicates in large quantities, a small amount of it is haraam.” (Narrated by Ahmad in al-Musnad, 2/91, 167, 179; 3/343). If the vinegar would cause intoxication in large amounts, then a little of it is haraam, and it comes under the same ruling as wine. If a large amount of it does not cause intoxication, then there is no reason not to sell it, buy it or drink it.",Islam Q&A
924,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/924,Those whom Allaah will shade with His shade,"What i want to know is that: What kind of people will be included into the ""shade"" of the chair which Allah (s.w.t) will be sitting, when the sun is brought closer to the earth. I hope i am phrasing the question right.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Seven of those whom Allah will shade with His shade on the Day when there will be no shade except His were mentioned in the saheeh ahadith.
 It was reported from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:
 “There are seven whom Allah will shade with His shade on the day when there will be no shade except His: the just ruler; a young man who grows up worshipping his Lord; a man whose heart is attached to the mosque; two men who love one another for the sake of Allah and meet and part on that basis; a man who is called by a woman of rank and beauty and says ‘I fear Allah’; a man who gives in charity and conceals it to such an extent that his left hand does not know what his right hand gives; and a man who remembers Allah when he is alone, and his eyes fill up.” (Agreed upon, narrated by al-Bukhari, no. 620; Muslim, no. 1712; and others).
 This is one of the blessings that Allah bestows upon His believing slaves. On the great Day when mankind will be suffering distress and hardship,the sun will be brought near to mankind, until the distance between them is equal to the length of the stick used for applying kohl to the eyes [meel= may also mean a “mile”], and all the people will sweat according to their deeds, except for some of the believers, whom Allah will single out to shade them with His shade, and He will protect them from the sun and from sweating.
 ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Aamir said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say:
 “The sun will be brought near to the earth and the people will sweat. For some people, the sweat will come up to their heels; for some it will come halfway up their shins; for some it will come up to their knees; for some it will come up to their backsides; for some it will come up to their hips; for some it will come up to their shoulders; for some it will come up to their necks; for some it will come up to the middle of their mouths; and some of them will be comepletely covered with their sweat.” (Narrated by Imam Ahmad in his Musnad, no. 16798)
 There follows the commentary of Ibn Hajar (may Allah be pleased with him) on the hadith (about the shade of Allah):
 “with His shade”. The fact that the shade is connected to Allah is an expression of honour, for every shade belongs to Him. It was said that this refers to His honour and protection, just as it may be said (in Arabic) that a person is in the shade (or shadow) of the king. And it was said that it refers to the shadow of His Throne, which is more correct
 “the just ruler” means one who holds the position of khaleefah, and anyone else who is appointed to a position of authority over the Muslims’ affairs, and he fulfils his duties justly.
 The best definition of “just” is: one who obeys the commands of Allah and puts everything in its proper place without going to the extreme either of overdoing it or of negligence. The just ruler is mentioned first because his benefits are so far-reaching.
 “a young man”. Young men are mentioned in particular because they are more likely to feel desire because of their strong motives for following their desires. The fact that a young man adheres to worship despite that is indicative of the strength of his taqwaa (piety).
 “worshipping his Lord”. In the hadith of Salmaan it says that he “spent his youth and his energy in worshipping Allah.”
 “attached to the mosque”. The apparent meaning is attachment in the sense of hanging, as if his heart is likened to something that hangs in the mosque – like a lamp, for example – indicating that his heart is so strongly attached to the mosque that even when he leaves the mosque, his heart is still there. Or it could mean attachment in the sense of a deep love.
 “love one another” means, they shared a kind of love whereby each loved the other in a genuine sense, not just to show off.
 “and [they] meet and part on that basis” means, this is an ongoing love based on religion, which they do not cut off for any worldly reason, whether they meet in reality or not, until death comes between them.
 “a man who is called by a woman of rank and beauty”. The meaning of “of rank” is, of high birth or a high position; this may refer to lineage or to wealth. The woman is described as having all the qualities which people usually seek, power and wealth, along with beauty. It is very rare to find all three in a woman. The apparent meaning is that she called him to commit immoral actions.
 “and says ‘I fear Allah’”. The apparent meaning is that he says this out loud, either to rebuke her for her immoralityor to refuse her call. It may also be that he says it in his heart.
 “to such an extent that his left hand does not know what his right hand gives”. What is meant by this is that he conceals his charitable giving , and goes to such an extreme that his left hand, even though it is so close to his right hand and is always with it that even if we imagined that it could understand, it would not know what the right hand is doing because of this utter secrecy. This is a metaphor.
 “and a man who remembers Allah” – either in his heart, or by mentioning Him out loud.
 “when he is alone” – because this is furthest away from showing off. What is meant here is that there are no distractions, so he pays attention to nothing except Allah.
 “his eyes fill up (lit. flood)” means, they fill with tears; this is another metaphor.
 Although men are mentioned in this hadith, women are also included in what is described here. Although what is meant by a “just leader” is the position of imaam (khaleefah), women may also be included in this, if they have children and treat them justly. The idea of being attached to the mosque does not apply to women, because a woman’s prayer in her home is better than her prayer in the mosque. Apart from that, women have a share in all of these things; if a man may be called by a woman, then it can be imagined that a woman could be called by a handsome king, for example, and she refuses because she fears Allah, even though she may have motives to respond.
 Fath al-Baari, 620.
 There are others whom Allah will also shade with His shade – apart from the seven mentioned in the hadith quoted above – who are mentioned in other ahadith. Ibn Hajar listed them in Fath al-Baari (620) as follows:
 “Those who fight (for the sake of Allah); those who help the mujaahideen; those who defer payment of debt for debtors who are in difficulty, or let them off all or part of the debt; those who help people who are heavily in debt; those who help slaves who have drawn up contracts of manumission; those who have a good attitude; those who walk to the mosque; sincere and honest traders; those who take what is due to them and no more; those who spend for the sake of Allah; those who sponsor orphans.”

Ophthalmic contact lenses: those that are used to correct long- or short-sightedness etc. There is nothing wrong with using this kind of contact lens on the advice of a specialist eye-doctor.
Coloured cosmetic contact lenses: these come under the rulings on adornment. If a woman wears them for her husband, there is nothing wrong with it. If she is wearing them where others will see her too, then it should not cause any fitnah or temptation. There is also the condition that they should not cause any harm, and there should be no element of cheating or deceiving, such as a woman wearing them when she meets the man who is proposing marriage to her. Also, they should not be extravagantly expensive, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… and waste not by extravagance…” [Al-An'am 6:141]

930,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/930,The Man is Head of Household,IF THE MAN IS NOT THE MAIN SOURCE OF INCOME IS HE CONSIDERED AS THE HEAD OF THE HOUSEHOLD?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Qiwaamah (the role of being in charge or head of the household) is one of the things that Allaah has given to men, exclusive of women. What is meant by qiwaamah is that men are entrusted with the task of being responsible for women, to take care of them, to guide them in the best possible way, and to issue commands and prohibitions - just as a ruler takes care of the people under his control.
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""...but men have a degree (of responsibility) over them [women]..."" [al-Baqarah 2:228] and ""Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allaah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means..."" [al-Nisaa’ 4:34]
Ibn Katheer said: ""This means that men are in charge of women; they govern them and discipline them if they do wrong."" Al-‘Allaamah Shaykh al-Shanqeeti said: ""This indicates that men are better than women, because the masculine is honour and perfection, whereas the feminine naturally has something lacking physically. All people are agreed on this, because all peoples give women the best of adornments, which is only to make up for this natural lack...""
Rare cases among women are nothing to go by, because the exception does not change the rule.
Some of the reasons why men are given the role of qiwaamah include:
1. Men are more intelligent and have a better ability to distinguish right from wrong. Al-Qurtubi said: ""Men have the advantage of being more wise and more capable of management; for this reason they were given the right of qiwaamah."" 2. Men’s religion is more complete, because women menstruate and bleed after childbirth, and do not pray or fast at such times - unlike men. 3. Spending money in charity and on one’s family is a duty on men, but not on women.
Thus if a man refuses to spend on his wife, she has the right to seek an annulment of the marriage by going to a Qaadi (Sharee’ah judge).
In summary, qiwaamah is only for men, as is made clear in the Qur’aan. If a woman spends on her husband, herself and her children, this is an act of kindness on her part, as Allaah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): ""... but if they, of their own good pleasure, remit any part of it (the mahr) to you, take it, and enjoy it without fear of any harm (as Allaah has made it lawful)."" [al-Nisaa’ 4:4] Qiwaamah is for men in all cases: one can hardly imagine a man asking his wife for permission to go out, for example. And Allaah knows best.

934,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/934,Ruling on Electrically Shocking an Animal When Slaughtering,What is the ruling of the Ulama with chicken slaughtered by Muslims but were stunned (given mild electric shock to weaken the chicken) before slaughtering?,,,"Praise be to Allah.It is prohibited to stun the animals by stroking or using electricity for these kinds of stunning hurt the animal and the Prophet (Peace be upon Him) interdicts us from torturing or hurting animals and on the contrary ordered us to be kind and benevolent with them especially at slaughtering. Imam Ahmad narrated on the authority of Ibn Abbas that the Prophet (Peace be upon Him) passed by a group from Al-Ansar (the supporters) while they were aiming at a pigeon. The Prophet said: ""Don’t make an aim from an alive creature"".
Saeed Ibn-Gobair narrated that Ibn-Ommar had passed by some youth from Koraish while they were aiming at a bird and in return for their missed shoots they gave the owner of the bird the arrows. When the youth saw Ibn-Ommar, they ran away so Ibn-Ommar said: ""Who did that? Allah curses the one who did that. The prophet (Peace be upon Him) curses any one who takes an alive creature as an aim"".Narrated by Muslim # 3619
Imam Muslim narrated on the authority of Ibn-Gaber Ibn-Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with them, that the Prophet ""forbids us from leaving animals tied without food or drinks until death"" (No. 3620)
Also, Imam Muslim narrated that Shadad Ibn-Aws said: ""I have kept in heart two points from our Prophet (Peace be upon Him). Allah orders us to refine every thing we do. When killing enemies, kill properly, and when slaughtering animals slaughter properly. So the one in change of slaughtering must sharpen his blade to comfort his slaughtered animal.
There are many other evidences that prove the importance of being kind and benevolent with animals.
In short, it is unlawful to stun the animal before slaughtering because stunning hurts the animal and Allah forbids us from doing that except in necessary when the animal is out of control at slaughtering and it is difficult to catch it so it is then lawful to resort to partial stunning to control the animal and in turn it would be lawful to be eaten if it is slaughtered alive.
This stunning is permitted only if it doesn’t lead to death of the animal for if that happened it would be unlawful to be eaten as Allah the Almighty said in His Holy Book:
""Forbidden to you (for food) are: dead meat, blood, the flesh of swine, and that on which hath been invoked the name of other than Allah, that which hath been killed by strangling, or by a violent blow, or by a head long fall, or by being gored to death, that which hath been (partly) eaten by a wild animal, unless ye are able to slaughter it (in due from), that which is sacrificed on stone (altars); (forbidden) also is the division (of meat) by raffling with arrow: that is impiety.""

947,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/947,Greeting Non-Muslims on Their Festivals,Can a Muslim greet a non-Muslim on his festival holiday like Christmas or Thanksgiving?,"Greeting the non-Muslims on Christmas and other religious holidays like Thanksgiving is prohibited by consensus because it implies that one accepts or approves of their rituals of disbelief, even if one would not accept those things for oneself.",,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
Greeting the non-Muslims on Christmas and other religious holidays of theirs is prohibited by consensus.
Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Ahkam Ahl Adh-Dhimmah: 
""Congratulating the non-Muslims on the rituals that belong only to them is prohibited by consensus, as is congratulating them on their festivals and fasts by saying ‘A happy festival to you’ or ‘May you enjoy your festival ,’ and so on. If the one who says this has been saved from [falling into] disbelief, it is still forbidden. It is like congratulating someone for prostrating to the cross, or even worse than that. 
It is as great a sin as congratulating someone for drinking wine, or murdering someone, or having illicit sexual relations, and so on. Many of those who have no respect for their religion fall into this error; they do not realise the offensiveness of their actions. Whoever congratulates a person for his disobedience or Bbid`ah or disbelief exposes himself to the wrath and anger of Allah.""
Congratulating the non-Muslims on their religious festivals is prohibited to the extent described by Ibn Al-Qayyim  (may Allah have mercy on him) because it implies that one accepts or approves of their rituals of disbelief, even if one would not accept those things for oneself. But the Muslim should not accept the rituals of disbelief or congratulate anyone else for them, because Allah does not accept any of that at all, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):
""If you disbelieve, then verily, Allah is not in need of you, He likes not disbelief for His slaves. And if you are grateful (by being believers), He is pleased therewith for you. . ."" [Az-Zumar 39:7]
"". . . This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion . . ."" [Al-Ma’idah 5:3]
So congratulating them is forbidden, whether they are one’s colleagues at work or otherwise.
If they greet us on the occasion of their festivals, we should not respond, because these are not our festivals, and because they are not festivals which are acceptable to Allah. 
These festivals are innovations in their religions, and even those which may have been prescribed formerly have been abrogated by the religion of Islam, with which Allah sent Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to the whole of mankind. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
""Whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers."" [Al `Imran 3:85]
It is prohibited for a Muslim to accept invitations on such occasions, because this is worse than congratulating them as it implies taking part in their celebrations .
Similarly, Muslims are forbidden to imitate the non-Muslims by having parties on such occasions, or exchanging gifts , or giving out sweets or food, or taking time off work, etc. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""Whoever imitates a people is one of them.""
Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his book Iqtida’ As-Siraat Al-Mustaqim Mukhalifat ashab Al-jahim: 
""Imitating them in some of their festivals implies that one is pleased with their false beliefs and practices, and gives them the hope that they may have the opportunity to humiliate and mislead the weak [Muslims].""
Whoever does anything of this sort is a sinner, whether he does it out of politeness or to be friendly, or because he is too shy to refuse, or for whatever other reason, because this is hypocrisy in Islam, and because it makes the non-Muslims feel proud of their religion.
Allah is the One Whom we ask to make the Muslims feel proud of their religion, to help them adhere steadfastly to it, and to make them victorious over their enemies, for He is the Strong and Omnipotent.” (Majmu` Fatawa wa Rasa’il Ash-Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin, 3/369)

There are many non-Muslims such as Jews and Christians who love Allah, and similarly there are immoral Muslims who love Allah. They would never say that they hate their Lord. Can you clarify this matter?","Loving Allah alone is insufficient to earn Allah's reward and for salvation. Loving what Allah loves is a means to enter Islam and leave disbelief, and those most devoted to this love are most beloved to Allah. Love for the sake of Allah is essential and interconnected with loving what Allah loves. Loving that which Allah loves cannot be complete until one also loves for the sake of Allah.",,"Praise be to Allah.Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said regarding this matter:
“There are four kinds of love , which we must differentiate between, and those who go astray do so because they do not make this distinction. 

The first of them is loving of Allah, but this alone is not sufficient to save a person from the punishment of Allah or to earn His reward. The Mushrikun (polytheists), worshippers of the cross, Jews and others all love Allah. 
The second is loving that which Allah loves. This is what brings a person into Islam and out of disbelief. The most beloved of people to Allah are those who are most correct and most devoted in this kind of love. 
The third kind is loving for the sake of Allah , which is one of the essential components of loving that which Allah loves. Loving that which Allah loves cannot be complete until one also loves for the sake of Allah . 
The fourth is loving something alongside Allah, and this  is polytheistic love. Whoever loves something along with Allah, not for His sake or through His love or for it, has taken another as an equal with Him. This is the love of the polytheists. 

There remains a fifth kind of love which has nothing to do with our topic; this is the natural love which is a person’s inclination towards that which suits his nature, such as the love of a thirsty person for water or of a hungry person for food, or the love of sleep, or of one’s wife and children. There is nothing wrong with this unless it distracts a person from remembering Allah and keeps him from loving Him. Allah says (interpretation of the meanings):
“O you who believe! Let not your properties or your children divert you from the remembrance of Allah.” [Al-Munafiqun 63:9]
“Men whom neither trade nor sale (business) diverts from the remembrance of Allah.” [An-Nur 24:37]” (Al-Jawab al-Kafi, 1/134)
Ibn Al-Qayyim ( may Allah have mercy on him) also said :
“The difference between loving for the sake of Allah and loving something alongside Allah is one of the most important distinctions. Everyone needs to make this distinction and is indeed obliged to do so. Loving for the sake of Allah is a sign of the perfection of faith, but loving something alongside Allah is the essence of shirk (polytheism). 
The difference between them is that a person’s love for the sake of Allah is connected to his love of Allah; if this love becomes strong in his heart, this love dictates that he will love that which Allah loves. If he loves that which his Lord loves and he loves those who are the friends of Allah, this is love for the sake of Allah. So he loves His Messengers, Prophets, angels and close friends because Allah loves them, and he hates those who hate them because Allah hates those people. 
The sign of the love and hatred for the sake of Allah is that his hatred for the one whom Allah hates will not turn into love merely because that person treats him kindly, does him a service or meets some need he has; and his love for those whom Allah loves will not turn to hatred simply because that person does something that upsets or hurts him, whether it is done by mistake or deliberately, in obedience to Allah or because the person feels that he has a duty to do it for some reason, or because the person is a wrongdoer who may yet give up his wrongdoing and repent. 
The entire religion revolves around four principles: love and hatred, and stemming from them, action and abstinence. The person whose love and hatred, action and abstinence, are all for the sake of Allah, has perfected his faith so that when he loves, he loves for the sake of Allah, when he hates, he hates for the sake of Allah, when he does something, he does it for the sake of Allah, and when he abstains from something, he abstains for the sake of Allah. To the extent that he is lacking in these four categories, he is lacking in faith and commitment to religion. This is in contrast to the love of things alongside Allah, which is of two types. One is diametrically opposed to the principle of Tawhid (Oneness of Allah) and is shirk; the other is opposed to perfection of sincerity and love towards Allah, but does not put a person beyond the pale of Islam.

The first kind is like the love of the Mushrikun for their idols and gods. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):

“And of mankind are some who take (for worship) others besides Allah as rivals (to Allah). They love them as they love Allah.” [Al-Baqarah 2:165]
These Mushrikun love their idols and gods alongside Allah as they love Allah. This love and devotion is accompanied by fear, hope, worship and supplication. This love is pure Shirk which Allah does not forgive. Faith cannot be perfected unless a person regards these idols as enemies and hates them intensely, and hates the people who worship them, and regards them as enemies and strives against them. This is the message with which Allah sent all His messengers and revealed all His Books. He created Hell for the people of shirk who love these rivals, and He created Paradise for those who strive against them and take them as enemies for His sake and to earn His Pleasure. Anybody who worships anything from the vicinity of the Throne to the lowest depths of the earth and takes a god and a supporter besides Allah and associates other beings in worship with Him, will be disowned by the object of his worship when he is most in need of it [i.e., on the Day of Judgement].

The second kind is love for the things which Allah has made attractive to people, such as women, children, gold, silver, branded beautiful horses, cattle and well-tilled land. People love them with a kind of desire, like the love of the hungry person for food and the thirsty person for water. This love is of three kinds. If a person loves them for the sake of Allah and as a means of obeying Allah , he will be rewarded for that; it will be counted as a part of love for the sake of Allah and a means of reaching Him, and he will still find enjoyment in them. 

This is how the best of creation [i.e. the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)] was, to whom women and perfume were made dear in this world, and his love for them helped him to love Allah more and to convey His Message and fulfill His commands. 
If a person loves them because they suit his nature and his own desires, but he does not give them preference over that which Allah loves and is pleased with, and he gets them because of his natural inclination, then they come under the heading of things which are permissible, and he will not be punished for that, but his love of Allah and for the sake of Allah will be lacking somewhat. If his sole purpose in life is to get these things, and he gives priority to that over that which Allah loves and is pleased with, then he is wronging himself and following his own desires.
The first is the love of al-Sabiqun (those who are foremost in Islam); the second is the love of al-muqtasidun (those who are average) and the third is the love of al-zalimun (the wrongdoers).” (Al-Ruh by Ibn al-Qayyim, 1/254)

951,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/951,What Is ‘Aqeedah?,What is ‘Aqeedah? I kindly request you to explain this to me.,"‘Aqeedah refers to those matters which are believed in, with certainty and conviction, in one’s heart and soul. They are not tainted with any doubt or uncertainty.","What is ‘Aqeedah?


Principles of ‘Aqeedah","Praise be to Allah.What is ‘Aqeedah?
‘Aqeedah refers to those matters which are believed in, with certainty and conviction, in one’s heart and soul. They are not tainted with any doubt or uncertainty.
The Arabic word ‘aqeedah stems from the root ‘aqada, which conveys meanings of certainty, affirmation, confirmation, etc. In the Quran, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
""Allah will not punish you for what is unintentional in your oaths, but He will punish you for your deliberate oaths (bima ‘aqqadtum al-ayman)…"" [al-Maidah 5:89]
The verb paraphrased here as ""deliberate oaths"" is ‘aqqada/ta’qeed, which refers to when one has determination in the heart. It may be said in Arabic, ‘aqada’l-habl (the rope was tied), i.e., it was pulled tight together. 
The word i’tiqad (belief) is also derived from this root, and has the meaning of tying up and making strong. The phrase a’taqadtu kadhaa (I believe such and such) means: I am convinced of it in my heart; this is a rational conviction.
In Islam, ‘aqeedah is the matter of knowledge. The Muslim must believe in his heart and have faith and conviction, with no doubts or misgivings, because Allah has told him about ‘aqeedah in His Book and via His Revelations to His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).
Principles of ‘Aqeedah
The principles of ‘aqeedah are those which Allah has commanded us to believe in, as mentioned in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):
""The Messenger believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers. Each one believes in Allah, His Angels, His Books and His Messengers. They say, ‘We make no distinction between one and another of His Messengers’ – and they say, ‘We hear, and we obey. (We seek) Your forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the return (of all).’"" [al-Baqarah 2:285]
- and as defined by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the famous hadeeth which describes how Jibreel came to him and asked him about Islam etc.: ""Iman (faith) is to believe in Allah, His angels, His Books, the meeting with Him on the Last Day, His Messengers, and the Day of Resurrection.""
So in Islam, ‘aqeedah refers to the matters which are known from the Quran and sound ahadeeth, and which the Muslim must believe in his heart, in acknowledgement of the truth of Allaah and His Messenger.

permissible for one to think badly of the Prophet’s wife ‘Aa’ishah, when anything 
said about ‘Aa’ishah is from authentic hadeeeths, such as Saheeh al-Bukhaari and 
Saheeh Muslim?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
‘Aa’ishah and the other Mothers of the Believers are included among the Companions of the 
Prophet 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him), so every text that forbids slandering the Companions 
refers to ‘Aa’ishah too.
Abu Sa‘eed al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: ""The Messenger of Allah 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: ‘Do not slander my Companions, for if one of you were to spend an 
amount of gold equivalent to the size of Mount Uhud, you would not even come halfway up to 
their level."" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, no. 3379).
Moreover, the scholars of Sunni Islam are all agreed that whoever condemns ‘Aa’ishah for that 
of which Allaah has stated she is innocent is a kaafir, because he has rejected Allaah’s 
statement of her innocence in Soorat al-Noor.
Imaam Ibn Hazm quoted a report with an isnad going back to Hishaam ibn ‘Ammaar, who said: 
""I heard Maalik ibn Anas say: ‘Whoever curses Abu Bakr should be whipped, and whoever 
curses ‘Aa’ishah should be killed.’ He was asked, ‘Why do you say that concerning (the one 
who curses) ‘Aa’ishah?’ He said, ‘Because Allaah says concerning ‘Aa’ishah, may Allah be 
pleased with her (interpretation of the meaning): ""Allaah forbids you from it [slander] and 
warns you not to repeat the like of it forever, if you are believers."" [al-Noor 24:17]’""
Maalik said: ""Whoever accuses her goes against the Qur’aan, and whoever goes against the 
Qur’aan should be killed.""
Ibn Hazm said: ""This comment of Maalik’s is correct, and it is complete apostasy to reject 
Allaah’s words that clearly state her innocence.""
Abu Bakr ibn al-‘Arabi said: ""Because the people who slandered ‘Aa’ishah accused a pure and 
innocent person of immorality, then Allah exonerated her. So everyone who accuses her of that 
of which Allah has stated she is innocent is rejecting what Allah says, and everyone who rejects 
what Allah says is a kaafir. This is the opinion of Maalik, and the matter is very clear to those 
who have insight.""
Al-Qaadi Abu Ya‘laa said: ""Whoever slanders ‘Aa’ishah by accusing her of that of which Allah 
stated her innocence is a kaafir, without doubt. More than one imam stated this ijmaa‘ 
(consensus) and gave this ruling.""
Ibn Abi Moosaa said: ""Whoever accuses ‘Aa’ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, of that of 
which Allaah stated she was innocent has left the religion (is no longer a Muslim) and has no 
right to marry a Muslim woman."" 
Ibn Qudaamah said: ""It is a part of the Sunnah to say ‘May Allah be pleased with her’ after 
mentioning the wives of the Prophet 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him), Mothers of the Believers 
who are pure and innocent of any evil. The best of them are Khadeejah bint Khuwaylid and 
‘Aa’ishah al-Siddeeqah bint al-Siddeeq, whose innocence was stated by Allah; (they are) the 
wives of the Prophet 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) in this world and the next. Whoever accuses 
her of that of which Allah has stated her innocence has rejected the words of Allaah 
All-Mighty.""
Imam al-Nawawi, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: ""‘Aa’ishah’s innocence of that of which 
she was accused is stated definitively in the Qur’aan. If anyone doubts that (may Allah protect 
us from such a thing), he becomes a kaafir and an apostate, by the consensus of the Muslims.""
Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: ""The ummah is agreed that whoever 
slanders her is a kaafir.""
Al-Haafiz ibn Katheer said, in his Tafseer: "" The scholars, may Allah have mercy on them, all 
agreed that whoever accuses or slanders her after the revelation of this aayah is a kaafir, 
because he has rejected the Qur’aan.""
Badr al-Deen al-Zirkashi said: ""Whoever slanders her is a kaafir, because the Qur’aan clearly 
states her innocence.""
The scholars based their ruling on the one who slanders ‘Aa’ishah on the following evidence:
(1)	The evidence that is derived from the verses in Soorat al-Noor that clearly state her 
innocence. So whoever accuses her after Allah has declared her innocent is rejecting the words 
of Allah, which is kufr beyond any shadow of a doubt.
(2)	Slandering the family of the Prophet SAWS (peace be upon him) hurts and offends the 
Prophet himself, and there is no doubt that whatever hurts and offends the Prophet SAWS 
(peace be upon him) is kufr, by consensus (ijmaa‘). Evidence that the slander of his wife hurt 
and offended the Prophet 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) is seen in the hadeeth of the slander 
(al-ifk) reported by al-Bukhaari and Muslim, in which ‘Aa’ishah says: "". . . The Messenger of 
Allaah 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) stood up on that day and asked who would go and deal 
with ‘Abdullaah ibn Ubayy. He was on the minbar, and said: ‘O Muslims, who will deal with a 
man who I have heard is speaking in an offensive manner about my family? By Allaah, I know 
nothing but good about my family.’ . . ."" What the Prophet 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) meant 
was: who will be kind to me, and excuse me if I go and deal with him myself, and I give him 
what he deserves because I have heard that he is speaking in an offensive manner about my 
family. This proves that the Prophet 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) was so deeply offended and 
hurt that he asked people whether they could deal with this person fairly.
Imaam al-Qurtubi said, in his Tafseer of the aayah ""Allaah forbids you from it [slander] and 
warns you not to repeat the like of it forever, if you are believers."" [al-Noor 24:17]"":
""This is concerning ‘Aa’ishah . . . because of the hurt and offence that the Messenger of Allah 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) felt with regard to his honour and his family. This is kufr on the 
part of the one who does it."" 
(3)	Slandering ‘Aa’ishah implies insulting the Prophet 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him), because 
Allah, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning): ""Bad statements are for bad people (or bad women for bad men) and bad people for bad 
statements (or bad men for bad women). . . "" [al-Noor 24:26]
Al-Haafiz ibn Katheer, may Allah have mercy on him, said: ""I.e., Allah would not have made 
‘Aa’ishah the wife of the Messenger of Allah 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) if she had not been 
good, because he is better than any good person. If she had been bad, she would not have 
been fit to marry him from a shar‘i point of view, and Allah would never even have decreed it..""
Finally, let us remember that the most beloved of all people to him 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) 
was ‘Aa’ishah al-Siddeeqah bint al-Siddeeq, as is proven in the report of ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas, 
who said: ""The Messenger of Allaah 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) put me in charge of an army 
during the ghazwah (campaign) of al-Salaasil. I came to him and asked him, ‘O Messenger of 
Allaah, who among the people is most beloved to you?’ He said, ‘Aa’ishah.’ I asked, ‘Who 
among men?’ He said, ‘Her father.’ I asked, ‘Then who?’ He said, ‘‘Umar,’ then he mentioned 
a number of others."" 
So whoever feels hatred towards the beloved of the Messenger of Allaah 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) will deserved to be despised by him on the Day of Resurrection. And Allaah knows 
best.","See ‘Aqeedat Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa‘ah fi’l-Sahaabah al-Kiraam by Naasir al-Shaykh, 2/781, and I‘tiqaad Ahl al-Sunnah fi’l-Sahaabah by Muhammad al-Wahaybi, p. 58)"

It is permissible for a Muslim to donate blood to a non-Muslim, except when that non-Muslim 
is known to be in a position of fighting the Muslims (either by belonging to a state which is in a 
state of war with Muslims or by supporting aggression towards them). In such a case it is not 
permissible to donate blood, because this will help them to fight Muslims. If the Muslim has no 
way of knowing to whom his blood will go, he should act according to what he thinks is most

      friend became a Muslim a few months ago. He wants to go to Mecca (Makkah) to make a
      pilgrimage in the near future, but he has a big injury on his foot, and needs to use a
      crutch.
   Can he go to Makkah? Or can people who are not
      healthy not make the pilgrimage?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Allaah says in His Holy Book:
“. . . Hajj to the House [Ka‘bah] is a duty that mankind
    owes to Allaah, those who can afford the expenses (for one’s conveyance, provision
    and residence]; and whoever disbelieves, then Allaah stands not in need of any of the ‘Aalameen
    [mankind and jinn].” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:97]
The scholars’ discussion of the ability to perform Hajj revolves
    around the availability of a means of transport and sufficient money for the journey there
    and back, as well as sufficient funds to cover one’s family’s needs during
    one’s absence, freedom from debt, good health, security on the way, and - for women -
    a mahram (blood relative within the prohibited degrees of marriage, or a husband).
The issue of your Muslim friend revolves around the question of
    health, so we will focus on this matter here:
With regard to the interpretation of the aayah (verse of the
    Qur’aan) quoted above, ‘Ikrimah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “Sabeel
    [paraphrased in the phrase ‘those who can afford the expenses’] means
    health.” (Tafseer Ibn Katheer).
One of the conditions of Hajj being obligatory is that a person
    should be free of physical illness and disability that would prevent him from performing
    Hajj. If a person is suffering from a chronic illness, permanent disability, paralysis
    (that makes him unable to walk) or is very old and unable to move about, then there is no
    obligation to perform Hajj.
If a person is able to perform Hajj with the help of another, then it
    becomes a duty to perform Hajj when such help is available. (al-Mawsoo‘ah
    al-Fiqhiyyah, 17/34).
Ibn Katheer, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: “There may be
    different categories of ability. Sometimes a person may be able to perform Hajj by
    himself, and sometimes with the help of others, as is stated in the books of Ahkaam
    (Islamic rulings).” (Tafseer of the aayah previously quoted).
Whoever suffers from a permanent disability that prevents him from
    performing Hajj must appoint someone to perform Hajj on his behalf. If his disability is
    not permanent, then he should wait until he has recovered, then perform Hajj for himself;
    he is not permitted to appoint someone to perform Hajj on his behalf. 
This is the answer to your question, which I hope you will convey to
    your friend. I do not want to miss this opportunity to thank you for your concern and
    interest in finding out the Islamic rulings in this situation which has to do with the
    fifth pillar of Islam. I also wish to encourage and invite you to join us in Islam. Peace

is not a condition for Friday prayers being obligatory or valid, according to Ahl

Having dealt with what you have heard from people who have no knowledge, but who 
are unfortunately in the position of ""imaams,"" as you said, we move on to the basic 
issue of offering salaat al-dhuhr after salaat al-jumuah. Our answer to this question is 
that the truth is the opinion of the scholars, most of whom say that there is no basis in 
shareeah for offering dhuhr prayer after jumuah prayer if a person has prayed 
jumuah. The one who misses jumuah or does not attend it because it is not an 
obligation for him or her, such as women, sick people or travellers, must pray dhuhr. 
It was never reported that the Prophet

974,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/974,The kufr of one who rules according to other than    what Allaah revealed,Is ruling with rules other than sharee‘ah “kufr akbar” or “kufr asghar”?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Allaah has commanded us to refer matters to His judgement and to establish Sharee‘ah, and He has forbidden us to rule with anything else, as is clear from a number of aayaat in the Qur’aan, such as the aayaat in Soorat al-Maa’idah (5) which discuss ruling according to what Allaah has revealed, and mention the following topics:


The command to rule according to what Allaah has revealed: “And so judge between them by what Allaah has revealed . . .” [aayah 49]




Warning against ruling by other than what Allaah has revealed: “. . . and follow not their vain desires . . .” [aayah 49]




Warning against compromising on any detail of Sharee‘ah, no matter how small: “. . . but beware of them lest they turn you far away from some of that which Allaah has sent down to you . . .” [aayah 49]




Forbidding seeking the ruling of jaahiliyyah, as is expressed in the rhetorical question “Do they then seek the judgement of (the Days of) Ignorance?” [aayah 50]




The statement that nobody is better than Allaah to judge: “. . . and who is better in judgement than Allaah for a people who have firm Faith?” [aayah 50]




The statement that whoever does not judge according to what Allaah revealed is a kaafir, a zaalim (oppressor or wrongdoer) and a faasiq (sinner), as Allaah says: “. . . And whoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed, such are the kaafiroon.” [aayah 44]; “. . . And whoever does not judge by that which Allaah has revealed, such are the zaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers)” [aayah 45]; “. . . And whoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed (then) such (people) are the faasiqoon (rebellious or disobedient).” [aayah 47].




The statement that it is obligatory for the Muslims to judge according to what Allaah has revealed, even if those who seek their judgement are not Muslim, as Allaah says: “. . . And if you judge, judge with justice between them. . .” [aayah 42]


Judging or ruling according to other than what Allaah has revealed is contrary to faith and Tawheed, which are Allaah’s rights. It may be counted as kufr akbar (greater kufr) or kufr asghar (lesser kufr) according to circumstances. Kufr akbar will make a person no longer a Muslim in cases such as the following:






If he issues laws and regulations other than those revealed by Allaah, because the right to issue laws belongs to Allaah alone, Who has no partner, and whoever “competes” with Him in a matter which is His alone is a mushrik, because Allaah says: “Or have they partners with Allaah (false gods), who have instituted for them a religion which Allaah has not allowed?” [al-Shooraa 42:21]


If the one who rules by other than that which Allaah has revealed denies the right of Allaah and His Prophet to rule, as is mentioned in Ibn ‘Abbaas’s comment on the aayah:“. . . And whoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed, such are the kaafiroon.” [al-Maa’idah 5:44]. Ibn ‘Abbaas said: “Whoever rejects what Allaah has revealed is a kaafir.”


If he prefers the rule of falsehood to the rule of Allaah, whether this is in absolute terms or just in a few matters. Allaah says: “Do they then seek the judgement of (the Days of) Ignorance? And who is better in judgement than Allaah for a people who have firm Faith?” [al-Maa’idah 5:50]


If he regards the rule of Allaah and the rule of falsehood as equal. Allaah says: “. . . Then do not set up rivals unto Allaah (in worship) while you know (that He Alone has the right to be worshipped).” [al-Baqarah 2:22]


If he thinks that it is permissible to rule by something that contradicts the rule of Allaah and His Messenger, or he believes that it is not obligatory to rule according to what Allaah has revealed, or that the matter is optional. This is kufr which is contradictory to faith. Allaah revealed: “O Messenger! Let not those who hurry to fall into disbelief grieve you, of such who say: ‘We believe’ with their mouths but their hearts have no faith. And of the Jews are men who listen much and eagerly to lies - listen to others who have not come to you; they say, ‘If you are given this, take it, but if you are not given this, then beware!’ . . .” [al-Maa’idah 5:41]. He says: “Go to Muhammad (peace be upon him), and if he tells you that the ruling is lashes, accept it, but if he commands stoning, ignore what he says. Then Allaah revealed “. . . And whoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed, such are the kaafiroon (disbelievers)” [al-Maa’idah 5:44].


If he does not rule according to what Allah has revealed out of stubbornness and arrogance, he is a kaafir and has left Islaam, even if he does not deny the rule of Allaah. Stubbornness and arrogance may mean negligence and turning away, as Allaah says: “Have you seen those (hypocrites) who claim that they believe in that which has been sent down to you, and that which was sent down before you, and they wish to go for judgement (in their disputes) to the Taaghoot (false judges, etc.) while they have been ordered to reject them. But Shaytaan wishes to lead them astray. And when it is said to them: ‘Come to what Allaah has sent down and to the Messenger,’ see they hypocrites turn away from you (Muhammad) with aversion.” [al-Nisaa’ 4:60-61]


Among the things that may be counted as ruling by other than that which Allaah revealed and kufr akbar is what Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem said about man-made laws and ruling by them: “This is the worst, the most obvious and comprehensive opposition to sharee‘ah and rejection of Allaah’s laws. This is competing with Allaah and His Messenger, contradicting His laws in their preparation, support, structure, ruling and references.






The above is a summary of the things that may imply that ruling by other than that which Allah has revealed is a form of shirk akbar (major shirk):
(1) Ruling by other than that which Allaah has revealed.
(2) Denying the right of Allaah and His Messenger to rule.
(3) Preferring the rule of falsehood to the rule of Allaah, whether this is complete or only in a few matters.
(4) Regarding the rule of Allaah and the rule of falsehood as equal.
(5) Thinking that it is permissible to rule by something that contradicts what Allaah has revealed, or believing that ruling by what Allaah has revealed is not obligatory or is optional.
(6) Refusing to rule by what Allaah has revealed.
By examining this topic from different angles, it becomes clear that what is counted as kufr akbar is the following:






Abolishing sharee‘ah as the law governing a country, as Mustafa Kemal (“Ataturk”) did in Turkey, as he abolished the book Majallah al-Ahkaam al-‘Adliyyah which was based on the Hanafi madhhab, and replaced it with man-made laws.


Abolishing sharee‘ah courts.


Imposing man-made laws, such as Italian, French, German law, etc., to judge between the people, or mixing these laws and Sharee‘ah, as Genghis Khan did in his book al-Yaasiq, which combined laws from different sources; the ‘ulamaa’ (scholars) ruled that he was a kaafir.


Confining the role of sharee‘ah courts to so-called “civil” matters, such as marriage, divorce and inheritance.


Setting up non-sharee‘ah courts.


Discussing sharee‘ah in parliament and voting on it; this indicates that implementing sharee‘ah is conditional upon a majority vote.


Making sharee‘ah a secondary or main source, along with other sources of law. Even when they say that sharee‘ah is the primary source of legislation, this is still kufr akbar, because it means that they are allowing the adoption of laws from other sources too.


Stating in the clauses of legislation that reference may be made to international law, or stating in treaties that in the case of dispute, the matter may be referred to such-and-such non-Islamic court.


Criticizing sharee‘ah in public or in private, such as saying that it is rigid, incomplete or backward, or suggesting that it is incompatible with our times, or expressing admiration for non-Islamic laws.






As regards the question of when ruling by other than what Allaah revealed is kufr asghar, which does not exclude a person from the ummah of Islam:
the answer is that this may be the case when a ruler or judge passes judgement according to other than what Allaah revealed out of disobedience or on a whim, or as a favour to someone, or because he was bribed, and so on, although he believes that it is obligatory to judge according to what Allaah has revealed, and that what he has done is a sinful and haraam deed.
As regards the one who is governed by a non-Islamic law, if he refers to it out of choice, then he is a kaafir whose kufr akbar means that he has left Islaam. But if he has no choice but to refer to this law, and does so reluctantly, then he is not a kaafir, because if he had been able to resort to sharee‘ah, he would have done so, and he believes that this non-Islamic law is false.

Ghusl is recommended on the two ‘Eids, after washing a dead body; before entering ihram or entering Makkah; and for a woman who is suffering from istihadah.","When is ghusl required?


When is ghusl recommended?","Praise be to Allah.When is ghusl required?
The causes that make ghusl a must are:

The emission of semen, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""What requires water (ghusl ) is if you see water (i.e., semen) coming out of you."" (Muslim, no. 1/269)
Contact between the genitals , because the Prophet (peace and blessings of  Allah be upon him) said: ""If one part enters the other part (in another report: if one part touches the other part), then ghusl becomes obligatory."" (Ahmad and Muslim, no. 526) This ghusl is obligatory whether or not fluid (semen) is released. ""Touching"" here refers to the entry of the tip of the penis into the vagina, not mere touching.
Menstruation and nifas (post-natal bleeding), because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): "". . . And when they have purified themselves, then go in unto them as Allah has ordained for you. . ."" [al-Baqarah 2:222] The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to Fatimah bint Hubaysh, may Allah be pleased with her: ""When your period starts, stop praying, and when your period ends, perform ghusl then start praying again."" (Al-Bukhari, Fath, 309)
Death: the dead - apart from a martyr slain in battle - must be washed (ghusl), because when his daughter Zaynab died, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""Wash her with water three or five times, or as many times as you see fit."" (Al-Bukhari, al-Fath, 1175) When a man who was in a state of ihram was killed by his riding-beast, he said: ""Wash him with water and lote leaves and wrap him in his two garments, but do not embalm him or cover his head, for he will be raised on the Day of Resurrection pronouncing the Talbiyah."" (Al-Bukhari, Fath, 1186)

There are other types of ghusl about which the scholars differed as to whether they are obligatory, such as performing ghusl on Fridays, or whether a person who becomes Muslim needs to perform ghusl upon entering the Faith.
When is ghusl recommended?
There are types of ghusl which are encouraged, such as: ghusl on the two ‘Eids ; ghusl after washing a dead body; ghusl before entering the state of ihram or entering Makkah; ghusl for a woman who is suffering from istihadah (abnormal non-menstrual bleeding) before every prayer; ghusl after being unconscious; and ghusl after burying a mushrik.

I thought that what is najis is the nose (saliva) and that no other part of the dog is najis, except when it is wet. I also understood that keeping a dog as guard dog etc...is not haram. however, in Malaysia, there is a very strong aversion to the dog amongst Muslim communities to the extent that even in educational religious books produced from this country condemns the dog as najis (throughout) and haram to keep.
I hope you can clarify this.",,,"Praise be to Allah. 
The fuqahaa are agreed that it is not permitted to keep a dog unless it is for a purpose, like hunting or guarding property or other uses that are not contrary to the Shareeah. The Prophet (peace and blessing of Allaah be upon him) said: ""Whoever keeps a dog, except a dog for herding, hunting or farming, his reward will decrease by one qiraat every day."" (Reported by Muslim, 2948)
 
As far as keeping a dog to guard the house is concerned, Ibn Qudaamah said: ""It is not permitted, according to the most sound opinion."" (al-Mawsooah al-Fiqhiyyah, 35/124)
 
For more information on this matter, please see question #377 .
 
As regards the najaasah (impurity) of the dog, the Shaafii and Hanbali ulamaa say that the whole dog is essentially naajis (impure). Some scholars say that any liquid excreted by the dog is naajis (not the dog itself). The saliva of the dog is extremely naajis, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""If a dog licks the vessel of any one of you, let him throw away whatever was in it and wash it seven times."" (Reported by Muslim, no. 418).
 
Abu Hurayrah, may Allaah be pleased with him, reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""The way to purify the vessel of any one of you if a dog has licked it is to wash it seven times, the first time with earth."" (Reported by Muslim, no. 420).

Could you please provide me with some information about this subject, some ayaat from the Holy Quran or authentic ahaadeeth? With the term ""use of waseela"" I mean asking via the agency of someone, fx ""I ask You (O Allah) to grant me forgiveness via the agency of Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him and his household)"" or via the agency of other Prophets (Peace be upon them), saints or other pious Muslims.",,,"Praise be to Allah.What is meant by tawassul and waseelah is four things:


the kind of tawassul without which faith cannot be complete, which is seeking to reach Allah (tawassul) by believing in Him and His Messengers, and obeying Him and His Messenger, This is what is meant in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):


O you who believe! Do your duty to Allah and fear Him. Seek the means of approach to Him [Al-Maaidah 5:35]
This includes seeking to approach Allah through His Names and Attributes, or by doing acts of obedience and worship by which one seeks to approach Allah, and so on.
Seeking to approach Allah by asking His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to make dua for one during his lifetime, and the believers asking one another to make duaa for one another. This follows on from the first type and is encouraged.
Seeking to approach Allah by virtue of the status and virtues of some created being, such as saying, O Allah, I ask You by virtue of Your Prophet and so on. This is allowed by some of the ulama, but this opinion is daeef (weak). The correct view is that it is definitely haraam, because there can be no tawassul in duaa except by virtue of the Names and Attributes of Allah.
Tawassul as it is understood by many of the Muslims of later times, which is calling on the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and seeking his help (or seeking the help of the dead and so-called awliya). This is a form of major shirk, because calling on or seeking help from anyone other than Allah with regard to something that that only Allah is able to do is a kind of worship, and directing worship to anyone or anything other than Allah is major shirk.

983,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/983,Can Women Go to the Mosque?,"Here in my country (Surinam, South America), the Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jama‘ah forbid women to go to the mosque, saying that the first Imam (Imam Abu Hanifah) learned to do what pleases the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him), and he had said once that it is better for the women to perform prayer at home, because there is more reward in that, and as we come here to earn reward, it is better to do this.
Is it right to forbid women to go to the mosque? If so, where in the Holy Quran or the hadith can I find this?","Women's prayer at home is better than praying in the mosque, but this does not mean that women are not permitted to go to the mosque.","Is a woman's prayer at home better than praying in the mosque?


Can women go to mosques?


Conditions for the permission for women to go to mosques","Praise be to Allah.Is a woman's prayer at home better than praying in the mosque?
There is no doubt that a woman’s prayer in her house is better for her than praying in the mosque, as is indicated by the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). He said: ""Do not prevent your women from going to the mosque, even though their houses are better for them."" (Reported by Abu Dawud in al-Sunan, Bab ma ja-a fi khuruj al-nisa ila’l-masjid: Bab al-tashdid fi dhalik. See also Sahih al-Jami‘, no. 7458)

Whenever a woman prays in a place that is more private and more hidden, that is better for her, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""A woman’s prayer in her house is better than her prayer in her courtyard, and her prayer in her bedroom is better than her prayer in her house."" (Reported by Abu Dawud in al-Sunan, Bab ma ja-a fi khuruj al-nisa ila’l-masjid. See also Sahh al-Jami‘, no. 3833).

Umm Humayd, the wife of Abu Humayd al-Sa‘idi reported that she came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: ""O Messenger of Allah, I love to pray with you."" He said: ""I know that you love to pray with me, but praying in your house is better for you than praying in your courtyard, and praying in your courtyard is better for you than praying in the mosque of your people, and praying in the mosque of your people is better for you than praying in my mosque."" So she ordered that a prayer-place be built for her in the furthest and darkest part of her house, and she always prayed there until she met Allah (i.e., until she died). (Reported by Imam Ahmad; the men of its isnad are trustworthy)
Can women go to mosques?
But the fact that praying at home is preferable does not mean that that women are not permitted to go to the mosque, as is clear from the following hadith:
From ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar, who said: ""I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) say: ‘Do not prevent your women from going to the mosque if they ask your permission.’"" Bilal ibn ‘Abdullah said, ""By Allah, we will prevent them."" (Ibn ‘Umar) turned to him and told him off in an unprecedented fashion, saying: ""I tell you what the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon Him) said, and you say ‘By Allah, we will prevent them’!!"" (Reported by Muslim, 667)
Conditions for the permission for women to go to mosques
But there are conditions attached to the permission for women to go to the mosque , as follows:

She should wear complete hijab .
She should not go out wearing perfume .
She should have the permission of her husband.

Her going out should not involve any other kind of prohibited acts, such as being alone in a car with a non-mahram driver. If a woman does something wrong like that, her husband or guardian has the right to stop her; in fact it is his duty to do so.

984,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/984,Translating the Friday Khutbah,Is it permissible to hold the Jummah Khutbah in English if the majority of the community does not understand Arabic? Have the scholars agreed on this issue or is there a difference of opinions?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Some of the scholars said 
          that it is not permitted to translate the khutbah given from the minbar 
          on Friday and the two Eids into foreign (non-Arabic) languages. Their 
          intention (may Allaah have mercy on them) was to maintain and preserve 
          the Arabic language, and to follow the way of the Messenger 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his companions (may 
          Allaah be pleased with them), which was to give the khutbah in Arabic 
          in the lands of the Persians and others, and to encourage the people 
          to learn Arabic and pay attention to it.  
Other scholars said that 
          it is permissible to translate khutbahs into other languages if most 
          of the people being addressed do not know Arabic, based on the reason 
          for which Allaah enjoined the khutbah, which is to teach the people 
          about the rulings that Allaah has prescribed for them and to tell them 
          of the sins which are forbidden, to guide them towards good characteristics 
          and to warn them against bad characteristics. Undoubtedly paying attention 
          to the aims and purposes is more important and takes precedence over 
          paying attention to the words used, especially when the audience does 
          not understand Arabic and the khutbah does not have any effect on them 
          and does not motivate them to learn Arabic. (Especially in these times 
          when the Muslims have fallen behind and others have advanced, and the 
          language of the dominant people has become widespread and the language 
          of the defeated is in a weaker position).  
If 
          the aim of conveying knowledge and Islamic teaching to the people can 
          only be achieved among non-Arabs by translating the khutbahs into their 
          languages, then the view that it is permissible to translate the khutbah 
          into the prevalent language of the audience so that they may understand 
          what is being said takes precedence and should be followed, especially 
          if not translating the khutbahs will lead to conflicts and arguments. 
          Undoubtedly translating the khutbah in such a case becomes essential 
          to serve the people’s interests and avoid mischief.
 If 
          there are some people in the congregation who do understand Arabic, 
          then the khateeb should combine the two languages, giving the khutbah 
          in Arabic then repeating it in the other language which the other people 
          understand. In this manner he will achieve the two purposes, avoiding 
          mischief and conflict among the people whom he is addressing.
 There 
          is a great deal of evidence to support that in the pure sharee’ah, such 
          as the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):
“And 
          We sent not a Messenger except with the language of his people, in order 
          that he might make (the Message) clear for them.” 
[Ibraaheem 
          14:4] 
         And 
          the Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded Zayd ibn Thaabit 
          to learn the language of the Jews so that he might send letters to them 
          in their language and establish proof against them, and so that he might 
          read their letters when they were sent, and explain to the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) what they said. And when 
          the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) attacked the Romans and 
          Persians, they did not fight them until they had called them to Islam 
          by means of interpreters. When they conquered the foreign countries 
          they called the people to Allaah in Arabic and commanded the people 
          to learn it. Whoever among them did not know Arabic, they called him 
          in his own language and made him understand what was meant in the language 
          that he did understand. Thus proof was established. Undoubtedly this 
          is the only way, especially at the end of time when Islam is like a 
          stranger and every people is clinging to its own language. There is 
          a very real need for translation now, and the daa’iyah cannot convey 
          his message without it.
       

The khateeb should do that which best suits the interests of the people 
          he is addressing. If the best is to give the khutbah part by part, in 
          Arabic and then translated, then he should do that. If the best is to 
          translate the entire khutbah, after giving the khutbah (in Arabic) or 
          after the prayer, then he should do that. And Allaah knows best.","Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 8/251-255"

     thank you",,,"Praise be to Allah.Before we find out what the Quraan says about despising 
  others because of their origins, we should know what the Quraan says about 
  having girlfriends. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
 Wed them with the permission of their own folk and 
  give them their mahr (dowry) according to what is reasonable; they should be 
  chaste, not adulterous, nor taking boyfriends [al-Nisaa 4:25]
In his commentary on this aayah, Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have 
  mercy on him) said: 
Muhsanaat [translated as chaste] means 
  that they should be pure, not indulging in zinaa (unlawful sexual conduct), 
  hence they are described as not being musaafihaat, which means promiscuous 
  women who do not refuse anyone who wants to commit immoral acts with them 
  Ibn Abbaas said: muttakhidhaati akhdaan means lovers. 
   Al-Hasan al-Basri said: It means a (male) friend.  
  Allaah has also forbidden this, meaning marrying her so long as she is in that 
  situation
Now that you know the Islamic ruling on this matter and are sure 
  that what you have done is haraam and sinful, we will now move on to what Allaah 
  says about despising others for their origins. Allaah says (interpretation of 
  the meaning):
O you who believe! Let not a group scoff at another group, 
  it may be that the latter are better than the former; nor let (some) women scoff 
  at other women, it may be that the latter are better than the former 
  [al-Hujuraat 49:11]
Allaah has not created mankind in nations and tribes so that they 
  may be proud and despise one another, but so that they may be distinguished 
  from one another and thus get to know one another. Allaah says (interpretation 
  of the meaning):
O mankind! We have created you from a male and a female, 
  and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another. Verily, 
  the most honourable of you with Allaah is that (believer) who has taqwa (i.e. 
  is one of the muttaqeen  the pious). Verily Allaah is All-Knowing, All-Aware. 
  [al-Hujuraat 49:13]
Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, in his commentary 
  on this aayah:
Here Allaah is telling mankind that He created them from 
  one soul, from which He created its mate  this refers to Aadam and Hawwa 
  (Adam and Eve)  and made them into nations, which are bigger than tribes. 
  Beyond the tribe there are other smaller units and divisions, such as families 
  and clans. An alternative interpretation is that nations refers 
  to the non-Arabs and tribes refers to the Arabs. All people are 
  equal with regard to lineage because of their descent from Aadam and Hawwa, 
  upon whom be peace, but some may be better than others in religious matters, 
  i.e., in obedience to Allaah and in following His Messenger  
  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). For this reason, after forbidding 
  envy and scornful attitudes towards others, Allaah pointed out their equality 
  as human beings: O mankind! We have created you from a male and a female, 
  and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another  
  i.e., that they may know one another by referring to their tribes. Mujaahid 
  said that this meant by calling a person So-and-so the son of So-and-so, 
  from such-and-such a tribe.  Abu Hurayrah reported that the Messenger 
  of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
  him) was asked, Which people are the most honourable? He said: The 
  most honourable in the sight of Allaah are the most pious (those who have most 
  taqwa). They said, That is not what we were asking about. 
  He said: The most honourable of people is Yoosuf the Prophet of Allaah, 
  the son of the Prophet of Allaah, the son of the Prophet of Allaah, the son 
  of the Friend (khaleel) of Allaah. They said: That is not 
  what we were asking about. He said, Are you asking about which lineage 
  of the Arabs is most honourable? They said, Yes. He said: 
  The best of you at the time of Jaahiliyyah are the best of you in Islam, 
  if they understand properly. Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased 
  with him) also reported that the Messenger of Allaah  
  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Allaah does not look 
  at your outward appearance or your wealth, He looks at your hearts and your 
  deeds.

Evidence from the Quran that Allah is above His creation
The Quran describes the ""exaltedness"" or ""highness"" of Allah in different ways, as His being high and above, and by describing how things come down from Him, and go up to Him, and by stating that He is above heaven . For example (interpretations of the meaning):

(Highness):
	""… and He is the Most High, the Most Great."" [2:255]
	""Glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most High."" [87:1]
(Above):
	""And He is the Irresistible, above His slaves …"" [6:18]
	""They fear their Lord above them, and they do what they are commanded."" [16:50]
(Things coming down from Him):
	""He arranges (every) affair from the heavens to the earth … "" [32:5]
	""Verily We: it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e., the Quran) …"" [15:9]
(Things going up to Him):
	""… To Him ascend (all) the goodly words, and the righteous deeds exalt it …"" [35:10]
	""The angels and the Ruh (Jibril) ascend to Him …"" [70:4]
(Allah is above heaven):
	""Do you feel secure that He, Who is over the heaven, will not cause the earth to sink with you …?"" [67:16]

Evidence form the Sunnah that Allah is above His creation
Many reports were narrated ""Mutawatir"" (i.e. with a large number of narrators at every stage of the isnad/chain, such that it is impossible for them all to have agreed on a lie) from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), describing his words and deeds and things of which he approved. 

For example, he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say ""Subhana Rabbi Al-A`la (Glory be to my Lord Most High)"" in Sujud (prostration), and in some Hadiths (reports) he is reported to have said ""By Allah Who is above the Throne.""
Among his deeds is the gesture of pointing up with his finger, when addressing the people in the greatest gathering, on the Day of `Arafah during his Farewell Pilgrimage. He asked the people, ""Have I not conveyed the message?"" and they said, ""Yes!"" He asked again, ""Have I not conveyed the message?"" and they said, ""Yes!"" He asked a third time, “Have I not conveyed the message?"" and they said ""Yes!"" Each time, he said: ""O Allah, bear witness!"" - pointing up to the sky and then at the people. He also used to raise his hands towards heaven when he made Du`a (supplication), as reported in many Hadiths. This is proof via his actions that Allah is exalted and high.
An example of an approval of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) which indicates that Allah is Exalted and High is the Hadith (report) concerning the young slave girl, to whom the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""Where is Allah?"" She said: ""In heaven (menaing above heaven, as explained in the answer to question #124469)."" He asked, ""Who am I?"" She said, ""The Messenger of Allah."" So he said to her master: ""Set her free, for she is a believer.""
	This young girl was uneducated, as many are, and she was a slave, but she knew that her Lord is above heaven . Some misguided people deny that Allah is above heaven , and say, ""He is neither above nor below; neither to the right nor to the left. He is everywhere!""

The consensus of the scholars that Allah is above His creation
The Salaf (pious predecessors) agreed that Allah is above heaven, as is reported by scholars such as Adh-Dhahabi, may Allah have mercy on him, in his book Al-`Aluw lil `Ali Al-Ghaffar.
Evidence form common sense that Allah is above His creation
Highness is a quality which is associated in people’s minds with perfection. If this is the case, then it should be attributed to Allah because every absolute perfection should be attributed to Him.
Evidence form the innate instinct of man that Allah is above His creation
There should be no dispute that man instinctively knows that Allah is above heaven. Whenever something overwhelming befalls a person, and he turns to Allah for help, he looks towards heaven, not in any other direction. But it is strange that those who deny that Allah is above His creation still raise their hands in supplication to no other direction than towards heaven.
Even Pharaoh, the enemy of Allah who disputed with Musa (peace be upon him) about his Lord, told his minister Haman (interpretation of the meaning):
""O Haman! Build me a tower that I may arrive at the ways, - the ways of the heavens, and I may look upon the god of Musa …"" [40:36-37]
He knew in his heart of hearts that Allah is real, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): ""And they belied them (those ayat/signs) wrongfully and arrogantly, though their own selves were convinced thereof …"" [27:14]
These are a few of the indications that Allah is above the heavens; this proof comes from the Quran, the Sunnah, the consensus of the scholars, common sense, man’s own instincts and even the words of the non-Muslims.

996,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/996,Wudu is a prerequisite for wiping on socks,"Is it permissible to do masah(wiping) on the socks even if one did not have wudu prior to putting on his socks. Example: It is hard to wash ones feet at their business, because people think we are making a mess.",,,"Praise be to Allah.First: A Muslim must be proud of his religion and not feel ashamed of its rites and rituals being performed in front of others, or of what shari’ah imposes upon him. If he fears that seeing the implementation of a religious practice or ruling may cause the unbelievers to have an aversion to the religion, then he wisely conceals, aiming at presenting Islam gradually and in an appropriate way. This doesn’t mean to be ashamed or weak or feeling disgrace from implementation of some religious rituals.
I suspect you fear from their disapproval because of their misunderstanding, inverted senses, and spoiled opinions, ideas, and inclinations. How could the removal of one’s socks and the washing of one’s feet be considered filthy or disgusting, when the fact that is that it effects cleanliness and the removal of sweat and unpleasant odor from the feet?
Second: It is not permissible for the person to pass wet hands over the socks unless he put them on in a state of purity. You can find the evidence in the following Hadith narrated by Al-Mughirah Ibn-Shu’bah, may Allah be pleased with him, in which he said:
""I was traveling with our Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the Prophet asked me saying, ""Have you got any water?"" I said, ""Yes"" … and poured out water so that the Prophet washed his face and hands... and his arms then wiped his head. Then I bent over to pull off his khuff (a type of thick sock) but the Prophet said ""Leave them for I put on my khuff in a state of purification"" then he wiped over them. (narrated by Al-Bukhari, Fath ul-Baari No. # 5353)
Ibn Hajar, may Allah bless him, quoted the following in his explanation of the portion of this Hadith in which the Prophet’s said ""I put them on a state of purification"":
Al-Hamidy related in his Musnad that the Prophet was asked whether one could pass wet hands over the khuff, the Prophet answered saying: ""Yes if the person puts them on in a state of purification.""
Ibn Khuzayma said that according to Hadith narrated by Safwan Ibn Assal, ""the Prophet ordered us to wipe over khuff if we put them on in a state of purification, for 3 days during traveling and for one day and night in residency"".
Safwan’s hadith, although it is sahih, does not meet the conditions defined by Al-Bukhari. But al-Mughirah’s hadith is in agreement with it in its indication of the stipulation of being in a pure state before putting on the socks.
Third: It is in fact easy to solve your problem; all you need to do is perform the complete ablution at home before going to work, washing your feet, then put on your socks. Then, if you want to perform ablution again at work, you can pass your wet fingertips over the back (i.e., top) of each foot.
