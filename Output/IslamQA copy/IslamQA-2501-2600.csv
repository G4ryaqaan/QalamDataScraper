2506,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2506,"Are the
isti’aadhah and basmalah part of the opening du’aa’ of the prayer?","Is the ta'wuth and basmalah (seeking refuge
      in the name of Allah from the Shaitan and saying bismillah), are they part of the opening
      du'a? So If someone is praying behind the Imam should he say them quietly? Should he
      repeat the Bismillah in every raka'ah quietly if he is praying behind the Imam?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The istiaadaha and basmalah are not part of the opening
    duaa reported from the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
    him), although they are part of what should be recited at the beginning of the prayer.
    Aaishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allaah
    
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to open his prayer with takbeer
    (Allaahu akbar). (Reported by Muslim, no. 498)
    As regards saying the istiaadhah and basmalah in
    the second rakah, the scholars differ on this matter. The basmalah should be recited
    in every rakah, when reciting al-Faatihah, but it should not be recited
    aloud, because there is some dispute as to whether it is part of al-Faatihah or not. Those
    scholars who say that it is not part of al-Faatihah recommend that it should be recited
    before al-Faatihah in each rakah.
So to be on the safe side, the worshipper should recite the basmalah,
    silently, in every rakah.
With regard to the istiaadhah, there is no difference among the
    scholars, all of whom say that it is not part of Soorat al-Faatihah, but there is some
    discussion among them concerning the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): So
    when you want to recite the Quran, seek refuge with Allaah [al-Nahl
    16:98]
Those who take the aayah at face value say that the istiaadhah
    should be recited in every rakah, before reciting al-Faatihah and the basmalah. This
    is the opinion of the Shaafais and is the most correct opinion in their view. (Al-Majmoo,
    3/323). Al-Hasan al-Basri, Ataa and Ibraaheem al-Nakhai
    also recommended taawwudh in every rakah.
    Ibn Hazm (may Allaah have mercy on him) favoured this opinion, and it
    was also reported that Imaam Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhaab (may Allaah have mercy on
    him) mentioned it in Aadaab al-Mashiy ilal-Salaah. This opinion was also
    favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) (al-Insaaf
    2/74), who said in al-Ikhtiyaaraat: Taawwudh is
    recommended at the beginning of every recitation. (p.50). This is also the opinion
    of al-Allaamah al-Albaani.
    Some scholars say that it is to be recited at the beginning of the
    first rakah only, and does not have to be repeated in the other rakahs. This
    is the opinion of the Hanbalis (al-Insaaf, 2/73).
    Al-Shawkaani thought that the correct opinion was to recite it in the first rakah
    only. (Nayl al-Awtaar, 3/39, 139-140).
    The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to
    seek refuge with Allaah when he prayed. He used to say Aoodhu Billaahi min
    al-shaytaan il-rajeem min hamzihi wa nafkhihi wa nafathih (I seek refuge with Allaah
    from the accursed Shaytaan, from his evil insinuations). (reported by Abu
    Dawood). Sometimes he would expand on this and say, Aoodhu
    Billaahi il-Samee il-Aleem min al-shaytaan il-rajeem min hamzihi wa
    nafkhihi wa nafathih (I seek refuge with Allaah, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing, from
    the accursed Shaytaan, from his evil insinuations). (Reported by Abu Dawood
    and al-Tirmidhi). And Allaah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

      tawba(repentance) and maghfira(forgiveness)",,,"Praise be to Allah.Istighfaar (seeking forgiveness) is of two types,
    depending on whether the word is used alone or is accompanied by the word tawbah
    (forgiveness). When it is mentioned alone, it essentially means the same as tawbah.
    The two words are interchangeable, each carrying the meaning of the other, when mentioned
    separately.
    When the two words are used together, istighfaar means seeking
    protection from the evil of what is past, and tawbah means returning to Allaah and
    seeking protection from the evil of one’s own bad deeds which one fears may lie ahead
    in the future.
Istighfaar and tawbah are among the pairs of words which
    the scholars say convey one another’s meanings when used alone, but which have their
    own separate meanings when they are used together. And Allaah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

Other du`as which are sunnah to say in sujud may also be recited.
There is no specific mention of how the tasbih should be said in Sujud As-Sahw . The author of Al-Sunan wal-Mubtada’at said: 
“There is no report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said any specific words in Sujud As-Sahw ; the adkhar to mentioned in Sujud As-Sahw are the same as those to be recited in the sujud of prayer. 
As regards the belief that one should say Subhan man la yas-hu wa la yanam (Glory be to the One Who does not forget or sleep), neither the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) nor the Sahabah did this, and there is no evidence for it in the Sunnah. (Pp. 74-75)

2514,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2514,Muslimwoman’s hijab in front of non-Muslim women,"What is the role of Islam regarding hejab muslim women infront of non muslim women ,and is it allowed for non muslim women to cut muslim women's hair?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Allah says about the Muslim womans hijaab (interpretation of the meaning): and not to reveal their adornment except to their husbands, their fathers, their husbands fathers, their sons, their husbands sons, their brothers or their brothers sons, or their sisters sons, or their women [al-Noor 24:31]
The scholars differ as to whether kaafir women are included in the phrase or their women. The aayah gives Muslim women permission to remove their hijaab in front of their women. Some scholars say that the pronoun hinna (their) is referring to specific people, otherwise there would be no need to be so specific. Al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said, Or their women means the Muslim women it excludes the mushrik women whether they are of ahl al-dhimmah (non-Muslims living peacefully under Islamic rule) or others. It is not permitted for a believing woman to uncover any of her body in front of a mushrik woman unless she is a slave belonging to her.
(Al-Jaami li Ahkaam al-Quran, 12/233). Ibn Katheer said something similar in his Tafseer.
This is the opinion of the Hanafis, Maalikis and Shaafais, and is one of two opinions narrated from Imaam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him. Some of the scholars thought that the pronoun in the phrase or their women did not mean that Muslim women should take off their hijaab in front of Muslim women but not mushrik and kaafir women. This is the correct view of the Hanbalis. They said: The phrase or their women applies to all women, and the pronoun hinna was added because of the context and pattern of the passage, which mentions their fathers, their sons, etc. So the pronoun is added to make this word match the others.
The majority of scholars say that it is forbidden for a kaafir woman to look at a Muslim woman without hijaab, and this is the most correct interpretation of the aayah. If all women were meant, the aayah would have read or the women (in general), but what it actually says is or their women. There is no word or phrase in the Quran that does not carry a specific meaning, and there is no evidence to support the idea that the pronoun is only there to make the word match the pattern of the rest of the passage.

2521,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2521,Is It Haram to Be Vegan?,"I'm vegan, I mean I do not eat any meat product or dairy from milk, eggs, cheese, or honey, any thing that have to do with animal I just I don't eat it, and the thing is that I like the religion ofnIslam and I would like to be a part of it. So my question is: can I be a Muslim and still don't eat meat and animal products? Thank you so much.",It is not haram to be vegan by not eating animal products as long as you do not think that these things are haram or that it is better to abstain from these foods.,,"Praise be to Allah.Yes, you can be a Muslim without eating these animal products, but you need to be aware of the following:

You should not think that these things are haram (forbidden), because Allah says (interpretation of the meanings):

“O you who believe! Make not unlawful the tayyibat (all that is good as regards foods, things, deeds, beliefs, persons, etc.) which Allah has made lawful to you, and transgress not. Verily, Allah does not like the transgressors.” [Al-Maidah 5:87]
“Say: who has forbidden the adornment with clothes given by Allah, which He has produced for His slaves, and al-tayyibat [all kinds of lawful things] of food? Say: they are, in the life of this world, for those who believe, (and) exclusively for them (believers) on the Day of Resurrection (the disbelievers will not share them). Thus We explain the ayat (Islamic laws) in detail for people who have knowledge.” [Al-A’araf 7:32]
“Say: Tell me, what provision has Allah sent down to you! And you have made of it lawful and unlawful. Say: Has Allah permitted you (to do so), or do you invent a lie against Allah?” [Yunus 10:59]

You should not think that it is better to abstain from these foods, or that doing so will be rewarded, or that a vegetarian/vegan is closer to Allah than others, and so on. It is not permitted to draw closer to Allah in this way. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who is the best of mankind and the closest to Allah, used to eat meat and drink milk and honey. When one of his Companions wanted to give up meat, he told him that this was wrong. Anas reported that there was a group of the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), one of whom said, I will never marry women; another said, I will not eat meat; another said, I will not sleep on a bed; and another said, I will fast and never break my fast. News of this reached the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). He praised and thanked Allah, then said: What is wrong with the people who are saying such and such? I pray and I sleep; I fast and I break my fast; and I marry women. Whoever deviates from my Sunnah (way) does not belong to me. (Reported by al-Nasai; the story is also to be found in the two Sahihs of al-Bukhari and Muslim).

There is a great difference between not eating a certain kind of food because one does not like it, or it does not agree with one, or one has been put off for example by seeing an animal slaughtered when one was a child, which may leave one with a distaste for meat and other similar reasons, and thinking that meat is haram and that abstaining from it is an act of worship, as is done by Brahmins, monks and others who are misguided.
Once this matter is clear in your mind, there is nothing wrong with not eating foods that you do not like. We will be happy to welcome you soon as our sister in Islam. We ask Allah to give you the strength to do good and to protect you from every evil. Allah is the One Who guides to the Straight Path.

Does touching and kisssing are included when you refer to chastidy? What should be the advice given to a muslim boy that thinks touching is necessary before marriage?
I appreciate this to be confidencial. Thanks so much for helping me.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Abu Ja’far Muhammad ibn Jareer al-Tabari gave a definition of muhsanah in Jaami’ al-Bayaan ‘an Ta’weel Aayi’l-Qur’aan (8/165):
“Muhsanah means the woman who is chaste and pure … one who is chaste and protects her private parts from committing immoral acts, as in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): ‘And Maryam, the daughter of ‘Imraan, who guarded her chastity…’ [al-Tahreem 66:12], meaning that she kept herself above suspicious actions and protected herself from immoral conduct.”
Then he discussed the interpretation of the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): ‘… (lawful to you in marriage) are chaste women from the believers and chaste women from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before your time…’ [al-Maa’idah 5:5]
He said that some others said that what was meant by this aayah (‘… (lawful to you in marriage) are chaste women from the believers and chaste women from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before your time…’) is chaste women from both groups, whether they were slaves or free. Those who were of this opinion considered it permissible to marry slave women who were Jews or Christians who practised their religions, because of this aayah, but they considered it haraam to marry promiscuous women, whether they were Muslims or from the People of the Book. Then he mentioned reports to support this opinion.
He also said: ‘There was some dispute among the scholars about the interpretation of the phrase and chaste women from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before your time…- was this general or specific in application? Some said that it is general and applies to all chaste women, because muhsanaat means chaste women, and a Muslim is allowed to marry any woman of the People of the Book, free or slave, from a country whose people are engaged in hostilities with Islam or from a community which is living under Islamic rule. They use as evidence for this the apparent meaning of the phrase and chaste women from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before your time… - taking muhsanaat to mean any chaste woman, whoever she may be. This is the opinion of those who take muhsanaat to mean “chaste women” in this context.
Others say that it refers only to the women of Jewish and Christian communities who are living under Islamic rule. As regards those living in regions that are hostile to Islam, Muslims are not permitted to marry such women.
He mentions an important condition for marrying a woman of the People of the Book, which every Muslim who wants to marry such a woman in a non-Muslim country should pay attention to. This condition is that he should be in a position where he is not afraid that his child will be forced into kufr.
One of the obvious implications of this in our time is that a Muslim should not put himself in a position where he will be forced to raise his child as a kaafir in a non-Muslim country, where a child may be forced to study something about Christianity, for example, or he may be taken to church on Sundays, or the law may be on the side of the non-Muslim woman, allowing her to take her child wherever she wants and raise him in her family’s religion, etc. We ask Allaah to keep us safe from all that and we seek refuge with Him from being forsaken.
Shaykh al-Sa’di said in his Tafseer (commentary on the Qur’aan), 1/458:
“‘… (lawful to you in marriage) are chaste women – i.e., free and chaste - from the believers and chaste women –free and chaste - from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before your time…’ i.e., from among the Jews and Christians. This is adding specific details to the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): ‘And do not marry al-mushrikaat (idolatresses, etc.) till they believe (worship Allaah alone)…’ [al-Baqarah 2:221].”
As for promiscuous women, those who do not keep themselves chaste and free from immoral sexual conduct, it is not permitted to marry them, whether they are Muslims or from among the People of the Book (Jews and Christians), unless they repent, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Let no man guilty of fornication or adultery marry any but a woman similarly guilty, or an unbeliever: nor let any but such a man or an unbeliever marry such a woman: to the Believers such a thing is forbidden.” [al-Noor 24:3]

   Salam elkum.
First I would really like to commend you on the substantial information
      you have provided to the public. May God reward you all on your efforts. I do realize that
      every single question cannot be answered directly. However, I have done a lot of research
      on this matter and still I have come up with no answers to my question. What makes it even
      more difficult is the lack of knowledge of Islam from my parents perspective. I was born
      in Canada and one of the very few young teenage girls fighting to learn more about Islam.
      Unfortunatly, there is still a lot I do not know about our religion, yet I work at it
      every day.
    Getting down to my problem, I am 19 years old and just got engaged to a Lebanese Muslim fellow. After getting engaged to this person I found
      out that in the past he has been with other girls and intimate relationships, before
      marriage. Of course, I realize that in our religon that is very wrong. Now I am left with
      the decision of whether to go ahead and get married to this person or not. I personally
      think that I shouldn't be with a person who has done such things while my family says
      forgive and forget... However, I would like your opinion on this matter. Is it ideal and
      acceptable for someone like myself to marry a person of this nature even if it was his
      past.
    Thank you so much for your time . I would appreciate it if you had a
      chance to reply it would fill up so many unanswered questions but of course I fully
      understand if you cannot do so .

      don't fully answer my questions. Thanks again kindly for your time .",,,"Praise be to Allah.First of all, may Allaah reward you with good for your kind words. We
    apologize for not answering questions in full. With regard to your question about this man
    who has asked for your hand in marriage, what you should concentrate on is the way he is
    now: is he doing his religious duties, like the five daily prayers, etc., is he keeping
    away from haraam things, has he repented for what he did in the past? Or not? If he is
    keeping his duty towards Allaah, then this is the good commitment to religion that is
    required according to the command of the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be
    upon him): If there comes to you with an offer of marriage (for your daughter,
    sister, etc.) one with whose religious commitment and character you are pleased, then
    marry (your daughter, sister, etc, to) him. If you do not do so, there will be mischief on
    earth and widespread corruption. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 1004; classed as
    hasan in Saheeh al-Jaami, 270)
    It is not permitted to bring up the past of a person who
    regrets it and has repented and given up his sin; rather, this should be covered up.
    Whoever covers up his Muslim brother in this world, Allaah will cover him up in the
    Hereafter. (A saheeh hadeeth reported by Imaam Ahmad; Saheeh
    al-Jaami, 6287)
    But if a person is immoral and corrupt, and still has
    relationships from before, then you should never, ever agree to marry him. Allaah says
    (interpretation of the meaning): The adulterer marries not but an adulteress or a
    mushrikah. And the woman who agrees to marry a mushrik or an adulterer, then she is either
    a prostitute or a mushrikah. Such a thing is forbidden to the believers. [al-Noor
    24:3]
Ibn Katheer said, commenting on the phrase Such a thing is forbidden
    to the believers: i.e., (it is forbidden for) a man to marry an immoral woman,
    or for a chaste woman to marry an immoral man. Hence Imaam Ahmad ibn Hanbal said that the
    marriage contract between a chaste man and an immoral woman is invalid, so long as she
    remains like this, unless she is asked to repent and she does so, in which case the
    contract becomes valid, otherwise it is not valid. Similarly, the marriage of a free,
    chaste woman to a promiscuous, immoral man is invalid unless he repents sincerely, because
    Allaah says Such a thing is forbidden to the believers. 
There is no secret about the mischief, misery and problems that result
    from marriage to an immoral man.
In many cases it is very difficult to get a true picture of a person
    and be sure about whether he is chaste or otherwise. But by researching, asking questions,
    consulting people and asking them for advice, whilst taking ones time and asking
    Allaah for help, one can get answers. We ask Allaah to choose the best for you, to help
    you and to guide you. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

We are happy to provide you with a detailed answer to your question and more, in the hope that it may open the way to great good for you.
Among the signs of the greatness of the blessed Islamic Shari`ah is the fact that there is no good thing, major or minor, that it has not commanded us to do or pointed the way to it, and there is no bad thing, major or minor, that it has not warned us against or forbidden. 
The Shari`ah is perfect and complete in all aspects, a fact which has often greatly astonished non-Muslims and earned their admiration. 
At the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)), one of the polytheists said to the Prophet’s Companion, Salman al-Farsi (may Allah be pleased with him),: Your Prophet has taught you everything, even how to defecate! Salman said: Yes, he forbade us to face the qiblah when urinating or defecating (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, no. 16; he said it is a sahih hasan hadith; also reported in Sahih Muslim and elsewhere). 
Islamic Shari`ah includes a number of rules and manners to be followed when answering the call of nature, including the following:

Not to face the qiblah (direction of prayer, i.e. the Ka`bah which was built in Makkah by Ibrahim, upon whom be peace, as commanded by Allah) when urinating or defecating. This is out of respect for the Qiblah and for the symbols and rituals of Allah. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: When any one of you sits down to answer the call of nature, he should not face the qiblah or turn his back towards it. ( Muslim, 389)
He should not touch his penis with his right hand when urinating, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: When any one of you urinates, he should not hold his penis in his right hand or clean it with his right hand; and (when drinking), he should not breathe into the vessel. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 150)
He should not remove impurity with his right hand; the left hand should be used for this purpose, because of the hadith quoted above, and because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: When any one of you wipes himself, he should not use his right hand. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 5199)

The Prophet’s wife, Hafsah (may Allah be pleased with her), reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to use his right hand for eating, drinking, making wudu, getting dressed, and giving and taking things, and he used to use his left hand for other things. (Reported by Imam Ahmad; see also Sahih al-Jami’, 4912 
Abu Hurayrah reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: When any one of you cleans himself, he should not use his right hand, he should use his left hand. (Reported by Ibn Majah, 308; see also Sahih al-Jami’, 322)

The Sunnah is to answer the call of nature sitting, making oneself close to the ground, because this is more concealing, and makes it less likely that spray from one's urine will come back on one's body or clothes, making them dirty. If a person can be sure of avoiding this, then it is permissible to urinate standing up .
A person should be concealed from the sight of others when answering the call of nature. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to prefer to go behind a rise in the ground or a garden of date palms. (Reported by Muslim, 517)

If a person is out in an open space and cannot find anything to conceal him when he needs to answer the call of nature, he should move far away from the other people around him, because al-Mughirah ibn Shu'bah said: I was with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) on a journey, when he felt the need to answer the call of nature, so he went far away. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 20; he said it is a sahih hasan hadith)
‘Abd-Allah ibn Abi Qurad said: I went out with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to an open space, and when he needed to answer the call of nature, he moved away. (Reported by al-Nasai, 16; see also Sahih al-Jami’, 4651)

A person should not uncover his `awrah (private parts) until after he has squatted close to the ground, because this is more concealing, as Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) reported: When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wanted to answer the call of nature, he would not lift his garment until he had squatted close to the ground. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 14; see also Sahih al-Jami’, 4652)

If a person is in a (modern) toilet, he should not lift his garment until he has closed the door and is out of sight of other people. 
With regard to this point and the one before, it is worth noting that the habit of many people in the West and elsewhere, of urinating in a standing position in front of other people in public toilets (using urinals) is something which goes against good manners, modesty and decency, and is repulsive to anyone who possesses sound common sense and wisdom. How can anybody uncover in front of other people the `awrah (private parts) which Allah has placed between his legs to conceal it and commanded him to cover it? The idea that it should be covered is well established among all wise and decent people of all races. It is wrong in principle to build restrooms of this shameful type, where the users can see one another, thus making them worse than some kinds of animals whose habit is to conceal themselves from one another when urinating or defecating.

It is also good manners according to Shari`ah to recite certain adhkar (supplications) when entering or leaving the toilet , which are quite appropriate to the situation and place. Our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught us that when entering the toilet, we should say: Allahumma inni a’udhi bika min al-khubthi wal-khabaith (O Allah, I seek refuge with You from male and female devils). When leaving the toilet, he should say: Ghufranak (I seek Your forgiveness).
He should be careful to remove all impurity after answering the call of nature, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) warned against being careless in cleaning oneself after urinating : Most of the punishment of the grave will be because of urine. (Reported by Ibn Majah, 342; see also Sahih al-Jami’, 1202)

Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both) reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) passed by two graves, and said: They are being punished, but they are not being punished for any major sin. One of them used not to protect himself (i.e. keep himself clean from) his urine, and the other used to walk about spreading malicious gossip. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 5592)

Any impurity should be washed or wiped three times or an odd number of times greater than three, according to whatever is needed to cleanse it, because `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to wash his posterior three times. Ibn ‘Umar said: We did this too and found it to be healing and cleansing. (Reported by Ibn Majah, 350; see also Sahih al-Jami’, 4993) Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: When anyone of you cleans himself (with stones or similar material) let him use an odd number. (Reported by Imam Ahmad; classed as hasan in Sahih al-Jami’, 375)
He should not use bones or dung to clean himself or wipe away the impurity, rather, he should use tissue, stones, and the like. Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that he used to carry a vessel for the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to do wudu and clean himself after answering the call of nature. Whilst he was following him, he (the Prophet) asked, Who is that? He said: I am Abu Hurayrah. He said: Get me some stones I can use to clean myself, but do not bring me any bones or dung. So I brought him some stones, carrying them in the hem of my garment, and placed them by his side, then I went away. When he had finished, I came back and asked him, What is wrong with bones and dung? He said: They are the food of the jinn. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 3571)
A person should not urinate into stagnant water, because Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade anyone to urinate into stagnant water (reported by Muslim, 423), and because this makes the water impure and harms those who use it.
A person should not urinate by the roadside or in places where people seek shade, because this is offensive to them. Abu Hurayrah reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Fear the two things that bring curses. They asked, What are the two things that bring curses, O Messenger of Allah? He said: When a person relieves himself in the road where people walk or in the place where they seek shade. (Reported by Abu Dawud, 23; see also Sahih al-Jami’, 110)
One should not greet a person who is answering the call of nature , or return a greeting whilst one is answering the call of nature, out of respect to Allah by not mentioning His name in a dirty place . Jabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah reported that a man passed by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) whilst he was urinating, and greeted him. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him: If you see me in this state, do not greet me, because if you do, I will not respond. (Reported by Ibn Majah, 346; see also Sahih al-Jami’, 575) The majority of scholars say that it is makruh (disliked) to speak in the restroom unnecessarily.

These are some of the rules and manners prescribed by the Shari`ah of Islam in this matter which is repeated many times a day by every person. If the Shari`ah has paid such minute attention to the details of such a mundane matter, what do you think it has to say about more important issues? Do you know of any other religion or system in the world that has brought laws like this? This is enough, by Allah, to prove its perfection and beauty, and the necessity of following it. We ask Allah to give us and you strength and to guide us all to the truth. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.

But I'm worried that this might be 'shirk'. Please answer soon; I hope to go for an Umrah in the near future and visit his grave too, insya Allah.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Al-Daaraqutni reported in his Sunan (2/278) with an isnaad from Haatib that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever visits me after I die, it is as if he visited me when I was still alive…” This is a hadith which many of the scholars of hadith judged to be false and not to have been reported with a saheeh isnaad from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Among the scholars who voiced this opinion was al-Haafiz al-Dhahabi in Lisaan al-Meezaan (4/285), in his biography of one of the narrators, Haaroon ibn Abi Qaz’ah. Al-Dhahabi said: “…Haaroon ibn Abi Qaz’ah al-Madani [reported] from a man” – about visiting the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Al-Bukhari said: “This is not to be accepted or followed.”
Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said in Lisaan al-Meezaan (6/217): “Al-Azdi said: ‘Haaroon Abu Qaz’ah reports mursal ahadith from a man of Aal Haatib.’ I [Ibn Hajar] say: from this we understand that what he is referring to is al-Azdi. Ya’qoob ibn Shaybah also classed him as da’eef (weak).”
Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar also mentioned him in al-Talkhees al-Habeer, in his comment on the ahadith of al-Raafa’i al-Kabeer (2/266). He said, “In his isnaad is the unknown [majhool] man” – meaning a man from Aal Haatib.
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah said in al-Tawassul wa’l-Waseelah (p. 134) about this hadith: “It is obviously a lie that goes against Islam. Anyone who visited him during his lifetime and believed in him, was one of his Companions, especially if he was among those who migrated to join him or fought alongside him. It is proven that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Do not slander my Companions, for by the One in Whose hand is my soul, if any one of you were to spend gold equal to the size of Uhud, it would not equal the deeds of one of them, not even half of it.’
[Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim]. Anyone who comes after the Sahaabah cannot be like the Sahaabah by doing obligatory duties such as Hajj, jihaad, the five daily prayers and sending blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), so how can he become equal to them by doing something that is not obligatory according to the consensus of the Muslims? We are not even supposed to travel for this purpose, in fact it is forbidden to do so. However, travelling to the [Prophet’s] Mosque, and to al-Masjid al-Aqsaa [in Jerusalem], for the purpose of praying there, is mustahabb (encouraged), and travelling to the Ka’bah for Hajj is waajib (obligatory). If a person who undertakes a journey that is waajib or mustahabb still cannot be like one of the Sahaabah who travelled to visit the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) during his lifetime, how can they achieve this by undertaking a journey that is not allowed?”
He also said (p. 133): “All of the ahadith about visiting his grave are da’eef, and are not to be relied upon in matters of religion. For this reason none of the authors of books of Saheeh and Sunan reported them at all; they were only narrated by those who reported da’eef ahadith, such as al-Daaraqutni, al-Bazzaar and others.
Shaykh al-Albaani said in al-Da’eefah (no. 1021) about this hadith: it is baatil (false). He mentioned what is wrong with the hadith, namely the man who is not named, and classed Haaroon Abu Qaz’ah as da’eef. There is a third fault with the hadith, which is that it causes confusion and contradiction. Then Shaykh al-Albaani said: “In general, the isnaad of this hadith is weak.”
He also said in al-Da’eefah (no. 47): “many people think that Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and those who follow him among the Salafis forbid visiting the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) altogether. This is a lie and a fabrication, and it is not the only lie told about Ibn Taymiyah, may Allah have mercy on him, or about the Salafis. Everyone who reads the books of Ibn Taymiyah will see that he says it is permissible to visit his grave (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and that doing so is recommended (mustahabb), so long as it is not associated with any objectionable practices or innovations (bid’ah), such as travelling solely for that purpose, because of the hadith “No one should set out purposely except to visit three mosques.” The hadith does not describe a ban only on travelling to visit other mosques, as many people think; it also includes a ban on setting out to visit any place which people think will bring them closer to Allah, whether it is a mosque, a grave or any other place. This is indicated by the hadith narrated by Abu Hurayrah who said: ‘I met Basrah ibn Abi Basrah al-Ghifaari and he asked me, ‘Where are you coming from?’ I said, ‘From al-Toor [Sinai].’ He said, ‘If I had met you before you left, you would not have gone there! I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: ‘Do not travel except to three mosques.’”
(Reported by Ahmad and others with a saheeh isnaad).
This clearly indicates that the Sahaabah understood the hadith to be general in application [i.e., it did not apply only to mosques]. This is supported by the fact that it is not reported that any of them ever set out with the intention of visiting a grave. They are the predecessors of Ibn Taymiyah in this regard, so whoever condemns Ibn Taymiyah is in effect condemning the salaf (the righteous predecessors), may Allah be pleased with them. May Allah have mercy on the one who said:
“All goodness is in following those who went before (the salaf)
and all evil is in following the innovations of those who came later.”
In conclusion, travelling with the intention of visiting the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is bid’ah and is haraam, because of the hadith which forbids travelling to worship in any place except the three mosques. As for visiting the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when one happens to be in Madeenah, this is perfectly acceptable, as is travelling with the intention of praying in the Prophet’s Mosque as an act of worship and seeking to draw close to Allah. Those that are confused about this issue are those who do not understand the difference between what is permitted and what is forbidden.

How to avoid fortune-telling","Praise be to Allah.Are horoscopes haram?
Astrology , horoscopes, superstition and fortune-telling are all actions of ignorance which Islam came to show as false and to explain that they are acts of polytheism. This is because they involve depending on something other than Allah and believing that benefit and harm come from something other than Him, and believing the words of fortune-tellers and soothsayers who falsely claim to have knowledge of the unseen in order to cheat people of their money and change their beliefs. 
Evidence for prohibiting zodiac signs in Islam
The evidence for that is the hadith narrated by Abu Dawud in his Sunan with a sahih isnad from Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever learns anything of astrology has learned a branch of witchcraft (al-sihr)…” 
Al-Bazzar narrated with a sound chain of transmission from ‘Imran ibn Husayn that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “He is not one of us who practises augury or has it done for him, who tells fortunes or has his fortune told, or who practises witchcraft or has that done for him.” Whoever claims to know some matter of the unseen either is a fortune-teller or is acting like a fortune-teller in some sense, because Allah is the only One Who has knowledge of the unseen. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning);
“Say: ‘None in the heavens and the earth knows the Ghayb (Unseen) except Allah…’” [al-Naml 27:65]
How to avoid fortune-telling
My advice to everyone who has anything to do with these matters is to repent to Allah and ask for His forgiveness, and to depend only on Allah and to put their trust in Him in all their affairs, whilst following the practical means that are prescribed or permitted in shari’ah. They should give up these matters of jahiliyyah, keep away from them and avoid asking the people who practise them or believe what they say, out of obedience to AllahAllah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of AllahAllah be upon him), and in order to protect his commitment to Islam and his ‘aqidah (religious belief).

      bless our Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) ,Wassalam.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The hadeeth you mention was narrated by Imaam al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have
    mercy on him) in his Saheeh from Abu Hurayrah from the Prophet 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him), who said (that Allaah said): “Vowing does not bring
    to the son of Adam anything that I have not already written in his Qadar (preordainments),
    but vowing is imposed on him by way of preordainment. Through vowing I make a miser spend
    of his wealth.” (Saheeh al-Bukhaari, no. 6119)
Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on this
    hadeeth:
“Ibn ‘Umar said: ‘The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him) forbade the making of vows.’ … A clear statement prohibiting
    vows came in the report of al-‘Alaa’ ibn ‘Abd al-Rahmaan from his father
    from Abu Hurayrah, recorded by Muslim in the words ‘Do not make vows,’ and in
    the phrase ‘(Making vows) does not bring forward anything or delay anything [i.e., it
    has no effect whatsoever],’ and in the report of ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Murrah,
    ‘It does not change anything,’ – which is more general. A similar phrase
    was reported in the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah: ‘Vowing does not bring to the son of
    Adam anything that I have not already written in his Qadar (preordainments)…’
    Ibn al-Atheer said in al-Nihaayah: ‘The point of the hadeeth is that he told
    them that this thing (making vows) does not bring any immediate benefit or turn away any
    immediate harm, and it does not change what has been decreed. Thus he said, Do not make
    vows, as you know that you cannot get, or turn away, anything by means of vows that Allaah
    has not already decreed for you. If you make a vow then fulfill it, because whatever you
    have vowed becomes obligatory for you.’ (Then Ibn Hajar quotes the opinions of a
    number of scholars on the reason why making vows is prohibited): … The reason may be
    that the person who makes a vow does not do so in order to draw closer to Allaah, but will
    only do so if he gets what he wanted, as if this is an exchange, which corrupts his
    intention to draw closer to Allaah. This interpretation is indicated by the words,
    ‘It does not bring any good,’ and ‘Vowing does not bring to the son of Adam
    anything that I have not already written in his Qadar (preordainments).’ This is a
    clear statement as to why vows should not be made. The phrase ‘it does not bring any
    good’ means that the end result will be no good, and it might be too difficult to
    fulfil the vow, or it might mean that (the vow) will not bring about good if it has not
    been decreed for him…. Al-Nawawi said: ‘The phrase “it does not bring any
    good” means that it will not stop anything that has already been decreed, as is clear
    from the other reports.’ … (Then Ibn Hajar quotes from Ibn Daqeeq al-‘Eed),
    saying that he described the difference between nadhr al-mujaazaah (vow of
    repayment, one in which an act of worship is promised in return for a favour), which is
    forbidden, and nadhr al-ibtidaa’ (vow of initiative, where one does the
    promised act of worship first, without waiting to see if the favour is granted or not),
    which is a pure act of worship.”
In al-Mufahhim, al-Qurtubi confirmed the idea that the ahaadeeth
    forbid nadhr al-mujaazaah: ‘This refers to a situation where a man might say,
    for example, “If Allaah heals this person who is sick, I will give such-and-such in
    charity.” The reason why it is disliked is that he postpones doing the act of worship
    mentioned, and makes it conditional upon getting the desired result. This makes it quite
    clear that he does not have the sincere intention of drawing closer to Allaah, because he
    has clearly stated that his approach is that of giving something in return for something.
    It is quite clear that if the sick person is not healed, he will not give the charity
    which is conditional upon the sick person’s recovery. This is the attitude of the
    miser, who does not give anything of his wealth except in exchange for some immediate
    return, usually something that is worth more than what he is prepared to give. This is
    what is referred to in the hadeeth: “Through vowing I make a miser spend of his
    wealth.” To this could be added the point that there is an ignorant belief that
    making a vow guarantees that one will get the desired result, or that Allaah will do what
    a person wants because of the vow. Both notions are addressed in the hadeeth: “Vowing
    does not bring to the son of Adam anything that I have not already written in his Qadar
    (preordainments).”’ Concerning the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): “They
    (are those who) fulfil (their) vows…” [al-Insaan 76:7] al-Tabaraani reported
    with a saheeh isnaad that Qutaadah said: “They used to vow to do acts of worship such
    as praying, fasting, giving zakaat and going on pilgrimage (Hajj and ‘Umrah), and
    other acts which were obligatory for them, and so Allaah called them abraar (those
    who are pious, fear Allaah, and avoid evil – see al-Insaan 76:5). It is clear
    that it is not those who make vows of repayment (nadhr al-mujaazaah) who are
    praised…”
Al-Baydaawi said: “People usually make vows conditional upon gaining
    some benefit or removing some evil, and this is forbidden because it is the way of the
    miser. If a generous person wants to draw closer to Allaah, he starts doing good deeds
    straight away, but the miser would never voluntarily give anything except in return for
    something which he is given first. This attitude will not protect him from anything that
    has already been decreed, or bring him any good thing that has not been decreed for him.
    The vow will be in accordance with qadar and will make him give something that he would
    not have given otherwise… And Allaah knows best.”",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

Reading the Quran during menses is one of the issues on which the scholars, may Allah have mercy on them, differed.
The majority of fuqaha say that it is haram for a woman to recite Quran during her period, until she is tahir (pure) again. The only exceptions they make is in the case of dhikr (remembrance of Allah) and phrases that are not intended as tilawah (recitation), such as saying “Bismillahi’r-Rahmani’r-Rahim” or “Inna Lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji’un”, or other phrases from the Quran which are repeated as general du’as.
Evidence for forbidding women from reading the Quran during menses
They base their evidence for forbidding menstruating women to recite Quran on several things, including the following:
1- Menstruation is seen as coming under the rulings that apply to one who is junub (in a state of impurity following sexual intercourse), because both states require ghusl. This is based on the hadith narrated by ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to teach the Quran and he never prevented anyone from learning it except those who were in a state of janabah (major ritual impurity).” (Reported by Abu Dawud, 1/281; al-Tirmidhi, 146; al-Nasai, 1/144; Ibn Majah, 1/207; Ahmad, 1/84; Ibn Khuzaymah, 1/104. Al-Tirmidhi said: a sahih hasan hadith. Al-Hafiz ibn Hajar said: the truth is that it is the type of hasan hadith that could be used as evidence).
2- The hadith of Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both), according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The menstruating woman and the one who is in a state of major ritual impurity (janabah) should not recite anything of the Quran.” (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 131; Ibn Majah, 595; al-Daraqutni (1/117); al-Bayhaqi, 1/89. This is a da’if hadith, because it was reported by Isma’il ibn ‘Ayyash from the Hijazis, and his reports from them are da’if as is well known to those who are conversant with the study of hadith. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said (21/460): it is a da’if hadith by the unanimous agreement of the scholars of hadith. See Nasb al-Rayah, 1/195; al-Talkhis al-Habir, 1/183).
Evidence for allowing women to read the Quran during menses
Some scholars say that it is permitted for a menstruating woman to recite Quran. This is the opinion of Malik, and one opinion narrated from Ahmad, which Ibn Taymiyah preferred and which al-Shawkani believed to be correct. The scholars based the following points on this opinion:
1- The principle is that things are allowed and permitted unless there is evidence to the contrary. There is no such evidence to say that a menstruating woman is not allowed to recite Quran. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: “There is no clear, sahih text to indicate that a menstruating woman is forbidden to recite Quran… It is known that women used to menstruate at the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and he did not forbid them to recite Quran, or to remember Allah (dhikr) and offer du’a.”
2- Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, commands (Muslims) to recite Quran. He praises the one who does so, and promises him (or her) a great reward. No one is excluded from this except the one concerning whom there is solid evidence (dalil), and there is no such evidence in the case of menstruating women, as stated above.
3- The analogy between the menstruating woman and the one who is in a state of janabah is made despite the fact that there are differences between them. The one who is in a state of janabah has the option of removing the “barrier” by making ghusl, unlike the menstruating woman. A woman’s period usually lasts for some length of time, whereas the person who is in a state of janabah is required to do ghusl when the time for prayer comes.
4- Preventing a menstruating woman from reciting Quran deprives her of the chance to earn reward, and it may make her forget something of the Quran, or she may need to recite it for the purposes of teaching or learning.
From the above, it is clear that the evidence of those who allow a menstruating woman to recite Quran is stronger. If a woman wants to err on the side of caution, she can limit her recitation to the passages which she is afraid of forgetting.
Touching the Quran during menses 
It is very important to note that what we have been discussing here is restricted to what a menstruating woman recites from memory. When it comes to reading from the Mus-haf (the Arabic text itself), a different rule applies. 
The correct view of the scholars is that it is forbidden to touch the mus-haf when one is in any kind of state of impurity, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… which none can touch except the purified.” [al-Waqi’ah 56:79]
In a letter to ‘Amr ibn Hazm, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told the people of Yemen: “No one should touch the Quran except one who is tahir (pure).” 
The hadith is reported by Malik, 1/199; al-Nasai, 8/57; Ibn Hibban, 793; al-Bayhaqi, 1/87. Al-Hafiz ibn Hajar said: A group of scholars classed this hadith as sahih because it is so well known. Al-Shafi'i said: It is proven by them that it was a letter sent by the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said: “This letter is famous among the scholars of sirah, and is so well known among the scholars that it does not need an isnad. It is like tawatur because the people accepted and recognized it. Shaykh al-Albani said that it is sahih. Al-Talkhis al-Habir, 4/17. See also: Nasb al-Rayah, 1/196; Irwa al-Ghalil, 1/158).
(Hashiyat Ibn ‘Abidin, 1/159; al-Majmu’, 1/356; Kashshaf al-Qina’, 1/147; al-Mughni, 3/461; Nayl al-Awtar, 1/226; Majmi’ al-Fatawa, 21/460; al-Sharh al-Mumti’ li’l-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 1/291)

Does blood donation break wudu?","Praise be to Allah.Is blood donation halal?
If it is necessary to carry out a blood transfusion , there is no sin on the patient, the doctors or the donor, because of the following:
1.      Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… and if anyone saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life of all mankind…” [al-Maidah 5:32]. 
This verse indicates the virtue of being the cause of saving the life of someone whom it is forbidden to kill, and there is no doubt that the doctors and blood donors are among the causes of saving the life of patients who are at risk of dying if a blood transfusion is not carried out.
2.                Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “He has forbidden you only the dead animals, and blood, and the flesh of swine, and that which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for other than Allah. But if one is forced by necessity without wilful disobedience nor transgressing due limits, then there is no sin on him. Truly, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [al-Baqarah 2:173]. 
This verse indicates that there is no sin on the one who does a forbidden thing out of necessity; the sick person accepts a blood transfusion out of necessity, and there is nothing wrong with the donor giving his blood either.
3.                The guidelines of Islamic Shari`ah dictate that donating blood should be permitted, because one of its principles is that in cases of necessity, things that are ordinarily forbidden are permitted, and that ways should be found to ease hardship. The sick person is certainly in a hardship situation, and is compelled by necessity. The hardship he is facing could lead to his death, so it is permissible for him to receive a blood transfusion. (For more details on the issue of donating blood, please see Question #2570 ).
Does blood donation break wudu?
As regards the question of whether wudu is broken by the flowing of blood, this is an issue concerning which the scholars, may Allah have mercy on them, differed. Those who think that bleeding breaks wudu quote as evidence the hadith of Abu’l-Darda (may Allah be pleased with him): “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) vomited, then did wudu.” They drew an analogy between vomit and blood, because both are najis (impure) when they come out of the body.
This hadith was narrated by Ahmad (4/449), Abu Dawud (2981) and al-Tirmidhi (87), who said: “More than one of the scholars among the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and others among the Tabi’in thought that wudu should be done after vomiting or having a nosebleed. This is the opinion of Sufyan al-Thawri, Ibn al-Mubarak, Ahmad and Ishaq. Some scholars said that wudu is not necessary after vomiting or having a nosebleed. This is the opinion of Malik and al-Shafi’i.” This was also narrated as being the opinion of Ahmad. Al-Baghawi said: It is the opinion of most of the Sahabah and Tabi’in.”
The most correct view is that bleeding does not break one’s wudu, although it is preferable (mustahabb) to make wudu after bleeding. The evidence for this is as follows:
1.      Wudu is considered to be valid until there is proof that something breaks it. There is no proof narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that bleeding breaks wudu , hence Imam al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said, “There is no proof whatsoever that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) made it obligatory to do wudu because of that (bleeding).” Shaykh Ibn Sa’di (may Allah have mercy on him) said, the correct opinion is that bleeding and vomiting , etc., do not break wudu, whether they are large or small in volume, because there is no evidence to prove that they break wudu, and the guiding principle is that wudu remains valid.
2.      One cannot draw an analogy between blood and anything else, because the reasons behind them are not the same.
3.      The idea that bleeding breaks wudu is contrary to what was reported from the salaf (early generations), for example, ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) continued to pray although his wound was pouring with blood. Al-Hasan al-Basri (may Allah have mercy on him) said, “The Muslims continue to pray even when they are wounded.”
4.      The fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did wudu after he vomited does not indicate that it is obligatory to do so, because the rules of fiqh say that the mere fact that he did something, unless it was accompanied by a command to do it, does not make it obligatory. All that this proves is that it is good to follow the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in this instance. Hence Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Doing wudu after cupping and vomiting is mustahabb and is good.”
To sum up the above, it is mustahabb (preferable) for a blood donor to do wudu after giving blood, but if he does not do wudu, it is still OK.

Does masturbation break your fast?","Praise be to Allah.Is masturbation haram?
No doubt masturbation is haram according to most of the scholars, as Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said. If this happens in Ramadan, this is worse, and if there is ejaculation of sperm because of the masturbation , the violation of the sanctity of the fast is even more severe in sin. 
Does masturbation break your fast?
From the time the maniy (semen) is ejaculated, the fast is broken, but the person should still fast for the rest of that day. It is not permissible for him to stop fasting, because of the sanctity of the month. 
You have to repent for breaking your fast by deliberately ejaculating, and you also have to repent for not keeping the fast for the rest of the day and for violating the sanctity of the fast by doing something else that broke the fast, namely eating food. 
You also have to fast one day to make up for breaking your fast. Increase the number of good deeds (hasanat) you do and observe nafl (supererogatory) fasts, for good deeds (hasanat) cancel out bad deeds (sayyiat). And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.

My questions is, what exactelly is the person allowed to see exactelly?
Is he allowed to see her hair (entire head) ?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Islam commands us to lower our gaze and forbids looking at non-mahram women. This is in order to purify people’s souls and protect their honour. There are, however, certain exceptions in which it is permissible to look at a non-mahram woman for reasons of necessity, one of which is in the case of proposing marriage, because it is the basis on which a very important decision affecting a person’s life will be taken. There are texts which indicate that it is permissible to look at one’s fiancée, as follows:


From Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘If one of you proposes marriage to a woman, if he can look at her to see that which will encourage him to go ahead and marry her, then let him do so.’ I proposed marriage to a young woman, and I used to hide where I could see her, until I saw that which encouraged me to go ahead and marry her, so I did so.’” According to another report he said, ‘a young woman of Bani Salamah. I used to hide from her, until I saw that which encouraged me to go ahead and marry her, so I did so.”


(Saheeh Abi Dawood, no. 1832, 1834)
From Abu Hurayrah: “I was with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when a man came and told him that he had married a woman of the Ansaar. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him, ‘Have you seen her?’ He said, ‘No.’ He said, ‘Go and look at her, for there is something in the eyes of the Ansaar.”
(Reported by Muslim, no. 1424; and by al-Daaraqutni, 3/253 (34))
From al-Mugheerah ibn Shu’bah: “I proposed marriage to a woman, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Have you seen her?’ I said, ‘No.’ He said, ‘Look at her, because it is more fitting that love and compatibility be established between you.’” According to another report: “So he did that, and he married her and mentioned that they got along.”
(Reported by al-Daaraqutni, 3/252 (31, 32); Ibn Maajah, 1/574)
From Sahl ibn Sa’d (may Allah be pleased with him): “A woman came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: “O Messenger of Allah, I have come to give myself to you (in marriage).” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) looked at her closely, then he lowered his head. When the woman saw that he had not made a decision about her, she sat down. One of his Companions stood up and said, O Messenger of Allah, if you do not want her, then marry her to me…’”
(Reported by al-Bukhaari, 7/19; Muslim, 4/143; al-Nisaa’i, 6/113 bi Sharh al-Suyooti; al-Bayhaqi, 7/84)
The sayings of the scholars on the extent to which one may look at one’s fiancée
Al-Shaafa’i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “If he wants to marry a woman, he is not allowed to see her without a headcover. He may look at her face and hands when she is covered, with or without her permission. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘… and not to show off their adornment except only that which is apparent…’ [al-Noor 24:31]. He said: ‘The face and hands.’”
(al-Haawi al-Kabeer, 9/34).
Imaam al-Nawawi said in Rawdat al-Taalibeen wa ‘Umdat al-Mufteen (7, 19-20): “When (a man) wants to marry (a woman), it is preferable (mustahabb) for him to look at her so that he will have no regrets. According to another view, it is not preferable but it is allowed. The first view is correct because of the ahaadeeth, and it is permitted to look repeatedly, with or without her permission. If it is not easy to look at her, he may send a woman to check her out and describe her to him. A woman may also look at a man if she wants to marry him, for she will like in him what he likes in her. What is permissible for him to look at is the face and hands, front and back. He should not look at anything else.”
Abu Haneefah permitted looking at the feet as well as the face and hands.
(Bidaayah al-Mujtahid wa Nihayyat al-Muqtasid, 3/10)
“It is permissible to look at the face, hands and feet, and no more than that.” Ibn Rushd also quoted it as above.
Among the reports from the madhhab of Imaam Maalik:


He may look at the face and hands only.


He may look at the face, hands and forearms only.


A number of reports were narrated from Imaam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him), one of which says that he may look at the face and forearms.
The second says that he may look at what usually appears such as the neck, calves and so on.
This was quoted by Ibn Qudaamah in al-Mughni (7/454), Imaam Ibn al-Qayyim al-Jawziyyah in Tahdheeb al-Sunan (3/25-26), and al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar in Fath al-Baari (11/78)… The reliable opinion in the books of the Hanbalis is the second opinion.
From the above, it is clear that the majority of scholars say that a man is allowed to look at his fiancée’s face and hands, because the face indicates beauty or ugliness, and the hands indicate the slimness or plumpness (literally, ‘fertility’) of the body.
Abu’l-Faraj al-Maqdisi said: “There is no dispute among the scholars that he is permitted to look at the face.. the focus of beauty and the place at which one looks.”
Ruling on touching one’s fiancée or being alone with her
Al-Zayla’i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “It is not permissible for him to touch her face or hands – even if is sure that this will not provoke desire – because she is still haraam for him, and there is no need for him to do so.” In Durar al-Bihaar it says: “It is not permitted for the qaadi, the witnesses or the fiancé to touch her, even if they are sure that this will not provoke desire, because there is no need for that…”
(Radd al-Muhtaar ‘ala’l-Durr al-Mukhtaar, 5/237)
Ibn Qudaamah said: “It is not permitted for him to be alone with her, because she is forbidden and Islam only allows him to look, thus khulwah (being alone with her) remains forbidden, and because there is no certainty that nothing forbidden will take place if he is alone with her, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘No man is alone with a woman, but the Shaytaan is the third one present.’ He should not look at her in a lustful or suspicious manner. Ahmad said, in a report narrated by Saalih, ‘He may look at the face, but not in a lustful manner.’ He may look repeatedly, and examine her beauty, because the aim cannot be achieved in any other way.”
The fiancée’s permission to look
A man is permitted to look at the woman to whom he wishes to propose marriage, even without her permission or knowledge. This is what is indicated by the saheeh ahaadeeth.
Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said in Fath al-Baari (9/157): “The majority of scholars said: he is permitted to look at her if he wishes without her permission.”
The hadith scholar Shaykh Muhammad Naasir al-Deen al-Albani said in al-Silsilat al-Saheehah (1/156), supporting this view: “Similar evidence is seen in the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the hadith, ‘Even if she does not know.’ This is supported by the actions of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them), in accordance with the Sunnah, such as Muhammad ibn Muslimah and Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah, both of whom hid so as to see of their fiancées that which would encourage them to go ahead and marry them…”
Note:
Shaykh al-Albani also said (op.cit., p. 156):
“From Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him)” ‘The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wanted to marry a woman, so he sent another woman to look at her and said, “Smell her mouth (front teeth) and look at the back of her ankles.”
(Reported by al-Haakim, 2/166, who said it is saheeh according to the conditions of Muslim, and al-Dhahabi agreed with him. Also reported by al-Bayhaqi, 7/87. In Majma’ al-Zawaa’id (4/507) he said, ‘”Reported by Ahmad and al-Bazzaar, and the men of al-Bazzaar are thiqaat.”)
In Mughni al-Muhtaaj (2/128) it says: “What we understand from this report is that the one who is sent may describe to the one who sends her more than that which he himself may see, so this sending achieves more than just looking.”

Etiquette of using siwak


Using one's fingers to clean one's mouth","Praise be to Allah.What is siwak?
Siwak means cleaning the mouth and teeth with a siwak which is the name given to the tool used. The siwak is a stick or twig used for this purpose.
Siwak is a method of cleaning the mouth which also earns the pleasure of Allah, as is proven in the hadith of ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, Siwak cleanses the mouth and pleases the Lord. (Reported by al-Bukhari in his Sahih, 2/274, and by  Ahmad, 6/47, and al-Nasai, 1/50. Its isnad is sahih, see al-Irwa 1/105)
Is it sunnah to use the siwak?
Use of the siwak is repeatedly encouraged, as in the hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), who reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Were it not for the fact that I did not want to make things too hard for my ummah, I would have commanded them to use the siwak at every time of prayer. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 2/299 and Muslim, 1/151). According to another report narrated by al-Bukhari, he said: at every time of making wudu.
Imam al-Nawawi reported that the respectable scholars were agreed that use of the siwak is sunnah and is encouraged. One of the signs of its importance is the fact that some of the salaf (early generations of Islam), such as Ishaq ibn Rahawayh, thought that it was obligatory.
Times when use of siwak is recommended
Siwak is recommended at all times of night and day, because of the general sense of the hadith quoted above from ‘Aishah, Siwak cleanses the mouth and pleases the Lord. The scholars have also mentioned situations where use of the siwak is even more strongly encouraged. These include:

When making wudu and at times of prayer.

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Were it not for the fact that I did not want to make things too hard for my ummah, I would have commanded them to use the siwak at every time of prayer. According to another report he said: at every time of making wudu as already stated above.

When entering one's home to be with one’s family.

‘Aishah was asked what the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did when he first came home. She said, When he entered his house, the first thing he would do was to use the siwak. (Reported by Muslim, 1/220)

When getting up from sleep. Hudhayfah ibn al-Yaman (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) got up during the night, he would clean his mouth thoroughly with the siwak. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 1/98 and Muslim, 1/220)


When the smell of one’s mouth changes whether this is because of eating food with a strong odour, or because of not eating or drinking for a long time, etc. Siwak is cleansing for the mouth, which means that it should definitely be used when the mouth needs cleaning.
When going to the mosque . Using siwak is part of the adornment which we are commanded to wear for every prayer, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): O Children of Adam! Take your adornment while praying [al-A'raf 7:31]. It is also important because the angels are present in the mosque, and one is going to meet with other worshippers there.

When reading Quran and joining gatherings in which Allah is remembered (dhikr), because the angels are present on such occasions.

Using siwak when fasting

The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) are agreed that there is nothing wrong with using siwak during the day when one is fasting , but they differed with regard to using it after noon, which some of them disliked (regarded as makruh). The correct view is that it is sunnah for one who is fasting, just as it is for anyone else, because of the general sense of the reports which prove that it is sunnah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not make any exceptions or state any specific time, and a statement that is general in nature should continue to be taken as general unless there is evidence to indicate that it is specific in application. The hadith used as evidence to forbid using siwak after noon is attributed to ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him), who is quoted as saying that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, When you fast, use siwak in the morning but do not use it in the afternoon. (Reported by al-Daraqutni)
This is a weak hadith. Ibn Hajar said, in al-Talkhis al-Habir, 1/62: a weak isnad). There is no proof that this can be attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). With regard to the use of the hadith, the odour that comes from the mouth of the fasting person is better in the sight of Allah than the scent of musk (reported by al-Bukhari, 2/29 and Muslim, 2/806) as evidence, this mouth odour will not be dispelled by use of siwak because it is caused by the stomach being empty, and it could occur early in the day if a person has not eaten suhur. All the scholars are agreed that it is permissible for a fasting person to use siwak early in the day. This shows that use of siwak is encouraged even when fasting, and there is no difference between using it early in the day or later on.
What should be used for siwak (cleaning the mouth)
The scholars are agreed that the best thing for cleaning the mouth is the twigs of the arak tree, because of its good smell, and because it has brush-like fibers which are effective for cleaning food particles etc. from between the teeth, and because of the hadith of ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: I used to gather siwak sticks from the arak tree for the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). (Reported by Ahmad, 3991; its isnad is hasan, see al-Irwa 1/104)
If arak twigs are not available, the scholars recommended using palm-leaf stalks, or twigs of the olive tree. The hadiths that have been narrated concerning this, however, are not sahih.
The correct view is that any kind of sticks that are cleansing and not harmful may be used instead of siwak, if it is not available, to clean the mouth and remove dirt from the teeth. This includes modern toothbrushes which are known to be beneficial in this regard.
Things that may not be used for siwak
The scholars have stated that it is forbidden to use poisonous sticks, things that are not pure and anything that may cause bleeding, illness or any other harm.
Attributes of siwak
The jurists have described the siwak as a stick of medium length and thickness, no thicker than ones little finger, and free of knots. It should not be so wet that it will twist, because then it will not remove dirt, nor should it be so dry that it will hurt the mouth or crack during use. No doubt this is describing the ideal, otherwise the reports do not specify any particular type of siwak. It is permissible to use any kind of siwak that will do the job.
How to use the siwak
The scholars have differed as to whether siwak should be done with the right hand or the left hand. One group, the majority, think that it is better to use the right hand, because of the general meaning of the hadith narrated by ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her), who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) liked to start with the right when putting on his shoes, dismounting (from his camel), when cleaning himself, and in all things. (Agreed upon). (They also say that) siwak is an act of worship and drawing closer to Allah, so it should not be done with the left hand.
Other scholars say that it is better to use the left hand for siwak, because it comes under the heading of removing dirt. This is the well-known opinion of Imam Ahmad’s madhhab, and it is the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, may Allah have mercy on him.
Some scholars have said that when a person is using siwak with the intention of following the sunnah, he should use his right hand, and if he is doing it to remove dirt, he should use his left hand. The fact of the matter is that this issue is open, as there is no definitive evidence or report, and every opinion has a valid point.
The jurists suggested that when using siwak, a person should start on the right, and use a side-to-side motion rather than up-and-down, as the latter may harm the gums. 
Etiquette of using siwak
Among the etiquette of using siwak, they mentioned the following:

That a person should not use the siwak in front of others or in public, because this is impolite.
That the siwak should be washed after use, to get rid of any dirt that may be on it. ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to use siwak, then he would give it to me to wash it. I would use it first, then wash it and give it back to him. (Reported by Abu Dawud, 1/45).
The siwak should be kept in a clean place.

Using one's fingers to clean one's mouth
The scholars differ as to whether it is acceptable to use one's fingers to clean one's mouth when there is nothing else available. The correct view is that using the fingers cannot be considered as a substitute for the sunnah action, because there is no basis in Islam for doing so, and this method does not clean the mouth as a siwak or similar instrument does. Modern methods of cleaning the teeth, like toothbrushes and so on, that remove dirt and make the mouth smell good, are acceptable.
There is nothing wrong with using siwak that is flavoured with mint, lemon and so on, so long as they do not cause any harm. But a person who is fasting should avoid using any flavoured siwak, and should only use natural siwak when he is fasting.
And Allah knows best.

I recognize that you do receive many questions, please accept my sincere thanks for having this site, regardless of whether I receive an answer or not.
May peace be with you...:)",,,"Praise be to Allah.We cannot conceal our joy and pleasure at the intention expressed in your question of embracing the true religion, Islam. The confusion and hesitation that you describe are quite understandable, because when a person has been indulging in forbidden relationships and then wishes to move to a religion of purity and chastity, it is natural to feel that his own nafs (desires) will defeat him and that he will not be able to do what Islam requires of him in the way of purity and chastity. But we will tell you some things here which we hope will help you to overcome any difficulty that you may be fearing and give a true picture of the situation.
When a person follows the true religion, it is expected to have a far-reaching effect on his personality and behaviour, so that it re-forms him and gives him a fresh start and a new direction in life, completely different from the way he was during his jaahiliyyah (days of ignorance before his Islam). This radical change will produce morals and values that were not there before, which will purify his heart and fill him with a sense of chastity, so that the new Muslim looks with revulsion and disgust both at his own former deeds and at the ignorant world of promiscuity, infidelity, nakedness and utter corruption that exists in the society around him. He will come back to the sound nature (fitrah the natural state of man) and purity of heart of which Shaytaan had robbed him during the days when he was a non-Muslim and sinner. This new direction in life is undertaken freely, by choice, and is accompanied by contentment and acceptance stemming from his total submission to the commands and prohibitions of Allah, Who revealed this religion of Islam with all its laws. We have two sources of proof to support what we say here, one from the shareeah (Islamic law)and one from history.
The shari(textual) evidence is to be found in numerous places in the Quran, for example (interpretation of the meanings):
Is he who was dead (without Faith by ignorance and by disbelief) and We gave him life (by knowledge and by faith) and set for him a light (of Belief) whereby he can walk amongst men, like him who is in the darkness (of disbelief, polytheism and hypocrisy) from which he can never come out? [al-Anaam 6:122]
And those who invoke not any other god along with Allah, nor kill such life as Allah has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse and whoever does this shall receive the punishment.
The torment will be doubled to him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace,
Except those who repent and believe, and do righteous deeds, for those, Allah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. [al-Furqaan 25:68-70]
Concerning the phrase Allah will change their sins into good deeds the mufassireen (commentators) said: their evil deeds will be replaced by good deeds. Ali ibn Abi Talhah reported that Ibn Abbaas said: These are the believers, who before they believed did evil deeds, but Allah wanted them to do something else, so He changed their bad deeds into good deeds
Ataa ibn Abi Rabaah said: This is in this world: a man may be doing evil but then Allah replaces it with good. Saeed ibn Jubayr said: Allah changed them from worshippers of idols into worshippers of the Most Merciful, and changed them from those who fight the Muslims into those who fight the (polytheists), and from those who marry mushrik (polytheist)women into those who marry believing women. Al-Hasan al-Basri said: Allah changed them from evil deeds to good deeds, from shirk (polytheism) to ikhlaas (purity of faith), from promiscuity to chastity, from disbelief to Islam. This is the view of Abu Aaliyah, Qutaadah and a group of others.
(Ibn Katheer, Tafseer al-Quran al-Azeem).
The historical evidence includes a number of stories of Muslims who entered Islam after having been (disbelievers), and how they changed and became righteous. Among these stories is the following:
There was a (Muslim) man called Marthad ibn Abi Marthad who used to smuggle Muslim prisoners-of-war from Makkah (which was the territory of the mushrikeen) to Madeenah (which was the territory of the Muslims). There was also a woman in Makkah, called Anaaq, who was a prostitute. She had been a friend of Marthads (before he became Muslim). Marthad had promised to take one of the prisoners from Makkah to Madeenah. He said: I came to the shade of one of the gardens of Makkah on a moonlit night, then Anaaq came and saw my shadow by the garden. When she reached me, she recognized me and said: Marthad? I said, Marthad. She said: Welcome! Stay with us tonight. I said, O Anaaq, Allah has forbidden zinaa (unlawful sexual relations). She called out, O people of the camp! This man is stealing away your prisoners! (i.e., she wanted to take revenge on him because he refused to have unlawful relations with her, so she called the polytheists to come and seize him). Eight men pursued me (and he described how Allah saved him from them). This event was the reason for the revelation of the verse (interpretation of the meaning): Let no man guilty of adultery or fornication marry any but a woman similarly guilty, or an Unbeliever; nor let any but such a man or an Unbeliever marry such a woman; to the Believers such a thing is forbidden. [al-Noor 24:3 Yusuf Alis translation]
(Reported and classed as hasan by al-Tirmidhi, 3101).
The reason for telling this story is that it illustrates how this man changed after he embraced Islam, and refused to commit the haraam deed with which he was tempted. Another story describes a woman who embraced Islam and became righteous:
Abd-Allah ibn Maghfal reported that there was a woman who had been a prostitute during the days of ignorance (before Islam). A man passed by her, or she passed by him, and he touched her. She said: Stop it! (Mah! A word connoting a rebuke or denunciation). Allah has done away with polytheism and had brought Islam. So he left her alone and went away.
(Reported by al-Haakim, who said this hadeeth is saheeh according to the conditions of Muslim, although they did not report it).
If you enter Islam and become a truly practicsing Muslim, adhering to this pure shareeah, worshipping Allah(God willing) as He wants to be worshipped, obeying His commands and heeding His prohibitions, then in sha Allah you will not encounter or suffer the difficulties you refer to in your question. Moreover, you will have the means of keeping chaste, such as marriage, which will help you to refrain from doing unlawful deeds; marriage is enjoined by this shareeah. The one who chooses a pure and clean way has no need to enter the mire (of illicit relationships). We ask Allah to guide you and make things easy for you, and to keep evil away from you.

2587,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2587,Types of Vows in Islam,What are the different types of vows in Islam?,"There are several types of vows: 1- vows which must be fulfilled, 2- vows which it is forbidden to fulfill, 3- vows which require kafarat yamin, and 4- vows which you can either fulfill or expiate by kafarat yamin.","What is a vow?


Do you have to fulfill your vows?


What are the discouraged types of vows?


Why are these types of vows discouraged?


Types of vows and their fulfillment","Praise be to Allah.What is a vow?
Al-Isfahani (may Allah have mercy on him) says, in his book Mufradat Alfaz al-Quran (Vocabulary of the Quran), p. 797:
“Al-Nadhr (vow): when you oblige yourself to do something that is not obligatory because of something that you want to happen. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘[Maryam said:] I have vowed a fast unto the Most Beneficent (Allah)…’ [Maryam 19:26].”
So a vow is the action, on the part of a person who is adult and of sound mind (mukallaf), of obliging himself to do something that is not obligatory , whether he intends to do it straight away or makes his doing it conditional upon something else.
Vows are mentioned in the Quran in approving terms. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, the abrar (pious, who fear Allah and avoid evil), shall drink a cup (of wine) mixed with water from a spring in Paradise called Kafur, a spring wherefrom the slaves of Allah will drink, causing it to gush forth abundantly. They (are those who) fulfill their vows, and they fear a Day whose evil will be wide spreading.” [al-Dahr 76:5-7]. So Allah makes their fear of the horrors of the Day of Resurrection and their fulfillment of their vows some of the reasons for their salvation and admittance to Paradise.
Do you have to fulfill your vows?
Fulfilling legitimate (Shar`i) vows is obligatory according to Shari`ah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Then let them complete the prescribed duties (manasik of Hajj) for them, and perform their vows…” [al-Hajj 22:29]. Imam al-Shawkani said: “This means that they have to do this.”
Numerous hadiths have been reported from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) discouraging vows and describing them as makruh. Abu Hurayrah said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Do not make vows, for vows do not change qadar (the divine decree) in the slightest, but they make the stingy person give something up.’” (Reported by Muslim)
‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) began to discourage us from making vows, and said, ‘They do not change anything, although they may make the miser give up something.’” (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim)
One might ask, how is it that those who fulfill their vows are praised, then making vows is discouraged? The answer is that the kind of vow that is praised is the vow to do acts of worship that are not connected to anything – i.e., not conditional upon anything – which makes a man force himself to do acts of worship and prevent himself from being lazy, or in thanksgiving for some blessing. 
What are the discouraged types of vows?
The kinds of vow which are discouraged are of different types, including vows that are made in return for something, whereby a person makes his doing an act of worship conditional upon attaining something or warding off something, and if that does not happen, he does not do the act of worship. 
Why are these types of vows discouraged?
This is what is discouraged, perhaps for the following reasons:

Because then the person who made the vow would be doing the act of worship reluctantly, because it has become something he cannot avoid or get out of.
Because when the person making the vow makes the act of worship conditional upon his getting what he wants, his vow becomes a kind of exchange or barter which corrupts his intention; if the sick person is not cured, he will not give the charity which he vowed to give if the sick person was healed. This is miserliness, because the miser will not give anything except for something in return in this life (as opposed to the Hereafter), and what he gains is more than what he gives.
Some people ignorantly believe that making a vow guarantees that they will get whatever they made the vow for, or that Allah will make it happen for them because of the vow.
Another ignorant belief is the idea that making a vow can change qada (the divine decree), or that it can bring them some immediate benefit or ward off some harm. So vows were discouraged lest ignorant people believe such things, and as a warning of the danger that such attitudes present to sound belief.

Types of vows and their fulfillment

Vows which must be fulfilled (vows to do acts of worship and obedience to Allah)

This includes every vow which involves a promise to do some kind of act of worship, such as praying, fasting, performing ‘Umrah or Hajj, upholding family ties, doing I’tikaf (retreat for worship in the mosque), jihad, enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil. For example, a person may say, “It is my duty towards Allah to fast such-and-such (days)” or to give such-and-such in charity, or to go for Hajj this year, or to pray two rak`ahs in al-Masjid al-Haram [in Makkah] in thanksgiving to Allah for curing a sick person. Or he may make a vow of doing some act of worship conditional upon something that will benefit him if it happens, so he says, “If my absent loved one returns or Allah protects me from the evil of my enemy, I will fast such-and-such (days) or give such-and-such in charity.”
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever vows to do some act of worship and obedience to Allah, then let him do it, and whoever vows to do some sin, let him not do it.” (Reported by al-Bukhari, 6202)
If a man vows to do some act of worship then circumstances change and prevent him from fulfilling his vow, such as he vows to fast for a month or to go for Hajj or ‘Umrah, then he falls sick and is unable to fast or travel, or he vows to give charity, then he becomes poor and is unable to give what he promised, then in such cases he must offer expiation (kaffarah) for breaking his vow, which is the same as kaffarat yamin (expiation for breaking an oath). Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both) said, “Whoever makes a vow and is then unable to fulfill it, his expiation is kaffarat yamin.” (Reported by Abu Dawud. Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar said in Bulugh al-Maram, Its isnad is sahih, and some huffaz thought it was mawquf.).
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in al-Fatawa (33/49): “If a man intends to vow to do some act of worship and obedience to Allah, then he must fulfill it. If he does not fulfill his vow to Allah, then he must offer kaffarat yamin, according to the majority of the salaf (early generations of Islam).”

Vows which it is forbidden to fulfill, and for which kaffarat yami n must be offered

This includes different types of vows:

Vows to commit sin :

This is every vow which involves disobedience to Allah, such as vows to bring oil, candles or money to graves or shrines (mash-hads), or to visit tombs and shrines of shirk. This is in some ways like making vows to idols. It is also forbidden to fulfill vows which promise to do some sin, like committing zina (adultery, fornication), drinking alcohol, stealing, taking orphans’ property, denying someone’s rights, or cutting family ties by cutting a certain relative off or not entering his house for no shar’i reason. All of these are not permitted at all, and (the person who makes such a vow) must offer kaffarat yamin in expiation for his vow. The evidence (dalil) that it is not permissible to fulfill this kind of vow is the hadith of ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever vows to do some act of worship and obedience to Allah, then let him do it, and whoever vows to do some sin, let him not do it.” (Reported by al-Bukhari). ‘Imran ibn Husayn reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There should be no fulfillment of a vow to commit sin.” (Reported by Muslim, 3099).

Vows that go against a shar’i text (of the Quran or Sunnah)

If a Muslim makes a vow then it becomes clear to him that this vow of his goes against a clear, sahih text that contains some command or prohibition, then he must refrain from fulfilling his vow, and offer kaffarat yamin for it. The evidence for this is the report of al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) from Ziyad ibn Jubayr, who said: “I was with Ibn ‘Umar and a man asked him, ‘I made a vow to fast every Tuesday or Wednesday as long as I live, and it so happens that this day is Yawm al-Nahr (the Day of Sacrifice, i.e., the first day of ‘Eid al-Adha).’ He said, ‘Allah has commanded us to fulfill vows and we are forbidden to fast on Yawm al-Nahr.’ He repeated this to him, and said no more and no less.” (Sahih al-Bukhari, 6212).
Imam Ahmad reported that Ziyad ibn Jubayr said: “A man asked Ibn ‘Umar, whilst he was walking in Mina, ‘I made a vow to fast every Tuesday or Wednesday, and it so happens that this day is Yawm al-Nahr, so what do you think?’ He said, ‘Allah, may He be exalted, has commanded us to fulfill our vows, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade us [or he said: we were forbidden] to fast on Yawm al-Nahr.’ The man thought that he had not heard him properly, so he said, ‘I made a vow to fast every Tuesday or Wednesday, and it so happens that this day is Yawm al-Nahr.’ [Ibn ‘Umar] said, ‘Allah, may He be exalted, has commanded us to fulfill our vows, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade us [or he said: we were forbidden] to fast on Yawm al-Nahr.’ They kept repeating this exchange until they reached the mountain.”
Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar said: “The scholars agree that it is not permitted to fast on Yawm al-Fitr and Yawm al-Nahr, neither as an act of worship nor in fulfillment of a vow.”

Vows concerning which there is no ruling other than kaffarat yamin

There are some vows concerning which there is no ruling other than that the one who makes such a vow must offer kaffarat yamin in expiation for his vow. These include:

Non-specific vows

If a Muslim makes a vow but does not specify what the vow is about, such as saying, “I make a vow if Allah heals this sick person” – but does not specify anything, then he must offer kaffarat yamin. ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Amir reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The expiation for a vow is kaffarat yamin.” (Reported by Muslim). Imam al-Nawawi said: “Malik and many others – indeed the majority – interpreted this as meaning absolute vows, such as saying ‘I vow’ [without being specific].” (Sharh Muslim li’l-Nawawi, 11/104).

Vows concerning things that one does not possess.

If a person makes a vow concerning something that is not his, then he has no option but to offer kaffarat yamin. For example, if he vows to give charity from someone else’s wealth, or to free someone else’s slave, or to give a garden that he does not own to someone. The evidence for this ruling is the hadith of ‘Amr ibn Shu’ayb from his father from his grandfather, who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘The son of Adam cannot make any vow concerning that which is not his, he cannot free (any slave) who is not his, and he cannot divorce any wife who is not his.” (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 1101. He said: The hadith of ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr is a sahih hasan hadith).

Vows where one has the option of fulfilling the vow or of offering kaffarat yamin

There are vows where a person has the option of fulfilling the vow or of offering kaffarat yamin. This kind of vow includes:

Vows made in desperation or in anger:

This means every vow that comes in the form of an oath made to urge for something to be done or to stop something from being done, or to swear that something is true or not true, where the person does not really intend to make a vow to do some act of worship. For example, a man might say in anger, ‘If I ever do such-and-such I have to go for Hajj, or fast for a month, or give one thousand dinars in charity’ or, ‘If I ever speak to So-and-So I have to free a slave, or divorce my wife,’ and so on, then he does the thing he said he would not do, but all he really meant by his words was that he would not do that thing – he had no intention of either doing it or the thing he vowed to do if he did.
In such a case, this person – who made the vow for argument’s sake or to express the urgency of doing or refraining from something – has the choice of either fulfilling the vow, or expiating for it by offering kaffarat yamin, because his vow was essentially an oath (yamin).
Ibn Taymiyah said: “If a vow is made in the form of an oath, such as saying, ‘If I travel with you then I have to go for Hajj, or give all my wealth in charity, or free a slave,’ in the opinion of the Sahabah and the majority of the scholars this is hilf al-nadhr (an oath by vowing), it is not a vow. If he does not do what he promised to do, it is sufficient for him to offer kaffarat yamin.” Elsewhere, he said, “The obligation of vows made in anger or desperation is one of two things, according to the majority: either expiation, or doing the thing promised. If he does not fulfill the vow, he must offer expiation (kaffarah).”

Vows concerning permissible things.

This means every vow that includes permissible things, such as vowing to wear a certain type of clothes, eat special foods, ride a certain animal, enter a certain house, and so on.
Thabit ibn al-Dahhak said: “A man vowed to sacrifice a camel in Bawanah (according to one report: because a male child had been born to him). He came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: ‘I have vowed to sacrifice a camel in Bawanah.’ The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Was there one of the idols of the Jahiliyyah there that people used to worship?’ They said, ‘No.’ He asked, ‘Did they used to celebrate any of their festivals there?’ They said, ‘No.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Then fulfill your vow, for there is no fulfillment of vows that involve disobedience to Allah, or that concern things that the son of Adam does not possess.’” (Reported by Abu Dawud, 2881)
This man had vowed to sacrifice a camel in Bawanah (a place beyond Yanbu') in thanksgiving to Allah, may He be exalted, because He had blessed him with a male child. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) allowed him to fulfill his vow, so he sacrificed a camel in that place.

All the earthquakes and other things which happen and cause harm and injury to people are because of shirk and sins.,"Allah is the All-Wise in all that He legislates and commands


Earthquakes are signs from Allah


What to do at times of earthquakes","Praise be to Allah.Allah is the All-Wise in all that He legislates and commands
Allah is the All-Wise, All-Knowing in all that He wills and decrees, and He is the All-Wise, All-Knowing in all that He legislates and commands. He creates and decrees whatever signs He wills, to frighten His slaves and remind them of their obligations and duties towards Him, and to warn them against associating anything in worship with Him, going against His commands and doing that which He has forbidden. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):

“And We sent not the signs except to warn” [al-Isra 17:59]
“We will show them Our Signs in the universe, and in their own selves, until it becomes manifest to them that this (the Quran) is the truth. Is it not sufficient in regard to your Lord that He is a Witness over all things?” [Fussilat 41:53]
“Say: ‘He has power to send torment on you from above or from under your feet, or to cover you with confusion in party strife, and make you to taste the violence of one another.’” [al-An’am 6:65]

Al-Bukhari narrated in his Sahih from Jabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah (may Allah be pleased with him) that when the verse (interpretation of the meaning) “Say: ‘He has power to send torment on you from above” was revealed, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “A’udhu bi wajhika (I seek refuge in Your Face”; “or from under your feet”, he said, “A’udhu bi wajhika (I seek refuge in Your Face).” (Sahih al-Bukhari, 5/193)
(Abu’l-Shaykh al-Isbahani narrated from Mujahid concerning the Tafsir of this ayah, “Say: ‘He has power to send torment on you from above”: (this means) al-Sayhah (the shout or tumult), stones and strong wind; “or from under your feet”, (means) earthquakes and being swallowed up by the earth.)
Earthquakes are signs from Allah
Undoubtedly the earthquakes that are happening these days are among the signs which Allah uses to frighten His slaves. All the earthquakes and other things which happen and cause harm and injury to people are because of shirk and sins, as Allah says (interpretation of the meanings):

“And whatever of misfortune befalls you, it is because of what your hands have earned. And He pardons much” [al-Shura 42:30]
“Whatever of good reaches you, is from Allah, but whatever of evil befalls you, is from yourself” [al-Nisa 4:79]

And Allah said concerning the nations of the past:

“So We punished each (of them) for his sins, of them were some on whom We sent Hasib (a violent wind with shower of stones) [as on the people of Lut (Lot)], and of them were some who were overtaken by As-Saihah [torment awful cry, (as Thamud or Shu‘ayb’s people)], and of them were some whom We caused the earth to swallow [as Qarun (Korah)], and of them were some whom We drowned [as the people of Nuh (Noah), or Fir‘aun (Pharaoh) and his people]. It was not Allah Who wronged them, but they wronged themselves” [al-‘Ankabut 29:40]

What to do at times of earthquakes
What Muslims and others who are accountable and of sound mind must do is repent to Allah, adhere firmly to His Religion and avoid all that He has forbidden of Shirk and sin, so that they may be safe and attain salvation from all evils in this world and the next, and so that Allah will ward off from them all harm, and bless them with all good. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):

“And if the people of the towns had believed and had the Taqwa (piety), certainly, We should have opened for them blessings from the heaven and the earth, but they belied (the Messengers). So We took them (with punishment) for what they used to earn (polytheism and crimes).” [al-A’raf 7:96]

And Allah says concerning the People of the Book (interpretation of the meaning):

“And if only they had acted according to the Tawrah (Torah), the Injil (Gospel), and what has (now) been sent down to them from their Lord (the Quran), they would surely, have gotten provision from above them and from underneath their feet” [al-Maidah 5:66].

And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):

“Did the people of the towns then feel secure against the coming of Our punishment by night while they were asleep? Or, did the people of the towns then feel secure against the coming of Our punishment in the forenoon while they were playing? Did they then feel secure against the Plan of Allah? None feels secure from the Plan of Allah except the people who are the losers.” [al-A’raf 7:97-99]

Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Allah sometimes gives the earth permission to breathe, which is when major earthquakes happen; this makes people feel scared, so they repent, give up sins, pray to Allah and feel regret [for their sins]. When there had been an earthquake, some of the Salaf said: your Lord is warning you. When Madinah was struck by an earthquake, ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with you) addressed the people and said: if there is another earthquake, I will not stay here with you.”
And there are many similar reports from the Salaf.
Our response when there is an earthquake or some other sign such as an eclipse, strong winds or floods, should be to hasten to repent to Allah and pray to Him for safety, and to remember Him much and seek His forgiveness, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said when there was an eclipse: “If you see anything like that, hasten to remember Him, call on Him and seek His forgiveness.” (Part of an agreed-upon hadith narrated by al-Bukhari (2/30) and Muslim (2/628))
It is also mustahabb (recommended, encouraged) to show compassion to the poor and needy, and to give charity to them, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:
“Show mercy, you will be shown mercy.” (Narrated by Imam Ahmad, 2/165)
“Those who are merciful will be shown mercy by the Most Merciful. Have mercy on those who are on earth, and the One Who is in heaven will show mercy to you.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud (13/285), al-Tirmidhi (6/43)).
“Whoever does not show mercy will not be shown mercy.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari (5/75), Muslim (4/1809))
It was reported that when there was an earthquake , `Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Aziz (may Allah have mercy on him) would write to his governors telling them to give in charity.
One of the things which will help to keep people safe and sound is if the authorities impose an immediate crack-down on the foolish elements in society, forcing them to behave and applying the laws of Shari`ah to them, enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“The believers, men and women, are Awliya (helpers, supporters, friends, protectors) of one another; they enjoin (on the people) Al-Ma‘ruf (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do), and forbid (people) from Al-Munkar (i.e. polytheism and disbelief of all kinds, and all that Islam has forbidden); they perform As-Salah (Iqamat-as-Salah), and give the Zakah, and obey Allah and His Messenger. Allah will have His Mercy on them. Surely, Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise” [al-Tawbah 9:71]
“Verily, Allah will help those who help His (Cause). Truly, Allah is All-Strong, All-Mighty.  Those (Muslim rulers) who, if We give them power in the land, (they) enjoin Iqamat-as-Salah [i.e. to perform the five compulsory congregational Salah (prayers) (the males in mosques)], to pay the Zakah and they enjoin Al-Ma‘ruf (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do), and forbid Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism and all that Islam has forbidden) [i.e. they make the Quran as the law of their country in all the spheres of life]. And with Allah rests the end of (all) matters (of creatures).” [al-Hajj 22:40-41]
“And whosoever fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him.” [al-Talaq 65:2-3]
And there are many verses on this topic.
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever meets the needs of his brother, Allah will meet his needs.” (Agreed upon; al-Bukhaari, 3/98; Muslim, 4/1996)
And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever relieves a believer of some of the distress of this world, Allah will relieve him of some of the distress of the Day of Resurrection. Whoever makes things easier for one who is suffering hardship, Allah will make things easier for him in this world and in the Hereafter. Whoever conceals a Muslim’s faults, Allah will conceal his faults in this world and in the Hereafter. Allah will help a person so long as he helps his brother.” (Narrated by Muslim, 4/2074) And there are many hadiths on this topic.
Allah is the One Whom we ask to reform the affairs of all the Muslims and to bless them with proper understanding of Islam and help them to adhere steadfastly to it and repent to Allah from all their sins. We ask Him to reform all those who are in authority over the Muslims’ affairs and to support the Truth and eradicate falsehood through them, and to help them to rule the people according to the laws of Shari`ah, and to protect them and all the Muslims from misguidance and temptation and the tricks of the Shaytan, for He is Able to do all that.
And Allah knows best.",Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him)
2594,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2594,Some of the Names of    Allah and their meanings,"can you give all the meanings of attributes of allah, including its literal and technical meaning and where it is mentioned in the quran or sunnah",,,"Praise be to Allah.This is a question which needs a very long answer, but we will summarize it as follows:
Firstly, the names of Allah are not limited to any specific number. We know some of them and do not know others, as is indicated by the hadeeth of ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ood (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘There is no one among you who, when he is stricken with distress and grief, says, “Allahumma inni ‘abduka wabnu ‘abdika wabnu amatika naasiyati bi yadika maadin fiyya hukmuka, ‘adlun fiyya qadaa’uka. As’aluka bi kull ismin huwa laka sammayta bihi nafsaka aw allamtahu ahadan min khalqika aw anzaltahu fi kitaabika aw asta’tharta bihi fi ‘ilm il-ghayb ‘indaka an taj’al al-Qur’aana rabee’a qalbi wa noora sadri wa jilaa’a huzni wa dhahaaba hammi [O Allah, I am Your slave, sone of Your slave and son of Your maidservant, my forelock is in Your hand. Your command over me is forever executed and Your decree over me is just. I ask You by every name belonging to You which You named Yourself with, or You taught to any of Your creation, or revealed in Your Book, or You have preserved in the knowledge of the Unseen with You, that You nmake the Qur’aan the life of my heart and the light of my breast, and a departure for my sorrow and a release for my anxiety]” – but Allah will remove his distress and his grief, and will give him joy instead…”
(Reported by Imaam Ahmad, 3582; it is a saheeh hadeeth).
Secondly, The names of Allah are all husnaa [Most Beautiful], as He says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allah, so call on Him by them, and leave the company of those who belie or deny (or utter impious speech against) His Names. They will be requited for what they used to do.” [al-A’raaf 7:180]
The meaning of al-husnaa implies the utmost beauty, and that each name includes the quality of perfection.
Al-‘Allaamah ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Naasir ibn Sa’di (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Many of the names of Allah have been mentioned in the Qur’aan, according to the context, but we also need to point out their broader meanings, so we say:
The name Rabb (Lord, Cherisher) is repeated in many aayaat. The Rabb is the One Who guides and cares for all of His slaves by managing their affairs and bestowing different kinds of blessings. In a more specific sense, He cares for and guides His friends (devoted slaves) by reforming and setting straight their hearts and souls and attitudes. For this reason, many of their du’aa’s or prayers to Him address Him by this glorious Name, because they are asking Him for this specific kind of care.
The name Allah refers to the One Who is adored and worshipped, the One Who possesses the attributes of divinity and to whom all His creation is enslaved. The attributes of divinity with which He describes Himself are the attributes of perfection.
Al-Malik (the Sovereign), al-Maalik (the Possessor), Alladhi lahu’l-Mulk (the One to Whom Dominion belongs). Allah is the One Who is described with the attributes of sovereignty and dominion, which are the qualities of might and pride, subjugation and control. He is the One Who is in absolute control of creation, Who issues commands and Who rewards or punishes. The entire Universe, high and low, belongs to Him. All of them are His servants and slaves, and are utterly dependent on Him.
Al-Waahid (the One), al-Ahad (the Unique). He is the One Who is uniquely and utterly and perfectly One, with no partners in His Uniqueness. His slaves are obliged to believe in His Oneness, in belief and word and deed, by recognizing that He is absolutely perfect and is unique in His oneness, and by directing all kinds of worship to Him Alone.
Al-Samad (The Self-Sufficient Master, Whom all creatures need, He neither eats nor drinks). He is the One to Whom all of creation turns for all of their needs, for He is in and of Himself absolutely perfect, in His Names and Attributes and Deeds.
Al-‘Aleem (the All-Knowing), al-Khabeer (the Aware). He is the One Whose Knowledge encompasses all things, seen and unseen, secret and open, everything that is inevitable or impossible or possible, in heaven and on earth, the past, the present and the future. Nothing whatsoever is hidden from Him.
Al-Hakeem (the Wise). He is the One Who has ultimate wisdom, in His creation and in His commands. He is the One Who created everything well.
“… And who is better in judgement than Allah for a people who have firm Faith.” [al-Maa’idah 5:50 – interpretation of the meaning].
He does not create anything in vain, or legislate anything in jest. He is the One Who has Dominion in this world and the next. His ruling applies in three major spheres, in which none else has any share with Him: He judges between His slaves by means of His Law, His decree and His reward/punishment.
Wisdom: He puts things in their rightful places and gives them their rightful status.
Al-Rahman (the Most Gracious), al-Raheem (the Most Merciful), al-Barr (the Source of Goodness), al-Kareem (the Most Generous), al-Jawaad (the Generous), al-Ra’oof (the Compassionate), al-Wahhaab (the Bestower). These names are all close in meaning, and they all indicate that the Rabb is characterized by mercy, goodness, and generosity. They testify to the vastness of His mercy and other attributes, with which He encompasses all of His creation to the extent that His wisdom decrees, although the greater share is bestowed upon the believers in particular. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“… My Mercy encompasses all things. That (Mercy) I shall ordain for those who are the Muttaqoon (pious)…”
[al-A’raaf 7:156]
Blessings and goodness are all traces of His Mercy and Generosity. The good things of this world and the next are all traces of His Mercy.
Al-Samee’ (the All-Hearing). He hears all voices, in all the different languages, no matter how many and how varied, when they call on Him for their needs.
Al-Baseer (the All-Seeing) Who has insight into all things, not matter how small. He can see a black ant walking across the face of a rock on the darkest night. He can see what is below the seven levels of the earth and what is above the seven heavens. He is the All-Hearing and All-Seeing, Who knows who is deserving of reward or punishment according to His Wisdom.
Al-Hameed (the Praiseworthy), Who is inherently deserving of praise, by His Names, Attributes and deeds. He has the Most Beautiful Names, the most perfect attributes and the most perfect and beautiful deeds. His actions always revolve around munificence and justice.
Al-Majeed (the Most Glorious), al-Kabeer (the Most Great), al-‘Azeem (the Most Great), al-Jaleel (the Sublime One). These Names describe Allah with attributes of glory, pride, greatness and majesty. He is greater than everything, more mighty, more majestic and more exalted. To Him belong glorification and exaltation in the hearts of His close friends and devoted slaves, whose hearts are filled with veneration of His might and humble submission to His glory.
Al-‘Afuw (the Pardoner), al-‘Ghafoor (the Forgiver), al-Ghaffaar (the All-Forgiving), Who has always been and will always be known for His pardon and forgiveness towards His slaves. Everyone is in need of His pardon and forgiveness, as they are in need of His mercy and generosity. He has promised to forgive and pardon whoever follows the appropriate means. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And verily, I am indeed Forgiving to him who repents, believes (in My Oneness, and associates none in worship with Me) and does righteous good deeds, and then remains constant in doing them (till his death).”
[Ta-Ha 20:82]
Al-Tawwaab (the Acceptor of Repentance). He always accepts the repentance of those who repent and forgives the sins of those who commit sin. Allah accepts the repentance of everyone who repents to Him sincerely. He is the One Who forgives those who repent, firstly by helping them to repent and causing their hearts to turn towards Him. After they repent, He turns to them and accepts their repentance, pardoning their sins.
Al-Quddoos (the Holy) and al-Salaam (the One Free from all defects). Allah is far above any attribute of imperfection, and He is above being likened to any of His creation.
“… There is nothing like unto Him…”
[al-Shoora 42:11]
“And there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him.”
[al-Ikhlaas 112:4]
“… Do you know of any who is similar to Him?…”
[Maryam 19:65]
“… Then do not set up rivals unto Allah (in worship)…”
[al-Baqarah 2:22]
The names al-Quddoos and al-Salaam reject the idea that He could be lacking in any way, and they imply that He is absolutely perfect in all aspects, because once the idea of imperfection is rejected, this is proof of total perfection.
Al-‘Aliyy (the Exalted), al-A’laa (the Most High). He is the One Who is completely exalted in all aspects, in His essence, in His status, in His attributes and in His dominion. He is the One Who rose over the Throne and Who dominates all things. In all the attributes of might, pride, glory and beauty that are ascribed to Him, He reaches the ultimate level.
Al-‘Azeez (the Almighty), to whom belong all might and power, the power of strength, the power of dominion, the power of invincibility. None of His creatures can harm Him. He has subjugated all that exists, and the whole of creation is under His control and is subject to His might.
Al-Qawiy (the Most Strong), al-Mateen (the Firm One). The meanings of these Names are similar to the meaning of al-‘Azeez.
Al-Jabbaar (the Compeller). This Names includes the meanings of al-‘Aliyy, al-A’laa and al-Qahhaar.
Al-Ra’oof (the Compassionate) means the One Who consoles broken hearts and supports the weak and those who seek His help and turn to Him.

Al-Mu’min (the Guardian of Faith), Who is praised for His own sake by His perfect attributes, and by the perfection of His majesty and beauty. He sent His Messengers and revealed His Books with signs and proofs, and confirmed His Messengers with signs and proofs, to confirm the truth of the message they brought.
Al-Muhaymin (the Watcher over His creatures) Who is aware of everything that is hidden and concealed, and Whose knowledge encompasses all things.
Al-Qadeer (the Powerful), Whose power is perfect. By His power He created all things that exist, by His power He is controlling all things and by His power He formed them and perfected them. By His power He gives life and death, and will resurrect His slaves to receive their reward or punishment, so that those who have done well will be rewarded with good, and those who have done evil will be punished. When Allah wills a thing, He merely says “Be!” and it is. By His power He controls people’s hearts, and He directs them as He wills.
Al-Lateef (the Most Subtle and Courteous), Whose knowledge encompasses everything that is hidden and concealed. He knows everything that is secret and understands the most subtle things. He is Kind to His believing slaves and takes care of their interests by His benevolence and grace, in many ways that they are not even aware of. This Name also shares the meanings of al-Khabeer and al-Ra’oof.
Al-Haseeb (the One Who takes account). He is the One Who is All-Knowing about His slaves. He is Sufficient for those who put their trust in Him, and He rewards or punishes His slaves for good and evil, according to His wisdom. He knows about all their deeds, major and minor.
Al-Raqeeb (the Watchful). He is the One Who watches what is hidden in people’s hearts. “… He Who takes charge of every person and knows all that he has earned” [al-Ra’d 13:33 – interpretation of the meaning].

Al-Hafeez (the Preserver). He is the One Who protects what He has created and encompasses it with His knowledge. He protects His close friends from falling into sin and destruction, and gently protects them when they are active and when they are at rest. He counts the deeds of His slaves and rewards or punishes them accordingly.
Al-Muheet (the Encompasser). He is the One Who encompasses all things with His knowledge, power, mercy and dominion.
Al-Qahhaar (the Subduer). He is the Subduer of all things, to Whom all of creation submits because of His power and strength and the perfection of His Might.
Al-Muqeet (the Provider of sustenance). He gives provision to everything that exists and directs the affairs of all as He wills.
Al-Wakeel (the Trustee). He is the One Who is in a position to run the affairs of His creation, by His knowledge and the perfection of His power and His encompassing wisdom. He is the One Who is taking care of His close friends, making the right way easy for them and causing them to steer clear of the wrong way. He is taking care of all their affairs, and whoever puts his trust in Him will find that He is Sufficient for him.
“Allah is the Walee (Protector or Guardian) of those who believe. He brings them out from darkness into light…” [al-Baqarah 2:257 – interpretation of the meaning].
Dhoo’l-Jalaali wa’l-Ikraam (Possessor of Majesty and Honour), i.e., the Possessor of Might and Pride, the Possessor of Mercy and Generosity, Who is kind to everyone and to specific individuals. He honours His close friends and devoted worshippers who glorify Him, extol His greatness and love Him.
Al-Wudood (the Loving). He loves His Prophets and Messengers and their followers, and they love Him. He is dearer to them than everything else. He has filled their hearts with love for Him and their tongues utter words of praise to Him. Their hearts are drawn to Him in love and sincerity and they turn in repentance to Him at all times.
Al-Fattaah (the Opener). He judges between His slaves according to His laws, His decrees and His decisions concerning reward and punishment. By His Grace He opens the eyes of those who are sincere, and opens their hearts to know Him, love Him and turn to Him in repentance. He opens the door to all kinds of mercy and provision for His slaves, and generates the causes by means of which they can earn good things in this world and the next.
“Whatever of mercy (i.e., good) Allah may grant to mankind, none can withhold it, and whatever He may withhold, none can grant it thereafter…” Faatir 35:2 – interpretation of the meaning]
Al-Razzaaq (the Provider), Who provides for all His slaves. There is no living creature on earth, but Allah provides for it.
His provision for His slaves is of two types:
General provision, which include the righteous and immoral, the first and the last. This is the provision of physical needs.
Specific provision, which is provision for the heart which is nourished with knowledge and faith, and the halaal provision which helps a person to adhere to religion. This provision is specifically for the believers, and is given to varying degrees according to His wisdom and mercy.
Al-Hakam (the Judge), al-‘Adl (the Just). He judges between His slaves in this world and the next, with His justice and fairness. He does not oppress anyone in the slightest, and no one is made to bear the burden of another person’s sin. He does not punish a person more than he deserves for his sin, he restores to people their rights and does not leave anyone without restoring what is his right. He is just in His running of the universe and in His decision making.
“… Verily, My Lord is on a Straight Path (the truth)…”
[Hood 11:56 – interpretation of the meaning].
Jaami’ al-Naas (Gatherer of the People). He will gather all of mankind on the Day concerning which there is no doubt. He has comprehensive knowledge of their deeds and their provision, and there is nothing, major or minor, that He is not aware of. He will gather every particle of their bodies that has disappeared or been changed into something else, of all the people who have died from the earliest times until the latest times, by the perfection of His power and the vastness of His knowledge.
Al-Hayy (the Ever-Living), al-Qayyoom (the Self-Sustaining). He is completely alive and sustains Himself, and He sustains and cares for the people of heaven and earth. He controls their affairs and provides for them. The name al-Hayy encompasses all the qualities of His essence and the name al-Qayyoom encompasses all the qualities of His deeds.
Al-Noor (the Light). He is the Light of the heavens and of the earth, Who enlightens the hearts of the ‘aarifeen (those who have proper knowledge of Him) with knowledge of Him and fills their hearts with the light of His guidance. He is the One Who illuminates the heavens and the earth with the lights that He has placed therein. His veil is Light and if it were to be removed, everything of His creation as far as He can see would be burnt, may He be glorified.
Badee’ al-Samawaati wa’l-Ard (Originator of the heavens and the earth). He is the One Who created them and formed them with the utmost beauty and with the most magnificent system of organization.
Al-Qaabid (the Constrictor), al-Baasit (the Expander). He is the One Who takes people’s souls, and Who provides them with ample provision and expands their hearts. All of this is in accordance with His Wisdom and Mercy.
Al-Mu’ti (the Giver), al-Maani’ (the Withholder). No-one can withhold what He gives, and no one can give what He withholds. All interests and benefits are sought from Him, and the needs of all are addressed to Him.

Al-Shaheed (the Witness). He is the One Who watches over all things and hears all voices, loud and soft. He sees all that exists, great and small alike. His knowledge encompasses all things, and He is the Witness Who sees all the deeds of His slaves, good and bad alike.
Al-Mubdi’ (the Originator), al-Mu’eed (the Restorer). Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And it is He Who originates the creation, then will repeat (after it has perished)…”
[al-Room 30:27]
He initiated their creation, in order to test them as to which of them would be best in deeds, then He will re-create them in order to reward with good those who did well, and punish those who did evil.
He is the One Who initiated His creation in stages, and Who is constantly renewing it.
Al-Fa’’aal lima yureed (the One Who does whatever He wants). This has to do with the perfection of His power and the strength of His will and ability. Everything He wants, He does, with nothing to stop Him and no one to oppose Him, and with no support or help, no matter what it is. If He wants something, all he has to do is say “Be!” and it is. Although He can do whatever He wants, His will operates in conjunction with His Wisdom, may He be praised, so He is described as being completely Able and being Strong of will, but also as being completely Wise in all that He has done and will do.
Al-Ghaniy (the Self-Sufficient), al-Mughni (the Enricher). He is independent in and of Himself, and is completely Independent in all aspects, because of His perfection and the perfection of His attributes. Nothing can undermine His perfection and make Him imperfect in any way whatsoever. He cannot be anything but Self-Sufficient, because this self-sufficiency is one of His essential qualities, just as He cannot be anything but the Creator, the Able, the Provider, the Kind, Who does not need anyone else at all.
He is the Self-Sufficient in Whose hands are the treasures of the heavens and the earth, the treasures of this world and of the Hereafter. He gives His creation enough in general terms so that they do not have to seek help of anyone else, and He gives to specific people of the divine knowledge and realities of faith with which He has filled their hearts.
Al-Haleem (the Forbearing One). He is the One Who showers His creation with blessings both apparent and hidden, in spite of their sins and many mistakes. He is Forbearing and does not punish sinners straight away for their sins. He rebukes them so that they will repent, and gives them time to turn to Him in repentance.
Al-Shaakir (the Grateful), al-Shakoor (the Appreciative). He is the One Who appreciates the smallest deed, and forgives the greatest mistakes. He multiplies beyond measure the deeds of those who are sincere; He appreciates those who give thanks to Him, and He remembers those who remember Him. Whoever draws near to Him with something of righteous deeds, He draws near to him by more than that.
Al-Qareeb (the Ever-Near), al-Mujeeb (the Responsive). Allah, may He be glorified, is near to everyone, and His nearness is of two types:
His nearness to everyone in a general sense, through His knowledge, watching, awareness and witnessing, which encompass all things.
His nearness in a specific sense, to His slaves, those who ask help of Him and those who love Him. The true nature of this closeness cannot be understood, but its effects may be seen in His kindness towards His slave, and His care, support and help of him. Another of its effects is His response to those who call on Him and His acceptance of the repentance of those who worship Him. He is also the One Who responds in a specific way to those who respond to Him and follow His religion. He also responds to those who are in need and to those who no longer have any hope in any of His creation, and who put their trust in Him, hoping for His pleasure and fearing His wrath.
Al-Kaafi (the Sufficient). He is the One Who gives His slaves all that they need. More specifically, He is Sufficient for the one who believes in Him and puts his trust in Him and asks Him for all that he needs in worldly and spiritual terms.
Al-Awwal (the First), al-Aakhir (the Last); al-Zaahir (the Manifest), al-Baatin (the Hidden). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained this in a clear and comprehensive fashion when he said, addressing his Lord: “You are the First, and there is nothing before You; You are the Last, and there is nothing after You. You are the Manifest and there is nothing above You; You are the Hidden and there is nothing beneath You.”
Al-Waasi’ (the All-Encompassing). His attributes and qualities, and everything that has to do with Him, are all-encompassing in such a way that no one can praise Him as He deserves, but He is as He praised Himself, vast in power, might and dominion, and vast in grace and kindness, and vast in generosity and munificence.
Al-Haadi (the Guide), al-Rasheed (the Guide to the Right Path). He is the One Who guides His slaves and shows them the way to all that will benefit them, and protects them from all that will harm them. He teaches them what they do not know, and guides them to the true guidance which will help them and set them straight. He fills them with taqwa (piety) and causes their hearts to turn to Him, in response to His command.
The name al-Rasheed has a meaning akin to that of al-Hakeem: He is Wise in word and deed, and all His laws are good and wise. His creation testifies to His wisdom.
Al-Haqq (the Truth). He is true in and of Himself and in His attributes. His existence is undeniable, and His attributes are perfect. His existence is one of His essential qualities (He cannot but exist), and nothing else can exist except through Him. He is the One Who has always been and will always be described with attributes of majesty, beauty and perfection. He has always been and will always be known for His Kindness. His words are truth; the meeting with Him is truth; His Messengers are truth; His Books are truth; His religion is the Truth; the worship of Him Alone, with no partners or associates, is the Truth; everything that has to do with Him is truth. Allah is the Truth and whatever else they claim to be divine besides Him is false. Allah is the Most High, the Most Great, as He says (interpretation of the meanings):
“And say: ‘The Truth is from your Lord.’ Then whosoever wills, let him believe, and whosoever wills, let him disbelieve…”
[al-Isra’ 18:29].
“… So, after the truth, what else can there be, save error?…”
[Yoonus 10:32]
“And say: ‘Truth has come and falsehood has vanished. Surely, falsehood is ever bound to vanish.’”[al-Isra’ 17:81]",From Tayseer al-Kareem al-Rahmaan fi Tafseer Kalaam al-Mannaan by Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Sa’di (5/620)
