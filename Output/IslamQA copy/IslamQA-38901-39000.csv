38907,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/38907,Can You Shower/Bathe while Fasting?,Does taking a bath break the fast?,It is permissible to shower while fasting and that does not affect the fast.,,"Praise be to Allah.It is permissible for the fasting person to take a bath , and that does not affect his fast. 
Ibn Qudamah said in al-Mughni, 3/18: 
“There is nothing wrong with a fasting person taking a bath . He quoted as evidence the report narrated by al-Bukhari (1926) and Muslim (1109) from ‘Aishah and Umm Salamah, that Fajr would come and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would be junub (in a state of major ritual impurity) following intimate relations with his wife, and he would do ghusl and fast.” 
Abu Dawud (2365) narrated that one of the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: I saw the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) pouring water over his head when he was fasting, because of thirst or heat. (Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud)
It says in ‘Awn al-Ma'bud: 
“This indicates that it is permissible for the fasting person to seek relief from the heat by pouring water over part or all of his body. This is the view of the majority, and they did not make any distinction between ghusl that is obligatory and that which is recommended or permissible.” 
Al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Chapter on fasting person bathing: Ibn ‘Umar wetted a garment and threw it over himself when he was fasting, and al-Sha’bi entered the hamam (baths) when he was fasting… and al-Hasan said: There is nothing wrong with the fasting person rinsing out his mouth and cooling himself off.” 
Al-Hafiz said: 
The fact that he called his chapter “Chapter on fasting person bathing” shows that it is permissible. Al-Zayn ibn al-Munir said: He called it bathing (ightisal) so as to include that which is Sunnah and obligatory and permissible, as if referring to the weakness of the report narrated from ‘Ali, which says that the fasting person is not allowed to enter the hamam (baths). This report was narrated by ‘Abd al-Razzaq but there is some weakness in its isnad.

38922,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/38922,Can You Pray Tarawih at Home?,"Is it permissible to pray Tarawih at home? Is it permissible to pray it with one's wife, with the husband as the imam?","Praying tarawih prayer in congregation in the mosque is better, but if a man prays tarawih on his own at home, or in congregation with his family, that is permissible.","Is tarawih obligatory?


Can you pray tarawih at home?","Praise be to Allah.Is tarawih obligatory?
Tarawih prayer is Sunnah mu’akkadah (a confirmed Sunnah) which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) encouraged when he said: “Whoever prays at night in Ramadan out of faith and the hope of reward, his previous sins will be forgiven.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 37; Muslim, 759) 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) led his Companions in praying Tarawih for several nights, then he feared that it may be made obligatory for them, so he did not go out to them. Then `Umar united the people under one imam, and it has been prayed in congregation ever since. 
Isma’il ibn Ziyad said: “`Ali passed by the mosques in which there were lamps during the month of Ramadan and said, ‘May Allah illuminate `Umar’s grave for him as he illuminated our mosques for us.” (Narrated by al-Athram, quoted in al-Mughni, 1/457) 
Can you pray tarawih at home?
Al-Bahuti said in Daqaiq Uli al-Nuha, 1/2245: 
It is better to pray Tarawih in the mosque than at home, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) gathered the people to pray Tarawih for three consecutive nights, as was narrated by `Aishah… and he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever prays qiyam with the imam until he leaves, it will be as if he spent the whole night in prayer.” 
Al-Shawkani said in Nayl al-Awtar (3/62): 
“Al-Nawawi said: The scholars agreed that it is mustahabb, but they differed as to whether it is better to pray it alone at home or in congregation in the mosque. Al-Shafi`i and a number of his companions, and Abu Hanifah, Ahmad, some of the Malikis and others said that it is better to pray it in congregation as `Umar ibn al-Khattab and the Companions (may Allah be pleased with him) did and as the Muslims continued to do, because this is one of the manifest rituals. 
So praying it in congregation in the mosque is better, but if a man prays it on his own at home, or in congregation with his family , that is permissible. 
Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmu’, 3/526: 
“Tarawih prayer is Sunnah according to scholarly consensus… it is permissible to pray it alone or in congregation , but which is better? There are two well-known points of view concerning this; the correct view according to the consensus of the Companions is that it is better to pray it in congregation.”

But they differed with regard to the intention. The Hanafis and Hanbalis are of the view that the intention is a condition of the fast being valid. 
The Maalikis and Shaafa’is were of the view that it is a pillar in addition to abstinence. 
Whether the intention is regarded as a pillar or a condition, the fast – like other acts of worship – cannot be regarded as valid without the intention, as well as abstaining from the things that break the fast.

38932,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/38932,When to Start Fasting after Period,"1 – I fasted on the fifth day of my period because I did not see any blood on that day, but I fasted and did not do ghusl. They told me that the fast of this day is invalid, because in our country they say that a girl who is not married has to do ghusl before Maghrib, and a married woman has to do ghusl before Zhuhr. What is the shar’i view on this? And do I have to make up for this day?
 
 2 – If I fasted on the fifth day of my period, and did ghusl, but I saw blood after ‘Isha’ prayer, will this day be counted, or do I have to make up this day?
As I was also told that even if you do not see blood or there is blood, you do not have to fast until after the seventh day of your period, knowing that my period usually finishes on the fifth day.","Each woman should act according to her own cycle. If a woman’s period normally lasts for seven days, and she becomes pure before that, then she should pray and fast, according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions.","Is fasting valid if ghusl for menses is delayed?


When to start fasting after period","Praise be to Allah.Is fasting valid if ghusl for menses is delayed?
There is no basis for what has been said to you. If you become pure [i.e., your period ends ] before dawn on the fifth day, then you must fast, whether you do ghusl or not, because taharah (being pure) is not a condition for the fast to be valid. But you have to do ghusl in order to pray on time, and it is not permissible for you to delay it until before Maghrib. 
Whoever becomes pure before Fajr, her fast is valid. And she has to do ghusl in order to pray Fajr on time. If she delays the prayer until the time is over, then she is committing a grave sin, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Then, there has succeeded them a posterity who have given up As-Salat (the prayers) [i.e. made their Salat (prayers) to be lost, either by not offering them or by not offering them perfectly or by not offering them in their proper fixed times] and have followed lusts. So they will be thrown into Hell.
Except those who repent and believe (in the Oneness of Allah and His Messenger Muhammad), and work righteousness. Such will enter Paradise and they will not be wronged in aught.” [Maryam 19:59-60]
So what you have to do is to repent to Allah for delaying your prayers until the time was over, and resolve not to do that ever again. 
When to start fasting after period
If you became pure on the fifth day and fasted that day, then you saw blood after praying ‘Isha, then your fast is valid. Even if the blood had come a minute after Maghrib, your fast would still be valid. But if you became pure during the fifth day, then that day’s fast is not valid, and you have to make up for that day. 
What was said to you about not becoming pure until after the seventh day is false and has no basis. It is not permissible for anyone to speak of (the rulings of) Allah without knowledge. The menstrual cycle varies from one woman to another. For some women the period lasts for seven days, for some it is five. Each woman should act according to her own cycle. If a woman’s period normally lasts for seven days, and she becomes pure before that, then she should pray and fast, according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked a similar question to yours, and replied: 
“If the menstruating woman becomes pure before dawn, even if it is one minute before, but she is certain that she is pure, and that is during Ramadan, then she must fast, and her fast on that day will be valid and she does not have to make it up, because she fasted when she was pure; and even if she does not do ghusl until after dawn has come, that does not matter. Similarly if a man is junub (in a state of major ritual  impurity) following intercourse or a wet dream, and he eats suhur and does not do ghusl until after dawn has come, his fast is still valid. 
I would also like to take this opportunity to point out another notion that some women have: If a woman’s period comes and she has fasted that day, some women think that if their period comes after iftar (breaking the fast) and before ‘Isha, this invalidates that day’s fast. There is no basis for that, rather even if the period comes a moment after Maghrib, the fast is still valid.” (Fatawa Ramadan, p. 345)

What is the ruling on that?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It seems that you are asking about breaking your fast during the day in Ramadaan, but it also seems from your question that the distance between your city and the city to which you travelled is far, because the journey took you a number of hours. Such a distance is regarded as a journey and it is permissible for the traveller (musaafir) to break his fast in Ramadaan. But you have to make up that day, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number [of days which one did not observe Sawm (fasts) must be made up] from other days”

38934,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/38934,He made a promise to Allaah to give up sin several times but he went back to it,"I made a promise to Allaah that I would not commit a certain sin, but every time I broke my promise to Allaah and committed that sin. But I soon regret what I have done and repent to Allaah, and I pray the two rak’ahs of repentance prayer, repenting separately for each occurrence of sin), and I renew my promise to Allaah not to commit that sin after I finish the prayer of repentance. But because my faith is weak, as days go by I commit that sin again, then I repent again and renew my promise to Allaah again and again, only He knows how many times. 

My question is: 

What do I have to do as a result of my failing to keep my promise every time, after Allaah has blessed me and enabled me to keep away from those evil actions and I have repented to Allaah sincerely?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.We praise Allaah for having enabled you to repent sincerely, and we ask Him to 
    make you steadfast in following His religion.  
With regard to what you asked about: 
Making a promise to Allaah is a kind of vow and an oath (yameen). 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And of them are some who made a covenant with Allaah (saying): ‘If He bestowed on us of His 
    Bounty, we will verily, give Sadaqah (Zakaah and voluntary charity in Allaah’s Cause) and will be certainly among those who are righteous’”
[al-Tawbah 9:75]
Abu Bakr al-Jassaas said in Ahkaam al-Qur’aan (3/208) concerning this verse: 
This indicates that whoever makes a vow to observe an act of worship has to fulfil 
    it, because a promise or covenant is a vow and an obligation. End quote. 
Al-Zuhri (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Whoever makes a promise to Allaah 
    and breaks it, let him give in charity that which Allaah has enjoined in the case of a broken oath. This was quoted in al-Mudawwanah, 
    1/580. And he said: This was the view of Ibn ‘Abbaas, ‘Ata’ ibn Abi Rabaah and Yahya ibn Sa’eed. Ibn Wahb said, narrating from Sufyaan al-Thawri 
    from Firaas from al-Shu’bi: If a person says, “I promise Allaah…” then this is an oath (yameen). End quote. 
Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah] said in al-Ikhtiyaaraat (pp 562-563): 
If a person says, “I promise Allaah that I will perform Hajj this year,” then this 
    is a vow, a promise and an oath (yameen). End quote. 
If the vow serves the purpose of an oath (yameen), which is to oblige oneself or 
    someone else to do a certain thing or not to do a certain thing, then it comes under the ruling on oaths (yameen), and if he does not fulfil it 
    then he must offer the expiation for breaking an oath (kafaarat yameen). 
Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni (13/622): 
When a person makes a vow which serves the purpose of an oath (yameen), which is to oblige 
    oneself or someone else to do a certain thing or not to do a certain thing, and his intention is not to make a vow (nadhr), this comes under the 
    ruling of an oath (yameen). End quote. 
Based on this, you have to offer the expiation for breaking an oath (kafaarat yameen). It is 
    sufficient for you to offer one expiation for all previous transgressions, if the vows all had to do with the same action – which is what appears 
    to be the case from your question. If the vows had to do with different actions then you have to offer one expiation for each action. 
Shaykh al-Islam said in al-Ikhtiyaaraat (pp. 562-563): 
Whoever repeats an oath before offering expiation, the correct view is that if 
    this oath had to do with one action, only one expiation is to be offered; otherwise he must offer two. End quote. 
The expiation for breaking an oath is to set free a slave, or to feed or clothe 
    ten poor persons. Whoever cannot do any of those things should fast for three days, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allaah will not punish you for what is unintentional in your oaths, but He will punish you for 
    your deliberate oaths; for its expiation (a deliberate oath) feed ten Masaakeen (poor persons), on a scale of the average of that with which you 
    feed your own families, or clothe them or manumit a slave. But whosoever cannot afford (that), then he should fast for three days. That is the 
    expiation for the oaths when you have sworn. And protect your oaths (i.e. do not swear much). Thus Allaah makes clear to you His Ayaat (proofs, 
    evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) that you may be grateful”
