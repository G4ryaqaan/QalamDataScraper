36209,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/36209,Her father is refusing to arrange her marriage on the grounds that she has to finish her studies. Is his guardianship waived thereby?,"I am a seventeen year old girl, and I became Muslim a year ago. My father is Muslim and my mother is Christian. My father does not let me wear niqaab and he won’t let me get married until I finish my higher studies. On one occasion I ran away from home and did not return until my father promised in front of the imam of the mosque and in the presence of two witnesses, that I could wear niqaab and get married to someone who is compatible with me. But my father did not fulfil his promise and he is refusing until now to arrange my marriage. Please note also that he prays sometimes and not at other times, and sometimes he drinks alcohol. 

Now my question is: is his guardianship of me waived, because I want to get married and there is someone who wants to propose marriage?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    We congratulate you on your becoming Muslim, and we ask 
    Allaah to increase you in faith, knowledge and piety. 

    Secondly: 

    It is obligatory for a woman to cover her face before 
    non-mahram men, according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions. 
    We have explained the evidence for that in the answer to question no. 
    11774. 

    It is not permissible for a father to prevent his daughter 
    from wearing niqaab. 

    Thirdly: 

    If the father is negligent with regard to prayer and drinks 
    alcohol sometimes, then he is a faasiq (evildoer), and whether he may act as 
    a guardian with regard to marriage is a matter concerning which the fuqaha’ 
    differed. The view of the Shaafa’is and Hanbalis is that it is not valid. 
    The Hanafi fuqaha’ are of the view that the guardianship of a faasiq is 
    valid, and this is the well known view among the Maalikis, but they regard 
    the guardianship of a faasiq as makrooh (disliked). See: Nihaayat 
    al-Muhtaaj (6/738), al-Insaaf (8/73), Haashiyat Ibn ‘Aabideen 
    (3/55), Haashiyat al-Dasooqi (2/230) and Manh al-Jaleel 
    (3/289). 

    Based on the view that his guardianship is not valid, then 
    guardianship passes to the next closest male relative on the father’s side. 
    The most qualified people to arrange a woman’s marriage after her father 
    are: her grandfather, then her son, then her full brother, then a brother 
    through the father, then his sons, then paternal uncles, then their sons, 
    then the father’s paternal uncles, then the ruler (or qaadi – judge). 

    See: al-Mughni (7/346). 

    Fourthly: 

    If a guardian refuses to marry a woman to one who is 
    compatible with her and whose religious commitment and character are good, 
    then he is preventing her marriage, and guardianship passes from him to 
    whoever is closest. 

    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: What is 
    meant by preventing marriage is not allowing a woman to marry one who is 
    compatible with her, if she agrees to that and if each one wants to marry 
    the other. Al-Ma’qil ibn Yasaar said: A sister of mine married a man, then 
    he divorced her. When her ‘iddah was over he came and proposed marriage to 
    her (again), and I said to him: “She married you, was intimate with you and 
    honoured you, then you divorced her, and now you come to propose marriage 
    again! No, by Allaah, she will never go back to you.” He was a man with whom 
    there was nothing wrong, and she wanted to go back to him. Then Allaah 
    revealed these words (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “do not prevent them from marrying”

    [al-Baqarah 2:232] 

    I said: Now I will do it, O Messenger of Allaah. He said: So 
    he married her to him. Narrated by al-Bukhaari. 

    So if she wants to marry a specific person who is compatible, 
    and he wants to marry her to someone else who is also compatible, and 
    refuses to marry her to the one she wants, then he is preventing her 
    marriage. 

    But if she asks to marry someone who is not compatible, then 
    he has the right to prevent her from doing that, and he is not (willfully) 
    preventing her in that case. 

    End quote from al-Mughni (9/373) 

    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    said: When a woman reaches the age of puberty and if a man proposes marriage 
    whose religious commitment, attitude and compatibility she approves of, and 
    her guardian cannot find any fault in him that make him incompatible with 
    her or prove this fault, then the woman’s guardian must accept his request 
    to marry her, and if he refuses to do that, then he should be reminded of 
    the obligation of taking care of the woman under his care. If he insists on 
    refusing after that, then his guardianship is waived and it passes to the 
    next closest male relative on the father’s side. 

    End quote from Fataawa al-Shaykh Muhamamd ibn Ibraaheem 
    (may Allaah have mercy on him), (10/97). 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: If 
    the guardian refuses to arrange the marriage of a woman to a suitor who is 
    compatible in terms of his religious commitment and good character, then 
    guardianship passes to the next closest male relative on the father’s side, 
    then the next closest. If they refuse to arrange her marriage, as usually 
    happens, then guardianship passes to the shar’i judge, and the shar’i judge 
    should arrange the woman’s marriage. If such a case comes to him and he 
    knows that the woman’s guardians refused to arrange her marriage, then he is 
    obliged to arrange her marriage, because he has general guardianship so long 
    as family guardianship was not achieved. 

    The fuqaha’ (may Allaah have mercy on them) mentioned that if 
    the guardian repeatedly refuses compatible suitors, then he becomes a faasiq 
    (evildoer) as a result; he is no longer regarded as being of good character 
    and his guardianship is waived. According to the well known view of Imam 
    Ahmad, he is no longer qualified to lead prayers, and it is not valid for 
    him to lead a group of Muslims in prayer. This is a serious matter. 

    As we have referred to above, some people reject the suitors 
    who come to propose marriage to the women over whom Allaah has given them 
    guardianship, even though they are compatible, but the girl may be too shy 
    to go to the qaadi (judge) to ask him to arrange her marriage. This is 
    something that really happens. But the woman should weigh up the pros and 
    cons, and see which is worse: staying without a husband and letting this 
    guardian who fools about and is careless control her life, then when she 
    grows old and has no desire for marriage, he marries her off, or approaching 
    the qaadi with a request to arrange her marriage, which is her shar’i 
    right. 

    Undoubtedly  the second alternative is preferable, which is 
    going to the qaadi and asking him to arrange her marriage, because she is 
    entitled to that, and because going to the qaadi and having the qaadi 
    arrange her marriage is in the interests of other women as well, because 
    other women will come as she has come, and because her coming to the qaadi 
    is a rebuke to those wrongdoers who do wrong to the women whom Allaah has 
    placed under their guardianship by refusing to marry them to compatible 
    suitors. So this serves three interests: 

    -The woman’s own interests, so 
    that she will not be left without a husband

    -The interests of others, as it 
    will open the door for other women who are waiting for someone to set a 
    precedent for them to follow

    -Preventing these unjust 
    guardians who are controlling the lives of their daughters and other women 
    whom Allaah has placed under their guardianship, on the basis of their whims 
    and wishes.

    It also serves the purpose of establishing the command of the 
    Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) who said: “If 
    there comes to you one with whose religious commitment and character you are 
    pleased, then marry (your female relative under your care) to him, for if 
    you do not do that there will be tribulation in the land and a great deal of 
    corruption.” 

    And it also serves a specific interest, which is making it 
    easy for those men who propose marriage to women, whose are compatible in 
    terms of religious commitment and character. 

    End quote from Fataawa Islamiyyah (3/148). 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen also said: Would that we could reach a 
    level where a woman whose father refuses to marry her to one who is 
    compatible in terms of character and religious commitment would dare to go 
    to the qaadi so that he might say to her father: Arrange her marriage or I 
    will arrange it myself, or a guardian other than you will arrange it, 
    because this (complaining to the qaadi) is the girl’s right if her father 
    prevents her from marrying and this is a shar’i right. Would that we could 
    reach this level, but most girls are prevented by shyness from doing that. 
    End quote from al-Liqa’ al-Shahri. See also the answer to question 
    no. 10196. 

    If you father refuses to arrange your marriage to one whom 
    you like, then he is preventing your marriage, and guardianship passes to 
    the next closest male relative on the father’s side, in the order that we 
    have mentioned above. If they refuse to arrange your marriage, or if there 
    are no relatives, then guardianship passes to the Islamic qaadi (judge), and 
    his place is taken by the Islamic Centre in countries where there are no 
    Islamic qaadis. 

    It is not permissible under any circumstances for you to get 
    married without a guardian, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no marriage except with a guardian.” 
    Narrated by Abu Dawood (2085), al-Tirmidhi (1011) and Ibn Maajah (1881), 
    from the hadeeth of al-Ash’ari; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh 
    al-Tirmidhi. 

    And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said: “Any woman who gets married without the permission of her 
    guardian, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is 
    invalid.” Narrated by Ahmad (24417), Abu Dawood (2083) and al-Tirmidhi 
    (1102); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’ (2709). 

    We ask Allaah to make you steadfast and to guide and forgive 
    your father.

What is the ruling on doing that?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.There are a number of haram things involved in wearing the masbahah around one’s neck: 
1-Imitating the innovators and Sufis; it is not permissible to imitate the people of innovation (bid’ah).
2-It is a kind of showing off, so that it will be said of the person, he is one of the people of dhikr; or it is like showing off, or it opens the door to impugning his honour as it may be said that he is showing off.
3-It may lead to ignorant people imitating him because they think that it is something good, as they may think that there is some reward for wearing the masbahah around one’s neck.
4-It may lead to people believing that this is a form of protection that wards off evil.
5-He may seek blessing from it and believe that it brings good.
6-If there is some adornment on the masbahah, then it is an imitation of women, because they are the ones who wear necklaces around their necks.
7-It may be a means of fame, because people will point at him and his strange appearance.

36244,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/36244,Going out of Mina by day and coming back at night during the days of al-Tashreeq,"I am from Riyadh, and I want to go for Hajj with some friends of mine from Jeddah. During the days of al-Tashreeq in Mina I want to go to Jeddah to rest, then come back to Mina at night to spend most of the night in Mina, between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. 
My question is: is it permissible for me to go to Jeddah every day during the days of al-Tashreeq and come back to Mina at night? How many hours of the night must I spend in Mina so that I will have stayed overnight in Mina?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly:  
The Sunnah is for the pilgrim to stay in Mina throughout the day, following the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who did not leave Mina except to do Tawaaf al-Ifaadah. And he must stay in Mina for most of the night. 
There is no sin on him if he departs from Mina during the day to go to Makkah or elsewhere, especially if that is because there is no place to stay. 
Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: A person moved on from ‘Arafat then he stoned the first Jamarah, then he did tawaaf and saa’i, then he stayed in his place in Makkah until ‘Asr, then he went back to Mina and slaughtered his sacrificial animal. Does he have to do anything for this? 
He replied: 
There is no sin on him for that. Whoever stays in Makkah during the day of Eid or during the days of al-Tashreeq in his house or with his companions, there is no sin on him for that. But it is better to stay in Mina if possible, following the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his companions (may Allah be pleased with them). If it is not easy for him to do that and it is too difficult for him, and he enters Makkah and stays there during the day, then comes back to Mina at night, and stays there overnight, there is nothing wrong with that. End quote from Majmoo’ Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baz (17/365). 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about some of the pilgrims who live in al-Azeeziyyah and stay in their homes during the days of al-Tashreeq. 
He replied: What I think is that those who live in al-Azeeziyyah should not stay in their homes during the day. Undoubtedly it is Sunnah to stay in the tents in Mina, because Hajj is a kind of jihad for the sake of Allah, as the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), when she said: “Is there any jihad for women?” He said: “Yes, a jihad in which there is no fighting: Hajj and ‘Umrah.” So what is prescribed for the pilgrim is to stay in Mina by night and by day. End quote. 
He (may Allah have mercy on him) was also asked: Does going out during the days of al-Tashreeq to places that are close to Makkah, such as Jeddah, affect the Hajj? 
He replied: 
It does not affect the Hajj, but it is better to stay in Mina by night and by day, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did. End quote from Majmoo’ Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (23/241, 242). 
Secondly: 
The guideline on staying in Mina is that the pilgrim should spend more than half the night there. The hours of the night are counted from when the sun sets until when the dawn breaks. 
Based on this, you should work out the time from sunset until dawn, according to the hours in Mina. If you spent six hours in Mina, this is more than half of the night, so you have done what was required. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the length of time that the pilgrim must stay in Makkah during the days of al-Tashreeq? 
He replied: 
The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) said that staying overnight in Mina must be for most of the night. If we assume that the night is ten hours long, then five and a half hours may be spent in Mina and whatever is more than that is Sunnah.
