14212,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14212,Beware of rumours at times of crisis,"There are some writers, especially on the Internet, who spread news without verifying it, which is confusing the Muslims and making them despair, such as the claim that one of the Muslim cities has fallen, or that one of their leaders has been killed, and other reports which lead to despair and weakening of morale… All of that is without any proof or certainty that the news is true… Some of them even write at the end of their articles, “This is what I have heard but I am not sure whether the report is true”!

 What is your advice to these people?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Undoubtedly at times of tribulation there is 
    a lot of propaganda and excitement, hence the role of rumours. 
It is well known that verifying news is 
    required according to sharee’ah, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! If a Faasiq (liar — 
    evil person) comes to you with any news, verify it, lest you should harm people in ignorance, and afterwards you become regretful for what you 
    have done”
[al-Hujuraat 49:6]
The Lawgiver issued a stern warning against 
    passing on all that one hears. It was narrated that Hafs ibn ‘Aasim said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said: “It is enough lying for a man to speak of everything that he hears.” Narrated by Muslim in al-Muqaddimah, 6; Saheeh al-Jaami, 
    4482. 
It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “It is enough sin for a man to speak of everything that he hears.” Al-Silsilah 
    al-Saheehah, 2025. 
Al-Nawawi said: Usually a person hears truth and lies, so if he speaks of everything that he 
    hears, he is lying by telling of things that did not happen, and lying by speaking of something other than the way it happened; and he does not 
    have to do that deliberately (in order to be regarded as telling lies). 
It was narrated that al-Mugheerah ibn Shu’bah 
    said: The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah has forbidden you to disobey your mothers, to bury your daughters 
    alive, to not pay the rights of others and to beg from others. And He dislikes gossip for you, asking too many questions, and wasting money.” 
    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2231. 
Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said: 
With regard to the words ‘and He dislikes 
    gossip [qeela wa qaala – lit. it was said and he said] for you’ al-Muhibb al-Tabari said, there are three points of view as to the meaning of this 
    hadeeth: 
1 – That it indicates that it is makrooh 
    (disliked) to speak too much, because it leads to mistakes. 
2 – That it refers to wanting to pass on what 
    people say and looking for that in order to tell others of it, so that one can say, “So and so said such and such, and Such and such was said…” 
    The prohibition on this is either a rebuke for doing too much of it or it refers to a particular type of talk, which the person spoken of dislikes 
    to have mentioned.  
3 – That it refers to narrating differences 
    of opinion concerning religious matters, such as saying, “This one said such and such and that one said such and such.” The reason why this is 
    disliked is that speaking of such matters may lead to mistakes. This applies especially to those who transmit such views without verifying them, 
    merely imitating those whom they hear without exercising any caution. I say: this is supported by the saheeh hadeeth, “It is enough sin for a man 
    to speak of everything that he hears.” (narrated by Muslim). 
It was narrated that Abu Qalaabah said: Abu 
    Mas’ood said to Abu ‘Abd-Allaah, or Abu ‘Abd-Allaah said to Abu Mas’ood: What did you hear the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) say about saying “they say…”? 
He said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “How bad it is for a man to keep saying, ‘They say…’. ” al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 866. 
Al-‘Azeemabaadi said: This means, it is a bad 
    way to reach one’s objective, by saying, ‘they say…’. Saying ‘they say…’ is akin to conjecture, i.e., the worst habit of a man is to use the 
    phrase ‘they say’ to serve his purposes, so he tells of something, merely repeating what others have said without verifying it, and thus he 
    transmits lies … this was the view of al-Manaawi. 
Hence our righteous forebears were keen to 
    establish proof and were wary of rumours. 
‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: 
    “Beware of fitnah, for a word at the time of fitnah could be as devastating as the sword.” 
History shows us the danger of rumours when 
    they spread among the ummah. There follow some examples of that: 
1 – When the Sahaabah migrated from Makkah to 
    Ethiopia, they were safe, but then a rumour spread that the kuffaar of Quraysh in Makkah had become Muslims, so some of the Sahaabah left Ethiopia 
    and travelled until they reached Makkah, where they found that the report was not true, and they met with persecution at the hands of Quraysh. All 
    of that happened because of rumours. 
2 – During the Battle of Uhud, when Mus’ab 
    ibn ‘Umayr was killed, there was a rumour that it was the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) who had been 
    killed, so the army of Islam withdrew because of a rumour, and some of them fled to Madeenah and some stopped fighting. 
3 – There was the rumour of the slander 
    incident (al-ifk), when the pure and innocent ‘Aa’ishah was accused of immoral conduct, which led to the distress felt by the Messenger of Allaah 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the Muslims with him. All of that was because of rumours. 
So what is the proper shar’i method of 
    dealing with news?
There are ways of dealing with news which we 
    will look at in brief: 
1 – Deliberation  
The Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “Deliberation is from Allaah and haste is from the Shaytaan.” Al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 1795. 
The one who deliberates may meet some of his 
    needs whilst the one who is hasty may slip. 
2 – Verifying news 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! If a Faasiq (liar — 
    evil person) comes to you with any news, verify it, lest you should harm people in ignorance, and afterwards you become regretful for what you 
    have done”
[al-Hujuraat 49:6]
The reason why this verse was revealed: 
The Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) sent al-Waleed ibn ‘Uqbah ibn Abi Mu’eet to Banu al-Mustaliq, to collect the zakaah from them. When news of that reached them 
    they rejoiced, and they came out to meet the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). When al-Waleed heard that they 
    had come out to meet him, he went back to the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said, “O Messenger of 
    Allaah, Banu al-Mustaliq have withheld the zakaah.” 
The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) became very angry at that, and whilst he was thinking of launching a campaign against them, the delegation came 
    to him and said, “O Messenger of Allaah, we were told that your envoy returned after coming only half way, and we were afraid that he came back 
    because he received a message from you saying that you were angry with us. We seek refuge with Allaah from the anger of Allaah and the anger of 
    His Messenger.” 
Then Allaah excused them in His Book and revealed the words (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! If a Faasiq (liar — 
    evil person) comes to you with any news, verify it, lest you should harm people in ignorance, and afterwards you become regretful for what you 
    have done”
[al-Hujuraat 49:6]
See: al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 3085. 
What is meant by verifying is making the 
    effort to find out the truth of the matter, so as to establish whether this can be proven or not. 
Verifying means making certain of the truth 
    of the report and its circumstances. 
Al-Hasan al-Basri said: “The believer 
    reserves judgement until the matter is proven.” 
Finally: we advise everyone to verify matters 
    and not to rush to pass on news until they are sure that it is true, even if the news is good news, because if it becomes apparent that the one 
    who passed it on is mistaken, he will lose credibility before the people… and anyone who bears a grudge towards him will use it against him. May 
    Allaah help us all to do that which He loves and which pleases Him.

14217,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14217,She got her period during Hajj and she cannot stay,A woman came for Hajj and got her period after she entered ihaam. Her mahram had to leave straightaway and she has no one else in Makkah. What is the ruling?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.She should travel with him and remain in ihraam, then she should come back when she has become pure. This applies if she lives in the land of the Two Holy Places, because it is easy to come back and does not involve a great deal of trouble or need a passport etc. But if she is a foreigner and it is difficult for her to come back, then she should tie a piece of cloth over her private part (so that no blood will leak and contaminate the Mosque), and do tawaaf and saa’i, and cut her hair, and end her ‘Umrah on the same journey, because in this case her tawaaf has become necessary, and in cases of necessity things that are ordinarily forbidden are allowed. 
But she does not have to do tawaaf al-wadaa’ (farewell tawaaf), because menstruating women do not have to do the farewell tawaaf, because of the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him), that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told the people that the last thing they should do in Makkah was to circumambulate the Ka’bah, but he exempted menstruating women. 
And when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was told that Safiyyah had done tawaaf al-ifaadah, he said, “Then let her leave (for her Hajj is over).” This indicates that the farewell tawaaf is not obligatory for menstruating women, but tawaaf al-ifaadah is essential.

Delaying prayer because of feeling shy to perform ghusl","Praise be to Allah.Can you fast without ghusl?
The fast of one who has intercourse with his wife at night and wakes up in the morning in a state of janabah (major ritual impurity) is still valid, as is the fast of one who becomes junub in his sleep, whether at night or during the day. 
There is nothing wrong with delaying ghusl until just before dawn. Rather fasting is invalidated by having intercourse during the day in Ramadan, from the onset of true dawn until the sun sets. (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 10/327)
Delaying prayer because of feeling shy to perform ghusl
With regard to your delaying the prayer until the sun had risen, this was wrong of you to do that. What is obligatory is to perform the prayers on time. Feeling too embarrassed to do ghusl is no excuse for delaying the prayer. You have to repent from that and pray for forgiveness.

Yes, it is permissible to offer non-Muslims condolences at times of bereavement, to visit them when they are sick, and to console them when calamity strikes. 
Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “There was a Jewish boy who used to serve the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). He fell sick, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came to visit him. He sat at his head and said, ‘Become Muslim.’ (The boy) looked at his father who was with him, and he (the father) said to him, ‘Obey Abu’l-Qasim ( (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)).’ So he became Muslim. Then the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) left, saying, ‘Praise be to Allah who has saved him from the Fire.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1356) 
Anas reported that a Jew invited the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to eat barley bread and other food, and he accepted the invitation. (Narrated by Ahmad, 13201, with a sahih isnad)
How to offer condolence to non-Muslims
If a Muslim does that, he should do so with the intention of calling them to Islam and softening their hearts towards Islam; he should call them in an appropriate manner and at an appropriate time. 
Whilst consoling non-Muslims, a Muslim should not pray for forgiveness or mercy or Paradise for their dead, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“It is not (proper) for the Prophet and those who believe to ask Allah’s forgiveness for the Mushrikun, even though they are of kin.” [al-Tawbah 9:113]
Rather he should pray for them in a way that is appropriate, encourage them to be patient and steadfast, and remind them that this is the way of Allah with His creation.

14231,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14231,Some of the rulings on apostasy and apostates,"I am happy to have found this website of yours. I was born a Muslim and I learned a lot of Islamic teachings after I reached adolescence. I am trying to understand my religion. 
I have read in some of your answers on the issue of apostasy that the punishment for the apostate is to be put to death. But I have read on another website that the apostate who is to be put to death is the one who wages war on Islam (muhaarib). 
I am more inclined towards the second opinion. 
The reason for that is that I have friends who were born in Muslim families and who have Muslim names, but some of them do not know how to do wudoo’ or how to pray, but they acknowledge the Shahaadatayn. 
Can we regard these people as apostates and thus put them to death?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
The Muslim should not incline more towards one scholarly opinion rather than another just because it is in accordance with his whims and desires or his reasoning. Rather he has to accept the ruling based on evidence from the Qur’aan and Sunnah. It is essential to put the texts and rulings of sharee’ah before all else. 
Secondly: 
Apostasy (riddah) and going out of Islam are things that may be done in the heart, on the tongue or in one's actions. 
Apostasy may take place in the heart, such as disbelieving in Allaah, or believing that there is another creator alongside Allaah, or hating Allaah or His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
Apostasy may take the form of words spoken on the tongue, such as defaming Allaah or the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
Or apostasy may take the form of outward physical actions, such as prostrating to an idol, mistreating the Mus-haf, or not praying.   
The apostate (murtadd) is worse than one who is a kaafir in the first place. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said, refuting the pantheistic belief of the Baatinis: 
It is well known that the kaafir Tatars are better than these (Baatinis), because the latter are apostates from Islam, of the worst type of apostates. The apostate is worse than one who is a kaafir in the first place in many aspects. 
Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 1/193 
Secondly: 
Not every Muslim who falls into kufr is a kaafir and apostate. There are reasons why a Muslim may be excused and not judged to be a kaafir, for example: ignorance, misunderstanding, being forced, and making mistakes. 
With regard to the first, a man may be ignorant of the ruling of Allaah, because he lives far from the Muslim lands, such as one who grows up in the desert or in a kaafir land, or has only recently come to Islam. This may include many of those Muslims who live in societies where ignorance prevails and knowledge is scarce. These are the ones concerning whom the questioner is confused as to whether they are to be judged as kaafirs and executed. 
The second reason is if a person interprets the ruling of Allaah in a manner not intended by the Lawgiver, such as those who blindly follow the people of bid’ah (innovation) in their misinterpretations, such as the Murji’ah, Mu’tazilah, Khawaarij and the like. 
The third reason is if an oppressor overwhelms a Muslim and will not let him go until he makes a blatant statement of kufr out loud in order to ward off the torture, when his heart is at ease with faith. 
The fourth is when words of kufr come to one's lips without meaning it. 
Not everyone who is ignorant about wudoo’ and prayer can be excused, when he sees the Muslims establishing prayer and praying regularly, and he can read and hear the verses on prayer. What is preventing him from praying or from asking about how it is done and what its essential conditions are? 
Fourthly: 
The apostate is not to be put to death immediately after he falls into apostasy, especially if his apostasy happens because of some doubt that arose. Rather he should be asked to repent and he should be offered the opportunity to return to Islam and resolve his doubts, if he has any doubts. Then if he persists in his apostasy after that, he is to be put to death. 
Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni, 9/18: 
The apostate should not be put to death until he has been asked to repent three times. This is the view of the majority of scholars, including ‘Umar, ‘Ali, ‘Ata’, al-Nakhaii, Maalik, al-Thawri, al-Awzaa’i, Ishaaq and others. Because apostasy comes about because of doubt, and cannot be dispelled in an instant. Time should be allowed for the person to rethink the matter, and the best length of time is three days. 
End quote. 
The saheeh Sunnah indicates that it is essential to put the apostate to death. 
Al-Bukhaari (6922) narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever changes his religion, put him to death.” 
Al-Bukhaari (6484) and Muslim (1676) narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible to shed the blood of a Muslim who bears witness that there is no god except Allaah and that I am the Messenger of Allaah, except in one of three cases: a soul for a soul (i.e., in the case of murder); a previously-married person who commits zina; and one who leaves his religion and separates from the main body of the Muslims.” 
The general meaning of these ahaadeeth indicates that it is essential to put the apostate to death whether he is waging war on Islam (muhaarib) or not. 
The view that the apostate who is to be put to death is the one who is waging war on Islam (muhaarib) only is contrary to these ahaadeeth. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said that the reason why he should be put to death is his apostasy, not his waging war against Islam. 
Undoubtedly some kinds of apostasy are more abhorrent than others, and the apostasy of one who wages war against Islam is more abhorrent than that of anyone else. Hence some of the scholars differentiated between them, and said that it is not essential to ask the muhaarib to repent or to accept his repentance; rather he should be put to death even if he repents, whereas the repentance of one who is not a muhaarib should be accepted and he should not be put to death. This is the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him). 
He said: 
Apostasy is of two types: ordinary apostasy and extreme apostasy, for which execution is prescribed. In both cases there is evidence that it is essential to execute the apostate, but the evidence indicating that the sentence of death may be waived if the person repents does not apply to both types of apostasy. Rather the evidence indicates that that is allowed only in the first case – i.e., ordinary apostasy – as will be clear to anyone who studies the evidence that speaks about accepting the repentance of the apostate. In the second type – i.e., extreme apostasy – the obligation to put the apostate to death still stands, and there is no text or scholarly consensus to indicate that the death sentence may be waived. The two cases are quite different and there is no comparison between them. It does not say in the Qur’aan or Sunnah, or according to scholarly consensus, that everyone who apostatizes in word or deed may be spared the death sentence if he repents after he is a captured and tried. Rather the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and scholarly consensus, differentiate between the different kinds of apostates. 
Al-Saarim al-Maslool, 3/696 
Al-Hallaaj was one of the most well known heretics who were put to death without being asked to repent. Al-Qaadi ‘Iyaad said:  
The Maaliki fuqaha’ of Baghdad at the time of al-Muqtadir were unanimously agreed that al-Hallaaj should be killed and crucified because of his claim to divinity and his belief in incarnation, and his saying “I am al-Haqq [God],” even though he outwardly appeared to adhere to sharee’ah, and they did not accept his repentance. 
Al-Shifa bi Ta’reef Huqooq al-Mustafa, 2/1091. 
Based on this, it is clear that what the questioner says about the apostate not being killed unless he is waging war on Islam is mistaken, and the differentiation that we have quoted from Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah may dispel any confusion and make the matter clearer. 
Waging war against Islam is not limited only to fighting with weapons, rather it may be done verbally such as defaming Islam or the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), or attacking the Qur’aan, and so on. Waging verbal war against Islam may be worse than waging war against it with weapons in some cases. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: 
Muhaarabah (waging war against Islam) is of two types: physical and verbal. Waging war verbally against Islam may be worse than waging war physically – as stated above – hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to kill those who waged war against Islam verbally, whilst letting off some of those who waged war against Islam physically. This ruling is to be applied more strictly after the death of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Mischief may be caused by physical action or by words, but the damage caused by words is many times greater than that caused by physical action; and the goodness achieved by words in reforming may be many times greater than that achieved by physical action. It is proven that waging war against Allaah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) verbally is worse and the efforts on earth to undermine religion by verbal means is more effective.

The basic principle regarding acts of worship is tawqeef (i.e., acts of worship are to be based solely on Qur’aan and saheeh Sunnah with no room for personal opinion). No kind of act of worship is prescribed except with daleel (evidence from sharee’ah). Whoever comes up with something that was not prescribed by Allaah or His Messenger has introduced an innovation into the religion of Allaah, and this action of his is to be rejected, because in order for a deed to be acceptable (to Allaah), it must meet two conditions: 
1-It must be sincerely for the sake of Allaah alone. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allaah, and worship none but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him)”[al-Bayyinah 98:5]
2-It should be according to the way of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the message he brought. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And whatsoever the Messenger (Muhammad) gives you, take it; and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it)”[al-Hashr 59:7]
So it is not permissible to innovate any kind of act of worship that was not prescribed by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever does an action that is not in accordance with this matter of ours (Islam) will have it rejected.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2697; Muslim, 1718). 
Al-Tirmidhi narrated from Imaam Ahmad ibn Hanbal from the hadeeth of al-‘Irbaad ibn Saariyah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “I urge you to adhere to my Sunnah and the way of the Rightly-Guided Khaleefahs. Adhere to it and bite onto it with your back teeth (i.e., cling firmly to it). And beware of newly-invented matters, for every newly-invented matter is an innovation and every innovation is a going-astray.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, al-Sunnah, 3991. Al-Albaani said in Saheeh Sunan Abi Dawood, no. 3851, it is saheeh). So the Muslim should not go beyond that which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) brought and prescribed. 
The Sahaabah transmitted the description of the wudoo’ of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and none of them transmitted this (the action mentioned in the question) from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), so we should follow that which he brought. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said concerning the matter of speaking the intention (niyyah) out loud:  
“It is not mustahabb to utter it out loud, because that is an innovation (bid’ah) that was not narrated from the Messenger of Allaah or from his companions, and the Prophet did not command anyone among his ummah to utter the intention out loud; he never taught that to anyone among the Muslims. If that had been prescribed, the Prophet and his companions would not have neglected to convey it, because the intention is something that the Muslims must deal with every day and every night. Rather speaking the intention out loud is indicative of a defect in reason and religious commitment.”(Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, vol. 22, p. 231) 
Elsewhere he said: 
“All the things that people have innovated such as speaking the intention (niyyah) out loud before saying ‘Allaahu akbar’, before reciting the Talbiyah, when purifying themselves and in all acts of worship, are all kinds of innovations which were not prescribed by the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Everything that is innovated in prescribed acts of worship, such as doing extra things that were not prescribed by the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is a form of bid’ah (innovation) because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to do those acts of worship without doing these extra things. So doing them and persisting in doing so is a form of innovation and misguidance.”  
(Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, vol. 22, p. 223) 
With regard to the dhikr which is said before or after wudoo’, please see the answer to question no. 2165 
So the Muslim should give up anything that was not brought by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and keep away from innovations introduced into the religion, because following innovations implies imitating the People of the Book. And the Muslim should strive to learn about his religion so that he will not fall into bid’ah. And Allaah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
14236,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14236,The reason why tayammum is done on just two parts of the body,What is the reason why tayammum (dry ablution in the absence of available water) is done on only two parts of the body?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
The reason why tayammum is only done on two parts of the body (i.e., the face and arms) is that this is quite appropriate, based on analogy and common sense. For placing dust on the head is something that is ordinarily disliked, rather it is customarily done at times of disaster and calamity, and the feet are usually in contact with the dust anyway. But putting dust in the face is an action of humility and veneration of Allah, submission to Him and humbling oneself before Allah, which is one of the most beloved of acts of worship to Him and one of the most beneficial to the person himself. Hence it is mustahabb (liked, encouraged) for the one who is prostrating to get dust on his face for the sake of Allah, and not to protect his face from getting dusty. One of the Sahaabah saw a man prostrating and putting something between his face and the dust, and he said to him: “Get your face dusty.” This meaning does not apply in the case of getting the feet dusty. 
Moreover, this is appropriate by analogy in another sense, which is that tayammum applies to the parts of the body which are washed during wudoo’, but not to the parts which are merely wiped. For the feet may be wiped when one is wearing socks, and the head may be wiped when one is wearing a turban. Since the parts which are usually washed are reduced to wiping (in the case of tayammum), the parts which are wiped are reduced to nothing, because if we were to wipe the latter with dust, that would not be a reduction at all, rather instead of wiping them with water we would just be wiping them with dust. Thus it becomes clear that what sharee’ah tells us is the most fair and the most perfect.  
The tayammum of the one who is in a state of junub (major impurity following sexual activity) is like the tayammum of the one who is in a state of minor impurity. If the one who is in a state of minor impurity is spared the obligation of wiping the head and feet with dust, then it is more appropriate that the one who is in a state of major impurity should be spared the obligation of rubbing his whole body with dust, because that would involve a great deal of hardship, and it goes against the idea of tayammum being a dispensation. It would also reduce the one who is the noblest of Allah’s creation to becoming like the animals who rub their bodies in the dust. That which was brought by sharee’ah cannot be superceded in wisdom and fairness, and to Allah be praise.","A’laam al-Muwaqqi’een, 1/301, 302"
14238,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14238,Why is the hand cut off in the case of stealing but not in the case of (daylight) robbery or seizing by force?,"What is the difference between the thief (saariq, one who breaks in by stealth and steals something that is kept in an appropriate place) and the robber (muntahib, one who takes something by force in front of others)? Why is the hand cut off in the first case and not in the second?",,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          Ibn al-Qayyim said: 
 
          The fact that the hand of the thief (saariq) may 
          be cut off for three dirhams, and not in the case of the opportunist 
          thief (mukhtalis, one who steals when a person is not looking), 
          robber or extortioner (ghaasib, one who seizes something by force) 
          is indicative of the perfect wisdom of sharee’ah. For one cannot take 
          precautions against the thief who breaks into houses and breaches one’s 
          hiding-places and breaks locks; the owner of the goods cannot do any 
          more than that (i.e., hiding them in appropriate places). If it were 
          not prescribed for the hand of the thief to be cut off, then people 
          would steal from one another in this manner and a great deal of harm 
          would be done, and the problem of theft would be grievous indeed. This 
          is unlike the case of the robber and opportunist thief, for the robber 
          is the one who takes things openly in the sight of people, so they may 
          stop him and restore the rights of the one who has been wronged, or 
          they may testify before the judge. And the opportunist thief is the 
          one who takes things when the owner is not paying attention, etc., so 
          there has to be some form of negligence which enables the opportunist 
          to steal, otherwise when one is careful and alert, he cannot take anything. 
          So he is not like a thief (saariq), rather he is more like a 
          betrayer.  
 
          Moreover, the opportunist theif (mukhtalis) does 
          not take things from a place where things of that nature are usually 
          hidden, rather he waits until you are not paying attention, then he 
          takes your things when you put something down for a moment and are not 
          paying attention. This is something against which precautions may be 
          taken in most cases, and he (the opportunist) is like the robber who 
          steals openly. With regard to the one who seizes things by force, the 
          case is more obvious: it is even more apt that his hand should not be 
          cut off, but it is permissible to put a stop to the actions of these 
          people by beating them, making an example out of them as a warning to 
          others, imprisoning them for lengthy periods and punishing them by seizing 
          their property.","Alaam al-Muwaqqieen, 2/48"

          The fact that the hand may be cut off for stealing one-quarter 
          of a dinar but the diyah (compensation) for the hand [in cases of injury 
          etc.] may be 500 dinars serves a great interest, and there is a great 
          deal of wisdom behind this. It serves to take precautions concerning 
          two things, people’s wealth and people’s limbs. Cutting off the hand 
          in the case of theft of a quarter of a dinar is to protect people’s 
          wealth. Making the diyah for injury to the hand 500 dinars is to protect 
          and preserve people’s limbs. One of the heretics raised this question 
          and mentioned it in two verses of poetry, saying: 
 
          “A hand receives five hundred dinars’ compensation, so 
          why can it be chopped off for one-quarter of a dinar?
 
          This is a contradiction we can only keep quiet about, 
          and we seek the protection of our Lord from disgrace.” 
 
          One of the fuqahaa’ answered him by saying that the hand 
          is precious so long as it is honest, but when it becomes dishonest it 
          becomes worthless. And the poet mentioned it by saying: 
 
          “A hand receives five hundred dinars’ compensation, so 
          why can it be chopped off for one-quarter of a dinar?
 
          Protection against physical aggression makes the hand 
          precious, but the hand becomes worthless when it becomes dishonest.” 
 
          And it was narrated that al-Shaafa’i responded by saying 
          in verse: 
 
          “There is aggression against the hand, therefore it is 
          precious, but here the hand is the wrongdoer, so it becomes insignificant

‘Say: “O ‘Ibaadi (My slaves) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allaah, verily, Allaah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful.

Can women lead prayer?","Praise be to Allah.Can women give Adhan and Iqamah?
It is not prescribed for women to recite the adhan and iqamah as it is for men. If a woman does recite the adhan and iqamah, it may be one of the three following scenarios:

She recites the adhan and iqamah for a group of men only, or for a mixed group of men and women. This is not prescribed in Islam and her adhan and iqamah for a group of men do not count
She recites them for a group of women only.
Or she recites them for herself when she is alone. 

It is permissible for her to recite the adhan for a group of women or for herself, but it is not like the case with men. For men it is  more emphatically required, whereas for women, if they give the adhan it is permissible, and if they do not, it is also permissible.
If a woman does recite the adhan, she must keep her voice low and make it just loud enough for her companions to hear. 
If a woman says the iqamah for herself or for a group of women, that is better and is closer to what is mustahabb, but if she does not do that, the prayer is still valid.
Can women lead prayer?
With regard to a woman leading the prayers and acting as an imam, one of the two following scenarios may apply:

A woman leading men, or a mixed group of men and women. It is not correct for a woman to lead men in prayers at all , regardless of whether it is an obligatory prayer or a nafl (supererogatory) prayer.
A woman leading women in prayer . It is mustahabb for women to pray together in congregation when they get together in a place. One of them should lead the others, but she should stand with them in the middle of the row . It is permissible and correct for a woman to lead other women in prayer.

Allah has commanded us to obey the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“And obey Allah and the Messenger (Muhammad), and beware (of evil) and fear Allah. Then if you turn away, you should know that it is Our Messenger’s duty to convey (the Message) in the clearest way.” [Al-Ma'idah 5:92]

Allah has told us that obedience to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is obedience to Allah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“He who obeys the Messenger (Muhammad), has indeed obeyed Allah, but he who turns away, then we have not sent you (O Muhammad) as a watcher over them.” [An-Nisa’ 4:80] 

Allah has warned us against failing to obey him, and that this may lead a Muslim into a trial that is the trial of Shirk (associating partners with Allah). Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Do not make [your] calling of the Messenger among yourselves as the call of one of you to another. Already Allāh knows those of you who slip away, concealed by others. So let those who dissent from his [i.e., the Prophet's] order [way or sunnah] beware , lest fitnah [trials or affliction] strike them or a painful punishment..” [An-Nur 24:63]   

Allah has told us that the status of Prophethood which He gave to His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) requires the believers to respect and venerate the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, We have sent you (O Muhammad) as a witness, as a bearer of glad tidings, and as a warner. In order that you (O mankind) may believe in Allah and His Messenger, and that you assist and honour him, and (that you) glorify (Allah’s) praises morning and afternoon.” [Al-Fath 48:8-9] 

The Muslim’s faith cannot be complete unless he loves the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and until the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is dearer to him than his father, his son, his own self and all the people. It was narrated that Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No one of you will truly believe until I am dearer to him than his father, his son, his own self and all the people.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 15; Muslim, 44). 

`Abdullah ibn Hisham (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “We were with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he was holding the hand of `Umar ibn Al-Khattab. `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said to him: “O Messenger of Allah, you are dearer to me than everything except my own self.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No, by the One in Whose hand is my soul, (you will not have complete faith) not until I am dearer to you than your own self.” `Umar said to him: “Now, by Allah, you are dearer to me than my own self.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Now (you are a true believer), O `Umar.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 6257) 
Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“The reason why it is obligatory to love the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and venerate him more than any other person is that we cannot attain what is good in this world and in the Hereafter except through the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), by believing in him and following him. That is because no one can be saved from the punishment of Allah, and the mercy of Allah cannot reach him except by means of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), by believing in him, loving him, being loyal to him and following him. This is the means by which Allah will save him from punishment in this world and in the Hereafter. This is the means by which he will attain what is good in this world and in the Hereafter. The greatest blessing is the blessing of faith, which can only be attained through him, and which is more beneficial (to the person) than his own self and his wealth. He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the one by means of whom Allah brings people forth from darkness into light, and there is no other way to Allah. As for a person’s self and family, they will not avail him anything before Allah…” (Majmu’ Al-Fatawa, 27/246) 
One of the scholars said:
“If a person thinks of the benefits that he has been given through the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), through whom Allah brought him forth from the darkness of disbelief into the light of faith, he will realise that he is the cause of his soul will remain forever in eternal bliss, and he will understand that this benefit is greater than all others. So he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) deserves that his share of a person’s love should be greater than anyone else’s. However, people vary with regard to that, depending on the extent to which they bear that in mind or neglect it. Everyone who truly believes in the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) will inevitably have a strong love for him , but they differ in the extent and depth of their love for him. Some of them have a great deal of love for him and some have only a little, like those who are absorbed in their own whims and desires most of the time. But when mention of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is made, most of them long to see him, and prefer that over their own family, sons, wealth and fathers. But that feeling quickly fades because of other distractions. And Allah is the One Whose help we seek.”  (See Fath Al-Bari, 1/59) 
This is what is referred to in the verse where Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The Prophet is closer to the believers than their own selves.” [Al-Ahzab 33:6]
Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“[Allah] knew how compassionate His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was towards his Ummah, and how sincere he was towards them, so He made him closer to them than their own selves, and decreed that his judgement among them should take precedence over their own preferences.” (Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 6/380) 
Shaykh Ibn Sa’di (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Allah tells the believers something by which they may understand the position and status of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), so that they might interact with him appropriately. So He said: “The Prophet is closer to the believers than their own selves”, the closest thing to a person and the most deserving of love is his own self. Yet, the Messenger is closer to him than his own self, because he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was so kind and sincere and compassionate towards the believers. He was the kindest and most merciful of mankind. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did the greatest of favours to all of mankind. Not the slightest good came to them and not the slightest harm was warded off from them except through him. Hence if there is a conflict between what a person himself wants or what other people want, and what the Messenger wants, then what the Messenger wants must take precedence. What the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) says cannot be overridden by what any person says, no matter who he is. They should sacrifice their selves, their wealth and their children, and put love for him before their love for all others.” 
What the scholars have said may be summed up by noting that the wrath of Allah and the Fire of Hell are the things that we fear the most, and we cannot be saved from them except through the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The pleasure of Allah and the garden of Paradise are the things that we want the most, but we cannot attain them except through the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) referred to the former (i.e., being saved from Hell) when he said: “The likeness of me and you is that of a man who lit a fire and grasshoppers and moths started falling into it, and he tried to push them away. I am seizing your waistbands and trying to pull you away from the Fire but you are trying to get away from me.” (Muslim, 2285, from the Hadith of Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him); a similar Hadith was narrated by Al-Bukhari, 3427 from the Hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him)). 
What is meant by this Hadith is that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) likened the way in which the ignorant and disobedient rush to fall into the Fire of the Hereafter by means of their sins and following their whims and desires, and their keenness to fall into that Fire, even though he is trying hard to prevent them from doing so, to the way in which moths and other insects are fatally attracted to the fire. Both of them are keen to destroy themselves because of their ignorance of the consequences. (Sharh Muslim by An-Nawawi) 
The latter (i.e., entering Paradise) was referred to by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he said: “All of my Ummah will enter Paradise except those who refuse.” They said: “O Messenger of Allah, who would refuse?” He said: “Whoever obeys me will enter Paradise and whoever disobeys me has refused.” (Al-Bukhari, 7280, from the Hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him))",Islam Q&A
14253,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14253,Why do we yawn in Ramadaan when the devils have been chained up? And is the transmission of television pictures haraam?,"It is well known that the devils are chained up in Ramadaan and that yawning comes from the Shaytaan, so why do we yawn in Ramadaan? 

And it is known that making images of human beings is haraam, so is the transmission of television pictures regarded as haraam?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Al-Bukhaari (6226) and Muslim (2994) narrated from Abu 
    Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah likes sneezing and dislikes 
    yawning, so if one of you sneezes and praises Allaah (by saying Al-hamdu 
    Lillaah), it is a duty upon every Muslim who hears him to say to him, 
    Yarhamuk Allaah (may Allaah have mercy on you). With regard to yawning, 
    it is from the Shaytaan so if one of you feels like yawning, let him 
    suppress it as much as he can, for if one of you yawns the Shaytaan laughs 
    at him. 
Concerning the meaning of 
    that, it was said that the Shaytaan likes to see a person yawning because it 
    makes him look different and so he laughs at him. It does not mean that the 
    Shaytaan is the one who makes him yawn. And it was said that yawning is 
    attributed to the Shaytaan because yawning comes from fullness of the 
    stomach, which generates laziness, which happens under the influence of the 
    Shaytaan. Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Yawning is 
    attributed to the Shaytaan because it promotes whims and desires, because it 
    stems from heaviness of the body, excessive relaxation and fullness of the 
    stomach. So what is meant is a warning against the thing that leads to that, 
    which is eating too much.  

    Al-Manaawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: It is 
    attributed to him because he is the one who calls for giving the self its 
    share of desires. What is meant here is to warn against the things that lead 
    to that, which is eating too much and eating one's fill, which makes the 
    body feel too heavy and tired to do acts of worship.  

    There should be no confusion stemming from the fact that 
    people yawn during Ramadaan even though the devils are chained up at that 
    time, because what is meant by saying that it is from the Shaytaan is that 
    he likes it. The fact that he likes it and approves of it does not mean that 
    he is not chained, rather that could happen even if he was chained. 

    Based on the view that this is caused by the influence of the 
    Shaytaan, either directly or indirectly, it was said that the ones who are 
    chained up during Ramadaan are the maarids among the devils (i.e., the 
    strong evil ones) only, and that others remain as they are, so yawning may 
    be caused by those who are not chained up. 

    But based on the view that what is meant by the chaining up 
    of the devils is that their influence on the believers is less during that 
    month than in other months, perhaps yawning results from the little 
    influence that they are still able to have during Ramadaan.

    Ramadaan please see question no. 39736. See question no.

14258,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14258,Conditions of Acceptability of Deeds by Allah,"When a Muslim does an action, what conditions make it acceptable and therefore rewarded by Allah.  Is it simply that you intended to follow the Quran and Sunnah, and therefore you will be rewarded even though you may have been wrong in your action.  Or is it that you must have the intention, but you also need to follow the correct Sunnah as well?",,,"Praise be to Allah.For acts of worship to be acceptable to Allah and for a person to be rewarded for them, there are two conditions which must be met: 
The first condition: the  act of worship should be devoted to Allah Alone. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allah, and worship none but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him).”
[al-Bayyinah 98:5] 
The meaning of worshipping Allah alone is that the person should intend in all his words and deeds, both inward and outward, to seek the Face of Allah (i.e., His pleasure). Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And who has (in mind) no favour from anyone to be paid back,
Except to seek the Countenance of his Lord, the Most High.”
[al-Layl 92:19] 
“(Saying): “We feed you seeking Allah’s Countenance only. We wish for no reward, nor thanks from you.”
[al-Insan 76:9] 
“Whosoever desires (by his deeds) the reward of the Hereafter, We give him increase in his reward, and whosoever desires the reward of this world (by his deeds), We give him thereof (what is decreed for him), and he has no portion in the Hereafter.”
[al-Shoora 42:20] 
“Whosoever desires the life of the world and its glitter, to them We shall pay in full (the wages of) their deeds therein, and they will have no diminution therein.
They are those for whom there is nothing in the Hereafter but Fire, and vain are the deeds they did therein. And of no effect is that which they used to do.”
[Hood 11:15-16] 
It was narrated that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say:
‘The reward of deeds depends upon the intentions and every person will get the reward according to what he has intended. So whoever emigrated for worldly benefits or to marry a woman, his emigration was for what he emigrated for.’”
(Narrated by al-Bukhari, Bad’ al-Wahy, 1). 
It was narrated by Muslim from Abu Hurayrah  (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, says: ‘I am so self-sufficient that I am in no need of having an associate. Thus he who does an action for someone else’s sake as well as Mine will have that action renounced by Me to him whom he associated with Me.’” (Narrated by Muslim, al-Zuhd wa’l-Raqaiq, 5300) 
The second condition is that the action should be in accordance with the only way which Allah has prescribed for worship, which is by following the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)  in the laws that he has brought. It was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does any action that is not in accordance with this matter of ours (i.e., Islam), will have it rejected.” (Narrated by Muslim, al-Aqdiyyah, 3243). 
Ibn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “This hadeeth (narration) forms one of the most  important principles of Islam. It is like a scale for weighing up deeds according to their outward appearance, just as the hadeeth ‘The reward of deeds depends upon the intentions’ is the means of weighing up the inner nature of deeds. Just as every action which is not intended for the sake of Allah brings no reward to the one who does it, so too every deed which is not in accordance with the command of Allah and His Messenger will also be rejected and thrown back at the one who does it. Everyone who innovates in Islam something for which Allah and His Messenger have not granted permission, that thing has nothing to do with Islam. 
(Jami’ al-‘Uloom wa’l-Hikam, part 1, p.176) 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoined following his Sunnah (ways) and teachings, and made them binding. He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “You have to follow my Sunnah (way) and the way of my rightly-guided successors (al-khulafa’ al-rashidoon); bite onto it with your eyeteeth (i.e., cling firmly to it).” And he warned against bid’ah (innovation), as he said: “Beware of newly-invented matters, for every newly-invented matter is a going astray.” (narrated by al-Tirmidhi, al-‘Ilm, 2600; classed as saheeh/authentic by al-Albani in Saheeh Sunan al-Tirmidhi, no. 2157) 
Ibn al-Qayyim said: “Allah has made devotion of worship to Him alone and following the Sunnah the means of deeds being accepted; if these conditions are not met, then deeds are unacceptable.” 
(al-Rooh, 1/135) 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Who has created death and life that He may test you which of you is best in deed.”
[al-Mulk 67:2]

If a child shows some

This varies from one boy to

    -He compares the way women look

    -He stares at women for a long

    akin to death and sleep is referred to as mawt (“death”) in the Qur’aan and Sunnah. 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“It is Allaah Who takes away the souls at the time of their death, and those 
    that die not during their sleep. He keeps those (souls) for which He has ordained death and sends the rest for a term appointed. Verily, in this 
    are signs for a people who think deeply”
[al-Zumar 39:42]
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: 
Here Allaah explains that the taking away of souls is of two types: 
He takes them away at the time of death, and He takes away the souls that did not 
    die in their sleep. Then when they sleep, he keeps the soul of the one who dies in his sleep and He sends back the soul of the one who did not die 
    in his sleep. Hence when the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) went to bed, he would say, “Bismika Rabbiy wada’tu janbi 
    wa bika arfa’uhu fa in amsakta nafsi farhamha wa in arsaltaha fahfazha bima tahfazu bihi ‘ibaadaka al-saaliheen (In Your name my Lord I lie

    be your return. Then He will inform you of that which you used to do”

It was narrated that Hudhayfah ibn al-Yamaan said: When the Prophet  (peace

    he would say: “Al-hamdu Lillaah alladhi ahyaana ba’da ma amaatana wa ilayh il-nushoor (Praise be to Allaah Who has given us life after 
    taking it from us and unto Him is the resurrection).” 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5953 
This was also narrated by Muslim from the hadeeth of al-Bara’ ibn ‘Aazib (may 
    Allaah be pleased with him). 
Al-Nawawi said: 
What is meant by amaatana (taking [life] away from us) is sleep. 
    Al-nushoor (the resurrection) refers to the resurrection on the Day of Resurrection. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) pointed out that waking up after sleep which is like death is an affirmation of the resurrection after death. The scholars said: The wisdom 
    behind saying the du’aa’ when wanting to sleep is so that a person’s final deed will be this du’aa’, and the wisdom behind saying the du’aa’ when 
    waking up is so that the first of his actions will be remembrance of Tawheed and good words.  
Sharh Muslim, 17/35 
Based on this, it is not possible for a sleeper to know that he is dreaming, because when he 
    is asleep he is not aware in the way that he is when he is awake, so the rulings that apply when he is awake do not apply to him when he is 
    asleep. Hence the sleeper is excused for not doing obligatory duties as the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “Whoever forgets a prayer or sleeps and misses it, his expiation is to offer the prayer as soon as he remembers.”

Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said:

          is known as the issue of “correcting the imaam”.   
Correcting 
          the imaam is divided into two categories:  
That which is obligatory, which is correcting the 
          imaam concerning something which would invalidate the prayer if done 
          deliberately. If he makes a grammatical mistake which changes the meaning 
          of al-Faatihah, then he must be corrected, because this type of mistake 
          which changes the meaning of  al-Faatihah invalidates the prayer. 
          Similarly, if he omits a verse of al-Faatihah, he must be corrected, 
          because that invalidates the prayer. The kind of correction which is 
          mustahabb (recommended) is when the imaam makes a mistake which does 
          not invalidate the prayer altogether, but it does undermine the perfection 
          of the prayer. So if the imaam forgets to recite another soorah after 
          al-Faatihah, alerting him to this fact is sunnah.
The 
          evidence for that is the words of the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “I am a human being like 
          you, I forget as you forget. If I forget, then remind me.” (narrated 
          by al-Bukhaari, al-Salaah, 401). So he commanded them to remind 
          him. On one occasion when he became hesitant in his recitation, he said 
          to Ubayy ibn Ka’b, “What stopped you?”, i.e., what stopped you from 
          correcting me? This indicates that correcting the imaam is something 
          that is essential.

It is not prescribed in Islam, and the fact that it is not prescribed is supported by the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Do not make your houses into graveyards, for the Shaytaan flees from a house in which Soorat al-Baqarah is recited.” This was narrated by Muslim and al-Tirmidhi from the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah. This indicates that graves are not the place for reading Quran, hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) encouraged reading Quran in our houses and told us not to make them like graveyards where it is not read. Another hadeeth indicates that they (graveyards) are not the place for prayer (salaah) either. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Pray in your houses and do not make them like graves.” This was narrated by Muslim and others from Ibn ‘Umar. A similar report was narrated by al-Bukhari, who included it in a chapter entitled Baab Karaahat al-Salaah fi’l-Maqaabir (Chapter on it being disliked to pray in graveyards); thus he indicated that the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Umar could be understood to mean that it is makrooh to pray in graveyards. Similarly the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah may be understood to mean that it is makrooh to read Quran in graveyards. There is no difference between praying and reading Quran in this regard.  Abu Dawood said in his Masaa’il (p. 158): “I heard Ahmad being asked about reading Quran at the graveside. He said, ‘No [that should not be done].’” 
It is not prescribed in Islam to put “aas” leaves (a kind of tree) or fragrant herbs or roses on the grave, because this is not what the salaf did, and if it was good, they would have done it before us. Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: “Every bid’ah (innovation) is a going astray, even if the people think it is good.” (Narrated by Ibn Battah in al-Ibaanah ‘an Usool al-Diyaanah, 2/112; al-Laakaa’i in al-Sunnah, 1/21, a mawqoof report with a saheeh isnaad).

Making du’a when visiting the grave


Etiquette of visiting graves","Praise be to Allah.The purpose of visiting the graves
It is prescribed to visit graves in order to learn a lesson from that and to remember the Hereafter. That is subject to the condition that one does not say anything that will anger the Lord, such as calling upon the one who is buried or seeking his help instead of Allah, or praising him and saying that he is for certain in Paradise, etc. 
The purpose of visiting the graves is twofold:

The visitor benefits from remembering death and the dead, remembering that their destiny will be either Paradise or Hell. This is the primary purpose of the visit.
The deceased also benefits and is treated kindly by the visitor greeting him with salams , making du’a for him, praying for forgiveness for him. This applies only to Muslims.

Making du’a when visiting the grave
Among the du’as that may be recited are: 
“Assalamu ‘alaykum ahl al-diyar min al-muminin wa’l-Muslimin, wa inna in sha Allah bikum lahiqun, as alu Allaha lana wa lakum al-‘afiyah (peace be upon you O people of the dwellings, believers and Muslims, In sha Allah we will join you, I ask Allah to keep us and you safe and sound).” 
It is permissible to raise the hands when reciting this du’a, because of the hadith of ‘Aishah who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went out one night, and I sent Barirah to follow him and see where he went. She said, ‘He went towards Baqi’ al-Gharqad [the graveyard in Madinah], and he stood at the bottom of al-Baqi’ and raised his hands, then he went away.’ Barirah came back to me and told me, and when morning came I asked him about it. I said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, where did you go out to last night? He said, ‘I was sent to the people of al-Baqi’, to pray for them.’”
Etiquette of visiting graves
But you should not face the grave when making du’a for them; rather you should face the direction of the Ka’bah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade prayer (salah) facing graves, and du’a is the heart and soul of salah, as is well known, and is subject to the same rulings.
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Du’a is worship” then he recited the ayah (interpretation of the meaning): “And your Lord said: “Invoke Me [i.e. believe in My Oneness (Islamic Monotheism) and ask Me for anything] I will respond to your (invocation).” [Ghafir 40:60]

You should not walk between the graves of the Muslims wearing your shoes . It was narrated that ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Amir (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘If I were to walk on hot coals or on a sword, or if I were to mend my shoes using my feet, that would be better for me than if I were to walk on the grave of a Muslim. And it makes no difference to me if I were to relieve myself in the midst of the graves or in the middle of the market-place [i.e., both are equally bad].’” (Narrated by Ibn Majah, 1567)

“But whosoever repents after his crime and does righteous good deeds (by obeying Allah), then verily, Allah will pardon him (accept his repentance). Verily, Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful [al-Maidah 5:39 – interpretation of the meaning]  
Allah is Forgiving and Generous. He commands all His slaves to repent sincerely so that they may gain the mercy of Allah and His Paradise. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):  
“O you who believe! Turn to Allah with sincere repentance! It may be that your Lord will expiate from you your sins, and admit you into Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise)” [al-Tahrim 66:8]  
The door of repentance is always open
The gate of repentance is open to His slaves, until the sun rises from the west. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah spreads out His Hand at night to accept the repentance of those who did wrong during the day, and He spreads out His Hand during the day to accept the repentance of those who did wrong during the night. (This will continue) until the sun rises from the west.” (Narrated by Muslim, no. 2759) 
Conditions of repentance in Islam
Sincere repentance is not merely the matter of words spoken on the tongue. Rather, the acceptance of repentance is subject to the conditions that:

the person gives up the sin straight away, 
that he regrets what has happened in the past, 
that he resolves not to go back to the thing he has repented from, 
that he restores people’s rights or property if his sin involved wrongdoing towards others, and 
that he repents before the agony of death is upon him. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“Allah accepts only the repentance of those who do evil in ignorance and foolishness and repent soon afterwards; it is they whom Allah will forgive and Allah is Ever All-Knower, All-Wise.
And of no effect is the repentance of those who continue to do evil deeds until death faces one of them and he says: ‘Now I repent;’ nor of those who die while they are disbelievers. For them We have prepared a painful torment” [al-Nisa 4:17-18] 
Allaah accepts repentance and is Merciful. He calls sinners to repent, so that He might forgive them: 
“…your Lord has written (prescribed) Mercy for Himself, so that if any of you does evil in ignorance, and thereafter repents and does righteous good deeds (by obeying Allah), then surely, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful” [al-An’am 6:54 – interpretation of the meaning]  
Allah is Kind to His slaves and loves those who repent. He accepts their repentance, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And He it is Who accepts repentance from His slaves, and forgives sins, and He knows what you do” [al-Shura 42:25]
 “Truly, Allah loves those who turn unto Him in repentance and loves those who purify themselves” [al-Baqarah 2:222] 
Accepting Islam wipes away all past sins
When anon-Muslim becomes a Muslim, Allah turns his bad deeds (sayyiat) into good deeds (hasanat), and forgives him all his previous sins, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say to those who have disbelieved, if they cease (from disbelief), their past will be forgiven” [al-Anfal 8:38] 
Allah is Forgiving and Merciful, and He loves the repentance of His slaves. He commands them to repent so that He might forgive them. But the devils among mankind and the jinn want to turn people away from the truth and make them incline towards falsehood, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allah wishes to accept your repentance, but those who follow their lusts, wish that you (believers) should deviate tremendously away (from the Right Path) [al-Nisa 4:27] 
The mercy of Allah embraces everything
The mercy of Allah encompasses all things. If a person’s sins are very great and he has wronged himself very much, but he then repents, Allah will accept his repentance and will forgive his sins no matter how great they are. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say: O ‘Ibadi (My slaves) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allah, verily, Allah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful” [al-Zumar 39:53] 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Our Lord comes down to the lowest heaven when one-third of the night remains, and says, ‘Who will call upon Me so that I may answer him? Who will ask Me so that I may give to him? Who will seek My forgiveness so that I may forgive him?’” (Narrated by Muslim, no. 758) 
Man is weak. If a person sins then he has to repent and seek forgiveness every time. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful, and He is the One Who says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And whoever does evil or wrongs himself but afterwards seeks Allah’s forgiveness, he will find Allah Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful” [al-Nisa 4:110] 
The Muslim is vulnerable to making mistakes and sins. So he has to repent and seek forgiveness repeatedly. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “By Allah, I seek the forgiveness of Allah and I turn to Him in repentance more than seventy times each day.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, no. 6307) 
Allah loves the repentance of His slaves, and accepts it. Indeed, He rejoices over it, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When a person repents, Allah rejoices more than one of you who found his camel after he lost it in the desert.” (Agreed upon. Narrated by al-Bukhari, no. 6309)",From Usool al-Deen al-Islami by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem al-Tuwayjri
14296,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14296,Consequences for one who does not adhere to Islam,What are the consequences for one who does not adhere to Islam?,,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          As you know, Islam is the religion of Allaah, and it 
          is the true religion. It is the religion which was brought by all the 
          Prophets and Messengers. Allaah has prepared a great reward in this 
          world and in the hereafter for those who believe in it, and He has prepared 
          a severe punishment for those who disbelieve in it.  
 
          Allaah is the Creator and Sovereign, the One Who is in 
          control of this universe, and you, O man, are part of His creation; 
          He has subjugated to you all that is in the universe, and has prescribed 
          His laws for you, which He has commanded you to follow. If you believe 
          and obey what He has commanded you and keep away from what He has prohibited 
          to you, then you will attain that eternal bliss which He has promised 
          you in the Hereafter, and you will be happy in this world because of 
          the different kinds of blessings which He will bestow upon you, and 
          you will be akin to the most wise of creation and the purest in heart, 
          namely the Prophets, Messengers, righteous and angels who are close 
          to Allaah. 
 
          But if you disbelieve and disobey your Lord, you will 
          lose in this world and in the Hereafter. You will be exposed to His 
          wrath and punishment in this world and in the Hereafter. You will be 
          akin to the most evil and foolish of creation, and worse than the devils, 
          wrongdoers, evildoers and false gods. This is in general terms. 
 
          I will explain to you something about the consequences 
          of kufr, the details of which are as follows: 
 
          1 – Fear and lack of security
 
          Allaah has promised those who believe in Him and follow 
          His Messengers complete security in this world and in the Hereafter. 
          He says (interpretation of the meaning):
 
          “It is those who believe 
          (in the Oneness of Allaah and worship none but Him Alone) and confuse 
          not their Belief with Zulm (wrong, i.e. by worshipping others besides 
          Allaah), for them (only) there is security and they are the guided”
 
          [al-An’aam 6:82]
 
          Allaah is al-Mu’min (the Giver of security) and al-Muhaymin 
          (the Watcher over His creatures); He is the Sovereign of all that exists 
          in the universe. If Allaah loves a person for his faith then He will 
          grant him security, tranquility and contentment. If a man disbelieves 
          in Him He will take away his tranquility and security, so you will only 
          see him either fearful about his destiny in the Hereafter, or fearing 
          sickness for himself, or fearing for his future in this world. This 
          is why the insurance business was established, to insure people’s lives 
          and property, because of the lack of security and the lack of trust 
          in Allaah. 
 
          2 – A life of hardship
 
          Allaah has created man and has subjugated to him all 
          that is in the universe. He has decreed for every creature its share 
          of provision and its life span. So you see the bird going out from its 
          nest in the morning to seek its provision, which it picks up, flying 
          from branch to branch and singing the most beautiful songs. Man is one 
          of these creatures whose provision and lifespan is already allocated. 
          If he believes in his Lord and adheres to His laws, He will bless him 
          with happiness and stability, and make things easy for him, even if 
          he is only given the bare necessities of life. 
 
          But if he disbelieves in Him, and arrogantly refuses 
          to worship him, He will make his life hard and fill him with worries 
          and distress, even if he possesses all kinds of comforts and luxuries. 
          Do you not see how many suicides in the world are committed by people 
          who have all kinds of luxuries? Do you not see the extravagant spending 
          on furniture and travel aimed at enjoying life?  What makes people 
          spend extravagantly is the fact that their hearts are devoid of faith, 
          and their feeling that life is difficult and hard; it is an attempt 
          to rid themselves of these feelings by ever-changing means. Allaah indeed 
          spoke the truth when He said: 
 
          “But whosoever turns away from My Reminder (i.e. neither 
          believes in this Qur’aan nor acts on its teachings) verily, for him 
          is a life of hardship, and We shall raise him up blind on the Day of 
          Resurrection”
 
          [Ta-Ha 20:124]
 
          3 – He will live in conflict with himself and with 
          the universe around him
 
           That is because his own soul was created to believe 
          in and worship Allaah alone (i.e., Tawheed). Allaah says: 
 
          “Allaah’s Fitrah (i.e. Allaah’s Islamic Monotheism) 
          with which He has created mankind”[al-Room 30:30]
 
          His body submits to its Creator, and acts in accordance 
          with His system, but the kaafir insists on going against his own innate 
          nature and lives in such a way that in matters where he is given a choice, 
          he always chooses to follow the way which goes against the command of 
          his Lord, so even if his body is surrendering to the laws of Allaah, 
          in matters of choice he chooses to oppose the laws of Allaah. 
 
          He is in a state of conflict with the universe around 
          him, because this entire universe, from the hugest galaxies to the tiniest 
          insect is operating in accordance with the laws that Allaah has decreed 
          for it. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
 
          “Then He rose over (Istawa) towards the heaven when 
          it was smoke, and said to it and to the earth: ‘Come both of you willingly 
          or unwillingly.’ They both said: ‘We come willingly’”[Fussilat 41:11]
 
          Indeed, this universe loves the one who also submits 
          to Allaah, and it hates the one who goes against that. The kaafir is 
          the rebellious one in this universe, where he sets himself up in opposition 
          to his Lord, rallying others to oppose Him too. Hence it comes as no 
          surprise that the heavens and the earth and all creatures hate him and 
          hate his kufr and heresy. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
 
          “And they say: ‘The Most Gracious (Allaah) has begotten 
          a son (or offspring or children) [as the Jews say: ‘Uzayr (Ezra) is 
          the son of Allaah, and the Christians say that He has begotten a son 
          [‘Eesa (Jesus)], and the pagan Arabs say that He has begotten daughters 
          (angels and others)].’
 
          Indeed you have brought forth (said) a terrible evil 
          thing.
 
          Whereby the heavens are almost torn, and the earth 
          is split asunder, and the mountains fall in ruins,
 
          That they ascribe a son (or offspring or children) 
          to the Most Gracious (Allaah).
 
          But it is not suitable for (the Majesty of) the Most 
          Gracious (Allaah) that He should beget a son (or offspring or children).
 
          There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes 
          unto the Most Gracious (Allaah) as a slave”[Maryam 19:88-93]
 
          And Allaah says of Pharaoh and his troops:
 
          “And the heavens and the earth wept not for them, 
          nor were they given a respite”[al-Dukhaan 44:29]
 
          4 – He will live in ignorance
 
          For kufr is ignorance, indeed it is the greatest form 
          of ignorance, because the kaafir is ignorant of his Lord and he sees 
          this universe that He created in such an amazing way, and he sees how 
          great is his own creation, then he ignores the One Who created this 
          universe and Who created him. Is this not the greatest form of ignorance? 
 
          5 – He will wrong himself and wrong those around him
 
          Because he is subjugating himself to something other 
          than that for which he was created, and because he does not worship 
          his Lord, rather he worships someone other than Him. Wrongdoing means 
          putting something in the wrong place, and what wrongdoing is greater 
          than directing worship to someone other than the One Who deserves it? 
          Luqmaan the Wise said, explaining the abhorrent nature of shirk: 
 
          “O my son! Join not in worship others with Allaah. 
          Verily, joining others in worship with Allaah is a great Zulm (wrong) 
          indeed”
 
          [Luqmaan 31:13 – interpretation of the meaning]
 
          He also does wrong to others around him, humans and other 
          creatures, because he does not recognize the rights of those who have 
          rights. When the Day of Resurrection comes, everyone whom he wronged, 
          whether human or animal, will stand before him and will ask his Lord 
          to settle the score between them. 
 
          6 – He exposes himself to the wrath and anger of Allaah 
          in this world
 
          He is exposed to that because disasters and calamities 
          will befall him, as a punishment in this world. Allaah says (interpretation 
          of the meaning): 
 
          “Do then those who devise evil plots feel secure that 
          Allaah will not sink them into the earth, or that the torment will not 
          seize them from directions they perceive not?
 
          Or that He may catch them in the midst of their going 
          to and fro (in their jobs), so that there be no escape for them (from 
          Allaah’s punishment)?”
 
          [al-Nahl 16:45-46] 
 
          “And a disaster will not cease to strike those who 
          disbelieved because of their (evil) deeds or it (i.e. the disaster) 
          settles close to their homes, until the Promise of Allaah comes to pass. 
          Certainly, Allaah breaks not His Promise”
 
          [al-Ra’d 13:31] 
 
          “Or, did the people of the towns then feel secure 
          against the coming of Our punishment in the forenoon while they were 
          playing?”
 
          [al-A’raaf 7:98]
 
           This is the situation of everyone who turns away 
          from the remembrance of Allaah. Allaah said, telling us of the punishments 
          that befall the earlier disbelieving nations (interpretation of the 
          meaning): 
 
          “So We punished each (of them) for his sins, of them 
          were some on whom We sent Haasib (a violent wind with shower of stones) 
          [as on the people of Loot (Lot)], and of them were some who were overtaken 
          by As-Sayhah [torment — awful cry, (as Thamood or Shu‘ayb’s people)], 
          and of them were some whom We caused the earth to swallow [as Qaaroon 
          (Korah)], and of them were some whom We drowned [as the people of Nooh 
          (Noah), or Fir‘awn (Pharaoh) and his people]. It was not Allaah Who 
          wronged them, but they wronged themselves”
 
          [al-‘Ankaboot 29:40]
 
          And you see the disasters around you that have befallen 
          people as a punishment and vengeance from Allaah. 
 
          7 – Disappointment and loss are decreed for him
 
          Because of his wrongdoing he will lose out on the greatest 
          things that hearts and souls can enjoy, which is knowing Allaah and 
          conversing with Him, and finding peace and contentment in Him. He will 
          lose in this world because he will live a life of misery and confusion 
          therein, and he will lose his own soul for the sake of which he has 
          been striving, because he did not subjugate it to the purpose for which 
          it was created. He will not be happy in this world, because his soul 
          lives a miserable life and dies a miserable death, and it will be resurrected 
          with the doomed. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
 
          “And as for those whose Scale will be light, they 
          are those who will lose their ownselves (by entering Hell)”[al-A’raaf 
          7:9]
 
          And he will lose his family, because he lives with them 
          in a state of disbelief in Allaah, so they are the same as him in their 
          misery and hard life, and their ultimate destiny will be the Fire. Allaah 
          says (interpretation of the meaning): 
 
          “The losers are those who will lose themselves and 
          their families on the Day of Resurrection”[al-Zumar 39:15, al-Shoora 
          42:45]
 
          On the Day of Resurrection they will be gathered into 
          Hell, what an evil abode. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
 
          “(It will be said to the angels): ‘Assemble those 
          who did wrong, together with their companions (from the devils) and 
          what they used to worship,
 
          Instead of Allaah, and lead them on to the way of 
          flaming Fire (Hell)’”
 
          [al-Saaffaat 37:22-23]
 
          He lives disbelieving in his Lord and denying His 
          blessings
 
          Allaah created him from nothing, and bestowed all kinds 
          of blessings upon him. How can he then worship someone other than Him, 
          and take as a friend someone other than Him, and give thanks to someone 
          other than Him? What denial can be greater or more abhorrent than this? 
 
          9 – He will be deprived of true life
 
          That is because the one who deserves a good life is the 
          one who believes in his Lord and knows his purpose in life, who knows 
          where he is going and is certain that he will be resurrected. So he 
          acknowledges the rights of all those who have rights, and he does not 
          deny any rights, or harm any other creature. He lives the life of the 
          blessed and enjoys a good life in this world and in the Hereafter. Allaah 
          says: 
 
          “Whoever works righteousness — whether male or female 
          — while he (or she) is a true believer (of Islamic Monotheism) verily, 
          to him We will give a good life”[al-Nahl 16:97] 
 
          “and pleasant dwellings in ‘Adn (Eden) Paradise; that 
          is indeed the great success”[al-Saff 61:12]
 
          As for the one who lives a life akin to that of the animals, 
          not knowing his Lord or knowing his aim in life or where he is headed, 
          rather his aim is to eat, drink and sleep … what difference is there 
          between him and the rest of the animals? Indeed, he is further astray. 
          Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
 
          “And surely, We have created many of the jinn and 
          mankind for Hell. They have hearts wherewith they understand not, and 
          they have eyes wherewith they see not, and they have ears wherewith 
          they hear not (the truth). They are like cattle, nay even more astray; 
          those! They are the heedless ones”
 
          [al-A’raaf 7:179] 
 
          “Or do you think that most of them hear or understand? 
          They are only like cattle   
          nay, they are even farther astray from the Path (i.e. even worse than 
          cattle)”[al-Furqaan 25:44]
 
          10 – He will be punished eternally
 
          The kaafir will move from one torment to another, in 
          the sense that he will depart from this world – where he is exposed 
          to shocks and calamities – to the Hereafter. In the first stage (of 
          this transition) the angels of death will descend upon him, preceded 
          by the angels of torment who will give him a taste of the punishment 
          that he deserves. Allaah says: 
 
          “And if you could see when the angels take away the 
          souls of those who disbelieve (at death); they smite their faces and 
          their backs…”[al-Anfaal 8:50]
 
           Then when his soul has come forth and he is placed 
          in his grave, he is met with a more severe torment. Allaah says, speaking 
          of the people of Pharaoh: 
 
          “The Fire, they are exposed to it, morning and afternoon. 
          And on the Day when the Hour will be established (it will be said to 
          the angels): ‘Cause Fir‘awn’s (Pharaoh) people to enter the severest 
          torment!’”[Ghaafir 40:46]
 
          Then the Day of Resurrection will come and all creatures 
          will be resurrected and shown their deeds, and the kaafir will see that 
          Allaah has listed all of his deeds in that book of which Allaah says 
          (interpretation of the meaning): 
 
          “And the Book (one’s Record) will be placed (in the 
          right hand for a believer in the Oneness of Allaah, and in the left 
          hand for a disbeliever in the Oneness of Allaah), and you will see the 
          Mujrimoon (criminals, polytheists, sinners), fearful of that which is 
          (recorded) therein. They will say: ‘Woe to us! What sort of Book is 
          this that leaves neither a small thing nor a big thing, but has recorded 
          it with numbers!’”[al-Kahf 18:49]
 
          Then the kaafir will wish that he were dust: 
 
          “the Day when man will see that (the deeds) which 
          his hands have sent forth, and the disbeliever will say: ‘Woe to me! 
          Would that I were dust!’”
 
          [al-Naba’ 78:40 – interpretation of the meaning]
 
          Because of the horrors of that situation [on the Day 
          of Resurrection], if a man possessed all that is on earth he would give 
          it to ransom himself from the torment of that Day. Allaah says (interpretation 
          of the meaning): 
 
          “And those who did wrong (the polytheists and disbelievers 
          in the Oneness of Allaah), if they had all that is in earth and therewith 
          as much again, they verily, would offer it to ransom themselves therewith”
 
          [al-Zumar 39:47]
 
          “The Mujrim, (criminal, sinner, disbeliever) would 
          desire to ransom himself from the punishment of that Day by his children.
 
          And his wife and his brother,
 
          And his kindred who sheltered him, 
 
          And all that are in the earth, so that it might save 
          him”
 
          [al-Ma’aarij 70:11-14]
 
          That abode is the abode of requital and not the abode 
          of hope, so man must inevitably face the requital for his deeds: if 
          they were good, then it will be good, and if they were bad, then it 
          will be bad. The worst that the kaafir will encounter on the Day of 
          Resurrection will be the torment of the Fire. Allaah has created different 
          kinds of torment for its inhabitants so that they may taste the consequences 
          of their deeds. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
 
          “This is the Hell which the Mujrimoon (polytheists, 
          criminals, sinners) denied. 
 
          They will go between it (Hell) and the fierce boiling 
          water!”
          [al-Rahmaan 55:43-44]
 
          And He says, describing their drink and clothing (interpretation 
          of the meaning): 
 
          “then as for those who disbelieved, garments of fire 
          will be cut out for them, boiling water will be poured down over their 
          heads.
 
          With it will melt (or vanish away) what is within 
          their bellies, as well as (their) skins.
 
          And for them are hooked rods of iron (to punish them)”
 
          [al-Hajj 22:19-21]",From al-Islam Usooluhu wa Mabaadi’uhu by Dr. Muhammad ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Saalih al-Suhaym
14299,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14299,Revocably divorced woman staying in her husband’s house until her ‘iddah is over,"Can a woman who has been revocably divorced (first or second talaaq) stay in her husband’s house, or should she go to her father’s house until her husband takes her back?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.A woman who has been revocably divorced has to stay in her husband’s house, and it is haraam for her husband to ask her to leave, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And turn them not out of their (husband’s) homes nor shall they (themselves) leave, except in case they are guilty of some open illegal sexual intercourse. And those are the set limits of Allah. And whosoever transgresses the set limits of Allah, then indeed he has wronged himself” [al-Talaaq 65:1]
What the people do nowadays, when a woman is revocably divorced and she goes straight to her family’s house, is wrong and is haraam, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And turn them not out of their (husband’s) homes nor shall they (themselves) leave ” [al-Talaaq 65:1]
No exception is made unless the woman has committed a blatant act of immorality. Then after that Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And those are the set limits of Allah. And whosoever transgresses the set limits of Allah, then indeed he has wronged himself” [al-Talaaq 65:1]
Then He explains the wisdom behind the woman being obliged to stay in her husband’s house, as He says: 
“You (the one who divorces his wife) know not it may be that Allah will afterward bring some new thing to pass (i.e. to return her back to you if that was the first or second divorce)” [al-Talaaq 65:1]
So her staying in the marital home may be the cause of the husband rescinding the divorce and taking her back, which is what is desired by sharee’ah.
 The Muslims have to pay attention to the limits set by Allah, and adhere to what Allah has enjoined upon them. They should not take customs and traditions as a means to go against the commands of sharee’ah. What matters is that we are obliged to pay attention to this matter. The woman who is revocably divorced should want to stay in her husband’s house until her ‘iddah ends. In this case whilst staying in her husband’s house she is permitted to uncover in front of him, and to adorn herself and put on makeup and perfume, and speak to him and sit with him, and do everything apart from intimacy and intercourse – which can only take place after he takes her back. He may take her back verbally, by saying: “I take my wife back,” or by actions, such as having intercourse with her with the intention of taking her back.","Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen., Majmoo’at As’ilat tahumm al-Usrah al-Muslimah, p. 61"
