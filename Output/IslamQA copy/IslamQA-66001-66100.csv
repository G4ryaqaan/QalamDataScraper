66017,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/66017,The Sunnah is for the imam to be in line with the middle of the row,How should the rows behind the imam fill in – the first row and the other rows?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.The Sunnah is for the 
    imam to stand in line with the middle of the row, so the row should start 
    from immediately behind the imam, then be completed to the right and left. 
    It does not matter if there are slightly more people on the right than on 
    the left. 

    Abu Dawood (681) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “Put the imam in the middle and fill the gaps.” 

    Al-Manaawi said in Fayd al-Qadeer: 

    i.e., put him in the middle of the row so that everyone on 
    his right and left can have a share of hearing him and being close to him. 
    End quote. 

    But this hadeeth is da’eef (weak) and was classed as such by 
    al-Albaani in Da’eef Abi Dawood. 
There are other, saheeh, 
    ahaadeeth which clearly indicate the same as this da’eef hadeeth, namely 
    that the imam should stand in line with the middle of the row. 

    Al-Bukhaari (424) and Muslim (33) narrated from ‘Itbaan ibn 
    Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) came to him in his house and said: “Where 
    would you like me to pray for you in your house?” He said: I pointed to a 
    place and the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said 
    takbeer, and we formed a row behind him and he prayed two rak'ahs. 

    Al-Bukhaari (380) and Muslim (658) narrated from Anas ibn 
    Maalik that his grandmother Mulaykah invited the Messenger of Allaah  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to come and eat some food that 
    she had prepared for him. He ate some, then he said: “Get up and I will lead 
    you in prayer.” Anas said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) stood up, and the orphan and I stood in a row behind 
    him, and the old woman stood behind us, and the Messenger of Allaah  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) led us in praying two rak’ahs, 
    then he left. 

    Muslim (3014) narrated that Jaabir said: I prayed with the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and stood on his 
    left. He took me by the hand and made me stand on his right. Then Jabbaar 
    ibn Sakhr came and did wudoo’, then he came and stood on the left of the 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). The 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) took 
    hold of our hands and made us stand behind him. 

    The words “we formed a row behind him”, “the orphan and I 
    stood behind him” and ‘he made us stand behind him” indicate that they were 
    directly behind the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him), i.e., the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was 
    in line with the middle of the row. 

    Al-Shawkaani said in al-Sayl al-Jaraar (1/261): 
Two or more people should 
    stand behind him in line with him. 

    In order for them to be in line with him, they should be 
    behind him. If they stand to one side, not in line with him, they would not 
    be behind him. End quote. 

    Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni (2/27): 
It is mustahabb for the 
    imam to stand in line with the middle of the row, because the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Put the imam in the 
    middle and fill the gaps.” Narrated by Abu Dawood. End quote. 

    Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmoo’ (4/192) 

    Our companions and others are agreed that the first row is 
    recommended and encouraged. There are many ahaadeeth concerning that in 
    al-Saheeh. They are also agreed that it is mustahabb to stand to the 
    right of the imam and to fill the gaps in the rows, and complete the first 
    row, then the next, then the next and so on. No row should be started until 
    the one in front is complete. It is also mustahabb to make the row straight, 
    and no one should let his chest etc stick out from the row to the front or 
    to the rear. It is mustahabb for the imam to stand in the middle and for 
    them to spread to either side. End quote. 

    It says in al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (27/37): 

    It is proper etiquette to complete the row and fill any gaps, 
    and not to start a row until the one in front is complete, and to make room 
    for one who wants to join the row if there is space. The imam should stand 
    in the middle with the worshippers behind him. End quote. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’ 
    (3/10): 

    Straightening the rows also means preferring the right side 
    to the left, but that is not to be taken in absolute terms, as is the case 
    with regard to the first row, because if it were in absolute terms as is the 
    case with regard to the first row, the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) would have said, “Complete the rows from 
    the right hand side” but he said: “Complete the first row, then the next.” 
    Since it is not prescribed to start the rows from the right until they are 
    completed, then we should look at the basic principles of sharee’ah to see 
    how this should be done with regard to the left. We find that with regard to 
    the left, if the right and the left are more or less equal, then the right 
    side is given preference, such as if there are five on the left and five on 
    the right, and an eleventh man comes, we would tell him to go to the right, 
    because the right is better than the left when both are equal or almost 
    equal, and there is no obvious difference between the right and the left of 
    the row. But if one side is further away, then there is no doubt that 
    joining the left if it is closer is better than joining the right if it is 
    far away. This is indicated by the fact that if there is a group of three, 
    it is prescribed for the imam to stand between the other two. This indicates 
    that the right is not better in absolute terms, because if it were better in 
    absolute terms, it would be better for both people to be to the right of the 
    imam. But it is prescribed for one to be on the right of the imam and one on 
    his left so that the imam will be in the middle and there will be no 
    imbalance between the two sides. End quote. 

    Shaykh Ibn Baaz was asked: Should the two begin from the 
    right or from behind the imam? Is it prescribed to achieve balance between 
    the right and left so that it may be said “Make the row equal on both sides” 
    as many imams do? 

    He replied: The row should start from the middle, from behind 
    the imam. And the right side of each row is better than the left. A new row 
    should not be started until the one in front is completed. There is nothing 
    wrong with there being more people on the right side of a row, and there is 
    no need to make the row equal on both sides, rather the command to do that 
    is contrary to the Sunnah. But people should not form a second row until the 
    first is complete, or form a third row until the second is complete, and so 
    on, because it is proven that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) enjoined that. End quote.

      The Ibaadis are a Khaariji sect, which is one of the 
      misguided sects. There are many saheeh texts which condemn them.

    In the answer to question no. 
    40147 we quoted the scholars of 
    the Standing Committee as saying: 

    The Ibaadi sect is one of the misguided sects, because of 
    their hatred, enmity and rebellion against ‘Uthmaan ibn ‘Affaan and ‘Ali 
    (may Allaah be pleased with them), and it is not permissible to pray behind 
    them. End quote. 

    In Fataawa al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem (13/30) it 
    says that the testimony of an Ibaadi is not acceptable according to 
    sharee’ah. 
There are clear texts 
    which describe how a woman’s guardians should make a good choice of husband 
    for her. That includes ensuring that his religious commitment and character 
    are acceptable. What kind of pleasing religious commitment can there be in 
    those who follow misguided sects, who believe in rebelling against the 
    rulers of the Muslims, who believe that the Qur’aan was created and that the 
    one who commits a major sin is a kaafir, and who deny that we will see 
    Allaah in the Hereafter? 

    It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with 
    him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “If there comes to you one with whose religious commitment 
    and character you are pleased, then marry (your daughter or female relative 
    under your care) to him, for if you do not, there will be fitnah in the land 
    and much mischief.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1084; Ibn Maajah, 1967. Classed 
    as hasan by Shaykh al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 1022. 
Sunni women should not 
    be given in marriage to followers of innovation, because the husband has a 
    great deal of influence over his wife, and he may influence her to adopt his

66062,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/66062,"She was not certain that her period had ended, and she prayed and fasted","I did ghusl at night, at the time of sahoor, because I knew that my period would end that day, and I ate sahoor and I fasted and prayed as well. Nothing came out of me during the time from Fajr until the adhaan of Maghrib, and when I wanted to go and pray, I discovered that the period had ended. Are my fasting and prayers valid?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for a menstruating woman to hasten to do ghusl and pray and fast until she is certain that her period has ended.
A woman may know that her period has ended from the emission of a white discharge which is known to women. Some women know that their period has ended when the blood stops. 
So a woman should not do ghusl until she is certain that the menses has stopped. 
Imam al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
“Chapter on the beginning and end of menses; the women used to send to ‘Aa’ishah pieces of cloth on which were traces of yellow, and she would say: ‘Do not hasten until you see the white discharge,’ meaning thereby purification from menses. Bint Zayd ibn Thaabit heard that the women were calling for lamps in the middle of the night to see whether their periods had ended, and she said: ‘Women never used to do that,’ and she criticized them.” End quote. 
Pieces of cotton refers to pieces of cloth which the women would use to check whether the period had ended. The white discharge refers to if they used the piece of cotton and it came away clean with no trace of yellow. 
Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said: 
The scholars are agreed that the onset of menses is known from the emission of blood at the time when menstruation is possible, but they differed with regard to the end of menses. It was said that it is known by the cessation of bleeding, which is when something inserted into the vagina comes out dry; or it was said that it is when the white discharge appears – this was the view favoured by al-Bukhaari. 
This also indicates that the white discharge is a sign of the end of the menses and the onset of the period of purity (tahaarah). The view that it is known from the cessation of bleeding is countered by the fact that a cloth may come out dry during the period and that does not mean that the menses is over. This is unlike the white discharge which is emitted by the uterus when the menses stops. Maalik said: I asked women about that and it is something that is known to them, which they recognize at the end of the menses. 
Fath al-Baari, 1/420 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: If a woman’s period ends before Fajr and she does ghusl after, what is the ruling? 
He replied: 
Her fast is valid if she was certain that her period had ended before dawn came. What matters is that the woman is certain that she has become pure (i.e., that her period has ended). Because some women think that they have become pure when they have not. Hence the women used to bring their cotton pads to ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) and ask them whether the sign of purity was there, and she would say to them: “Do not be hasty until you see the white discharge.” 
Women have to wait until they are certain that the menses has ended. If a woman has become pure, then she should form the intention to fast even if she does not do ghusl until after dawn comes. But she should also pay attention to the prayer and hasten to do ghusl so that she can pray Fajr on time. 
Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 17/question no. 53 
The questioner did ghusl at a time when she was not certain that her period had ended, and she discovered later on that she was in fact pure, after sunset according to her own account. 
Based on this, what she did was not correct, and her fast on that day was not valid, so she has to make up that day. 
We ask Allaah to grant her beneficial knowledge and enable her to do righteous deeds.

Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Quran, a guidance for mankind and clear proofs for the guidance and the criterion (between right and wrong)” [al-Baqarah 2:185]
Jibreel used to come to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) every night in Ramadan, and study the Quran with him. Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5; Muslim, 4268. 
Al-Bukhari (4614) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that Jibreel used to review the Quran with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) once each year, and in the year in which he died, he reviewed it with him twice. From this it may be understood that it is mustahabb to read Quran a great deal and to study it during Ramadan. 
See also question no. 50781 
It may also be understood that it is mustahabb to complete the Quran (during Ramadan), because Jibreel (peace be upon him) used to review the entire Quran with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
See Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 11/331 
Both memorizing and reviewing are reading, because no one can memorize or review except after repeatedly reading the verse several times, and for every letter there is a reward of ten hasanahs.
Based on this, it is better to focus on memorizing and reviewing. 
So the Sunnah indicates that: 
1-We should review what we have learned
2-We should study together
3-We should read. This is achieved when doing the first two.
In this case a person should complete the Quran, even if it is only once during the month, then he should do whatever is most appropriate in his case, either reading more and completing the Quran, or focusing on reviewing, or memorizing new passages. He should do what is best for him. It may be better for him to memorize or read or review. The Quran is meant to be read and pondered, and it is meant to influence and be acted upon. 
The believer should examine his heart, see what is best for him, and do that.

66074,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/66074,Can a person who has incontinence pray with the congregation?,A man in my family is suffering from incontinence. Does he have to pray in congregation with the imam or should he pray on his own?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    If a person is suffering from urinary incontinence, one of 
    the following two scenarios must apply: 
1 – It is continuous and 
    does not stop for long enough for him to do wudoo’ and pray. In this case he 
    must clean himself and use something to stop the urine spreading. He should 
    do wudoo’ after the time for the prayer begins, then pray with the 
    congregation like all other people. But if he is afraid that he may 
    contaminate the mosque, it is not permissible for him to enter, and he 
    should pray at home, in congregation if possible, or on his own. 

    Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni (1/201): 
As for the woman who is 
    suffering from istihaadah (non-menstrual vaginal bleeding), her case is like 
    that of one who is suffering from urinary incontinence. They may stay in the 
    mosque and pass through it if there is no risk of contamination of the 
    mosque, because it was narrated from ‘Aa’ishah that one of the wives of the 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    observed i'tikaaf with him when she was suffering from istihaadah. She used 
    to see red and yellow discharge, and sometimes she would place a bowl 
    beneath her when she prayed. Narrated by al-Bukhaari… If there is the fear 
    of contaminating the mosque, then he should not pass through the mosque, 
    because the mosque should be protected from that, as it should be protected 
    from people urinating in it. If the menstruating woman fears that the mosque 
    may be contaminated as the result of her passing through it, then she should 
    not do that. End quote. 

    Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmoo’, 2/177: 

    It is haraam to bring any impurity into the mosque. As for a 
    person who has any impurity in his body or is wounded, if he fears that the 
    mosque may be contaminated it is haraam for him to enter, but if there is no 
    such risk it is not haraam. The evidence for that is the hadeeth of Anas 
    (may Allaah be pleased with him), according to which the Messenger of Allaah 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “These mosques are 
    not for urine and filth, rather they are for the remembrance of Allaah 
    (dhikr) and recitation of Qur’aan,” or as the Messenger of Allaah  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said. Narrated by Muslim. End 
    quote.

     2 – If the emission stops after a while for long enough for 
    him to do wudoo’ and pray, such as if he knows that after relieving himself 
    the emission of urine will stop after an hour – for example. In this case he 
    should delay praying until the time when the urine will stop, even if that 
    leads to him missing the prayer in congregation. In that case he should pray 
    with his family if possible, so that he may attain the virtue of praying in 
    congregation.  

    The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked: There is a 
    man who is suffering from incontinence, but he remains pure for a while 
    after urinating. If he waits for the incontinence to stop, the prayer in 
    congregation will be over. What is the ruling? 
They replied: If he knows 
    that the incontinence will end, it is not permissible for him to pray whilst 
    this problem is with him, seeking the virtue of praying in congregation. 
    Rather he has to wait until (the incontinence) ends, then he should clean 
    himself, do wudoo’ and pray, even if he misses the prayer in congregation. 
    But he should hasten to clean himself and do wudoo’ after the time for 
    prayer begins, in the hope that he will be able to pray with the 
    congregation.

    If a person is in his hometown, then he decides to travel, he

Once this is 
    established, it is not permissible for him to break the fast until he has 
    left the houses behind, i.e., he has gone past them and has left the 
    buildings behind. Al-Hasan said: He may break the fast in his house, if he 
    wishes, on the day that he intends to leave. Something similar was narrated 
    from ‘Ata’. Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said: The view of al-Hasan is odd; no one is 
    allowed to break the fast when not travelling, and there is no evidence for 
    that, either rationally or in the reports. A different opinion was also

The one who is present 
    and sights the moon is not regarded as being a traveller until he has left 
    the town. So long as he is still in the town, the rulings on those who are

    that he leave his town first? Or once he decides to travel and gets into his 
    means of transportation is he allowed to break the fast? 

    The answer is that two views have been narrated from the 
    salaf. 

    Some of the scholars are of the view that it is permissible 
    to break the fast once he is ready to travel and there is nothing left to do 
    but get into the means of transportation. They narrated that this is what 
    Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) used to do. But if you study the verse 
    you will see that this is not correct, because up till now he has not 
    started to travel and he is still a resident and non-traveller. Based on 
    this, it is not permissible for a person to break the fast until he has left 
    the houses of the town behind. 

    The correct view is that he should not break the fast until 
    he has left the village. Hence it is not permissible to shorten the prayer 
    until one has left the town, and it is not permissible to break the fast 
    until one has left the town. End quote. 

    Based on that, if a person decides at night that he is going 
    to travel, it is not permissible for him to start the day not fasting, 
    rather he must form the intention to fast, then if he travels in the 
    morning, he may break the fast after leaving his town. 

    Conclusion: if a person decides at night that he is not going 
    to fast on the basis that he is going to travel the next day, he has made a 
    mistake, and he has to make up that day, even if we assume that he did not 
    travel, because he did not have the intention to fast from the night before, 
    and the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “Whoever does not intend to fast from before dawn, there is no fast for him 
    (i.e., his fast does not count).” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2454’ al-Tirmidhi, 
    730; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.  
In the event that he 
    does not travel, he must refrain from everything that breaks the fast for 
    the rest of the day, out of respect for the month, because he has broken the 
    fast without a legitimate shar’i excuse. 

    See al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 6/209 

    The questioner has to seek Allaah’s forgiveness and repent to 
    Him from what he has done, and he has to make up that day.
