He made a deal with them on the basis of specific conditions, one of which was that he will tell them of any income he receives from any source. 

After a while he found work but he did not receive any payment from the boss until after four months. During these four months he did not tell them anything because he had not received anything. In the fifth month he received his money in full from the boss, but he spent it all paying off debts that he owed. Then after that he told the social services that he had found work and signed off the dole. What is the ruling on the money that he received during those four months? Does he have to repay it to the government, knowing that he was obliged to tell them about the debt but he did not? 

Another issue is that he does not have the full amount that he took from them. Thirdly, if he tells them now the matter may go to the police and he will have a big problem but may be pardoned, depending on the official who examines the case. The brother regrets it now and wants to set matters straight.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    
    Taking wealth from non-Muslims in treacherous and deceitful ways is haram 
    (impermissible), because deceit is haram in Islam, whether it is done to a 
    Muslim or to a non-Muslim. 

    
    What a Muslim is obliged to do is to respect the agreement that exists 
    between him and that country, even if it is a non-Muslim state, because the 
    fact that it is non-Muslim does not mean that it is permissible for him to 
    violate that agreement or betray it and consume its wealth unlawfully. 

    
    The brother should have disclosed his work regardless of the debt that he 
    concealed from them. 

    
    If Allah guides a Muslim to repent from taking people’s wealth unlawfully, 
    then one of the conditions of this repentance is that he should return to 
    people what is rightfully theirs, even if they are non-Muslims. If there is 
    the fear of humiliation or criminal charges if he returns money to the 
    social services department, then it is permissible for him to look for a 
    suitable way of preserving his dignity whilst also returning money to its 
    rightful owner without embarrassing himself, such as sending the money in 
    the mail or delegating someone to take it to them without mentioning his 
    name or what he did to them. It is not essential for the one who wants to 
    return things to their rightful owners to disclose himself or his identity, 
    because the purpose is to return things to their rightful owners. 

    
    For information on the evidence for this ruling, the views of the scholars 
    and what he must do after having repented, please see the answers to 
    questions no.

    If he does not have the whole amount, he may return what he can afford now, 
    and the rest will remain a debt that he owes, which he must return when he 
    is able to.

50718,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50718,Is there a specific du’aa’ to be recited after each two rak’ahs of Taraaweeh?,Is there a specific du’aa’ to be recited after each two rak’ahs of Taraaweeh?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Dhikr is a kind of worship, and the basic principle concerning acts of worship is that they are not allowed unless there is evidence to indicate that they are obligatory or mustahabb. It is not permissible to invent a dhikr to be done with an act of worship or before or after it. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) prayed qiyaam with his Companions at night, and the Sahaabah prayed qiyaam individually and in congregation, during his lifetime and after his death, and there is no report that they remembered Allaah by reciting a specific du’aa’ after each tasleem. The scholars did not narrate any report of a dhikr recited in unison between each two rak’ahs of taraaweeh by the Sahaabah or those who came after them. This indicates that that did not happen, because the scholars used to narrate that which was more hidden and subtle than this outward, obvious matter. The best of guidance is in following the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and following his companions in matters of worship, by doing what they did and avoiding what they avoided. 
But there is nothing wrong with a worshipper supplicating Allaah (du’aa’) or reciting Qur’aan, or remembering his Lord (dhikr), without singling out specific verses or soorahs or dhikrs to be recited between the rak’ahs, and without that being recited in unison, led by an imam or anyone else, because that is not narrated in sharee’ah. The basic principle is to accept what is narrated in sharee’ah concerning acts of worship, how often they are done, how they are done, when they are done, where they are done, the reason why they are done and the way in which they are done. 
Shaykh Muhammad al-‘Abdari ibn al-Haaj said in his book al-Madkhal: Chapter on Dhikr after each two rak'ahs of Taraaweeh prayer: 
He – the imam – should avoid what has been innovated of reciting dhikr after each two rak’ahs of Taraaweeh prayer and raising the voice in that, and reciting it in unison. All of that is bid’ah. It is also forbidden for the muezzin to say after the dhikr following each two rak’ahs of taraaweeh, “Al-salaah yarhamukum Allaah (Prayer, may Allaah have mercy on you),” because this is also an innovation and innovation in religion is forbidden. The best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), then the four caliphs who came after him, then the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them all), and it is not narrated that any of the salaf did that, and we should be content with what was sufficient for them.

50726,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50726,Zakah on Trade Goods and Shop Fittings,"I have a shop in which there is equipment worth 80,000 riyals, and there are people who owe the shop debts totalling 80,000 riyals. There was a fire in the shop 6 months ago and new merchandise has been and renovations have been done, which together add up to 40,000, of which 35,000 has been borrowed in the name of the shop, to be paid back in instalments. 
My first question is: should we pay zakah on the total amount of equipment that was in the store before the fire? Total cost + debts – new stock and renovation. 
My second question is: A full year has not yet passed since the renovations; should we pay zakah on it or only on the whole shop and the debts that we are owed?","It is obligatory to pay zakah on trade goods. Fixtures that are not prepared for sale are not subject to zakah. It is permissible to pay zakah on trade goods in kind, and it does not have to be paid in cash. Zakah is to be paid on the sale price, not the purchase price.","Types of goods in shops


Zakah on trade good


Zakah on lost goods","Praise be to Allah.Types of goods in shops
The goods that are found in a shop fall into two categories: 

Those that are prepared for sale, whether they are real estate, food, clothes, or other kinds of goods that are sold. 
Those that are not prepared for sale, rather they are for producing goods or are to be used, such as manufacturing equipment , cars, furniture, cameras and computers, etc. 

The first category are those that are called “trade goods” and these are the ones on which zakah must be paid. As for the second category, they are known as fixed assets, and no zakah is due on them. 
In the answer to question no. 42072 , we stated that it is obligatory to pay zakah on trade goods, and we explained the nisab (minimum threshold), and the fact that fixtures that are not prepared for sale are not subject to zakah. 
In the answer to question no. 22449 , we explained that it is permissible to pay zakah on trade goods in kind , and that it does not have to be paid in cash . 
For information on how to calculate zakah on trade goods , please see the answer to question no. 26236 , in which it explains that zakah is to be paid on the sale price , not the purchase price. 
Zakah on trade good
In conclusion, if the time for paying zakah on your shop has come, then you should take stock of what you have in the shop, such as the goods that you have there, and add them to whatever you have of cash, and add that total to the debts that you hope will be paid back, then pay zakah on the total at a rate of one-quarter of one-tenth. 
As for the debts which you have no hope that they will be paid back because they are owed by people who delay payment or who are poor, then no zakah is due on them until you take possession of them and start to reckon a new year from the day you receive them.
In order to be on the safe side, when you receive them, pay zakah for one year only, even if several years have passed. Please see question no. 1346 . 
The debts that you owe are not to be deducted from the wealth on which you have to pay zakah, according to the more correct scholarly view. See question no. 22426 . 
Zakah on lost goods
The goods that were lost in the fire are not to be added to the total of goods in the store. 
As for the things that you put in the store after the fire, if they have to do with furnishings, décor and fixtures, then as we have stated above, no zakah is due on them, so they should not be included among the goods in the store that are subject to zakah. If they are goods that are for sale, then if you bought them with the shop’s funds and profits, then zakah should be paid on them when you pay zakah for the shop’s goods even if one year has not yet passed. If you bought them with other money that does not belong to the store, then you should count one year from the time when you acquired the wealth with which you bought them.  
We ask Allah to compensate you with good and to bless you with a goodly provision.

50731,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50731,Smacking and Pinching a One-Year Old Child,"for wealth and offspring. Allaah has blessed me with a beautiful child, but I have strange feelings towards this child. When he cries, I lose control and I smack him, pinch him etc, then afterwards I feel physically and mentally shaken. I love him dearly and when people pick him up he laughs and plays with them, but when he sees me he cries and screams. My son is one year old. Please note that I pray and fast.",,,"Praise be to Allah.This manner 
    of treating your son is very strange. There follows some advice, perhaps 
    Allaah will cause you to benefit from it:  
1 – A small 
    child needs food, drink, sleep and air, and love and compassion are among 
    the best kinds of food that the parents can give their child. Giving 
    physical food without this emotional nourishment is neglect of the child’s 
    natural need for both. 
2 – Showing 
    compassion to the child brings positive results. Hence we are advised to 
    breastfeed the child naturally so that the goodness of food and drink will 
    be combined with the goodness of being in the proper place, which is his 
    mother’s lap. Hence modern science has discovered the great effects that 
    mother’s milk has on the physical and emotional development of the child and 
    – conversely – the negative effects of depriving the child of his mother’s 
    milk and care. Societies in which violence towards children is widespread 
    have become societies in which crime and evildoing has become widespread. 
Some 
    sociologists have stated that the parent’s ongoing smacking and rebuking of 
    their children leads to psychological complexes in the child and increases 
    family violence. This leads to a problem which is difficult to confront, 
    because violence in the home leads to violence in society, which becomes 
    widespread, and the victims of this violence in turn inflict psychological 
    terrorism on individuals, which threatens the security of the society. 
3 – The one 
    who is harsh towards his children is going against sound human nature 
    (fitrah) and sharee’ah (Islamic law). Allaah has created people with love for their children. Hence Allaah and His Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) did not enjoin parents to care for their children in this 
    manner (because it is innate). On the contrary, Islam enjoins children to 
    care for their fathers and mothers, and warns them against disobeying them. 
As for going 
    against sharee’ah: smacking children and not showing compassion towards them 
    is indicative of a lack of mercy in the heart of the one who does that, 
    which is a sign of being deprived of the mercy of Allaah, may He be 
    exalted. 
It was 
    narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) kissed 
    al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali when al-Aqra’ ibn Haabis al-Tameemi was sitting with him. 
    Al-Aqra’ said: I have ten children and I have never kissed one of them. The 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “The one who does not show mercy will not be shown mercy.” 
Narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari (5651) and Muslim (2318). 
It was 
    narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: A Bedouin 
    came to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and 
    said: Do you kiss children? We do not kiss them. The Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “What can I do for you if Allaah has 
    removed mercy from your heart?” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5652). 
Our 
    Prophet’s compassion towards children was so great that he would shorten the 
    prayer because of their crying, out of compassion towards them and their 
    mothers. 
It was 
    narrated from Anas ibn Maalik that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “I start to pray intending to make it long, then I 
    hear the crying of a child, so I make it short because of his mother’s 
    distress.” 
Narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari (677) and Muslim (470). 
4 – You 
    should understand that you are falling short in raising your child by doing 
    this, and you may see the evil consequences of it in this world before the 
    Hereafter. How can such treatment produce a good upbringing and a sound, 
    righteous child? 
5 – You 
    should understand that a child’s crying does not happen for no reason, 
    rather every kind of crying has its cause. So you should feel compassion 
    towards him when he is crying, so that you will be motivated to find the 
    cause, such as sickness or hunger. You should not be quick to smack him or 
    pinch him or mistreat him, lest you add another reason, which is crying 
    because of pain. 
A 
    psychologist said: Psychologists think that crying, like other behaviour, is 
    usually a means of relieving tension. So crying, screaming, yelling, 
    breaking toys and possessions and fidgeting are all ways of expressing 
    tension that is connected to anger or grief, because the frustration that 
    the child is faced with may create aggressiveness in him, so crying is a way 
    to expressing this aggression and getting rid of it. Not crying may be 
    indicative of suppression of this aggression, which may then move to the 
    subconscious where the child may forget it, but it will not be hidden 
    completely and it may manifest itself when he grows older in the form of 
    sickness, anxiety, and aggression whenever the child finds an opportunity. 
6 – You 
    should also note that shaking a child may cause mental or physical 
    disability, so how about if he is smacked? 
American 
    researchers have warned that shaking children may cause death or severe 
    mental disability. Researchers have explained that destruction of the brain 
    may occur when a child is shaken violently. It may cause them to die or may 
    cause nerve damage and mental disability, such as learning disabilities, 
    mental paralysis, blindness, convulsions, difficulty in reading, attention 
    deficit disorder and other educational problems. 
One female 
    specialist said: Infants’ crying is annoying and disturbing, but it is their 
    only way to express their needs, so first of all we need to find out the 
    reason why the infant is crying and hasten to tend to it, instead of shaking 
    him. She emphasized that boys are more likely to be harmed than girls, as 
    57% of victims are male. 
Researchers 
    noted that shaking a child violently when he cries or throwing him up in the 
    air and catching him, or shaking him violently on one's knees or jogging 
    with him are all factors that may lead to brain damage, as the result of the 
    brain being knocked against the skull, which causes blood vessels to break 
    and leads to haemorrhaging in the brain. Experts have pointed out that 
    nursing infants and newborns are the most likely to suffer disability 
    resulting from shaking, in comparison to older children. 
Conclusion: 
    You have to fear Allaah and not go against the fitrah (sound human nature) 
    or the laws of Allaah. You should be compassionate towards your beautiful 
    child and do not cause him to be lost or disabled, then you would have to 
    live your whole life with this mistake. Look at the life of the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his companions, and let them 
    be a good example for you.  
Strive to 
    make du’aa’ (supplication) and recite ruqyah (incantations) for yourself, your family and your child, lest you be afflicted by the evil eye or witchcraft. Ruqyah is beneficial in all cases.  
We hope that 
    you will be guided aright and that your child will be safe from harm. We ask Allaah to help you to raise him soundly.

50732,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50732,Does a man have to ask his wife for permission to observe a voluntary fast as is required of her?,"A woman has to ask her husband’s permission to fast, I mean apart from the month of Ramadaan, and that is because of his right to have intercourse with her whenever he wants, and she is obliged to obey him. Does she also have the right for him to ask her permission to fast?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade wives to observe voluntary fasts when their husbands are present without their permission. 
It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible for a woman to fast when her husband is present except with his permission.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5195; Muslim, 1026. 
A version narrated by Ahmad (9813) says: “No woman should fast a single day when her husband is present except with his permission, except Ramadaan.” 
Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Targheeb, 1052. 
Al-Nawawi said: 
This is to be understood as referring to voluntary and recommended fasts for which there is no specific time. This prohibition implies that it is haraam.  The reason for that is that the husband has the right to enjoy his wife on all days, and his right must be responded to immediately and not cancelled out by a voluntary fast or an obligatory fast that could be done some other time. 
Sharh Muslim, 7/115 
Secondly: 
The reason why this prohibition is addressed to women and not to men may be explained as follows: 
1 – The husband’s right over his wife is stronger than her right over him, so it is not correct to draw an analogy between husband and wife on this point.
 Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni, 7/223: 
Thus the husband’s right over the wife is greater than her right over him, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“but men have a degree (of responsibility) over them”
[al-Baqarah 2:228]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If I were to command anyone to prostrate to anyone else, I would have commanded women to prostrate to their husbands, because of the rights that Allaah has given them over them.” Narrated by Abu Dawood. 
End quote. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in al-Fataawa al-Kubra (3/144): 
After the duties she owes to Allaah and His Messenger, no right is more binding on a woman than the rights of her husband. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If I were to command anyone to prostrate to anyone else, I would have commanded women to prostrate to their husbands, because of the greatness of the rights that he (the husband) has over her.” 
End quote. 
2 – The husband is usually the one who initiates intercourse, and the woman is the one who is sought. So usually it is he who pursues her, so it is appropriate that she should ask his permission before observing a naafil fast, because he may want to have intercourse with her. 
3 – Men’s desire is greater than women’s, hence it is permissible for a man to marry up to four wives. This does not apply in the case of women. Hence men are less able to be patient in refraining from intercourse than women are. This is why women are required to ask permission to fast, and it is why a strong warning is issued to women not to refuse intercourse when their husbands call them. 
The context of the hadeeth supports this reason. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade women to observe voluntary fasts without permission when a woman’s husband complained about her and said that he wanted to have intercourse with her, but she fasted a great deal and his rights were not being fulfilled. 
It was narrated that Abu Sa’eed (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: A woman came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when we were with him, and said: “O Messenger of Allaah, my husband, Safwaan ibn al-Mu’attal, hits me when I pray and he makes me break my fast when I am fasting, and he does not pray Fajr until the sun is rising.” Safwaan was with him, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) asked him about what she had said. He said: “O Messenger of Allaah, as for saying that I hit her when she prays, she recites two soorahs and I told her not to.” He said: “If it is one soorah, that is sufficient for people.” He said: “As for her saying that I make her break her fast, she goes ahead and fasts, and I am a young man and I cannot be patient.” The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said on that day: “No woman should fast except with her husband’s permission.” “As for her saying that I do not pray until the sun is rising, we are a household who are used to that, and we cannot wake up until the sun is rising.” He said: “When you wake up, then pray.” 
Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2459. 
Classed as saheeh by Ibn Hibbaan, 4/354; al-Haafiz ibn Hajar in al-Isaabah, 3/441; al-Albaani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel, 7/65 
Shaykh Muhammad al-Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
One of his rights over her is that she should not do anything that detracts from his right to complete enjoyment of her, even if that is a voluntary act of worship, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible for a woman to fast when her husband is present except with his permission, or to allow anyone into his house without his permission.” 
Huqooq da’at ilayha al-Fitrah wa Qararat-ha al-Shar’iyyah, p. 12 
It is not permissible for a woman to observe a voluntary fast when her husband is present except with his permission, because he has the right to intimacy and intercourse with her. If she fasts and denies him his rights, it is not permissible for her to do that, and her naafil fast is not valid unless she does it with his permission. 
Al-Muntaqa min Fataawa al-Shaykh al-Fawzaan, 4/73, 74 
4 – Fulfilling the husband’s rights, raking care of the house and raising the children are all duties of the wife. The husband may think that there is a conflict between these duties and observing naafil fasts. It is well known that women – and some men –when they fast, become tired and neglect their household duties, hence it is required for them to seek permission to observe naafil fasts, but not obligatory fasts. 
5 – The husband usually goes out to work and earns a living, unlike the wife whose work is in the home. It is not prescribed for the husband to ask permission because there is no need for that, unlike the woman who has to ask permission. 
Whatever the case, the commands and prohibitions of sharee’ah are all wise, and the Muslim must say “We hear and we obey.” The basic principle is that rulings apply equally to both men and women except in cases where Allaah has differentiated between them for a reason that has to do with the nature of women or to test people so that the sincere believer may be distinguished from other people.

She has another boyfriend who is married and she used to tell him about her worries. She fell in love with him and cannot keep away from him. He promised her that he would divorce his wife and marry her, but his mother refuses to let him divorce his wife and marry her. Now she is going out with him.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
      Firstly: 

    You have to repent and seek forgiveness, and regret what you 
    have done by getting in touch with men who are not your mahrams, and 
    speaking to them and going out with them. 

    You must also cut off all ties with this second man 
    immediately, with no hesitation, because the relationship between you is 
    haraam.  

    How can you accept to be the cause of his divorcing his wife? 
    If you were in her position, would you accept for your husband to divorce 
    you in order to marry another woman who has come between you to spoil your 
    lives? 

    Secondly: 

    We do not know how a wise man could agree to marry a woman 
    when he knows that she has had a haraam relationship with a man before him 
    and she has not repented from that relationship. 

    Whatever happened to chastity and protective jealousy? Does 
    he not fear that this man may come back into her life again? 

    To put it bluntly, either this woman has repented or she has 
    not. If she has repented from those relationships then there can never be 
    any contact or relationship between them except in marriage. In this case 
    there is nothing wrong with marrying her, but he should obey his mother, and 
    not divorce his first wife. 

    If she has not repented from these actions, then it is not 
    unlikely that she may form a relationship with a third man and a fourth. 

    Similarly, in your case, how can you agree to marry a man who 
    is content to form haraam relationships, speaking and meeting with women? If 
    he has repented, then there can never be any meetings between you, and if he 
    has not repented, then a man like that cannot be trusted. His aim may be 
    just to have fun with you, and even if he is sincere in wanting to marry 
    you, there is nothing that would stop him from forming haraam relationships 
    with other women. 

    Hence you have to cut off all ties without hesitating, and 
    pray for forgiveness from Allaah for wasting your life in haraam pursuits. 
    Turn to Allaah and ask Him to purify your heart and to remove all traces of 
    those haraam relationships which have corrupted your heart and mind, let 
    alone detracted from your religious commitment. 

    If you are sincere in repenting there is the hope that Allaah 
    will bless you with someone better than him, and will make it easy for you 
    to get married to a chaste and righteous man who will treat you in a decent 
    manner and help you to attain the pleasure of your Lord, and you and he will 
    form a believing family and produce good and righteous offspring. 

    Do not pay any attention to your heart and emotions, for in 
    this case emotion has overpowered reason and religious commitment, and has 
    harmed your spiritual and worldly interests. Your heart now is sick so you 
    should not let it lead you to Hell. 

    Seek the help of Allaah, for He will not let down the one who 
    seeks His help, and the one who humbles himself before his Lord will never 
    lose out. Do a lot of righteous deeds, and seek righteous, believing female 
    friends who can help you to deal with your worries and help you to obey your 
    Lord.

      relative is both charity and upholding the ties of kinship. But if these 
      relatives are among those on whom you are obliged to spend, then it is not 
      permissible for you to give your zakaah to them.

    Spending on your brother is obligatory for your father, but 
    if your father is not able to spend on him, it is permissible for you to 
    give your zakaah to him.  

    The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked: 

    My father died (may Allaah have mercy on him), and left 
    behind a family of seven people, including another wife besides my mother. 
    They do not have any source of support apart from Allaah. Is it permissible 
    to regard what I spend on them of my own money as zakaah, knowing that I am 
    married and support another family of my own? 

    Secondly: I have an older brother who is married and has two 
    wives, and he has a lot of children and can hardly afford to look after 
    them. He often asks me for help. Is it permissible to regard what I send to 
    him as zakaah? 

    They replied: 

    There is no reason why you should not send zakaah to your 
    siblings through your father, both males and females, in the future, if they 
    are poor and do not have sufficient wealth to render them in no need of 
    zakaah. Similarly it is permissible for you to send zakaah in the future to 
    your older brother if he is poor and has no wealth or earnings to render him 
    in no need of zakaah, because of the general meaning of the verse on zakaah, 
    in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“As-Sadaqaat (here it 
    means Zakaah) are only for the Fuqaraa’ (poor), and Al‑Masaakeen (the poor) 
    and those employed to collect (the funds); and to attract the hearts of 
    those who have been inclined (towards Islam); and to free the captives; and 
    for those in debt; and for Allaah’s Cause (i.e. for Mujaahidoon — those 
    fighting in a holy battle), and for the wayfarer (a traveller who is cut off 
    from everything); a duty imposed by Allaah. And Allaah is All-Knower, 
    All-Wise”

    [al-Tawbah 9:60]

    ‘Afeefi, Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Ghadyaan. 

    Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 
    10/57, 58. 

    Elsewhere they said: 
It is permissible for 
    you to give to your half siblings and wife’s father zakaah that will suffice 
    them, if their income is not sufficient for them. 

    Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 
    10/59 

    Shaykh Muhamamd al-Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have 
    mercy on him) said: 
With regard to your 
    question as to whether it is permissible to give zakaah to a half-brother or 
    full sister, the answer is that if giving zakaah to them  involves waiving 
    something that is a duty for you, such as if it is obligatory for you to 
    spend on them, and you give them zakaah so that you will not have to spend 
    on them and can save money, that is not permissible, because zakaah cannot 
    be a means to avoid spending. But if it does not, such as if you are not 
    obliged to spend on a person, because you are not one of his heirs, or 
    because you cannot afford to spend on him as well as your own family, or you 
    give it to him to pay off a debt that he owes and cannot repay, then it is 
    permissible for you to give your zakaah to him, and indeed that is better 
    than giving it to someone else, because giving it is both charity and 
    upholding the ties of kinship.

What is the best way to call them to fast?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.What should be done is to call these Muslims to fast and encourage them to do so, and warn them against being heedless and negligent. This may be done in the following ways: 
1 – Informing them that it is obligatory to fast, and telling them of its great importance in Islam, for it is one of the great pillars upon which Islam is built. 
2 – Reminding them of the immense reward which comes from fasting, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever fasts Ramadaan out of faith and in the hope of reward, his previous sins will be forgiven.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 38; Muslim, 760. 
And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever believes in Allaah and His Messenger, and establishes regular prayer and fasts Ramadaan, it will be his due that Allaah will admit him to Paradise, whether he strives in jihad for the sake of Allaah or stays in the land in which he was born.” They said: “O Messenger of Allaah, should we not give these glad tidings to the people?” He said: “In Paradise there are one hundred levels which Allaah has prepared for those who strive in jihad for the sake of Allaah, and the distance between each two levels is like the distance between the heaven and the earth. When you ask of Allaah, ask him for al-Firdaws, for it is in the middle of Paradise, the highest part of Paradise. Above it is the Throne of the Most Merciful and from it spring forth the rivers of Paradise.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 7423. 
And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah says: ‘Fasting is for Me and I shall reward for it. He gives up his desire and his food and drink for My sake. Fasting is a shield, and the fasting person has two moments of joy, one when he breaks his fast and one when he meets his Lord. And the odour that comes from the mouth of a fasting person is better before Allaah than the fragrance of musk.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 7492; Muslim, 1151. 
3 – Warning the one who does not fast, and explaining that this is a major sin. Ibn Khuzaymah (1986) and Ibn Hibbaan (7491) narrated that Abu Umaamah al-Baahili (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “Whilst I was sleeping, two men came to me and took hold of my upper arm, and brought me to a rugged mountain. They said: ‘Climb up.’ I said: ‘I cannot do it.’ They said: ‘We will make it easy for you.’ So I climbed up until I was at the top of the mountain. There I heard loud voices. I said: ‘What are these voices?’ They said: ‘This is the screaming of the people of Hell.’ Then I was taken and I saw people suspended by their ankles, with the corners of their mouths torn and pouring with blood. I said: ‘Who are these?’ They said: ‘These are the people who broke their fast before it was time to do so.’” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Mawaarid al-Zam’aan, 1509. 
Al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) commented: I say: This is the punishment of the one who fasted then deliberately broke his fast before the time for iftaar had come. So how about one who does not fast at all? We ask Allaah to keep us safe and sound in this world and in the Hereafter. 
See also question no. 38747. 
5 – Explaining how easy and straightforward fasting is, and the joy and contentment that there is in it, and how it brings peace of mind, as well as the joy and delight in worship during the days and nights of the fast, by reading Qur’aan and praying qiyaam. 
6 – Inviting them to listen to some lectures and read some books that speak of the fast and its importance and discuss various issues of fasting. 
7 – Not getting bored or tired of calling them and reminding them, speaking in a kind and gentle manner, as well as praying sincerely for them to be guided and forgiven.

When is it haram for a traveller to break his fast?","Praise be to Allah.Fasting while travelling: Permissible?
The Quran and Sunnah, and the consensus of the ummah, indicate that a person who is travelling during the day in Ramadan is allowed not to fast . Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number [of days which one did not observe Sawm (fasts) must be made up] from other days” [al-Baqarah 2:185]
The jurists (may Allah have mercy on them) stated that the traveller who is allowed not to fast is one who is travelling the distance at which it becomes permissible to shorten the prayers, and is travelling for a permissible purpose. 
If a person is travelling a distance shorter than that at which it becomes permissible to shorten the prayers or he is travelling for sinful purposes, then it is not permissible to shorten the prayers . The same applies to one who travels in order to be able to break the fast : it is haram for him to travel and to break the fast. 
How many miles do you have to travel to break your fast?
According to the majority of scholars, the distance at which it becomes permissible to shorten the prayers is four stages, which is equivalent to approximately 80 kilometers. Some scholars are of the view that it cannot be reckoned by distance, but is rather what the people describe as travelling. 
Can you break your fast if you are traveling for sinful purposes?
The view that the one who is traveling for sinful purposes is not allowed to break his fast or avail himself of any of the other concessions granted to travellers, such as shortening the prayers, is the view of the Malikis, Shafi`is and Hanbalis. (See al-Mughni, 2/52) 
They gave the reason for that as being that being allowed to break the fast (whilst travelling) is a concession, and the one who is travelling for sinful purposes does not deserve any concession. Some of them quoted as evidence the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“But if one is forced by necessity without willful disobedience nor transgressing due limits, then there is no sin on him.” [al-Baqarah 2:173]
The point here is that Allah has not permitted the eating of dead meat to those who are willfully disobedient or who transgress the limits, because they are sinners. They said: The one who is willfully disobedient is the one who rebels against the ruler, and the one who transgresses the limits is the one who rebels against society and commits highway robbery (like a bandit). 
The Hanafis are of the view that the one who travels for sinful purposes is allowed to break the fast, shorten the prayers and so on. This is also the view favoured by Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him).  (See al-Bahr al-Raiq, 2/149; Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 24/110 )
They did not agree with the majority’s use of this verse as evidence. They said: The one who is willfully disobedient is the one who seeks haram food despite the fact that he is able to obtain halal food, and the one who transgresses the limits is the one who takes more than he needs. 
Can you break your fast if you travel just to break the fast?
With regard to the one who travels in order to break the fast, he is trying to find ways around the rulings of shari’ah, so he should be punished by being denied the concession. 
It says in Kashshaf al-Qina’, 2/312, which is a Hanbali book: 
“But if he travels in order to break the fast, they both become haram for him, i.e., travelling and breaking the fast, because there is no reason for his travelling except breaking the fast. It is haram for him to break the fast because he has no legitimate reason to allow him to do that, and it is haram for him to travel because it is a means to break the fast in a haram manner.” 
When can a traveller start breaking his fast?
The traveller does not have the right to break his fast except after he has left behind the built-up area of his city or village. It is haram to break his fast before that, because he is still a non-traveller in that case. 
When is it haram for a traveller to break his fast?
Based on this, it is haram for a traveller to break his fast in several cases, including the following: 

When he is travelling but the distance does not reach the distance at which it becomes permissible to shorten the prayers.
When his journey is not permissible according to the majority of scholars.
When he is travelling in order to break the fast.
When he is travelling and wants to break the fast before leaving the houses of his village or city.
There is a fifth case in which it is haram for a traveller to break the fast according to the majority of scholars. That is when he is staying in the place to which he has traveled for more than four days . Other scholars say that the concessions of travel apply to the traveller no matter how long he stays.

50762,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50762,If a pregnant woman feels a bit tired can she break her fast?,Can a pregnant woman break her fast in Ramadan if she feels a bit tired?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.It should be noted that not every kind of tiredness or hardship is regarded as an excuse which makes it permissible not to fast in Ramadaan, because fasting is not free of some tiredness and hardship, but in most cases it is a small-scale, ordinary kind of hardship. 
Based on this, if a pregnant woman feels a little bit tired, one of the following two scenarios must apply: 
1 – when she feels a little tired but it does not cause intense, extraordinary hardship, and she does not fear for herself or her unborn child. In this case she is obliged to fast and it is not permissible for her to break the fast. 
2 – when the hardship experienced is severe and she fears that she or her unborn child may be harmed. In this case it is better for her not to fast, and that may be obligatory for her. 
See also questions no. 3434 and 50005. 
The fact that a pregnant woman is permitted not to fast is indicated by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Allaah has waived half of the prayer and fasting from the traveller, and from pregnant and breastfeeding women.” Narrated by al-Nasaa’i, 2274; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan al-Nasaa’i. 
If a pregnant woman does not fast, then she is obliged to make up the days when she did not fast. Does she also have to feed poor people for the days when she did not fast because she feared for her unborn child? There is a difference of opinion among the fuqaha’ concerning that. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, when discussing the differences of scholarly opinion concerning what a pregnant woman must do if she does not fast: 
The third view is that she has to make up the fasts only and does not have to feed poor people. This is the most correct view in my opinion, because the situation of pregnant and breastfeeding women is no different to that of sick people and travellers, so they have to make up the fasts only.

50763,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50763,She made her husband angry – will that detract from the reward for her fast?,"If I make my husband angry, does that detract from the reward for my fast?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
      Firstly: 

    The relationship between husband and wife should be based on 
    good and kind treatment, love and compassion. 

    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And among His Signs is 
    this, that He created for you wives from among yourselves, that you may find 
    repose in them, and He has put between you affection and mercy. Verily, in 
    that are indeed signs for a people who reflect”

    [al-Room 30:21] 

    “and live with them honourably”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:19] 

    “And they (women) have rights (over their husbands as 
    regards living expenses) similar (to those of their husbands) over them (as 
    regards obedience and respect) to what is reasonable”

    [al-Baqarah 2:228]

    Based on this, each spouse should be keen to please the other 
    and not do anything that will cause anger or annoyance. 

    It was narrated that Imam Ahmad (may Allaah be pleased with 
    him) said: Umm Saalih [his wife] stayed with me for twenty years and she and 
    I did not argue at all. 

    Allaah has enjoined upon spouses everything that will create 
    and strengthen love between them, and He has forbidden to them everything 
    that goes against that. 

    If the two spouses understand this principle which governs 
    how they should interact with one another, then their life will be well 
    ordered and it will be as Allaah wants to it be, filled with tranquility, 
    love and compassion. 

    Each spouse is enjoined by Islam to do everything that will 
    create and strengthen love, and is forbidden to do whatever is contrary to 
    that. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade a 
    man to pray and fast a great deal if that will impact upon his wife’s 
    rights. 

    Al-Bukhaari (1153) narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Amr (may 
    Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said to me: “Have I not heard that you spend all night 
    in prayer and fast every day?” I said: “I do that.” He said: “But if you do 
    that, your eyes will become weak and you will become tired. But your body 
    has rights over you and your wife has rights over you. So fast and break 
    your fast, pray qiyaam and sleep.” 

    Secondly:

    The person who fasts is commanded to behave well, and the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) enjoined the 
    fasting person not to respond in kind if someone wants to fight him or 
    insults him. Rather he should be patient and restrain himself, and say, “I 
    am fasting.” 

    Al-Bukhaari (1894) and Muslim (1151) narrated from Abu 
    Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Fasting is a shield, so 
    (the one who is fasting) should not utter obscenities or behave in an 
    ignorant manner. If someone wants to fight him or insults him, let him say, 
    ‘I am fasting’ twice.” 

    Al-Nawawi said: “Rafth (translated here as obscenities) means 
    foolish and immoral speech. And ignorance is close to obscenity, and is 
    contrary to wisdom and what is right, whether that is words or deeds. 

    It should be noted that this prohibition on obscenity, 
    ignorance, arguing and insulting is not limited only to those who are 
    fasting, rather the prohibition applies to everyone, but is emphasized more 
    in the case of one who is fasting. And Allaah knows best.”   

    Al-Haakim narrated and classed as saheeh a report from Abu 
    Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him), who said: The Messenger of Allaah 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Fasting is not only 
    (abstention) from food and drink, rather fasting is (abstention) from idle 
    and obscene talk. If someone insults you or treats you in an ignorant 
    manner, then say: ‘I am fasting, I am fasting.’” Classed as saheeh by 
    al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 5376. Idle talk is false talk, or it 
    was said that it means speech in which there is no benefit. 

    Al-Bukhaari (6057) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “Whoever does not give up false speech and acting upon it, 
    Allaah has no need of his giving up his food and drink.” 

    Al-Haafiz said: 

    This was understood to mean that these actions detract from 
    the fast. 

    Al-Subki al-Kabeer said: The fact that these things are 
    mentioned in this hadeeth draws attention to two things: 

    1-That they are worse when done 
    during the fast than at other times

    2-That we should strive to ensure 
    that the fast is free of such things, and that if the fast is free of them, 
    this is a sign that the fast is more complete.

    The strength of the words implies that these things are 
    regarded as abhorrent because of the fast, which implies that the fast is 
    more complete if it is free of such things. He said: If it is not free of 
    such things it is imperfect. 

    End quote from Fath al-Baari. 
Thirdly: 

    The husband’s rights over his wife are great. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “but men have a degree (of responsibility) over them”

    [al-Baqarah 2:228]
If the husband is angry 
    with her because she is refusing to share his bed, then her sin is even 
    worse, because of the report narrated by Ibn Khuzaymah in his Saheeh 
    from ‘Ata’ ibn Dinar al-Hudhali, according to which the Messenger of Allaah 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There are three 
    whose prayers will not be accepted and they will not ascend to heaven or 
    even go beyond their heads: … a woman whose husband calls her at night and 
    she refuses.” This hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh 
    al-Targheeb wa’l-Tarheeb, 485. 

    It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with 
    him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “If a man calls his wife to his bed and she refuses, and he 
    stays angry with her all night, the angels will curse her until morning.” 
    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3237; Muslim, 1436. 

    In the answer to question no. 
    50063, we explained that sin 
    detracts from the reward for fasting, and that sins may be so many that they 
    erase the reward for fasting altogether. 

    If one spouse falls short in his or her duties towards the 
    other, or makes him or her angry, that will be a cause of the fast being 
    imperfect. 

    This applies so long as the other spouse is not angry for no 
    reason, for some spouses get angry for no reason, and some get angry because 
    the wife is righteous, so his anger is unjustified. We ask Allaah to keep us 
    safe and sound.

      being has more knowledge of his Creator than the Messenger of Allaah

“And follow not (O man, 
    i.e., say not, or do not, or witness not) that of which you have no

[al-Isra’ 17:36]

    The spirit or soul is not one of the attributes of Allaah, rather it is one 
    of the things that have been created by Allaah. It is mentioned in 
    conjunction with Allaah in some texts by way of honouring, for Allaah is its 
    Creator and Sovereign, He takes it (in death) whenever He wills and He sends 
    it whenever He wills. 
What we say about the 
    spirit is the same as what we say about the “House of Allaah”, the 
    “she-camel of Allaah”, the “slaves of Allaah” and the “Messenger of Allaah”. 
    All of these created things are mentioned in conjunction with Allaah by way 
    of honouring. 
Among the texts in which 
    the spirit is mentioned in conjunction with Allaah is the verse 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Then He fashioned him 
    in due proportion, and breathed into him the soul [lit. “His soul”] (created 
    by Allaah for that person)” 
[al-Sajdah 32:9] 
    
This is speaking of Adam 
    (peace be upon him). 
Allaah also says concerning 
    Adam (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So, 
    when I have fashioned him completely and breathed into him (Adam) the soul 
    which I created for him  [lit. “My soul”], then fall (you) down prostrating 
    yourselves unto him”
[al-Hijr 15:29]
And Allaah says: 

    “She placed a screen (to screen herself) from them; then We 
    sent to her Our Ruh [angel Jibreel (Gabriel)], and he appeared before her in 
    the form of a man in all respects.

    18. She said: ‘Verily, I seek refuge with the Most Gracious 
    (Allaah) from you, if you do fear Allaah.’

    19. (The angel) said: ‘I am only a messenger from your Lord, 
    (to announce) to you the gift of a righteous son.’”

    [Maryam 19:17-19]
Here the word “rooh” 
    (spirit) refers to the slave and Messenger of Allaah Jibreel, whom He sent 
    to Maryam. Allaah mentions him here in conjunction with Himself in the 
    phrase roohuna (Our rooh or spirit) by way of honouring him. Here He 
    is mentioning a created being in conjunction with his Creator. 
In the lengthy hadeeth 
    about intercession it says: “Then Moosa will come and will say: ‘I am not 
    able for it; rather go to ‘Eesa for he is the spirit of (i.e., created by) 
    Allaah and a Word from Him.’” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 7510; Muslim, 193.  
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn 
    Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Simply mentioning something in 
    conjunction with Allaah does not mean that that thing is a Divine attribute, 
    rather specific created things may be mentioned in conjunction with Allaah 
    and their attributes are not divine attributes, according to scholarly 
    consensus – as in the phrases, “the House of Allaah”, the “she-camel of 
    Allaah”, the “slaves of Allaah”. The same also applies to the phrase “the 
    spirit (rooh) of Allaah” according to the earliest generations of the 
    Muslims and their imams and their common folk. But if something that is one 
    of His attributes and is not an attribute shared by anyone else is mentioned 
    in conjunction with Him, such as the Speech of Allaah, the Knowledge of Allaah, the Hand of Allaah, and so on, then this is one of His attributes.

1 – Entities which exist 
    separately. These are mentioned in conjunction with Allaah by way of 
    honouring, such as the House of Allaah and the she-camel of Allaah, and also 
    the spirit (rooh) of Allaah, which is not a divine attribute, rather it is 
    something that exists separately. Hence the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, according to the lengthy hadeeth of 
    al-Bara’ ibn ‘Aazib which describes how man dies and his soul or spirit 
    (rooh) comes out: “It comes out flowing like a drop of water from the mouth 
    of a vessel… and he (the Angel of Death) takes it, and when he takes it they 
    (the angels) do not leave it in his hand for an instant but they take it and 
    put it in that shroud with that perfume… and there comes out from it a smell 
    like the finest fragrance of musk on the face of the earth, and they ascend 
    with it…” 
See the report of this 
    hadeeth in Ahkaam al-Janaa’iz ib by al-Albaani, p. 198 
The Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When the soul (rooh) is taken, the 
    eyes follow it.” Narrated by Muslim, 920. In other words, when the soul is 
    taken the eyes follow it, watching to see where it goes. All of this 
    indicates that the soul is something that exists separately.  
2 – Attributes that do not 
    exist separately, rather they need an entity to belong to, such as 
    knowledge, will and power. If it is said, “the Knowledge of Allaah”, the 
    “Will of Allaah” and so on, this is mentioning the attribute in conjunction 
    with the One to Whom it belongs. 
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah 
    have mercy on him) said in his book al-Rooh: 
… Does the rooh exist from 
    eternity or is it something that is created? 
Then he said: This is an 
    issue which some scholars got wrong and many groups of the sons of Adam went 
    astray concerning it, but Allaah has guided the followers of His Messenger 
    to the clear truth concerning it. The Messengers (blessings and peace be 
    upon them) are unanimously agreed that the soul is created and taught and 
    trained. This is a basic belief in the religion of the Messengers (blessings 
    and peace be upon them), just as it is a basic belief in their religion that 
    the universe is created, and that physical bodies will be resurrected, and 
    that Allaah alone is the Creator and everything besides Him is created. 
Then he quoted al-Haafiz 
    Muhammad ibn Nasr al-Marwazi as saying: There is no dispute among the 
    Muslims concerning the fact that the souls (arwaah) that are in Adam and his 
    sons and ‘Eesa and other sons of Adam are all created by Allaah, who created 
    them and fashioned them and made them, then He mentioned them in conjunction 
    with Himself as He mentioned all His creation in conjunction with Himself, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And has subjected to 
    you all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth”
[al-Jaathiyah 45:13]

    End quote from al-Rooh, p. 144 

    Some people may be confused about what Allaah says about ‘Eesa (peace be 
    upon him) in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The Messiah ‘Eesa 
    (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), was (no more than) a Messenger of Allaah and 
    His Word, (“Be!” — and he was) which He bestowed on Maryam (Mary) and a 
    spirit (Rooh) created by Him [lit. from Him]”
[al-Nisa’ 4:171]
They think, as the 
    Christians do, that the word min (lit. from) implies being part of 
    Him and that the Rooh (spirit) is a part of Allaah. In fact the word min 
    here implies that this Spirit comes from Allaah, its starting point and 
    origin is with Allaah, because He is its Creator and Controller. 
Ibn Katheer (may Allaah 
    have mercy on him) said: 
The words in the verse and 
    hadeeth, “a Spirit (Rooh) from Him” are like the verse (interpretation of 
    the meaning): 

    “And has subjected to you all that is in the heavens and 
    all that is in the earth; it is all as a favour and kindness from Him”

    [al-Jaathiyah 45:13]

    “From Him” means that it is created by Him and comes from 
    Him, not from Him in the sense of being part of Him, as the Christians say. 
    Rather it is referring to the starting point of that soul, as in the first 
    verse quoted. Mujaahid said that the phrase “And a Spirit from Him” means a 
    Messenger from Him. Others said that it means love from Him, but the former 
    is more correct, which is that he is a created being from a created soul, 
    and the soul is mentioned in conjunction with Allaah by way of honouring, 
    just as the she-camel and the House are mentioned in conjunction with Allaah 
    in other verses (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “This she‑camel of Allaah is a sign unto you”

    [al-A’raaf 7:73] 

    “and sanctify My House for those who circumambulate it”

    [al-Hajj 22:26]
And it says in the saheeh 
    hadeeth: “Enter upon my Lord in His House”; it is mentioned in conjunction 
    with Allaah by way of honouring. All of this is of the same type and comes 
    under one heading. 

    End quote from Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 1/784 
Al-Aloosi (may Allaah 
    have mercy on him) said: It is narrated that a skilled Christian doctor of 
    al-Rasheed debated with ‘Ali ibn al-Husayn al-Waaqidi al-Marwazi one day and 
    said to him: “In your Book there is something which indicates that ‘Eesa 
    (peace be upon him) is part of Allaah,” and he recited this verse to him 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “The Messiah ‘Eesa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), was (no 
    more than) a Messenger of Allaah and His Word, (“Be!” — and he was) which He 
    bestowed on Maryam (Mary) and a spirit (Rooh) created by Him [lit. 
    from Him]”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:171]

    Al-Waaqidi recited the verse (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “And has subjected to you all that is in the heavens and 
    all that is in the earth; it is all as a favour and kindness from Him”

    [al-Jaathiyah 45:13]

    and said: Then that means that all things must also be a part 
    of Him, exalted and glorified be He. The Christian ceased his arguments and 
    became Muslim, and al-Rasheed rejoiced greatly. 

    And he said (may Allaah have mercy on him): The Christians 
    have no proof for their claim to be honouring ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) with 
    regard to the Spirit being mentioned in conjunction with God, because this 
    is also mentioned with regard to things other than him. In the Gospel of 
    Luke it says that Jesus said to his disciples:  
“…how much more will your 
    Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him”

    Luke 11:13 (NIV) 
In the Gospel of Matthew 
    it says that John the Baptist was filled with the Holy Spirit when he was in 
    his mother’s womb. 

    In the Old Testament it says that God said to Moses:  

    “Bring me seventy of Israel's elders … I will take of the 
    Spirit that is on you and put the Spirit on them.” 

    Numbers 11:16-17 (NIV) 

    It also says concerning Joseph:  

    “So Pharaoh asked them, ‘Can we find anyone like this man, 
    one in whom is the spirit of God?’” 

    Genesis 41:38 (NIV) 
It also says in the Old 
    Testament that the spirit of God descended upon Daniel… and there are other 
    such verses. 

    End quote from Rooh al-Ma’aani, 6/25. 

    It says in the Gospel of Luke: 

    “and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit”

    Luke 1:41 (NIV) 
“Now there was a man in 
    Jerusalem called Simeon, who was righteous and devout. He was waiting for 
    the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him. 
It had been revealed to 
    him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lord's 
    Christ [Messiah]. 
Moved by the Spirit, he 
    went into the temple courts”
Luke 2:25-27 (NIV) 

    This clearly shows that the Spirit is an angel who brings 
    revelation, and that ‘Eesa (peace be upon him), the “Lord’s Christ (i.e., 
    Messiah)” is a servant of God. God is the One Who anointed him and made him 
    the Christ or Messiah.

50781,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50781,Is it essential to recite the Quran in sequence for one who wants to complete it?,"In Ramadaan, if a person wants to complete the Quran, does he have to recite it in sequence?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is mustahabb to read Quran a great deal during Ramadaan, because it is the month of the Quran. Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Quran, a guidance for mankind and clear proofs for the guidance and the criterion (between right and wrong)” [al-Baqarah 2:185].
Jibreel used to come to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) every night in Ramadaan and review the Quran with him. Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5) and Muslim (4268). 
Al-Bukhaari (4614) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that Jibreel used to review the Quran with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) once every year, and he reviewed it with him twice in the year when he died. This indicates that it is mustahabb to complete the Quran and study it in Ramadaan.
 Hence the salaf used to read Quran a great deal during Ramadaan, following the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Qataadah (may Allah have mercy on him) used to complete the Quran every seven nights all the time, and every three nights in Ramadaan, and every two nights during the last ten days of Ramadaan.  
Ibraaheem al-Nakha’i used to complete the Quran in Ramadaan every three nights, and in the last ten days every two nights. 
Al-Aswad (may Allah have mercy on him) used to read the entire Quran every two nights throughout the month. End quote from Majaalis Shahr Ramadaan by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) p. 65. 
Secondly: 
The best is to read the Quran in the order of soorahs as given in the Mus-haf, which is the sequence in which Jibreel reviewed the Quran with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) at the end of his life.  
See: al-Tahbeer fi ‘Ilm al-Tafseer by al-Suyooti, p. 637 
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Tibyaan: 
The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) said: The best is to read it in the order in which it appears in the Mus-haf, so he should read al-Faatihah, then al-Baqarah, then Aal ‘Imraan, then al-Nisa’, until he ends with Qul a’oodhu bi Rabbi l-naas (Sooratal-Naas), whether he is reciting it in prayer or otherwise. It is also mustahabb, if he recites one soorah, to recite after it the soorah that comes after it. So if he recites Qul a’oodhu bi Rabbi l-naas (Sooratal-Naas) in the first rak’ah, he should recite from al-Baqarah in the second. 
The evidence for that is that the order of soorahs given in the Mus-haf is for a reason, so that order should be followed, except in cases where it is narrated that there is an exception, such as in Fajr prayer on Friday, when Alif-Laam-Meem Tanzeel (Soorat al-Sajdah) is recited in the first rak’ah and Hal ata (Soorat al-Insaan) in the second, and the Eid prayers when Soorat Qaaf and Soorat al-Qamar may be recited. 
If he recites them in a different order and recites one soorah then recites a soorah that comes before it, or he recites a soorah that does not come straight after it, that is permissible, even if he is not doing what is best. As for reciting a soorah from the end to the beginning, there is no dispute that this is not allowed and is blameworthy, because it is a distortion that detracts from the linguistic miracle of the Quran and goes against the wisdom behind the order in which the verses appear. 
End quote from al-Nawawi. 
There is a report from ‘Aa’ishah which indicates that it is not obligatory to read Quran in sequence. 
Al-Bukhaari (4993) narrated that Yoosuf ibn Maahak said: I was with ‘Aa’ishah the Mother of the Believers when an Iraqi came to her and said: “O Mother of the Believers, show me your Mus-haf.” She said: “Why?” He said: “So that I may compile and arrange the Quran according to it, for people recite it with its soorahs not in proper order.” She said: “It does not matter which part you read first. The first part of it to be revealed was a soorah from al-Mufassal which mentioned Paradise and Hell, then when the people became steadfast in Islam, (rulings on) halaal and haraam were revealed. If the first thing to have been revealed was ‘Do not drink wine,’ they would have said: ‘We will never give up wine.’ If it had been revealed, ‘Do not commit zina,’ they would have said, ‘We will never give up zina.’ It was revealed in Makkah to Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when I was a young girl playing, ‘Nay, but the Hour is their appointed time (for their full recompense), and the Hour will be more grievous and more bitter’ [al-Qamar 54:46]. And Soorat al-Baqarah and al-Nisa’ were not revealed except I was with him.” 
Al-Haafiz said: 
It seems to me that this Iraqi was one of those who followed the recitation of Ibn Mas’ood. When the Mus-haf of ‘Uthmaan was brought to Kufa, Ibn Mas’ood did not agree to recant his recitation or destroy his Mus-haf, and his compilation was different from that of ‘Uthmaan’s Mus-haf. (Compilation means the collection of the Mus-haf in order). Undoubtedly the compilation of ‘Uthmaan’s Mus-haf was more appropriate than any other, hence this Iraqi said that its soorahs were not in proper order. 
Ibn Battaal said: We do not know of anyone who regarded it as obligatory to recite the soorahs in order, whether during prayer or otherwise, rather it is permissible to recite al-Kahf before al-Baqarah, or al-Hajj before al-Kahf, for example. As for what is narrated from the salaf about it being forbidden to recite the Quran out of order, what is meant by that is reciting a soorah from its end to its beginning. There was a group which did that in poetry, to demonstrate their precise memorization thereof. So the salaf ruled that this is not allowed with regard to the Quran and it is haraam. Al-Qaadi ‘Iyaad said: The order of soorahs is not obligatory when reading or praying, or studying or teaching, hence Mus-hafs varied, but when the Mus-haf of ‘Uthmaan was written they wrote it in the order in which it appears now. Hence the order of the Mus-hafs of the Sahaabah varied… then he mentioned something similar to Ibn Battaal. End quote from Fath al-Baari.

50784,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50784,Can You Shave during Ramadan?,Does shaving the beard during the day in Ramadan invalidate the fast? May Allah keep us and all the Muslims from shaving their beard.,"Shaving the beard during Ramadan does not break the fast, but it does detract from the reward of the fasting person.","Is shaving the beard haram?


Can you shave your beard during Ramadan?


Things to avoid while fasting","Praise be to Allah.Is shaving the beard haram?
It is haram for men to shave their beards during Ramadan and at other times. This is because of the sahih ahadith which clearly enjoin allowing the beard to grow . 
For example, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Be different from the mushrikin: let your beards grow and trim your moustaches .” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5892; Muslim, 259)
And he said: “Trim the moustache and let the beard grow; be different from the Magians.” (Narrated by Muslim, 260)
The great scholar Ibn Muflih (may Allah have mercy on him) said:  
“Ibn Hazm stated that there was scholarly consensus saying that trimming the moustache and letting the beard grow are obligatory.” (Al-Furu’, 1/130)
Can you shave your beard during Ramadan?
Shaving the beard is not one of the things that break the fast, but it does detract from the reward of the fasting person. The same applies to other sins such as lying, backbiting, and so on. 
Things to avoid while fasting
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Does engaging in haram kinds of speech during the day in Ramadan invalidate a person’s fast? 
He replied: 
If we read the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Observing As-Sawm (the fasting) is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, that you may become Al-Muttaqun (the pious).” [al-Baqarah 2:183], we will understand  that the reason behind the enjoining of fasting is so as to instill piety. Piety means giving up haram things, and in general means doing what is enjoined and abstaining from what is forbidden.  
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does not give up false speech and acting in accordance with it, or ignorance, Allah has no need of his giving up his food and drink.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 6057)
Based on this, it is most important that the fasting person avoids haram words and deeds . So he should not backbite people, tell lies or spread malicious gossip amongst them; he should not engage in haram transactions; and he should avoid all haram things. 
If a person avoids such things for a whole month, then he will remain righteous for the rest of the year. But unfortunately many of those who fast do not differentiate between a day when they are fasting and a day when they are not fasting. 
So they continue to speak and act as they usually do, engaging in haram actions such as lying, cheating and so on. You cannot sense the dignity of fasting in them at all. These actions do not invalidate the fast but they do detract from its reward, and when they are done continually they may cancel the reward of fasting altogether.” (Majmu’ Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin, vol. 19, question no. 233)
