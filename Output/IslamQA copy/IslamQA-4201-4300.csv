4203,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4203,How many will enter Paradise?,"In sahih bukhari, it is mentioned that ...70,000 of all mankind will enter paradise(!!!)
The first three generations of muslims alone probably amounts to 70,000.
Is there another explanation to this hadith?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Perhaps you are referring to the hadith about the seventy thousand who will enter Paradise without being brought to account, which was reported by the two Shaykhs (al-Bukhaari and Muslim), Ahmad and others from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). If you study this hadith and think about it, then in sha Allah the confusion you describe in your question will be resolved.
Imaam al-Bukhaari (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated in his Saheeh from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with them both) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I was shown the nations, and some Prophets passed by with a few followers, and some Prophets passed by with no followers. Then I was shown a great multitude, and I said, ‘What is this? Is this my ummah?’ It was said, ‘No, this is Moosa and his people.’ It was said, ‘Look at the horizon.’ There I saw a huge multitude filling the horizon. And it was said, ‘Look there, and there, on the horizons of the sky.’ There was a multitude filling the horizons. It was said, ‘This is your ummah, and of these, seventy thousand will enter Paradise without being brought to account.’” Then he [the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)] went inside, without explaining further. The people started to discuss what he had said, saying, “We are the ones who have believed in Allah and followed His Messenger; we are they” or, “It is our children who were born in Islam whilst we were born in Jaahiliyyah.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) heard about what was being said, so he came out and said: “They are the ones who do not seek ruqya, do not believe in bad omens and do not use cauterization; they put their trust in their Lord…”
What the hadith means is that there is a group of this ummah who will enter Paradise without being brought to account, not that the number of inhabitants of Paradise from this ummah is seventy thousand. The seventy thousand referred to in this hadith are of a high status in this ummah because of some special qualities that they have, as mentioned in the hadith: “They are the ones who do not seek ruqya, do not believe in bad omens and do not use cauterization; they put their trust in their Lord…”
The reason why they will enter Paradise without being brought to account and without being punished is stated clearly in another report narrated by al-Bukhaari (may Allah have mercy on him) from Ibn ‘Abbaas, who said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘I was shown the nations. One Prophet passed by with a group, another passed by with a small band, another with ten followers, another with five, and another on his own (with no followers). I looked and saw a huge multitude, and I said, “O Jibreel, are these my ummah?” He said “No, but look at the horizon.” So I looked and saw a huge multitude. He said, “These are your ummah, and these are seventy thousand at their head who will not be brought to account or punished.” I said, “How come?” He said, “They do not use cauterization, or seek ruqya, or believe in bad omens; they put their trust in their Lord.”’ ‘Ukhaashah ibn Mihsan stood up and said, ‘Pray to Allah to make me one of them!’ He [the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)] said, ‘O Allaah, make him one of them.’ Then another man stood up and said, ‘Pray to Allah to make me one of them.’ He said, ‘ ‘Ukaashah has beaten you to it.’”
(Saheeh al-Bukhaari, 6059).
They are described further in another hadith, narrated by Sahl ibn Sa’d (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Seventy thousand or seven hundred thousand [one of the narrators was not sure] of my ummah will enter Paradise, and the first of them will not enter until the last of them do so. And their faces will be like the moon on the night when it is full.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari).
Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: ‘A group of my ummah seventy thousand strong will enter Paradise, with their faces shining like the moon.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari).
Muslim also reported about them in his Saheeh from Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah: “… then the believers will be saved and the first group to be saved will have faces like the moon when it is full, [they will be] seventy thousand, who will not be brought to account. Then will come those who shine like the stars in the sky…”
There is good news for all of us Muslims in this hadith and others. There is more information in a report narrated in the Musnad of Imaam Ahmad and the Sunan of al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Maajah, where Abu Umaamah is reported to have said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “My Lord promised me that seventy thousand of my ummah will enter Paradise without being brought to account or being punished; with each thousand of them will be another seventy thousand, plus three handfuls of the handfuls of my Lord, may He be glorified.” We ask Allah to make us among them. Just imagine: seventy thousand, with each thousand of whom is another seventy thousand – how great will be the total number of people who will enter Paradise without being brought to account? How many will be in each handful “scooped up” by the Merciful, Compassionate, Generous Almighty Lord? We ask Allah to make us among that number.
The second item of good news is that the number of inhabitants of Paradise from this ummah will be two thirds of the total number. More people will enter Paradise from the ummah of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) than from all the previous nations combined. This good news comes from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the hadith in which he said to his Companions one day, “Would you be pleased if you were a quarter of the people of Paradise?” They said, “Yes.” He said, “Would you be pleased if you were a third of the people of Paradise?” They said, “Yes.” He said, “Would you be pleased if you were a half of the people of Paradise?” They said, “Yes.” He said, “By the One in Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, I hope that you will be half of the people of Paradise. No one will enter Paradise except a Muslim, and among the people of shirk you are like a white hair on the hide of a black bull, or a black hair on the hide of a red bull.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 6047). The final part of the good news comes in another saheeh hadith, in which he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The people of Paradise are 120 rows, of which eighty are from this ummah and the other forty from all the other nations.” (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 3469; he said this is a hasan hadith). We praise Allah for His blessings and ask Him for His grace and mercy, and to make us dwell in Paradise by His mercy and kindness.

      seven whom Allah will shade on the Day in which there is no shade except Allah's specific just for men or is it for anyone, such as women,
      who perform those acts and, therefore, they will receive that reward mentioned in the
      hadith?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The merits mentioned in the hadith are not specifically for
    men. In fact, they are general for both men and women. If a young woman grows up in the
    worship of Allah, she is included among them. Similarly, two women who love each other for
    the sake of Allah alone are also included. Again, any woman who is invited to illegal
    sexual intercourse by a man of nobility and beauty and she refuses his advances, saying,
    ""I fear Allah,"" will be one of those in the shade of Allah.
Any woman who gives in charity from her legal earnings to the extent that
    her left hand does not know what her right hand has given will be included among them. If
    a woman remembers Allah when she is alone by herself, she will be included among them like
    any man. However, the righteous leader is something specific for men. Similarly,
    performing the prayers in congregation in the mosque is something specific for men. The
    prayer of the woman in her house is more virtuous as has been stated in the authentic
    Hadith of the Prophet (peace be upon him).",Shaikh ibn Baz

Primary and secondary education up to the age of 15/16 may be provided in Muslim schools (which are also very expensive), but as for Higher Education there is no such Islamic Institute.
Even on the secondary school level on the agenda of Curriculum, we do not have books that deal with the branches of knowledge that are available in secular institutes, such as; Political science, Sociology, Psychology, Pedagogy. Please advise on how we should go about bringing about an Islamic Education system for our Youth in the west (bearing in mind that it is near impossible for us to migrate to Arab/Muslim countries because of the restrictions on immigration etc.)",,,"Praise be to Allah.In order to preserve the structure of the Muslim family in the non-Muslim countries, we need to meet a number of conditions and requirements, both within the home and outside it:


Within the home:




It is essential for parents to uphold the habit of praying regularly in the mosque with their children; if there is no mosque nearby, then they must pray in jamaa’ah (congregation) at home.


They have to read Qur’aan and listen to its recitation daily.


They must eat meals together.


They must speak in the language of the Qur’aan as much as they can.


They must uphold the good manners prescribed by the Lord of the Worlds for families and in social settings; these include those that are to be found in Soorat al-Noor.


They should not let themselves or their children watch immoral and corrupt movies and shows.


Their children have to sleep at home and should stay home as much as possible, to protect them from the influences of the bad environment outside. They should be very strict in not allowing their children to sleep outside the home (“sleepovers”).


They should avoid sending their children to universities far from home where they would have to stay in university accommodation, otherwise we will lose our children, who will be assimilated into the non-Muslim society.


We have to be careful to eat only halaal (lawful)food and the parents must avoid using all kinds of haraam (unlawful) things such as cigarettes, marijuana and other things which are widely available in non-Muslim countries.




Outside the home:




We must send our children to Islamic schools from kindergarten to the end of secondary school (high school).


We must also send them to the mosque as much as possible, to pray Jumu’ah (Friday prayers) and other prayers in jamaa’ah, and to attend lectures, halaqahs (study circles) and study circles, etc.


We must establish educational and sporting activities for children and youth in places that are supervised by Muslims.


Organizing educational camps where all members of the family can go.


Fathers and mothers should strive to go to the Holy Places to perform the rituals of ‘Umrah (lesser pilgrimage)and the obligation of Hajj (pilgrimage), accompanied by their children.


Training children to speak about Islam in simple language which adults and children, Muslim and non-Muslim, can understand.


Training children to memorize Qur’aan and sending some of them – if possible – to a Muslim Arab country so that they can gain an understanding of the religion, then come back to be daa’iyahs (inviters)who are equipped with knowledge of Islam and the language of the Qur’aan.


Training some of our sons to give Jumu’ah Khutbahs (Fridat sermons), and to lead the Muslims in prayer, so that they will become leaders of the Muslim community.


Encouraging children to marry early so as to protect their religious and worldly interests.


We have to encourage them to marry Muslim girls from families who are known for their religious commitment and good attitudes.
We have to avoid using the number 911 and calling the police to come to the house to resolve conflicts. If conflicts arise, we must get in touch with a responsible member of the Muslim community or with wise Muslims to help resolve the conflict.
Not attending parties where there is dancing, music and singing, or joining in celebrations of immorality or the festivals of kufr; stopping our children, with wisdom, from going to church on Sundays with Christian students.

You simply say and believe that there is No God except Allah and that Mohammad is his Messenger. Once you say this sentence, you automatically become Muslim. From there, you start carrying on with the duties of Islam. You must do what Allah and His messenger tell you to, and stay away from what they tell you to. Islam does not tell you to do anything unless it is good for you. It also does not tell you to stay away from anything unless it is bad for you.

4259,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4259,What is the ruling on playing karate,What is the ruling on playing karate?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Karate is one of the martial 
          arts, a form of self-defence using one’s hands, without any kind of 
          weapon. It allows hitting with the foot, fist or edge of the hand, focusing 
          on concentrating all one's energy in that blow. 
 The shar’i viewpoint 
          of this sport: 
 The sport includes numerous 
          physical, psychological and mental benefits, and it is in accordance 
          with sharee’ah in some ways, and goes against it in others. Among the 
          ways in which it is in accordance with Islam are: 
The concealing garments which cover all 
          the ‘awrah completely. The rules of this sport require wearing covering 
          garments composed of a shirt of thick white cotton, and trousers made 
          of the same material, which have to be wide to allow movement of the 
          legs and feet. 
 Combatants are forbidden 
          to direct blows that will cause harm to their opponents. The rules of 
          the game dictate that attacks must be restrained, and must not cause 
          harm to one's opponent, unlike the rules of boxing, for example. 
 But on the other hand 
          this sport is not free of things that go against sharee’ah, such as 
          allowing blows to the face. 
 In addition, it includes 
          some religious rituals that are derived from local Indian religions, 
          such as the exchange of greetings between the combatants, which take 
          the form of bows that are similar to rukoo’ (the Muslim does not bow 
          to anyone except Allaah), and the exercises such as keeping silent and 
          focusing or meditating, which are derived from the religious rituals 
          of Buddhism, etc. All of these are totally rejected by Islam. 
 But it is not forbidden to practise 
          this sport once these issues have been eliminated. It is possible to 
          eliminate them on an unofficial level, even if it is not possible to 
          do so on an official and international level.  It is not essential 
          to learn these skills at the level of championships and clubs which 
          adhere to these matters and view them as an essential part of the sport 
          which everyone who practises it must adhere to.","From Qadaayaa al-Lahw wa’l-Tarfeeh, p. 369"

Riba is forbidden because of the harmful effects that result from it,

    Economic effects, e.g., keeping money idle and unproductive, and swelling the ranks of the
    poor;
    Social effects, e.g., cutting ties, creating enmity and hatred between the poor and the
    rich, and spreading corruption and promiscuity caused by need;
    Psychological and spiritual effects, e.g., arrogance, looking down on others,
    hard-heartedness and exploiting the needs of the poor.
    The above describes the effects of Riba on the individual level. On the state level,
    countries are weakened, their resources fall under the control of others, they end up

Concerning a man who takes his sons wealth
From Aaishah who said: The Messenger of Allaah 
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The best of what a man consumes is
    what he earns, and his children are part of his earnings.
From Muhammad ibn al-Munkadir: a man referred his dispute with his
    father over his earnings to the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). The
    Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: You and your wealth
    belong to your father.
From Aaishah who said: A man can consume whatever he
    wishes of his son's wealth, but a son cannot consume anything of his fathers wealth
    without his permission.
From Saeed ibn al-Musayyib, who said: A man can take
    whatever he wants from his son's wealth, but a son should not take anything from his
    fathers wealth except with his consent.
From Ibn Jurayj, who said:  Ataa did not see anything
    wrong with a man taking whatever he wanted of his son's wealth, even if it was not a case
    of necessity.
Then he said (may Allaah have mercy on him):
Those who say: a man should not take anything of his son's
    wealth except with his permission.
From Ibn Seereen, who said: A son should honour his father, but
    each man has more right to that which he himself owns.
Saalim reported that Hamzah ibn Abd-Allaah ibn Umar
    sacrificed a camel, then a beggar came to Ibn Umar [i.e., Abd-Allaah, the
    father of the one who offered the sacrifice]. Abd-Allaah said, Its not
    mine [i.e., the meat of the sacrifice isnt mine to give away]. Hamzah said:
    O my father, you have my permission, so give away whatever you want of it.
Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his book al-Mughni,
    commenting on this matter:
Any father has the right to take whatever he wants of his son's
    wealth and to take possession of it, whether the father needs it or not, and whether the
    son is an adult or a child, provided two conditions are met. The first is that this should
    not be unfair to the son or cause him any harm, and that the father should not take
    anything that the son needs. The second is that he should not take from the wealth of one
    child to give it to another child. This is what was stated by Ahmad This is because
    it is prohibited for a father to show favouritism in giving to one child from his own
    wealth, so the prohibition should apply even more to the case of a father taking from one
    child to give to another. 
Abu Haneefah, Maalik and al-Shaafa'i said:
He does not have the right to take any more from his son's wealth than
    what he needs, because the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
    Your blood and your wealth are as sacred to you as this day of yours in this month
    of yours. (Agreed upon). It was reported that the Prophet 
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: It is not permissible to take the
    wealth of a Muslim except with his consent. (Reported by al-Daaraqutni). The son has full ownership of his wealth, and it should not be taken away from
    him, as the case if he needs it . Our evidence for this is the report of
    Aaishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) who said: The Messenger of
    Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The best of what you
    consume is what you earn, and your children are part of what you earn. (Reported
    by Saeed and al-Tirmidhi, who said: a hasan hadeeth). Amr ibn
    Shuayb reported, from his father, from his grandfather, who said: A man came
    to the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said, My father
    needed all my wealth. He said, You and your wealth belong to your
    father. A longer version was reported by al-Tabaraani in al-Mujam,
    and by others, which adds: Your children are among the best of your earnings, so
    consume whatever they have of wealth. Muhammad ibn al-Munkadir and al-Mutlib ibn
    Hantab reported: A man came to the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him) and said: I have wealth and children, and my father has wealth
    and children, but my father wants to take my wealth. The Prophet 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: You and your wealth belong to your
    father. (Reported by Saeed in his Sunan).
    Also, Allaah has described the child as a gift to his father, as He says (interpretation
    of the meanings):
    And We bestowed upon him Ishaaq, and (a grandson)
    Yaqoob [al-Anbiya 21:72]
 and We bestowed upon him Yahyaa
    [al-Anbiya 21:90]
[Zakariya said:] So give me from Yourself an
    heir. [Maryam 19:5]
[Ibraaheem said]: All praises and thanks be to Allaah, Who
    has given me in old age Ismaaeel and Ishaaq [Ibraaheem 14:39]
Whoever is given to a person as a gift, he is allowed to take his
    wealth, just as he has the right to take the wealth of his slave. (al-Mughni, part
    5).
In the dissertations and fatwas of the Mufti Shaykh Muhammad ibn
    Ibraaheem ibn Abd al-Lateef Aal al-Shaykh, it says the following:
A father is permitted to take from his sons wealth, because of
    the sayings of the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): You and
    your wealth belong to your father (reported by the five and classed as saheeh
    by al-Tirmidhi) and The best of what you consume is what you earn,
    and your children are part of your earnings (reported by al-Tirmidhi,
    al-Nisaa'i and Ibn Maajah from Aaishah). The fathers
    taking from his son's earnings is subject to six conditions:
    He should not take what his child needs or the loss of which would cause
        harm to his child.

He should not give it to another of his children.

He should not take anything when either of them is on his deathbed.

The father should not be a kaafir when the son is a Muslim.

The wealth should exist in a tangible form.

Whatever the father takes from his son becomes his when he takes it with the appropriate
        intention or a spoken statement. 
This is the gist of what our fuqaha (may Allaah have mercy on
    them) have said, and this is our fatwa.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
