26913,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26913,How should he deal with his wife who is mentally ill?,"I am married for 5 years and have 1 1/2 year old daughter. My wife is stubborn and non comprising. Her stubbornness is deep rooted psychological problem because if I do not do things as per her wish then she starts crying sometime late night and then slowly she goes into depression. 

From the beginning my wife disliked my family. She would never let me have a good family time. She mistreated my mother several times. Because my wife goes into depression I have not taken any strong action. But now I can not tolerate this behaviour. I want to take care of mother and give her happiness too. 

Her parents have failed to make her behave in good manners.They advised her to go to a psychiatrist, but she does not want to go. I know she is mentally ill to a certain extent. Please advice.",,,"Praise be to Allah.We appreciate your confidence in us, and we 
    ask Allaah to guide us all to the right path. 
I have read your letter more than once and I 
    feel that it is difficult for me to understand the issues properly, because it seems to be somewhat complicated, so I cannot blame one of you. But 
    I feel that both of you have some share of blame for the problem.  
But I can offer the following advice and 
    suggest that you do these things, and I ask Allaah to make this a help for you in solving your problem. 
Firstly: 
Each of you must come back to Allaah because 
    sin has an effect on people’s family lives and on all their relationships. Hence one of the salaf said: when I commit sin, I see its effect on my 
    family and my riding-beast. This confirms what the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, according to the hadeeth 
    narrated by Abu Hurayrah who said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When Allaah loves a person He 
    calls Jibreel and says, ‘I love So and so, so love him.’ Then Jibreel loves him, then he calls out in the heavens saying, ‘Allaah loves him, so 
    love him.’ Then the inhabitants of heaven love him, and he also finds acceptance on earth. But if Allaah hates a person, He calls Jibreel and 
    says, ‘I hate So and so, so hate him.’ Then Jibreel hates him, then he calls out in the heavens saying, ‘Allaah hates So and so, so hate him.’ So 
    they hate him, and he is also hated on earth.” 
Secondly: 
Each person must turn towards his Lord and 
    call upon him. Allaah Says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Is not He (better than your gods) Who 
    responds to the distressed one, when he calls on Him, and Who removes the evil”
[al-Naml 27:62]
So he must persist in du’aa’, and seek out the times when du’aa’ 
    is more likely to be accepted, such as the last third of the night, when our Lord descends and calls out, “Who will call upon Me, that I may 
    answer him; who will seek My forgiveness, that I may forgive him; who will ask of Me, that I may give to him; who will repent to Me, that I may 
    accept his repentance?” So you should call upon your Lord and have certain faith that He will respond, but do not try to hasten the response, for 
    Allaah will respond to His slave so long as he does not try to hasten the response and does not say “I made du’aa’ but I received no answer.” 
The Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah has not sent down any malady but He has also sent down the remedy; those who know it, know it, and those who do 
    not know it, do not know it.” (Narrated by Ahmad, 3397; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 1650). So you must 
    recite the du’aa’s that are prescribed in sharee’ah, such as ruqyah, reciting Qur’aan, etc. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And We send down of the Qur’aan that which 
    is a healing and a mercy to those who believe”
[al-Isra’ 17:82]
If she refuses to be checked out by a 
    psychiatrist, then there is nothing wrong with your trying to mediate between them. 
Fourthly:
What your wife needs most from you is that 
    you should be warm and loving towards her. For example, take her for a drive in the car to a place that is calming and soothing to the nerves, or 
    take her on a trip to another city. Insist kindly on taking her out if she refuses and choose activities that she is accustomed to and that she 
    likes, such as going to a place that she likes or letting her do some of her hobbies. 
Fifthly:
Do not be forceful if she refuses to 
    cooperate, because for the one who is depressed  you can draw attention to things but you cannot demand him to do things, because that will 
    increase his feelings of failure. 
Sixthly:
I advise you to be kind and gentle, for there 
    is no kindness in a thing but it adorns it . 
Finally, you should note that the person who 
    is suffering from depression is lethargic and is not interested in improving his situation, such as trying to recover from depression by himself. 
    Remember that most cases of depression can be dealt with but it may need a long time and goodly patience. Remember that you may be one of the 
    causes of her illness, so do not rush to end the relationship.  You have to help her to get out of the situation she is in, and remember that no 
    matter how difficult it is to be patient, the results will be good,
And Allaah knows best. May Allaah send 
    blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon his family and companions.",Islam Q&A
26952,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26952,Is it permissible to slaughter an animal with the intention of offering a sacrifice?,"I have been married for four years and have not been blessed with children. Praise be to Allaah, I have recently heard the news that my wife is pregnant, and on my father’s advice I slaughtered two animals (as a sacrifice) and distributed the meat among needy Muslims, purely for the sake of Allaah on behalf of myself and my wife. What is the Islamic ruling on that? May Allaah reward you with good.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    If this sacrifice and feeding the needy was done as an act of 
    thanksgiving to Allaah, then it is permissible, for feeding people is a way 
    of doing good to people, and Allaah loves those who do good. 

    But if your sacrifice was aimed at warding off evil and 
    bringing about  good, then it is not permissible. This is what is well-known 
    among people when the word “sacrifice” (fadw) is used, because they 
    think that by doing this they will ward off evil and bring about good, so 
    they do this when accidents or sickness happen to them or their loved ones. 

    In Islam, sacrifice is not a means of warding off that which 
    has been decreed by Allaah, whether good or bad. 

    Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    was asked about slaughtering an animal when a building is completed or 
    halfway through building. He said: 

    This action is subject to further examination. If the 
    intention behind the sacrifice is to protect oneself against the jinn or 
    some other intention by which the owner of the house intends to achieve 
    something, such as keeping it or its occupants safe, this is not 
    permissible, and it is a kind of bid’ah (innovation). If it is done for the 
    jinn then it is major shirk, because it is an act of worship done for 
    someone other than Allaah. 
But if it is done as an 
    act of thanksgiving for a blessing that Allaah has bestowed, such as 
    reaching the roof or completing the house, so the person gathers his 
    relatives and neighbours and invites them to this feast, there is nothing 
    wrong with this. This is what many people do as an act of thanksgiving for a 
    blessing from Allaah, as He has enabled them to build a house and live in it 
    instead of renting. Similar to this is what some people do when they come 
    back from a journey, and they invite their relatives and neighbours as an 
    act of thanksgiving to Allaah for their safe arrival.  When the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came back from a journey he 
    would sacrifice a camel and invite the people to eat. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 
    3089). 

    Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 
    5/388. 

    Shaykh Muhammad al-Saalih ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have 
    mercy on him) said: 
What some people do when 
    they move into a new house and slaughter an animal and invite their 
    neighbours and relatives is fine so long as it is not accompanied by any 
    corrupt beliefs, as is done in some places where, when a person moves into a 
    new house, the first thing he does is to bring a sheep and slaughter it on 
    the threshold so that the blood will fall onto it, and they say that this 
    will prevent the jinn from entering the house. This is a corrupt belief 
    which has no basis in Islam. But if a person slaughters it as an expression 
    of joy and happiness, there is nothing wrong with that.

I was looking for it and I did not tell her that I had taken it and lost it. Please note that I was only twelve years old. Now I regret it deeply and I want to expiate for my sin. What should I do? Please advise me, may Allaah reward you with good.",,,"Praise be to Allah.You did a mistake when you took the ring without permission and when you did not tell your mother after you lost it. What you have to do now is to tell your mother and ask her for forgiveness, and to compensate her with a ring like the one that she had. Because whoever takes the property of someone else without permission is a robber or one who seizes property unlawfully, and he must replace what he has taken. If this was done at a young age, below the age of adolescence, then the burden of sin is lifted, but the obligation to replace the item still remains, because the scholars have stated that a child must replace things that he has destroyed and make up for the loss in value that may have affected the things he took, then return them (to their owner).
 But if you think that telling her about this will most likely lead to a breakdown in relations or problem between you, then simply give her a ring, even if it appears to be a gift.

26964,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26964,Prohibition against spying on others,"I work for a company and my boss has asked me to tell him what the employees are saying about him personally, despite the fact that some of what they are saying is true. Is the money that I receive in return for this spying halaal or haraam?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    It is not permissible for you to do this haraam action, 
    because it involves nameemah (malicious gossip) and spying, and the reward 
    you receive for this is haraam earnings. 

    You should note that nameemah is a major sin. Nameemah means 
    telling some people what others have said about them in order to cause 
    trouble among them. This is the most common definition of nameemah. Ibn 
    Hajar al-Haythami narrated it in his book al-Zawaajir ‘an Iqtiraaf 
    al-Kabaa’ir, then he said: “It says in al-Ihya’: it is not 
    limited to that, rather it refers to disclosure of anything that may hurt or 
    offend somebody if it is disclosed, whether it is the person who is spoken 
    about who is offended, or the person who hears the gossip, or a third party, 
    whether it is disclosed verbally, in writing or by means of a hint or a 
    gesture, and whether what is transmitted is an action, a word, a fault or a 
    shortcoming in the person who is being talked about, or in someone else. The 
    definition of nameemah is uncovering secrets and disclosing that which it is 
    not appropriate to disclose. Hence we should keep silent and refrain from 
    telling everything that we see of people’s situations, unless speaking of it 
    will bring some benefit to a Muslim or ward off some harm. For example, if 
    you see a person taking someone else’s property, you have to bear witness to 
    that, in contrast to if you see someone hiding his own money, in which case 
    speaking of it would be nameemah and disclosing a person’s secrets. If what 
    is spoken of is a fault or shortcoming in the person of whom one speaks, 
    then this is gheebah (backbiting) and nameemah (malicious gossip).” 

    (al-Zawaajir, no. 252: al-Nameemah) 
It was narrated that 
    al-Haafiz al-Mundhiri said: “The ummah is unanimously agreed that nameemah 
    is forbidden and that it is one of the greatest sins in the sight of 
    Allaah.” 

    From this we know that your passing on to your boss what your 
    colleagues say is a kind of disclosing secrets and creating mischief and 
    falling into this major sin, in addition to it being spying, which is 
    haraam. 

    There are many texts which condemn nameemah and spying and 
    seeking out people’s faults, which will deter the Muslim from committing 
    these haraam actions: 

    1 – The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said: “No person who spreads nameemah will enter Paradise.” According 
    to another report, “No eavesdropper (qattaat)…” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 
    6056; Muslim, 105. 
A qattaat is someone who 
    spreads nameemah. It was said that the one who spreads nameemah is the 
    person who is with a group who are speaking, then he spreads gossip about 
    them, and that the qattaat is the one who listens to them without them 
    realizing, then he spreads gossip about them. 

    2 – In al-Saheehayn it is narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas 
    said: “The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) out of 
    one of the gardens of Madeenah, and he heard the sounds of two people who 
    were being tormented in their graves. He said, ‘They are being punished, not 
    for something that was difficult to avoid, but it is nevertheless a major 
    sin. One of them did not protect himself from urine (i.e., take measures to 
    avoid contaminating himself or his clothes) and the other used to walk about 
    spreading nameemah.’”

    (al-Bukhaari, 216; Muslim, 292). 

    3 – It is also narrated in al-Saheehayn from Abu 
    Hurayrah that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said: ‘Beware of suspicion, for suspicion is the falsest of speech. Do not 
    eavesdrop; do not spy on one another; do not envy one another; do not 
    forsake one another; do not hate one another. Be, O slaves of Allaah, 
    brothers.”

    Al-Bukhaari, 5144; Muslim, 2563. 

    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “Some of the 
    scholars said that tahassus [‘eavesdropping’] means listening to other 
    people’s conversations, and tajassus [‘spying’] means seeking out their 
    faults. Or it was suggested that tajassus means looking for secrets. The 
    word is mostly used in the sense of evil. The jaasoos (spy) is the one who 
    seeks out secrets for evil purposes and the naamoos is the one who seeks out 
    secrets for good purposes. And it was said that tajassus means looking for 
    information for someone else, and tahassus means looking for information for 
    oneself. This was the view of Tha’lab. And it was said that they mean one 
    and the same, which is seeking out information about people’s 
    circumstances.”  

    4 – al-Bukhaari (7042) narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas that the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever 
    speaks of a dream that he did not actually see will be ordered [on the Day 
    of Judgement] to tie two grains of barley together, and he will never be 
    able to do so. Whoever listens in on other people’s conversations when they 
    do not like that will have molten lead poured into his ears on the Day of 
    Resurrection. Whoever makes an image will be punished and will be ordered to 
    breath life into it, and he will not be able to do so.” 

    5 – Ahmad (19277) and Abu Dawood (4880) narrated that Abu 
    Barzah al-Aslami said: “The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: ‘O you who have spoken the words of faith but 
    faith has not truly entered your hearts! Do not backbite about the Muslims, 
    and do not seek out their faults. For whoever seeks out their faults, Allaah 
    will seek out his faults, and if Allaah seeks out a person’s faults He will 
    expose him even in his own house.’” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in 
    Saheeh Abi Dawood, 4083. 
We do not think that a 
    believer would read these great ahaadeeth and then volunteer to spy on his 
    fellow-Muslims, or seek out their faults, or spread nameemah among them. We 
    think that you are one of those who will benefit from this and pay 
    attention, in sha Allaah. Hence we say that you must refuse to do this task, 
    no matter what encouragement or threats you may receive, whilst also 
    advising your colleagues to stop gossiping about their boss and telling them 
    off for doing so. 

    You should also advise your boss to stop spying on his 
    employees and not be suspicious about them, because that will corrupt them 
    and make them lose trust, as the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) said: “If you seek out people’s faults you will corrupt them or 
    almost corrupt them.” 

    Narrated by Abu Dawood, 4888; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani 
    in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 4088. 
We will conclude with a 
    few points about the attitude of the Muslim towards nameemah or malicious 
    gossip when it is passed on to him. 

    Ibn Hajar al-Haythami said in his book al-Zawaajir ‘an 
    Iqtiraaf al-Kabaa’ir: 

    “The person who hears some malicious gossip, such as being 
    told ‘So and so said this about you’ or ‘he did this to you,’ must do six 
    things: 

    1 – He should not believe it, because the one who spreads 
    nameemah is a faasiq (evildoer) according to scholarly consensus, and Allaah 
    says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “If a Faasiq (liar — evil person) comes to you with any 
    news, verify it, lest you should harm people in ignorance, and afterwards 
    you become regretful for what you have done”

    [al-Hujuraat 49:6]

    2 – He should tell him not to repeat this evil action, which 
    is evil in both religious and worldly terms. 

    3 – He should hate him for the sake of Allaah if he shows no 
    sign of repenting. 

    4 – He should not think badly of the one of whom it was said, 
    because he does not know whether that person really said it or did it. 

    5 – What he has been told should not make him spy on others 
    or look for their faults for the purpose of verifying what was said, because 
    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Avoid much suspicion; indeed some suspicions are sins. 
    And spy not…”

    [al-Hujuraat 49:12]
6 – He should not approve 
    for himself that which he has told the other person not to do, so he should 
    not pass on the malicious gossip and say, ‘So and so told me this,’ 
    otherwise he will also be gossiping and backbiting, and he will be doing 
    that which he told someone else not to do. 

    ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez (may Allaah be pleased with him) 
    said to someone who passed on some malicious gossip to him: “If you wish, we 
    can look into the matter. If you are lying, you will be one of the people 
    mentioned in the verse ‘If a Faasiq (liar — evil person) comes to you 
    with any news’ [al-Hujuraat 49:6 – interpretation of the meaning]; and 
    if you are telling the truth, you will be one of the people mentioned in the 
    verse, ‘A slanderer, going about with calumnies’ [al-Qalam 68:11 – 
    interpretation of the meaning]. Or if you wish, we will forgive you.” He 
    said, “Forgive me, O Ameer al-Mu’mineen, I will never do it again.” 

    The caliph Sulaymaan ibn ‘Abd al-Malik rebuked someone who 
    had spread nameemah about him, in the presence of al-Zuhri. The man denied 
    that and Sulaymaan said to him, “The one who told me about it is one who 
    does not tell lies.” Al-Zuhri said: “The one who spreads nameemah (malicious 
    gossip) cannot be truthful.” Sulaymaan said, “You are right,” and he let the 
    man go in peace. 

    Al-Hasan said: “The one who tells malicious gossip to you 
    will tell malicious gossip about you. This indicates that the person who 
    spreads malicious gossip should be hated and not believed or trusted. How 
    can he not be hated when he persists in lying, backbiting, slandering, 
    betraying, deceiving, envying, spreading mischief among the people and 
    cheating? He is one of those who try to sever the ties which Allaah has 
    commanded must be upheld and who spread mischief on earth. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
‘The way (of blame) is 
    only against those who oppress men and rebel in the earth without 
    justification; for such there will be a painful torment’

    [al-Shoora 42:42]

    - and the one who spreads malicious gossip is one of them.”

This hadeeth does not indicate that al-Dahr is one of the names of Allaah, rather what the hadeeth means is that Allaah is the One who controls time. 
Al-Khattaabi said: 
What this means is: I am the Owner of Time, the Controller of all affairs that they attribute to time, so whoever inveighs against time because it does these things, is in effect inveighing against his Lord Who is the One who does them.

Al-Dahr is not one of the names of Allaah, and whoever claims that is erring for two reasons: 
1 – His Names are the most perfect and beautiful, they should refer to the most eloquent and beautiful meanings. Hence we do not find any name among the names of Allaah that does not refer to any attribute. Al-Dahr is such a word, and it cannot mean anything other than time.
2 – The context of the hadeeth renders that impossible, because He says, “I alternate the night and the day”; night and day are time, so how can the thing that is controlled be the one that controls them??

If it is obligatory, should they pray at home or in the Musalla (prayer place)?","`Eid prayer is not obligatory for women, but it is Sunnah. Women should offer `Eid prayer in the prayer-place with the Muslims, because the Prophet enjoined women to do that.",,"Praise be to Allah.`Eid prayer is not obligatory for women, but it is Sunnah. Women should offer this prayer in the prayer-place with the Muslims, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoined them to do that. 
It is narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim and others that Umm `Atiyah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “We were commanded (and in one report it says, he commanded us – meaning the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)) to bring out to the `Eid prayers the adolescent girls and the women in seclusion, and he commanded the menstruating women to avoid the prayer-place of the Muslims.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1/93; Muslim, 890) According to another report: “We were commanded to come out and to bring out the adolescent girls and those in seclusion.”  
According to a report narrated by At-Tirmidhi, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to bring out the virgins, adolescent girls, women in seclusion and menstruating women on the two `Eids, but the menstruating women were to keep away from the prayer place and witness the gathering of the Muslims. One of them said, “O Messenger of Allah, what if she does not have a jilbab?” He said, “Then let her sister lend her one of her jilbabs.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim )
According to a report narrated by Al-Nasa’i, Hafsah bint Sirin (may Allah have mercy on her) said: Umm `Atiyyah hardly ever mentioned the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) but she would say, “May my father be sacrificed for him.” I said, “Did you hear the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say such and such,” and she said, “Yes, may my father be sacrificed for him, and he said, `Let the adolescent girls, women in seclusion and menstruating women come out to attend `Eid and witness the gathering of the Muslims, but let the menstruating women avoid the prayer place.’” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1/84) 
Based on the above, it is clear that for women to go out and attend the `Eid prayers is a confirmed Sunnah, but that is subject to the condition that they do not go out unveiled or making a wanton display of themselves, as is known from other evidence. 
With regard to boys who have reached the age of discretion going out to the `Eid prayer , Jumu`ah prayers, etc., this is something which is well known and is prescribed in Islam, because there is a great deal of evidence to that effect.

I hope that you can help me and pray for me to be guided. May Allaah reward you.",,,"Praise be to Allah.and blessings and peace be upon the Messenger of Allaah.
    
    We ask Allaah to guide you, and to ward off evil and 
    immorality from you, and to make you one of His sincerely-devoted slaves. 
    For Allaah may delay but He never forgets. How can you be sure that when 
    Allaah sees you committing this sin, He is not going to say, “By My Glory 
    and Majesty, I will not forgive you”? 

    Look at these physical faculties with which you are 
    committing sin. Do you not see that Allaah is able to deprive you of their 
    blessings and to cause you the pain of losing them? 

    Then look at how Allaah has concealed you (your sin) and has 
    been patient and forbearing with you. You know about His protective jealousy 
    over His slaves, so how can you be sure that He will not become angry with 
    you and expose your affairs, so that people will come to know your secrets 
    and you will suffer scandal in this world before the Hereafter? 

    Will you get anything from haraam (unlawful) looks apart from grief, 
    misery and darkness in the heart? 

    Even if you feel some pleasure for a day or two, or for a 
    month or a year… what will come after that? 

    Death… then the grave… then the Reckoning… then torment, when 
    all pleasure will vanish and only sorrow will remain. 

    If you feel ashamed to let your brother see you committing 
    this sin, then how can you think of Allaah as the least important of those 
    who watch you? 

    Do you not know that Allaah can see you, and that His angels 
    are recording your deeds, and that tomorrow (i.e., on the Day of 
    Resurrection) your own limbs will speak of what used to happen? 

    Think about what will become of you after you sin: worry and 
    distress in the heart, alienation between you and Allaah, loss of humility… 
    you give up praying at night (qiyaam al-layl)… you forsake fasting… Tell me, 
    by your Lord, what is this life worth? 

    Every time you look at these devilish screens, a black spot 
    appears on your heart, until it is covered with layers of blackness, then by 
    the raan (stain) which overwhelms the heart, and deprives you of the 
    pleasure of obeying Allaah and of the sweetness of faith. 

    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said: “When a slave commits a sin, a black spot appears on his heart. But if 
    he give it up, seeks forgiveness and repents, his heart will be cleansed, 
    but if he repeats it, (the blackness) will increase until it overwhelms his 
    heart. This is the raan which Allaah mentions: 
    ‘Nay! But on their hearts is the Raan (covering of sins and 
    evil deeds) which they used to earn’ [al-Mutaffifeen 83:14 – interpretation 
    of the meaning].”

    (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3257; Ibn Maajah, 4234; classed as hasan (sound) by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah, 3422).

    So be among those who give up sin, seek forgiveness and 
    repent. Beseech Allaah frequently to purify your heart and protect your 
    chastity, and to grant you refuge from the traps of the Shaytaan. 

    Avoid everything that may call you to haraam things or remind 
    you of them, if you are sincere and really want to repent. 

    Hasten to get this (satellite) dish out of your house, and cut your connection to these bad sites on the internet. Note that the best means of 
    helping yourself give up the haraam things that you have gotten used to is 
    to nip it in the bud, and ward off every thought of looking that crosses 
    your mind, before it becomes a desire, wish or intention, and then an 
    action. 

    Al-Ghazzaali (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “If the 
    first inward thought is not warded off, it will generate a desire, then the 
    desire will generate a wish, and the wish will generate an intention, and 
    the intention will generate the action, and the action will result in ruin 
    and divine wrath. So evil must be cut off at its root, which is when it is 
    simply a thought that crosses the mind, from which all the other things 
    follow on.” (Ihyaa’ ‘Uloom al-Deen, 6/17). 

    This is based on the words of Allaah (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “O you who believe! Follow not the footsteps of Shaytaan 
    (Satan). And whosoever follows the footsteps of Shaytaan (Satan), then, 
    verily, he commands Al-Fahsha’ [i.e. to commit indecency (illegal sexual 
    intercourse)], and Al-Munkar [disbelief and polytheism (i.e. to do evil and 
    wicked deeds; and to speak or to do what is forbidden in Islam)]”

    [al-Noor 24:21]

     If you can do without the Internet altogether, then go ahead 
    and do that, until you feel that your heart and your faith are stronger.

     Strive to find righteous friends, strive to perform all the prayers on time, and do a lot of naafil (voluntary) acts of worship. Avoid being alone and thinking about haraam things as much as possible.

     Sincerity in seeking treatment opens the door to good, and 
    closes the door to evil.

     We ask Allaah to enable us and you to repent sincerely.

26991,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26991,Du’aa’ in Eid prayer,What is the du’aa’ in Eid prayer?,,,"Praise be to Allah.We do not know of any du’aa’ that has been prescribed specifically for the Eid prayer or for the day of Eid; rather it is prescribed for the Muslims to recite Takbeer (“Allaahu akbar”), Tasbeeh (“Subhaan Allaah”), Tahleel (“Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah”) and Tahmeed (“al-hamdu Lillaah”) on the night before Eid and on the morning of Eid, until the end of the khutbah on the day of Eid al-Fitr and until the end of the days of Tashreeq on the occasion of Eid al-Adha, as is also prescribed during the first ten days of Dhu’l-Hijjah, because Allaah says concerning Eid al-Fitr (interpretation of the meaning): 
“(He wants that you) must complete the same number (of days), and that you must magnify Allaah [i.e. to say Takbeer (Allaahu Akbar: Allaah is the Most Great)] for having guided you”
