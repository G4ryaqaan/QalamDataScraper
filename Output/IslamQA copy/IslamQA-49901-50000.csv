    Young men have to fear Allaah their Lord, and keep away from 
    listening to or looking at the things that will provoke their desire. They 
    should make the most of Ramadaan to discipline themselves, for this is the 
    month of the Qur’an and the month of piety. It is not befitting for a Muslim 
    to fail to make the most of this month to forsake forbidden desires and seek 
    reward, fearing his Lord. Allaah says of the fasting person in a hadeeth 
    qudsi: “He forsakes his food, his drink and his desires for My sake.” 
    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1894; Muslim, 1151. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: 

    One should be patient in avoiding masturbation, because it is 
    haraam as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And those who guard their chastity (i.e. private parts, 
    from illegal sexual acts)

    6. Except from their wives or (the slaves) that their 
    right hands possess,  
    for then, they are free from blame;

    7. But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the 
    transgressors”  

    [al-Mu’minoon 23:5-7]

    And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said: “O young men, whoever among you can afford to get married, let 
    him do so, for it is more effective in lowering the gaze and guarding one’s 
    chastity. And whoever cannot afford that should fast.” 

    If masturbation were permissible, the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) would have told them to do it, because it 
    is easier and because people find pleasure in it, unlike fasting which is 
    difficult. Because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) enjoined fasting instead, this indicates that masturbation is not 
    permissible. 

    Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 
    19.189. 
You should try hard to 
    get married so that you can give up this bad habit. Seek the help of your 
    Lord by praying to Him and obeying Him, so that you can rid yourself of this 
    sinful habit. 

    We ask Allaah to purify your heart and protect you from sin, 
    and to help you to do that which He loves and which pleases Him.

49944,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/49944,The Amount of Fidyah for Not Fasting,What is the amount of Fidyah that is mentioned in the verse on fasting?.,"If Ramadan comes and a person is unable to fast because he is elderly or sick with no hope of recovery, then he is not obliged to fast, but he should feed one poor person for each day.

The Amount of Fidyah for not fasting","Praise be to Allah.Who must pay the Fidyah?
If Ramadan comes and a person is unable to fast because he is elderly or sick with no hope of recovery, then he is not obliged to fast because he is unable to do so. So he should not fast and he should feed one poor person for each day . 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Observing fasts is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, that you may become pious.
[Observing fasts] for a fixed number of days, but if any of you is ill or on a journey, the same number (should be made up) from other days. And as for those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g. an old man), they have (a choice either to fast or) to feed a poor person (for every day). But whoever does good of his own accord, it is better for him. And that you fast is better for you if only you know.” [Al-Baqarah 2:183-184]
Al-Bukhari (4505) narrated that Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “This has not been abrogated. It refers to old men and old women who are not able to fast, so they should feed a poor person for each day.” 
Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Mughni (4/396): 
“If fasting is too difficult for an old man or an old woman, and will cause them intense hardship, then they are allowed not to fast, and they should feed one poor person for each day. If they are also unable to feed a poor person, then they do not have to do anything, for “Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope” [Al-Baqarah 2:286]. If a sick person has no hope of recovery, he is allowed not to fast, and he should feed one poor person for each day, because he comes under the same ruling as an old man.” 
In Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (5/117) it says: 
“The Hanafis, Shafi`is and Hanbalis agreed that the Fidyah for not fasting should be paid when there is no hope of making up the missed fasts because of old age which makes a person unable to fast, or sickness from which there is no hope of recovery, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And as for those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g. an old man), they have (a choice either to fast or) to feed a poor person (for every day).” [Al-Baqarah 2:184] What is meant is those for whom it is too difficult to fast.” 
Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Fatawa As-Siyam (p.111): 
“It is essential to note that the sick may be divided into two categories: 

Those for whom there is the hope of recovery, such as those with temporary sickness from which there is the hope of recovery. In this case the ruling is as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “but if any of you is ill or on a journey, the same number (should be made up) from other days” [Al-Baqarah 2:184]. All they have to do is wait until they are better, then fast. If it so happens that the sickness continues and the person dies before recovering, then there is no sin on him, because Allah has only enjoined him to make it up from other days, but he died before those other days came. This is like a person who dies in Sha’ban before Ramadan begins – so it should not be made up on his behalf. 
Cases where sickness is ongoing, such as cancer – Allah forbid – kidney disease, diabetes and similar chronic diseases where there is no hope of recovery. These people are allowed not to fast in Ramadan, but they have to feed one poor person for each day, like old men and women who are unable to fast, so they may not fast and should feed one poor person for each day. The evidence for that in the Quran is the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And as for those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g. an old man), they have (a choice either to fast or) to feed a poor person (for every day).” [Al-Baqarah 2:184]

The Amount of Fidyah for not fasting
With regard to the manner of feeding, one has the choice between giving each poor person half a Sa` of food such as rice and the like (i.e., approximately one and a half kilograms) or making food and inviting the poor to eat. 
Al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “As for an old man who is unable to fast, after Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) grew old, for one or two years he fed a poor person with bread and meat and he did not fast.” 
Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about an elderly woman who was unable to fast – what should she do? 
He (may Allah have mercy on him) replied: 
“She should feed one poor person for each day, giving half a Sa` of the local staple food, such as dates, rice, etc, which is equivalent to approximately one and a half kilograms. This was stated by a number of the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), such as Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him). If she is poor and is unable to feed a poor person, then she does not have to do anything. This expiation may be given to one or more people at the beginning of the month or in the middle or at the end. And Allah is the Source of strength.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn Baz (15/203) 
Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Fatawa As-Siyam (p. 111): 
“The sick person who has an ongoing sickness, and elderly people, both male and female, who are unable to fast, must feed one poor person for each day, whether that is by giving this food to the poor or by inviting the same number of poor people as days in the month to a meal, as Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) used to do when he grew old. He would gather together thirty poor people and that was instead of fasting for a month.”  
The Standing Committee (11/164) was asked about the giving of food by one who is unable to fast in Ramadan such as old men, old women and the incurably sick. 
They replied: 
“If a person is unable to fast in Ramadan because of old age, such as elderly men and women, or it is very difficult for them to fast, then they are allowed not to fast, but they have to feed one poor person for each day, giving half a Sa’ of wheat, dates or rice etc, the same as he gives to his own family. The same applies to a sick person who is unable to fast or for whom it is very difficult to fast, and there is no hope of recovery for him, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope.” [Al-Baqarah 2:286]
“and [Allah] has not laid upon you in religion any hardship.” [Al-Hajj 22:78] 
““And as for those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g. an old man), they have (a choice either to fast or) to feed a poor person (for every day).”” [Al-Baqarah 2:184]”

    11774 and
    21536 the ruling on 
    women covering their faces and hands, and that it is obligatory for them to 
    cover them in front of non-mahram men. 

    Allaah has enjoined woman to be obedient to her husband, and 
    has made men qawwaamoon (protectors and maintainers) of women. They are 
    supposed to direct and look after women as a leader directs and looks after 
    his people, because of the physical and mental characteristics with which 
    Allaah has distinguished them, as well as the financial duties that He has 
    enjoined upon them. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Men are the protectors 
    and maintainers of women, because Allaah has made one of them to excel the 
    other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:34]

    Ibn Katheer said:  

    ‘Ali ibn Abi Talhah said, narrating from Ibn ‘Abbaas: “Men 
    are the protectors and maintainers of women” means: they are in charge 
    of them and the woman should obey her husband in the matters in which Allaah 
    has enjoined obedience. Obeying him means treating his family well and 
    looking after his wealth. 

    Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 1/492. 
If the wife goes against 
    his wishes and refuses to obey him, the husband has to take a gradual 
    approach in handling the matter. First he should admonish her and remind her 
    of the punishment for disobeying his command. If that does not succeed, then 
    he moves on to forsaking her in bed. If that does not work, then he may hit 
    her, but in a manner that is not severe, and there is nothing wrong with 
    also threatening her with divorce. 

    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “As to those women on whose part you see ill-conduct, 
    admonish them (first), (next) refuse to share their beds, (and last) beat 
    them (lightly, if it is useful)”

    [al-Nisa 4:34]

    Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Sa’di said: 

    “those women on whose part you see ill-conduct” means, 
    those who refuse to obey their husbands and disobey them in word or deed; 
    they should be disciplined gradually. “Admonish them (first)” means, 
    explain the ruling of Allaah concerning obedience to one’s husband, 
    encouraging obedience and warning against disobedience. If the wife stops, 
    then that is what is wanted. Otherwise the husband should forsake her in her 
    bed, by not sleeping with her or having intercourse with her, until the 
    desired result is achieved. Otherwise he may hit her, in a manner that is 
    not severe. If one of these methods achieves the desired result and the wife 
    obeys, then “seek not against them means (of annoyance)” i.e., you 
    have got what you wanted, so do not keep rebuking them for things that are 
    in the past, or draw attention to faults that will cause trouble if you 
    mention them.  

    Tafseer al-Sa’di, p. 142. 

    You can seek help in admonishing her and advising her by 
    means of useful tapes and books which speak of the obligation of hijab for 
    the Muslim woman, and explain the seriousness of disobedience and its 
    consequences in this world and in the Hereafter. 

    You have to be gentle and kind with her. The Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allah is kind 
    and He loves kindness and confers uponkindness that 
    which he does not confer upon harshness anddoes not 
    confer upon anything else besides it (kindness).”  Narrated by Muslim, 
    2593.   

    And he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “There is never any kindness in a thing but it adorns it, and kindness is 
    never lacking from a thing but that makes it ugly.” Narrated by Muslim,

What to do if you break a makeup fast","Praise be to Allah.Breaking a makeup fast without a valid excuse
If a person starts an obligatory fast, such as making up a missed Ramadan fast or offering expiation for breaking a vow (kaffarat yamin), it is not permissible for him to break the fast without a valid excuse , such as sickness or travel. 
What to do if you break a makeup fast
If he breaks his fast – with or without an excuse – he has to make up that day, but he does not have to offer any expiation, because expiation is only required for intercourse during the day in Ramadan . 
If he breaks the fast with no excuse, then he has to repent to Allah for this haram action.
Ibn Qudamah (4/412) said: 
“If a person starts an obligatory fast, such as making up a missed Ramadan fast , or a fast that he vowed to observe , or an expiatory fast, it is not permissible for him to break the fast. There is no scholarly difference of opinion on this point, praise be to Allah.” 
Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmu’ (6/383): 
“If a person has intercourse during a fast other than in Ramadan, such as making up a missed fast , or a fast that he vowed to observe, etc., no expiation (kaffarah) is required. This is the view of the majority. Qatadah said: He has to offer expiation if he broke a fast that he was observing to make up for a missed Ramadan fast.” (Al-Mughni, 4/378) 
Shaykh Ibn Baz was asked in Majmu’ al-Fatawa (15/355): 
I was fasting one day to make up for a missed fast, but after Zuhr prayer I felt hungry so I ate and drank deliberately, not because I had forgotten or was unaware. What is the ruling on this action of mine? 
He replied: 
“You have to complete the fast. It is not permissible to break the fast if that was an obligatory fast such as making up a missed Ramadan fast or a fast that you vowed to observe. You also have to repent from what you did. Whoever repents to Allah, Allah will accept his repentance.”
 Shaykh Ibn Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked (20/451): 
In the past I fasted to make up for what I owed, then I broke the fast deliberately. After that I made up that fast one day. I do not know whether that is sufficient or do I have to fast for two consecutive months? Do I have to offer expiation? Please advise me. 
He replied: 
“If a person starts an obligatory fast, such as making up a missed Ramadan fast or offering expiation for breaking a vow (kaffarat yameen), or expiation for shaving during Hajj if he shaved his head before exiting ihram, or any other obligatory fast, it is not permissible for him to break the fast without a valid shar’i excuse. The same applies to anyone who starts an obligatory action – he has to complete it and it is not permissible for him to stop it unless he has a legitimate shar’i excuse that allows him to stop. This woman who started to make up a fast then broke her fast one day with no excuse and made up that day does not have to do anything else, but she has to repent and ask Allah for forgiveness for breaking an obligatory fast with no excuse.”

How can a person with kidney dialysis offer prayer?","Praise be to Allah.Does kidney dialysis affect a person’s fast? 
The Standing Committee was asked: 
Does kidney dialysis affect a person’s fast? 
They replied: 
“We wrote to the Director of the King Faisal Specialist Hospital and the Director of the Armed Forces Hospital in Riyadh to find out more about what is involved in kidney dialysis and whether chemical substances are used, and whether it is regarded as a kind of nourishment. 
They replied as follows: 
(Kidney dialysis involves taking the patient’s blood into a machine (an artificial kidney) which cleans it then returns it to the body. It also adds some chemicals and nutrients such as sugars and salts etc. to the blood.) 
After studying the matter and discovering the nature of kidney dialysis with the help of some experts in the field, the Standing Committee issued a fatwa stating that kidney dialysis invalidates the fast. 
And Allah is the Source of strength. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and Companions.” 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about a person who undergoes kidney dialysis – does having his blood removed during the procedure invalidate his wudu? How should he fast and pray whilst having dialysis done, if that coincides with the time of prayer? 
He replied: 
Does kidney dialysis invalidate wudu?
“With regard to wudu, kidney dialysis does not invalidate wudu, because the correct scholarly view is that what comes out of the body does not invalidate wudu unless it comes out of either the front or back passage. Whatever comes out of those two passages invalidates wudu, whether it is urine, stools or wind. Everything that comes out of the two passages invalidates wudu. 
With regard to that which comes out of anywhere other than the two passages, such as a nosebleed that comes out of the nose, or blood that comes out of a wound, and so on, it does not invalidate wudu whether in small or large quantities. Based on this, kidney dialysis does not invalidate wudu. 
How can a person with kidney dialysis offer prayer?
With regard to prayer, the patient can join Zuhr and `Asr, and Maghrib and `Isha. He can plan his schedule with his doctor, to make sure that the dialysis will not take more than half the day, so that he will not miss praying Zuhr and `Asr on time. He can say to him, for example: Schedule the dialysis in the early afternoon, giving me enough time to pray Zuhr and `Asr, or bring it forward so that I will be able to pray Zuhr and `Asr (afterwards), before the time for `Asr ends. What matters is that it is permissible to combine the prayers without delaying them. Based on this it is essential to plan one’s schedule with one’s doctor. 
With regard to fasting, we are not sure about that. Sometimes I would say that it is not like cupping, because with cupping blood is taken and not returned to the body, and this invalidates the fast as it says in the hadith. 
In dialysis, the blood is taken from the body, cleaned and returned to the body. But I am concerned that dialysis involves some nutrients which take the place of food and drink. If that is the case, then it does invalidate the fast. In that case, if this is a lifelong condition with no hope of recovery, then he should feed one poor person for each day. But if it happens intermittently, then he should not fast when he is undergoing dialysis and make up that day later on. 
But if the substances that are mixed with the blood do not include nutrients, rather they simply cleanse the blood, then this does not break the fast. In this case, he may use dialysis even if he is fasting. He should refer to the doctors about this matter.” (Majmu’ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 20/113) 
In conclusion, a person who is suffering from kidney failure should not fast on the days when he has dialysis, then if he can make up the fast he should do so. If he cannot make up the fasts because he is elderly and cannot fast, then he should not fast and should feed one poor person for each day.

Is it correct for me to enter ihram like them even though I will have my period, which will end when we are in Makkah? From where should I enter ihram in Makkah?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.If a menstruating woman passes the meeqaat with the intention of doing Hajj or ‘Umrah, she is obliged to enter ihram from the meeqaat. It is not permissible for her to delay entering ihram until she reaches Makkah and becomes pure [i.e., her period ends]. 
The Sunnah and scholarly consensus indicate that menstruation does not prevent one from entering ihraam, so a woman may enter ihram even if she is menstruating, but then she should not do ‘umrah until she becomes pure and does ghusl. 
Muslim (1210) narrated from Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah (may Allah be pleased with him) that when Asma’ bint ‘Umays gave birth at Dhu’l-Hulayfah, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) instructed Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) to tell her to do ghusl and enter ihraam. 
Al-Nawawi said: 
This indicates that the ihram of women who are bleeding following childbirth or who are menstruating is valid, and that it is mustahabb for them to do ghusl when entering ihraam. 
Al-Bukhaari (1556) and Muslim (1211) narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), the wife of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), said: We went out with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) on the Farewell Pilgrimage. I came to Makkah when I was menstruating and I did not circumambulate the House or do saa’i between al-Safa and al-Marwah. I complained about that to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and he said: “Undo your braids and comb your hair (i.e., do ghusl) and enter ihram for Hajj…” This was narrated by al-Bukhaari in a chapter entitled: “How menstruating women and women who are bleeding following childbirth should enter ihraam.” 
Al-Nawawi said: 
This indicates that menstruating women, women who are bleeding following childbirth, those who have broken their wudoo’ and those who are junub may do all the actions and say all the words of Hajj except tawaaf and the two rak’ahs to be prayed afterwards. Their standing in ‘Arafah is valid, as are other actions of Hajj. The ghusl that is prescribed for Hajj is prescribed for menstruating women and others whom we have mentioned above. This indicates that tawaaf on the part of a menstruating woman is not valid. There is scholarly consensus on this point. 
It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When menstruating women and women who are bleeding following childbirth come to the meeqaat, they should do ghusl and enter ihram and do all the rituals apart from Tawaaf around the Ka’bah.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 1744; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Sunan Abi Dawood. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in al-Fatawa al-Kubra, 1/447: 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded menstruating women and women who were bleeding following childbirth to enter ihram and recite the Talbiyah etc, and to attend ‘Arafah and recite dhikr and du’aa’, and to stone the Jamaraat remembering Allah, and so on. He did not regard it as makrooh for them to do that, rather that is obligatory for them. 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Majmoo’ al-Fatawa (16/126): 
When a menstruating woman or a woman who is bleeding following childbirth reaches the meeqaat, it is obligatory for her to enter ihraam, if that is for an obligatory Hajj or ‘umrah. If it is a voluntary pilgrimage and she has already performed the Hajj and ‘umrah that are required in Islam, then it is prescribed for her to enter ihram from the meeqaat just like other women who are pure (i.e., not menstruating or bleeding following childbirth). 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: 
A woman whose period begins before she enters ihram can enter ihram while menstruating, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded Asma’ bint ‘Umays, the wife of Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with them both), who gave birth at Dhu’l-Hulayfah, to do ghusl and tie a cloth around herself, and enter ihraam. The same applies to menstruating women, and they should remain in ihram until they become pure (i.e., until their period or nifaas ends and they do ghusl), then they should do tawaaf around the Ka’bah and saa’i.

49994,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/49994,Diagnostic imaging of women by men and its relationship to fasting and touching,"I work in the x-ray field, which includes imaging of women which is required in order to examine female patients. What is the ruling on fasting for the woman who has to have such imaging done – should she break her fast and repeat it later on? What is the ruling on my wudoo’ if I examine a woman for the purpose of imaging, noting that I wear gloves during the examination?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
Having x-rays done does not affect the fast, and it is not regarded as one of the things that invalidate the fast, unless the patient takes medicine or is told by the doctor to eat or drink something before the x-ray (or other procedure), in which case the fast is broken because of eating or drinking.
Secondly:  
Carrying out the examination does not affect the fast of the one who does it. We have already explained in the answer to question no. 20710 and 22757 that the correct scholarly view is that touching a non-mahram woman does not invalidate wudoo’. 
It is not permissible for a man to treat a non-mahram woman or vice versa except in cases of necessity, and necessity should be evaluated in a proper manner. It is not permissible to uncover for the slightest reason or the slightest sickness, and it is not permissible to look at more than the site of pain that needs to be uncovered. And it is not permissible for the medic and the patient to be alone together. The answer to question no. 2198 explains the ruling on men treating women. 
It is haraam for a man to touch a non-mahram woman and vice versa. Putting on gloves makes the matter less serious if it is essential for treatment.
