There are no reports at all that Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) prayed Jumu`ah or ‘Eid prayers when travelling.,"Is Jumu`ah while traveling obligatory?


Can a traveller pray Jumu`ah with the people he is visiting?","Praise be to Allah.Is Jumu`ah while traveling obligatory?
Salat al-Jumu`ah (Friday prayer) is not obligatory on the traveller. This is the opinion of the majority of scholars, including the followers of the four schools of Abu Hanifah, Malik, al-Shafi’i and Ahmad.
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Fatawa (24/178): 
“The correct opinion, without a doubt is that this (Jumu`ah and ‘Eid prayers ) are not obligatory for the traveller. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to travel frequently: he performed ‘Umrah three times, besides the ‘Umrah he performed along with Hajj. He performed his Farewell Pilgrimage accompanied by thousands upon thousands of people, and he went on more than twenty military campaigns, but there are no reports at all that say he prayed Jumu`ah or ‘Eid prayers when travelling; he just prayed two rak’ahs [i.e., shortened prayers] as on all the other days. 
There are also no reports that say he preached a khutbah on a Friday when he was travelling , neither standing on his own two feet or from atop his camel, as he used to do on ‘Eid, or from a pulpit, as he used to do on Fridays. He occasionally used to deliver an address to the people when he was travelling, and this was narrated by them but no-one reported that he delivered a khutbah to them before prayer on a Friday whilst travelling, and no-one reported that he recited Quran aloud on a Friday (i.e., during Salat al-Zuhr, on a journey). Of course, if he had done something out of the ordinary and recited aloud or delivered a khutbah, they would have reported it. On the Day of `Arafah, he delivered a khutbah, then he came down and led them in a two-rak’ah prayer, but no one reported that he recited aloud in that prayer. That khutbah was not for Jumu`ah because if it had been for Jumu`ah, he would have done the same (delivered a khutbah) on every other Friday (when he was travelling); that khutbah was given because it was part of the rituals (of Hajj). Hence all the Muslim scholars said that he would have given a khutbah at ‘Arafah even if it had not been a Friday. This mutawaatir report proves that it was a khutbah for the Day of `Arafah, not for Friday.”
Can a traveller pray Jumu`ah with the people he is visiting?
From the above we know that Jumu`ah is not obligatory for the traveller, all that he has to do is to pray Zuhr. However, if he prays Jumu`ah with the people of the place he is visiting, this is OK. 
It says in al-Sharh al-Kabir (2/154): 
“Whoever of these people, travellers, slaves and women attends Jumu`ah, does not have to pray Zuhr, and we know of no dispute on this point. Their exemption from having to attend Jumu`ah is to make things easy for them, but if they attend, it is OK, as is the case with the sick person. It is preferable for the traveller to attend Jumu`ah, because this is better, and is on the safe side (because some scholars think that Jumu`ah is obligatory for the traveller who is staying in a particular place, but not for the traveller who is on the road), as he comes under the general meaning of the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “O you who believe! When the call is proclaimed for the prayer on the Day of Friday (Jumu`ah prayer), come to the remembrance of Allah, and leave off business (and every other thing), that is better for you, if you did but know!” [al-Jumu`ah 62:9]
We have already stated that the majority of scholars say that generally speaking it is not obligatory.

2910,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2910,Du’aa’s    for infertile couples,I am unable to conceive children due to sterility are there any specific dua'a  to be said in such a case ?,,,"Praise be to Allah.You may pray the duaa of Zakariya (peace be upon him), who said:
Rabbi laa tadharni fardan wa anta khayr ul-waaritheen (O my Lord! Leave me not single (childless), though You are the Best of the inheritors). This is a beautiful duaa which is very appropriate in this case. Also suitable is another prayer of Zakariya: Rabbi hab li min ladunka dhurriyyatan tayyibatan innaka samee al-duaa (O my Lord! Grant me from You a good offspring. You are indeed the All-Hearer of invocation).
The story of Zakariya contains valuable lessons for us. Allaah has told us this story in several places in the Quraan. For example, in Soorat Aal Imraan, where He tells us about Maryam (peace be upon her) He says (interpretation of the meaning):
So her Lord (Allaah) accepted her [Maryam] with goodly acceptance. He made her grow in a good manner and put her under the care of Zakariya. Every time he entered al-mihrab [a praying place or private room] to (visit) her, he found her supplied with sustenance. He said, O Maryam! From where have you got this? She said, This is from Allaah. Verily, Allaah provides sustenance to whom He wills, without limit.
At that time Zakariya invoked his Lord, saying: O my Lord! Grant me from You a good offspring. You are indeed the All-Hearer of invocation.
Then the angels called him, while he was standing in prayer in al-mihrab, (saying): Allaah gives you glad tidings of Yahya, confirming (believing in) the Word from Allaah [i.e., the creation of Eesaa], noble, keeping away from sexual relations with women, a Prophet, from among the righteous.
He said, O my Lord! How can I have a son when I am very old and my wife is barren? Allaah said: Thus Allaah does what He wills.
He said: O my Lord! Make a sign for me. Allaah said: Your sign is that you shall not speak to mankind for three days except with signals. And remember your Lord much, and glorify (Him) in the afternoon and in the morning.[Aal Imraan 3:37-41]
In Soorat Maryam, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
(This is) a mention of the mercy of your Lord to His slave Zakariya.
When he called out to his Lord (Allaah) a call in secret,
Saying, My Lord! Indeed my bones have grown feeble, and grey hair has spread on my head, and I have never been unblest in my invocation to You, O my Lord!
And verily! I fear my relatives after me, since my wife is barren. So give me from Yourself an heir, -
Who shall inherit me, and inherit (also) the posterity of Yaqoob [inheritance of religious knowledge and Prophethood]. And make him, my Lord, one with whom You are well-pleased!
(Allaah said): O Zakariya! Verily, We give you the glad tidings of a son. His name will be Yahya. We have given that name to none before (him).
He said, My Lord! How can I have a son, when my wife is barren, and I have reached the extreme old age?
He said, So (it will be). Your Lord says: It is easy for Me, Certainly, I have created you before, when you had been nothing!
[Zakariya] said: My Lord! Appoint for me a sign. He said, Your sign is that you shall not speak unto mankind for three nights, though having no bodily defect.
Then he came out to his people from al-mihrab [a praying-place or private room] and told them by signs to glorify Allaahs Praises in the morning and in the afternoon.[Maryam 19:2-11]
In Soorat al-Anbiya, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
And (remember) Zakariya, when he cried to his Lord: O my Lord! Leave me not single (childless), though You are the Best of the inheritors.
So We answered his call, and We bestowed upon him Yahya, and cured his wife (to bear a child) for him. Verily, they used to hasten on to do good deeds, and they used to call on Us with hope and fear, and used to humble themselves before Us. [al-Anbiya 21:89-90]
Thinking about the story of Zakariya (peace be upon him) is very beneficial for anyone who is infertile. One may also ponder the story of Ibraaheem and his wife Saarah, whom Allaah rewarded for their patience with Ishaaq when Ibraaheem was very old. He was also given another son, Ismaaeel. Allaah tells us that His khaleel (friend) said (interpretation of the meaning):
All praises and thanks be to Allaah, Who has given me in old age Ismaaeel and Ishaaq. Verily! My Lord is indeed the All-Hearer of invocations.[Ibraaheem 14:39]
In all situations, the Muslim should accept and be content with the decree of Allaah, even if he is to remain infertile for the rest of his life. It could be that his patience may be better for him than a child. Everything that Allaah decrees has wisdom and a reason behind it, and everything is subject to His Will and Command. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
To Allaah belongs the kingdom of the heaven and the earth. He creates what He wills. He bestows female (offspring) upon whom He wills, and bestows male (offspring) upon whom He wills.
Or He bestows both males and females, and He renders barren whom He wills. Verily, He is the All-Knower and is Able to do all things. [al-Shoora 42:49-50]

2912,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2912,Who are the Jews and Christians who will enter Paradise?,"For the time being, I do not have the resources to quote the exact Quranic verse, nor can I tell you what sura it has been taken from. However, I believe it is a  common verse. I understand little Arabic; hence I found that in English. The verse can be interpretted as such:
The godfearing Jews, muslims and christians will not have fear (on that day).
I am not exactly sure of the bracketted phrase.
Now my question to you: is it mistranliteration?
We know that christians and jews in general cannot be hoped to have any
sanction in the life hereafter. So, how do we understand the verse?",,,"Praise be to Allah.What you refer to in your question is mentioned in two similar aayaat
    in the Qur’aan. The first of them is the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily,
    those who believe and those who are Jews and Christians, and Sabians, whoever believes in
    Allaah and the Last Day and do righteous good deeds shall have their reward with their
    Lord, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.” [al-Baqarah 2:62]
The second is the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): “Surely,
    those who believe, those who are the Jews and the Sabians and the Christians –
    whosoever believed in Allaah and the Last Day, and worked righteousness, on them shall be
    no fear, nor shall they grieve.” [al-Maa’idah 5:69]
In order to understand these aayaat correctly, we need to refer to the
    scholars of Tafseer (Qur’aanic commentary). The great Imaam Ismaa’eel ibn
    Katheer, may Allaah have mercy on him, said in his tafseer of the aayah from Soorat
    al-Baqarah:
“Allaah, may He be exalted, points out that whoever of the
    previous nations did well and was obedient, will have a good reward, and this will be the
    case for everyone who follows the Unlettered Prophet [Prophet Muhammad 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) until the Hour comes – he will have eternal
    happiness, and they will not fear what they are going to face, nor will they grieve for
    what they have left behind. As Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘No
    doubt! Verily, the awliya’ of Allaah [i.e., those who believe in the Oneness of
    Allaah and fear Allaah much, and love Allaah much], no fear shall come upon them nor shall
    they grieve.’ [Yoonus 10:62]. And Allaah tells us what the angels say to the
    believers at the time of death (interpretation of the meaning): ‘Verily, those who
    say, “Our Lord is Allaah,” then they istaqaamu [stood straight, i.e.,
    truly followed Islam], on them the angels will descend (at the time of their death)
    (saying): “Fear not, nor grieve! But receive the glad tidings of Paradise which you
    have been promised!”’ [Fussilat 41:30]
As far as the Jews are concerning, their faith meant believing in the
    Tawraat (original Torah) and following the way of Moosa (peace be upon him) until
    ‘Eesa came, after which whoever continued to follow the Torah and the way of Moosa,
    and did not leave this and follow ‘Eesa, was doomed. As far as the Christians are
    concerned, their faith meant believing in the Injeel (original Gospel) and following the
    laws of ‘Eesa; whoever did this was a believer whose faith was acceptable to Allaah,
    until Muhammad 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came, after which whoever
    did not follow Muhammad 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and leave the way
    of ‘Eesa and the Injeel that he had been following before, was doomed. 
The aayah (interpretation of the meaning), “And whoever seeks a
    religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will
    be one of the losers” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:85] is a statement that Allaah will not
    accept any way or deed from anyone, after sending His Final Messenger, except those that
    are in accordance with the laws of Muhammad 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
    him). Prior to this, however, anyone who followed the Prophet of his own time was on the
    Straight Path of salvation. So the Jews were those who followed Moosa (peace be upon him)
    and referred to the Tawraat for judgement at that time. When Allaah sent ‘Eesa (peace
    be upon him), the Children of Israel were obliged to follow him and obey him, and so they
    and others who followed him became Christians.. When Allaah sent Muhammad 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him), as the Final Prophet and a Messenger to all the children
    of Adam, all of mankind was obliged to believe in him and obey him, and refrain from what
    he prohibited. Those who did so are the true believers. The ummah (nation) of Muhammad
    
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) are called the believers because of their
    deep eemaan (faith) and conviction, and because they believe in all the past Prophets and
    in the prophesied events that are yet to come.”
Commenting on the aayah in Soorat al-Baqarah, Ibn Katheer (may Allaah
    have mercy on him) said: 
“What is meant is that every group believed in Allaah and the Last
    Day, which is the appointed Day of Reckoning, and did righteous deeds. But after Muhammad
    
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was sent to both mankind and the jinn,
    true belief can only be in accordance with the way of Muhammad 
 (peace and blessings
    of Allaah be upon him). Whoever follows his way will not fear the future or grieve for
    what they leave behind.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

If it is bidah, then we should remember that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Every bidah is a going-astray and every going-astray will lead to Hell.
(Telephone conversation with Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-Uthaymeen) (al-Bida wal-Muhdathaat wa maa laa aslun lahu, p. 259).
Shaykh Abd al-Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) was also asked the following question: Some people hang up aayaat of the Quran and ahaadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the rooms of their homes or in restaurants or offices. In some hospitals and doctors offices they hang the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): And when I am ill, it is He Who cures me [al-Shuara 26:80], and so on. Is this considered to be the use of amulets which is forbidden in shareeah, knowing that the intention behind it is to seek blessings and ward off the shayaateen, or to remind the forgetful and warn the negligent? Is it like using amulets to put the Mus-haf in one's car in order to seek blessings?
His Eminence replied as follows:
If the intention is as described, to remind people and teach them something beneficial, then there is no harm in that. But if they believe that it is a protection against the shayaateen or jinn, then I know of no basis for this. By the same token, there is no basis for putting the Mus-haf in one's car to protect it, and doing so is not allowed, but if a person puts it in his car so that he can read it sometimes or so that some of his passengers can read it, then this is good and there is nothing wrong with it.

    summed up in the following points:
Definition of hiraabah

Ruling on hiraabah

Punishment for hiraabah

The reasons for the different types of these punishments

Repentance of the muhaarib (person who commits hiraabah)

Definition of hiraabah

Hiraabah means ambushing people and threatening them with weapons and
      so on, in the deserts or in the cities, killing them, terrorizing them and seizing their
      property by force and openly.
Wealth is mentioned specifically because this is what usually happens,
      but the ruling applies also to people who terrorize others for the purposes of rape or
      sodomy.
Ruling on hiraabah
Hiraabah is one of the most serious of major sins, and it is forbidden
    according to the Quraan, the Sunnah and ijmaa (scholarly consensus).
Quraan: The Quraan says (interpretation of the meaning): The
        recompense of those who wage war against Allaah and His Messenger and do mischief in the
        land is only that they shall be killed or crucified or their hands and feet be cut off on
        the opposite sides, or be exiled from the land. That is their disgrace in this world, and
        a great torment is theirs in the Hereafter. Except for those who (having fled away and
        then) come back (as Muslims) with repentance before they fall into your power; in that
        case, know that Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. [al-Maaidah 5:33]

Sunnah: the hadeeth of al-Arniyeen. Anas (may Allaah be pleased
        with him) reported that some people came from Akl or Areenah and avoided
        Madeenah (i.e., they did not want to stay in Madeenah because they were suffering from a
        fever). The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) ordered them to drink the
        urine and milk of milch-camels (for treatment of their fever). They did that, and when
        they got better, they killed the shepherd of the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah
        be upon him) and stole the sheep. This news reached (the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of
        Allaah be upon him) at the beginning of the day, and he sent people in pursuit of them. At
        mid-day, they were brought to him and he commanded that their hands and feet should be cut
        off and their eyes put out, then they were left in al-Harrah begging for water, but no one
        gave them water. (Agreed upon).

Ijmaa: the ummah is agreed that hiraabah is haraam.

Punishments for hiraabah

The punishment for hiraabah is one of the hudood or punishments
    prescribed by shareeah, and the punishment varies according to the severity of the
    crime. This is explained as follows:
Whoever kills someone and steals their property, should definitely be
        killed and crucified, so that everyone will know about him. It is not permitted to forgive
        him, by the consensus of the scholars, as was reported by Ibn al-Mundhir.

Whoever kills but does not steal, should definitely be killed, but not
        crucified.

Whoever steals property but does not kill, his right hand and left foot
        should be cut off at the same time, then the bleeding should be stopped and he should be
        released.

Whoever merely terrorizes people, but does not kill or steal, should be
        banished from the land to another country, where he should be detained until he has
        repented sincerely and is reformed.

The evidence for the above is as follows:
The words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): The
        recompense of those who wage war against Allaah and His Messenger and do mischief in the
        land [al-Maaidah 5:33].

The report narrated from Ibn Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with
        them both), who said: The Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be
        upon him) made a peace treaty with Abu Barzah Hilaal ibn Awaymir al-Aslami. Some
        people came, wanting to embrace Islam, and they were ambushed by the companions of Abu
        Barzah. Then Jibreel (peace be upon him) brought to the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and
        blessings of Allaah be upon him) the revelation of the punishment for killing and stealing
        property, which is to be killed and crucified, and the punishment for killing without
        stealing, which is to be killed Whoever steals property but does not kill should
        have his hand and foot from opposite sides cut off. Whoever becomes Muslim, Islam cancels
        out whatever deeds came before it at the time of shirk. (Tafseer
        al-Tabari, 10/260-261).
      
    
    The reason for different levels of punishment

Different punishments for different degrees of hiraabah have been
      prescribed for a very important reason. Hiraabah may take different forms, as is well
      known, it might not involve only killing, or only stealing. It might involve both stealing
      and killing, or it may involve neither, only terrorizing people. These different forms of
      crime dictate different forms of punishment.
The basic principle in shareeah is that the punishment should fit
      the crime, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): The recompense for an
      evil is an evil like thereof [al-Shoora 42:40]. If these punishments did
      not vary according to the crime, and there was room for choice, this might result in the
      most severe punishment for one whose crime was the least serious, or the lightest
      punishment for one whose crime was most heinous, which is a travesty of justice. The fact
      that punishments vary according to the seriousness of the crime makes perfect common
      sense.
Repentance of the muhaarib
If the muhaarib repents, it can only be either of the following two
    scenarios:
Either he repents before he is caught

In this case, the punishment for hiraabah no longer applies, and he
      should be treated like one who is not a muhaarib. The punishment of banishment,
      amputation, or execution etc., no longer applies, except in cases where the victim or his
      family have the right to demand retribution. The evidence for this is the words of Allaah
      (interpretation of the meaning): The recompense of those who wage war against
      Allaah and His Messenger and do mischief in the land is only that they shall be killed or
      crucified or their hands and feet be cut off on the opposite sides, or be exiled from the
      land. That is their disgrace in this world, and a great torment is theirs in the
      Hereafter. Except for those who (having fled away and then) come back (as Muslims) with
      repentance before they fall into your power; in that case, know that Allaah is
      Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. [al-Maaidah 5:33]
Or he repents after he is caught

In this case the punishment for hiraabah still applies, and indeed the
      ruler is obliged to carry it out, because the exception mentioned in the aayah clearly
      applies only to one who repents before he is caught. It is not too difficult for a person
      who wants to escape the prescribed punishment to feign repentance.
This punishment is part of the Islamic shareeah which Allaah has
    prescribed for every time and place, not just for one particular country or period. The
    Muslims applied this punishment for hiraabah at the time of the Prophet 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) and until the present time. The fact that some of the
    Roman and Pharaonic punishments were similar to those prescribed by Islamic law is of no
    particular significance, good or bad. These Islamic punishments cannot be regarded as
    backward or savage or barbaric at all. Any intelligent person who thinks about the
    severity of the crime of hiraabah and the resulting lack of security in the cities and on
    the road, terrorizing of the populace, robbing and killing, will know for sure that this
    ruling is exactly what these criminals deserve. The one who looks at the way the
    punishments for hiraabah fit the crime exactly will see that this is the essence of
    justice. How can it be otherwise when the One Who has prescribed this law is the Almighty,
    the All-Wise, the All-Knowing, the All-Seeing, the Judge, the Just, the All-Aware? He is
    the Best Disposer of Affairs and the Best of Supporters.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

There are shar’i texts which encourage the wearing of certain colours and forbid the wearing of other colours, such as the following:
Black: Umm Khaalid bint Khaalid said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was brought some clothes, among which was a small black khameesah [garment]. He said, ‘Who do you think we should give this to?’ The people remained silent. Then he said, ‘Bring me Umm Khaalid,’ and she was carried to him. He took the khameesah in his hand and put it on her, and said, ‘May you live long and wear it out.’ There was a green or yellow mark on it, and he said, ‘O Umm Khaalid, this is sanaah (good),’ and sanaah is an Abyssinian word.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari). Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “I saw the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) on the day of the Conquest of Makkah, wearing a black turban.” (Reported by Muslim). ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: “I made a black burdah (cloak) for the Messenger of Allaah ( ) peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and he wore it, but when he sweated in it he detected the smell of wool on it, so he took it off, because he used to like pleasant smells.” (Reported by Abu Dawood. Al-Haakim (4/188) said: it is saheeh according to the conditions of the two shaykhs. Al-Dhahabi agreed with him. Shaykh al-Albaani said in al-Saheehah (5/168, no. 2136): It is as they said. Abu Dawood named a chapter in his Sunan “Bab fi’l-Suwaad (chapter on black clothes)”. The author of ‘Awn al-Ma’bood (11/126) said: The hadeeth indicates that it is permissible to wear black and that there is nothing makrooh in doing so).
Black is permissible for both men and women alike. One of the false innovations (bid’ah) connected to this colour is the practice of deliberately wearing black at times of bereavement, which also involves imitating the Christians. Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen said (Fataawa Islamiyah, 3/313): “Wearing black at times of bereavement is a false symbol that has no basis. At times of bereavement people should do what is commanded in Islam, which is to say ‘Innaa Lillaahi wa inna ilayhi raaji’oon. Allaahumma ajirni fi museebati wa’khluf li khayran minhaa (Truly! To Allaah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return. O Allaah, reward me for my calamity and compensate me with something better than it).’ If a person says this with faith and the hope of reward, Allaah will reward him for that and will replace what he has lost with something better.” He also said: “Allocating certain clothes for mourning is an act of bid’ah (innovation) in our opinion, and because it could indicate that a person is discontent with the decree of Allaah.”
White: Abu Dharr (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “I came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and he was wearing a white garment and was asleep. I came back to him (later), and he had woken up…” (Reported by al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh, in a chapter he called Baab al-Thiyaab al-Beed (Chapter on white clothes)). Al-Bukhaari reported that Sa’d said: “I saw on the left of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and on his right two men wearing white clothes on the day of Uhud. I never saw them before or since.” These two men were Jibreel and Mikaa’eel, as al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar mentioned in al-Fath (10/295). White is a colour recommended (mustahabb) for the living to wear and for the dead to be shrouded in, as was stated in the hadeeth narrated by Ibn ‘Abbaas, who said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Wear your white clothes, for they are the best of your clothes, and shroud your dead in them.’” (Reported by Abu Dawood and al-Tirmidhi; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Ahkaam al-Janaa’iz (p. 82)). White is also the preferred colour for men’s ihraam (special garments for Hajj), which consists of an izaar (lower garment) and a rida’ (upper garment).
Green: Abu Ramthah said: “I saw the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) wearing two green garments.” (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, who said, this is a ghareeb hasan hadeeth, and by al-Nisaa’i, 5224).
Red: It was reported that wearing pure red is forbidden for men, but not for women, because of the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Umar: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade mafdam” (reported by Imaam Ahmad and Ibn Maajah, 3591). Mafdam is something that is filled with red safflower dye. According to the commentary of al-Sindi on Sunan al-Nisaa’i, mafdam is something that is filled with red. It was reported that if ‘Umar saw a man wearing a garment dyed red with safflower, he would pull him aside and say, “Leave this for the women.” (Reported by al-Tabari).
‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Amr said: “A man who was wearing two red garments passed by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and greeted him with salaam, but the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not respond.” (Reported by Abu Dawood and al-Tirmidhi, and classed as hasan by al-Bazzaar, who said: we know it only through this isnaad, which includes Abu Yahya al-Qattaat, who is a disputed figure).
There were several suggestions as to why men are forbidden to wear red, including the following:


because it is the dress of the kuffaar


because it is the adornment of women, so forbidding it is a way of discouraging the imitation of women


because it is vanity and does not befit a decent man to wear it


The prohibition applies only to garments that are dyed completely red. Garments that contain another colour such as white, black, etc. are not forbidden. This is how the ahaadeeth that speak about the red hullah should be interpreted, such as the hadeeth of al-Bara’ (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was of average height. I saw him wearing a red hullah, and I have never seen anything better than it.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 5400). The Yemeni hullah usually has stripes of red and another colour, it is not pure red.
Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: “The clothing (of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)): Abu’l-Waleed told us Shu’bah told us from Abu Ishaaq who heard al-Bara’ (may Allaah be pleased with him) saying: ‘The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was of average height. I saw him wearing a red hullah, and I have never seen anything better than it.’ The hullah consists of an izaar and a rida’ (lower and upper garments)… It is a mistake to think that it was pure red and not mixed with any other colour. The red hullah is two Yemeni garments woven with red and black stripes like all the other Yemeni garments… But pure red is emphatically forbidden. In Saheeh al-Bukhaari it is stated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade red saddlecloths (or blankets) … With regard to red garments in general and red broadcloth, etc., the issue is still under discussion, but it is very disliked (makrooh).” (Zaad al-Ma’aad, 1/139).

Her excuse is that she was too scared. I will wait for your advice.",,,"Praise be to Allah.If what 
          your wife has recently told you is what really happened, then she has 
          committed a major sin and an act of clear betrayal by giving in to this 
          attacker and not trying to escape or stop him or call for help and so 
          on.  Her claim that she was forced to do it is not acceptable, 
          because she makes no mention of being threatened with a weapon or being 
          tied up, etc.  If this is indeed the case, and she clearly did 
          not try to defend herself, then what should you do and how should you 
          regard her?  
There 
          is no doubt that you should warn her and remind her about Allaah and 
          the Last Day and its horrors, and explain to her the seriousness of 
          overstepping the limits set by Allaah and betraying one’s spouse. You 
          should also remind her of the terrible punishment dictated by sharee’ah 
          for the married person who commits adultery, which is stoning to death.  
          
After 
          warning her in this fashion, if you see that she regrets what she did 
          and is striving to be righteous, there is nothing wrong with staying 
          with her, and your marriage will still be valid.  It seems most 
          likely that this woman is indeed sorry for what she did and has repented, 
          because she is the one who has brought up the subject after it had been 
          forgotten, and she has told you about it. Perhaps this is because of 
          her guilty conscience and sincere desire to seek forgiveness from her 
          husband.  The sin that she committed when she was very young and 
          living in the ignorant environment of America, and where she may have 
          resisted at the beginning of the attack, then softened, is nothing like 
          the sin of a woman who goes out of her way to commit it, and plans to 
          do it deliberately. Our advice is that if this woman is now righteous 
          and truly regrets what she did, then you should forgive her, especially 
          as you may by now have children who will suffer if you divorce her.  
          At the same time, you should continue to teach her, keep an eye on her 
          and not stay away from her for too long.  We ask Allaah to acceptance 
          repentance from us all.
 Finally, 
          I want to address a serious matter that you refer to in the second part

          and ask Allaah to help him, and he taught us to do likewise. We should 
          not turn away from the houses of Allaah (mosques) or stop praying and 
          making du’aa’. Where else can you turn in times of trouble and who else 
          can you ask for protection in this crisis? Turn back to Allaah, my brother,

However, if a trustworthy doctor tells a pregnant woman that going for Hajj will pose a risk to her or her baby, she should be prevented from doing Hajj.","Hajj during pregnancy


Hajj rituals that a pregnant woman can’t do


When going to Hajj poses a risk to a pregnant woman, can she go?","Praise be to Allah.Hajj during pregnancy
There is no reason why a pregnant woman should not perform Hajj. A pregnant woman is tahir (pure), she has to pray and fast, and if she is divorced by talaq, her divorce is acceptable according to the Sunnah. 
It is narrated in the Sunnah that Asma bint ‘Umays (may Allah be pleased with her) went out for Hajj with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when she was pregnant and approaching full term, and she gave birth at the miqat. 
‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “Asma bint ‘Umays – the wife of Abu Bakr – gave birth to Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr in Shajarah and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told Abu Bakr to tell her to do ghusl and enter ihram. (Narrated by Muslim, 1209)
Shajarah refers to Dhu’l-Hulayfah, i.e., the miqat from which the people of Madinah enter ihram. 
Al-Nawawi said, concerning what we learn from this hadith: 
“This indicates that the ihram of women who are bleeding following childbirth or who are menstruating is valid and that it is mustahabb for them to do ghusl before entering ihram. There is scholarly consensus that it is obligatory, but our view and that of Malik, Abu Hanifah and the majority of scholars is that it is mustahabb. Al-Hasan and the Zahiri madhhab said that it is obligatory. 
All the actions of Hajj on the part of women who are bleeding following childbirth or who are menstruating are valid, apart from Tawaf and the two rak’ahs following tawaf, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do what the pilgrims do but do not do tawaf.” (Sharh Muslim, 8/133)
Hajj rituals that a pregnant woman can’t do
If a woman has not yet done the obligatory Hajj, then pregnancy is not an excuse for her not to do Hajj, because she can avoid the places where there is too much crowding and pushing and shoving. If she is unable to stone the Jamarat herself, she can delegate someone to do so on her behalf. If she cannot do tawaf and sa’i, then she can do so in a wheelchair, and so on. 
Many people manage to do Hajj in comfort without any hardship. 
When going to Hajj poses a risk to a pregnant woman, can she go?
If a woman is pregnant and trustworthy doctors tell her that going for Hajj will pose a risk to her or her baby because she is sick or weak or for some other reason, then she should be prevented from doing Hajj that year. This is indicated by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “There should be no harming nor reciprocating harm.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah, 2340; this is a hasan hadith. For details of its isnad, please see Jami’ al-‘Uloom wa’l-Hikam by Ibn Rajab, 1/302) 
Some doctors differentiate between early pregnancy, when there may be a risk to the foetus, and late pregnancy when such fears are groundless.

      Is it halal or not for a Muslim to drive a taxi because a member of the
      opposite sex might be alone in the car with him which would be khulwah?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)
    said: “No man is ever alone with a woman (khulwah) but the Shaytaan is the third one
    with them.” (Reported by Ahmad and by al-Tirmidhi in his Sunan, 2091; Saheeh
    al-Jaami’, 2546). Allaah says in the story of Yoosuf, peace be
    upon him (interpretation of the meaning): “And she, in whose house he was, sought
    to seduce him (to do an evil act), she closed the doors and said, ‘Come on, O
    you’…” [Yoosuf 12:23]
    It is not permitted for a man to be alone with a woman to whom he is not
    related, whether this is in a house, office, clinic, elevator, car or any other place,
    because this may be the cause of him doing something haraam. Shaytaan is keen to tempt
    people and make them fall into haraam deeds. The fuqaha’ are agreed that khulwah or
    being alone with a woman to whom one is not related is forbidden. They said: “No man
    should be alone with a woman who is not his mahram (a close relative to whom marriage is
    forbidden) or his wife, but is a stranger to him, because the Shaytaan will whisper to
    them and tempt them to do something that is not permitted. (Al-Mawsoo’ah
    al-Fiqhiyyah, 19/267) It is not permitted for a man to be alone with a
    non-mahram woman even if he is teaching her Qur’aan, or to lead her in prayer if only
    the two of them are present. The guideline regarding khulwah is that this prohibition
    applies in any situation where their figures are hidden from other people (Fath
    al-Baari, 9/333). A taxi driver is bound to pass through empty streets
    or highways, and the structure of the car conceals most of the body of a person riding in
    it. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that a forbidden conversation will not take place,
    or that there will not be an agreement to do something forbidden. How many tragedies and
    painful stories and disasters have occurred because of a driver being alone with a female
    passenger! The wise sharee’ah of Islam has taken all precautions to avoid anything
    that may lead to wrongdoing. It is essential to completely avoid any situation where a man
    and woman who are not related may be alone together. A taxi driver should not accept a
    female passenger who is alone, except in cases of emergency such as accidents and the
    like. And Allaah is the Source of strength.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

He told me that if he pursues his specialty – i.e., mathematics and physics – this will keep him from studying the Islamic sciences in depth. He is debating which of the two options will be best for him. What do you advise, may Allaah reward you?",,,"Praise be to Allah.You brother could continue his studies in the
      specialty mentioned, and also study Islamic sciences with one of the
      scholars, or after completing his studies, he could join one of the
      institutes or colleges of sharee’ah in order to learn about his religion
      and gain knowledge and understanding of sharee’ah. If he fears that
      continuing to study mathematics will keep him from studying sharee’ah,
      he can give that up and occupy himself with Islamic studies, because this
      is more important and more beneficial, and because he was created to
      worship his Lord with insight. There is no way to do this except by the
      help of Allaah and then by studying the sciences of sharee’ah. May
      Allaah makes matters easy for him and bless him in his studies.","From Fataawaa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 12/102"
