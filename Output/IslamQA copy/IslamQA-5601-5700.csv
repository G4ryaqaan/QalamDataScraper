5638,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/5638,Some    people claim that there is an aayah which supports Sufism,"Salam, can you explan surah 4 verse 69...some people say this is what makes sufism allowed. I have read your answer on sufism and agree, but can you please examplain this verse?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The aayah which you are asking about is the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):
“And whoso obey Allaah and the Messenger (Muhammad  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)), then they will be in the company of those on whom Allaah has bestowed His Grace, of the Prophets, the Siddeeqoon (those followers of the Prophets who were first and foremost to believe in them, like Abu Bakr As-Siddeeq), the martyrs, and the righteous. And how excellent these companions are!” [al-Nisaa’ 4:69]
Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his Tafseer:
This means, whoever acts in accordance with the commands of Allaah and His Messenger, and keeps away from whatever Allaah and His Messenger forbid, then Allaah will give him a home in the abode of His generosity, and cause him to be in the company of the Prophets and those who come after them in status, the Siddeeqoon, then the martyrs, then the rest of the believers, who are the righteous who do righteous deeds secretly and openly. Then Allaah praises them, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And how excellent these companions are!” [al-Nisaa’ 4:69]
Al-Bukhaari narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “There is no Prophet who fell sick, but Allaah gave him the choice between this world and the Hereafter.” When he fell ill with his final sickness, his voice became very hoarse, and I heard him saying, ‘in the company of those on whom Allaah has bestowed His Grace, of the Prophets, the Siddeeqoon (those followers of the Prophets who were first and foremost to believe in them, like Abu Bakr As-Siddeeq), the martyrs, and the righteous.’ Then I knew that he had been given the choice.”
(Tafseer Ibn Katheer).
Then he (Ibn Katheer – may Allaah have mercy on him) mentioned something about the reason why this aayah was revealed. Then he said:
Greater than all of this is the glad tidings which were reported in the books of Saheeh and Musnad, etc., through mutawaatir isnaads from a number of the Sahaabah: that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was asked about a man who loves some people but cannot catch up with them – i.e. he cannot attain the same level as them in doing righteous deeds. He  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “A man will be with those whom he loves.” Anas ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: the Muslims never rejoiced as much as they did when they heard this hadeeth. I love the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and I love Abu Bakr and ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with them both), and I hope that Allaah will resurrect me with them even though I did not do what they did.
So, as you can see, there is nothing in this aayah that justifies the Sufis and their madhhab.
If the Sufis are sincere, then let them obey Allaah and his Messenger and adhere to His Sharee’ah – as commanded in this aayah – so that they will be among the victorious. As for their claims that the awliyaa’ (“saints”) have knowledge of the Unseen (al-ghayb), which no one knows but Allaah, and their doing Tawaaf around graves and praying to the dead as a means of worship and drawing closer to Allaah – all of this in fact means that they are seeking the help of someone other than Allaah and this is kufr and shirk. They say, “Allaah inspires us with things which He casts into our hearts in addition to what is in the Qur’aan and Sunnah”; and they say that the “elite” do not have to adhere to the Sharee’ah of Islam which is obligatory for the “masses”; and they invent adhkaar (phrases remembering Allaah) which they repeat regularly, which are not in the Qur’aan or in the Sunnah of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him… and after all this, they want to be among the victorious, with the Prophets and Siddeeqoon. On the contrary, they will be with the shayaateen (devils) and mushrikeen. We ask Allaah to keep us safe and sound. May Allaah bless us and you with the love for His Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him and love for his noble companions, and gather us with them in the place of honour with Him, for He is the Sovereign, the One Who is able to do all things.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

    Hell on the wall when he prayed Salaat al-Kusoof (the eclipse prayer), and he
    almost brought his companions a bunch of grapes from the fruits if Paradise, even though
    the distance between earth and Paradise is so immense. The One Who brought the place near

5644,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/5644,His father wants him to marry his cousin who is close in age to him,"Alhamdo Lillah I am a practicing muslim and I am also involved in the work of Tabligh and Dawah. One thing that always gets me and makes me feel that I am not doing enough for my deen and my life hereafter is when I think about my Father. 
My Father is a good practicing muslim and it is from him that I have learned about Islam. I have three brothers all of them are elder to me and all of them are married. We had a great family and great atmosphere at home until it was time for the brothers to get married. My father wanted them to marry my cousins, but my brothers were against it and they were married to other girls who were not from our relatives. So now my father does not have the same attitude towards them and he always tries to elude them and ignore them. I was terrified to see him act like this as he is a staunch muslim  and respects Islam and it's teaching. 
Now it is time for my marriage and he wanted me to marry one of my cousins. Now the problem that I am facing here is that me and my cousin we were kind of close as we were of nearly same age and did most of the schooling together. So I have known her mostly as a good sister and now my dad wanted me to marry her and I was in a state of jeopardy. I am very much aware of the rights of one's dad and that he is the doorway to my Jannah. 
The problem with my dad is that he does not say anything and he just behaves as if I do not exist. He would talk to me and everything but like a stranger and infront of others he would behave as if nothing is wrong, but that kind of attitude is killing me and I think that he is really pissed off with me. The question is about my life and who I would like to spend my life with, but on the other hand I run the risk of spoiling my Akirah by making my dad unhappy. 
My question is how do I handle this problem? How do I get my dad to be the same old self as he was, please guide me in this regards",,,"Praise be to Allah.Note 
          that is is impossible for things to stay the same forever. Glory be 
          to the One Who changes His slaves’ circumstances and directs them as 
          He wills. Our advice to you concerning this problem is first to think 
          of marrying the relative whom your father has suggested that you marry, 
          regardless of the   previous knowledge to which you refer.  
          If she more or less has the qualities that you want in a righteous wife 
          and she does not have any bad quality that you think you could not put 
          up with, then marry her. Perhaps Allaah will decree much good for you 
          in that, and your honouring your father will be the cause of happiness 
          in your marriage.
  
          But if there is an obvious fault that means that you could  not 
          marry her, then explain that to your father and try to convince him 
          that forcing a man to choose a wife whom he does not like could cause 
          the marriage to fail and could also cause harm to that girl. Advise 
          your brothers to try to honour your father and keep in touch with him 
          so as to strengthen the family ties and put right what has changed.

    volume of music for one’s parents with a remote control","What is the ruling on handing the remote to
      your mother/father to put music on t.v?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Turning up the volume of music for one’s parents with
    a remote control
That is not permissible because it involves cooperating in sin, and
    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“… but do not help one another in sin and
    transgression.” [al-Maa’idah 5:2]
If you withhold the remote control and they get angry, they have no
    right to do so, because the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
    “There is no obedience to any created being if it involves disobedience to the
    Creator.” (Reported by Imaam Ahmad, 1041; it is a saheeh hadeeth).
    The remote control you mention is merely a tool, the
    person who is doing the action is you, and the responsibility rests with you. You have to
    call your parents to give up evil things, inviting them with wisdom and beautiful
    preaching, addressing them kindly and lowering to them the wing of humility. If Allaah
    told Moosa and Haaroon to address the kaafir tyrant Pharaoh with kindness, as He said
    (interpretation of the meaning), “And speak to him mildly, perhaps he may accept

Many non- Muslim classmates come up to me and ask me questions about Islam and this usually takes place in private. Is this right for the sake of them converting?,,,"Praise be to Allah.You have to call whoever you can to Islam and to enter the religion of Allaah.

All of this should be done on the basis of sound knowledge, evidence and proofs of which you have a firm and proper knowledge, and it should be done with wisdom and beautiful preaching, responding to the kaafirs with that which is better.

You must beware of forming relationships with women, and you should be aware of the ways in which the Shaytaan introduces evil, whereby you efforts to make dawah and draw closer to Allaah by offering advice to kaafir women may end up with you being tested and tempted by them. Dawah to non-Muslim women should either be undertaken by Muslim women, or else by a Muslim man giving them tapes and booklets, or by giving public speeches and lectures without deliberately looking at the women.

5660,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/5660,Adhaan    and Iqaamah when praying alone,Do you say the Adzan and the iquamah when you pray alone? I have just embraced Islam and I read books on Salaat and they do not say.,,,"Praise be to Allah.It is mustahabb (recommended, encouraged) for the person who is praying alone to say the Adhaan and Iqaamah, because of the general meaning of the reports that refer to them.
Al-Shaykh Mansoor al-Bahwati (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:
“They (the Adhaan and Iqaamah) are Sunnah (for the person who is praying alone) because of the general meaning of the hadeeth of ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Aamir, who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Your Lord likes it when a shepherd at the top of a mountain pass calls the Adhaan for prayer and then prays. Then Allaah says, “Look at this slave of mine, saying the Adhaan and the Iqaamah for prayer and fearing Me. I ask you to bear witness that I have forgiven My slave and will admit him to Paradise.”’” (Narrated by al-Nisaa’i). The Adhaan and Iqaamah are also Sunnah for travellers, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to Maalik ibn al-Huwayrith and his cousin: “When you two travel, say the Adhaan and Iqaamah for prayer, and let the elder of you lead the prayer.” (Agreed upon). Mutaalib Oolaial-Nuha, part 1, Baab al-Adhaan.
It is makrooh (disliked) for him to neglect the Adhaan and Iqaamah. Al-Shaafa’i (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:

Du’a before Iqamah


Du’a between adhan and iqamah  


Du`a after iqamah


Du’a during adhan


Du'a during iqamah","Praise be to Allah.Du’a before Adhan
With regard to du’a before the adhan , there is no du’a to be recited before the adhan as far as I know. If this time is singled out for any type of du’a, this is a reprehensible innovation (bid’ah). But if it is done by coincidence and accidentally, then there is nothing wrong with it. 
Du’a before Iqamah
With regard to before the iqamah, when the muadhdhin (caller to prayer) is about to start the iqamah, we know of no specific words to be recited at this time. Doing so when there is no solid shar’i (religious legal) evidence is a reprehensible innovation (bid’ah).
Du’a between adhan and iqamah  
With regard to the time between the adhan and iqamah, du’a is encouraged at this time and it is mustahabb (preferred). 
Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Du’a is not rejected between the adhan and iqamah, so engage in du’a (supplication).” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 212; Abu Dawud, 437; Ahmad, 12174 – this version narrated by him. Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud, 489). 
There is a specific du’a to be said immediately after the adhan: 
Jabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever says when he hears the call to prayer : ‘Allahumma Rabba hadhihi’l-da’wat il-tammah wa’l-salat il-qaimah, ati Muhammadan il wasilata wa’l-fadilah, wab’athhu maqaman mahmudan illadhi wa’adtah (O Allah, Lord of this perfect call and the prayer to be offered, grant Muhammad the privilege (of intercession) and also the eminence, and resurrect him to the praised position that You have promised),’ my intercession for him will be permitted on the Day of Resurrection.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 589)
Du`a after iqamah
With regard to du’a after the iqamah, we know of no evidence for this. If any specific du’a is made in the absence of any sound evidence, it is an innovation (bid’ah). 
Du’a during adhan
With regard to du’a at the time of the adhan, it is Sunnah to repeat what the muadhdhin is saying , except when he says “Hayya ‘ala’l-salah, hayya ‘ala’l-falah (Come to prayer, come to success),” when you should say ‘La hawla wa la quwwata illa Billah (there is no power and no strength except with Allah).”  
 ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If the muadhdhin says ‘Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar’ and one of you says, ‘Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar’; then he says ‘Ashhadu an la ilaha ill-Allah’ and you say ‘Ashhadu an la ilaha ill-Allah’; then he says, ‘Ash-hadu anna Muhammadan Rasul Allah’ and you say, ‘Ash-hadu anna Muhammadan Rasul Allah’; then he says, ‘Hayya ‘ala’l-salah’ and you say ‘La hawla wa la quwwata illa Billah’; then he says, ‘Hayya ‘ala’l-falah’ and you say ‘La hawla wa la quwwata illa Billah’; then he says, ‘Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar’ and you say, ‘Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar’; then he says ‘La ilaha ill-Allah’ and you say, ‘La ilaha ill-Allah’ from the heart, you will enter Paradise.” (Narrated by Muslim, 385). 
Du'a during iqamah
With regard to saying du’a at the time of the iqamah, some scholars regard it as being like the adhan , so it is mustahabb to repeat the words. Other scholars do not regard it as mustahabb, because of the weakness of the hadith which speaks of repeating the words of the iqamah. These scholars include al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim, in al-Fatawa, 2/136, and al-Shaykh al-‘Uthaymin in al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 2/84. 
Can we say ‘Aqamaha Allah wa adamaha Allah’ during iqamah?
It is a mistake to say “Aqamaha Allah wa adamaha Allah” when the muadhdhin says “Qad qamat il-salah,” because the hadeeth narrated concerning this is da’if (weak). 
It was narrated from Abu Umamah (may Allah be pleased with him) or from one of the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that Bilal (may Allah be pleased with him) began to recite the iqamah and when he said, “Qad qamat il-salah,” the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Aqamaha Allah wa adamaha Allah.” And he said concerning the rest of the iqamah something like what is mentioned in the hadith of ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) about the adhan. (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 528. This hadith was classed as da’if (weak) by al-Hafiz ibn Hajar in al-Talkhis al-Habir, 1/211)

My friend mentioned that her teacher said that a Muslim doctor whether male or female should be the first choice, and then a non-Muslim male or female.
I am puzzled. I understand that as Muslim doctors, they should be more amanah than non-Muslims but shouldn't the point about aurat figure more importantly, and hence the avoidance of fitnah?

Please advice ustaz.
thanks
may Allah bless you for your help, InsyaAllah.",,,"Praise be to Allah.the Lord of the Worlds, and peace and blessings be upon the one who was sent as a Mercy to the worlds, our Prophet Muhammad, and upon all his family and companions.
There follows a number of principles and guidelines on the issue of: Looking for the purposes of medical treatment.
Firstly: the awrah [that which should be covered] of a man is the area between the navel and the knees, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: What is between the navel and the knees is awrah.
(A hasan hadeeth narrated by Ahmad, Abu Dawood and al-Daaraqutni). This is the view of the majority of scholars.
Secondly: all of a woman is awrah and is to be covered before strangers (non-mahrams), because of the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):
And when you ask (his wives) for anything you want, ask them from behind a screen [al-Ahzaab 33:53]
and because of the hadeeth, All of a woman is awrah.
(Narrated by al-Tirmidhi with a saheeh isnaad).
This is the correct view according to the madhhab of the Hanbalis, one of the two views of the Maalikis and one of the two views of the Shaafais.
Thirdly: deliberately looking at awraat is one of the things that are strongly forbidden. One is required to lower the gaze and refrain from looking at them, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts). That is purer for them. Verily, Allah is All-Aware of what they do. And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts) [al-Noor 24:30-31]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: A man should not look at the awrah of another man and a woman should not look at the awrah of another woman.
(Narrated by Muslim).
And he said to Ali (may Allah be pleased with him): Do not look at the thigh of anyone, living or dead.
(Narrated by Abu Dawood; it is a saheeh hadeeth).
Fourthly: if it is not permissible to look at awraat it is also not permissible to touch any of them, even when there is some cloth or clothing in between. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: I do not shake hands with women.
(Narrated by Maalik and Ahmad. This is a saheeh hadeeth). And he said: If one of you were to be stabbed in the head with an iron needle, this would be better for him than if he were to touch a woman whom it is not permitted for him to touch. (Narrated by Tabaraani; it is a saheeh hadeeth). Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Where it is forbidden to look it is also forbidden to touch, and is more forbidden, because that is more pleasurable.
Fifthly: things that are considered to be awrah are of varying types and degrees. The thing that is most awrah is the private parts, front and back. Then there are things that are less awrah such as a man's thighs in front of another man.
Sixthly: young children under the age of seven are not subject to the rulings on awrah. The awrah of boys who are able to distinguish matters between the ages of seven and ten is the private parts, and the awrah of girls of the same age is the area from the navel to the knees. (All of this is in cases where there is no fear of fitnah). The awrah of a dead person is the same as the awrah of a living person. To be on the safe side, a hermaphrodite (person whose sex is not clear) should be considered to be a woman in terms of awrah, because such a person may be a woman.
Sixthly: in cases of necessity, things that are ordinarily forbidden are permitted. The scholars are agreed that it is permissible for a male doctor to look at the site of illness in a woman when necessary, within the limits set by shareeah. Similarly, a male doctor may look at the awrah of a sick man. But he should look at the site of the complaint only as much as is necessary (and no more). The rulings apply to female doctors as to male doctors. This ruling is based on the idea of giving priority to the principle of saving life over the principle of covering the awrah, in cases where there is a conflict between the two.
Seventhly: Necessity should be evaluated according to its degree. Although it is permissible to uncover, look and touch, etc., for the purposes of treatment in cases of urgent necessity, it is not permissible under any circumstances to go beyond the Islamic limits or ignore the regulations set out by shareeah. These regulations are as follows:


Priority should be given to the treatment of men by men and women by women. When a sick women needs to be uncovered (for medical treatment), preference should be given to a qualified female Muslim doctor; if such is not available, the order of preference is then a female non-Muslim doctor, a male Muslim doctor, and lastly, a male non-Muslim doctor. If it is sufficient to be treated by a female general practitioner (GP), she should not go to a male doctor even if he is a specialist. If a specialist is needed, she should go to a female specialist, but if one is not available, then the female patient may uncover in front of a male specialist. If the female specialist is not qualified to treat the problem and the situation calls for the involvement of a highly-skilled, qualified male specialist, then this is permissible. If there is a male specialist who is more highly-skilled and more experienced than the female doctor, the female patient should still not go to him unless the situation requires this extra level of experience and skill. By the same token, a man should not be treated by a woman if there is a man who is able to carry out the treatment.


It is not permissible to uncover more than is necessary; only the area that needs to be examined should be uncovered. At the same time, the doctor should try to lower his gaze as much as he can, and he should be aware that he is doing something which is basically forbidden, and he should seek the forgiveness of Allah for anything he may do which oversteps the mark.


If describing the problem is sufficient, then it is not permissible to uncover; if it is possible to examine the site of the problem by just looking, then it is not permissible to touch; if it is possible to examine by touching with a cloth over the site, then it is not permissible to remove the cloth, and so on.


In allowing a woman to be treated by a male doctor, it is conditional that she not be alone in the room with him. So the woman has to be accompanied by her husband, mahram or another woman who is trustworthy.


The male doctor must also be trustworthy and above suspicion with regard to his character and religious commitment. In this case it is sufficient to take people at face value.


The more something is regarded as awrah, the more strictly should the rules be applied. The author of Kafaayat al-Akhyaar said: Know that the basic idea in cases of need is to look at the face and hands. In order to look at the rest of the body, there should be a certain and definite need, and in order to look at the private parts, there should be an extra-certain need. Hence one should be extremely strict in cases such as childbirth and the circumcision of young girls.


The need for treatment should be urgent, such as sickness, unbearable pain, worrying weakness and so on. If there is no sickness or urgency, then it is not permissible to uncover the awrah, such as in cases where a person imagines he is sick or in cases of cosmetic issues.


All of the above applies only in cases where there is no fear of fitnah or provocation of desire on the part of either the doctor or the patient.


Finally, it is essential to remember and fear Allah with regard to this important matter. The shareeah has set out many precautions in order to be on the safe side, and has prescribed clear and serious guidelines. One of the most widespread problems of our times is the lax attitude that people have taken towards the issue of uncovering the awrah in clinics and hospitals, as if it is permissible to show everything to a doctor and to do any forbidden thing in his presence. The same applies to educational programs which are brought without censorship from the kaafir countries, imitating them by taking a lax attitude to such matters in the case of education, training and information.
The Muslims have to pay attention to educating qualified women in the various specialties, so that needs may be met. They should also draw up schedules and organize shifts in hospitals and clinics in such a way that Muslim women need never be put in an awkward position, or feel neglected or be subjected to the annoyance of a male doctor when she asks for a female doctor to treat her.
We ask Allah to help us to understand our religion properly and to help us to follow the rules of shareeah and take care of the rights of the Muslims. And He is the Source of help and the Guide to the Straight Path.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
