    between slaves and prostitutes","I've heard that it is allowed for men to
      have intercourse with their slaves. Does that stand for women too, & if men can have
      intercourse with their slaves (the ones they have bought) then why is it so much ill
      thought of the prostitutes...they too are, kind of bought at others will, for shorter time
      period perhaps. Can you make all this clear & why is it so that Islam did not stop
      slavery....they are humans as well, & are against their will kept in captivity &
      against their will may be forced into intercourse?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Slavery in Islam was originally prescribed because of
    Kufr. If there is jihaad between the Muslims and the kuffaar, and a number of kuffaar are
    taken prisoner, the commander is given the choice of sharing them out, doing them a favour
    (by releasing them) or paying their ransom. If they are shared out as part of the booty,
    they become slaves, subject to the laws governing products which may be sold. But at the
    same time, Islam urges the freeing of slaves and makes doing so an act of expiation for
    numerous sins. In principle, slavery is not something that is desirable; what is
    encouraged in Islam is the freeing of slaves. If a woman is enslaved according to
    shareeah, it is permissible for her master to have intercourse with her. This is
    unlike prostitution or zinaa, which Islam has forbidden as a precaution against mixing
    lineages and other reasons for which it is forbidden. There is no comparison between the
    two, because if a slave woman becomes pregnant, the child belongs to the master and she
    becomes free when he dies, because she has become the mother of the masters child (umm
    walad), and is subject to the same rulings as a wife. And Allaah knows best.",Written by al-Khudayr
5709,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/5709,The times of the prayers are close together in the North – is it permissible to put them together?,"I would like to know the options muslims would take with regards to the J'amaah Prayers in the following situation :- 
      Maghrib time 10:00p.m
      Isha time 11:15p.m
      Fajer 1:50a.m
      To explain more my question, I would like to know the fatwa into options muslims would
      take when the times of the Maghrib,Isha and Fajer are extreemley close to each other. So
      therefore, is it allowed to pray Maghrib & Isha together or what ? And if yes what is
      the Proof from the Qura'an & Sunnah , and if no , still what is the proof ?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The time of Maghrib prayer lasts from sunset until the
    red afterglow disappears; the time of ‘Ishaa’ prayer lasts from after the red
    afterglow has disappeared until midnight; the time of Fajr prayer lasts from the second
    dawn until sunrise. The evidence (daleel) for this is the hadeeth of ‘Abd-Allaah ibn
    ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas in Saheeh Muslim in which this is mentioned. So long as
    the times of the prayers are distinct from one another, each prayer must be performed in
    its own time, even if the times are close together. Being patient in doing this is a kind
    of jihaad, and Allaah does not cause the reward of the one who does good to be lost.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
5710,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/5710,Should a woman    wish that she was a man?,"I wanted to ask this that men get to have many hoors in paradise, why is it not the same for women? Infact they would have to share one husband with several others( hoors & wives). Is there something else of this sort that I don't know of. I do know there will be much more in Paradise than just marriage & there husbands. But still i would like this question to be answered...it has been in my mind for quite some while.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Some of the female Sahaabah wished that they were men so that they could fight in jihaad for the sake of Allaah. Then Allaah revealed (interpretation of the meaning):
And wish not for the things in which Allaah has made some of you to excel others. For men there is reward for what they have earned, (and likewise) for women there is reward for what they have earned, and ask Allaah of His Bounty. Surely, Allaah is Ever All-Knower of everything [al-Nisaa 4:32]
Allaah forbade woman to wish for the things that are the exclusive preserve of men, for Allaah has given men a certain share of deeds in this world and they will have a corresponding share of reward in the Hereafter and the same applies to women. So ask Allaah, the Most Generous Bestower to give you of His bounty, instead of indulging in wishful thinking, for Allaah knows best what is suited to His slaves in the way in which He shares out good things among them.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
5733,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/5733,Short Temper and Cursing One You are Angry With,"I get angry easily and at times I go in a rage and start cursing the person I am angry at in private. When I cool down, I say ""astaghfirullah,"" and I keep making an intention to not do it again. I know cursing is haram (impermissible). I hate what I do, and I wish I can control myself. I want to know how one repents for cursing someone in anger. The person does not hear me say these things but I still feel bad about them. And do I have to tell the person that I cursed them in private? Can I just keep it to myself as to not create animosity between me and the person? Can I give sadaqah (charity) to cancel the harm I did? What do I need to do to fix the problem? I want to stop, and I keep making du’a (supplicating) - but for now I want to repent for the times I cursed people in anger. Also does Allah accept my curses in anger? I am feeling very depressed over this issue. I feel bad when I stand for prayer. I wish to really repent and feel content about my repentance.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    
    You have to restrain your anger, because Allah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    
    “…who repress anger, and who pardon men; verily, Allah loves Al-Muhsinoon 
    (the good‑doers).”

    
    [3:134] 

    
    “And those who avoid the greater sins, and Al‑Fawahish (illegal sexual 
    intercourse), and when they are angry, they forgive.” 

    
    [42:37]

    
    This is because when a person does not restrain his anger, he insults, 
    curses, swears and hits. Anger may be a door to all kinds of evil. The 
    Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) often advised people not 
    to get angry. Al-Bukhari narrated in al-Saheeh from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah 
    be pleased with him) that a man said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of 
    Allah be upon him), “Advise me.” He said: “Do not get angry.” The man 
    repeated his request several times, and he said, “Do not get angry.” 
    

    
    The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) regarded the one who 
    controls himself when he is angry as being the strongest of men. Al-Bukhari 
    narrated in al-Saheeh that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of 
    Allah be upon him) said: “The strong man is not the one who can wrestle 
    (fight); the strong man is the one who controls himself at the time of 
    anger.” 

    
    Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) made some important points 
    in Fath al-Bari in his commentary on the hadeeth (narration) “Do not get 
    angry”. He said: 

    
    “Al-Tabarani quoted the hadeeth of Sufyan ibn ‘Abd-Allah al-Thaqafi: I said, 
    O Messenger of Allah, tell me something that will be of benefit to me, and 
    make it brief and concise. He said, “Do not get angry, and Paradise will be 
    yours.” It was also narrated that Abu’l-Darda said: I said, O Messenger of 
    Allah, tell me of a deed which will earn me admission to Paradise. He said, 
    “Do not get angry…” Al-Khattabi said: The meaning of the phrase ‘Do not get 
    angry’ is: Avoid the things that cause anger and do not expose yourself to 
    that which provokes it. Anger itself could not have been forbidden, because 
    it is something natural which cannot be removed from human nature. Someone 
    else said: What is meant is that which can be achieved by training oneself… 
    It was said that it means: Do not do that which anger provokes you to do.
    

    
    Ibn Battal said: The hadeeth indicates… that striving to control oneself is 
    more difficult than striving against the enemy, because the Prophet (peace 
    and blessings of Allah be upon him) described the one who controls himself 
    at times of anger as being the strongest of people. Someone else said: 
    Perhaps the person who asked this question was hot-tempered; the Prophet 
    (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to command each person to do 
    that which was most appropriate for him, so he summed up his advice to this 
    person by telling him not to get angry. Ibn al-Teen said: in the words ‘Do 
    not get angry’, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) 
    brought together the good of this world and of the Hereafter, because anger 
    results in cutting off ties and withholding kindness, and it may lead to one 
    doing harm to the person with whom one is angry, which diminishes one’s 
    religious commitment. 

    
    One of the scholars said: Allah created anger from fire, and made it an 
    instinct in man. When there is a dispute, the flames of anger are fanned 
    until a person’s face and eyes become red, because the skin reflects what is 
    underneath it… Anger produces external and internal changes, such as a 
    change in colour, trembling, uncontrolled actions and a change in 
    appearance, such that if the angry person could see himself when he is 
    angry, he would feel ashamed of his ugly appearance and the way his 
    appearance has changed. All of this is what happens on the outside. The 
    internal effects are even worse, because it generates hatred in the heart, 
    envy (hasad) and all kinds of bad feelings. The most ugly effects of anger 
    are the internal effects, and the external changes are the results of the 
    internal changes. All of this has an effect on the body. The effect on the 
    tongue is that it speaks words of slander and foul language which the wise 
    person would feel ashamed of, and the angry person regrets them when he 
    calms down. The effects of anger can also be seen in people’s actions, when 
    they beat and kill others. If the angry person does not have the chance to 
    do that, he turns his anger against himself, tearing his garments and 
    slapping his cheeks; sometimes he may have a seizure, or fall unconscious, 
    or break vessels, or hit someone who has not done anything wrong. Whoever 
    thinks about these evil actions will realize just how much wisdom there is 
    in these gentle words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon 
    him), ‘Do not get angry,’  and to how great an extent they protect people’s 
    interests by warding off this great evil which may otherwise lead who knows 
    where. 

    
    All of this has to do with anger for the sake of worldly things, not anger 
    for the sake of religious matters… (Anger for the sake of Allah is 
    praiseworthy and recommended, such as anger when seeing evil actions). It 
    helps a person not to get angry when he bears in mind what has been narrated 
    concerning the virtues of restraining anger, and the warnings concerning the 
    results of anger; he should also seek refuge with Allah from the Shaytan 
    (devil)… and do wudhu (ablution)… And Allah knows best.” 

    
    Remember, too, that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) 
    was not a person who insulted or cursed others. It was reported in Saheeh 
    al-Bukhari that Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The 
    Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was not a person who 
    insulted people or used obscene language, and he did not curse people. If he 
    wanted to rebuke anyone, he would say, “What is wrong with him? – may his 
    forehead be rubbed with dust.” 

    
    You must repent to Allah for any curses and aggressive words that you have 
    uttered, but there is no need to tell those whom you have cursed, so as not 
    to provoke any evil actions. You can ask their forgiveness in a general way. 
    With regard to the people whom you have prayed against, pray for good things 
    for them, especially if you have been unfair to them in your prayers against 
    them when they did not deserve such a thing. Ask Allah to be kind to you, 
    for a person’s duas (supplications) may come back on him if he prays against 
    someone who does not deserve them. You must keep your tongue busy with du’a 
    and dhikr (remembrance of Allah), because this brings peace to the heart. “… 
    Verily, in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest” [13:28 – 
    interpretation of the meaning]. Keep away from using your tongue to hurt 
    other people.

5770,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/5770,Placement of the hands in prayer between Ahl al-Sunnah and others,"I am confused between the way a Sunni prays and the way a Shi'te prays.  My father is a Shi'te and he has taught me to pray with my hands on my sides but I do not know what is the differnce.  Why is there such difference between the two?  Also, I would be very grateful if you tell me which form was used originally by Mohammad.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    1 – The difference between the Shi’ah (Raafidis) and Sunnis 
    (Ahl al-Sunnah) is very great, because of the difference in the sources to 
    which each group refers. The Shi’ah rely on books and scholars who are 
    insignificant in the eyes of the Sunnis. 

    For example, after the Qur’aan, the Sunnis rely on Saheeh 
    al-Bukhaari, but the Shi’ah do not regard it as a reference and they do 
    not regard its author as significant. They even differ from us with regard 
    to the Sahaabah. The Shi’ah regard all the Sahaabah as kaafirs apart from a 
    few of them. Some of them even claim that the Qur’aan which is in 
    circulation among the Sunnis is missing some parts and has been altered; 
    those who do not say that the Qur’aan is missing some parts and has been 
    altered say that it has been misinterpreted and reject the tafseer 
    (interpretation) that has been narrated from our imams. 

    Al-Shu’bi said: I warn you against misguided groups, the 
    worst of which are the Raafidis. ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib burned them with fire 
    and expelled them from the land, and the proof of that is that the ideas of 
    the Raafidis are like the ideas of the Jews. 

    The Jews said that only a man from the family of Dawood could 
    be a leader, and the Raafidis say that only a man from among the descendents 
    of ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib could be a leader. 

    The Jews said that there can be no fighting for the sake of 
    Allaah until the Dajjaal (“Antichrist”) appears and some support comes down 
    from heaven, and the Raafidis say that there can be no fighting for the sake 
    of Allaah until the Mahdi appears and a voice calls out from heaven. 

    The Jews delay the evening prayer until the stars appear, and 
    the Raafidis do likewise. According to a hadeeth narrated from the Prophet 
    SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “My ummah will continue to 
    adhere to the fitrah (sound natural disposition of man) so long as they do 
    not delay Maghrib prayer until the stars appear.” (Abu Dawood, 418; Ibn 
    Maajah, 689; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 
    444). 

    The Jews turned away slightly from their direction of prayer, 
    as do the Raafidis. 

    The Jews sway back and forth in prayer, as do the Raafidis. 

    The Jews regard it as permissible to shed the blood of every 
    Muslim, as do the Raafidis. 

    The Jews do not observe any ‘iddah (waiting period) when a 
    woman is divorced or widowed, and neither do the Raafidis. 

    The Jews reject the idea of three-fold talaaq (divorce), as 
    do the Raafidis. 

    The Jews altered the Tawraat (Torah), as the Raafidis altered 
    the Qur’aan. 

    The Jews hate Jibreel and say, “He is our enemy among the 
    angels.” Some of the Raafidis do likewise and say that he made a mistake by 
    giving the Revelation to Muhammad  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him). 

    Al-Sunnah by al-Khallaal, 
    3/497-498. 

    These are some of the misguidance and myths of the Shi’ah. 
    Hence it is no surprise that they put their arms at their sides when 
    praying, which is clearly contrary to the saheeh Sunnah.

     With regard to the evidence for placing the right hand over 
    the left when praying, there is a great deal of such evidence.  For 
    example: 

    It was narrated that Sahl ibn Sa’d said: The people were 
    commanded to put the right hand over the left forearm when praying. 

    Abu Haazim said: I only know that this is attributed to the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). (Narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari, 707). 

    “[The Prophet]  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) used to place his right hand on his left hand.” (Narrated by Muslim, 
    401). 

    The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) passed by a man who was praying, and who had placed his left 
    hand on his right hand. He grabbed his arms and put his right hand on his 
    left.” (Ahmad, no. 12671) 

    It was narrated from Waa’il ibn Hajar that he saw the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) raise his hands when he 
    started to pray and say Takbeer, and according to Hammaam he raised his 
    hands level with his ears.  Then he wrapped his hands in his garment, 
    putting his right hand on his left. When he wanted to bow in rukoo’ he took 
    his hands from beneath his garment, raised them, then said Takbeer and 
    bowed. When he said “Sami’a Allaah liman hamidah,” he raised his hands, and 
    when he prostrated, he prostrated between his two hands.” (Narrated by 
    Muslim, 401). 

    It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with 
    him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “We Prophets have been commanded to hasten the breaking of 
    our fast and to delay our suhoor, and to put our right hands over our left 
    when praying.” (Narrated by Ibn Hibbaan, 3/13. This hadeeth was classed as 
    saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in Sifat al-Salaah, p. 87). 

    Ibn Hajar said: 

    Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said: There is no different report narrated 
    from the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and this 
    is the view of the majority of the Sahaabah and Taabi’een. This is what was 
    mentioned by Maalik in al-Muwatta’, and Ibn al-Mundhir and others did 
    not narrate anything different from Maalik. Ibn al-Qaasim narrated that 
    Maalik had said that the arms should be held at the sides, and most of his 
    companions followed him. And it was narrated that he said there is a 
    difference between obligatory and naafil prayers. Some of them regarded it 
    as makrooh to hold one hand with the other. Ibn al-Haajib narrated that this 
    means it is makrooh when one does it for the purpose of resting the hands.”
