12403,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12403,Advice to one who wants to get married but is not able for it,"In the mosque we had a program where the Muslim youth could discuss with those who are older the ahaadeeth of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) concerning marriage, and the fact that they should make it easy for the youth to get married. This subject led to a number of discussions, because the parents are concerned about the situation and welfare of the couple, especially if they have children. 

Young people nowadays do not complete their university studies until the age of 21, or 23 for those who study medicine. They cannot afford the expenses of marriage. So what practical advice can you give them? Many of the Muslim youth in the west want to complete half of their religion.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
Discussing Islamic matters and spending time 
    on that is one of the most beneficial things that a person can do for himself, because seeking knowledge is an obligation and an act of worship, 
    and he is spending time in doing something that is of benefit to him and to others. If the people who are discussing do not understand something, 
    then they have to ask people who have knowledge.
 Secondly: 
Our advice to those who live in the lands of 
    immorality and kufr is to migrate from them to the Muslim lands where the temptations of this world and of women are less. The Muslim countries 
    are not equal in that regard, so he has to choose the best of them.  
We advise them to leave every environment in 
    which he may stumble and fall, whether that is his accommodation, his work or his school/college. 
We advise them to hasten to marry, and to 
    choose righteous wives who do not make extravagant demands with regard to the mahr, etc. 
We advise those who are unable to get married 
    to fear Allaah and not to look at or listen to haraam things, not to walk towards haraam things, not to touch that which it is not permissible for 
    him to touch. They should help themselves in this regard by fasting and praying, making du’aa’, and keeping company with righteous people. They 
    should keep themselves busy with beneficial things such as seeking knowledge, memorizing Qur’aan and making du’aa’ to Allaah, for if a person 
    keeps busy in obeying Allaah, that will distract him from disobeying Him. 
Thirdly: 
Our advise to community leaders and parents 
    and guardians of boys and girls is not to regard completion of studies as an impediment to marriage. Since when is marriage an obstacle to 
    acquiring knowledge?! Rather reality and experience point to the opposite, because marriage helps a person to focus and makes his mind clear, and 
    above all that it is obedience to the command of the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to the youth to get married. 
So parents and guardians should not burden 
    the youth with excessive demands that may be regarded as a form of extravagance. They should limit the demands to that which the woman and the 
    house need only. They should understand that marriage is one of the means by which provision is sought. Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 
“And marry those among you who are single (i.e. a man who has no wife and the woman who has no 
    husband) and (also marry) the Saalihoon (pious, fit and capable ones) of your (male) slaves and maid-servants (female slaves). If they be poor, 
    Allaah will enrich them out of His Bounty. And Allaah is All-Sufficient for His creatures’ needs, All-Knowing (about the state of the people)”
[al-Noor 24:32]
And Allaah knows best.",Islam Q&A
12406,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12406,Why should a person who disbelieves after becoming Muslim be executed?,The punishment for the apostate is execution. Why such harshness?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The punishment for apostasy from the religion of Islam is 
    execution. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And whosoever of you turns back from his religion and 
    dies as a disbeliever, then his deeds will be lost in this life and in the 
    Hereafter, and they will be the dwellers of the Fire. They will abide 
    therein forever”

    [al-Baqarah 2:217]
And it was proven that 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever 
    changes his religion, execute him.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh. 
    What this hadeeth means is that whoever leaves Islam and changes to another 
    religion and persists in that and does not repent, is to be executed. It was 
    also proven that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said: “It is not permissible to shed the blood of a person who bears 
    witness that there is no god but Allaah and that I am the Messenger of 
    Allaah except in three cases: a life for a life, a previously-married person 
    who commits adultery, and one who leaves Islam and forsakes the jamaa’ah.” 
    Narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim. 

    This harsh punishment is for a number of reasons: 

    1 – This punishment is a deterrent to anyone who wants to 
    enter Islam just to follow the crowd or for hypocritical purposes. This will 
    motivate him to examine the matter thoroughly and not to proceed unless he 
    understands the consequences of that in this world and in the Hereafter. The 
    one who announces his Islam has agreed to adhere to all the rulings of Islam 
    of his own free will and consent, one of which rulings is that he is to be 
    executed if he apostatizes from the faith. 

    2 – The one who announces his Islam has joined the jamaa’ah 
    (main body) of the Muslims, and whoever joins the main body of the Muslims 
    is required to be completely loyal and to support it and protect it against 
    anything that may lead to fitnah or destroy it or cause division. Apostasy 
    from Islam means forsaking the jamaa’ah and its divine order, and has a 
    harmful effect on it. Execution is the greatest deterrent that will prevent 
    people from committing such a crime.

    3 – Those Muslims who are weak in faith and others who are 
    against Islam may think that the apostate has only left Islam because of 
    what he has found out about its real nature, because if it were the truth 
    then he would never have turned away from it. So they learn from him all the 
    doubts, lies and fabrications which are aimed at extinguishing the light of 
    Islam and putting people off from it. In this case executing the apostate is 
    obligatory, in order to protect the true religion from the defamation of the 
    liars and to protect the faith of its adherents and remove obstacles from 
    the path of those who are entering the faith. 
4 – We also say that the 
    death penalty exists in the modern laws of man to protect the system from 
    disorder in some situation and to protect society against certain crimes 
    which may cause its disintegration, such as drugs etc. If execution can 
    serve as a deterrent to protect man-made systems, then it is more 
    appropriate that the true religion of Allaah, which Falsehood cannot come to 
    it from before it or behind it  [cf. Fussilat 41:42], and which is all 
    goodness, happiness and tranquility in this world and in the Hereafter 
    should punish those who commit acts of aggression against it and seek to 
    extinguish its light and defame its image, and who fabricate lies against it 
    to justify their apostasy and deviation.

It was narrated that `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “Whoever told you that Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw his Lord was lying. He said that no vision can grasp him [Al-An`am 6:103]…” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, Al-Tawhid, 6832)
It was narrated that Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), `Did you see your Lord?’ He said, ‘He is veiled by Light, how could I see Him.’” (Narrated by Muslim, Al-Iman, 261) 
It was narrated that Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “ ‘The (Prophet’s) heart belied not what he saw, and indeed he saw Him at a second descent.’ [An-Najm 53:11-12] (This means that) he saw Him twice with his heart.” (Narrated by Muslim, Al-Iman, 258).   
Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“ `Uthman ibn Sa`id Al-Darimi said in his book Al-Ru’yah that there was consensus among the Companions that he [the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)] did not see his Lord on the night of the Miذraj. Some of them excluded Ibn `Abbas and said that he was not one of those who said that. Our Shaykh says that this does not go against the facts, for Ibn `Abbas did not say that he saw Him with the eyes in his head, and Ahmad relied upon this in one of the two reports narrated from him, where he says that he saw Him but he did not say that that was with the eyes in his head. The wording used by Ahmad is the same as that used by Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both). What indicates that what our Shaykh said about the meaning of the hadeeth of Abu Dharr is correct is the fact that in another hadeeth he said that His veil is Light.  And Allah knows best what the Light is that is mentioned in the hadeeth of Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) where it says, `I saw Light.’” (Ijtima` Al-Juyush Al-Islamiyyah, vol. 1, p. 12)
Shaykh Al-Islam (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Chapter: with regard to seeing Allah, what was proven in an authentic report from Ibn `Abbas is that he said: `Muhammad saw his Lord with his heart twice, and `Aishah denied that he had seen Him. Some people reconciled these two reports by saying that `Aishah denied that he saw Him with his eyes and Ibn `Abbas affirmed that he saw Him with his heart. Some versions of the report narrated from Ibn `Abbas refers to seeing without specifying how, and others indicate that it was with the heart. Sometimes he says that Muhammad saw his Lord, and sometimes he says that Muhammad saw Him. There is no clear statement from Ibn `Abbas which says that he saw Him with his eyes. Similarly Imam Ahmad sometimes says that he saw Him and sometimes says that he saw Him with his heart. No one whom Ahmad heard said that he saw Him with his eyes. But some of his companions heard some of the words that did not specify how, and understood from that that he had seen Him with his eyes, just as some people heard the words of Ibn `Abbas that did not specify how, and understood from that that he had seen Him with his eyes. But there is nothing in the evidence to prove that he saw Him with his eyes, and that was not narrated from any of the Companions. There is nothing in the Quran or Sunnah to indicate that, rather the authentic texts which indicate that he did not see Him are more definitive. In Sahih Muslim it is narrated that Abu Dharr said: `I asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “Did you see your Lord?” He said, “He is veiled with Light, how could I see Him?”’ And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
`Glorified (and Exalted) be He (Allah) [above all that (evil) they associate with Him]
Who took His slave (Muhammad) for a journey by night from Al-Masjid Al-Haram (at Makkah) to Al-Masjid Al-Aqsa (in Jerusalem), the neighbourhood whereof We have blessed, in order that We might show him (Muhammad) of Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, lessons, signs, etc.)’ [Al-Isra’ 17:1]
If he had seen Him with his own eyes, He would have mentioned that. The same applies to the words “Will you then dispute with him (Muhammad) about what he saw [during the Mi’raj]?” [An-Najm 53:12 – interpretation of the meaning]. If he had seen Him with his own eyes, that would have been mentioned. 
It is proven from the authentic texts and from the consensus of the Salaf (first generations) of this Ummah that no one can see Allah with his eyes in this world , with the exception of the claim made by some that our Prophet Muhammad alone saw Him. But they agreed that the believers will see Allah on the Day of Resurrection with their own eyes just as they see the sun and the moon (in this world).”

The difference between prayer and fasting is that prayer is done repeatedly, so if a person does not make up the prayers he missed, he will pray on the following day.

Why is ‘aqiqah important?


How to do ‘aqiqah","Praise be to Allah.Is ‘aqiqah compulsory?
This sacrifice which is done for the newborn is called ‘aqiqah . The scholars differed concerning the ruling on ‘aqiqah; some of them said that it is obligatory and others said that it is Sunnah muakkadah (a confirmed Sunnah). 
The scholars of the Standing Committee said: 
“‘Aqiqah is Sunnah muakkadah. For a boy two sheep should be sacrificed, each of which should meet the same conditions as a sheep for udhiya (sacrifice), and for a girl one sheep should be sacrificed. The sheep should be slaughtered on the seventh day, but if there is a delay it may be slaughtered at any time, and there is no sin in delaying it, although it is preferable to do it as soon as possible. And Allah is the Source of strength; may Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon his family and Companions.” 
There is an odd and weak (da’if) opinion which says that ‘aqiqah is makruh. 
Ibn al-Qayyim said: 
“Imam Ahmad said, according to a report narrated by Hanbal: “It was narrated that some people said that ‘aqiqah is makruh because it is something that belongs to the Jahiliyyah. He said, this is because of their lack of knowledge and the fact that they are not aware of the reports. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did ‘aqiqah for al-Hasan and al-Husayn, and his Companions also did it. These people say that it is something that belongs to the Jahiliyyah, but it is the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who said: ‘Every child is in pledge for his ‘aqiqah’. 
This hadith has a good isnad and was narrated by Abu Hurayrah from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).” 
According to a report narrated by al-Athram, he said: “Concerning the ‘aqiqah , there are ahadith with isnads from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and from his Companions and the Tabi’in, but these people say that it is an act of Jahiliyyah.” And he smiled like one who is surprised.” (Tuhfat al-Mawdud, p. 45-46)
Why is ‘aqiqah important?
With regard to the purpose of the ‘aqiqah , it was mentioned in a hadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him):  “Every child is in pledge for his ‘aqiqah.” 
The scholars differed as to the meaning of this hadith. It was said that the meaning is that if the ‘aqiqah is not done for him and he dies in childhood, he will be prevented from interceding for his parents; or that the ‘aqiqah is a means of ridding the child of the Shaytan and protecting him from him. 
The child may miss out on something good if his parents neglect to do the ‘aqiqah even though that is not his action, just as when the parents have intercourse, if the father says ‘Bismillah” the Shaytan will not harm his child, and if he fails to do so the child will not have this protection. (See Zad al-Ma’ad, 2/325; al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 7/535) 
How to do ‘aqiqah
With regard to how it is to be done, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained that, as may be seen in the following ahadith: 

Salman ibn ‘Amir al-Dabbi said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “ ‘Aqiqah is to be offered for a (newly born) boy, so slaughter (an animal) for him, and remove all dirt from him.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5154) 
‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded them to sacrifice two similar sheep for a boy and one for a girl. (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi; he said, it is hasan sahih; Ibn Majah, 3163; Sahih al-Tirmidhi, 1221)
Umm Karaz narrated that she asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about ‘aqiqah and he said: “For a boy two sheep and for a girl one, and it does not matter whether they are male or female.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1516; he said, it is hasan sahih; al-Nasai, 4217; Abu Dawud, 2835; Ibn Majah, 3162, without the last part; Sahih Abi Dawud, 246) 
Samurah ibn Jundub narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Every child is in pledge for his ‘aqiqah, which should be sacrificed for him on the seventh day and his head should be shaved and he should be given a name.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1522, he said it is hasan sahih; Ibn Majah, 3165; Sahih Ibn Majah, 2563)

Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said: “The Sunnah indicates that it is better for a woman to pray at home , no matter where she is, whether she is in Makkah or elsewhere. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not prevent the female slaves of Allah from coming to the mosques of Allah, but their houses are better for them.” 
He said that when he was in Madinah, even though prayer in the Prophet’s Mosque brings more reward, because a woman’s prayer in her own house is more covering for her and farther removed from temptation (fitnah), so if she is in her house then this is preferable and is better.” (See al-Fatawa al-Jami’ah li’l-Mar-ah al-Muslimah, vol. 1, p. 207) 
The multiplied reward for praying in congregation applies only to men. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to a woman, “I know that you like to pray with me… but your prayer in your house is better for you than your praying in the mosque of your people…” This hadith was narrated by Ahmad (Musnad, Baqi al-Ansar, 25842; classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih al-Targhib wa’l-Tarhib, no. 337)

Al-Nawawi said: “The Sunnah is for a woman who is leading other women in prayer to stand in the middle of the row, because of the reports which state that `Aishah and Umm Salamah led other women and they stood in the midst of them.” (Al-Majmu’ Sharh al-Muhadhdab, vol. 4, p. 192) 
If women pray in congregation , then the one who is leading them should stand in the middle of the row, because that is more concealing, and a woman is required to cover as much as possible. 
It is known that if a woman stands in the midst of other women it is more concealing than if she were to stand in front of them. The evidence for that is the reports which were narrated from `Aishah and Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with them), “When a woman leads other women in prayer, she should stand in the middle of them.” This was the action of the female Companions, and the more correct view is that this action of the female Companions is to be taken as proof because there is no text narrated to the contrary. If a woman is leading one other woman in prayer, she should stand as a man stands with one other man.” (See al-Sharh al-Mumti’ by Ibn ‘Uthaymin, vol. 4, p. 387)

What is meant by a sa` here is the sa` of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), which is four times the amount that may be held in the two hands of a man of average build. If a person does not pay zakat al-fitr, he is sinning, and he has to make it up. 
With regard to the hadith mentioned, we do not know whether it is saheeh or not.

If he asks some of his relatives or friends to carry out the hadd punishment on him, is that correct, and will his sins be forgiven?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The scholars are unanimously agreed that the hadd punishment can only be carried out by the imam (Islamic ruler) or his deputy. This is in the people’s interests and is for the protection of their soul, their wealth and their honour. The imam is able to carry it out because of the power and authority he has, which make the people obey him, and because no one can accuse the imam of being biased or negligent in carrying out the hadd punishments. Thus the imam is able to carry out the hudood punishments in the proper manner so that the shar’i goals will certainly be achieved.  
Al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 17/145.
 It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 7/21: 
The hadd punishments can only be carried out by a Muslim ruler or one who takes the place of the ruler. It is not permissible for individual Muslims to carry out the hadd punishments because of the chaos and fitnah (tribulation) to which that will lead.”  It also says (21/5-6): 
No one can carry out the hadd punishments except the Muslim ruler or his deputy, in order to maintain order and prevent anyone from transgressing against others, and to protect against injustice. And the sinner has to pray for forgiveness and repent to Allaah and do a lot of good deeds. If he is sincere in his repentance towards Allaah, Allaah will accept his repentance and forgive Him by His grace and kindness. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And those who invoke not any other ilaah (god) along with Allaah, nor kill such person as Allaah has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse and whoever does this shall receive the punishment.

“And verily, I am indeed forgiving to him who repents, believes (in My Oneness, and associates none in worship with Me) and does righteous good deeds, and then remains constant in doing them (till his death)” [Ta-Ha 20:82]

12465,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12465,Does she have to obey her husband if he tells her to work outside the home?,"To begin, I state that I embraced Islam about 15 years ago, part of what is so impressive to me is the true revolution to women and their rghts which Islam has made, alhumdo lillah.  But regretfully, so many Muslims do not acknowledge nor apply these standards and I have seen many women taken advantage of due to it.  So my question is rgarding ""Womens Rights""...

men are obligated to  certain maintanance of women, but women are not prohibited from certain things with her husbands permission.  So how can a woman protect herself from being taken advantage of by her husband?

For instance, he wants her to work within his business, still take care of the children an even have more children, bringing the infant to work following the delivery as early as the first week out of the hospital.  She is repsonsible for the grocery shopping, taking the older child to day care, working at his business, preparing meals, and keeping the house neat.  He will assist periodically but not without stating that he has done so as if she should have done it herself.

Can she insist on staying home and being supported?  Or must she obey her husband - since he is not asking her to do something haram?  But she is tired of being tired and unable to convince him her place is in the home, or even be considerate of her needs and he is always unsatisfied by how she isn't performing to his level of satisfaction.

Sorry this is so lengthy, but it is a common problem among many sisters I have seen, taking the rights Allah gave us and not being taken advantage of.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Allaah has made men the protectors and maintainers of women 
    for two reasons, what Allaah has given to men and what men earn. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because 
    Allaah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to 
    support them) from their means”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:34]
The fact that Allaah has 
    given men more than women in terms of reasoning, thinking and physical 
    strength is something concerning which there is no dispute. This is what 
    Allaah has given to men. With regard to what men earn, this refers to the 
    husband’s spending on his wife, which is something that is obligatory and is 
    the basis for the man being the protector and maintainer of the wife. 
It was narrated that 
    Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Fear Allaah with regard to women for 
    Allaah has entrusted them to you and intimacy with them has become 
    permissible for you by the word of Allaah. Their rights over you are that 
    you should provide for them and clothe them on a reasonable basis.” 
Narrated by Muslim, 
    1218. 
Al-Nawawi (may Allaah 
    have mercy on him) said: This indicates that it is obligatory for the 
    husband to spend on his wife and clothe her. This is established by 
    scholarly consensus. Sharh Muslim, 8/184. 
One of the reasons why it 
    is obligatory for the husband to spend on the wife is that the wife is 
    prevented from earning an income because of her duties towards her husband, 
    children and house. 
Al-Bukhaari (may Allaah 
    have mercy on him) said: “The obligation of spending on one's wife and 
    children.” 
Then he narrated the 
    hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah, according to which the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The best of charity is that which 
    leaves one independent of means, and the upper hand is better than the lower 
    hand, and start with those who are dependent upon you.” 
Al-Bukhaari, 1426; 
    Muslim, 1034. 
Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar 
    said: 
The reason why it is 
    obligatory to spend on the wife is that she is prevented from earning 
    because of her duties to fulfil the husband’s rights. There is scholarly 
    consensus that this is obligatory.  
Al-Fath, 
    9/625. 
The husband has to fear 
    Allaah his Lord, and take care of the wife and children that Allaah has 
    entrusted to him. It is not permissible for him to force his wife to do that 
    which she is unable to do. She does not have to work and spend on the house 
    and on him; rather it is obligatory for him to spend on her even if she is 
    rich. 
The role that the woman 
    plays in the home is very important, because she looks after the house and 
    takes care of it, and she fulfils her husband’s rights by preparing the 
    house for him, keeping it clean and tidy, making food, looking after the 
    children, and many other things. 
The woman does not have 
    to work outside the house, especially if going out will expose her to mixing 
    with non-mahram men and failing or falling short in her duties towards her 
    house and children. 
As mentioned above, it is 
    obligatory for the husband to spend on her, according to scholarly 
    consensus. He has to realize this and make his wife feel safe and protected 
    in her house so that she can do that which Allaah has enjoined upon her.

If the wife, like the husband, was not praying at the time of the

12468,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12468,The Muslim in Ramadan,What should we say to the Muslims on the occasion of the beginning of Ramadan?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Quran, a guidance for mankind and clear proofs for the guidance and the criterion (between right and wrong). So whoever of you sights (the crescent on the first night of) the month (of Ramadan i.e. is present at his home), he must observe Sawm (fasts) that month, and whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number [of days which one did not observe Sawm (fasts) must be made up] from other days. Allah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you. (He wants that you) must complete the same number (of days), and that you must magnify Allah [i.e. to say Takbeer (Allahu Akbar: Allah is the Most Great)] for having guided you so that you may be grateful to Him.”
[al-Baqarah 2:185] 
This blessed month is a great opportunity for goodness, barakah (blessing), worship and obedience towards Allah. 
It is a great month, a noble season, a month in which hasanaat (rewards for good deeds) are multiplied and in which committing sayi’aat (bad deeds) is more serious than at other times. The gates of Paradise are opened and the gates of Hell are shut, and the sinners’ repentance to Allah is accepted.  
So give thanks to Him for the season of goodness and blessing that He has bestowed upon you, and for the means of bounty and various kinds of great blessings for which He has singled you out.  Make the most of this blessed time by filling it with acts of worship and forsaking haraam things, so that you may attain a good life in this world and happiness after death. 
For the sincere believer, every month is an occasion for worship and his whole life is spent in obeying Allah, but in the month of Ramadan he has even more motives to do good and his heart is even more focused on worship, and he turns even more to his Lord. By His grace, our generous Lord bestows His bounty upon the fasting believers and multiplies the reward for them on this blessed occasion, so He gives abundantly and rewards generously for righteous deeds.  
Time passes quickly 
Days pass so quickly, as if they were mere moments. We welcomed Ramadan, then we bade it farewell, and only a short period of time passed and we are welcoming Ramadan again. So we should hasten to do good deeds in this month and strive to fill it with that which Allah is pleased with and with that which will help us on the Day when we meet Him. 
How can we prepare for Ramadan? 
We can prepare for Ramadan by taking stock of ourselves and recognizing our shortcomings in living up to the Shahaadatayn, or our shortcoming in fulfilling our duties, or our shortcomings in not keeping away from the desires and doubts that we may have fallen into… 
We should set ourselves straight so that in Ramadan we will have a higher degree of faith. For faith increases and decreases. It increases through obedience to Allah and it decreases through disobedience and sin. The first act of obedience that a person should achieve is that of being a true slave of Allah and believing that there is none that is rightfully worshipped except Allah, so he directs all kinds of worship to Allah and does not associate anyone else in worship with Him. Each of us should realize that whatever has befallen him could not have missed him, and whatever missed him could not have befallen him, and that everything happens by the will and decree of Allah. 
We should avoid everything that could undermine our commitment to the Shahaadatayn. This means keeping away from bid’ah (innovations) and things that have been introduced into the religion. We should also follow the principle of al-walaa’ wa’l-bara’ (loyalty and friendship vs. disavowal and enmity), by taking the believers as our friends and by regarding the kaafirs and hypocrites as enemies, and we should rejoice when the Muslims gain a victory over their enemies. We should follow the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his companions and adhere to the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the way of the Rightly-Guided Khulafa’ who came after him. We should love the Sunnah and love those who adhere to it and defend it, in whatever country they are and whatever colour or nationality they are. 
After that we should take stock of ourselves and recognize our shortcomings in doing acts of worship such as praying in congregation, remembering Allah (dhikr), paying attention to the rights of neighbours, relatives and the Muslims, spreading the greeting of salam, enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, urging one another to follow the truth and be patient and steadfast in doing so, being patient in avoiding evil actions and in doing good deeds, and accepting the decree of Allah with patience. 
Then we should take stock of ourselves and our sins and our following whims and desires. We should stop ourselves from persisting in that, whether the sin is great or small, whether it is a sin of the eye, by looking at that which Allah has forbidden; or by listening to music; or by walking to things of which Allah does not approve; or by using one's hands to srike in a manner with which Allah is not pleased; or by consuming things that Allah has forbidden such as riba (usury) and bribes, or any other means of consuming people’s wealth unlawfully.
 We should never forget that Allah stretches forth His hand during the day to accept the repentance of those who sinned at night, and He stretches forth His hand at night to accept the repentance of those who sinned during the day. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And march forth in the way (which leads to) forgiveness from your Lord, and for Paradise as wide as the heavens and the earth, prepared for Al-Muttaqoon (the pious).
Those who spend (in Allah’s Cause) in prosperity and in adversity, who repress anger, and who pardon men; verily, Allah loves Al-Muhsinoon (the good‑doers).
And those who, when they have committed Faahishah (illegal sexual intercourse) or wronged themselves with evil, remember Allah and ask forgiveness for their sins; — and none can forgive sins but Allah — and do not persist in what (wrong) they have done, while they know.
For such, the reward is forgiveness from their Lord, and Gardens with rivers flowing underneath (Paradise), wherein they shall abide forever. How excellent is this reward for the doers (who do righteous deeds according to Allah’s Orders)”
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:133-136] 
“Say: “O ‘Ibaadi (My slaves) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allah, verily, Allah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful”
[al-Zumar 39:53] 
“And whoever does evil or wrongs himself but afterwards seeks Allah’s forgiveness, he will find Allah Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful”
[al-Nisa’ 4:110] 
By taking stock, repenting and seeking forgiveness, this is how we should welcome Ramadan. “The smart man is the one who takes stock of himself and strives to do that which will benefit him after death, and the helpless one is the one who follows his own whims and desires and engages in wishful thinking, (assuming that Allah will forgive him regardless of what he does and that he does not need to strive to good deeds).” 
The month of Ramadan is the month of great gains and profits. The smart trader is the one who makes the most of special occasions to increase his profits. So make the most of this month by doing lots of acts of worship, praying a great deal, reading Quran, forgiving people, being kind to others and giving charity to the poor.
 In the month of Ramadan the gates of Paradise are opened and the gates of Hell are shut. The devils are put in chains and a caller cries out each night, O seeker of good, proceed, O seeker of evil, desist. 
So, O slaves of Allah, be among the people of good, following the path of your righteous forebears who were guided by the Sunnah of your Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), so that we may end Ramadan with our sins forgiven and our righteous deeds accepted. 
We should note that the month of Ramadan is the best of months.
Ibn al-Qayyim said: 
Another of example of that – i.e., of the differentiation between the things that Allah has created – is the fact that the month of Ramadan is superior to all other months, and the last ten nights are superior to the other nights.” 
Zaad al-Ma’aad, 1/56 
This month is superior to others in four things: 
1 – In it there is the best night of the year, which is Laylat al-Qadr. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, We have sent it (this Quran) down in the Night of Al‑Qadr (Decree).
And what will make you know what the Night of Al‑Qadr (Decree) is?
The Night of Al‑Qadr (Decree) is better than a thousand months (i.e. worshipping Allah in that night is better than worshipping Him a thousand months, i.e. 83 years and 4 months).
Therein descend the angels and the Rooh [Jibreel (Gabriel)] by Allah’s Permission with all Decrees,
(All that night), there is peace (and goodness from Allah to His believing slaves) until the appearance of dawn”
[al-Qadar 97:1-5] 
So worship on this night is better than worshipping for a thousand months. 
2 – In this month was revealed the best of Books to the best of the Prophets (peace be upon them). Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Quran, a guidance for mankind and clear proofs for the guidance and the criterion (between right and wrong)”
[al-Baqarah 2:185] 
“We sent it (this Quran) down on a blessed night [(i.e. the Night of Al‑Qadr) in the month of Ramadan — the 9th month of the Islamic calendar]. Verily, We are ever warning [mankind that Our Torment will reach those who disbelieve in Our Oneness of Lordship and in Our Oneness of worship].
Therein (that night) is decreed every matter of ordainments.
As a Command (or this Quran or the Decree of every matter) from Us. Verily, We are ever sending (the Messengers)”
[al-Dukhaan 44:3-5] 
It was narrated by Ahmad and by al-Tabaraani in al-Mu’jam al-Kabeer that Waathilah ibn al-Asqa’ (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The Scriptures of Ibraaheem were sent down on the first of the month of Ramadan. The Tawraat was sent down on the sixth of Ramadan. The Injeel was sent down on the thirteenth of Ramadan. The Zaboor was sent down on the eighteenth of Ramadan, and the Quran was sent down on the twenty-fourth of Ramadan. 
Classed as hasan by al-Albani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 1575. 
3 – In this month the gates of Paradise are opened and the gates of Hell are shut, and the devils are chained up. 
It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When Ramadan comes, the gates of Paradise are opened and the gates of Hell are closed, and the devils are put in chains.” (Agreed upon). 
Al-Nasaa’i narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When Ramadan comes, the gates of mercy are opened and the gates of Hell are shut, and the devils are put in chains.” 
Classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 471.  
Al-Tirmidhi, Ibn Maajah and Ibn Khuzaymah narrated in one report: “When the first night of the month of Ramadan comes, the devils and rebellious jinn are chained up and the gates of Hell are closed, and not one gate of it is opened. The gates of Paradise are opened and not one gate of it is closed. And a caller cries out: ‘O seeker of good, proceed; O seeker of evil, desist. And Allah has those whom He redeems from the Fire, and that happens every night.” 
Classed as hasan by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 759. 
If it is asked, how come we see many evil actions and sins committed in Ramadan, for if the devils are chained up that would not happen? 
The answer is that evil actions become less for those who observe the conditions and etiquette of fasting;
or that the ones who are chained up are some of the devils – namely the rebellious ones – not all of them;
or that what is meant is that evil is reduced in Ramadan, which is a proven fact. If evil happens at this time, it is still less than at other times. Even if all of them (the devils) are chained up, that does not necessarily mean that no evil or sin will happen, because there are other causes of that besides the devils, such as evil souls, bad habits and the devils among mankind. Al-Fath, 4/145 
4 – There are many kinds of worship in Ramadan, some of which are not done at other times, such as fasting, praying qiyaam, feeding the poor, i’tikaaf, sadaqah, and reading Quran.

For more, please see the detailed answer.",,"Praise be to Allah.The Sunnah is to hasten to break the fast , which means breaking fast straight after the sun has set. Delaying breaking the fast until after the stars have come out is the practice of the Jews, and the Rafidis (Shi’ah) followed them in that.
So it is not correct to delay breaking the fast deliberately until later in the evening or to delay it until the end of the adhan. All of that is contrary to the teachings of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
Sahl ibn Sa’d narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The people will continue to be fine so long as they hasten to break their fast.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1856; Muslim, 1098)
Al-Nawawi said: 
“This hadith means that we are encouraged to hasten to break the fast after ascertaining that the sun has indeed set. What this means is that the ummah’s affairs will continue to be in order and they will be fine so long as they adhere to this Sunnah. But if they delay breaking the fast, that will be an indication of some misguidance that they are following.” (Sharh Muslim, 7/208)
Abu Awfa (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I was with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) on a journey, and he fasted until the afternoon. Then he said to a man, “Go and prepare a specific kind of food for me.” The man said, “Why not wait until it is evening?” He said, “Go and prepare (that food) for me, and when you see that night has come from this direction, then the fasting person should break his fast.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1857; Muslim, 1101) 
Abu ‘Atiyyah said: Masruq and I entered upon ‘Aishah and said: O Mother of the Believers, there are two men among the Companions of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), one of whom hastens to break his fast and pray, and the other delays breaking the fast and prayer. She said: Who is it that hastens to break the fast and to pray? We said, ‘Abd-Allah (meaning Ibn Mas’ud). She said: That is what the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to do. (Narrated by Muslim, 1099)
Al-Hafiz ibn Hajar said: 
“One of the reprehensible innovations that have appeared in our times is giving the second adhan approximately twenty minutes before Fajr in Ramadan , and extinguishing the lamps which indicate that it is haram to eat and drink for those who want to fast. Those who do this claim that they are erring on the side of caution with regard to an act of worship, but no one knows of this practice except a few. As a result of that, they have started not to give the adhan until a while after sunset, so as to be certain of the time, as they claim. So they delay breaking the fast and they hasten to eat suhur, thus going against the Sunnah. Hence they do little good and do a great deal of evil. And Allah is the One Whose help we seek.” (Fath al-Bari, 4/199)

12475,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12475,Rulings to do with abortion,I would like to know the rulings that have to do with abortion of the foetus at various stages.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 
We have already stated in 
    the answer to question no.
    42321 the ruling on 
    abortion. Please refer to this information. 

    Secondly: 

    With regard to the rulings following an abortion, they vary 
    according to the time of the abortion, and fall into four categories, as 
    follows: 

    1 – If the pregnancy is aborted within the first two stages 
    (the nutfah (drop) stage which results from the mixing of the “two waters” 
    which is the first forty days after the embryo attaches itself in the womb, 
    and the ‘alaqah (clot) stage where it turns into solid blood during the 
    second forty days), which add up to a total of eighty days, then in this 
    case if it is aborted as a nutfah or ‘alaqah, there are no rulings to be 
    followed, and there is no scholarly dispute on this point. The woman should 
    continue to fast and pray as if she had not had an abortion, but she has to 
    do wudoo’ for each prayer if she has any bleeding, as in the case of a woman 
    suffering from istihaadah (non-menstrual vaginal bleeding). 

    2 – If the pregnancy is aborted in the third stage, the 
    mudghah (chewed piece of flesh) stage, when the embryo looks like a piece of 
    meat with the limbs and features beginning to appear, which lasts for forty 
    days from the eighty-first to the one hundred and twentieth day, then there 
    are two scenarios:  

    (i)This embryo does not have any 
    human features and the midwives or other attendants did not testify that 
    this was the beginning of a human being. In this case the ruling on abortion 
    of this mudghah is the same as the ruling on abortion in the first two 
    stages, and there are no rulings to be followed.

    (ii)The embryo has complete human 
    features or some human features  such as a hand or foot, etc, or there are 
    features but they are indistinct, or the midwives or other attendants 
    testified that this was the beginning of a human being. In this case the 
    rulings on nifaas are to be followed, and this signals the end of ‘iddah 
    (waiting period following divorce or death of the husband, if applicable).

    3 – If the pregnancy is aborted in the fourth stage, i.e., 
    after the soul has been breathed into the foetus, which is after the 
    beginning of the fifth month or after one hundred and twenty days of 
    pregnancy have passed. Here there are two scenarios: 

    (i)If the foetus did not cry after 
    birth, then the rulings mentioned with regard to the second stage of the 
    mudghah are to be followed, but in addition the foetus should be washed, 
    shrouded and the funeral prayer offered for him; he should be given a name 
    and the ‘aqeeqah offered for him.

    (ii)If the foetus cried after 
    birth, then the rulings concerning a full-term baby apply, as mentioned

    must unite in following the Qur’aan and Sunnah and the understanding of the salaf (early generations) of this ummah, so that they can refer to 
    infallible sources to judge between them in cases of dispute. The Muslims should support one another, so that a Muslim helps his brother and the 
    one who is obedient to Allaah gives advice to one who is falling short. The Muslim must know who are the enemies of Islam so that he can disavow 
    himself of them clearly. 
The Muslims should form a sharee’ah council 
    to which they can refer to resolve disputes and seek their rights as granted by sharee’ah, and to supervise the Muslims in their education and 
    activities, and to check that their food and drink is halaal and that their dead are washed and buried in accordance with sharee’ah, and other 
    things that they need. 
A strong community should have certain basic 
    attributes, and we have mentioned the most important of them. 
We ask Allaah to guide the Muslims everywhere 
    and enable them to form a single, united ummah.
We do not know exactly what the situation is

12478,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12478,The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw Paradise,I want to know if Prophet mohammed has seen the heaven?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Many texts indicate that Paradise and Hell are two creations which currently exist, and that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw Paradise and Hell. This is proven by many events, for example: 
The hadeeth of ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Abbaas, who said: “There was an eclipse of the sun during the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed… Then he said, ‘The sun and the moon are two of the signs of Allah. They do not become eclipsed because of the death of somebody or because of his life (i.e. birth). So when you see them, remember Allah.’ The people said, O Messenger of Allah, we saw you taking something from where you were standing, and then we saw you retreating.’ The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) replied, ‘I saw Paradise and stretched my hands towards a bunch (of its fruits) and had I taken it, you would have eaten from it as long as the world remains. I also saw the Hell-fire and I had never seen such a horrible sight. I saw that most of its inhabitants were women.’ The people asked, ‘O Messenger of Allah, why is that?’ The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) replied, ‘Because of their ungratefulness.’ It was asked, ‘Are they ungrateful to Allah?’ The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ‘They are ungrateful to their life companions (husbands) and ungrateful for good deeds. If you are kind towards one of them throughout life, then she sees anything (undesirable) in you, she will say, “I have never seen anything good from you.”’”
(This version narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1052; also narrated by Muslim, 901) 
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw Paradise in his dreams, and the dreams of the Prophets are a form of wahy (revelation) and are true; he saw al-Rumaysa’ in Paradise; he saw a palace belonging to ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab in Paradise; and he saw Paradise on the night of the Mi’raaj when the Sidrah (lote-tree of the utmost boundary) was covered with what it was covered with.

12481,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12481,The meaning of the hadith “It is not an act of righteousness to fast when travelling”,"I know that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “It is not an act of righteousness to fast when travelling.” Does this mean that it is not right for a traveller to fast?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly, we have already stated in the answer to question no. 20165 that fasting whilst travelling may fall into three categories: 
1 – If fasting does not cause hardship, then it is preferable to fast. 
2 – If fasting causes hardship, then it is better to break one's fast. 
3 – If a person will be harmed by fasting or there is the fear that he may die, then fasting becomes haraam and he has to break his fast. 
We have also quoted evidence from the Sunnah concerning that.  
Secondly: This hadith to which the questioner refers applies in the third case. If we know the context of the hadith and the reason why it was narrated, that will become clear. 
Al-Bukhaari (1946) and Muslim (1115) narrated from Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was on a journey, and he saw a crowd of people and a man who was being shaded. He said, “What is this?” They said, “He is fasting.” He said, “It is not an act of righteousness to fast whilst travelling.” 
Al-Sindi said: 
The words “It is not an act of righteousness …” mean it is not an act of obedience or worship. 
Al-Nawawi said: 
What it means is that if it is too difficult for you to fast and you fear that it may harm you. The context of the hadith indicates that this is how it should be interpreted… The hadith has to do with one who may be harmed by fasting. 
This is the way in which al-Bukhari understood the hadith. He introduced it by saying: 
“Chapter: The words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to one who was being shaded when the heat was too intense, ‘It is not an act of righteousness to fast when travelling.’” 
Al-Haafiz said: 
By this introduction he indicated that the reason why the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said “It is not an act of righteousness to fast when travelling” is the hardship that was mentioned. 
Ibn al-Qayyim said in Tahdheeb al-Sunan: 
With regard to the words “It is not an act of righteousness to fast when travelling”, this was said concerning a specific person whom the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw being shaded and fasting had exhausted him. So he said these words, i.e., it is not an act of righteousness for a person to exhaust himself to this extent when Allah has allowed him not to fast.  
Thirdly: 
This hadith cannot be interpreted in general terms to mean that it is not an act of righteousness to fast on any type of journey, because it is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to fast when travelling.  
Hence al-Khattaabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
These words were spoken for a reason, so they are limited to those who are in a similar situation. It is as if he said that it is not an act of righteousness for a traveller to fast if fasting will lead to him suffering in such a manner. And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) fasted on his journey in the year of the Conquest.

    that which was narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh from Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: “We were with the Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) on a journey. Some of us were fasting and some were not. We stopped to rest on a hot day. Those of us who had 
    the most shade were those who had cloaks, and some of us shielded ourselves from the sun with our hands. Those who were fasting could not move and 
    those who were not fasting got up and set up tents and gave water to the riding animals. The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Those who are not fasting have gotten the reward today.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3/224; Muslim, 1119). According to 
    another version narrated by Muslim, he said: “The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was on a journey and some 
    people were fasting and some were not. Those who were not fasting worked hard, but those who were fasting were too weak to do some kinds of work. 
    He said concerning that, ‘Those who are not fasting have gotten the reward today.’” 
The meaning of the two hadeeths is clear, 
    which is that availing oneself of the concession allowing a person not to fast whilst travelling when it is difficult and is very hot is better 
    than taking the more ambitious option which is fasting.

12488,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12488,Can You Break Your Fast If You Feel Sick?,What is the sickness which permits a fasting person to break his fast in Ramadan? Is it permissible to break the fast for any sickness even if it is minor?,"Most of the scholars are of the view that the sick person is not allowed to break his fast in Ramadan unless the sickness is severe. For more, please see the detailed answer.",,"Praise be to Allah.Most of the scholars – including the four imams – are of the view that the sick person is not allowed to break his fast in Ramadan unless the sickness is severe. 
What is meant by severe sickness is: 

The sickness will be made worse by fasting
Recovery will be delayed by fasting
Fasting will cause intense hardship, even if it does not make the sickness worse or delay recovery
The scholars also included those who fear that they may become sick because of fasting.

Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (4/403): 
“The kind of sickness in which it is permitted to break the fast is intense sickness which will be made worse by fasting or it is feared that recovery will be delayed. It was said to Ahmad: When can the sick person break his fast? He said, When he is unable to fast. It was said, Such as a fever? He said, What sickness is worse than fever? 
The healthy person who fears that he may become sick if he fasts is like the sick person who fears that his sickness may get worse, they are both permitted to break their fasts, because the sick person is permitted to break his fast because of the fear that his fasting may make his sickness worse and last for longer, and the fear that fasting may cause sickness is similar to that.” (Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmu’, 6/261)
The person who is unable to fast because of a sickness which he hopes will go away is not obliged to fast. This applies if he encounters obvious difficulty in fasting and is not subject to the condition that he reaches a point when he is unable to fast. Rather our companions said: The permission not to fast is subject to the condition that fasting causes him difficulties that it is hard for him to bear.”  
Some of the scholars were of the view that it is permissible for every sick person to break his fast and that it is not essential that fasting cause them hardship.  
This is an odd view which was rejected by the scholars. 
Al-Nawawi said: 
“With regard to the person who is slightly sick and who does not suffer any obvious hardship, it is not permissible for him to break his fast, and there is no difference of opinion among us concerning that.” (Al-Majmu’, 6/261)
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said: 
“The sick person who is not affected by fasting, such as one who has a slight cold or headache, or a slight toothache and the like, is not permitted to break his fast. Even though some of the scholars allow that because of the verse (interpretation of the meaning):  
“…and whoever is ill …” [al-Baqarah 2:185],
we say that the ruling mentioned in this verse is connected to a condition, which is when breaking the fast will relieve him of hardship, but if fasting does not affect him, then it is not permissible for him to break the fast, and he has to fast.” (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 6/352)
