45001,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45001,"Every time he improves in worship, he goes back to sin","I have a problem. Every time I do more acts of worship and my faith improves and I do more naafil acts of worship, Sunnahs and things that are mustahabb, I end up committing the secret habit (masturbation) despite the fact that I am married and have a happy family life. When I do this thing I feel that I am committing sin and I feel ashamed before Allaah. So I strive to increase my faith but it is not long before I do the same thing again. I am in a bad situation – please help me.
I heard on a tape that some people are filled with self-admiration when they increase their acts of worship, so Allaah causes them to commit sin so that they will realize that they are still slaves who have no right to admire their deeds, and whatever they do is still only a little. Am I one of these people? Is what I understood from that tape correct? 
Please note that, praise be to Allaah, I pray and adhere to most of the teachings of Islam, but this problem gets worse every time I do more naafil acts of worship. What is the solution? Please help me, may Allaah reward you with good.",,,"Praise be to Allah.What you have mentioned – that Allaah may test a person with sin in order to bring him back to Him, and so that he will not admire himself – has been mentioned by some of the scholars. Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
“Sin may be more beneficial for a person, if it leads him to repent, than doing a lot of acts of worship. This is what is meant by the words of one of the salaf: ‘A person may commit a sin and enter Paradise because of it, or he may do an act of worship and enter Hell because of it.’ They said: ‘How is that?’ He said: ‘He may commit a sin and continues to think about it, and when he stands or sits or walks he remembers his sin, so he feels ashamed and repents and seeks forgiveness and regrets it, so that will be the means of his salvation. And he may do a good deed and continue to think about it, and when he stands or sits or walks he remembers it and it fills him with self-admiration and pride, so it is the cause of his doom. So the sin may be the factor that leads him to do acts of worship and good deeds and to change his attitude so that he fears Allaah and feels shy before Him and feels humiliated before Him, hanging his head in shame and weeping with regret, seeking he forgiveness of his Lord. Each of these effects is better for a person than an act of worship that makes him feel proud and show off and look down on people. Undoubtedly this sin is better before Allaah and is more likely to bring salvation than one who admires himself and looks down on others, and who thinks that he is doing Allaah a favour.  Even if he says words that indicate something other than that, Allaah is the Witness over what is in his heart. Such a person may feel hatred towards people if they do not hold him in high esteem and humiliate themselves before him. If he were to examine himself honestly, he would see that clearly.” Madaarij al-Saalikeen, 1/299 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said:  
“How often is it the case that one of us will be better after committing sin than he was before. In many instances a person errs and falls into sin, then he feels ashamed in his heart before Allaah and he turns to Him and repents to Him, so that he thinks of that sin all the time and continually regrets it and seeks forgiveness. But another person may think that he is obedient (towards Allaah) and that he is one of the people who obey and worship Him, so he starts to admire himself and does not turn to Allaah, which adversely affects his religious commitment. Allaah is Wise and may test a person with sin in order to set him straight, just as He may test a person with hunger in order to improve his health. Adam was only chosen after he had committed sin and repented therefrom. 
As Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Then his Lord chose him, and turned to him with forgiveness, and gave him guidance” [Ta-Ha 20:122] i.e., after he had sinned and repented, his Lord chose him and accepted his repentance and guided him. Looks at those who stayed behind from the campaign of Tabook – what happened to them? Undoubtedly their faith increased and they attained a higher status than they had before. Could the verses concerning them that will be recited until the Day of Resurrection have been revealed if they had not done that then repented to Allaah?” 
al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 3/66 
Moreover it should be noted that this habit is haraam according to sharee’ah, as is indicated by the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). We have already quoted the evidence in detail in the answer to question no. 329.  This habit is also something that is regarded as repulsive according to man’s instincts and reason, and it is not befitting for a Muslim to lower himself to the level of doing that. 
It should also be noted that sin has a negative effect on a person in this world and in the Hereafter, if he does not repent and if Allaah does not bestow His mercy upon him. We have already discussed this in detail in the following questions:  23425 and 8861. 
There are causes for this habit, so keep away from them so that you will be able to give it up. You should do the following things: 
1-Strive to keep company with good, righteous, pious people, and learn from them and their experiences.
2-Always remember Allaah and recite Qur’aan, and adopt a daily wird (collection of du’aa’s and dhikrs) that you recite every day without fail.
3-Set yourself a program for learning Islamic knowledge etc.
4-Set yourself an exercise program, or join a sports club
5-Do a lot of naafil acts of worship, especially voluntary fasts, for this is an important means of resisting temptation and reducing desire.
6-Strive in making du’aa’ and ask Allaah to rid you of this forbidden bad habit and to strengthen your resolve.
7-Remember that the harms caused by the secret habit are innumerable; it weakens the body, saps one’s strength, and increases the distance between a person and his Lord. It is a major factor in depression and feelings of sin.
8-Avoid being alone as much as possible, because this habit is one of the effects of being alone.
9-Try to pray in the mosque, and pray qiyaam al-layl, because this will bring tranquility to the heart.
10-Finally, you have to repent continually, weep with fear of Allaah, humble yourself before Him, and ask Him to forgive you. If you resolve firmly each time not to go back to that habit, then your nafs threatens to overwhelm you, then resist it.  “But as for him who feared standing before his Lord, and restrained himself from impure evil desires and lusts, Verily, Paradise will be his abode” [al-Naazi’aat 79:40 – interpretation of the meaning]. If you give in, then repent anew, and renew your promise (not to do it again). Do not despair of the mercy of Allaah, and do a great deal of naafil acts of worship and righteous deeds. “And perform As-Salaat (Iqaamat-as- Salaat), at the two ends of the day and in some hours of the night [i.e. the five compulsory Salaat (prayers)]. Verily, the good deeds remove the evil deeds (i.e. small sins). That is a reminder (an advice) for the mindful (those who accept advice)” [Hood 11:114].

45016,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45016,"He stole from his father and brother, and now regrets it","When I was a teenager, I used to take money from my father and my older brother without their knowledge. Now I regret what I did, and I am wondering whether I should return the money to its owners, but I do not know exactly how much I took.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    What you did comes under the heading of stealing, but you 
    regret what you have done and the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “Regret is repentance.” Narrated by Ahmad, 3558; 
    Ibn Maajah (4252; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah. 
    What is meant is that regret is the major part of repentance. 
that you have been guided to repent. Part 
    of your repentance is returning things to their rightful owners, or asking 
    them to forgive you and let you off. 
    
    You have to figure out how much you took, and do your best to 
    work it out, then return it to your father and brother. 

    You do not have to tell them that you had stolen this money 
    from them, rather the point is to return the money to its rightful owners in 
    whatever way possible.

    If you want to tell them what happened and ask for their 
    forgiveness, this will not harm you, in sha Allaah, especially since you did 
    this when you were a teenager and Allaah has now enabled you to repent from 
    it. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The 
    one who repents is like one who did not sin.” Narrated by Ibn Maajah, 4250; 
    classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah. 
You must hasten to do 
    that, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said to his companions one day: 

    “Do you know who is the one who is bankrupt?” They said: 
    “Among us, the one who is bankrupt is the one who has no dirhams and no 
    goods.” He said: “Rather the one who is bankrupt amongst my ummah is the one 
    who will come on the Day of Resurrection with prayer, fasting and zakaah, 
    but he will come having insulted this one, slandered that one, consumed the 
    wealth of this one, shed the blood of that one and beaten this one, all of 
    whom will be given some of his hasanaat (good deeds), and if his hasanaat 
    run out before the scores have been settled, some of their sins will be 
    taken and thrown onto him, then he will be cast into the Fire.” Narrated by 
    Muslim, 2581. 

    We ask Allaah to accept your repentance, and to help you to say and do the right thing.

45018,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45018,Should he accept his father’s money that was earned from haram sources?,"I hope you can advise me about this matter. I am a young man, twenty-one years old. I am studying in business college and my father works in tourism (in the private sector, in one of the resort cities). He is an electrical engineer and works in the village as the director of the engineering department, which means that he is responsible for everything that has to do with electricity, staring with light fixtures and ending with water pumps, and including refrigerators for storing wine, lights for dance halls, televisions, etc. He receives a high salary for this work, four thousand Egyptian pounds. 
As well as studying, I was also working in a restaurant – just because I liked the work, not because I needed to. When I wanted to become independent and start a small business of my own, I could not find anyone except my father from whom to take the money I needed. But I was not sure as to whether my father’s money is halal or haram, so I consulted one of the shaykhs who are known to be of Ahl al-Sunnah, and he told me that as his money is mixed, it is not permissible for me to take anything of it except for essential things such as food, drink, clothing and tuition fees. As for what I need as capital to start my own business, it is permissible to take it from him as a loan. But now my father wants to help me as a father, and work alongside me in the store. Sometimes I would leave the store to him and go and take care of the store’s needs and my own needs. In this way my father started to learn about my work and was able to run the store by himself. This is where the first problem arises … I used to keep precise records of what I took from my father, but since he joined me in the store, things have become mixed up. My father sometimes takes money from his own pocket and puts it in the till, or buys goods for the store from his own pocket. This can be kept track of with a great deal of effort, but what I cannot keep track of is the fact that he may buy food for the house, then he finds that the store needs it, so he brings some of what he bought for the house and puts it in the store, without my knowledge and without consulting me, and without telling me how much it cost so I can repay him. 
The second problem is that he is not happy with the idea of my returning the money to him, he regards it as my money and my brothers’ money, and he is working and bringing this money for us, so he will never accept the money being returned to him. 
The third problem is that he is not convinced that his money is haram – if it is haram. He thinks that it is the kind of “necessity which means that forbidden things are permitted” and his government job pays only 400 Egyptian pounds – not the difference. We are a family of five, two of whom are studying in university. He thinks that the wealth of the state is all haram because the state deals with riba-based loans and imposes taxes and allows trade in alcohol, so everyone who works has some haram element in his income.  My question now is: 
1- What is the ruling on my father’s wealth? Does the principle of “necessity which means that forbidden things are permitted” apply here? If that is the case, is it permissible for us to make use of his haram earnings because he is looking after us?
2- How can I work out how much money my father has contributed to my business, when he himself does not know how much it is?
3- How can I return this money to him – if I have to return it – if he refuses to take it? Is it permissible for me to insist and to pay back the debts I owe to the people to whom it is owed?
4- What is permissible to me of my father’s wealth? If he dies, is it permissible for me to inherit his wealth?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Undoubtedly working in the tourist industry as it exists at present, especially in your country, involves a lot of things that go against sharee’ah, such as mixing, tabarruj (wanton display of women), alcohol and other haram things. As this is the case, part of your father’s wealth is haram. This is what the scholars call mixed wealth. 
The scholars have stated that if a person has mixed wealth that includes both halal and haram, it is permissible to eat from his wealth and it is permissible to deal with him in all ways, but it is better to be cautious. 
With regard to your father claiming that this is a necessity, that is not correct, because there are many means of earning a halal living. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And whosoever fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty).
3. And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine”
[al-Talaaq 65:2-3]
If a person makes this claim, then soon he will claim that he can do all kinds of haram things because of necessity. 
You should understand that there are severe consequences to consuming haram wealth, even if that is only that one’s du`as are not answered, as it says in Saheeh Muslim, that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah is Good and only accepts that which is good…” and he mentioned a man who has been traveling for a long time and is unkempt and covered with dust, and he raises his hands to the heavens (and says), “O Lord, O Lord,” when his food is haram, his drink is haram, his clothes are haram, and he is nourished with haram, so how can he receive any response? Narrated by Muslim, no. 1015. 
The wealth that your father has acquired through the haram job is described by the scholars as wealth that is haram because of the way in which it was acquired, i.e., he earned it in a haram manner. Some scholars are of the view that this wealth is haram only for the one who earns it, but for the one who takes it from him in a permissible way, it is not haram for him, such as if your father gives you a gift or spends on you and so on. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: Some of the scholars said that in the case of wealth that is haram because of the way in which it was acquired, the sin is only on the one who earned it, not on the one who takes it in a permissible way from the one who acquired it. This is unlike wealth that is haram in and of itself, such as alcohol, wealth seized by force, and so on. This view has a strong basis, because the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) bought food from the Jews for his family, and he ate from the lamb that the Jewish women gave him in Khaybar, and he accepted the invitation of a Jew, even though it is well known that most of the Jews consume riba and haram wealth. Perhaps this view is further supported by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) concerning the meat that was given in charity to Bareerah: “It is charity for her and a gift from her to us.” Al-Qawl al-Mufeed ‘ala Kitab al-Tawheed, 3/112.  
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: With regard to that which is haram because of the way in which it is acquired, such as that which is taken by means of deceit, or by means of riba, or by means of lying and so on, this is haram for the one who acquires it, but it is not haram for anyone else if he acquires it from him in a permissible manner. This is indicated by the fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to deal with the Jews even though they used to consume haram wealth and riba. This indicates that it is not haram for anyone other than the one who acquired it. Tafseer Soorat al-Baqarah, 1/198. 
Based on this, then you can inherit from your father and you do not have to keep track of what he has contributed to your business, or return what he contributed, but if you are cautious about consuming any of his wealth as much as you can, that is better. And Allah knows best.

45042,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45042,Ruling on tawarruq sales,"In recent years, local commercial banks have introduced a way of selling by installments, then the purchaser may sell the product to a third party for cash. Is this method permissible or not?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    This transaction is known to the scholars as tawarruq, 
    which comes from the word al-wariq, meaning silver, because the one 
    who buys the product is only buying it for the sake of dirhams (originally, 
    silver coins). 

    The scholars differed concerning the ruling on this 
    transaction. 

    The majority of scholars are of the view that it is 
    permissible, because of the general meaning of the verse in which Allaah 
    says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “whereas Allaah has 
    permitted trading”

    [al-Baqarah 2:275]

    and because there does not seem to be any intent to engage in 
    riba and there is no concept of riba in this case. End quote. 

    Al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 
    14/148 

    And because the purchaser is buying the product either to 
    benefit from the item itself or to benefit from its price. 

    This is the view favoured by the scholars of the Standing 
    Committee, and by Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on them all). 

    It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (13/161): 

    The issue of tawarruq is the subject of scholarly 
    debate, but the correct view is that it is permissible. End quote. 

    Shaykh Ibn Baaz said: 

    With regard to the issue of tawarruq, it is not riba 
    and the correct view is that it is permissible, because of the general 
    meaning of the evidence and because it facilitates relief and enables people 
    to meet their current needs. As for the one who sells it to the one from 
    whom he bought it, this is not permissible, rather this is a riba-based 
    transaction, which is called ‘aynah. This is haraam because it is a trick 
    aimed at getting around the prohibition on riba. End quote. 

    Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn Baaz, 
    19/245 

    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    was of the view that this transaction is haraam. See al-Fataawa al-Kubra, 
    5/392 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) adopted 
    a middle view, and said that it is permissible, subject to certain 
    conditions. 

    He said in Risaalah al-Mudaayanah: 

    The fifth type (of loan) is where a person needs money but 
    cannot find anyone to lend it to him, so he buys an item for a deferred 
    payment, then sells it to someone else, other than the one from whom he 
    bought it. This is the issue of tawarruq. 

    The scholars (may Allaah have mercy on them) differed at to 
    whether it is permissible. Some of them said that it is permissible because 
    if a man buys an item because he wants the item itself or he wants its price 
    (by selling it), and both are valid aims. 

    Some of the scholars said that it is not permissible, because 
    the aim is to take dirhams for dirhams, and the item comes in between as a 
    means of making the transaction permissible, and making a haraam thing 
    permissible by other means does not change anything. And the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Actions are but by 
    intentions, and each man will have but that which he intended.” 

    The view that this kind of tawarruq is haraam is that 
    favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, and it was narrated in one report 
    from Imam Ahmad. 

    According to the report of Abu Dawood, Imam Ahmad regarded it 
    as a type of ‘aynah, as was narrated by Ibn al-Qayyim in Tahdheeb 
    al-Sunan, 5/801. 

    But in light of the people’s needs nowadays and the lack of 
    lenders, we should say that it is permissible, subject to certain 
    conditions. 

    1-That the person be in need of 
    money; if he is not in need of money then it is not permissible, like those 
    who resort to this method in order to lend to others.

    2-That he should not be able to 
    obtain money in any other permissible manner, such as a loan. If he is able 
    to obtain money in some other manner, then this method is not permissible 
    because he has no need for it.

    3-That the contract should not 
    include anything that resembles forms of riba, such as saying, “I sell this 
    to you, the price of which is ten, for eleven” and so on. If it includes 
    such things then it is either makrooh or haraam. It was narrated that Imam 
    Ahmad said concerning such deals: such as if it is dirhams for dirhams, it 
    is not valid. This is the view of Imam Ahmad. Based on this, the correct 
    method is for the lender to know the value of the item and how much profit 
    he will make, then say to the borrower: I will sell it to you for such and 
    such, until one year.

    4-The borrower should not sell it 
    until he has taken possession of it and moved it to his own space, because 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade selling 
    an item before the traders move it to their own space. 
    

    If these four conditions are met, then the view that 
    tawarruq is permissible may be adopted, so as to relieve the people of 
    hardship. 

    It should be noted that it is not permissible for the 
    borrower to sell it to the lender for less than he bought it for under any 
    circumstances whatsoever, because this comes under the heading of ‘aynah.

Should I prostrate or not recite Qunut?","If the Adhan for Fajr is given while you are praying Witr, you should complete your prayer and there is nothing wrong with that.",,"Praise be to Allah.In the answer to question no. 46544  and 32577  we have explained that the time for Witr is from after `Isha’ prayer until dawn breaks. 
If the Mu’dhdhin (one who calls the Adhan) gives the Adhan for Fajr whilst you are praying Witr , then Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:  
What is prescribed for every believing man and woman is to pray Witr every night , the time of which lasts from `Isha’ prayer until dawn breaks, because it is narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The night prayers are two by two, then when you fear that dawn is about to break, pray one Rak`ah to make the number of Rak`ahs that you have prayed odd.” 
There are many Hadiths which speak of this. This indicates that Witr ends when dawn breaks. If a worshipper does not know when dawn breaks, he may rely on the Mu’dhdhin who is known to seek the correct time. When the Mu’dhdhin who is known to seek the correct time gives the Adhan, then the time for Witr has ended. But if he gives the Adhan before dawn then the time for Witr does not end when he gives the Adhan, and that does not mean that it has become prohibited for one who is fasting to eat and drink, or that the time for Fajr prayer has begun. 
From what we have mentioned, it is clear that the time for Witr ends with the first Adhan if the Mu’dhdhin is seeking the correct time of dawn for his Adhan. But if the Mu’dhdhin gives the Adhan when the Muslim is in the last Rak`ah, he should complete it because he cannot be certain that dawn has broken just from hearing the Adhan, and there is nothing wrong with that in sha Allah.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn Baz, 11/305) 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about a man who is praying Witr and whilst he is praying the Mu’dhdhin gives the Adhan for Fajr prayer. Should he complete his prayer? 
He replied: “Yes, if the Adhan is given whilst he is praying Witr , he should complete his prayer and there is nothing wrong with that.” (Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 14/115)

    Muslim (574) narrated from ‘Imraan ibn Husayn (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) prayed ‘Asr and said the tasleem after three rak’ahs, 
    then he went into his house. A man called al-Khirbaaq, who had long arms, 
    stood up and said: O Messenger of Allaah! And he told him what he had done. 
    He came out looking angry, dragging his cloak, and when he reached the 
    people he said: “Is this one telling the truth?” They said: Yes. So he 
    prayed one rak’ah, then he said the tasleem, then he prostrated twice, then 
    he said the tasleem. 

    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have 
    mercy on him) said: 

    If the prostration comes after the salaam, then he has to say 
    the salaam, then prostrate twice, then say the salaam.

     But does he have to recite the tashahhud? 

    There is a difference of opinion among the scholars 
    concerning this, but the correct view is that he does not have to say the 
    tashahhud. End quote. 

    Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (14/74). 

    The Standing Committee was asked: Should tashahhud be recited 
    after the prostration of forgetfulness or not, whether one does the 
    prostration of forgetfulness before the salaam or after? 

    They replied: 

    It is not prescribed to recite the tashahhud after the 
    prostration of forgetfulness if it is done before the salaam, without a 
    doubt. If it is done after the salaam then there is a difference of opinion 
    among the scholars, but the more correct view is that it is not prescribed 
    because it is not mentioned in the saheeh ahaadeeth. End quote.
