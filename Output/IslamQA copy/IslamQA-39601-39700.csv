Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni (4/106): 
We do not know of any difference of opinion among the scholars regarding the fact that zakah cannot be given to a kafir. Ibn al-Mundhir said: Everyone from whom we acquired knowledge among the scholars is agreed that a dhimmi (non-Muslim living under Muslim rule) cannot be given anything from the zakah, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to Mu’aadh: “Teach them that they are obliged to give zakah, to be taken from their rich and given to their poor.” He specified that it was to be given to their poor, i.e., the poor Muslims, just as he specified that it was to be taken from their rich. End quote. 
If a kafir is one of those who is inclined towards Islam, then he may be given something from the zakah, 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“As-Sadaqaat (here it means Zakah) are only for the Fuqaraa’ (poor), and Al‑Masaakeen(the poor) and those employed to collect (the funds); and to attract the hearts of those who have been inclined (towards Islam); and to free the captives; and for those in debt; and for Allah’s Cause (i.e. for Mujaahidoon — those fighting in a holy battle), and for the wayfarer (a traveller who is cut off from everything); a duty imposed by Allah. And Allah is All-Knower, All-Wise” [al-Tawbah 9:60]
It is permissible to give zakah to a kafir, if we hope that by giving him something he will become Muslim.  
See al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 6/143-145 
Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni, 4/108: 
The kafir should not be given anything of the zakah unless he is one of those who are inclined towards Islam. 
It says in al-Mawsoo’ah (14/233): 
Zakah may be given to a kafir who we hope will become Muslim, to encourage him to become Muslim because he is inclined towards Islam. End quote. 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz was asked: 
Is it correct to give zakah to a dhimmi? 
He replied:
 According to the majority of scholars, zakah cannot be given to a dhimmi or any other kafir. This is the correct view, and there are many verses and ahaadeeth which speak of this. Zakah is a means of help given by the Muslims to their poor, and to take care of their needs, so it must be distributed among their own poor and others among the eight categories mentioned in the verse, unless there are kafirs who it is hoped will become Muslim, namely the leaders who are obeyed among their tribes, who may be given zakah in order to encourage them to become Muslim, or so that they will withhold their evil from the Muslims. Zakah may also be given to new Muslims, to strengthen their faith or to encourage their peers to become Muslim too, or for other reasons that have been stated by the scholars. 
The basic principle concerning that is the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“As-Sadaqaat (here it means Zakah) are only for the Fuqaraa’ (poor), and Al‑Masaakeen(the poor) and those employed to collect (the funds); and to attract the hearts of those who have been inclined (towards Islam)…”
[al-Tawbah 9:60]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to Mu’aadh ibn Jabal when he sent him to Yemen: 
“Call them to testify that there is no god but Allah and that I am the Messenger of Allah. If they obey you in that, then teach them that Allah has enjoined upon them five prayers each day and night. If they obey you in that, then teach them that Allah has enjoined upon them charity (i.e., zakah) to be taken from their rich and given to their poor.” Agreed upon.

39661,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39661,Is it permissible to accept a gift from a man who deals in riba?,Is it permissible to accept a gift from a person who deals in riba?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to deal with the Jews, buying and selling, and he accepted gifts from them, even though they dealt in riba. 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“For the wrongdoing of the Jews, We made unlawful for them certain good foods which had been lawful for them — and for their hindering many from Allaah’s Way;
161. And their taking of Ribaa   (usury) though they were forbidden from taking it and their devouring of men’s substance wrongfully (bribery)”
[al-Nisa’ 4:160-161]
Despite that, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) accepted their gifts. He accepted the gift of the Jewish woman who brought the (roast) sheep in Khaybar, he interacted with them and when he died his shield was in pledge to a Jew. 
The basic principle here is: That which is forbidden because of the way in which it is earned is haraam only for the one who earns it, and not for the one who takes it from him in a permissible manner. Based on this, it is permissible to accept a gift from one who deals in riba, and it is also permissible to buy from him and sell to him, unless there is some interest to be served by shunning him, i.e., if there is some interest to be served by not dealing with him and not accepting his gifts. In that case we should do that in order to achieve that interest. With regard to that which is haraam in and of itself, it is haraam for the one who takes it and for others. So for example, if a Jew or a Christian who thinks that wine is permissible were to offer me some wine as a gift, it is not permissible for me to accept it because it is haraam in and of itself. If a person were to steal someone’s money and give it to me, it is haraam for me to take this stolen money because it is haraam in and of itself. 
This principle dispels a great deal of confusion. That which is haraam because of the way in which it was acquired is haraam only to the one who acquires it, not to anyone who takes it in a permissible manner, unless shunning him and not taking anything from him and not accepting his gift or dealing with him will serve an interest by deterring him from doing such things; in that case he should be shunned in order to achieve that purpose.","See: As’ilat al-Baab il-Maftooh, vol. 1, p. 76, by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him)"
39676,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39676,Ruling on sending blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the tashahhud,During Taraweeh prayer the imam very quickly says tasleem. I do get enough time to finish the first tashahudd. But he says tasleem before I could start the second tashahudd. Is it alright if I finish the prayer at that point. Or is the second tashahudd compulsory?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
The scholars differed concerning the ruling on sending blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the tashahhud in prayer. There are several opinions, one of which is that it is a pillar or essential part of the prayer, without which the prayer is not valid. Others said that it is obligatory, and the third view is that it is Sunnah and mustahabb, but is not obligatory. 
Shaykh Muhammad al-Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) regarded the third view as most likely to be correct. He said in his commentary on Zaad al-Mustaqni’: 
The words “Sending blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)” mean, in the last tashahhud, which is the twelfth “pillar” of the prayer. 
The evidence for that is the fact that the Sahaabah asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “O Messenger of Allah, we have learned how to send salaams upon you, how should we send blessings upon you?” He said: “Say: Allahumma salli ‘ala Muhammad, wa ‘ala aali Muhammad (O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad).” A command implies that it is obligatory, and the basic principle concerning an obligation is that it is a must (fard), and if it is not done, then the prayer is invalid. This is how the fuqaha (may Allah have mercy on them) settled this issue. 
But if you think about this hadeeth, it is not obvious therefrom that sending blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is a “pillar” of the prayer, because the Sahaabah were simply asking how to do it – how should we send blessings upon you? So the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught them how to do it. Hence we say that the command in the word “Qoolu (Say)” does not mean that it is obligatory; rather the purpose here was to teach them. If there is any other evidence which enjoins sending blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in prayer, then it must be followed; if there is nothing apart from this report, this does not indicate that it is obligatory, let alone indicating that it is a “pillar” of the prayer. Hence the scholars differed concerning this matter and there were several opinions: 
1 – The first opinion is that it is a “pillar” of prayer. This is the well-known view of our madhhab, that prayer is not valid without it. 
2 – The second view is that it is obligatory, but is not a “pillar”, and the prostration of forgetfulness (sujood al-sahw) is required if it is omitted by mistake. 
They said: That is because his words, “Say: Allahumma salli ‘ala Muhammad, wa ‘ala aali Muhammad (O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad)”  imply both a command and teaching, and we cannot say that it a “pillar” of the prayer without which prayer is not valid when it possible to understand the phrase as meaning that it is an obligatory part of prayer and not a “pillar”. 
3 – The third view is that sending blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is a Sunnah, and is not obligatory or a pillar of the prayer. This view was narrated from Imam Ahmad. If a person deliberately omits it, his prayer is still valid, because the evidence quoted by those who regard it as obligatory and those who regard it as a pillar of the prayer does not clearly indicate either of the things suggested, so the basic principle is that it is not essential. 
This is the view which is most likely to be correct because there is no other evidence apart from this report which the fuqaha’ (may Allah have mercy on them) quoted as evidence. We cannot regard an act of worship as being invalid because of evidence which may be understood as a command or may be understood as teaching. 
Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 3/310-312 
Based on this, a prayer offered without it is still valid. 
Secondly: 
This imam and others who rush through Taraweeh prayers in a negligent manner, thus preventing those who are behind them from completing their prayers, should be advised. 
The scholars have stated that the imam should perform the prayer slowly so that the members of the congregation can perform the obligatory parts and some of the Sunnahs; it is makrooh to hasten so much that the members of the congregation are not able to do that. 
Al-Nawawi said: 
The meaning of the ahaadeeth – i.e., the ahaadeeth which tell the imam to make the prayer light – on this topic are clear, which is the command to the imam to make the prayer light without omitting or falling short in any of the Sunnah actions of prayer. 
It says in al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (14/243): 
What is meant by making it light is keeping it at the lowest level of perfection, so he should do the obligatory parts and the Sunnahs, and not only do the least possible parts of the prayer or do it in the most perfect manner. 
Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said: 
It is unanimously agreed among the scholars that it is recommended for the imam to make the prayer light, i.e., at the lowest level of perfection, without omitting or neglecting any part of the prayer. Then he said: I do not know of any differing opinion among the scholars concerning the fact that it is mustahabb for everyone who leads the people in prayer to make the prayer light so long as it is still complete. 
Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni (1/323): 
It is mustahabb for the imam to recite Qur’aan, tasbeeh and the tashahhud in as slow a manner as one who is reciting it slowly behind him, and he should make his bowing and prostration as long as he thinks that the old, young and heavy need. If he does not do that, and he does it at his own pace without paying attention to the people behind him, it is makrooh but is still sufficient. 
In al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (6/213) it says: 
It is makrooh for him to rush so much that the one who is praying behind him cannot do the Sunnah, such as saying the tasbeeh three times when bowing and prostrating, and completing the Sunnah words in the final tashahhud. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said in an essay on the rulings on fasting, zakaah and Taraweeh: 
With regard to what some people do, hastening too much, this is contrary to what is prescribed in sharee’ah, and if he does it to such an extent that he omits an obligatory or essential part of the prayer, then it invalidates the prayer. 
Many imams do not perform Taraweeh prayer in a deliberate manner, and this is a mistake on their part, because the imam is not praying for himself only, rather he is praying for himself and others. He is like a leader who is obliged to do that which is in the best interests of all. The scholars stated that it is makrooh for an imam to rush in such a way that he prevents those praying behind him from doing what they are obliged to do. End quote.

1-Some are common to both and are said both when bowing and prostrating
2-Some are said only when bowing
3-Some are said only when prostrating.
The dhikrs that are common to both include the following: 
“Subhaanaka Allahumma Rabbana wa bihamdika Allahumma ighfir li (Glory and praise be to you O Allah, our Lord, O Allah forgive me).” 
It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) often used to say when bowing and prostrating: 
“Subhaanaka Allahumma Rabbana wa bihamdika Allahumma ighfir li (Glory and praise be to you O Allah, our Lord, O Allah forgive me).”
Narrated by al-Bukhaari (761) and Muslim (484). 
Another dhikr that is common to both is “Subbooh Quddoos Rabb ul-malaa’ikati wa’l-Rooh (Glorified, Holy, Lord of the angels and the Spirit)”. 
It was narrated from ‘Aa’ishah that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say when bowing and prostrating: “Subbooh Quddoos Rabb ul-malaa’ikati wa’l-Rooh (Glorified, Holy, Lord of the angels and the Spirit)”. Narrated by Muslim (487). 
Another common dhikr is: “Subhaana dhi’l-jabarooti wa’l-malakooti wa’l-kibriya’ wa’l-‘azamah (Glory be to the One Who has all power, dominion, magnificence and might).” 
It was narrated that ‘Awf ibn Maalik al-Ashja’i said: I prayed qiyaam with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) one night. He stood and recited Soorat al-Baqarah, and he did not come to any verse that spoke of mercy but he paused and asked (for mercy). He did not come to any verse that spoke of punishment but he paused and sought refuge with Allah.  Then he bowed for as long as he had stood, saying whilst bowing: “Subhaana dhi’l-jabarooti wa’l-malakooti wa’l-kibriya’ wa’l-‘azamah (Glory be to the One Who has all power, dominion, magnificence and might).” Then he prostrated for as long as he had stood, and he said something similar when prostrating, then he stood and recited Aal ‘Imraan, then he recited soorah by soorah. 
Narrated by al-Nasaa’i (1132)and Abu Dawood (873). Classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
Among the dhikrs that are recited only in rukoo’ is: “Subhaana Rabbiy al-‘Azeem (Glory be to my Lord the Almighty).” 
It was narrated that Hudhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I prayed with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) one night, and he started to recite al-Baqarah and I thought: he will bow when he reaches one hundred, but he carried on. Then I thought that he would finish it in the two rak’ahs, but he carried on. Then I thought he would bow after finishing it, but he started to recite al-Nisa’ and recited it all, then he started to recite Aal ‘Imraan and recited it all, reciting with a slow and measured pace. When he reached a verse that spoke of glorifying Allah, he glorified Allah; when he reached a verse that spoke of asking of Him, he asked of Him; when he reached a verse that spoke of seeking refuge with Him, he sought refuge with Him. Then he bowed and started saying, ‘Subhaana Rabbiy al-‘Azeem (Glory be to my Lord the Almighty).” And his bowing was almost as long as his standing. Then he said: “Sami’a Allahu liman hamidah (Allah hears those who praise Him).” Then he stood for a long time, almost as long as he had bowed. Then he prostrated and said, “Subhaan Rabbiy al-A’la (Glory be to my Lord Most High),” and his prostration was almost as long as his standing.
Narrated by Muslim (772). 
Among the dhikrs that are recited only when prostrating is: “Subhaana Rabbiy al-A’la (Glory be to my Lord Most High).” 
In the hadeeth of Hudhayfah quoted above it states that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say when prostrating: “Subhaana Rabbiy al-A’la (Glory be to my Lord Most High).” 
Abu Dawood (869) narrated that ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Aamir (may Allah be pleased with him) said: When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) bowed he said:  “Subhaana Rabbiy al-‘Azeem wa bi hamdihi (Glory and praise be to my Lord the Almighty)” three times, and when he prostrated he said: “Subhaana Rabbiy al-A’la wa bi hamdihi (Glory and praise be to my Lord the Most High)” three times. 
The scholars differed as to whether the additional phrase bi hamdihi (praise) is saheeh or da’eef. The narrator of this phrase, Abu Dawood, said: We are afraid that this phrase may not be sound; it was narrated only by the people of Egypt. 
Shaykh al-Albaani classed it as saheeh in Sifat al-Salah (The Prophet’s Prayer Described) p. 146, then later on he classed it as da’eef in Da’eef Sunan Abi Dawood (1/338-340). 
It was also rejected by Ibn al-Salah and others, as stated in al-Talkhees al-Habeer (1/243). 
Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni (1/297): Two reports are narrated from Imam Ahmad, one which says that he accepted it and another which says that he did not accept it. In the report that he did not accept it the reason give is the fact that the hadeeth without this additional phrase is more well-known. 
Ahmad ibn Hanbal was asked about it, according to a report narrated by Ibn al-Mundhir, and he said: As for me, I do not say bi hamdihi.

I would like to know whether the following story is true. During Mi’raj the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) smelt a pleasant smell like that of musk and when he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) questioned about it Jibreel (upon him be peace) answered that it is the smell coming from the beautician who worked in the Pharaoh’s palace (during Musa (upon him be peace) time). She was a secret convert but one day her faith was revealed when the comb fell from her hand and she said “Bismillah”. When Pharaoh heard of this he burnt her and her children . It is said that her infant son spoke to her at that moment and asked her to remain calm and steady in her faith. Due to her great eemaan Allah had elevated her position. Is this story true? Or are there any similar stories? Is this based on a Christian or Jewish source?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.The story of 
    the hairdresser of the daughter of Pharaoh is narrated as follows: 
It was 
    narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said:  The

    “On the night on which I was taken on the Night Journey (Isra’), a beautiful 
    fragrance came to me.  I said: O Jibreel, what is this beautiful fragrance? 
    He said: This is the fragrance of the hairdresser of Pharaoh’s daughter and 
    her children. I said: What is their story? He said: Whilst she was combing 
    the hair of Pharaoh’s daughter one day, the iron comb fell from her hand and 
    she said, ‘Bismillaah (in the name of Allaah).’ The daughter of Pharaoh 
    said: ‘My father?’ She said: ‘No. My Lord and the Lord of your father is 
    Allaah.’ She said: ‘I will tell him about that.’ She said: ‘Yes.’ So she 
    told him and he summoned her and said: ‘O So and so, do you have a Lord 
    other than me?’ She said: ‘Yes, my Lord and your Lord is Allaah.’ He ordered 
    that a baqarah (lit. “cow”) made of copper be heated up, then he 
    ordered that she and her children be thrown into it. She said: ‘I have a 
    request to make of you.’ He said: ‘What is your request?’ She said: ‘I would 
    like my bones and my children’s bones to be gathered together in one cloth 
    and buried.’ He said: ‘This will be done for you.’ He ordered that her 
    children be thrown into it in front of her, one by one, until they came to 
    the last one who was an infant boy who was still being breastfed. It was as 
    if she wavered because of him, but he said: ‘O mother, go ahead, for the 
    punishment of this world is easier to bear than the punishment of the 
    hereafter.’ So she went ahead.” Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) 
    said: Four infants spoke: ‘Eesa ibn Maryam (peace be upon him), the 
    companion of Jurayj, the witness of Yoosuf and the son of the hairdresser of 
    Pharaoh’s daughter. 
Narrated by 
    Imam Ahmad in al-Musnad (1/309), al-Tabaraani (12280), Ibn Hibbaan 
    (2903) and al-Haakim (2/496). 
Al-Dhahabi 
    said in al-‘Aluw (84): This hadeeth has a hasan isnaad. Ibn Katheer 
    said in al-Tafseer (3/15): There is nothing wrong with its isnaad. 
    Its isnaad was classed as saheeh by the scholar Ahmad Shaakir in his 
    commentary on al-Musnad (4/295). Al-Arna’oot said in Takhreej 
    al-Musnad (5/30-31, no. 2821): Its isnaad is hasan. 
Thus it is 
    clear that this story is saheeh and is proven from our Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and it is not taken from Jewish or 
    Christian sources. 
With regard 
    to the phrase “He ordered that a baqarah (lit. “cow”) made of copper 
    be heated up”, Ibn al-Atheer said in al-Nihaayah (1/145): Al-Haafiz 
    Abu Moosa said: It seems to me that this does not refer to something that 
    was made in the shape of a cow, rather it may have been a vast pot or 
    kettle, which they called a baqarah, taken from the word tabaqqur 
    which means vastness, or it may have been something that could have held a 
    whole cow because of its large size, so it was called thus.

39679,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39679,"The answer to the question posed by disbelievers, “Can Allaah create a rock that He cannot lift?”","This is a question, which is supposedly asked by missionaries. “Can Allah create a rock which He can’t lift?’ How do we respond to this?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.This question – and others like it – contain a great contradiction. Many disbelievers try to use such questions in their debates with Muslims, seeking to force the respondent to say either “No He can’t” in which case they will say, “How can He be a god if He cannot create something?” or if he says, “Yes, He can,” they will say: “How can He be a god if He is unable to carry or lift this rock?” 
The answer is: 
This question is not valid at all because the power of Allaah is not connected to irrationalities. How can He be a god if He is unable to lift their “rock,” when one of the attributes of Allaah is power? Can there be any attribute in any created thing that is greater than the attributes of its Creator? 
Professor Sa’d Rustam answered this question in a sound scientific manner, which we will quote in full here. He said: 
The power of Allaah – which is undoubtedly absolute and unlimited – is connected to things that are rationally possible, not things that are rationally impossible. No matter how absolute and limitless His power, it must still remain within the bounds of possibility, and it is not connected to irrationalities. This is not a limitation of it. In order to clarify this point we will give some examples: 
We ask all of these bishops and theologians: Can God create another god like Him? If they say yes, we say to them: How can this created being be a god if he is created? How can he be like God when he has a beginning, whereas God exists from eternity? In fact the phrase “creating a god” is a sophism or false argument, and is a contradiction in terms, because the mere fact that something is created means that it cannot be a god. This question is like asking could God create “a god who is not a god”? it is self-evident that the answer can only be: The power of Allaah has nothing to do with that, because the idea that something can be a god and not a god is illogical and is irrational, and the power of Allaah has nothing to do with irrationalities. 
Another example: We may also ask them: Can God really expel anyone from under His control? If they say yes, they have imposed a limit on the control of Allaah, and if they say no – which is correct – they have agreed with us that the power of Allaah is absolute and has nothing to do with irrationalities, because it is rationally impossible for any created being to be expelled from the control of its Creator. 
A third example: One day one of the disbelievers asked me: Can your Lord create a rock that is so huge that He would be unable to move it? And he added in a sarcastic manner: If you say, yes He can, you will have stated that your Lord is unable to move the rock, and this indicates that He is not a god, but if you tell me, No, He cannot, you will have admitted that He is not able to do all things, therefore He is not a god. 
I answered this disbeliever simply: Yes, it is not part of the power of Allaah that He is able to create a rock that He is unable to move, because everything that Allaah creates He is able to move, but the fact that it is impossible for the power of Allaah to be connected to the creation of this supposed rock does not indicate that He is lacking in power. Rather – on the contrary – it is indicative of His complete power, because this question of yours is like asking: Can Allaah be unable to do something that may be rationally possible? No doubt, if we say no, this does not mean that the power of Allaah is limited, rather it is an affirmation of the completeness of His power, because not being incapable means having power. If we say that Allaah cannot be unaware of or forget anything, saying that does not mean that He is incapable or is lacking, rather it is an affirmation of His perfection and complete power and knowledge. 
The Four Gospels and the Epistles of Paul and John deny the divinity of Christ as it is denied by the Qur’aan, by Sa’d Rustam.

39682,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39682,What is the best night to pray qiyaam if you can only do that once each month?,"If u can only pray qiymum laylul weekly, when is the best day of the week? if u can only pray it monthly, when i the best day of the month?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.There is no particular night which Islam tells us to single out from the other nights of the week or the month, rather you can pray whenever it is easy for you to do so and when you feel energetic. If you can pray qiyaam on more than one night each week or each month, that is better for you than praying only one night. 
You should avoid singling out the night before Jumu’ah for praying qiyaam, because of the clear prohibition on doing so. 
It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not single out the night of Friday from other nights for praying qiyaam, and do not single out Friday from other days for fasting, unless it is part of a fast that one of you regularly observes.” Narrated by Muslim, 1144. 
Al-Nawawi said: 
This hadeeth clearly indicates that it is forbidden to single out the night of Friday from other nights for praying, and to single out that day for fasting. It is unanimously agreed (among the scholars) that this is makrooh. 
Sharh Muslim, 8/20. 
But if a person prays qiyaam on Friday night, not because he is singling it out because it is Friday, but because it is a day when he is off work, then there is nothing wrong with that. Similarly if he fasts on a Friday because it is a day when he is off work, there is nothing wrong with that. 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz said: 
If the Day of ‘Arafat happens to fall on a Friday and a Muslim fasts on this day only, there is nothing wrong with that, because he is fasting because it is the Day of ‘Arafat, not because it is a Friday. Similarly, if he has days to make up from Ramadaan and he has no free time except on Friday, then there is no sin on him if he singles it out; that is because it is a day off for him. Similarly if the day of ‘Ashoora’ happens to fall on a Friday, there is no sin on him if he singles it out for fasting, because he is fasting because it is ‘Ashoora’ not because it is Friday. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not single out Friday for fasting, and do not single out the night of Friday for praying qiyaam.” So this hadeeth refers to singling it out, i.e., when a person does that just because it is Friday or the night of Friday. 
End quote, from Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn Baaz, 15/414 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’ (6/291): 
It is makrooh to single out Friday for fasting, and the evidence for that is the fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not fast on Friday unless you also fast a day before it or a day after it.” And he said: “Do not single out Friday for fasting or the night of Friday for praying qiyaam.” And he said to one of the Mothers of the Believers, when he found her fasting on a Friday: “Did you fast yesterday?” She said, “No.” He said: “Are you going to fast tomorrow?” She said: “No.” He said: “Then break your fast.” If she had fasted another day with it, he would not have objected. So if you fast Thursday and Friday, there is nothing wrong with it, or if you fast Friday and Saturday, there is nothing wrong with it. 
If a person fasts on Friday, not because he is singling it out, but because that is free time for him, such as a man who works every night of the week and has no free time except on Friday, is it makrooh for him (to fast on a Friday)? 
The answer, in my view, is that it depends. If we look at the report narrated by Muslim: “Do not single out Friday for fasting,” we say that there is nothing wrong with it, because this man is not singling it out as such. But if we look at the hadeeth ‘[He said:] “Did you fast yesterday?” She said, “No.” He said: “Are you going to fast tomorrow?” She said: “No.” He said: “Then break your fast”’, then it may be understood from this that it is makrooh to single out this day. But if he cannot fast on any other day, then it may be understood differently, and it may be said that what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said – “Did you fast yesterday… are you going to fast tomorrow?” – indicates that she was able to fast on other days. 
The point is that if a person singles out Friday for fasting, not because it is Friday, but because it is the day when he has free time, then it seems in sha Allah that it is not makrooh, and that there is nothing wrong with that. End quote.",Islam Q&A

How to overcome OCD","Praise be to Allah.Sources of Waswas
The waswas which people experience are not all of the same type or degree, either in terms of the type of sickness or in terms of its source and effect. 
The kind of waswas which tempts a person to listen to or look at haram (unlawful) things or to commit immoral actions, and makes such things appear attractive to him, comes from three sources: the nafs (or self), which is inclined to evil, the devils among the jinn (demons), and the devils among mankind. 
Allah says, describing the first source, which is the nafs (interpretation of the meaning):  
“And We have already created man and know what his soul whispers to him, and We are closer to him than [his] jugular vein” (Qaf 50:16)
Allah says, describing the second source, which is the devils among the jinn (interpretation of the meaning): 
Then Satan whispered to him; he said, ""O Adam, shall I direct you to the tree of eternity and possession that will not deteriorate?"" (Ta-Ha 20:120)
And Allah says, describing the third source, which is the devils among mankind (interpretation of the meaning): 
{Say, ""I seek refuge in the Lord of mankind, The Sovereign of mankind. The God of mankind, From the evil of the retreating whisperer - Who whispers [evil] into the breasts of mankind - From among the jinn and mankind.""} (al-Nas 114:1-6)
So these waswas may come from the jinn or from the sons of Adam (human beings). 
Please see question no. 59931
Source of Waswas in prayer and wudu: What happens to a Muslim regarding his wudu and prayer, where he does not know how many times he washed during wudu or how many rak’ahs (units of prayer) he did in prayer, comes from the Shaytan. If he seeks refuge with Allah from the Shaytan, Allah will suffice him against him. But if he gives in to him and responds to the waswas, the Shaytan will gain power over him, and that waswas will become a chronic problem. This is what is called al-waswas al-qahri (overwhelming waswas or OCD). 
What is OCD?
This kind of waswas – as one of those who are specialized in this field said – “is a sickness which befalls some people like any other kind of sickness. It refers to repeated thoughts, movements, ideas or notions which are of a loathsome nature that a person would ordinarily reject and strive to resist. He also realizes that they are wrong and have no meaning, but there is something that is pushing him towards them and he usually fails to resist them. The strength of these waswas may vary, so much so that they appear – to non-specialists – to be very strong and it seems that the sick person is doing that willingly. This kind of waswas may also affect a person in his worship and in his worldly affairs.” 
How to dispel waswas
The waswas of the Shaytan may be dispelled by seeking refuge with Allah. 
The waswas that comes from one’s own self may also be dispelled by seeking refuge with Allah, and by strengthening the connection between a person and his Lord by doing acts of worship and obedience and by giving up evil things. 
As for al-waswas al-qahri (OCD), it is a kind of sickness as stated above. 
Difference between different types of waswas
The difference between the waswas that comes from the Shaytan and the waswas that comes from the nafs is subtle, as was quoted by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) from some of the scholars. He said: 
“Abu Hazim made a comparison between the waswasah caused by the nafs and that caused by the Shaytan, and said: Whatever your nafs hates for your nafs is from the Shaytan, so seek refuge with Allah from it. And whatever your nafs likes for your nafs is from your nafs, so forbid it from it.” (Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 17/529, 530) 
I.e., the nafs usually whispers concerning things which are connected to its whims and desires, which people usually like. 
Some of the scholars pointed out another important difference, which is that the waswas that comes from the Shaytan makes sin appear attractive until the Muslim falls into it; if the Shaytan is unable to achieve that, he moves on to another sin, and if that does not work he moves on to a third, and so on. He does not care about making the Muslim fall into a particular sin, rather what he cares about is making the Muslim disobey his Lord, and it is all the same to him whether he makes him do something that is forbidden or omit something that is obligatory, for all of it is sin and disobedience. 
As for the waswas that comes from the nafs, it is what urges the person to commit a specific sin and repeatedly seeks to make him do it.  
Are we held accountable for waswas?
The Muslim will not be punished for the waswas that comes from the Shaytan or from his own nafs, so long as he does not speak of it or act upon it. But he is commanded to resist it, and if he neglects to resist it and gives in to it, then he will be punished for that neglect. 
He is commanded not to pay any attention to the waswas of the Shaytan, and to proceed on the basis of the smaller number (of rak’ahs) in prayer if he is not sure how many he has done. He is commanded to seek refuge from the Shaytan and spit dryly to his left three times if the waswas of the Shaytan comes to him whilst he is praying. He is commanded to keep company with good people and avoid bad people. Whoever is negligent with regard to any of these matters will fall into the traps of his nafs which is inclined to evil, or will respond to the devils among the jinn and mankind, in which case he will be held accountable. 
How to overcome OCD
As for overwhelming waswas (OCD), it is a kind of sickness – as mentioned above – so the Muslim will not be harmed by it and Allah will not hold him accountable for it, because it is beyond his control. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
Allah does not charge a soul except [according to] what He has given it. (al-Talaq 65:7)
So fear Allah as much as you are able (al-Taghabun 64:16) 
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah will forgive my ummah (followers) for whatever crosses their minds so long as they do not speak of it or act upon it.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 4968; Muslim, 127)
The one who is afflicted with this kind of waswas must always read Quran and recite the dhikrs (words of remembrance) prescribed in shari’ah (Islamic law), morning and evening. He must strengthen his faith by doing acts of worship and shunning evil. He must occupy himself in seeking knowledge, for although the Shaytan may gain power over a worshipper, he cannot gain power over one who has knowledge. 
The Shaytan may come and whisper evil things to a Muslim about Allah, or His Messenger, or His shari’ah, things that the Muslim hates and does not approve of. The fact that he resists these waswas and hates them is a sign of the soundness of his faith. So he should strive to control his nafs and not respond to the one who calls him to evil. 
Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
The phrase: Whether you show what is within yourselves or conceal it, Allah will bring you to account for it. (al-Baqarah 2:284 – interpretation of the meaning) means that even if He brings you to account and questions you, He will not punish you except for that which a person is able to ward off. As for that which he cannot ward off, such as the waswas of the nafs, no one is accountable for that, and hating evil waswasah is part of faith. (Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 1/343)
Al-Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: 
Waswas and ideas may cross a person’s mind, especially to do with tawhid (the oneness of Allah) and faith ; will the Muslim be held accountable for that? 
He replied: 
“It is narrated in al-Sahihayn and elsewhere that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah will forgive my ummah (followers) for whatever crosses their minds so long as they do not speak of it or act upon it.” (Agreed upon) And it is narrated that the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about the kinds of waswas and thoughts referred to in the question crossing their minds. He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) replied: “That is a clear sign of faith.” (Narrated by Muslim) And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The people will keep on wondering until it is said, ‘This was created by Allah, but who created Allah?’ Whoever experiences any of that, let him say, Amantu Billahi wa rusulihi (I believe in Allah and His messengers).’” (Agreed upon)  According to another report: “Let him seek refuge with Allah and stop it.” (Narrated by Muslim in his Sahih) (Tuhfatal-Ikhwan bi Ajwibah Muhimmah tata’allaq bi Arkan al-Islam (question no. 10)

39686,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39686,Sarah’s Jealousy Towards Hajar,When Hajar gave birth to Ismaeel (upon him be peace) was Sarah jealous of her? If so why would a noble lady like Sarah get jealous? Is her jealousy the reason why Ibraheem (upon him be peace) was ordered to send Hajar and Ismaeel (upon him be peace) to the desert?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
      A woman’s jealousy towards her co-wives is something that 
      is entirely natural, and it is not something that only some woman feel and not others. Hence she will not be called to account for it unless she 
      transgresses the limits and lets it lead to wronging her sister, which is 
      something that Allaah has forbidden, by backbiting or spreading gossip or 
      demanding the divorce of her co-wife or plotting against her and so on. 

    Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    Basically, jealousy is natural and is not something that only 
    some women feel and not others, but if a woman oversteps the mark then she 
    is to be blamed. The guideline concerning that is the hadeeth (narration) which was narrated from Jaabir ibn ‘Ateek al-Ansaari, who attributed it to the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “There is a kind of 
    jealousy which Allaah loves, and a kind which Allaah hates. As for the kind 
    of jealousy which Allaah loves, it is jealousy when there are grounds for 
    suspicion. And as for the kind of jealousy which Allaah hates, it is 
    jealousy when there are no grounds for suspicion.” 

    Classed as hasan (sound) by Shaykh al-Albaani in al-Irwa’, 
    7/80. 
So jealousy on the part 
    of the husband and wife, if it is of the type that is part of human nature 
    which no woman is free from, then it is excused, so long as she does not 
    overstep the mark and do or say anything that Allaah has forbidden. This is 
    the way in which the reports from the salaf (pious predecessors)which speak of women’s jealousy  are to be understood. 

    Fath al-Baari, 9/326. 

    Ibn Muflih (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
Al-Tabari and other 
    scholars said: Jealousy on the part of women is to be overlooked and they 
    are not to be punished for it because it is part of their nature. 

    Al-Adaab al-Shar’iyyah, 1/248 

    Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, 
    commenting on the hadeeth which describes ‘Aa’ishah breaking the vessel of 
    one of her co-wives: 

    They – i.e., all those who commented on this hadeeth – said: 
    this indicates that the jealous women is not to be taken to task for what she does, because in that case her reasoning is overshadowed by the strong anger that was provoked by jealousy. Abu Ya’la narrated from ‘Aa’ishah with an isnaad (chain) with which there is nothing wrong a marfoo’ (directly attributed to the Prophet)report which says: “A jealous woman cannot tell the bottom of the valley from its top.” Fath 
    al-Baari, 9/325 
The jealousy that 
    occurred on the part of the best of women is something which no one can 
    avoid, and they will not be taken to ask for it because it is not an action 
    that transgresses the laws of Allaah.  

    The jealousy that Sarah felt towards Hajar comes under this 
    heading. For a woman to ask her husband not to let her see her co-wife and 
    not to make her live with her is something that cannot be denounced. It 
    should be noted that the scholars said that Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) is 
    the one who took Hajar and her son away, and Sarah did not ask for that. 

    Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:  

    And it is said that Sarah was intensely jealous, so Ibraaheem 
    took Ismaa’eel and his mother to Makkah because of that. 

    Fath al-Baari, 6/401 

    This is also indicated by the words of Hajar: “O Ibraaheem, 
    will you go and leave us in this valley in which there are no people and 
    nothing?” She said that to him several times, and he did not answer her. 
    Then she said to him: “Is it Allaah Who has commanded you to do this?” He 
    said: “Yes.” She said: “Then He will not forsake us.” Narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari, 3184. 

    It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with 
    him) said: When what happened between Ibraaheem and his wife happened, he 
    went out with Hajar and Ismaa’eel, carrying a skin full of water…. Narrated 
    by al-Bukhaari, 3185. 

    Al-Haafiz said: 

    The words of Ibn ‘Abbaas – “When what happened between 
    Ibraaheem and his wife happened” -  “his wife” refers to Sarah and “what 
    happened” refers to Sarah’s jealousy when Haajar bore Ismaa’eel.

Is it at the beginning or while washing the face or can it be done at any time while making Wudu?,"It is better to form the intention when starting to do Wudu or shortly before, so that the intention will cover all parts of Wudu. What is obligatory is to have the intention when starting to do the obligatory parts of Wudu.","Is intention essential for acts of worship? 


What is the seat of the intention in Islam? 


When to Make Intention for Wudu","Praise be to Allah.Is intention essential for acts of worship? 
The intention (Niyyah) is essential for all acts of worship ; no act of worship – including Wudu – is valid without the intention. 
An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“The intention is an essential condition of Wudu , Ghusl and Tayammum being valid, and there is no difference of opinion among us concerning that. This is the view of Malik, Al-Layth ibn Sa`d, Ahmad ibn Hanbal and Dawud. They quoted as evidence the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allah, and worship none but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him).” [Al-Bayyinah 98:5]
Worshipping none but Allah with sincere devotion is an action of the heart; this is intention, and the command here shows that it is obligatory. 
From the Sunnah, we have the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Actions are but by intentions.”  
What is meant is that the ruling on an action is based on the intention behind it. 
Another piece of evidence is the Hadith in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Every person will have but that which he intended.” If he did not intend to do Wudu then he has not done Wudu, and so on.” (Al-Majmu`, 1/356. See also Al-Mughni, 1/156)
What is the seat of the intention in Islam? 
It should be noted that the seat of the intention is the heart, and it is not prescribed to utter it out loud.
When to Make Intention for Wudu
It is better to form the intention when starting to do Wudu or shortly before, so that the intention will cover all parts of Wudu. What is obligatory is to have the intention when starting to do the obligatory parts of Wudu. 
Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Mughni, (1/159): 
“The intention must precede the entire act of purification, because it is an essential condition thereof, so it is regarded as being essential throughout. If any of the obligatory parts of the act of purification take place before the intention, they do not count. It is recommended to form the intention before washing one's hands, so that the intention will cover both the Sunnah parts of the purification and the obligatory parts. If a person washes his hands before forming the intention, he will be like one who has not washed his hand. It is permissible to form the intention shortly before purifying oneself… but if there is a long time in between, that is not sufficient.” 
Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti’ (1/140): 
“The intention is either of two things: 

Either it is Sunnah, which is if it is done before a Sunnah act of purification that comes before an obligatory act’ 
Or it is required when doing the first obligatory action. End quote. 

Based on this, it is better to form the intention before starting to do Wudu, and it is obligatory to have the intention when doing the first of the obligatory actions of Wudu. The scholars differed as to which is the first obligatory action of Wudu. It was said that it is saying Bismillah , or rinsing out the mouth – which is the correct view – or washing the face. 
But if a person forms the intention with the first obligatory action of Wudu, he will not be rewarded for whatever Sunnahs of Wudu he did before that, such as saying Bismillah and washing the hands three times, as stated above in the words of Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him).” 
Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“It is proven from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that the first part of Wudu is to wash the hands three times, with the intention of doing Wudu, and to say Bismillah.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 10/98)

39689,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39689,Rulings on changing the intention of a prayer after starting it,Is it alright to change the intention of a prayer after beginning it?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was asked about changing the intention in prayer. 
He replied: 
Changing the intention means either changing it from one specific thing to another, or from something general to something specific. This is not correct, but if it is changing it from something specific to something general, then there is nothing wrong with that. 
For example: 
Changing from one specific thing to another: A person wanted to change the Sunnah prayer of Duha to the regular prayer of Fajr which he had missed and wanted to make up. He said takbeer with the intention of offering two rak’ahs of Duha, then he remembered that he had not offered the regular prayer of Fajr, so he changed it to the regular prayer of Fajr. This is not valid, because the regular prayer of Fajr is two rak'ahs for which he should have had the intention from the beginning of the prayer. 
Another example is a man who started to pray ‘Asr, but whilst praying he remembered that he had not prayed Zuhr, so he intended this prayer to be Zuhr. This is also not valid, because the intention for a specific prayer must be there from the outset. 
With regard to changing from something general to something specific, such as if a person started to offer a general (i.e., naafil) prayer, then he remembered that he had not prayed Fajr or the Sunnah of Fajr, so he changed his intention to Fajr prayer or the Sunnah of Fajr – this is also not valid. 
But if he changes from something specific to something general, such as if he starts praying with the intention that it is the regular prayer of Fajr, then whilst he is praying he remembers that he has already offered this prayer, in that case he may change his original intention to the intention to simply offer a prayer. 
Another example is that of a man who starts to offer an obligatory prayer on his own, then a group (jamaa’ah) comes along, and he wants to change his obligatory prayer to a naafil prayer so that he may cut it short and offer two rak'ahs only, then offer the obligatory prayer with the group. This is permissible, because he is changing from something specific to something general. 
So the principle is: 
Changing from one specific thing to another is not valid; changing from something general to something specific is not valid; changing from something specific to something general is valid. 
End quote from Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 12/ Question no. 347. 
The Shaykh was also asked: 
Is it permissible to change one’s intention from one specific thing to another? 
He replied: It is not permissible to change one’s intention from one specific thing to another, or from something general to something specific. Rather it is only permissible to change one's intention from something specific to something general. 
An example of the first, changing one's intention from one specific thing to another, is changing the intention from praying Zuhr to praying ‘Asr. In this case the Zuhr prayer is invalidated, because one has turned away from it, and ha has not started ‘Asr prayer because that was not the intention from the outset. In that case both prayers must be made up. 
An example of the second, changing from something general to something specific, is when a person starts to pray a general naafil prayer, then turns the intention to a specific naafil prayer, then he changes it into regular Sunnah prayer, i.e., a man starts to pray with a general intention, then he wants to make it the regular Sunnah prayer of Zuhr – for example. But this does not count as the regular Sunnah prayer, because he did not have that intention from the outset. 
An example of the third, changing from something specific to something general, is when a person intends to offer the regular Sunnah prayer of Maghrib, then he decides to make it a general Sunnah prayer. This is valid and does not invalidate the prayer, because the intention to perform a specific prayer includes the intention to offer prayer in general, so if the specific intention is cancelled out, the general intention still remains, but if he does that, then his regular Sunnah prayer does not count because he has turned away from it.
