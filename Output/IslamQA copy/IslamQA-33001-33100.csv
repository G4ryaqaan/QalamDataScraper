33007,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/33007,Her fiancé does not pray and deals with riba. Should she go ahead with the wedding?,"I have become engaged to a young man who is of good character as far as I know, and he told me that he never misses prayers. But after we got engaged I found out that he does miss some prayers and fasts, and that he puts his money in a bank with riba (interest). But he tells me that he chose me to help him get rid of his bad deeds and sins, because he saw that I am religiously committed and I dress properly. Now I am wondering how I can help him with his religious commitment, and whether there will be any sin on me if I marry this person because I know that the one who does not pray is a kaafir. I thought of leaving him but the most hated of permissible things in the sight of Allaah is divorce. Now I have been engaged for a year and I have not been able to change anything in him, and I cannot leave him, and I do not think that I can live with anyone else. His is a good person but I do not know what to do. Please help me, may Allaah reward you with good.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The one who does not pray at all is a kaafir as you mention, whether he does not pray because he denies that prayer is obligatory or because he is lazy. This is according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions. Some of the scholars even said that one who delays an obligatory prayer until its time is over is a kaafir. 
It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (6/30) concerning the case of a woman who delays the prayers until their time is over and encourages her grown-up and small daughters to do likewise: 
“If her situation is as described, then she is an apostate who is corrupting her daughters and the daughters of her husband. She should be asked to repent, and if she repents and reforms, then praise be to Allaah. But if she persists in that, then her case should be referred to the ruler to separate her from her husband, and the hadd punishment should be carried out on her, namely execution, because of the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever changes his religion, kill him.” This is if she delays the prayers until their time is over, such as delaying ‘Asr until the sun goes down, or delaying Fajr until the sun rises, because delaying them until the time is over with no legitimate shar’i excuse comes under the same ruling as not praying.” 
Based on this, it is not permissible for you to marry this young man no matter how nice his character. What good character can be left after abandoning prayer and dealing in riba?! 
So long as he has not repented from that and the signs of righteousness have not appeared in him, then you should reject his proposal of marriage. If the marriage contract has already been done then you should tell him that the contract is not valid because he does not pray and it is not permissible for a Muslim woman to marry a kaafir. But if he repents and prays regularly on time, then you must make a new marriage contract with him, because the first contract was not valid. 
Do not be deceived by his words and promises. If he does not keep his word during the engagement period, then do not expect him to keep his word after that. 
Your saying that you cannot leave him is a trick of the Shaytaan. Rather you can do that, by putting your trust in Allaah and seeking what is with Him, and because of your fear of falling into that which is haraam.  It is not right for a kaafir to be the husband of a Muslim woman under any circumstances. 
It seems from your question that the marriage contract has been done, because you say that the most hated of permissible things in the sight of Allaah is divorce, but at the end of your question you mention engagement. If the marriage contract has not yet been done, then we would remind you that the fiancé is a non-mahram for his fiancée and it is not permissible for him to be alone with her or to see any part of her, or for her to speak to him in an alluring voice or to speak to him needlessly. All that is permissible at the time of engagement is for him to see of her that which will encourage him to marry her, without being alone with her. 
The best advice we can give you is to fear Allaah in private and in public, and to pray to Allaah to bless you with a good and righteous husband. 
And Allaah knows best.",Islam Q&A
33020,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/33020,He found a baby and adopted him – what is the ruling?,"My father found a baby at the top of a mountain and saved his life. My mother looked after him and her breasts started producing milk without her having a child of her own, so she breastfed him for two years. The child grew up and was brought up with us, and my father gave him his name. My father and mother have both died, and my father left instructions in his will that this boy should inherit along with us. Is it permissible for him to inherit along with us, and what is the ruling on his relationship with the women of our family?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
Your father and mother are to be thanked for 
    what they did, taking care of this foundling until he grew up. 
Secondly: 
Radaa’ah or the 
    breastfeeding that makes the child a mahram means giving five or more feedings within the first two years of the child’s life. If your mother 
    breastfed this child in this manner, then he becomes a son for her and her husband through breastfeeding, and he becomes a brother to all their 
    children through breastfeeding. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Forbidden to you (for marriage) are: your 
    mothers, your daughters… your foster milk suckling sisters”
[al-Nisa’ 4:23] 
“The mothers shall give suck to their 
    children for two whole years, (that is) for those (parents) who desire to complete the term of suckling”
[al-Baqarah 2:233]
And it was proven that the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Relations through radaa’ah (breastfeeding) makes all those things unlawful which are unlawful 
    through corresponding birth (blood) relations (i.e., prohibited marriages).” Narrated by Maalik, 2/601; a similar version was narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari, 3/149; Muslim, 2/1086. And it was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: “One of the things that was revealed 
    in the Qur’aan was that ten recognized breastfeedings makes all those things unlawful which are unlawful through corresponding birth (blood) 
    relations, then that was abrogated and replaced with a verse that mentioned five, and the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) passed away when that was the ruling.” Narrated by Maalik, 2/608; Muslim, 2/1075 
It should be noted that what is considered to 
    be one breastfeeding is when the child takes hold of the nipple and sucks milk from it; if he lets go, then comes back and sucks more milk, this 
    is a second breastfeeding, and so on. 
Thirdly: 
It is not permissible for the child mentioned 
    to take your father’s name as if he is one of his sons. 
Fourthly: 
The child mentioned cannot inherit from your 
    father, because he is not one of his heirs. 
Fifthly: 
If it is proven that your father left one-third or less of his estate to the child mentioned, 
    there is nothing wrong with that; you may also keep in touch with him and treat him kindly, for Allaah will never cause the reward of those who do 
    good to be lost. 
And Allaah is the Source of strength.","Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah li’l-Buhooth al-‘Ilmiyyah wa’l-Ifta’, 16/11"
