Unintentional mistakes with regard to some worldly matters","Praise be to Allah.Are Prophets infallible?
The Prophets are the best of mankind, and the most noble of creation before Allah. Allah chose them to convey the call of La ilaha ill-Allah (none has the right to be worshipped but Allah) to mankind, and Allah has made them the intermediaries between Him and His creation in conveying His Laws. They were commanded to convey the message from Allah, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
 “They are those whom We gave the Book, Al-Hukm (understanding of the religious laws), and Prophethood. But if these disbelieve therein (the Book, Al-Hukm and Prophethood), then, indeed We have entrusted it to a people (such as the Companions of Prophet Muhammad) who are not disbelievers therein.” [Al-An`am 6:89] 
The Prophets’ task was to convey the message from Allah even though they were human, hence the issue of infallibility may be examined from two angles: 

Infallibility in conveying the message
Infallibility from human error 

Infallibility of Prophets in conveying the message
The Prophets were infallible in conveying the message from Allah. They did not conceal anything that Allah had revealed to them, and they did not add anything from themselves. Allah said to His Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) (interpretation of the meaning): 
 “O Messenger (Muhammad)! Proclaim (the Message) which has been sent down to you from your Lord. And if you do not, then you have not conveyed His Message. Allah will protect you from mankind.” [Al-Ma'idah 5:67] 
“And if he (Muhammad) had forged a false saying concerning Us (Allah), We surely would have seized him by his right hand (or with power and might),  And then We certainly would have cut off his life artery (aorta), And none of you could have withheld Us from (punishing) him.” [Al-Haqqah 69:44-47]
Allah also says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And he (Muhammad) withholds not a knowledge of the Unseen.” [Al-Takwir 81:24]
Shaykh `Abd Ar-Rahman ibn Sa`di (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on this verse: “He is not stingy with that which Allah has revealed to him, concealing some of it. Rather he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was the most trustworthy of the inhabitants of heaven and the people of earth, the one who conveys the message of his Lord, the faithful conveyor (of the message). He does not withhold any part of it, from rich or poor, from ruler or subject, from male or female, from city-dweller or Bedouin. Hence Allah sent him to an illiterate and ignorant nation, and he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not die until they had become knowledgeable scholars, steeped in knowledge…”
Thus, with regard to conveying the religion of his Lord, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not make any mistakes at all, whether major or minor, rather he was infallible and under the constant protection of Allah. 
Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Fatawa Ibn Baz, (6/371): 
“All the Muslims are unanimously agreed that the Prophets (peace be upon them) – especially Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) – are infallible and protected from error in that which they conveyed from Allah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“By the star when it goes down (or vanishes). Your companion (Muhammad) has neither gone astray nor has erred. Nor does he speak of (his own) desire. It is only a Revelation revealed. He has been taught (this Quran) by one mighty in power [Gabriel].” [An-Najm 53:1-5]
Our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is infallible in all that he conveyed from Allah, in word and action and in what he approved of. There is no dispute on this point among the scholars.”
The Ummah agreed that the Messengers are infallible in their conveying the message. They did not forget anything that Allah revealed to them, except for things that were abrogated. Moreover, Allah guaranteed His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that he would remember it and would not forget it, except for that which Allah wanted him to forget, and He guaranteed that he would remember the whole Quran in his heart. Allah said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“We shall make you recite (the Quran), so you (O Muhammad) shall not forget (it).” [Al-A’la 87:7] 
“It is for Us to collect it and to give you (O Muhammad) the ability to recite it (the Quran). And when We have recited it to you [O Muhammad through Jibreel (Gabriel)], then follow its (the Quran’s) recitation.” [Al-Qiyamah 75:17-18]
Shaykh Al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him)] said in Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 18/7]: 
“The verses which point to the Prophethood of the Prophets indicate that they are infallible with regard to the message that they convey from Allah, so what they convey from their Lord can only be true. This is the meaning of Prophethood and this implies that Allah tells [the Prophet] of the unseen and he tells the people of the unseen. So the Messenger is commanded to call people and to convey the message to them.” 
Infallibility of the Prophets from human errors
With regard to the Prophets as people, they may make mistakes. This may be discussed as follows: 
They do not commit major sins
With regard to major sins, the Prophets do not commit major sins at all , and they are protected from such major sins both before their missions began or afterwards. 
Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 4/319: 
“The view that the Prophets are infallible and protected against committing major sins , as opposed to minor sins, is the view of the majority of Muslim scholars and of all groups. It is also the view of the scholars of Tafsir and Hadith and jurists. Indeed, nothing has been narrated from any of the Salaf, Imams, the Companions, the generation after them, and those who followed them except that which is in accordance with this view.” 
Matters that have nothing to do with conveying the message and the revelation 
With regard to minor sins, these may be committed by them, or by some of them. Hence the majority of scholars are of the view that they are not infallible when it comes to minor sins. Nonetheless, if they committed such actions they were not left to persist therein, rather Allah pointed that out to them and they hastened to repent therefrom. 
The evidence that they might commit minor sins and that they were not left to persist therein is:

The verses in which Allah says of Adam (interpretation of the meaning): 

“Thus did Adam disobey his Lord, so he went astray.  Then his Lord chose him, and turned to him with forgiveness, and gave him guidance.” [Ta-Ha 20:121-122] 
This indicates that Adam committed sin, but he was not left to persist therein, and he repented to Allah from that. 

Also, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“He said: `This is of Satan’s doing, verily, he is a plain misleading enemy.’ He said: `My Lord! Verily, I have wronged myself, so forgive me.’ Then He forgave him. Verily, He is the Oft-Forgiving, the Most Merciful.” [Al-Qasas 28:15-16]
So Moses (peace be upon him) confessed his sin and sought forgiveness from Allah after he killed the Egyptian, and Allah forgave him his sin.

Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“…and he [Dawud] sought forgiveness of his Lord, and he fell down prostrate and turned (to Allah) in repentance. So We forgave him that, and verily, for him is a near access to Us, and a good place of (final) return (Paradise).” [Sad 38:23-24]
Dawud’s sin was hastening to pass judgement before hearing the case of the second disputant.

Our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was rebuked by his Lord for several things that are mentioned in the Quran, such as the following (interpretation of the meaning): 

 “O Prophet! Why do you forbid (for yourself) that which Allah has allowed to you, seeking to please your wives? And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [At-Tahrim 66:1]
This refers to the well-known story with some of his wives.

Allah also rebuked His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) concerning the prisoners of war at Badr: 

Muslim (4588) narrated that Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: When the prisoners were taken captive, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to Abu Bakr and `Umar (may Allah be pleased with them): “What do you think about these prisoners?” Abu Bakr said: “O Prophet of Allah, they are our cousins and kinsmen. I think that we should accept a ransom from them which will give us some support against the disbelievers, and perhaps Allah will guide them to Islam.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “What do you think, O Ibn Al-Khattab?” He said: “I say, no, by Allah, O Messenger of Allah. I do not agree with Abu Bakr. I think that you should hand them over to us so that we may strike their necks (execute them). Hand over `Aqil to `Ali so that he may strike his neck, and hand over So and so – a relative of `Umar – to me, for these are the leaders and veterans of disbelief.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) liked what Abu Bakr said and he did not like what I [`Umar] said. The next day I came and found the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and Abu Bakr weeping. I said: “O Messenger of Allah, tell me, what has made you and your companion weep? If there is a reason to weep, I will weep with you, and there is no reason, I will force myself to weep in sympathy with you because you are weeping.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I am weeping because I was shown the torture to which they were subjected. It was brought as close to me as this tree” – a tree which was near the Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) – then Allah revealed the words (interpretation of the meaning): 
“It is not for a Prophet that he should have prisoners of war (and free them with ransom) until he had made a great slaughter (among his enemies) in the land. You desire the good of this world (i.e. the money of ransom for freeing the captives), but Allah desires (for you) the Hereafter. And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.
Were it not a previous ordainment from Allah, a severe torment would have touched you for what you took.
So enjoy what you have gotten of booty in war, lawful and good.” [Al-Anfal 8:67-69]
So Allah permitted booty to them. 
From this Hadith it is clear that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) chose to ransom the prisoners, this was a decision that he made by Ijtihad after consulting his companions, and he had no revelation from Allah concerning that. 

The words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): 

“(The Prophet) frowned and turned away.
Because there came to him the blind man (i.e. `Abdullah ibn Umm Maktum, who came to the Prophet while he was preaching to one or some of the Quraysh chiefs).” [`Abas 80:1-2]
This is the famous story of the great companion `Abdullah ibn Umm Maktum (may Allah be pleased with him) and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), when Allah rebuked him. 
Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Majmoo’ Al-Fatawa (4/320): 
“What has been narrated from the majority of scholars is that they (the Prophets) are not infallible with regard to minor sins, but they are not left to persist therein. They do not say that this does not happen under any circumstances. The first group from whom it was narrated that they are infallible in all cases, and who say that the most, are the Rafidis (Shi’ah), who say that they are infallible and protected even against forgetfulness and misunderstanding.” 
Some people think this is too much to suggest that Prophets may commit sin, and misinterpret some of the texts of the Quran and Sunnah which indicate that. Two specious arguments lead them to do that: 

The fact that Allah has commanded us to follow the Messengers and take them as our example. The command to follow them is taken as meaning that everything they did is an example for us to follow, and that every action and belief of theirs is an act of worship. If we suggest that that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) committed a sin, there will be a dilemma, because that implies that we are commanded to imitate this sin which was committed by the Prophet because we are commanded to follow his example, but at the same time we should no agree with it or do it, because it is a sin.  

This argument is valid and is appropriate if the sin is hidden and not obvious in such a way that it could be confused with acts of obedience. But Allah has explained to His Messengers where they went wrong and enabled them to repent without delay. 

Sins contradict perfection and are a shortcoming. This is true if they are not accompanied by repentance, for repentance brings forgiveness of sin, and does not contradict perfection or bring blame upon a person. Rather in many cases a person may be better after repenting than he was before he fell into sin. It is well known that no Prophet committed sin but he hastened to repent and seek forgiveness. The Prophets did not persist in sin or delay repentance, for Allah protected them from that, and after repenting they became more perfect than they were before.   

Unintentional mistakes with regard to some worldly matters
With regard to mistakes in some worldly matters, it is permissible for them to make such mistakes although their reason is sound and their insight is strong. This happened to several of the Prophets including our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). This happened with regard to various spheres of life such as medicine, agriculture, etc. 
Muslim (6127) narrated that Rafi ibn Khadij (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came to Madinah and found them pollinating the palm trees. He said: “What are you doing?” They said: “We always do this.” He said: “Perhaps if you do not do it, that will be better.” So they did not do it, and the harvest failed. They told him about that and he said: “I am only human. If I tell you to do something with regard to your religion, then do it, but if I tell you to do something based on my own opinion, then I am only human.” Hence it is known that the Prophets are infallible and protected from error with regard to the Revelation, so we should beware of those who cast aspersions upon the Messenger’s conveying of the Message and about laws he legislated, and say that it is his own personal opinion. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) could never do such a thing. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Nor does he speak of (his own) desire.
It is only a Revelation revealed.” [Al-Najm 53:3-4]
The Standing Committee was asked: Do the Prophets and Messengers make mistakes? 
They replied: 
“Yes, they make mistakes but Allah does not let them persist in their mistakes, rather He points out their mistakes to them as a mercy to them and their nations, and He forgives them for their mistakes, and accepts their repentance by His Grace and Mercy, for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful, as will be clear to anyone who studies the verses of the Quran which speak of that.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Al-Da’imah, 3/194)

42220,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/42220,For how long does a father have to spend on his child?,"My sister’s son came to live with me after living with his father, and I agreed to that on condition that he send me a monthly sum of 500 riyals. After a while he stopped sending the money and claimed that his son was not doing anything good for him because he was so far away from him, and that we should meet all his needs of food, drink, clothing, marriage, a car and so on. His father refused to send his son’s medical file for him to receive treatment at the expense of the company for which he works. Do we have the right, according to sharee’ah, to demand that he spend on his son who is now 16 years old and is studying in high school?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.A man is obliged to spend on his parents and children if they are in need and are poor. 
Al-Khuraqi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
A man is obliged to spend on his parents and on his children – male and female – if they are poor and he has enough to spend on them. 
Ibn Qudaamah said:  
The basic principle is that a man is obliged to spend on his parents and children, according to the Quran and Sunnah and scholarly consensus. 
With regard to the Quranic evidence, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Then if they give suck to the children for you, give them their due payment”
[al-Talaaq 65:6] 
So the payment for breastfeeding the child is incumbent upon the father.  
And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“but the father of the child shall bear the cost of the mother’s food and clothing on a reasonable basis”
[al-Baqarah 2:233]
And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. And that you be dutiful to your parents”
[al-Isra’ 17:23]
Being dutiful includes spending on them if they are in need. 
Evidence from the Sunnah includes the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Take what is sufficient for you and your child, on a reasonable basis.” Agreed upon. 
‘Aa’ishah narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of what a man consumes is what he earns, and his children are part of his earnings.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 3528; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel. 
With regard to scholarly consensus: 
Ibn al-Mundhir said: The scholars are unanimously agreed that spending on poor parents who have no income and no wealth is an obligation upon the son’s wealth. All of the scholars from whom we acquired knowledge are agreed that a man is obliged to spend on his children who have no wealth. 
Al-Mughni, 8/169, 170 
This spending which is a duty of the father is subject to certain conditions: the son should be in need of that money and be unable to earn himself either because he is too young or he is sick, etc., and the father should be able to afford it. 
Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: 
For spending to be obligatory three conditions must be met: 
1 – they should be poor, with no wealth or income which makes them independent of means and able to do without others spending on them. If they have enough wealth or income to be independent of means, then there is no obligation to spend on them, because spending is for help, and the one who is independent of means does not need any help. 
2 – The one who is obliged to spend on them should have enough to spend on them, in addition to what he needs to spend on himself, either from his wealth or his income. If a person does not have any surplus, then he is not obliged to spend on them, because Jaabir narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If one of you is poor, let him start with himself; if he has any surplus wealth let him spend on his dependents, and if there is anything left after that let him spend on his relatives.” According to another version: “Start with yourself then with your dependents.” A saheeh hadeeth. And Abu Hurayrah narrated that a man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: “O Messenger of Allah, I have a dinar.” He said: “Spend it on yourself.” He said: “I have another.” He said: “Spend it on your child.” He said: “I have another.” He said: “Spend it on your wife.” He said: “I have another.” He said: “Spend it on your servant.” I said: “I have another.” He said, “You know best (on whom to spend it).” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 1691. Shaykh al-Albaani said: It is hasan in Sunan Abi Dawood. 
Because this is a kind of help, it is not obligatory for one who is in need, as is also the case with zakaah. 
3 – The who is spending should be an heir of the one on whom he is spending, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And on the (father’s) heir is incumbent the like of that (which was incumbent on the father)”
[al-Baqarah 2:233]
because the heirs are closely related, so the heir is more entitled to the money of the one from whom he would inherit than anyone else is, so the obligation of spending should apply to him in exclusion of all others. 
Al-Mughni, 8/168, 169 
So the father should spend on his son’s needs until he becomes independent of means. The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) have stated that among the things on which a father is obliged to spend for his son is the expense of marriage if he needs to get married. 
Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
Our companions said: The father must keep his son chaste if he is obliged to spend on him and if he needs help to remain chaste (by getting married). This is the view of some of the companions of al-Shaafa’i. 
Al-Mughni, 8/172 
Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan (may Allah preserve him) said: 
The son’s rights over his father come to an end when he becomes independent of means. When he grows up and starts to earn a living for himself, and is independent of means because of that earning, then his right of having his father spend on him comes to an end. But so long as he is still young, or he is grown up but is not yet independent of means and is unable to earn a living, then it remains his father’s duty to spend on him until he becomes independent of means. This is an obligation dictated by their close ties of kinship.  
Al-Muntaqa min Fataawa Shaykh al-Fawzaan, 3/240 
In conclusion: The father has to fear Allah with regard to those who have been entrusted to his care. If he is able to spend on his son’s education, medical care and other needs, then it is not permissible for him to fall short with regard to that. 
Our advice to you is that before you take this matter to court, you should ask good and righteous people to intervene and advise and exhort the father, and seek to bring about a reconciliation between him and his son. If he agrees to spend on his son willingly without getting the courts involved, that is better for the father’s peace of mind and will make him better disposed towards his son. 
Our advice to the son is to look for work which will make him independent of means so that he will not need to rely on his father – especially since the son has reached the age of manhood. He should try to combine work and study, which is a simple matter that has been done by many before him, for whoever seeks to become independent of means, Allah will help him. 
If he is unable to do that and the father persists in his attitude, then in that case there is nothing wrong with referring the matter to a sharee’ah judge (qaadi) to make the father do what he is obliged to do according to sharee’ah. But the more you are able to keep the matter away from courts and legal disputes, the better.

Plants are food for people and animals. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):

And gardens dense with many trees,
And fruits and herbage.

Plants remind man that this world will come to an end: 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, the likeness of (this) worldly life is as the water (rain) which We send down from the sky; so by it arises the intermingled produce of the earth of which men and cattle eat: until when the earth is clad in its adornments and is beautified, and its people think that they have all the powers of disposal over it, Our Command reaches it by night or by day and We make it like a clean-mown harvest, as if it had not flourished yesterday! Thus do We explain the Ayaat in detail for the people who reflect”
[Yoonus 10:24]
Allaah gives people the likeness of the resurrection of the dead and their coming forth from their graves, by reminding them of what they see of the earth coming back to life after it was dead. He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And among His Signs (in this), that you see the earth barren, but when We send down water (rain) to it, it is stirred to life and growth (of vegetations). Verily, He Who gives it life, surely is Able to give life to the dead (on the Day of Resurrection). Indeed He is Able to do all things”

Man also derives medicines from plants, the greatest of which are the black seed of which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said that it is a cure for every disease apart from death (narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5687); and honey, which is gathered from the nectar of flowers, of which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… wherein is healing for man…” [al-Nahl 16:69]. 
Animals are also food for people. 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And the cattle, He has created them for you; in them there is warmth (warm clothing), and numerous benefits, and of them you eat”
[al-Nahl 16:5] 
“And He it is Who has subjected the sea (to you), that you eat thereof fresh tender meat (i.e. fish), and that you bring forth out of it ornaments to wear.

From animals man makes the tents in which he lives and the clothes that he wears. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And Allaah has made for you in your homes an abode, and made for you out of the hides of the cattle (tents for) dwelling, which you find so light (and handy) when you travel and when you stay (in your travels); and of their wool, fur, and hair (sheep wool, camel fur, and goat hair), furnishings and articles of convenience (e.g. carpets, blankets), comfort for a while”

It seems to be the case that this share is a 
    kind of trade goods, because those who buy shares in land intend to trade them and make money. Hence they have to pay zakaah on them every year, 
    by calculating their value and then paying zakaah.  If he bought a share of thirty thousand, and after one year has passed this share is worth 
    sixty thousand, then he must pay zakaah on sixty thousand. If after one year has passed the thirty thousand is now worth only ten thousand, then 
    he only has to pay zakaah on ten thousand. Based on this, the questioner should pay the zakaah for each year that he did not pay zakaah. But if 
    these shares have not been sold until now, then if they are sold he should pay the zakaah. But no one should take this matter lightly, rather he 
    should sell them for whatever price he can get, and then pay the zakaah.","Majmoo’ Fataawa, 18/226"
