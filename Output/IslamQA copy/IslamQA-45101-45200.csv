    This hadeeth was narrated by al-Tirmidhi (2352) from Anas 
    (may Allaah be pleased with him), according to whom the Messenger of Allaah 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “O Allaah, cause me 
    to live poor and cause me to die poor, and gather me among the poor on the 
    Day of Resurrection.” Al-Tirmidhi said: This is a ghareeb hadeeth. 

    It was also narrated by Ibn Maajah (4126) from Abu Sa’eed 
    al-Khudri (may Allaah be pleased with him). 

    Many scholars classed it as da’eef. If we assume it is 
    saheeh, then what is meant by “poor” here is being humble before Allaah, not 
    having little wealth. 

    Ibn Katheer said in al-Bidaayah wa’l-Nihaayah (6/75): 

    With regard to the hadeeth narrated by Ibn Maajah from Abu 
    Sa’eed, that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said:  “O Allaah, cause me to live poor …”, it is a da’eef 
    hadeeth, and it not proven from its isnaad, because it includes Yazeed ibn 
    Sinaan Abu Farwah al-Rahaawi, who is very weak (da’eef jiddan). And Allaah 
    know best. 

    It was also narrated by al-Tirmidhi with another isnaad from 
    Anas … then he said: This is a ghareeb hadeeth. 

    I (Ibn Katheer) say: there is some weakness in its isnaad, 
    and there is something objectionable in its text. And Allaah knows best. End 
    quote. 

    Al-Haafiz said in al-Talkhees (3/109), after quoting 
    this hadeeth: 

    It was narrated and classed as ghareeb by al-Tirmidhi, and 
    its isnaad is da’eef. A similar hadeeth was narrated from Abu Sa’eed by Ibn 
    Maajah, but there is also some weakness in its isnaad. There is another 
    isnaad in al-Mustadrak, from ‘Ata’, and it was narrated by al-Bayhaqi 
    from ‘Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit. End quote. 

    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah be pleased with him) 
    was asked about this hadeeth and he said: 

    This is narrated, but it is da’eef and is not proven. Its 
    meaning is: cause me to live with humility, but the wording is not proven. 
    End quote from Majmoo’ al-Fataawa (18/357). 

    He also said (18/326): 

    This hadeeth was narrated by al-Tirmidhi, and it was 
    mentioned by Abu’l-Faraj (Ibn al-Jawzi) in al-Mawdoo’aat. Whether its 
    wording is saheeh or not, the poor person who is praised is the one who is 
    humble before Allaah, it does not mean the poor person who has no wealth. 
    Rather a man may be poor and lacking wealth but he may be a tyrant. As the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said in a saheeh 
    hadeeth: “There are three to whom Allaah will not speak or look at on the 
    Day of Resurrection, nor will He praise them and theirs will be a painful 
    torment: a king who tells lies, a poor man who is arrogant and an old man 
    who commits zina.” And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “I am a slave; I eat as a slave eats and I sit as a slave 
    sits.” Being “poor” is an attitude, and it means being humble, as ‘Eesa ibn 
    Maryam (peace be upon him) said: ‘And dutiful to my 
    mother, and made me not arrogant, unblest’ [Maryam 19:32]. 
     

    In Lisaan al-‘Arab it says (13/216): 

    The original meaning of miskeen in Arabic is humble, 
    and the original meaning of faqeer is needy. 

    Hence the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said: “O Allaah, cause me to live poor (miskeen)” meaning 
    thereby humble, not one of the arrogant and proud, i.e., humble and 
    submissive before You, O Lord, not arrogant. The word miskeen here 
    does not mean poor in the sense of being in need. End quote. 

    In al-Talkhees (3/109), al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar quoted 
    al-Bayhaqi as saying of this hadeeth: In my view it does not mean that he 
    was asking for poverty in the sense of having little, rather he was asking 
    for humility. End quote.

45148,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45148,Is it permissible to curse those who commit sin?,"Among us, if one man curses another and the curse receives no response because he does not deserve that, does it come back on the first man or not? Is it permissible to curse a woman on the grounds that she is not wearing hijab?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Cursing is not one of the attributes of the believer who has 
    attained perfect faith. It was narrated by Imam Ahmad in his Musnad 
    and Imam al-Tirmidhi in his Jaami’ from ‘Alqamah that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn 
    Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The believer is not a 
    slanderer, one who curses a great deal, one who indulges in obscenity or who 
    in engages in foul talk.” Al-Tirmidhi said: It is a hasan ghareeb hadeeth. 
    And it was narrated in al-Saheehayn from Thaabit ibn al-Dahhaak that 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Cursing 
    a believer is like killing him.” 

    Based on this, it is not permissible for a believer to curse 
    anyone among his Muslim brothers except those whom Allaah cursed in His Book 
    or whom the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    cursed. It is not permissible to curse one who commits a sin because of his 
    or her sin, such as a woman who is not wearing hijab and the like. Rather 
    the Muslim should advise her and encourage her to wear hijab using kind and 
    gentle methods. If anyone curses someone who does not deserve to be cursed, 
    there is a stern warning that the curse will come back on the one who utters 
    it if it is not justified. This is indicated by the report narrated by 
    Abu’l-Darda’ (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When a person 
    curses something, the curse ascends to heaven, and the gates of heaven are 
    closed to it. Then it comes back down to earth and the gates of earth are 
    closed to it. Then it looks right and left, and if it does not find anywhere 
    to go, it goes to the one who was cursed, and if he deserves it (it befalls 
    him), otherwise it goes back to the one who uttered it.” Narrated by Abu 
    Dawood in his Sunan.  

    And Allaah is the Source of strength. May Allaah send 
    blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.

    There is no reason why a hermaphrodite animal should not be 
    sacrificed, unless that affects the quality of the meat. 

    The Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) described the faults which make an animal unacceptable for sacrifice. 
    They are: obvious one-eyedness, obvious sickness, obvious lameness and 
    extreme weakness. 

    By analogy, this includes faults that are similar to these or 
    worse, such as blindness, a limp or having a leg cut off. This has been 
    explained in the answer to question no.

    Is seems that a hermaphrodite does not have any of these

 What is the ruling on selling such tapes, knowing that they have helped many to become committed Muslims?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.One of the good 
    characteristics of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah is that they know the right 
    path and show compassion towards people, so they love to speak with 
    knowledge and fairness, and they hate wrongdoing and ignorance, because they 
    follow the Book of Allaah whenever He commands them to treat people with 
    fairness and to judge them on the basis of knowledge and truth.  
Allaah says (interpretation 
    of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Stand 
    out firmly for justice, as witnesses to Allaah, even though it be against 
    yourselves, or your parents, or your kin”
[al-Nisa’ 4:135] 
“…and that when you judge 
    between men, you judge with justice”
[al-Nisa’ 4:58] 
“And whenever you give 
    your word (i.e. judge between men or give evidence), say the truth”
[al-An’aam 6:152]
The human soul can only 
    reach this level when it works for the sake of Allaah free from any ego or 
    worldly interests, and when it is aware that Allaah can see into the depths 
    of the conscience and what is hidden in the heart. According to the hadeeth: 
    “Those who are fair and just will be on thrones of light.” Narrated by 
    Muslim, 2827. 
One of the du’aa’s of the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was: “I ask You to 
    (make me speak) the word of truth at times of anger and at times of 
    contentment.” Narrated by al-Nasaa’i, 1305; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani 
    in Saheeh al-Nasaa’i.
 If you think about the 
    divinely-ordained method by means of which Allaah raised people to the 
    pinnacle of self-control, tolerance and speaking the word of truth even if 
    it goes against one’s self, one’s parents or one’s relatives, you will 
    understand that many of the daa’iyahs who are involved in the field of 
    contemporary Islamic da’wah, who have some good qualities and a great deal 
    of influences among the masses, are doing well in the aspects in which they 
    excel, and in the aspects in which they are falling short they are either 
    striving to reach the right conclusion by means of their own ijtihaad, in 
    which case they will receive either one reward or two, or they are falling 
    short in some aspects but we hope, in sha Allaah, that their good deeds will 
    make up for their bad deeds, especially in the case of those who have 
    influenced the people and led to them becoming righteous. Depriving the 
    people of access to their call, when there is no effective alternative, is a 
    method that is not approved of in Islam, for one of the basic principles of 
    sharee’ah is to reduce evils and promote good among the people. 
The good that is achieved by 
    these daa’iyahs, such as guiding the youth, encouraging girls to observe 
    hijab and encouraging people to pray regularly are important matters that 
    are among the greatest aims of sharee’ah. 
The shortcomings that you 
    mention, meaning that some daa’iyahs fall short in some aspects, should not 
    be allowed to overshadow the benefits mentioned, especially since they have 
    to do with minor issues and are limited to the individual, whereas the 
    benefits are great and reach many people. 
Hence there is no reason why 
    you should not sell tapes by these daa’iyahs, so long as they are following 
    the way of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah. If any of them make a mistake with 
    regard to some matter, the way of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah is to advise 
    them by getting in touch with them or writing to them. 
Whoever thinks about the 
    daa’iyahs who deliver khutbahs and lectures or broadcast on TV and radio 
    etc, will notice that they are of different types: 
Some of them are following 
    the path of the salaf in their methodology, moderation and action.  We 
    should listen to these daa’iyahs and encourage people to listen to them. 
Some of them are correct in 
    most of what they say, but they fall somewhat short in the field of action. 
    They should be listened to, because their shortcomings are usually limited 
    only to themselves. 
Some of them mix right and 
    wrong but in general they follow the Sunnah and do not adopt any ideas of 
    bid’ah (innovation) and do not promote it, so we should not put people off 
    from listening to them altogether, rather we should correct their mistakes 
    and speak about their errors in a just and fair manner, whilst also praising 
    their good points. 
Some of them are people of 
    bid’ah and shirk, which they spread and promote. We should not listen to 
    them and we should warn others against them, and not praise their good 
    points, because that means we are praising them when they have committed 
    major sins which cancel out any good deeds. 
The above has to do with the 
    daa’iyahs. 
On the other hand, there are 
    people who speak of the daa’iyahs in a just manner, and others who speak of 
    them in an unfair manner. 
Among the latter there are 
    some who are unjust and unfair; they accuse some daa’iyahs of bid’ah when in 
    fact they do not follow bid’ah, and warn others against them, when it is 
    more appropriate to warn people against these unfair critics, because they 
    are unfair and wrongdoers. No attention should be paid to their warnings 
    because of their unfairness and wrongdoing. 
Hence we must know how to 
    distinguish between sin, bid’ah, error and mistakes with regard to the basic 
    tenets of ‘aqeedah. 
We will give some examples: 
If there is a daa’iyah who 
    calls people to the path of the salaf, but he is extreme and harsh, then he 
    should be praised for his methodology but he should be given advice with 
    regard to his harshness. 
If there is a preacher who 
    quotes da’eef and munkar (weak and unsound) ahaadeeth, but there is also a 
    lot of truth in what he says, then he should be praised for his preaching, 
    but he should be told of the error of his quoting weak and fabricated 
    ahaadeeth and taking them as evidence. 
If there is someone who 
    reminds the people and teaches them about proper morals, etiquette and 
    virtues, but he shaves his beard, for example, or sits in mixed gatherings, 
    then he should be praised for his good qualities but should be told of the 
    rulings regarding the matters where he goes against the Sunnah. If he calls 
    for abandoning some of the obligatory or mustahabb Sunnahs, then that view 
    should also be refuted. 
If there is someone who 
    teaches the people bid’ah (innovations) and encourages them to associate 
    others with Allaah, such as seeking the help of the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him), dead “saints” (awliya’) or occupants of 
    graves, or encourages them to pray to them and ask of them, then we should 
    warn others against him and explain the falseness of his belief and shirk. 
    We should tell the people not to listen to anything that he says because it 
    involves dangerous and harmful ideas. 
If there is someone who 
    mixes truth and falsehood, Sunnah and bid’ah, we should not encourage the 
    people to listen to him; rather we should point out the error of his ways. 
    When he starts to propagate his wrong ideas, then the should be advised and 
    requested to retract these ideas publicly. If he does not do that, then his 
    mistakes should be announced in the same gathering where he promoted his 
    mistaken ideas.

Types of anger


Types of anger according to Ibn Al-Qayyim


Words of advice for Muslim couples","Praise be to Allah.Is divorce in anger valid?
Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about a man whose wife treats him badly and insults him, so he divorced her at a moment of anger . 
He replied: 
“If you uttered the words of divorce at a moment of intense anger and without realising it, and you could not control yourself, because of her bad words and insults etc., and you did that at a moment of intense anger and without realising it, and she acknowledges that, or you have a witness of good character, then divorce has not taken place. The Shar`i evidence indicates that divorce does not take place if the words are spoken at a moment of intense anger – and if it is accompanied by not realising what is happening then the ruling applies even more so. 
For example, Ahmad, Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah narrated from `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no divorce and no manumission in the event of Ighlaq.” 
The majority of scholars said that Ighlaq means compulsion or anger, i.e., intense anger . His anger made him unaware of what he was saying, so he is like one who is unconscious, insane or drunk, because of the intensity of his anger . 
So divorce does not take place in this instance. If he does not realise what he is doing and cannot control his words or actions because of the intensity of his anger, then divorce does not take place. 
Types of anger
Anger may be of three types: 
1.     When a person is angry and is no longer aware of what he is doing. This is likened to the insane, so divorce does not take place according to all scholars. 
2.     Where a person is very angry but is still aware of what is going on, but his anger is so intense that it makes him say the words of divorce. In this case too, divorce does not take place according to the correct scholarly opinion. 
3.     The ordinary type of anger which is not very intense. In this case, divorce takes place , according to all the scholars.” (Fatawa At-Talaq, pp. 19-21, compiled by Dr. `Abdullah At-Tayyar and Muhammad Al-Musa) 
What the Shaykh mentioned about the second type of anger is also the view favoured by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and his student Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on them both). 
Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) wrote an essay on that entitled Ighathat Al-Lahfan fi Hukm Talaq Al-Ghadban, in which he said the following: 
Types of anger according to Ibn Al-Qayyim
Anger is of three types: 
1.     That which is not so intense as to affect a person’s mind or rational thinking; he knows what he is saying and what he means. There is no dispute that in this case divorce, manumission and contracts are valid. 
2.     Where his anger reaches such a limit that he no longer knows what he is doing or saying. There is no dispute that in this situation divorce does not take place. If his anger is so intense that he does not know what he is saying, there is no doubt that none of his words should be implemented in this case. The words of the Mukallif (adult of sound mind) are only to be implemented if he knows what he is saying and what it means, and if the speaker really means that. 
3.     The kind of anger that falls between the two categories mentioned above, where the anger goes beyond the ordinary level but not so far as to make him behave like a madman. This is an area of scholarly differences of opinion. The Shar`i evidence indicates that divorce, manumission and contracts in such cases are not valid, and this is a kind of Ighlaq as the Imams explained. (From Matalib Uli an-Nuha, 5/323; see also Zad Al-Ma’ad, 5/215) 
Words of advice for Muslim couples
The husband has to fear Allah and avoid using the word of divorce so that this will not lead to the disintegration of his family. 
We advise husband and wife alike to fear Allah and heed His limits, and to look at what the husband said to his wife in a fair manner: is this the ordinary kind of anger, which is the only case in which divorce can take place, and this is the third type in which divorce does take place according to scholarly consensus. 
They should be cautious and not transgress the limits of their religion, and they should not let the fact that they have children make them describe the husband’s anger at the time he spoke the words of divorce to the Mufti as intense so as to get the Fatwa they want, even though both parties know that this was not the case.   
Based on this, the fact that the couple have children together should motivate them to avoid using the words of divorce recklessly; it should not cause them to try to find a loophole in the Shar`i rulings after divorce has taken place and look for a way out or seek concessions from the jurists with regard to that. 
We ask Allah to bless us all with understanding of His religion and help us to venerate His laws.

Is it permissible for the doctor to prescribe this medicine for her or should she refuse?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    It is haram for her to use contraceptives without her 
    husband’s consent, because it is the right of both husband and wife to have 
    children. Hence the scholars said that it is haram for the husband to 
    withdraw from his wife without his wife’s consent. 

    “Withdraw” here refers to ejaculating outside the vagina 
    (‘azl) lest the woman become pregnant. But if both spouses agree to taking 
    these pills, it is permissible, because that is akin to ‘azl, which was 
    practised by the Sahabah, as Jabir (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: 
    We used to practise ‘azl at the time when the Quran was being revealed. 

    In other words, if it had been forbidden the Quran would 
    have forbidden it. However, it is better not to take these pills because 
    that goes against the wishes of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allah be upon him) for this ummah, that they should have many children. 

    I tell you that the ones who first invented these pills were 
    the Jews and other enemies of the Muslims, who want to eradicate this ummah 
    and reduce its numbers, and leave it dependent upon others, because the 
    smaller their numbers the smaller their productivity, and the greater their 
    numbers the greater their productivity – in agriculture, industry, commerce 
    and in every field. Nations are feared more than others if they are greater 
    in number, even if they are not advanced in industry, because large numbers 
    alarm the enemy.  

    So we call upon the Muslims to have many children, so long as 
    there are no circumstances such as sickness or poor health on the woman’s 
    part or she cannot give birth without surgical intervention, because these 
    are cases of necessity and cases of necessity are subject to different 
    rulings.

45185,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45185,Spending zakah,"A charity gives zakah to its employees and students in instalments. 
The charity for Quran memorization has some zakah money which it has collected from its supporters, and the charity usually gives this zakah to those who are entitled to it among those who attend their halaqahs, paying it in instalments in two months of every year. 
Some employees of the charity are also in financial difficulty and their salaries are not enough for their family’s basic needs, and some of them have commitments and debts, so the charity occasionally gives them money from the zakah and tells them that this is zakah. Because these people are going through a hard time, the charity decided to give a fixed amount of zakah each month to employees who are entitled to it, giving between 1500 and 2000 riyals. Is it permissible to give zakah money each month on a regular basis to members of the charity who are entitled to it?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
There is nothing wrong with the charity distributing zakah to those who are entitled to it, acting on behalf of those who have given it and those who are in charge of it, and they will be rewarded in sha Allah. 
Secondly: 
It is permissible to give zakah to employees of the charity and students in the halaqahs if they are among those who are entitled to zakah, such as if they are poor or needy, and they do not have enough to live on, or if they are in debt and cannot afford to pay off their debts, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“As-Sadaqaat (here it means zakah) are only for the Fuqaraa’ (poor), and Al‑Masaakeen the poor) and those employed to collect (the funds); and to attract the hearts of those who have been inclined (towards Islam); and to free the captives; and for those in debt; and for Allah’s Cause (i.e. for Mujaahidoon — those fighting in a holy battle), and for the wayfarer (a traveller who is cut off from everything); a duty imposed by Allah. And Allah is All-Knower, All-Wise” [Al-Tawbah 9:60]
Thirdly: 
It is not permissible to delay giving zakah, unless there is a greater interest to be served, but the delay should be brief and should be for a reason such as there being no one who deserves it or the money is not available to be paid as zakah, or to wait for some relative and the like. 
Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If he delays it – i.e., zakah, in order to give it to a relative who is more entitled to it or to one who is in great need, if it is delayed for a short time, there is nothing wrong with that, but if it is for a long time, that is not permissible.""(Al-Mughni  2/290). 
The Standing Committee was asked about a charity that collects zakah from the rich then delays giving it for almost a year, on the grounds that they are giving help in Rabee’ and in Ramadaan, and so on. What is the ruling on this delay, as the owners of the wealth have done what is required of them and have asked us to take on the responsibility? 
They replied: The charity must distribute the zakah to those who are entitled to it, and not delay it if there are people who are entitled to it. ""(Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah 9/402). 
Based on this, giving zakah in the form of monthly instalments is delaying it from the time when it must be paid, and that is not permissible. 
If there is a need to give the zakah to the poor in instalments, there is nothing wrong with that, but that is subject to the condition that the zakah should have been paid in advance, i.e., the one who paid it must have paid it before the year was over, in which case it there is nothing wrong with paying it in instalments, so long as it is not given any later than the end of the year. 
This means that the charity needs to convince the givers of zakah to give their zakah in advance, so that they can prepare to distribute it on a monthly basis in a manner that is in the best interests of the poor and needy. 
The way in which it may be paid in advance is: if his zakah becomes due at the beginning of Safar, for example, when he pays his zakah on time, he can pay his zakah for the coming year as well, so he will have paid his zakah one year in advance. If we assume that his zakah for the coming year is one thousand, then he can pay one thousand in advance for the year, or he may pay it in instalments throughout the year, as he sees fit. Then when the next year ends, he will have paid his zakah and will not have delayed any of it. 
Ibn Qudaamah said: Ahmad said: It is not right for him pay his zakah in instalments on a monthly basis, meaning he should not delay paying it in order to pay it in instalments, giving a little bit every month. But if he gives it in advance to them or to others, in instalments or all at once, that is permissible, because he is not delaying it from the time when it is due.""(Al-Mughni  2/290). 
The Standing Committee was asked: Is it permissible for me to pay my zakah a year in advance, in the form of regular monthly payments to poor families? 
They replied: There is nothing wrong with paying zakah one or two years in advance, if interests dictate that, or giving it on a monthly basis to the poor who are entitled to it.""(Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah  9/422) 
See also question no. 52852 
To sum up: it is not permissible for this charity to give the zakah that it has been delegated to give in monthly instalments, unless they know that the one who gave the zakah gave it in advance. They may encourage people to give zakah in advance, so that they may give the poor help every month or every three months, and so on. 
Fourthly: 
If a person takes zakah because he is in need, such as the poor and needy and debtors, then at the time of giving his situation must be determined: is he entitled to zakah or not? He may be poor now, then Allah makes him independent of means by His bounty, so it is no longer permissible to give him zakah. We must be careful about this so that zakah will be given to those prescribed in sharee’ah. 
We ask Allah to give to those who take care of charities the best of rewards, and to help them and guide them, and enable them to do all that is good.

Is it haram to dye your hair red or yellow?


General principle regarding adornment and beautification in Islam


Did Prophet Muhammad dye his hair?


Can you dye your hair when there is no grey hair?","Praise be to Allah.Is it haram to dye your hair?
It is permissible to dye hair any colour apart from black, and there is no differentiation in this regard between old men and young men. There is nothing wrong with dyeing the hair before grey hairs appear. It says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah (5/168): 
“Question: I saw some people using something to change the colour of their hair, making it black or red, and I saw them using something else to make curly hair straight. Is it permissible to do any of these things? Is the ruling the same for young men and old men? 
Answer: Praise be to Allah and blessings and peace be upon His Messenger and his family and Companions. There is nothing wrong with changing the hair colour to anything except black, or using something to straighten curly hair, and the ruling is the same for old men and young men, so long as harmful substances are avoided and the material used is pure and permissible. But changing the hair to pure black is not permitted, for men or for women, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Change this grey hair, but avoid black.” 
And Allah is the Source of strength. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and Companions.” (The hadith quoted was narrated by Muslim, 2102) 
Another thing which indicates that it is not allowed to dye the hair black is the hadith narrated by Abu Dawud (4212) from Ibn 'Abbas who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There will be people at the end of time who will dye their hair black like the crops of birds; they will never smell the fragrance of Paradise.” This hadith was classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud. 
Is it haram to dye your hair red or yellow?
The fact that it is permissible to dye the hair red and yellow was narrated by Abu Dawud (4211) from Ibn 'Abbas who said: A man who had dyed his hair with henna passed by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and he said: “How handsome this is.” Then another who had dyed his hair with henna and katam passed by and he said, “This is more handsome.” Then another who had dyed his hair yellow passed by and he said: “This one is more handsome than all the others.” The comments in this hadith had to do with changing grey hairs to another colour, not to dyeing the hair in all cases even if it is not grey. 
Al-Albani said concerning this hadith in Mishkat al-Masabih: it is jayyid (good). 
General principle regarding adornment and beautification in Islam
We should also note the general principle with regard to matters of adornment and beautification, which is that it is not allowed to do anything that involves forbidden kinds of imitation, such as imitation of the disbelievers or of immoral people, which is haram because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.” Narrated by Abu Dawud, 4031; classed as sahih by al-Albani. 
Hence before ruling that a particular kind of dye that is asked about is permissible, we must make sure that it is not an imitation of the disbelievers or immoral people, or one of the singers or actors whom young people regard as examples to be followed.  
It is also not allowed to dye the hair in a manner that is regarded as effeminate or an imitation of women, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade such imitation and cursed those who do it. (Al-Bukhari, 5435) 
Did Prophet Muhammad dye his hair?
With regard to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) dyeing his hair, there is some difference of opinion as to whether he dyed his hair or not. Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The Companions differed as to whether he dyed his hair.  Anas said: He did not dye his hair. Abu Hurayrah said: he did dye his hair. Hammad ibn Salamah narrated from Humayd that Anas said: I saw the hair of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) dyed. Hammad said: And ‘Abd-Allah ibn Muhammad ibn ‘Aqil told me: I saw a few hairs of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the possession of Anas ibn Malik that were dyed. 
A group (of scholars) said that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to use a great deal of perfume, and his hair had become red from that, so people thought that he had dyed it but he had not. Abu Rithmah said: I came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) with a son of mine, and he said: “Is this your son?” I said, “Yes, I bear witness to that.” He said: “He is not responsible for your sins and you are not responsible for his sins.” He said: And I saw grey hair that had been dyed red. Al-Tirmidhi said: This is the best and clearest report that has been narrated concerning this, because the sahih reports state that the Prophet did not turn grey. Hammad ibn Salamah narrated from Sammak ibn Harb that it was said to Jabir ibn Samurah: “Was there any grey hair on the head of the Prophet?” He said: “There was no grey hair on his head except a few hairs at the parting, and when he put on perfume, its colour covered them.” (From Zad al-Ma’ad, 1/169)
Can you dye your hair when there is no grey hair? 
With regard to thinking of following the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in dyeing the hair when there is no grey hair , I know that there is a strong difference of opinion as to whether the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did in fact dye his hair or not. 
Moreover, dyeing the hair as enjoined in the Sunnah is not something that is done for its own sake, rather it is done to change grey hair, and to be different from the Jews and Christians, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Change grey hairs and do not be like the Jews.” Narrated by al-Nasai, 4986; al-Tirmidhi, 1674. 
It was narrated by Muslim (3924) that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw grey hair on the head of Abu Bakr’s father, he said: “Change this with something.” According to al-Bukhari (5448) he said: “The Jews do not dye their hair, so be different from them.” 
Based on this, dyeing the hair when there is no grey hair is not Sunnah and is not regarded as following the Prophet’s (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) example, because there is no reason to do that, and it does not serve the same shar’i interests as are achieved by dyeing grey hair. 
The most that we can say is that it is permissible so long as it does not involve imitating the kuffar or cause any harm to one's health, in which case it is haram. And Allah knows best.
