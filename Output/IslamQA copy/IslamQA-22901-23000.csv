He is the one who is taking care of this waqf, but he did not dispose of its income last year. He is asking about the ruling on this waqf, and if it is said that it is not permissible, what should be done with the income of the waqf each year?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    We say to the one who is looking after the waqf: buy meat 
    with the income generated by the waqf and distribute it to the poor. Do not 
    do this only in the month of Rajab; rather do it in any month, because if a 
    waqf includes something that is wrong, it should be put into practice 
    without that wrong thing. What is wrong here in this case is singling out 
    the month of Rajab for slaughtering the meat. This is to be avoided, and the 
    meat should be slaughtered in any month and distributed to the poor as 
    stated in the waqf. And Allaah knows best.",Shaykh Khaalid al-Sabt
22905,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22905,Benefitting from a house that was built with an interest-based loan,"3 years ago we bought a house with a morgage with interests [riba] after we heard a fatwa.now we finished paying it [we payed a big part of it cash ] my questions are ;-
1- is it halal for us to live in this house.
2- can we rent it.
3- can we use it as a work place . [business,work from home].",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
You have to repent to Allah for this interest-based loan, because interest (riba) is one of the worst of major sins. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Fear Allah and give up what remains (due to you) from Riba (from now onward) if you are (really) believers.
And if you do not do it, then take a notice of war from Allah and His Messenger but if you repent, you shall have your capital sums. Deal not unjustly (by asking more than your capital sums), and you shall not be dealt with unjustly (by receiving less than your capital sums)” [al-Baqarah 2:278-279]
Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Tafseer (2/657): 
“This is a stern warning and a threat to those who persist in dealing in riba after having been warned. Ibn Jurayj said: Ibn ‘Abbaas said: ‘Take a notice of war’ means, be certain of war from Allah and His Messenger… and it was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas said: It will be said on the Day of Resurrection to the one who consumed riba: ‘Take up your weapon for war.’ Then he recited (interpretation of the meaning): 
‘And if you do not do it, then take a notice of war from Allah and His Messenger’ [al-Baqarah 2:279].” 
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed the one who consumes riba, the one who pays it, the one who records it and the two who witness it, and he said: “They are all the same.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1598). 
With regard to living in this house, if you have repented to Allah then there is nothing wrong with you living in it or renting it out or using it as a place of business. 
The Standing Committee was asked about a man who took out an interest-based loan and built a house: should he knock down the house, or what should he do? 
They replied: 
If the situation is as you say, then what you have done by taking out this loan in this manner is haraam because it is riba. You have to repent and seek forgiveness for that, and regret what you have done, and resolve not to do such a thing again. With regard to the house that you built, do not knock it down, rather make use of it by living in it etc, and we hope that Allah will forgive you for your careless action.

    lottery is a form of gambling, both of which Allaah has forbidden, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Intoxicants (all kinds 
    of alcoholic drinks), and gambling, and Al‑Ansaab (stone altars for sacrifices to idols etc), and Al‑Azlaam (arrows for seeking luck or decision) 
    are an abomination of Shaytaan’s (Satan’s) handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) in order that you may be successful”
[al-Maa'idah 5:90-91]
The ruling on lotteries has been explained 
    previously. See Question no. 6476 
Based on this, it is not permissible to sell 
    beer and lottery tickets, because this is a kind of cooperating in sin and transgression, and Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Help you one another in Al‑Birr and At‑Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not 
    help one another in sin and transgression”

So you have to give up this work immediately. 
    The believer should realize that whoever gives up something for the sake of Allaah, Allaah will compensate him with something better than that. If 
    a person puts his trust in his Lord, He will grant him the means of provision, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his 
    duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty).
And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in 
    Allaah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allaah will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allaah has set a measure for all things”

22909,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22909,How to Make Intention for Ramadan Fasting,How should a person form his intention to fast Ramadan? When should he have the intention to fast?,"If you have the intention of fasting on the first day of Ramadan that you will fast the whole month, that intention is enough to cover the whole month.",,"Praise be to Allah.“The intention (niyyah) means resolving to fast. It is essential to have the intention the night before, night by night, in Ramadan .” (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, vol. 10, p. 246) 
“Some scholars were of the view that in the case of a repeated act of worship, it is sufficient to form the intention once the first time one does, unless the sequence of repetition is interrupted, in which case a new intention must be formed. On this basis, if a person has the intention of fasting on the first day of Ramadan that he will fast this whole month, that is enough to cover the whole month, so long as he does not have an excuse to break his fast and thus break this continuity, such as traveling during Ramadan . In that case, when he wants to resume fasting he must form the intention of fasting again. 
This is the more correct opinion, because all the Muslims, if you ask them, will say that they intend to fast the whole month from beginning to end. So even if the intention is not formed literally, it is there by implication, because the basic principle is that it does not stop. Hence we say that if the continuity is broken for some permissible reason, then one starts fasting again, the intention must be renewed. This is the view which brings peace of mind.”

22912,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22912,He committed a sin and does not know what he should do now,A person who has commited sin[who knew he is commiting sin -at the time]....now that same person feels such guilt that cant be expressed. What should this person do?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.The Muslim does not have to tell anyone of 
    his sin, rather it is not recommended that he should do that. He should conceal his sin and not expose it. The Muslim should feel disturbed about 
    his sin so that he will be motivated to repent sincerely. It is not sufficient for the Muslim to recognize that he has committed a sin, rather he 
    should remember that Allaah is always watching, so that he will not do it at all. If the Shaytaan makes him fall into one of his traps, he must 
    regret committing this sin and he has to give it up and resolve not to return to it. 
In this way the Muslim will have done what 
    Allaah requires of him, namely sincere repentance. The Muslim must not despair of the mercy of Allaah or think that He is unlikely to forgive his 
    sin or guide him to repentance. For the Shaytaan is eager to make the Muslim fall into sin and then he is eager to close the doors of repentance 
    in his face. 
After he repents sincerely, the Muslim 
    becomes better than he was before he committed this sin. Sincere repentance may alert him to things that he was careless about, so he gives up bad 
    companions who help him to commit sin, and he stops travelling to immoral countries where he committed sin, and he stops watching and listening to 
    things that Allaah has forbidden, namely singing, musical instruments and movies. 
Perhaps he has been careless about these 
    matters but the sincere repentance that Allaah has enjoined awakens him to that. 
The Muslim may forget that Allaah is always 
    watching before he commits the sin, because if he was aware of that he would not have done it. But if he had forgotten, then he should try to 
    remember whilst he is committing the sin that Allaah can see him, and that the noble angels can see him, and that Allaah may decree that he should 
    die whilst he is committing this sin – so how would he meet his Lord in the Hereafter? 
If the Shaytaan manages to ensnare the Muslim 
    before and during the sin, then let him remember afterwards that Allaah stretches forth His hand at night to accept the repentance of those who 
    sinned during the day, and He stretches forth His hand during the day to accept the repentance of those who sinned at night, and that Allaah 
    rejoices over the repentance of His slave even though He is the one Who guided him to repent and made it easy for him, and He has no need of the 
    repentance of this person. 
The Muslim must fear Allaah his Lord and 
    regret what he has done; he must also resolve not to return to it and to do a lot of acts of worship. He must change his environment and friends, 
    looking for something better. It is not permissible for him to mention his sin to anyone, and he should make his repentance sincerely for the sake 
    of Allaah alone. He should also be eager to pray in congregation in the mosque and attend study circles. 
We ask Allaah to help us to do that which He 
    loves and which pleases Him, and to make it easy for us to do good.

If he uses an aerosol and nothing from it reaches his throat, then that is o.k. But it should be noted that the smell that comes from the fasting person’s mouth as a result of the fast is not something to be disliked, because it is the effect of obedience to Allaah. In the hadeeth it says that “the smell from the fasting person’s mouth is better in the sight of Allaah than the fragrance of musk.”","Al-Muntaqa min Fataawa Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan, vol. 3, p. 121"

Is it permissible for me to do this research for the student in return for payment that I take from him?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Doing research that is required by teachers in government 
    schools or elsewhere is a requirement of study that serves specific goals 
    such as training the student to research, acquainting them with the sources, 
    finding out how able he is to derive information and organize it, and other 
    aims of asking the student to do research. Hence if some teachers or others 
    do this work on the student’s behalf in return for payment or without 
    payment, this is a haraam action, and the payment for it is haraam earnings, 
    because it involves deceit, lying and falsification. This is a kind of 
    cooperating in sin, and Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “but do not help one another in sin and transgression”

    [al-Maa'idah 5:2]
And the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever deceives us is 
    not one of us.” Narrated by Muslim, 101 

    To sum up: it is not permissible for a student to delegate 
    someone to do research on his behalf, and it is not permissible for anyone 
    to do it on his behalf in secret, or to take payment for that.

Benefits of lowering the gaze","Praise be to Allah.We appreciate your confidence in us, and we ask Allah to make us and you steadfast, and to show us the truth as truth and help us to follow it, and to show us falsehood as false and help us to avoid it, and not let it confuse us and lead us astray. 
My brother in Islam, we can sense from your words that you are very distressed, and that you feel that you are doing wrong. In sha Allah, this is a sign of sincerity, and the beginning of repentance, by Allah’s Leave. 
Each one among us needs to re-examine his situation and sincerely resolve to start to strive against his own self which enjoins him to do evil, and to arm himself with certain weapons in this struggle. 
Useful tips on how to quit sins
We will give you some advice through which we ask Allah to benefit us and you: 

Pray to Allah and beseech Him, and know that Allah does not let down the one who calls upon Him. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“And your Lord said: ‘Invoke Me [i.e. believe in My Oneness (Islamic Monotheism) and ask Me for anything] I will respond to your (invocation). Verily, those who scorn My worship [i.e. do not invoke Me, and do not believe in My Oneness, (Islamic Monotheism)] they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!’” [Ghafir 40:60] 
Persist in calling upon Allah and making du’a to Him, and seek the times when du’a is most likely to be answered, in sujud, after praying, in the last hour of the day on Friday, and in the last third of the night when our Lord comes down to the lowest heaven and says. “Where is the one who calls upon Me, that I may answer him, where is the one who seeks My forgiveness, that I may forgive him? You should not feel that there is no response, for Allah is always near and responds to the call of the one who is distressed if he calls upon Him, and He relieves him of his distress.  

Each person must strive to do more acts of worship. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“Verily, the good deeds remove the evil deeds.” [Hud 11:114]
And he should focus on prayer in particular. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, As-Salah (the prayer) prevents from Al-Fahsha (i.e. great sins of every kind, unlawful sexual intercourse) and Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism, and every kind of evil wicked deed).” [al-'Ankabut 29:45]

Each person must strive to increase his knowledge of Allah, by studying His names and attributes, and by thinking of the creation of the heavens and the earth. Then he will feel shy before Allah. As one of the salaf said: Do not look at the smallness of the sin, rather look at the greatness of the One Whom you have disobeyed. 


You should know that the way to Paradise is difficult and needs effort and patience. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“As for those who strive hard in Us (Our Cause), We will surely guide them to Our paths (i.e. Allah’s religion — Islamic Monotheism). And verily, Allah is with the Muhsinun (good-doers).” [al-'Ankabut 29:69]

Think about the benefits of lowering your gaze , and this will motivate you to quit looking at pornographic pictures and  will enable you to ignore the evil ideas that cross your mind and the whispers of the Shaytan. 

Benefits of lowering the gaze
There follow some of its benefits , which we list for you in the hope that Allah may benefit us and you thereby: 

Lowering the gaze is obedience to the command of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): “Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things)” [al-Nur 24:30], and obeying the command of Allah brings ultimate happiness to a person in this world and in the Hereafter.
It purifies the heart and soul and actions.
It prevents the poisoned arrows from reaching you, for a look is one of the poisoned arrows of Iblis.
The one who lowers his gaze is compensated with the sweetness of faith in his heart.
He gains sound insight through which he can distinguish truth from falsehood.
He will rid his heart of the pain of feeling that one is missing out, for whoever looks without restraining his glance will always feel that he is missing out.
His heart will be filled with happiness, joy and light that is greater than any pleasure that may be gained by looking.
His will free his heart of the control of desire, for the one who is controlled by his whims and desires is indeed a prisoner.
Lowering the gaze strengthens the mind and increases wisdom, whereas letting the gaze wander freely only makes one foolish and heedless of consequences

We ask Allah to protect us and you from being led astray, and to enable us and you to do righteous deeds. May Allah send blessings upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon all his family and Companions.

Shaykh Ibn Jibreen was asked about the ruling 
    on car insurance; he replied:  
In my opinion insurance is a kind of ambiguity, because the company may take money from some 
    of its clients each year and those clients do not make any claims for repairs etc. And they may take a little from some other clients and lose a 
    great deal. There are some people who deal with cars who have little faith and do not fear Allaah, and when their cars are insured they do not 
    care what happens, so they expose themselves to danger and drive recklessly, so they may cause accidents and kill believing souls and destroy 
    wealth that is protected in sharee’ah, and they do not care about that because they know that the insurance company will bear the resulting costs. 
    I say that this insurance is not permissible because of these reasons and others, whether that is car insurance, life insurance, property 
    insurance etc. 
Fataawa Islamiyyah,

If this is the ruling on insurance, then 
    buying shares in these companies is haraam.

It is not permissible to buy shares in 
    commercial insurance companies, because insurance policies include ambiguity and riba, which are forbidden in Islamic sharee’ah.

Based on this, the profits earned through shares in insurance companies are also haraam. The 
    Muslim who has indulged in any of these things and taken any of these profits should get rid of them and spend them in charitable ways. 
The Muslim has to seek to earn a halaal

What is the ruling on that? What does his wife have to do if she was unaware of that ruling?,,,"Praise be to Allah.The one who has intercourse during the day in Ramadan when he is fasting and is not traveling has to offer a serious expiation, which is to free a slave; if he cannot do that then he has to fast for two consecutive months; if he cannot do that then he has to feed sixty poor persons. 
The same applies to the woman if that happened with her consent, but if she was forced to do it then she does not have to do anything. If they were traveling then there is no sin on them and they do not have to offer expiation, and they do not have to refrain from eating or drinking for the rest of the day. However, they do have to make up that day, because fasting is not obligatory for them. The same applies if he broke his fast for an essential reason, such as saving the life of someone whose life is protected according to sharee’ah; if he has intercourse on that day when he broke his fast for an essential reason, there is no sin on him, because he has not violated an obligatory fast.  
If a person who is fasting in his homeland and who is obliged to fast has intercourse, there are five things that result from that: 
1-He is guilty of a sin
2-His fast is broken
3-He has to refrain from eating and drinking for the rest of the day
4-He has to make that day up
5-He has to offer expiation (kafaarah)
The evidence that he has to offer expiation was narrated in the hadith of Abu Hurayrah about the man who had intercourse with his wife during the day in Ramadan. This man could not fast or feed the poor, so the obligation of offering expiation was dropped, because Allah does not burden a soul beyond its scope, and there is no obligation when one is unable to fulfil it. It makes no difference whether he ejaculated or not, so long as intercourse took place, in contrast with one who ejaculates without having intercourse – in that case there is no expiation to be offered. Rather in this case it is a sin and he has to refrain from eating or drinking for the rest of the day, and make up his fast later on.","Al-Fataawa al-Jaami’ah li’l-Mar’ah al-Muslimah, vol. 1, p. 348"

What should I do?",,,"Praise be to Allah.A child who is three years old should see his mother and father praying, and he should hear them reciting Quran, for if a child hears his parents and brothers reciting Quran and daily dhikr (words of remembrance) repeatedly, this nourishes his soul and brings his heart to life as the rain brings life to a dry barren land, because when a child hears his parents remembering Allah and sees them worshipping him, that has an effect on his own words and actions. 
An example of that is the following story of a young girl: 
Her mother finished her Wudu, and her three-year-old daughter washed her face and hands, copying her mother, then she raised her forefinger saying, “Laa ilaaha ill-Allah.” This indicates that the little girl had been watching her mother and noticed that there was a specific dhikr to be said after making Wudu. 
In another story, a mother did the Sunnah of Wudu (saying “Laa ilaaha ill-Allah”) one day, then she got up to finish her housework. Her daughter had gotten used to seeing her mother sitting after praying until she had finished reciting the du’aa’s (supplications) to be said after prayer, and she noticed that her mother had got up straight after doing the Sunnah prayer, so she said to her, “Why did you get up before saying, “Astaghfir-Allah”? This attitude indicates how closely children watch their parents. 
Man is exposed to sickness and diseases, and a child may fall ill. Then his illness should be an opportunity to strengthen his relationship with Allah, by reminding him of the virtues of good health, and that it is the blessing of Allah, and that we must thank Him for that, and that man has no power and no strength except with his Lord. When giving him medicine or going to the hospital, we should tell him that healing comes from Allah, but these are means which Allah has enjoined upon us. Then we should get them accustomed to ruqyah (incantations)as prescribed in sharee’ah. We should tell them about the example of the Prophets and how they took the necessary means and put their trust in Allah, such as the story of Ayyoob (peace be upon him) and his sickness, and the story of Ya’qoob (peace be upon him), when he told his sons to enter by different gates, and that would not avail them against Allah at all, and how he left the matter to Allah. Allah tells us that Ya’qoob said: 
“Do not enter by one gate, but enter by different gates, and I cannot avail you against Allah at all”
[Yoosuf 12:67 – interpretation of the meaning]
One of the most important things is to remind children to seek reward and to bear sickness and medical treatment with patience. One little girl reminded her mother that Allah wanted her to bear with patience the sickness which the doctors described as chronic. That was according to human doctors, but healing is in the hand of Allah. The mother remembered that this child had to take medicine twice every day, and her mother always reminded her to seek reward. One day this little girl said to her mother, “I will get reward because I am taking this medicine.” She said that as if she felt proud of this reward and the reward that her family and siblings would receive.","From Ummahaat qurb Abnaa’ihinna, p. 21"
22959,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22959,Does an Enema Break Your Fast?,What is the ruling on enemas given to a sick person when he is fasting?,"If doctors say that the enema is like food or drink, then it should be classified as such and thus it breaks the fast. If they say that the enema does not give the body what food and drink give it, then it does not break the fast.",,"Praise be to Allah.Concerning enemas which are given to sick people to counteract constipation, there is a difference of opinion among the scholars. Some say that enemas do break the fast, based on the fact that everything that reaches inside the digestive tract breaks the fast. And some of them said that enemas do not break the fast. Among those who said that was Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, who said that this is not food or drink, and it is not like food or drink. 
What I think is that we should look at the doctors’ opinions concerning that. If they say that the enema is like food or drink, then it should be classified as such and thus it breaks the fast. If they say that the enema does not give the body what food and drink give it, then it does not break the fast.

22960,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22960,"Ruling on one who has intercourse with his wife during the day in Ramadaan a number of times, not knowing the ruling","What Ruling on one who has intercourse with his wife during the day in Ramadaan a number of times, not knowing the ruling?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Undoubtedly 
    Allaah has forbidden His slaves to eat, drink or have intercourse during the 
    day in Ramadaan, or to do anything that might break the fast.  He has 
    enjoined that the one who has intercourse during the day in Ramadaan, who is 
    accountable, of good health and settled, not sick or traveling, has to offer 
    expiation (kafaarah), which is freeing a slave; if he cannot afford that, 
    then he must fast two consecutive months. If he is unable to do that then he 
    must feed sixty poor persons, giving each one half a saa’ of the staple food 
    of the country. But with regard to one who has intercourse during the day in 
    Ramadaan, and who is one of those who are obliged to fast because he is an 
    adult, in good health and settled (not traveling), but he was ignorant of 
    the ruling – there is a difference of opinion among the scholars in this 
    case. Some of them said that he has to offer the expiation because he was 
    negligent and did not bother to ask and find out about the religion. Other 
    scholars said that he does not have to offer expiation because of ignorance. 
    From this you can know that in order to be on the safe side, you should 
    offer the expiation, because of your negligence and not asking about what is 
    forbidden for you before you did what you did.  If you cannot free a slave 
    or fast, it is sufficient for you to feed sixty poor persons for each day 
    that you had intercourse. So if you had intercourse on two days, you have to 
    offer two expiations; if you had intercourse on three days, you have to 
    offer three expiations, and so on, one expiation for each day you had 
    intercourse. But if you had intercourse several times on one day, one 
    expiation is enough for that. This is so as to be on the safe side and this 
    is better for you, so that you will be free of blame and will avoid an area 
    concerning which there is scholarly dispute, and to make up for your fasts. 
    If you do not remember the number of days on which you had intercourse, then 
    do what is on the safe side, which is the higher number – so if you are not 
    sure whether it was three or four days, assume it was four, and so on. But 
    you should not do anything except what you are sure about. May Allaah help 
    us and you to do that which pleases Him, and frees us from blame.","Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, vol. 15, p. 304"

22963,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22963,Ruling on wearing shorts when playing sport and exercising,"I play basketball, so I wear shorts when practicing and when playing in matches. Is this haraam?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Playing sport is permissible if that does not distract one 
    from something that is obligatory. If it distracts you from something that 
    is obligatory then it becomes haraam, and if it becomes a person’s way of 
    life so that it takes up most of his time, then it is a waste of time, and 
    in this case at the very least it is makrooh.

     With regard to playing sport wearing only shorts which show 
    the thighs or most of them, this is not permissible. The correct view is 
    that young men must cover their thighs, and it is not permissible to watch 
    players when they have their thighs uncovered in this manner.","Fatwa of Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen from Fataawa Islamiyyah, vol. 4, p. 430"
22965,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22965,Is there one or two tasleems at the end of the prayer?,"When finishing the prayer, should we say one tasleem or two?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    The majority of scholars said that one tasleem is sufficient 
    because evidence to that effect was narrated in some ahaadeeth. But a group 
    of scholars stated that there have to be two tasleems because of the 
    soundness of the ahaadeeth from the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) which prove that, and because he said: “Pray as you have 
    seen me praying.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh). This view 
    is the one which is correct. 

    The view that one tasleem is sufficient is da’eef (weak) because of the weakness of the ahaadeeth that were narrated concerning that, and because there is ambiguity in these reports. If they are saheeh then they are shaadhdh (odd), because they go against reports which are more saheeh, more sound and more clear. But whoever does that – i.e., says one tasleem – out of ignorance or believing that the ahaadeeth concerning that are saheeh, his prayer is still valid. And Allaah is the Source of strength.","Tuhfat al-Ikhwaan, p. 112"
22980,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/22980,Ruling on bringing a servant without a mahram,I am a woman living in a non-Muslim country because of my husband’s work. I want to bring a servant from another country to help me in the house. Is it permissible for me to bring her without a mahram?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Bringing a servant without a mahram is an act 
    of disobedience towards the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), because it was narrated in a saheeh report that 
    he said: “No woman should travel without a mahram.” And because bringing her without a mahram may be a cause of her being a source of fitnah 
    (temptation) and exposing her to fitnah herself. That which may cause fitnah is forbidden, because that which may lead to something haraam is also 
    haraam. 
With regard to the fact that some people take 
    this matter lightly, this is a calamity, and their saying that this is necessary does not count as proof, because even if we assume that it is 
    necessary to bring servants, it is not necessary to bring them without mahrams. Similarly the opinion of some of them that the sin of her 
    travelling without a mahram is on her shoulders or those of the company that brings servants into the country does not count as proof either, 
    because the one who makes it easy for another to do something haraam is a partner in the sin and in helping him to commit it. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Help you one another in Al-Birr and 
    At-Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression”
[al-Maa’idah 5:2]
Allaah and His Messenger have commanded us to enjoin that which good and forbid that which is 
    evil. Bringing a female servant without a mahram is approving evil, not forbidding or denouncing it.

1.	Knowing the ruling
2.	Not forgetting that one is fasting
3.	Doing it with free will.","Inhaling flour While fasting


Guidelines concerning matters that break the fast","Praise be to Allah.Inhaling flour While fasting
Inhaling flour by one who is grinding grain does not spoil his fast, and his fast is valid, because when this happens it is not by their choice, and they did not mean for it to reach their stomachs.
Guidelines concerning matters that break the fast
I would like to take this opportunity to explain that matters which break a person’s fast – namely intercourse, eating, drinking, etc. only do so if you know (the ruling). However, if you do not know the ruling then they do not break your fast, because Allah says (interpretation of the meanings): 
“And there is no sin on you concerning that in which you made a mistake, except in regard to what your hearts deliberately intend.” [Al-Ahzab 33:5] 
“Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error.” [Al-Baqarah 2:286]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “My ummah is forgiven for their mistakes, forgetfulness, and what they are forced to do against their will.” The one who is ignorant is making a mistake, and if he knew he would not have done that, so if he does something that breaks the fast out of ignorance, then he is not to blame and his fast is complete and is valid, whether he was ignorant concerning the ruling or the time. 
A similar case is when a person does something that breaks the fast, thinking that it does not break the fast, such as one who has cupping done, thinking that cupping does not break the fast. We would say to him, your fast is valid and you do not have to do anything. And there are other things which happen to a person not by his choice; so there is no blame on him and that does not break his fast, for the reasons we have mentioned. 
In conclusion, matters that break the fast only break it when three conditions are met: 

Knowing the ruling
Not forgetting that he is fasting
Doing so by choice.
