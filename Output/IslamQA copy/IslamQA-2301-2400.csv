is presumed dead, because we go by what is apparent and most likely 
to be the case. So his wealth may be inherited if the qaadi rules that 
he is dead, and his wife should wait out the ‘iddah period, then she

2320,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2320,Are Blood Transfusions Haram in Islam?,What is the ruling of the Shari’ah on blood transfusions?,"If the person who is to receive the blood transfusion is a person whose life is in danger due to sickness or injury, and whose life depends on his receiving a blood transfusion, then blood transfusion is not haram. For more, see the detailed answer.","Who should receive a blood transfusion?


Whose blood can be taken?


Who should decide whether a blood transfusion is needed?","Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim Al al-Shaykh (may Allah have mercy on him) answered a question about blood transfusions as follows:
 In order to answer this question, we need to discuss three matters:
 1. Who is the person who is to receive the blood transfusion?
2. Who is the person from whom the blood is to be taken?
3. Who is the person whom we can trust to decide whether a blood transfusion is needed?
Who should receive a blood transfusion?
With regard to the first question, the person who is to receive the blood transfusion is a person whose life is in danger due to sickness or injury, and whose life depends on his receiving a blood transfusion.
The principle in this matter is based on the following verse of the Quran (interpretation of the meanings):
“He has forbidden you only the maytatah (dead animals), and blood, and the flesh of swine, and that which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allah. But if one is forced by necessity without willful disobedience nor transgressing the limits, then there is no sin on him…” [al-Baqarah 2:173]
“… But as for him who is forced by severe hunger, with no inclination to sin (such can eat these above-mentioned meats), then surely, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [al-Maidah 5:3]
“… He has explained to you in detail what is forbidden to you, except under compulsion of necessity…” [al-An’am 6:119]
The evidence derived from these verses tells us that if the recovery of the sick or injured person depends on a blood transfusion which he needs to save his life, and that there is no other medicine or food that can do the same thing, then it is permissible for him to receive a blood transfusion.
In fact, this comes under the heading of nourishment, not medicine (using forbidden foodstuffs in cases of necessity is permissible, as in the case of a starving man eating dead meat).
Whose blood can be taken?
With regard to the second point, the one from whom blood is taken, this should not result in any serious harm, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There should be no causing harm nor reciprocating harm.”
Who should decide whether a blood transfusion is needed?
As regards the third point, which is the matter of whose opinion should be relied upon to decide whether a blood transfusion is needed, this should be a Muslim doctor. If that is not possible, we see nothing wrong with taking the word of a non-Muslim doctor, whether he is Jewish or Christian (or any other religion), so long as he is experienced in medicine and is trustworthy. 
The principle here is the sahih hadith which describes how the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) hired a man of Bani Dil as a skilled and experienced guide, although he was a follower of the pagan religion of Quraysh. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 2104.) (Fatawa al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim).
Concerning this matter, the Hay’at Kibar al-‘Ulama (Council of Senior Scholars) stated the following:
1. It is permissible to donate blood , so long as this does not cause him any harm, when there is a need for it to help other Muslims.
2. It is permissible to establish Islamic blood banks to receive and store donated blood, to be kept for any Muslim who may be in need of it, so long as no money is charged to the sick person or the people in charge of his affairs in return for this service.  A blood bank should not be set up as a commercial enterprise or a means of making money , because it is in the public interest of the Muslims.

2322,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2322,Is wearing jeans imitating the Kuffar?,"Is wearing jeans considered imitating the Kuffar or is it
ok?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Imitating means trying to be like someone, which the fuqahaa' understand to mean being similar in a certain way to the person whom one is imitating. The Muslim is not permitted to imitate the Kuffar by wearing clothing that is unique to them and for which they are known, like the belt worn by Christian monks, or the distinctive headgear of Magians (Zoroastrians) and Jews, because of the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): ""Whoever imitates a people is one of them."" (Reported by Abu Dawood, 4/314).
The scholars have specified that the prohibition of imitation applies in two cases:
1. Where what is imitated is clothing that is characteristic of the Kuffar, not things that are worn by others too or things that used to be distinct to them but have now become widespread among other groups too - like the jeans referred to in the question.
2. When the act of imitation happens at a time when the clothing in question is characteristic of the Kuffar. This is because al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) reported that Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) saw some people wearing shawl-like garments over their heads and shoulders, and said, ""They look like the Jews of Khaybar."" Ibn Hajar commented: ""This could be used as evidence that this kind of garment was characteristic of the Jews at that time, but this is no longer the case, so that garment is now counted as something that is in general permitted."" (Fath al-Baari, 10/275).
The scholars also made an exception concerning Muslims wearing the distinctive clothes of the Kuffar when living in daar al-harb (non-Muslim countries which are at war with Muslims) or for purposes which will benefit the Muslims. Shaykh al-Islaam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
""When a Muslim is living in a non-Muslim land (whether or not it is hostile to Islam), he is not expected to differ from them (the Kuffar) in his outward appearance, because of the harm that may result (from dressing as a Muslim). It is preferable, even obligatory, for a man to look like them sometimes, if that will achieve some religious purpose such as calling them to Islam, finding out their secrets in order to tell the Muslims about them, repelling their harm from the Muslims, and other worthwhile aims. But in the Muslim lands where Allah has caused His religion to prevail, and where the Kuffar are in an inferior position and are paying jizyah (taxes paid by non-Muslims living under an Islamic government), it is obligatory for Muslims to look different from the Kuffar."" (Iqtidaa' al-Siraat al-Mustaqeem, 1/418).
It is clear from the above that jeans are not clothes that are characteristic of the Kuffar or worn only by them, so they are not haraam. However, it is more befitting for the Muslim to try to wear distinctive Islamic dress wherever he is, in obedience to the way of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The Muslim should feel in his heart that he hates the Kuffar and the way they look and behave. This hatred will motivate him to avoid looking like them at all in the way he dresses or in other ways. Do you not see that a person who despises a people or tribe, or people from a certain country, will hate to dress like them, especially if they are poor. As Shaykh al-Islam (Ibn Taymiyah) said: ""Looking like them in external appearance indicates that one loves them in one's heart, and vice versa.""

Protection from the harm of the jinn","Praise be to Allah.What are jinn?
The Quran and Sunnah indicate that the jinn exist, and that there is a purpose for their existence in this life, which is to worship Allah Alone, with no partner or associate. Allah says (interpretation of the meanings):
And I (Allah) created not the jinn and humans, except that they should worship Me (Alone). [al-Dhariyat 51:56].
O assembly of jinn and mankind! Did there not come to you messengers from amongst you, reciting unto you My Verses? [al-An'am 6:130]
The world of the jinn is an independent and separate world, with its own distinct nature and features that are hidden from the world of humans. The jinn and humans have some things in common, such as the possession of understanding and the choice between the way of good and the way of evil. The word jinn comes from an Arabic root meaning hidden from sight. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
Verily he [Shaytan] and qabiluhu [his soldiers from the jinn or his tribe] see you from where you cannot see them [al-A'raf 7:27]
Origin of jinn
Allah has told us in His Book the essence from which the jinn were created. He says (interpretation of the meaning):
And the jinn, We created aforetime from the smokeless flame of fire. [al-Hijr 15:27]
And the jinns did He create from a smokeless flame of fire. [al-Rahmaan 55:15].
According to a hadith narrated by ‘Aishah, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: The angels were created from light, the jinn were created from fire, and Adam was created from that which has been described to you. (Reported by Muslim, 5314)
Types of jinn in Islam
Allah has created different types of jinn. Among them are some who can take on different forms, such as dogs and snakes; some who are like flying winds with wings; and some who can travel and rest. Abu Tha'labah al-Khushani said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: The jinn are of three types: a type that has wings, and they fly through the air; a type that looks like snakes and dogs; and a type that stops for a rest then resumes its journey. (Reported by al-Tahawi in Mushkil al-Athar, 4/95, and by al-Tabarani in al-Kabir, 22/214. Shaykh al-Albani said in al-Mishkat (2/1206, no. 4148): al-Tahawi and Abul-Shaykh reported it with a sahih isnad)
The jinn and the sons of Adam
Every individual among the sons of Adam has a jinn who has been appointed to be his constant companion (qarin). Ibn Mas’ud said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, There is not one of you who does not have a jinni appointed to be his constant companion. They said, And you too, O Messenger of Allah? He said, Me too, but Allah has helped me and he has submitted, so that he only helps me to do good. (Reported by Muslim, 2814)
Al-Nawawi said in his commentary on Muslim (17/175): 
“He has submitted: he became a believing Muslim. This is the apparent meaning. Al-Qadi said: Know that the ummah is agreed upon the fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was protected from Shaytan, physically and mentally, and with regard to his speech. This hadith contains a reference to the warning against the fitnah (temptation, trial) and whispers of the qarin (constant companion from among the jinn). We know that he is with us so we should beware of him as much as possible.”
The powers of the jinn
Allah has given the jinn powers that he has not given to humans. Allah has told us about some of their powers, such as the ability to move and travel quickly. An ‘ifreet from among the jinn guaranteed to the Prophet Sulayman (peace be upon him) that he would bring the throne of the Queen of Yemen to Jerusalem in a moment faster than that needed for a man to get up from where he was sitting. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
An ‘ifreet (strong one) from the jinn said: I will bring it [her throne] to you before you rise from your place (council). And verily, I am indeed strong, and trustworthy for such work. One with whom was knowledge of the Scripture said: I will bring it to you within the twinkling of an eye! Then when Sulayman saw it placed before him, he said, This is by the Grace of my Lord [al-Naml 27:39-40].
Food and drink of the jinn
The jinn eat and drink. Ibn Mas’ud said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Someone from among the jinn called me, and I went with him and recited the Quran for them. He took us and showed us the traces of where they had been and the traces of their fires. They asked him for food and he said, You can have every bone on which the name of Allah has been mentioned that comes into your possession, as meat, and all the droppings as food for your animals. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, So do not use [these things] for cleaning yourselves [after relieving oneself], for they are the food and provision of your brothers. (Reported by Muslim, 450). 
According to another report: A delegation of jinn from Nasibin came to me, and what good jinn they are! They asked me for food and I prayed to Allah for them, so that they would not pass by bones or droppings, but they would find food on them. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 3571). The believing jinn may eat any bone on which the name of Allah has been mentioned, because the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not permit them to have anything on which Allah's name has not been mentioned; those are for the kuffar among the jinn.
The beasts of the jinn
According to the hadith narrated by Ibn Mas’ud, that we have quoted above, the jinn asked the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) for provision, and he said to them: and [you can have] all the droppings as food for your animals.
The dwelling-places of the jinn
The jinn live on this earth where we do. They are mostly to be found in ruins and unclean places like bathrooms, dunghills, garbage dumps and graveyards. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught us to take precautions when entering such places, by reciting the adhkar (words of remembrance) prescribed in Islam. One of these was reported by Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) entered the toilet, he would say, Allahumma innee a'udhu bika min al-khubuthi wal-khabaith (O Allah, I seek refuge with You from the evil ones, male and female).
(Reported by al-Bukhari, 142; and Muslim, 375). Al-Khattabi explained that khubuth is the plural of khabith (evil or dirty masculine form), and khabaith is the plural of khabithah (evil or dirty feminine form), and that what is meant is male and female shayatin.
Some jinn are Muslims and some are unbelievers
Allah tells us that some of the jinn said (interpretation of the meaning):
And some of us are Muslims, and some of us are al-qasitun (disbelievers those who have deviated from the Right Path). And whosoever has embraced Islam, then such have sought the Right Path. And as for the qasitun, they shall be firewood for Hell. [al-Jinn 72:14-15]
The Muslims among the jinn are of different levels as regards righteousness and taqwa. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
[Some jinn said:] There are among us some that are righteous, and some the contrary; we are groups, each having a different way (religious sects, etc.) [al-Jinn 72:11]
The story of how the first jinn of this ummah became Muslim was narrated by Abd-Allah ibn Abbas, who said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) went out with a group of his Companions heading for the marketplace of Ukaz. This was when the shayatهn were prevented from getting any news from heaven, and shooting stars had been sent against them. The shayatهn went back to their people, who said, What is the matter with you? They said, We cannot get news from heaven, and shooting stars were sent against us. Their people said, Nothing is stopping you from hearing news from heaven except some new event that must have happened. Go and look in the east and the west of the earth, and see if you can find out what it is that is stopping you from hearing news from heaven. Those who went out in the direction of Tihamah came upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in Nakhlah, when he was on his way to Ukaz, and found him leading his Companions in Fajr prayer. When they heard the Quran, they listened to it and said, By Allah, this is what is stopping us from hearing news from heaven. When they went back to their people, they said, O our people, we have heard a wonderful Recital (the Quran). It guides to the Right Path, and we have believed therein, and we shall never join (in worship) anything with our Lord (Allah). [al-Jinn 72:2 interpretation of the meaning]. Then Allah revealed to His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) the words (interpretation of the meaning): Say (O Muhammad): It has been revealed to me that a group of the jinn listened (to this Quran) [al-Jinn 72:1], and Allah revealed to him what the jinn had said. (reported by al-Bukhari, 731).
Their reckoning on the Day of Resurrection
The jinn will be called to account on the day of Resurrection . Mujahid (may Allah have mercy on him) said, concerning the ayah (interpretation of the meaning): but the jinn know well that they have indeed to appear (before Him) (i.e., they will be brought to account) [al-Saffat 37:158]: They will be brought to judgement. Sahih al-Bukhari, Bab Dhikr al-Jinn wa Thawabihim wa Iqabihim.
Protection from the harm of the jinn
Because the jinn can see us while we cannot see them , the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught us many ways to protect ourselves from their harm , such as seeking refuge with Allah from the accursed Shaytan, reciting Surat al-Falaq and Surat al-Nas (the last two Surahs of the Quran), and reciting the words taught by Allah in the Quran (interpretation of the meaning): Say: My Lord! I seek refuge with You from the whisperings (suggestions) of the shayatin (devils). And I seek refuge with You, my Lord, lest they may attend (or come near) me. [al-Muminun 23:97-98]
Saying Bismillah (in the Name of Allah) before entering ones home, before eating or drinking, and before having intercourse will also keep the Shaytan from entering the house or partaking with a person in his food, drink and sexual activity. Similarly, mentioning the name of Allah before entering the toilet or taking off one's clothes will prevent the jinn from seeing a person's ‘awrah or harming him, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, To put a barrier that will prevent the jinn from seeing the ‘awrah of the sons of Adam, let anyone of you say Bismillah when entering the toilet. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 551; Sahih al-Jam’i, 3611).
Strength of faith and religion in general will also prevent the jinn from harming a person, so much so that if they were to fight, the one who has faith would win. Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: A man from among the Companions of Muhammad met a man from among the jinn. They wrestled, and the human knocked down the jinni. The human said to him, You look small and skinny to me, and your forearms look like the front paws of a dog. Do all the jinn look like this, or only you? He said, No, by Allah, among them I am strong, but let us wrestle again, and if you defeat me I will teach you something that will do you good. The human said, Fine. He said, Recite, Allah! None has the right to be worshipped but He, the Ever-living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists [Ayat al-Kursi al-Baqarah 2:255 interpretation of the meaning]. The human said, Fine. He said, You will never recite this in your house but the Shaytan will come out of it like a donkey breaking wind, and he will never come back in until the next morning. (Reported by al-Darimi, 3247)

How to count tasbih with fingers","Praise be to Allah.Dhikr after Salah (prayer)
The dhikr after salah referred to in the question has been reported in a hadith reported by Abu Hurayrah from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Whoever glorifies Allah (says Subhan Allah ) thirty-three times immediately after each prayer, and praises Allah (says Al-hamdu Lillah) thirty-three times, and magnifies Allah (says Allahu akbar) thirty-three times, this makes ninety-nine, then to complete one hundred says La ilaha ill-Allah wahdahu la sharika lahu, lahul-mulk wa lahul-hamd wa huwa ‘ala kulli shayin qadir (There is no god except Allah Alone, with no partner, His is the power and His is the praise, and He is Able to do all things) his sins will be forgiven even if they are like the foam of the sea.” (Reported by Muslim, 939).
A number of different descriptions of the dhikr after salah have been narrated, an example of which has been referred to in the question. The evidence for this is the hadith of Abd-Allah ibn Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: There are two qualities, no Muslim man acquires them but he will enter Paradise, and they are simple and easy. He should glorify Allah (say Subhan Allah) ten times immediately after each prayer, and praise Him (say Al-hamdu Lillah) ten times and magnify Him (say Allahu akbar) ten times. I saw the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) counting this on his fingers. He said: That makes one hundred and fifty on the tongue, and one thousand five hundred (hasanat) in the scales.
[Translator's note: each of three phrases repeated ten times makes thirty; multiplied by the number of daily prayers, which is five, makes one hundred and fifty. Each of these good deeds of the tongue will be rewarded with ten hasanat which will be added to the total of good deeds to be weighed in the balance or scales on the Day of Judgement]. When you go to bed, glorify Him and praise Him and magnify Him one hundred times: that will be one hundred on the tongue and a thousand in the scales. Who among you does two thousand and five hundred sayyiat (bad deeds) in one day? They said: How could we not count (our sins)? He said: The Shaytan comes to any one of you whilst he is praying and says, Remember this, remember that, until he finishes his prayer and does not do (this dhikr), or he comes to him when he is lying down and makes him sleepy, until he falls asleep (without doing this dhikr). (Abu ‘Isa said: This is a hasan sahih hadith. Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 3332).
Dhkir before sleeping 
Among the adhkar that may be recited before going to sleep, as referred to in the question, is that reported in the hadith of ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him), who said that Fatimah (upon whom be peace) came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and asked him for a servant. He said, “Shall I not tell you of something that is better for you than that? When you go to sleep, say Subhan Allah thirty-three times, Al-hamdu Lillah thirty-three times, and Allahu akbar thirty four times.” (Reported by al-Bukhari, 4943)
How to count tasbih with fingers
As regards counting this tasbih , the Sunnah is to use the fingers of the right hand, although it is permitted to use the left hand. The evidence that the right hand is preferable was reported by Abu Dawud (may Allah have mercy on him), who said: ‘Ubayd-Allah ibn ‘Umar ibn Maysarah and Muhammad ibn Qudamah, among others, told us: Aththam told us from al-A’mash from ‘Ata ibn al-Saib from his father from Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr who said: I saw the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) counting the tasbih. Ibn Qudamah said: With his right hand. (Sunan Abi Dawud, Kitab al-Salah, Bab al-Tasbih bil-hasa)
It was said in Hashiyat at-Tahtawi: “It is correct that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to count the tasbih on his right hand. It was reported that he said: Count with your finger tips, for they will be asked and they will be made to speak. Ibn Hijr said: Counting the tasbih with the fingertips is better than using the subhah (prayer-beads or rosary).”
The sunnah is to count with the fingertips by putting them on the palm of the hand. As to precisely which finger of the right hand one should start with, I have no specific information on this.

    65:1]. If a Muslim wants to divorce his wife, he should divorce her according to the
    Sunnah, which is to give one talaaq at a time when his wife is taahir (not menstruating)
    and he has not yet had intercourse with her following her period, or when it is clear that
    she is pregnant. According to the Shaafi’i madhhab and the majority of other
    madhhabs, giving three talaaqs at once counts as three separate talaaqs and is
    irrevocable, and the couple cannot remarry until the woman has been married to and
    divorced from another man. Other scholars say that three talaaqs given at once count as
    only one talaaq.

2378,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2378,Mahr Is the Wife’s Right,"I would like to know the Islamic view point of mahr (dowry). Is it permissible for the wife to take it or is it a sin?  If it is wrong, what should a person who has taken mahr do?","Mahr in Islam is the right of the wife, and it is not permitted for her father or anyone else to take it except with her approval.","Mahr in Islam


Evidence for the permissibility of taking the mahr


Can the father take the mahr without the wife’s approval?


Can the wife forgo any part of the mahr?","Praise be to Allah.Mahr in Islam
Mahr  is one of the rights of the wife, which is hers to take in total and is lawful for her, in contrast to the widespread practice in some countries, where the wife is given no dowry. 
Evidence for the permissibility of taking the mahr
Evidence that the wife must be given her dowry is found in many places, for example the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “And give to the women (whom you marry) their mahr (obligatory bridal gift given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage) with a good heart…” [al-Nisa 4:4]
Ibn 'Abbas said: “This refers to the mahr (dowry).”
Ibn Kathir, may Allah have mercy on him, said, summarizing the comments of the mufassirin on this verse: “The man must definitely pay the dowry to the woman, and he should not resent it.”
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “But if you intend to replace a wife by another and you have given one of them a cantar (of gold, i.e., a great amount) as mahr, take not the least bit of it back; would you take it wrongfully without a right and (with) a manifest sin? And how could you take it (back) when you have gone in unto each other, and they have taken from you a firm and strong covenant?” [al-Nisa 4:20-21]
Ibn Kathir, may Allah have mercy on him, said: 
“This means: if any one of you wants to divorce his wife and replace her with another, you should not take anything from what you have already given the first wife, even if it was a huge amount of wealth. The mahr is given in exchange for the right to enjoy marital relations. For this reason Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And how could you take it (back) when you have gone in unto each other…?” The “firm and strong covenant” is the marriage contract.
Anas ibn Malik, may Allah be pleased with him, reported that ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn ‘Awf came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and there were traces of yellow (perfume) on him. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked him about it, and he told him that he had just married a woman of the Ansar. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked him, “How much did you give her?” He said: “Gold equal to the weight of one date stone.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Give a walimah (wedding feast) even if only with one sheep.” (Reported by al-Bukhari, 4756)
Can the father take the mahr without the wife’s approval?
The mahr is the right of the wife, and it is not permitted for her father or anyone else to take it except with her approval. Abu Salih said: “When a man married off his daughter, he would take her mahr away from her, but Allah forbade them to do that, and gave women the right to the mahr they received.” (Tafsir Ibn Kathir)
Can the wife forgo any part of the mahr? 
Similarly, if the wife foregoes any part of the mahr , the husband is permitted to take it, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… but if they, of their own good pleasure, remit any part of it, take it, and enjoy it without fear of any harm (as Allah has made it lawful).” [al-Nisa 4:4]

      think? He is not doing nothing wrong, just being happy. I will like to receive a response.
      I am very interested. Thanks,",,,"Praise be to Allah.A Muslim man is permitted to marry anyone he likes of the women whom
    Allaah has allowed him to marry, but he is encouraged to marry a Muslim woman who is
    religious and has a good moral character (because this is the basis of true happiness).
    Similarly, he is permitted to marry a chaste woman of the People of the Book, i.e., Jews
    and Christians. Another basis for a happy marriage is that his parents should be pleased
    with his choice of bride, and part of the way in which parents show their love and
    kindness towards their son is by helping him to get married, whether financially or in
    other ways. As regards what you say about striving and fighting for the sake of love, we
    should stop and think about this matter carefully. We believe that feeling love for a
    particular woman is not the be-all and end-all in a Muslim’s life, for which he
    should give up everything that matters to him. No way! The Muslim is wise and pays
    attention to everything that is in his interests, such as the woman’s religious
    commitment and moral character, his parents’ approval, his own honour and reputation
    among people, the future of the marriage and its potential to endure, whether any bad
    things will result from his marriage to a particular woman and whether this outweighs his
    interests, the environment in which the children of the marriage will grow up, the nature
    of his future in-laws with whom he will have to mix, etc. It is not the matter of a
    fleeting desire, rather it is the matter of one’s future and eventual destiny. 
Finally, we say that the love of a woman is not
    some god to be worshipped, rather it is a matter that is governed by the laws of the One
    God, Allaah, the Lord of the Worlds.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
