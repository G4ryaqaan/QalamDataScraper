59905,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/59905,His mother will be angry if he does not celebrate Mother’s Day,"I have a friend from one of the Arab countries, and in that country Mother’s Day is an official holiday, which he celebrates with his brothers and sisters because of their mother. Now he wants to stop doing that, but his mother will be angry because she has become accustomed to this thing and it has become a tradition in their country. He is afraid that his mother will be angry with him and will bear a grudge against him until she dies not pleased with him. He has tried to convince her that it is haraam and why, but she is not convinced because of the atmosphere in their country. What should he do? Please advise us, may Allah bless you.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Celebrating Mother’s Day is an innovated matter which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his companions (may Allah be pleased with them) did not do. It is also an imitation of the kuffaar from whom we have been commanded to differ. Hence it is not permissible to celebrate it or to obey one's mother in that, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no obedience if it involves sin; obedience is only in that which is right and proper.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 7257; Muslim, 1840. 
He should continue to honour her and treat her with kindness, and keep trying to convince her that this celebration is a newly invented innovation. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The worst of matters are those which are newly-invented, and every innovation is a going-astray.” Narrated by Muslim, 867; al-Nasaa’i, 1578. Al-Nasaa’i’s report adds the words: “And every going astray will be in the Fire.” 
The mother is entitled to respect and honour, and upholding of the ties of kinship throughout her life, so what is the point of singling out a particular day to honour her? 
Moreover, this innovation has come to us from societies in which disobedience towards parents is widespread, in which mothers and fathers can find no refuge except old people’s homes, where they are left alone and no one visit them, and they spend their time in pain and sorrow. So they think that honouring their mothers for one day will erase the sin of their disobedience towards her during the rest of the year. 
But we Muslims have been commanded to honour our parents and uphold the ties of kinship, and we have been forbidden to disobey our parents. In our religion mothers have been given something which has not been given to them in any other religion; the mother’s rights take precedence over those of the father, as al-Bukhari (5514) and Muslim (4621) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: A man came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: “O Messenger of Allah, who is most deserving of my good company?” He said: “Your mother.” He said: “Then who?” He said: “Your mother.” He said: “Then who?” He said: “Your mother.” He said: “Then who?” He said: “Then your father.” 
Honouring one's mother does not come to an end even when she dies, for she is honoured in life and in death. That is done by offering the funeral prayer for her, praying for forgiveness for her, carrying out her last wishes and honouring her family and friends. 
Let us adhere to this great religion and follow its etiquettes and rulings, for in it is sufficient guidance and mercy. 
Shaykh ‘Ali Mahfouz (may Allah have mercy on him) said, explaining how this celebration (Mother’s Day) is an imitation of the kuffaar: 
Explaining the seriousness of celebrating festivals other than the Islamic Eids, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stated that some peoples or groups in his ummah would follow the People of the Book in some of their rituals and traditions, as is narrated in the hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him), who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “They will follow the ways of those who came before them, handspan by handspan, cubit by cubit, until even if they entered a lizard’s hole they will follow them.” We said: “O Messenger of Allah, (do you mean) the Jews and Christians?” He said: “Who else?” Narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim… 
Love of imitation, even if it is something that exists in people’s hearts, is forbidden in sharee’ah if the one who is being imitated differs from us in his beliefs and thinking, especially is what is being imitated is religious beliefs or acts of worship, or it is a ritual or tradition. When the Muslims became weak in this time, their imitation of their enemies became more widespread and many western traditions and customs became widespread, whether that has to do with consumer goods or attitudes and behaviour. One of these customs is the celebration of Mother’s Day. End quote. 
Shaykh Muhamamd ibn Saalih ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about celebrating Mother’s Day and he replied: 
All celebrations which differ from the Eids prescribed in Islam are innovated festivals which were not known at the time of the righteous salaf, and may also have come from the non-Muslims, in which case as well as being an innovation (bid’ah) they are also an imitation of the enemies of Allah. The festivals which are prescribed in Islam are well known to the Muslims: they are Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha, and the weekly “Eid” of Jumu’ah. There is no other festival in Islam apart from these three. All the festivals that have been invented apart from these are to be rejected because they are innovations and are false according to the laws of Allah, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever introduces anything into this matter of ours that is not part of it will have it rejected,” i.e., it will be thrown back at him and will not be accepted by Allah. According to another version: “Whoever does any deed that is not part of this matter of ours will have it rejected.” 
Once this is clear, then it is not permissible to show any of the signs of festivity on the celebration mentioned in the question, namely Mother’s Day. It is not permissible to show joy and happiness, or to offer gifts, and so on. 
The Muslim should feel proud of his religion and adhere to the limits set by Allah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in this religion, which Allah has chosen for His slaves, and he should not add anything or take anything away. What the Muslim should also do is to not to follow every new idea that comes along, rather his character should be in accordance with the sharee’ah of Allah so that he will be a leader and example, not a follower, because the sharee’ah of Allah – praise be to Allah – is complete in all ways as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion”
[al-Maa'idah 5:3]
A mother’s right is greater than having just one day in the year to be honoured, rather the mother’s right over her children is that they should take care of her and obey her, so long as it does not involve disobedience towards Allah, at all times and in all places.

59907,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/59907,He is in love with a girl and she loves him but he says that they are doing something good,"Allaah has guided me but in a strange way. What encouraged me to do that was a woman. She nearly destroyed me; she loved me but it was not a permissible kind of love. I got to know her through the internet, and I ask Allaah to forgive me for that. Now she is advising me and I am afraid that if I leave her she will do something to herself. I am also afraid that if she gets married and there are problems between her and her husband, she will say, “So and so is better than you, I wish that I had married him,” meaning me. How often I tried to leave her but I could not, for one reason, which is that we are attached to one another, the reason being that we get along and we are cooperating in righteousness and piety; she obeys me in anything that is pleasing to Allaah. I want to marry her, but she is engaged to one of her relatives and her family refuse to entertain the idea of her marrying a stranger. Every time I get away from her I feel that I am alone, and the Shaytaan comes to me when I am alone and tempts me. When I speak to her I feel at ease, because she reminds me of Allaah. Please help me, may Allaah have mercy on you.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    You should not hesitate to give up this girl and keep away 
    from her. The Shaytaan has clearly confused you both; he has made you do 
    something haraam, and has made it appear attractive to you by making you 
    think that it is obedience and drawing closer to Allaah. 
What you say in your 
    question is indicative of what we are saying. You say, “[Allaah] has guided 
    me”, “she is advising me”, “she obeys me in anything that is pleasing to 
    Allaah”, “we are cooperating in righteousness and piety” and “she reminds me 
    of Allah”. All of these are words that are acceptable in Islam, but the 
    Shaytaan has made them into lovers’ words.  

    We are certain that you would not agree for any of your own 
    sisters or daughters to enter into such a relationship, would you? So why do 
    you think that it is acceptable for other people’s daughters? 

    Do you think that if your own daughter did something like 
    this, corresponding and speaking to a non-mahram man when she is engaged to 
    one of your relatives, that you would approve of her actions, even if she 
    were to say to you, “Allaah has guided this young man at my hands, and I 
    remind him about Allaah, and we are cooperating in righteousness and piety, 
    and I am advising him”?! 

    I do not think that you would like it if your fiancée were to 
    correspond with a young man, or if a young man were to correspond with her 
    on the grounds of “sincere advice” or “cooperating in righteousness and 
    piety” etc. 

    No, by Allaah, we do not think that any wise person would 
    accept this, so do not be deceived by the Shaytaan’s making your deeds 
    appear attractive to you. End this relationship immediately and let this 
    girl go; do not worry about what she may say to her husband, because you are 
    not responsible for her and you have nothing to do with her. You don’t know 
    – perhaps she will marry someone who is better for her than you! 

    You say that she is engaged, and the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No man should propose to a woman to 
    whom his brother has already proposed marriage.” (Agreed upon). So it is not 
    permissible to do things the right way and approach her family, asking to 
    marry her; so how can it be permissible for you to speak to her and 
    correspond with her without her family knowing? 

    Fear Allaah, and leave her without any hesitation. Do not get 
    in touch with her again. Leave her and her business and her family alone. 
    Any woman who agrees to speak to non-mahram men when she is engaged or 
    married cannot be entrusted with a household or with the upbringing of her 
    daughters and sons. Beware lest Allaah punish you with regard to your own 
    family and children. I ask Allaah to guide you and help you. Give this up 
    for the sake of Allaah and Allaah will compensate you with something better 
    than that which you have given up.

What is the correct `Aqidah?","Praise be to Allah.Is Islamic `Aqidah Theoretical?
Islamic `Aqidah is not a theoretical and philosophical method; action is an essential part of this `Aqidah. Hence the Ahl As-Sunnah agreed that faith consists of words and deeds, or speaking with the tongue, believing in the heart and acting with the physical faculties. 
Whoever believes in Allah as his Lord and God, will worship Him and obey Him by praying, giving Zakah and so on. 
Whoever believes in the Last Day and its reckoning and reward or punishment, will be motivated thereby to do that which Allah has commanded and abstain from that which He has forbidden. 
Whoever believes that Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the Messenger of Allah will therefore obey him, follow his Sunnah and propagate his religion.  
Thus the principles in which a person believes are translated into actions and words and efforts. The stronger that faith grows in his heart, the more its effects will be seen outwardly. 
Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “In the body there is a piece of flesh which, if it is sound, the entire body will be sound, and if it is corrupt, the entire body will be corrupt. It is the heart.” Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 52; Muslim, 1599)
Al-Hasan Al-Basri (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Faith is not the matter of wishes or outward appearances, rather it is that which settles in the heart and is confirmed by one's actions.” 
Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“If the heart is sound in terms of faith, knowledge and feelings, then this will inevitably lead to the soundness of physical actions, such as verbal statements and deeds. As the leading scholars of Hadith said: Words and deeds, both inward and outward. What is outward must follow what is inward, so if what is inward is sound then what is outward will also be sound, and if it (the former) is corrupt, (the latter) will also be corrupt. Hence one of the Companions said concerning the one who prayed carelessly: If his heart had been humble and focused, his body would have been humble and focused.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 7/187)
Books on `Aqidah
With regard to books which one may read about `Aqidah , there are many, the greatest of which are the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), in which there is protection and salvation for those who adhere closely to them. The scholars were concerned with explaining and propagating sound `Aqidah , and they wrote innumerable books on this topic. Among the most famous of these books are the following: 

As-Sunnah by `Abdullah ibn Ahmad ibn Hanbal
At-Tawhid by Ibn Khuzaymah
Sharh Usul I`tiqad Ahl As-Sunnah by Al-Lalka’i
`Aqidat As-Salaf wa As-hab Al-Hadith by Al-Sabuni
Al-`Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah by Ibn Taymiyah [available in English translation]
Al-`Aqidah Al-Tahhawiyyah wa Sharhuha by Ibn Abu Al-`Izz Al-Hanafi
Lawami` Al-Anwar Al-Bahiyyah by Al-Safarini
Ma`arij Al-Qubul by Hafiz Hakami
Al-Irshad ila Sahih Al-I`tiqad by Shaykh Salih Al-Fawzan – this is an easy and useful book. 

How to apply `Aqidah in real life
With regard to applying this `Aqidah in real life, this is done by learning it, propagating it, calling others to it, and refuting those who go against it with wisdom and beautiful preaching. This is how `Aqidah is spread and its effects made manifest so that all people may benefit from it. 
How to learn `Aqidah
The way in which `Aqidah may be learned is to learn it directly from those who believe in it and act accordingly. This is the soundest and best way for those who are able to do it. For those who are far away from scholars, they should refer to their commentaries, writings and tapes, as well as asking about confusing matters and anything they do not understand. 
If a person follows some of the teachings of Islam and neglects others, by failing to do some of the obligatory duties or by committing some of the acts that are forbidden, this is a shortcoming in his faith and a weakness in his belief and his love for his Lord and His religion. This is undoubtedly a fault in his `Aqidah. 
Hence one of the basic principles of Ahl As-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah is that faith increases by doing acts of worship and decreases by doing acts of sin. These shortcomings and faults may erase faith altogether, so that the person becomes an apostate from Islam, such as if he stops praying. Please see question no. 5208  and 2182 . 
With regard to sins that do not reach the level of disbelief, such as withholding obligatory Zakah or looking at prohibited things and so on, these are things which cause faith to decrease. 
What is the correct `Aqidah?
The Muslims need people to explain pure, correct `Aqidah to them, that is based on the Quran and Sunnah according to the understanding of the righteous Salaf. That is because of the widespread existence of ignorance, innovations (Bid’ah), myths and deviant schools of thought. 
Every Muslim must be sincere towards himself first of all, by learning correct `Aqidah from trustworthy sources, then by propagating it and teaching it to the people, by means of lessons and lectures, books, publications and magazines, thus fulfilling the duty to convey the message as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“(And remember) when Allah took a covenant from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) to make it (the news of the coming of Prophet Muhammad and the religious knowledge) known and clear to mankind, and not to hide it.” [Al-`Imran 3:187] 
“Let there arise out of you a group of people inviting to all that is good (Islam), enjoining Al-Ma‘roof (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do) and forbidding Al-Munkar (polytheism and disbelief and all that Islam has forbidden). And it is they who are the successful.” [Al `Imran 3:104] 
“Say (O Muhammad): ‘This is my way; I invite unto Allah (i.e. to the Oneness of Allah — Islamic Monotheism) with sure knowledge, I and whosoever follows me (also must invite others to Allah, i.e. to the Oneness of Allah — Islamic Monotheism with sure knowledge). And Glorified and Exalted be Allah (above all that they associate as partners with Him). And I am not of the Mushrikun (polytheists, pagans, idolaters and disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah; those who worship others along with Allah or set up rivals or partners to Allah.)’” [Yusuf 12:108]

Can they pray behind someone who recites Qunut in Fajr?","Praise be to Allah.Is Qunut compulsory in Fajr?
It is not Sunnah to recite Qunut in Fajr prayer all the time. We have explained that in the answers to question no.  and 5459 . 
Can they pray behind someone who recites Qunut in Fajr?
Your prayer behind an Imam who recites Qunut in Fajr is valid, but if there is someone who does not always recite Qunut in Fajr, it is better to pray behind him, so as to follow the Sunnah. 
Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said concerning some matters of Ijtihad in which the scholars differed, such as Qunut in Fajr and Witr : 
“The scholars agreed that if a person does both, his worship is valid and there is no sin on him, but they had different views concerning which is better and what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to do. With regard to the issue of reciting Qunut in Fajr and Witr , the issue of whether the Basmalah should be spoken out loud, and the issue of the words used to seek refuge with Allah and so on ... They are agreed that if a person says the Basmalah out loud, his prayer is valid, and if a person says it silently his prayer is also valid; and that if a person recites Qunut in Fajr his prayer is valid and if he does not recite it his prayer is valid, and the same applies to Witr.” 
He also said (23/115): 
“From what we have mentioned it is clear that Qunut is to be recited at times of calamity… whoever says that it is an essential part of prayer which may be made up for with the prostration of forgetfulness is basing that on the idea that it is a Sunnah which is to be done all the time, like the first Tashahhud and so on. But it is clear that this is not the case; it is not a Sunnah that is to be done regularly, and no prostration of forgetfulness is required if it is omitted. If some believe that it is a regular Sunnah based on their own Ijtihaad this is fine, as in the case of all other issues of Ijtihad.
Hence the person who is praying behind an Imam should follow his Imam in issues where there is room for Ijtihaad. So if he recites Qunut he should recite it with him, and if he does not recite Qunut he should not recite it. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The Imam has been appointed to be followed.” And he said: “Do not differ from your Imams.” And it is proven in As-Sahih that he said: “They lead you in prayer; if they get it right (the reward) is for you and for them, and if they get it wrong, (the reward) is for you and (the sin) is on them.” 
Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: We have an Imam who recites Qunut in Fajr prayer all the time; should we follow him? Should we say Ameen to his Du`a’? 
He replied: 
“Whoever prays behind an Imam who recites Qunut in Fajr prayer, let him follow the Imam in Qunut in Fajr prayer, and say Ameen to his supplication. This was stated by Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him).” (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn `Uthaymin, 14/177) 
The Standing Committee was asked: Is it permissible to pray behind an Imam who holds his arms at his sides in his prayer and always recites Qunut in the last Rak`ah of Fajr prayer? 
They replied: 
“Putting the right hand over the left when praying is Sunnah, and holding the arms at the sides is contrary to the Sunnah. Always reciting Qunut in the last Rak’ah of Fajr prayer, as some of the Malikis and Shafi`is do, is contrary to the Sunnah because there is no proof that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did that. Rather he used to recite Qunut at times of calamity , and he used to recite Qunut in Witr prayer. If the Imam holds his arms at his side when praying and always recites Qunut in Fajr prayer, as mentioned in the question, then knowledgeable people should advise him and remind him to follow the Sunnah. If he responds, then praise be to Allah, but if he refuses and it is possible to offer prayers in congregation behind someone else, you should pray behind someone else so as to adhere to the Sunnah. But if that is not possible then you should pray behind him so as to keep the congregation together. The prayer in valid in either case.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Al-Da’imah, 7/366)

The evidence that istimaar using stones and the like is acceptable is the report narrated by al-Bukhaari (159) and Muslim (237) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), which says that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does wudoo’, let him rinse his nose, and whoever does istijmaar let him use an odd number.” 
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Ighaathat al-Lahfaan (1/151) that there is consensus among the Muslims that it is permissible to do istijmaar using stones both in the winter and in the summer. 
When doing istijmaar using stones, it is stipulated that one should wipe three times or more in order to clean the place properly. That is because Muslim (262) narrated that Salmaan al-Faarisi (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade us to clean ourselves using less than three stones.” 
Doing istinja’ with water is better, because of the report narrated by Muslim (271) and al-Nasaa’i (45) from Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: When I was a boy, when the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) entered the toilet I would carry a small vessel of leather filled with water, and he would clean himself with water.  
Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (1/206): 
If a person wants to do just one of them, then using water is better, because of the hadeeth that we have narrated, and because it purifies the place and removes the dirt itself and its traces, and is more cleansing. 
But limiting oneself to stones only is sufficient, and there is no difference of opinion among the scholars concerning that, because of the reports that we have mentioned and because that is the consensus of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them).

There were only three friends of the groom, one of whom appointed himself as a Shaykh and the other two as witnesses in the presence of the bride’s father. The marriage was done without even writing down any contract. This bride will leave the country after a year and a half, and will go back to her own country for good. The groom will divorce his bride at that time. The bride’s father stipulated that the marriage will only last so long as they are in Riyadh, and when they leave, the groom will divorce his bride. 

 1: What is the ruling on this marriage? 

 2: What is your opinion on what the friends of the groom did?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
If the 
    marriage is temporary and the specific time limit is mentioned, such as a 
    month or one year, or until the end of one’s studies or residency, etc., 
    then this is a mut’ah marriage and it is haraam and invalid according to the 
    majority of scholars. It is narrated that there was consensus that it is 
    haraam. 
Ibn Qudaamah 
    (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (7/136): 
“Mut’ah 
    marriage is not permitted” – what is meant by mut’ah marriage is marrying a 
    woman for a period of time, such as saying: I give my daughter in marriage 
    for a month, or a year, or until the end of this season, or until the 
    pilgrims come back” and so on, whether the period is known or unknown. This 
    is an invalid marriage. This was stated by Ahmad who said: Mut’ah marriage 
    is haraam. This is the view of most of the Sahaabah and fuqaha’. Among those 
    from whom it was narrated that it is haraam are ‘Umar, ‘Ali, Ibn ‘Umar, Ibn 
    Mas’ood and Ibn al-Zubayr. Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said: The view that mut’ah is 
    haraam is held by Maalik, the people of Madeenah, Abu Haneefah among the 
    people of Iraq, al-Awzaa’i among the people of Syria, al-Layth among the 
    people of Egypt, al-Shaafa’i and all the ashaab al-athaar. End quote. 
It is not 
    permissible for anyone to undertake this haraam kind of marriage, or to bear 
    witness to it. 
The one who 
    has done that must repent to Allaah and the man and woman must be 
    separated. 
Secondly: 
There are 
    other kinds of mut’ah marriage which is where a man marries a woman on 
    condition that he will divorce her at a certain time. 
The 
    difference between the two forms is that in the first kind, it is agreed 
    that the marriage will last for a certain period of time, after which the 
    marriage will end with no need for talaaq divorce. 
In the 
    second kind, no specific time period is mentioned, but it is stipulated that 
    talaaq divorce will be issued at a certain time. 
Ibn Qudaamah 
    (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (7/137): 
“If he 
    marries her on the basis that he will divorce her at a specific time, the 
    nikaah is not valid.” This means that if he marries her on the basis that he 
    will divorce her at a certain time, the marriage is not valid, whether that 
    time is known or unknown, such as if he stipulates that he will divorce her 
    when her father or brother comes. 
Because this 
    condition negates the continuation of the marriage, and makes it like a 
    mut’ah marriage. End quote. 
The Standing 
    Committee was asked about a man who was travelling far from his homeland and 
    wanted to marry a woman, and they agreed that he would divorce her when he

Say: I seek refuge with (Allaah) the Lord of mankind,
2. The King of mankind —
3. The Ilaah (God) of mankind,

5. Who whispers in the hearts of mankind.
6. Of jinn and men.”
[al-Naas 114:1-6]
In these verses is the command to seek refuge with Allaah from the whisperer who withdraws, who whispers into the hearts of mankind. 
It also tells us how that whisperer is, that he may be from among the jinn or he may be from among mankind. Al-Hasan said: both are devils; the devil from among the jinn whispers into people’s hearts, and the devil from among mankind comes openly. 
Qataadah said: among the jinn are devils and among mankind are devils, so seek refuge with Allaah from the devils of mankind and the jinn. 
This is the correct meaning of this verse. 
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:  
The correct view concerning the meaning of this verse is that the words “Of jinn and men” refer to the waswaas or whisper; there are two kinds of waswaas, one which comes from the jinn and one which comes from humans. The jinni whispers into the hearts of man and the human also whispers into the hearts of man… 
Similar to their having this whispering in common is the fact that they have devilish inspiration in common too. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And so We have appointed for every Prophet enemies — Shayaateen (devils) among mankind and jinn, inspiring one another with adorned speech as a delusion (or by way of deception)”
[al-An’aam 6:112]
The Shaytaan whispers his falsehood to a human being and the human being conveys it to other humans like him, so the devils of mankind and the jinn both share in the devilish inspiration and in the whispering… 
The verse indicates that we should seek refuge with Allaah from the evil of both types of devils – the devils among mankind and the devils among the jinn. End quote. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in Tafseer Juz’ ‘Amma: 
The words “Of jinn and men” refer to the whispers that may come from the jinn or may come from the sons of Adam. 
The whispers of the jinn are clear, because they flow through the son of Adam like his blood.
 The whispers of the sons of Adam often come to a person and inspire him to do evil, making it appear attractive to him until these ideas gain control of him and he acts upon them. End quote.

My question is about their requirements (what I give them each month is 15,000 and their inheritance that I am keeping for them is 400,000). I have debts for 4 years because of building. Which is better – putting pressure on myself and my children for a little while or taking some money to cover gas costs etc (because of the visits) without their knowledge?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Islam regards taking an orphan’s wealth unlawfully as one of the seven sins that doom one to Hell – as it was narrated by al-Bukhaari (2615) and Muslim (89) from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), because it is a great trust which many are unable to fulfil. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to Abu Dharr, when advising him: “And do not take care of the property of an orphan.” Narrated by Muslim (1826).  
Islam commands the one who has orphans under his care to look after them properly and raise them well, and if they have wealth he is to guard it and invest it, and pay zakaah on it. If he is rich then it is better for him to refrain from touching their wealth at all, and if he is poor he may consume some on a reasonable basis; if he invests their money he may take payment equal to that of anyone else doing a similar job. These are the rulings of sharee’ah, and they are most wise and just. 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And give not unto the foolish your property which Allah has made a means of support for you, but feed and clothe them therewith, and speak to them words of kindness and justice.
6. And try orphans (as regards their intelligence) until they reach the age of marriage; if then you find sound judgement in them, release their property to them, but consume it not wastefully and hastily fearing that they should grow up, and whoever (amongst guardians) is rich, he should take no wages, but if he is poor, let him have for himself what is just and reasonable (according to his labour). And when you release their property to them, take witness in their presence; and Allah is All‑Sufficient in taking account” [al-Nisa’ 4:5, 6]
Ibn Katheer said:  
In the words, “consume it not wastefully and hastily fearing that they should grow up”, Allah forbids consuming orphans’ wealth unnecessarily. “wastefully and hastily” means hastening before they reach puberty. Then Allah says: “and whoever (amongst guardians) is rich, he should take no wages” meaning, he should not consume anything from it. Al-Sha’bi said: For him it is like dead meat and blood [i.e., forbidden]. “but if he is poor, let him have for himself what is just and reasonable (according to his labour)”. This was revealed concerning the guardian of an orphan who looks after him and takes care of him, if he needs to take from it. It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah said: This verse was revealed concerning the guardian of an orphan: “and whoever (amongst guardians) is rich, he should take no wages, but if he is poor, let him have for himself what is just and reasonable (according to his labour)”.  
The fuqaha’ said: He may take whichever is the lesser amount – the equivalent wages for his work or as much as he needs. They differed as to whether he should repay it if he becomes well off. There are two views, one of which is that he should not, because he took it in return for his work when he was poor. This is the correct view according to the companions of al-Shaafa’i, because the verse allows taking without replacing it later on. 
The other view is that yes, he should repay it, because the orphan’s wealth is forbidden, and it was only permitted because of need, so he should repay it just as if he took wealth from someone else when he was in need. 
“and whoever (amongst guardians) is rich, he should take no wages” means, whoever among guardians. “but if he is poor” also refers to guardians. “let him have for himself what is just and reasonable” means, in the way that is better, just as it says in another verse, “And come not near to the orphan’s property, except to improve it, until he (or she) attains the age of full strength” [al-An’aam 6:152], i.e., do not come near it except with the intention of disposing of it in the best way, and if you need it then use it in a way that is just and reasonable.""(Tafseer Ibn Katheer  1/454, 455). 
It was narrated from ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr that a man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: “I am poor, I do not have anything, and I have an orphan (under my care).” He said: “Eat from the wealth of your orphan, without being extravagant or wasteful or using it for trade.” Narrated by Abu Dawood (2872), al-Nasaa’i (3668) and Ibn Maajah (2718). Classed as hasan by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Jaami’ (4497). 
If you want to take money in return for what you do for them, taking care of their interests, and this work of yours deserves payment, then there is no sin on you for that. But if you want to take payment for visiting them, you should not do that, because the costs of visiting orphans are not usually paid for from their own wealth. This is unlike what you spend on them for clothing, furnishings and food, which may be paid for from their wealth. 
As you are in a country where there are shar’i courts, you must refer to what sharee’ah says about that, so that the judge may rule as he sees fit in the orphan’s interests. And Allah knows best. 
We hope that you will think long and hard about the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) as narrated by al-Bukhaari (1400) and Muslim (1053): “…whoever refrains from asking, Allah will make him content, whoever seeks to be independent of means, Allah will make him independent, and whoever is patient Allah will bestow patience upon him, and no one is ever given anything better and more generous than patience.” Thus you will realize that the way to pay off your debt is by refraining from asking, seeking to be independent of means and being patient. 
Al-Mubaarakfoori said: 
“Whoever seeks to be independent of means” means he shows himself to be independent and having no need of people’s wealth, and refraining from asking so that one who is ignorant of his situation would think that he is independent of means and has no need to ask. 
“Allah will make him independent” means by making him content. In the hadeeth it says: “Richness does not mean having a lot, rather richness is contentment.” Or it means that He will give him that which will make him have no need of people. 
“whoever refrains from asking” means seeking to refrain from that which is haraam and from asking of people. i.e., whoever wants to be content refrain from asking of people, Allah will grant that to him. 
“Allah will make him content” means, He will prevent him from falling into that which is forbidden, i.e., whoever is content with the least of provision and refrains from asking, contentment will be made easy for him, and this is a treasure. 
“whoever is patient” means, seeks the support of patience from Allah, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And endure you patiently (O Muhammad), your patience is not but from Allah” [al-Nahl 16:127]. Or: tells himself to be patient and is ready to carry the burden of patience. 
“Allah will bestow patience upon him” means: He will make patience easy for him.""(Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi  6/143, 144).

59934,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/59934,What is the difference between protecting oneself and avoiding in the hadeeth about the two who were being punished in their graves?,"In Saheeh al-Bukhaari it is narrated that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) passed by two graves, he said: “They are being punished, but they are not being punished for something that was difficult to avoid,” or as he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said. Then he said, “No, one of them used not to protect himself from his urine, and the other used to walk around spreading malicious gossip.” 
The same hadeeth is also narrated in Saheeh Muslim, and according to another version narrated by Muslim, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “… and the other one did not avoid urine.” 
My question is: 
What is meant by protecting himself and by avoiding? What is the difference between them? How can we reconcile these two reports?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.This hadeeth was narrated by al-Bukhaari (216) and Muslim (292) from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) passed by one of the gardens of Madeenah or Makkah, and he heard the sound of two persons being punished in their graves. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “They are being punished, but they are not being punished for anything that was difficult to avoid.” Then he said, “No. One of them used not to protect himself from his urine, and the other used to walk around spreading malicious gossip.” Then he called for a palm leaf, which he split in two and put one piece on each grave. It was said to him, “O Messenger of Allaah, why did you do that?’ He said, “May their punishment be reduced so long as this does not dry out (or until this dries out).” 
According to a report narrated by Muslim: “he did not avoid urine.” 
According to a version narrated by al-Nasaa’i, “he did not take care to avoid his urine”. this was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Nasaa’i. 
Al-Nawawi said: 
The words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “he used not to protect himself from his urine.” Three versions have been narrated: “used not to protect himself”, “did not avoid urine” and “did not take care to avoid urine”. All of them are saheeh, and they all mean that he did not take precautions to avoid getting urine on himself. 
Sharh Muslim, 3/201 
Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajr said: 
It appears as “used not to protect himself from his urine” in most of the reports. In a report narrated by Ibn ‘Asaakir, it says, “he did not take care to avoid his urine”.   
According to Muslim and Abu Dawood, in the hadeeth of al-A’mash, it says, “he did not avoid urine.” 
The version narrated by the majority means that he did not use something to shield himself from his urine, i.e., he did not protect himself from it. This is in agreement with the report which says that “he did not take care to avoid his urine” In al-Mustakhraj, Abu Na’eem narrated via Wakee’ from al-A’mash, “He did not avoid urine”. This explains what is meant. Some of them interpreted it according to its apparent meaning and said: i.e., he did not cover his ‘awrah. 
The report which says, “he did not avoid urine” reflects a higher level of avoidance. 
Ibn Daqeeq al-Eid said: If istitaar (translated above as protecting oneself from urine) is interpreted as meaning that he did not cover his ‘awrah, that is the reason for the punishment mentioned. But the context of the hadeeth indicates that there is a specific connection between urine and the punishment in the grave, as is indicated by the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah which Ibn Khuzaymah classed as saheeh: “Most of the punishment of the grave is because of urine” – i.e., because of failing to take precautions against it getting it on one's clothes and body. The primary reason for the punishment is because of urine. If we interpret it as meaning uncovering the ‘awrah, this sense is lost. Therefore we should interpret it as referring to urine, not the ‘awrah, so that all the ahaadeeth may be interpreted in one way. This is supported by the fact that in the hadeeth of Abu Bakrah which is narrated by Ahmad and Ibn Maajah, it says: “One of them is being punished because of urine.” Al-Tabaraani narrated a similar hadeeth from Anas. 
Fath al-Baari, 1/318. 
Al-San’aani said: 
Then he stated that the punishment of one of them was because he did not protect himself against urine, i.e., he did not put some shield between himself and his urine to prevent it getting on him, or because he did not take care to avoid his urine, or he did not avoid urine. All these phrases are mentioned in the reports, and all may be understood as meaning that it is forbidden to touch urine or not take precautions to avoid it. 
Subul al-Salaam, 1/119, 120 
Conclusion: 
The phrases mentioned in the saheeh reports – he did not protect himself against urine, he did not take care to avoid his urine, he did not avoid urine – all mean the same thing, as stated above in the comments of the imams.

59936,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/59936,Is it permissible to delay paying the price of gold and the cost of having it made into jewellery?,"Is it permissible to give some money to a craftsman to make jewellery on the basis that the rest will be given to him when he finishes it, knowing that the first amount is not being used to buy the gold?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    What we understand from the question is that you are going to 
    buy the gold from this craftsman, and he will make it into jewellery. If 
    that is the case, it is not permissible, rather what you should do is pay 
    the price of the gold (in cash) and take possession of the gold in one 
    sitting. As for the cost of making it into jewellery, it is permissible to 
    delay it. 

    But if what is meant in the question is that you are going to 
    give the craftsman gold that you already own, so that he can make it into 
    jewellery, then there is nothing wrong with delaying payment. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    It is proven that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “Gold for gold, silver for silver, wheat for 
    wheat, barley for barley, dates for dates, salt for salt, like for like, 
    same for same, hand to hand.” 

    And it is proven that he  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) said: “Whoever gives more or asks for more has engaged in 
    riba.”  

    And it is proven that he  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) was brought some good-quality dates. He asked about them and 
    they said: “We used to take one saa’ for two saa’s, and two saa’s for 
    three.” The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) ordered 
    that the transaction be cancelled and he said, “This is the essence of 
    riba.” Then he told them to sell the inferior dates and to buy good-quality 
    dates with the dirhams. 

    From these ahaadeeth we may understand that what the 
    questioner said about exchanging gold for gold and adding the cost of making 
    one of them into jewellery is something that is forbidden and is not 
    permissible. It comes under the heading of riba which the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade. The correct way to do 
    it is to sell the broken gold for a certain price without any other 
    conditions. After the seller has taken the price, he may then buy the new 
    gold. It is better to look for the new gold in another place, and if he 
    cannot find it then he may return to the one who bought from him, and buy it 
    with dirhams. If it costs more it does not matter. What matters is that 
    there should not be an exchange of gold for gold with an extra payment, even 
    if that is for making it into jewellery. 

    This applies if the seller is a merchant. If the merchant is 
    also a goldsmith he can say: “Take this gold and make it into jewellery for 
    me (whatever he wants him to make), and I will pay you for that when you 
    finish making it.” There is nothing wrong with this. End quote.

It does not have to be

    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) took 
    hold of me by the neck from behind. I looked at him and he was smiling. He 
    said, “O Unays, did you go and do what I told you to?” I said, “Yes, I will 
    go, O Messenger of Allaah.” Anas said: By Allaah, I served him for nine 
    years and I never heard him say for anything that I did, “Why did you do 
    such and such?” or for something that I did not do, “Why did you not do such 
    and such?” 

    Al-Nawawi said: 

    With regard to the phrase “nine years” – most reports say ten 
    years. What this means is that it was nine years and some months. The 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stayed in Madeenah 
    for ten years exactly, no more and no less, and Anas started to serve him 
    during the first year. In the report which says nine years, the partial year 
    is not counted, rather the complete years are counted, and in the report 
    which says ten years, the partial year is counted as a full year. Both are 
    saheeh. 

    This hadeeth gives a clear picture of the good attitude, 
    kindness, forbearance and tolerance of the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him).   

    Sharh Muslim, 15/71 
The Sunnah describes the 
    rights which must be accorded to workers, employees and slaves who may be 
    under the authority of a Muslim. This universal sharee’ah brought something 
    that no divinely-revealed law had brought before, and no earthly legal 
    system had produced the like thereof, so the Muslim should feel proud of 
    belonging to this religion and should hasten to act in accordance with its 
    rulings. 

    It was narrated that al-Ma’roor ibn Suwayd said: I saw Abu 
    Dharr wearing a hullah (a suit of two garments) and his slave was 
    wearing something similar. I asked him about that and he said that he had 
    insulted a man at the time of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) by saying something disparaging about his 
    mother. The man went to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) and told him about that, and the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) said: “You are a man who still has something of 
    Jaahiliyyah in you. They are your brothers and servants whom Allaah has 
    placed under your authority. Anyone who has his brother under his authority, 
    let him feed him the same food as he eats and dress him in the same clothes 
    as he wears, do not overwhelm them with work and if you give them work to do 
    then help them with it.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 30; Muslim 1661. 

    Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said: 

    This hadeeth shows that it is forbidden to insult slaves or 
    speak disparagingly of those who bore them; we are encouraged to treat them 
    well and be kind to them. Although it speaks of slaves, that also includes 
    employees and others. 

    It also shows that we should not feel superior to another 
    Muslim or look down on him. 

    Fath al-Baari, 5/175 

    It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah says: ‘There are 
    three whose opponent I will be on the Day of Resurrection: a man who makes a 
    promise in My name then breaks his word, a man who sells a free man and 
    consumes his price, and a man who employs another and benefits from him (his 
    labour), then does not give him his wages.’” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2114. 

    From the ahaadeeth quoted above, it is possible to sum up the 
    rights of servants and the etiquette with which their employer or master 
    should treat them. These rights and etiquette are as follows: 

    1-He should give his servant the 
    same food as he eats

    2-He should clothe him as he 
    clothes himself.

    3-He should not give him more to 
    do than he is able for, and if he does that he should help him.

    4-He should pay him a wage that 
    is appropriate to his work and his efforts.

    5-He should not insult him or hit 
    him.

    6-He should treat him well and be 
    kind to him.

    7-He should overlook his mistakes 
    and shortcomings,

    Your mother should fear Allaah in her dealings with her 
    servants. She should remember that Allaah has more power over her than she 
    has over her servants, and that things do not always remain the same, she 
    cannot be sure that things will not change and that she will not lose 
    blessings because of such actions. Hence the wise Muslim should pay 
    attention to that, and be grateful for blessings so that Allaah may increase 
    them by His bounty. 

    Perhaps if your mother reads what we have quoted here of 
    ahaadeeth, rulings, etiquette and warnings, she will stop being so harsh 
    towards the servants and will repent to her Lord, and will ask forgiveness 
    from those whom she has wronged, and will treat them kindly, before there 
    comes a Day on which there will be no dirham and no dinar, rather it will be 
    the matter of good deeds and bad deeds. How many Muslims have exhausted 
    themselves doing acts of worship and good deeds in this world, but the 
    reward thereof is lost in the Hereafter because it is taken from them and 
    given to those against whom they transgressed in this world by insulting and 
    slandering them. 

    It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with 
    him) that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “Whoever has wronged his brother, let him seek forgiveness 
    from him for it –  because (on the Day of Resurrection) there will be no 
    dinar and no dirham – before some of his good deeds are taken and given to 
    his brother, and if he has no good deeds (to his credit) some of his 
    brother’s bad deeds will be taken and added to (his burden).” 

    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6169 

    It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with 
    him) that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “Do you know who the bankrupt one is?” They said, “Among us, 
    the one who is bankrupt is the one who has no money or goods.” He said: “The 
    one who is bankrupt among my ummah is the one who will come on the Day of 
    Resurrection with prayer, fasting and zakaah (to his credit), but he will 
    come having insulted this one, slandered that one, consumed the wealth of 
    this one, shed the blood of that one, beaten this one, so they will all be 
    given some of his good deeds, and if his good deeds run out before all the 
    scores are settled, then some of their bad deeds will be taken and thrown 
    onto him, then he will be thrown into the Fire.” Narrated by Muslim, 2581. 

    What you must do is to advise your mother and keep on doing 
    so; do not despair of her being guided or repenting. But that must be done 
    kindly and gently, paying attention to your mother’s rights, for her rights 
    are great. Do not worry if she gets angry with you, because she has no right 
    to do so. You will be rewarded if you bear her wrongs with patience. 

    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    was asked about a man who had a sum of money stolen and he thought that one 
    of his children had taken it. He started to pray against him and cut him 
    off, but he was innocent and had not taken anything. Would the son be 
    rewarded for his father’s prayers against him? 

    He replied: 

    Yes, if the son was wronged, for Allaah will expiate his sins 
    by means of the wrong that was done to him, and will reward him for his 
    patience; and the one who prays against another unjustly is sinning. End 
    quote.
