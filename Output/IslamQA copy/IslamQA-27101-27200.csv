27101,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/27101,Can Non-Muslims Pray?,May a non-Muslim pray in the ranks with Muslims? Please provide evidence for yes or no.,"It is not permissible for a non-Muslim to pray either in the ranks or on his own. What he has to do is to enter Islam before he prays, then to purify himself by doing ghusl and then fulfil the conditions of prayer.",,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for a non-Muslim to pray either in the ranks or on his own. What he has to do is to enter Islam before he prays , then to purify himself [by doing ghusl], and then fulfil the conditions of prayer. 
He is included in the obligation of prayer, and he is to be punished if he does not become Muslim and pray, but it will not be accepted from him unless he enters Islam. 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And nothing prevents their contributions from being accepted from them except that they disbelieved in Allah and in His Messenger (Muhammad).” [At-Tawbah 9:54] 
“If you join others in worship with Allah, (then) surely, (all) your deeds will be in vain, and you will certainly be among the losers.” [Az-Zumar 39:65]
Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said, when listing the conditions of prayer being valid: 
“There are other conditions which include: being Muslim, being of sound mind, and having reached the age of discretion… No act of worship is valid unless one is a Muslim, of sound mind and has reached the age of discretion, apart from Zakah, which is obligatory upon the insane and minors, according to the correct opinion. With regard to the validity of Hajj performed by a minor, there are texts which state that it is valid.” (Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti`, 2/95, Ibn Al-Jawzi edition) 
And he (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“The conditions of prayer are: being Muslim, being of sound mind, and having reached the age of discretion; that the time for prayer has begin; covering the `Awrah; having purified oneself from anything that invalidates Wudu’; avoiding Najasah (impurity); facing the Qiblah; and having the intention of praying.” (Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti`, 2/289, Ibn Al-Jawzi edition) 
The same applies to the other acts of worship; they can only be accepted from a Muslim, so Islam or being a Muslim is a condition of acts of worship being valid, and their being accepted depends on that. 
Ibn Rushd (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“The conditions fall into two categories: 
The conditions of it being valid , and the conditions of it being obligatory . With regard to the conditions of it being valid, there is no difference of scholarly opinion that they include being Muslim, because Hajj is not valid if done by one who is not a Muslim…” (Bidayat Al-Mujtahid, 1/133)

27104,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/27104,He talks about marriage secrets and gets married with the intention of divorcing the woman,"I'm married to a muslim to whom I'm losing trust.  We've been married for a few years. I knew him prior to marriage and I (we) did repent for that. But he has gone off on (2) different occasions to acquire a second wife. On both occasions the sisters that he married seemed more out of desire and assuming that things would be different with marrying a less than knowledgable individual that lack basic manners and deen. Even after knowing this at the time of marriage, he consumates then complains that he wants this second wife to have similar manners and deen as I do. My concern is that he has reveiled his past (I know that as muslims we should keep these things to ourselves) and he was married several times as a kafir, and cheated on these wives and now it seems that he's using Islam as a justification for doing this (having mutiple wives). He's says that he loves me, but I feel that he's just used to me and my good manners and resourcefulness, but he doesn't attempt to treat the second spouse the way he treats me. He is very open to tell me things about the second spouse that I don't want to hear.
Both marriages were seemed to be performed in a very sneaky and questionable manner. I don't have a enough space to go into the details. He has stated on occassions that he has to have a second wife. Is it allowed in Islam for a man to marry and divorce as many women as he wants (I know no more than 4 at one time), but one every few months, even if he's just marrying another woman for the purpose of having something different temporarily? With the intent of using one of her negative qualities as a reason for divorce? We do not have children. Am I allowed to request a divorce on the grounds that I cannot continue to cope with these situations and I'm losing the love and desire for my husband.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
It is obligatory for both spouses to keep the secrets of the marriage, especially anything that has to do with their intimate relationship in bed.  The wife is entrusted with the husband’s secrets and the husband is entrusted with the wife’s secrets. 
It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) turned to the men and said, “Is there any man among you who, when he comes to his wife, he locks the door, throws his blanket over himself and conceals himself with the cover of Allaah?” They said, “Yes.” He said, “And does he sit after that and say, ‘I did such and such, and I did such and such?’” They remained silent. Then he turned to the women and said, “Is there anyone among you who speaks (of private marital matters)?” They remained silent. Then a buxom young girl sat up tall so that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would see her and hear her words, and said, “O Messenger of Allaah, (the men) speak and (the women) speak.” He said, “Do you know what the likeness of that is? The likeness of that is that of a female devil who meets a male devil in the street and he fulfils his desire with her when the people are looking on.” 
Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2174. Classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 7037. 
Secondly: 
With regard to your husband’s other marriages, if that is for the purpose of “having a change” as you say, then this is marriage with the intention of divorcing, which is deceiving the woman and her guardians (walis). 
Shaykh Muhammad Rasheed Rida (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
The fact that the scholars of the earlier and later generations emphatically forbade mut’ah (temporary marriage) implies that marriage with the intention of divorce is haraam, even though the fuqaha’ said that a marriage contract is valid if the husband intends it to be temporary but did not state that as a condition in the marriage contract; but his concealing that is regarded as a betrayal and deceit, and this contract deserves to be annulled more than one in which he stipulated the condition that it be temporary with the agreement of the husband, the wife and the wife’s guardian. This leads to many evil consequences as it is abusing this great bond which is the greatest of human relationships, and going along with one’s whims and desires. When this condition is not stated clearly, that is cheating and betrayal which leads to other bad consequences such as enmity, hatred and loss of trust even of sincere people who want to get married in the real sense, which means protecting the chastity of both partners and cooperating in establishing a righteous home… 
Quoted from Fiqh al-Sunnah by al-Sayyid al-Saabiq, 2/39 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) spoke similar words on the prohibition of such marriages. He said: 
Moreover this view – the view that (such marriages) are permitted – may be exploited by those who are weak in faith for evil purposes, as we hear that some people have started to go on vacation, during time off from studies, to other countries to get married with the intention of divorcing soon. I have been told that some of them marry several wives on these trips, as if they go there only to satisfy their desires which are more like zina (adultery, fornication) – we seek refuge with Allaah.
Because of this we think that even if there is a view that it is permitted, it is not appropriate to open this door because it has becomes a means that leads to that which we have mentioned. 
With regard to my opinion on this matter, I say that this marriage contract is a valid contract, but it involves deceit and betrayal, so it may become haraam because of that. 
It is deceit and betrayal because the wife and her guardian, if they knew the intention of this husband, and that his intention is to enjoy intimacy with her and then divorce her, they would not adept this marriage. So in that sense he is deceiving and betraying them. 
If he tells them that he wants her to stay with him for the duration of his visit to that country, and they agree to that, then this marriage is mut’ah (temporary marriage). 
Hence I think that it is haraam, but if anyone goes ahead and does it, then the marriage contract is valid, but it involves sin. 
Liqa’ al-Baab al-Maftooh, Question 1391. 
But if he married you with the intention of making the marriage permanent, and he has no intention of divorce, but then something happens which is a reason for divorce, then there is no sin on him in that case. 
Thirdly: 
With regard to his getting married in secret, if that is in the presence of the woman’s guardian and two witnesses, and the marriage contract is done in that fashion, then it is a valid marriage. But if it is done without the woman’s guardian or without the presence of two witnesses, then the marriage is not valid. See questions no. 7989 and 2127. 
Fourthly: 
We advise your husband to fear Allaah with regard to his family, and to fear Him with regard to people’s honour. He should note that it is not permissible for him to fool about in this manner, for marriage is love, tranquility and compassion, so he should not make it merely a means of satisfying his desire and then abandon the woman.
We also advise you to be gentle in denouncing your husband, and to preserve the stability of the home, and be sure of what you mention about his intention in taking several wives and what you do not like about him. Remember that a woman’s jealousy towards co-wives may lead her to make mountains out of molehills, and the waswaas (whispers) of the Shaytaan may make it worse, with the aim of disrupting the stability of Muslim families. 
So look at the matter with a little wisdom, especially the matter of his intention, which you cannot really know. Ask Allaah to show you the truth of the matter, and pray istikhaarah with regard to either staying with him or asking for separation. Think about your situation if you get divorced and what the consequences of that would be, then decide whether it is better for you to leave him or to stay and put up with it.  If you cannot bear it because of the things you have mentioned, then you have the right to ask for separation.

27105,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/27105,What is the ruling on living with a kaafir mother?,What is the ruling on living with kafir mother and wanting to move your wife into the home with her?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.There is no reason why a son should not live with his kaafir mother, or her with him. That may be a means of her being guided to Islam, if the son treats her well and gives a good impression of Islam; keeping away from her may be a cause of her coming to Islam being delayed. 
The Muslim is enjoined to treat his parents well and honour them even if they are kuffaar. It is not permissible for a Muslim to disobey them or treat them badly in word and deed. But that does not mean that he should obey her in matters that are sinful or show approval of the kufr that she believes in. 
(a) Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And We have enjoined on man to be good and dutiful to his parents; but if they strive to make you join with Me (in worship) anything (as a partner) of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not. Unto Me is your return and I shall tell you what you used to do”
[al-‘Ankaboot 29:8]
(b) And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“But if they (both) strive with you to make you join in worship with Me others that of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not; but behave with them in the world kindly, and follow the path of him who turns to Me in repentance and in obedience. Then to Me will be your return, and I shall tell you what you used to do”
[Luqmaan 31:15] 
(c) It was narrated that Asma’ bint Abi Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: My mother came to me at the time of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and she was a mushrik. I asked the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about that, saying, “My mother has come to me and she wants to visit me; should I uphold the ties of kinship with her?” He said, “Yes, uphold the ties of kinship with your mother.”
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2477; Muslim, 1003) 
(d) It was narrated from Sa’d ibn Abi Waqqaas that a verse of Qur’aan was revealed concerning him. He said: Umm Sa’d swore that she should never speak to him until he gave up his religion, and she would never eat or drink. She said, “You claim that Allaah commands you to honour your parents, and I am your mother, and I am telling you to do this.” He said, She stayed like that for three days, until exhaustion overtook her, then one of her sons, whose name was ‘Amaarah, got up and gave her some water, and she started to pray against Sa’d. Then Allaah revealed Qur’aan (interpretation of the meaning):
“And We have enjoined on man to be good and dutiful to his parents; but if they strive to make you join with Me (in worship) anything (as a partner…”

And He said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“…but behave with them in the world kindly…”

Narrated by Muslim, 1748. 
(e) There follows a fatwa from Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) regarding the issue of obeying parents with regard to shaving the beard:
Question: Regarding obeying your father with regard to shaving the beard. 
The Shaykh replied: 
It is not permissible for you to obey your father in shaving the beard, rather you must let it grow, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Trim the moustache and let the beard grow; be different from the mushrikeen.” And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Obedience is only with regard to that which is good and proper.”
Letting the beard grow is obligatory, not just Sunnah, according to fiqhi terminology, because the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded that, and the basic principle is that a command is obligatory.

27107,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/27107,She is married to a Muslim and hijab is putting her off Islam,"My husbad is Muslim and has talked frequently about me becoming Muslim myself. I just have one concern... the women being covered. Why do they need to cover themselves and only reveal what is odinarily revealed. I am American, we reveal almost the entire body here. I just want to get an understanding.",,,"Praise be to Allah.There can be no doubt that Allaah only enjoins that in which there is wisdom, but in some cases the wisdom behind some rulings may be hidden from people, and in some cases it may be quite obvious – such as the prohibition on alcohol which clouds the mind and hinders people from the remembrance of Allaah and from prayer [cf. al-Maa'idah 5:91]. 
The wisdom behind the prescription of hijab is one of the most clear, because it is a covering for woman and guards their chastity, and it prevents the foolish from making approaches and harassing them. How often has a woman’s hijab prevented the devils among mankind from harrassing her? How often have unveiled women made a display of their beauty and charms, which has led to their being harrassed by the foolish? Concerning this, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks (veils) all over their bodies (i.e. screen themselves completely except the eyes or one eye to see the way). That will be better, that they should be known (as free respectable women) so as not to be annoyed. And Allaah is Ever Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful”
[al-Ahzaab 33:59]
This verse gives the complete answer to your question, because Allaah mentions here the command to His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to tell his wives and daughters and the believing women to wear hijab, and it mentions the wisdom behind that, which is so that they may be protected and not exposed to annoyance. 
When women go out showing most of their bodies – as the questioner mentions – this is one of the greatest causes of crime and corruption of men’s morals, and of the spread of immorality. It is also degrading for woman, as we see women becoming cheap products for business-owners and advertisers, who show woman half-naked and devoid of modesty in order to attract customers and market their products. 
A woman’s body belongs to her and is not to be shared with people. When she gets married it belongs to her husband and she should not let anyone else have a share in it. What does a woman want when she shows her body and exposes her charms to onlookers? Does she just want them to look and stare, and what is the affect of that on rapists and the foolish? How are you going to stop them from getting what they want by attacking you and trying to rape you. Are you going to show some meat to the hungry and then try to stop them from eating it? 
In a modern study it was shown that: 
65% of female workers are exposed to sexual harassment in their place of work in some European countries. 
18% of women in America have been raped or been subjected to attempted rape at some stage in their lives. 
More than half of victims were under the age of 17. 
Kitaab Ihsaa’aat, Diraasaat, Arqaam (p. 140). 
Islamic sharee’ah brought that which is best for men and for women, and for the family and society. It does not impose restrictions on women as some enemies of Islam claim. Islam allows women to work, seek knowledge, engage in business, testify in court, uphold the ties of kinship, visit the sick, and so on, but it has set limits regarding her going out in order to protect her and to prevent the foolish from harassing her. 
We say to the questioner: 
Many western women, when they think about it and come to know the reality of Allaah’s laws concerning women, do not hesitate to declare their Islam and enter into the religion of the Prophets and the righteous. 
In Islam, women are protected and looked after. That is not in return for her staying in the home only, rather that is because she plays a great role, which is taking care of her husband and raising and caring for children. This is an important role, because the soundness or corruption of society depends on the extent to which mothers are successful in their raising and teaching of their children. 
One of the largest British insurance companies carried out a study on one million housewives, which produced amazing results. This study showed that the average full-time housewife spends 19 hours per day meeting the needs of her family, because she is the one who is raising the children, teaching them, looking after family members when they fall sick, and is responsible for the household budget. 
In addition to that – looking at what the houswife’s value from a purely materialistic point of view, far removed from any emotional criteria – a woman who stays at home is the most valuable thing the family can have. 
Op. cit., p. 118, 119 
It has become clear to many wise women the serious danger posed by the false freedom that they are enjoying and they have finally realized where this path will lead them. It is stated in another study that: 
80% of American women think that the freedom that women have gained in the last 30 years is the reason for the promiscuity and violence that are prevalent nowadays.  
75% feel worried about the loss of values and the disintegration of the family. 
80% have great difficulty in combining their responsibilities at work with their responsibilities towards their husbands and children. 
87% said that if the clock was turned back they would consider the demands for equality as a social conspiracy against the United States and they would resist those who raise the banner of equality. 
op. cit., p. 147 
All it needs is for you to think about the matter a little, and look at real life, and you will see that hijab spares women from evil, harm and crimes. Islam has closed the door to such evils with its laws, including the requirement for women past the age of puberty to wear hijab. 
Finally we would like to congratulate you on the fact that Allaah has granted you a Muslim husband, so that you will be able to see Islam in practice from him and his Muslim relatives, which may encourage you to enter Islam and which may remove the barrier of fear about entering this great and purely monotheistic religion. Also note that entering this final religion, which Allaah wants for all people, is a great honour of which you may be deprived if you delay and death then overtakes you. So hasten to enter Islam, with submission to the will of Allaah, with eagerness and delighting in this blessing of Allaah.  
You should note that if you fall short in your observance of hijab because your human weakness or you feel embarrassed in front of your people, this is regarded as a sin. That should not prevent you from doing the great good deed which will lead you to Paradise and save you from Hell, namely embracing Islam. You should also note that the Shaytaan (Satan) is the enemy of all the sons of Adam, and he is the one who is stirring up these doubts in order to prevent you from entering this religion, so that he can increase the number of those who will follow him to Hell. So be strong and courageous in making the decision that will lead to eternal happiness, by Allaah’s leave. We ask Allaah to help you and to give you the will power to enter Islam as our sister in Islam, and to share this blessing. We thank you for your confidence in us.

    their desires and who put obedience to Allaah and His Messenger above obedience to their own desires, and fear the standing before their Lord. 
We give you glad tiding for what you have 
    done by leaving this girl and putting love of Allaah above this sin. There follow some glad tidings: 
1 – The reward of two Gardens.
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“But for him who fears the standing before 
    his Lord, there will be two Gardens (i.e. in Paradise)”
[al-Rahmaan 55:46]
 Ibn Katheer said:  
The correct view is that this verse is 
    general in meaning, as Ibn ‘Abbaas and others said. Allaah says “But for him who fears the standing before his Lord” 
    i.e., on the Day of Resurrection, and forbids himself from following his whims and desires, and does not obey his desires or prefer the life of 
    this world, and knows that the Hereafter is better and more lasting, and fulfils his duties towards Allaah, and avoids that which He has forbidden 
    – on the Day of Resurrection he will have two Gardens with his Lord… 
Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 
    4/277 
2 – Bad deeds will be turned into good 
    deeds.
Allaah says – after mentioning the punishment 
    for shirk, murder and adultery – (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Except those who repent and believe (in 
    Islamic Monotheism), and do righteous deeds; for those, Allaah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful”
[al-Furqaan 25:70]
According to the two views on the meaning of this verse, this is one of the glad tidings to 
    those who give up sin. And it was said that their sins will be turned into acts of obedience, and it was said that their bad deeds themselves will 
    be turned into good deeds. 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Sa’di said: 
“Except those who 
    repent” from these sins and others, by giving them up immediately, regretting what they have done in the past, and 
    resolving firmly never to go back to them. 
“and believe” 
    in Allaah with true faith, which implies giving up sin and doing acts of obedience. 
“and do righteous 
    deeds” means those that are enjoined by sharee’ah, if the intention is to seek the pleasure of Allaah. 
“for those, Allaah 
    will change their sins into good deeds” means, he will make their deeds different, so where they used to do bad deeds, 
    they will now do good deeds. So their shirk is changed into faith, their disobedience into obedience. The bad deeds that they used to do, from 
    which they repented, turning to Allaah, and worship, are turned into good deeds, as is the apparent meaning of the verse. This was narrated in the 
    hadeeth of the man some of whose sins were counted by Allaah, then He turned each bad deed into a good deed and he said, “O Lord, I have other bad 
    deeds that I do not see here.” And Allaah knows best. 
Tafseer al-Sa’di. 
3 – Feeling the sweetness of faith.
It was narrated from Anas ibn Maalik (may 
    Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There are three qualities, whoever possesses 
    them will find the sweetness of faith: when Allaah and His Messenger are dearer to him than anyone else; when he loves a man and only loves him 
    for the sake of Allaah; and when he would hate to go back to kufr as he would hate to be thrown into the fire.” 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 16; Muslim, 43. 
4 – Glad tidings of sincerity
Undoubtedly for those who strive against 
    their whims and desires and ward off haraam love and replace it with love of Allaah, this is a sign of their sincerity (ikhlaas). 
Ibn al-Qayyim said: 
Love of images [i.e. haraam love] is 
    something which is suffered by those hearts that are devoid of love of Allaah. If the heart is filled with love of Allaah and longing to meet Him, 
    that will ward off the sickness of love of images. Hence Allaah said concerning Yoosuf (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Thus it was, that We might turn away from 
    him evil and illegal sexual intercourse. Surely, he was one of Our chosen, (guided) slaves”
[Yoosuf 12:24]
This indicates that his being chosen was the reason why (haraam) love and its consequences of 
    evil and illegal sexual intercourse were warded off from him. One of the salaf said: “Love is the movement of an empty heart” i.e., a heart that 
    is empty of everything except the object of love.
And Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 
“And the heart of the mother of Moosa 
    (Moses) became empty [from every thought, except the thought of Moosa (Moses)]. She was very near to disclose his (case, i.e. the child is her 
    son)”
[al-Qasas 28:10]
i.e., her heart was empty of everything except Moosa, because of her deep love for him and her 
    heart’s attachment to him. Love is composed of two things: admiring the object of one’s love, and hoping to get what one wants. When one of them 
    ends then the love ends too. 
Zaad al-Ma’aad, 
    4/268. 
Strive – may Allaah bless you – to strengthen 
    your faith and to persist in obeying and worshipping Allaah, because that is one of the greatest signs of love of Allaah. Try to continue having 
    no contact with that girl, then the Shaytaan will not trick you into going back to her and speaking to her. Then you will be fine, in sha Allah.

The torment will be doubled to him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace; Except those who repent and believe (in Islamic Monotheism), and do righteous deeds; for those, Allah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
And whosoever repents and does righteous good deeds; then verily, he repents towards Allah with true repentance.” [al-Furqan 25:68-71]
It was narrated from ‘Ubadah ibn al-Samit (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Give me your oath of allegiance and your pledge that you will not associate anything in worship with Allah, or steal, or commit adultery, or kill your children, or utter slander, intentionally forging falsehood (i.e. by making illegal children belonging to their husbands) [cf. al-Mumtahanah 60:12], or disobey with regard to anything that is good. Whoever among you fulfils this pledge, Allah will reward him, and whoever does any of these things and is punished in this world, that will be an expiation for him. Whoever does any of these things and Allah conceals it for him, then it is up to Allah: if He wills He will forgive him and if He wills He will punish him.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 18; Muslim, 1709. 
In Sahih Muslim (1695) it says that when Ma’iz came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and confessed that he had committed zina and said, “Purify me (i.e., carry out the hadd punishment on me)”, he said to him, “Woe to you, go back and ask Allah for forgiveness and repent to Him.” 
Al-Nawawi said: 
“This hadith indicates that the burden of sin is lifted from one who repents from major sins , and this is according to the consensus of the Muslims.” 
Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar said: 
“From this case – i.e. the case of Ma’iz when he confessed zina – it may be understood that it is mustahabb for the one whose case is similar to repent to Allah and to conceal himself and not mention his sin to anyone… This was affirmed by al-Shafi'i who said: I prefer for the one who has committed a sin and been concealed by Allah to conceal it himself and to repent.” (Fath al-Bari, 12/124, 125) 
And it was narrated from ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Avoid these sins that Allah has forbidden, but whoever does any of them, let him conceal himself with the concealment of Allah and repent to Allah, for whoever tells us of what he has done, we will carry out (the punishment prescribed in) the Book of Allah on him.” 
It was also narrated by al-Hakim in al-Mustadrak ‘ala al-Sahihayn (4/425) and by al-Bayhaqi (8/330); classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami’, 149.

27120,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/27120,Should he give priority to Hajj or to getting married?,"Which is more important for a person, to go for Hajj with the money that he has, or to use it to get married? Because current times are times of temptation which make a man fear for himself.",,,"Praise be to Allah.If a man needs to get married, and it will be 
    too difficult for him to delay that, then he should give marriage precedence over Hajj. 
But if he does not need to get married, then 
    he should give precedence to Hajj. 
Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    said in al-Mughni (5/12): 
If he needs to get married and he fears that it will be too 
    difficult for him otherwise, then he should give priority to that, because it is obligatory for him and he cannot do without it, so it becomes 
    part of his essential spending. But he has no such fears, then he should give priority to Hajj, because marriage is voluntary and should not take 
    precedence over Hajj which is obligatory. 
See also al-Majmoo’ (7/71) by 
    al-Nawawi. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy 
    on him) was asked: 
Is it permissible to delay Hajj until after 
    marriage for one who is able to do it? That is because of the temptations both great and small that young men are faced with these days. 
He replied: 
Undoubtedly marriage when one has a strong 
    desire for it takes precedence over Hajj, because if a man has a strong desire to get married, in his case marriage is a necessity of life for 
    him, and is like food and drink. Hence it is permissible for the one who needs to get married and does not have money to be given some of the 
    zakaah funds in order to get married, just as a poor man may be given food and clothing to cover his ‘awrah from the zakaah. 
On this basis we say: If he needs to get 
    married, then he should give marriage precedence over Hajj, because Allaah has stated that one of the conditions of Hajj being obligatory is that 
    one is able to afford it. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah) to the 
    House (Ka‘bah) is a duty that mankind owes to Allaah, those who can afford the expenses (for one’s conveyance, provision and residence)”
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:97]
But if he is a young man and it does not matter to him if he gets 
    married this year or next year, then he should give precedence for Hajj because marriage is not a priority for him.

The fact that his prayers are not accepted does not mean that they are not valid, or that he should give up praying, rather it means that he will not be rewarded for them.",,"Praise be to Allah.There are many authentic Hadiths concerning the punishment for one who drinks alcohol which say that his prayers will not be accepted for forty days. This was narrated from `Amr ibn Al-`As, Ibn `Abbas, Ibn `Umar and Ibn `Amr (may Allah be pleased with them). (See As-Silsilah As-Sahihah, 709, 2039, 2695, 1854)
One of these Hadiths was narrated by Ibn Majah (3377) from `Abdullah ibn `Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever drinks alcohol and gets drunk, his prayer will not be accepted for forty days and if he dies he will go to Hell. But if he repents, Allah will accept his repentance. If he again drinks alcohol and gets drunk, his prayer will not be accepted for forty days and if he dies he will go to Hell. But if he repents, Allah will accept his repentance. If he again drinks alcohol and gets drunk, his prayer will not be accepted for forty days and if he dies he will go to Hell. But if he repents, Allah will accept his repentance. If he commits (this sin) again, then Allah pledges to make him drink the mud of Khabal on the Day of Resurrection.” They asked, “O Messenger of Allah, what is the mud of Khabal?” He said, “The juices of the people of Hell.” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah) 
The fact that his prayers are not accepted does not mean that they are not valid, or that he should give up praying, rather it means that he will not be rewarded for them. 
So the benefit of praying will be that he will have discharged his duty and will not be punished for not doing it. 
Abu `Abdullah ibn Mandah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The words “his prayer will not be accepted” mean that he will not be rewarded for his prayer for forty days, as a punishment for his drinking alcohol , just as they say that the one who speaks on Friday when the Imam is delivering the Khutbah should pray Jumu`ah but there is no Jumu`ah for him, meaning that he will not be given the reward for Jumu`ah as a punishment for his sin.” (Ta`thim Qadr As-Salah, 2/587, 588) 
An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“With regard to his prayer not being accepted, what this means is that he will not be rewarded for it, even though it is valid in the sense that he has discharged his duty and does not need to repeat it.” 
No doubt the person who drinks alcohol still has to perform the prayers on time. If he were to delay any of his prayers , he would be committing a grave major sin, which is worse than the sin of drinking alcohol . 
This punishment for drinking alcohol applies to the one who does not repent. But if he repents to Allah and turns to Him, He will accept his repentance and accept his good deeds, as it says in the Hadith quoted above: “… but if he repents, Allah will accept his repentance.” And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The one who repents from sin is like one who did not commit sin.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah, 4250; classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah)

After i crossed 15 he stopped. this has been troubling me for a long time. i never mentioned about this to anyone. sometimes i cry thinking about it. is their any dua that would help me here. one thing i know is i didn't commit any sin here expect for not telling my parents. and Allah knows how much this incident has affected my soul..,,,"Praise be to Allah.Undoubtedly what your uncle did  is a crime 
    that deserves punishment in this world and torment in the Hereafter. Many people’s religious conscience has been weakened by what they see and 
    read, which provokes their desire, so they fulfil their desires in ways that Allaah has forbidden. One of the most abhorrent and evil examples of 
    that is incest between a man and his mahrams (female relatives to whom marriage is forbidden), which is deserving of a severe punishment in the 
    Hereafter. 
Your mistake was not telling anyone in your 
    family so that they could put a stop to what this uncle was doing. But because that is in the past and has now ended, and you hated the situation 
    from the outset, there is no sin on you now. 
You have to try to forget the evil thing that 
    he did, and learn a lesson from it for the future, for yourself and your children. We advise you to pray to Allaah and ask Him to relieve you of 
    your worry and take away your distress. Some du’aa’s that have been narrated in the Sunnah are as follows: 

    (a)
    It was narrated that Anas ibn Maalik said: The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to say:
“Allaahumma inni a’oodhu bika min al-hamm 
    wa’l-hazn wa’l-‘ajz wa’l-kasal wa’l-bukhl wa’l-jubn wa dala’ al-dayn wa ghalbat al-rijaal (O Allaah, I seek refuge with You from distress, 
    grief, incapacity, laziness, miserliness, cowardice, the burden of debt and from being overpowered by men).” 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6008. 
Ibn Hajar said: 
The interpretation of these things is: 
    “distress” means bad things that the mind imagines are happening at present; “grief” for what has happened in the past; “incapacity” is the 
    opposite of ability; “laziness” is the opposite of being energetic; “miserliness” is the opposite of generosity; “cowardice” is the opposite of 
    courage. 
Fath al-Baari. 

    (b)
    It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “There is no-one who is afflicted by distress and grief, and says: ‘Allaahumma inni ‘abduka ibn ‘abdika ibn amatija naasyati bi yadika, maada 
    fiyya hukmuka, ‘adlun fiyya qadaa’uka. As’aluka bi kulli ismin huwa laka sammayta bihi nafsaka aw anzaltahu fi kitaabika aw ‘allamtahu ahadan min

    Your decree over me is just. I ask You by every name belonging to You which You have named Yourself with, or revealed in Your Book, or You taught 
    to any of Your creation, or You have preserved in the knowledge of the Unseen with You, that You make the Qur’aan the life of my heart and the 
    light of my breast, and a departure for my sorrow and a release for my anxiety),’ but Allaah will take away his distress and grief, and replace it 
    with joy.” He was asked: “O Messenger of Allaah, should we learn this?” He said: “Of course; everyone who hears it should learn it.”

But with regard to the one who takes that 
    money: if he let his beard grow in order to take the prize, then he will not be rewarded for his action, but if the prize motivated him to fulfil 
    the command of Allaah, or if he started because of the prize and then changed his intention after that and adhered to (following the ruling), then 
    he will be rewarded for that in which his intention was sound, and it will not matter that at first he was doing it for the prize.

I had humbly and kindly explained to them this:

    children and was suffering from numerous problems is an action for which you deserve to be praised and rewarded, especially since she is 
    religiously-committed as seems to be the case from your question. 
Islam encourages the one who wants to get 
    married to look for a woman who is religiously-committed, for she is the best kind of wife he can have. She will keep herself and her husband 
    chaste, and raise his children in the manner that Allaah likes. She will obey her husband and not disobey him. Marriage to a virgin is encouraged 
    in sharee’ah and is better than marrying a previously-married woman, but the previously-married woman may have characteristics that make her 
    better than a virgin, such as if marriage to her serves a purpose that cannot be met by marrying a virgin, or if her religious commitment and 
    attitude is better than that of a virgin. 
Al-Bukhaari (4052) and Muslim (715) narrated that Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah said: The Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to me: “Have you got married, O Jaabir?” I said, “Yes.” He said, “To a virgin or to a 
    previously-married woman?” I said, “To a previously-married woman, O Messenger of Allaah.” He said, “Why not a young girl with whom you could play 
    and she could play with you?” I said, “My father was killed on the day of Uhud, and he left behind nine daughters. I did not like to bring to them 
    someone like them, and I wanted to bring a woman who could look after them and guide them.” He said, “May Allaah bless you,” or he said good words 
    to me. According to one report he said, “You did the right thing.” And according to a version narrated by Muslim, “Then that is better. For women 
    may be married for their religious commitment, their wealth or their beauty. Choose the one who is religiously committed, may your hands be rubbed 
    with dust (i.e., may you prosper).” 
Al-Shawkaani said in Nayl al-Awtaar 
    (6/126): 
This indicates that it is mustahabb to marry 
    virgins, except for one who has a reason to marry a previously-married woman, as happened in the case of Jaabir. End quote. 
Al-Sindi said: 
“Then that is better” means, what you did by 
    marrying a previously-married woman is better or is good. End quote. 
So you have done well by marrying this woman, 
    and what people say should not matter to you after that. You have done what the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did, for 
    most of his wives had been previously married. 
It is not essential for your parents to agree 
    with your marriage, especially if their objections are for the reasons you mentioned. We have previously quoted in the answer to question no.
    21052 the fatwa of Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Humayyid concerning this matter, so 
    please read it as it is important. 
You have to repent and seek Allaah’s 
    forgiveness for being harsh towards your parents. You have to be gentle with them and try to please them. You can argue with them in the way that 
    is better so as to convince them, and in this way you can combine two things: marrying whom you want and pleasing your parents, which is

These four points are: the abhorrent nature of the sin of homosexuality; the damaging effects it has on health; the greatness of Allah’s mercy to those who repent; and ways of dealing with this problem. 
1 – The abhorrent nature of the sin of homosexuality
Ibn al-Qayyim said concerning the people of Loot: 
Those who support the first view – who are the majority of the ummah, and more than one narrated that there was consensus among the Sahaabah on this point – said that there is no sin that causes more corruption than the sin of homosexuality. It is second only to the sin of kufr, and may be greater than the sin of murder, as we shall see below in sha Allah. 
They said: Allah did not test anyone with this major sin before the people of Loot, and He punished them with a punishment that he did not send upon any other nation. He sent upon them various kinds of punishment: they were destroyed, their houses were turned upside down, the earth swallowed them up, they were pelted with stones from the sky, their eyes were blinded, they were tormented and their torment was made ongoing. So they were punished severely in a way that no other nation was punished, and that was because of the evilness of this crime which almost causes the earth to shake when it is done on it; and the angels flee to the ends of the heavens and the earth when they witness it, fearing that the punishment may come upon its people and strike them too; and the earth cries out to its Lord, and the mountains almost collapse. 
Killing the one to whom it is done would be better for him than having intercourse with him, for if a man has intercourse with him he corrupts him in such a way that life is no longer worth living, unlike killing him in a real sense, in which case he would be a martyr who had been wronged, which may be of benefit to him in the Hereafter. 
And he said: 
The companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) agreed unanimously that he should be put to death, and none of them disagreed about that. Rather they differed with regard to the manner in which he should be put to death. Some of the people thought that the difference of opinion had to do with whether [the homosexual] should be executed, and they narrated it as being a point of dispute among the Sahaabah, whereas in fact it was a matter on which there was consensus. 
Whoever ponders the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And come not near to unlawful sex. Verily, it is a Faahishah (i.e. anything that transgresses its limits: a great sin, and an evil way that leads one to hell unless Allah Forgives him)”
[al-Isra’ 17:32]
And the verse in which He says concerning homosexuality (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And (remember) Loot (Lot), when he said to his people: “Do you commit the worst sin such as none preceding you has committed in the ‘Aalameen (mankind and jinn)?”
[al-A’raaf 7:80]
will see a difference between the two. For Allah mentioned zina without the definite article, indicating it is a kind of evil action, but He mentioned homosexuality (liwaat) with the definite article al-, which means that it encompasses all aspects of faahishah or evil.   
Then Allah confirms that and states that no one in the ‘aalameen (mankind and jinn) ever did this before them, as He says, “such as none preceding you has committed in the ‘Aalameen (mankind and jinn)”. Then He emphasizes that even further by mentioning it a blunt manner that demonstrates the abhorrent nature of this action, which is a man having intercourse with a man as a man has intercourse with a woman, and He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, you practise your lusts on men instead of women”
[al-A’raaf 7:81]
Then Allah confirms how abhorrent that is by stating that the homosexuals distort the nature with which Allah has created men, which is to desire women rather than men. They have twisted the natural order and they approach men with desire rather than women. Hence Allah turned their houses upside down and their hearts likewise, and they were turned upside down, as a punishment. 
Then Allah reiterated the abhorrence of their actions by judging them to have transgressed all bounds as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Nay, but you are a people transgressing beyond bounds (by committing great sins)”
[al-A’raaf 7:81]
Think about this: was this, or anything similar, said concerning adultery? And Allah reiterated the abhorrent nature of their action when He said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and We saved him from the town (folk) who practised Al‑Khabaa’ith (evil, wicked and filthy deeds)”
[al-Anbiya’ 21:74]
Then Allah the All-Knowing condemned them further by describing them as being extremely evil, as He said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, they were a people given to evil, and were Faasiqoon (rebellious, disobedient to Allah)”
[al-Anbiya’ 21:74]
And He described them as mufsidoon (evildoers etc), as He said (interpretation of the meaning): 
 
“My Lord! Give me victory over the people who are Mufsidoon (those who commit great crimes and sins, oppressors, tyrants, mischief‑makers, corrupters).”
[al-‘Ankaboot 29:30]
And He called them zaalimoon (wrongdoers), in the words that the angels said to Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, we are going to destroy the people of this [Loot (Lot’s)] town (i.e. the town of Sodom in Palestine); truly, its people have been Zaalimoon [wrongdoers, polytheists disobedient to Allah, and belied their Messenger Loot (Lot)]”
[al-‘Ankaboot 29:31]
Think about those who have been punished in these ways, and whom Allah has condemned in such terms. 
And he said: 
Pleasure ceased and was followed with loss; desires ended and led to misery; they enjoyed themselves for a little while, but will be punished for a long time. They grazed on filth, and they suffer a painful torment. They were intoxicated with those desires, but they have awoken in the abode of the tormented. They feel the greatest regret, by Allah, at the time when regret is to no avail. They weep for what they did before, with tears of blood. If only you could see the highest and lowest of this group, with fire coming out from their faces and bodies when they are in the depths of Hell, drinking cups of boiling water instead of delightful drinks, being told as they are being dragged on their faces, “Taste of that which you used to earn.” 
“Taste you therein its heat and whether you are patient of it or impatient of it, it is all the same. You are only being requited for what you used to do”
[al-Toor 52:16 – interpretation of the meaning]
Adapted from al-Jawaab al-Kaafi, pp. 240-245. 
2 – The damaging effects it has on health: 
Dr Mahmoud al-Hijaazi said in his book al-Amraad al-Jinsiyyah wa’l-Tanaasuliyyah (Sexual and genital diseases), when discussing some of the dangers to health caused by committing sodomy: 
The diseases which are transmitted by way of sexual perversion (homosexuality) are: 
1.AIDS, which causes loss of acquired immunity and usually leads to death.
2.Viral inflammation of the liver
3.Syphilis
4.Gonorrhea
5.Herpes
6.Bacterial inflammation of the anus
7.Typhoid
8.Amoebiasis
9.Intestinal worms
10. Anal warts
11. Scabies
12. Pubic lice (“crabs”)
13. Cytomegalovirus that may lead to anal cancer
14. Genital-lymphatic pustules  
3 – The greatness of Allah’s mercy to those who repent 
From the above it is clear that this immoral action is seriously wrong and abhorrent, and leads to harmful consequences. Nevertheless the door is open for sinners to repent, and Allah rejoices at their repentance. 
Think about what Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And those who invoke not any other ilaah (god) along with Allah, nor kill such person as Allah has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse and whoever does this shall receive the punishment.
The torment will be doubled to him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace;
Except those who repent and believe (in Islamic Monotheism), and do righteous deeds; for those, Allah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allah is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful”
[al-Furqaan 25:68-70]
By thinking about the words, “Allah will change their sins into good deeds”, you will see how great is the bounty of Allah the Almighty. 
The scholars said that there are two meanings of the word “change”: 
(i)Bad attributes will be turned into good attributes, such as their shirk being turned into faith, their adultery into chastity, their lying into honesty, their treachery into trustworthiness, and so on.
(ii) The bad deeds that they have done will be turned into good deeds on the Day of Resurrection. 
So what you must do is repent to Allah and know that your coming back to Him is better for you and your family and your brothers and the entire society. 
Remember that life is short, and that the Hereafter is better and more lasting. Do not forget that Allah destroyed the people of Loot in a way that He did not destroy any other nation. 
4 – Ways of dealing with this problem 
(i)Keeping away from the things that make it easy for you to fall into this sin and remind you of it, such as:
-Letting your gaze wander and looking at women or movies
-Being alone with any man or woman 
(ii) Always keeping yourself busy with things that will benefit you in your religious or worldly affairs, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“So when you have finished (your occupation), devote yourself for Allah’s worship”
[al-Sharh 94:7]
So when you have finished with some worldly task, then strive to do something that will benefit you in the Hereafter, such as remembering Allah (dhikr), reading Qur’aan, seeking knowledge, listening to useful tapes, etc.
When you finish one act of worship then start another, and if you finish one worldly task then start another… and so on, because if you do not keep your nafs (self) busy with good things, it will keep you busy with bad things. So do not give your nafs any opportunity or spare time to think about this evil action. 
(iii) Compare the pleasure you feel when committing this sin with the regret, anxiety and confusion that follow it and stay with you for a long time, and then the torment that awaits the one who does that in the Hereafter. Do you think that any wise man would give precedence to this pleasure which vanishes after an hour over the regret and torment that follow? You can become more convinced of this if you read the book by Ibn al-Qayyim, al-Jawaab al-Kaafi li man sa’ala ‘an al-Dawa’ al-Shaafi. He wrote it for people in a situation like yours. May Allah make things easy for us and for you.  
(iv) The wise man does not give up a thing that he loves except for something that he loves more, or for fear of something he dislikes. This evil action will cause you to lose the blessings of this world and the Hereafter, to lose Allah’s love for you, and will incur the anger, wrath and punishment of Allah. 
Compare the good you will lose and the evil that will come to you because of this evil action. The wise man will see which should take precedence. 
(v) More important than all of the above is making du’aa’ and seeking the help of Allah to ward off this evil from you. Make the most of the times and situations in which prayers are answered, such as sujood (prostration), before the tasleem at the end of prayer, the last third of the night, when it is raining, when travelling, when fasting, and when breaking the fast. 
We ask Allah to guide you and to accept your repentance, and to help you to avoid bad deeds and bad attitudes. 
And Allah knows best.",Islam Q&A
27180,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/27180,Discussion with a Buddhist about jihad in Islam,"I am participating in an email argument about recent events in the war in Afghanistan, and the person who I am arguing with has made the following claim: 

""All Muslim clerics who are true to Islamic/Mohammad teaching preach that anyone other than Muslims are infidels and subject to the sword.""

 I don't believe this claim, but I am not a Muslim, and I know very little about Islam, so I don't have the facts to counter this person's claim. What is the Islamic truth here? How should I argue?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Your question to is indicative of a sincere desire to find 
    out the truth, but before that did you not ask yourself: why am I content 
    with this little that I know about Islam? Why don’t I get the full picture 
    about this religion from its followers, even if that means that I have to 
    travel to them? People often travel to earn money or for pleasure, or for 
    other material purposes, or even for foolish purposes. 

    It is the matter of one’s eternal destiny. Is it not possible 
    that this truth that you are seeking is to be found in that which you do not 
    know about Islam? 

    It is even more serious than that, for it is the matter of 
    eternal Paradise or eternal Hell. 

    But in addition to that sincere desire to discover the truth, 
    you also need an even more sincere desire to follow it and the will power to 
    adhere to it, even if it runs contrary to what you were accustomed to 
    before. 

    Moreover, by asking this question you seem to be like a sick 
    person who looks at the surgeon’s knife and its sharpness, and forgets the 
    disease that is killing him, or curses the cautery for its burning and 
    forgets the leprosy that is consuming him. This is not the way of the wise. 

    First of all you should understand the motives for jihad in 
    Islam, before asking about who deserves to be killed. 

    These motives were summed up by Rib’i ibn ‘Aamir and other 
    companions of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    and were stated to Rustam, the commander of the Persian army, in the battle 
    of al-Qaadisiyyah, when he asked them one after another, for three 
    consecutive days before the battle took place: “What is this that you have 
    brought?” The answer came: “Allaah has sent us to bring forth whomsoever He 
    wills from the worship of people to the worship of Allaah alone, from the 
    hardship of this world to its ease, from the injustice of other religions to 
    the justice of Islam. He sent His Messenger with His religion to His 
    creation. Whoever accepts it from us, we will accept it from him and will go 
    back; we will leave him and his land alone. Whoever refuses, we will fight 
    him until we end up in Paradise or in victory.” 

    This religion has always – and continues to and always will – 
    be faced with resistance based on deviant beliefs and false ideologies, with 
    political, military, social, economic and racial obstacles. All these 
    obstacles combined may produce an attitude that rejects Islam altogether and 
    prevents people from following it.  
If verbal discussions 
    and debates, arguing in a way that is better, address deviant beliefs and 
    ideas, then the jihad movement addresses other, material obstacles, foremost 
    among which is the political power that is based on those combined factors. 
    It aims its strikes at the military and political powers that enslave the 
    people to something other than Allaah – i.e., rules them by means of 
    something other than the laws of Allaah – and that prevent them from 
    listening to the truth and following it with absolute freedom. Thus there is 
    a need for both da’wah and jihad in order to face the real obstacles of 
    life. 

    See Ma’aalim fi’l-Tareeq, p. 59 ff 

    Thus it becomes clear that the basic principle of fighting as 
    prescribed in sharee’ah is jihad, and its purpose is that all religion 
    should be devoted to Allaah, and that the word of Allaah should be supreme. 
    Whoever tries to prevent that is to be fought, according to the consensus of 
    the Muslims. With regard to those who are not involved in resistance and 
    fighting – such as women, children, monks, old men, the blind, the 
    chronically ill, and so on – they are not to be killed, according to the 
    majority of scholars, unless they fight in word or deed… because we are to 
    fight those who fight us, if we want the religion of Allaah to prevail, as 
    Allaah says (Interpretation of the meaning): 
“And fight in the way of 
    Allaah those who fight you, but transgress not the limits. Truly, Allaah 
    likes not the transgressors”

    [al-Baqarah 2:190]

     It was proven that our Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) passed by a woman who had been killed in one of his 
    battles, and the people were standing around her, and he said: “This one was 
    not a fighter.” And he sent a man to Khaalid ibn al-Waleed – who was a 
    general at the head of his army – and commanded him: “Tell him not to kill 
    any children or hired workers.” Perhaps what is meant is those who were not 
    bearing arms. Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2669; al-Albaani said: It is hasan 
    saheeh; Saheeh Abi Dawood, 2324. 
Allaah has permitted 
    killing to whatever extent it is needed to bring people to the right path, 
    as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “and Al‑Fitnah (tumult and oppression) is worse than 
    killing”

    [al-Baqarah 2:217] 
i.e., although killing 
    involves evil and mischief, the evil and mischief caused by the fitnah of 
    the disbelievers (the tumult and oppression that they cause) is worse than 
    that. With regard to the person who does not try to prevent the Muslims from 
    establishing the religion of Allaah, his disbelief harms no one but 
    himself. 

    Al-Siyaasah al-Shar’iyyah by Ibn 
    Taymiyah, 165-167. 

    Here there is an important point to be made: fighting, 
    aggression and oppression are old problems that affect mankind so long as 
    people are influenced by greed and by whims and desires, and so long as both 
    good and evil exist among men. Ibn Khaldoon said:  

    “Wars and all kinds of fighting have existed from the moment 
    Allaah created mankind. Their origin is the desire that some people have to 
    wreak vengeance on others… This is something natural in man and no nation or 
    era is free of this...” 

    Moreover, what do the Muslims have to do with the terrible 
    wars that have taken place between various Christian groups in the past, and 
    what befell the Protestants at the hands of the Catholics? 

    What do the Muslims have to do with the two World Wars, or 
    with Hiroshima and Nagasaki? 

    We have the right to say, along with Count Henri de Christie: 
    “It is more correct to say that the peaceful nature and gentleness of the 
    Muslims is the reason why their state fell.” 

    Allaah the Almighty has spoke the truth: 
“Those who have been 
    expelled from their homes unjustly only because they said: ‘Our Lord is 
    Allaah.’ For had it not been that Allaah checks one set of people by means 
    of another, monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques, wherein the Name 
    of Allaah is mentioned much would surely, have been pulled down. Verily, 
    Allaah will help those who help His (Cause). Truly, Allaah is All‑Strong, 
    All‑Mighty”

    [al-Hajj 22:40]

    Think about that, then listen to the words of the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Allaah wonders at those 
    who will enter Paradise in chains.” (Saheeh al-Bukhaari, 3030). And 
    he said: “[The verse] ‘You are the best of peoples ever raised up for 
    mankind’ [Aal ‘Imraan 3:110] means, You are the best for the people, as 
    you bring them with chains on theirnecks till 
    they embrace Islam” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4557) – i.e., when they fight 
    others, they may take some of them prisoner, or others may submit to their 
    rule, then they come to know Islam and enter into the faith, even though 
    they disliked it at first. 

    Perhaps if you do that, you will kiss the hand of the doctor, 
    even if the scars of his scalpel are left on your skin.

27190,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/27190,What is the ruling on one who discloses secrets?,What is mentioned in Quaran and Hadeeth about revealing a secret to someone that was told in confidence?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Secrets are a kind of trust, and thus they are a kind of contract or covenant which must be kept. It is necessary to be harsh with those who disclose them, because they are betraying a trust and breaking their promise; and those who deserve to have a ta’zeer punishment should be punished.  
Secrets vary. There are those for which the person who discloses them must be dealt with harshly, because disclosing them causes widespread harm, such as disclosing secrets to the kuffaar and enabling them to defeat the Muslims or gain victory over them. This is what is known in modern parlance as high treason. And there are secrets that are less serious, such as those in which disclosure causes harm to individuals. But in all cases disclosure is a betrayal of the trust and breaking of the covenant. 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And fulfil (every) covenant. Verily, the covenant will be questioned about” [al-Isra’ 17:34]
“Verily, Allah commands that you should render back the trusts to those, to whom they are due” [al-Nisa’ 4:58]
So if keeping secrets is obligatory, then disclosing them is haram. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told a secret to ‘Aa’ishah and Hafsah and entrusted them with it, but they disclosed the secret, and Allah rebuked them for that. 
Allah said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And (remember) when the Prophet  disclosed a matter in confidence to one of his wives (Hafsah), then she told it (to another i.e. ‘Aa’ishah). And Allah made it known to him; he informed part thereof and left a part. Then when he told her (Hafsah) thereof, she said: ‘Who told you this?’ He said: ‘The All-Knower, the All-Aware (Allah) has told me.’” [al-Tahreem 66:3]
Then Allah said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“If you two (wives of the Prophet: ‘Aa’ishah and Hafsah) turn in repentance to Allah, (it will be better for you), your hearts are indeed so inclined (to oppose what the Prophet likes); but if you help one another against him (Muhammad), then verily, Allah is his Mawlaa (Lord, or Master, or Protector), and Jibreel (Gabriel), and the righteous among the believers; and furthermore, the angels are his helpers” [al-Tahreem 66:4]
Then the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) withdrew from his wives for a month because of the secret that Hafsah had disclosed to ‘Aa’ishah. Al-Bukhaari, 5191. Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said concerning this hadeeth: This indicates that the one who discloses a secret may be punished in a fitting manner. 
In the Sunnah we find a warning against seeking out the secrets of others, and spreading secrets that should not be spread. 
For example, it is strongly discouraged to seek out the faults of others. According to a hadeeth narrated from Abu Hurayrah, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If a man were to look into your private affairs without your permission, and you were to throw a pebble at him and put out his eye, there would be no sin on you.” Al-Bukhaari, 6902; Muslim, 2158. Ibn Hajar said, commenting on this hadeeth: It is narrated by Muslim with a different isnaad from Abu Hurayrah: “Whoever looks into some people’s house without their permission, it is permissible for them to put out his eye.” And it was narrated with yet another isnaad from Abu Hurayrah in a version that states it even more clearly; this is narrated by Ahmad, Ibn Abi ‘Aasim and al-Nasaa’i, and classed as saheeh by Ibn Hibbaan and al-Bayhaqi. This version says: “Whoever looks into some people’s house without their permission, and they put his eye out, there is no diyah (blood money) and no qisaas (retaliatory punishment).” And according to one report through this isnaad, “… and it is worthless.” 
Similarly there is the warning against the one who eavesdrops on the secrets of others. It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever eavesdrops on the conversation of other people when they do not want him (to listen), or they move away from him, molten lead will be poured into his ears on the Day of Resurrection.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 7042. 
The warning against spreading things that it is not permissible to spread includes condemnation of the one who spread marital secrets. He is regarded as being among the most evil of people before Allah. 
It was narrated that Abu Sa’eed (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Among the most evil of people before Allah on the Day of Resurrection will be a man who is intimate with a woman and she with him, then he spreads her secret.” Narrated by Muslim, 1437. 
According to another report narrated by Muslim, 1437, “One of the greatest trusts before Allah on the Day of Resurrection will be a man who was intimate with his wife and she with him, then he spread her secret.” What is meant by “one of the greatest trusts” is one of the greatest betrayals of trust. 
Among the advice given by the Arabs to new brides is: “Do not disclose his secret, for if you disclose his secret, you will make him hate you.”  
The secrets of the home should not be disclosed, and wise men and those who are religiously committed advise the one who knows a secret not to disclose it.  
It was narrated from Thaabit that Anas said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came to me when I was playing with some other boys, and greeted us with salaam, then he sent me on an errand. I was late going home to my mother, and when I came she asked, ‘What kept you?’ I said, ‘The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sent me on an errand.’ She said, ‘What did he need?’ I said, ‘It is a secret.’ She said, ‘Never disclose the secret of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to anyone.’ Anas said: ‘By Allah if I were to disclose it to anyone I would have disclosed it to you, O Thaabit.’
Narrated by Muslim, 2482. 
Disclosing secrets is one of the signs of hypocrisy, because it comes under the heading of betraying a trust. 
It was narrated from ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There are four qualities, whoever has all of them is a pure hypocrite, and whoever has some of them has a characteristic of hypocrisy until he gives it up: when he is entrusted with something he betrays that trust; when he speaks he lies; when he makes a promise he breaks it, and when he disputes he resorts to lies and falsehood.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 34; Muslim, 58. 
It is not a condition of a trust that the one who speaks these words must tell his listener that it is a secret that he should not tell anyone, rather it is sufficient for his manner to indicate that, such as if he takes him away from others to tell him, or when he tells him he looks around to see if anyone is listening, etc. 
Al-Tirmidhi (1959) narrated from Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If a man tells you something then looks around, it is a trust.” Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
And it says in Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi: 
“Then looks around” means looking to the right and the left out of caution. “It is a trust” means it is entrusted to the one to whom he spoke, i.e., it comes under the same rulings as a trust, so he must conceal it. Ibn Raslaan said: Because his looking around is the signal to the one to whom he is speaking that he is afraid that someone may overhear him, and that he has chosen him to tell his secret to. His looking around takes the place of his saying, ‘Listen to this and keep quiet about it because it is a trust (or a secret).’”

    You should note that it has been proven that the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “How wonderful is the 
    affair of the believer, for it is all good, and this does not apply to 
    anyone except the believer. If something good happens to him, he gives 
    thanks for it and that is good for him, and if something bad happens to him 
    he bears it with patience and that is good for him.” Narrated by Muslim, 
    2999. This hadeeth indicates that all the believer’s affairs are good, 
    because he alternates between gratitude and patience, and there is reward in 
    both.  

    You should also note that the best of people, the Messengers 
    (peace be upon them) were slandered by their enemies. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Likewise, no Messenger 
    came to those before them but they said: ‘A sorcerer or a madman!’”

    [al-Dhaariyaat 51:52]

    Even our Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) was slandered by his enemies and accused of being a sorcerer or a 
    madman. 

    Indeed, things got so bad that the hypocrites impugned his 
    honour, but despite that he bore it all with patience and sought reward from 
    Allaah, and he put his trust in Allaah. 

    “And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He 
    will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty).

    3. And He will provide him from (sources) he never could 
    imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allaah, then He will suffice him. 
    Verily, Allaah will accomplish his purpose”

    [al-Talaaq 65:2-3]

    So you have to be patient and seek reward with Allaah, and 
    remember that this is one of the means by which Allaah expiates your sins. 

    You have the right to defend yourself and establish your 
    innocence of whatever you are accused of, and to denounce as liars those who 
    accuse you of that; this is not regarded as the kind of gheebah (backbiting 
    or gossip) that is forbidden. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Allaah does not like that the evil should be uttered in 
    public except by him who has been wronged”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:148]
If you can confront the 
    one who has accused you and advise him and exhort him to fear Allaah, that 
    is good. Perhaps he will give up what he has been doing and that will be a 
    cause of his repenting and following the straight path. Or you could send a 
    wise person to do that.

     You have to avoid situations and places that may cause doubts and suspicion, because that person may take them as a means to confirm his suspicions. You have to be patient and turn to Allaah, calling upon Him, and Allaah will grant you relief from what you are facing.  And Allaah knows best.",Islam Q&A

    Allaah be upon him) said: “Tiyarah (belief in evil omens) is shirk.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
Ahmad (7045) and 
    al-Tabaraani narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Amr said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever lets 
    tiyarah stop him from doing something is guilty of shirk.” They said, “What is the kafaarah for that?” He said, “To say: Allaahumma la khayra 
    illaa khayruka wa laa tayra illaa tayruka wa laa ilaaha ghayruka (O Allaah, there is no good except Your good, no birds (omens) except from 
    You, and there is no god beside You).” [Classed as hasan by al-Arna’oot and as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, no. 6264]
Al-Tabaraani narrated in
    al-Kabeer from ‘Imraan ibn Husayn that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “He is not one of us who 
    practices augury [seeking omens in birds] or has that done for him, or who practices divination or has that done for him, or who practices 
    witchcraft or has that done for him.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, no. 5435. 
Al-Nawawi (may Allaah 
    have mercy on him) said in Sharh Muslim, no. 2224:  
Tatayyur (belief in bad omens) is pessimism, and is based 
    on something disliked, be it a word or action or something seen… They used to startle birds to make them move; if they went to the right they 
    would regard that as a good omen and go ahead with their journeys or other plans, but if they went to the left they would cancel their journeys 
    and plans, and regard that as a bad omen. So it would often prevent them from doing things that were in their interests. Islam cancelled out all 
    that and forbade it, and said that it had no effect, whether good or bad. This is what is meant by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him): “There is no tiyarah (superstitious belief in bird omens),” and in another hadeeth, “Tiyarah is shirk” – i.e., the belief 
    that it can bring benefit or harm, if they act upon it believing that it has any effect, then this is shirk, because they think that it has an 
    effect on what one does or that it can make things happen. 
This is the basic principle regarding bad omens (tatayyur). 
    But there are ahaadeeth which indicate that a bad omen may be in a woman, a house or a horse. 
Al-Bukhaari (5093) and Muslim (2252) narrated from 
    ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with them both) that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “Bad omens are in a woman, a house and a horse.”
Al-Bukhaari (5094) and Muslim, (2252) narrated that Ibn 
    ‘Umar said: Mention of bad omens was made in the presence of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If bad omens are to be found in anything, it is in a house, a woman and a horse.”
Abu Dawood (3924) narrated that Anas ibn Maalik said: A man 
    said: “O Messenger of Allaah, we were in a house and our numbers and wealth were great, then we moved to another house where our numbers and 
    wealth decreased.” The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Leave it, it is bad.” This hadeeth was classed 
    as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
The scholars differed concerning these ahaadeeth and how to 
    reconcile them with the ahaadeeth that forbid tatayyur. Some of them interpreted them as they appear to be, and said that this is an exception 
    from the ruling on tatayyur, i.e., that tatayyur is forbidden unless a person has a house which he does not want to live in, or a wife whom he 
    does not want to keep company with, or a horse or servant, all of which he should get rid of by selling them, or by divorcing the wife.
Others said that a house may be regarded as a bad omen when 
    it is too small, or there are bad neighbours who cause trouble; a woman may be regarded as a bad omen when she does not produce children, or she 
    has a sharp tongue, or she behaves in a suspicious manner; a horse may be regarded as a bad omen when it is not used in jihad, or it was said, 
    when it is difficult to handle or it is too expensive; and a servant may be regarded as a bad omen when he has a bad attitude or is not 
    trustworthy or reliable.
Sharh al-Nawawi ‘ala Muslim.
The correct view is that all types of belief in bad omens 
    are condemned, and that no kinds of women, houses or animals can cause harm or bring benefit except by Allaah’s leave. Allaah is the Creator of 
    both good and evil. A person may be tested with a wife who has a bad attitude, or a house in which there is a lot of problems, in which case it is 
    prescribed for him to rid himself of these things, fleeing from the decree of Allaah to the decree of Allaah, and so as to avoid falling into 
    pessimism and belief in bad omens which is forbidden.
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:
“Another group said: 
    regarding these three as bad omens only affects those who believe in that. Whoever puts his trust in Allaah and does not believe in omens and 
    superstition, that does not affect him. They said: this is indicated by the hadeeth of Anas, ‘A bad omen only affects the one who believes in it.’ 
    If a person believes in bad omens, Allaah may make that the cause of bad things happening to him, just as He may make trust in Him and making Him 
    alone the focus of one's fear and hope one of the main causes of warding off evil that people may superstitiously expect. 
The reason for that is 
    that tiyarah (superstitious belief in omens) implies shirk or associating others with Allaah, fearing others besides Him and not putting one’s 
    trust in Him. The superstitious person attracts evil to himself, so the superstition affects him more, because he did not protect himself with 
    belief in Allaah alone and trust in Allaah. If a person fears something other than Allaah, it gains control over him and he is tormented by it; if 
    he loves something else as well as Allaah, he will be tormented by it; if he puts his hope in something alongside Allaah he will be let down by 
    it. These matters are well known from real life and there is no need to provide further evidence. Everyone inevitably feels superstitious but the 
    strong believer wards off those superstitious feelings by putting his trust in Allaah. Whoever puts his trust in Allaah, He will suffice him and 
    he will have no need of anyone or anything else. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“So when you want to 
    recite the Qur’aan, seek refuge with Allaah from Shaytaan (Satan), the outcast (the cursed one).
Verily, he has no 
    power over those who believe and put their trust only in their Lord (Allaah).
His power is only over those who obey and follow him (Satan), and those who join partners 
    with Him (Allaah, i.e. those who are Mushrikoon, i.e., polytheists)”
[al-Nahl 16:98]
Hence Ibn Mas’ood said: 
    “All of us sometimes feel superstitious, but Allaah causes it to disappear when we put our trust in Him.” They said: superstition with regard to 
    houses, women and horses may affect only those who believe in it; as for the one who puts his trust in Allaah and fears Him alone, and does not 
    believe in bad omens, then horses, women and houses cannot be bad omens for him.
Then he said:
Whoever believes that 
    the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) attributed a superstitious effect to anything in the sense that it may 
    have an effect in and of itself independently of Allaah is telling a serious lie against Allaah and His Messenger and has gone far astray. His 
    speaking of bad omens existing in these three things does not constitute proof of what he had denied before. All it means is that Allaah may a 
    superstitious effect in objects for those who come near them or live in them, and there may be some blessing in some objects, and anyone who comes 
    nears them is not affected by bad omens or anything bad. This is like when Allaah gives parents a blessed child and they experience goodness 
    because of him, whilst He gives others a mean child and they experience bad things because of him. This applies to what may Allaah may bestow on 
    His slave of houses, wives and horses. Allaah is the Creator of good and evil, good luck and bad luck. So some of these things may be “lucky” and 
    blessed and bring happiness for those who come into contact with them, so they are blessed; and some of them may be “unlucky” and bring “bad luck” 
    to those who come into contact with them, all by the will and decree of Allaah, just as He has created all other causes and effects which may 
    vary. So He has created musk and other fragrant substances, which give delight to all those who come into contact with them, and He has created 
    their opposites which cause disgust to all those who come into contact with them. The difference between the two types is known from experience. 
    The same applies to houses, women and horses. This is one thing, and the shirki belief in bad omens is something else altogether.
He said concerning the 
    Prophet’s command to that family to leave that house, as mentioned in the hadeeth quoted above:
This is not the kind of 
    superstition that is forbidden. Rather he told them to leave it when they started to think along these lines, in order to achieve two aims and two 
    benefits:
1 – It was so that they 
    would leave a place that they disliked and felt scared in because of what had happened to them there, so that they might find relief from the 
    panic, grief and depression that assailed them there, because Allaah has made it man’s nature to hate that which causes him harm even though it is 
    not the fault of that thing, and to love that which brings him happiness, even though the thing itself does not intend to do good. So he commanded 
    them to leave that which they disliked, because Allaah sent him as a mercy, and did not send him as a torment. He sent him to make things easy, 
    not to make things hard. So how could he have told them to stay in a place where they were unhappy and felt scared to stay because of the great 
    losses they had suffered there, when that would serve no purpose of worship or increase their piety or guidance, especially when they had stayed 
    there for so long after they had begun to feel uncomfortable there which made them superstitious. So this protected them from two serious things:
1 – Committing shirk
2 – Protecting them from 
    something bad happening to them because of their superstition, which usually affects those who believe in it. So he protected them because of his 
    great mercy and kindness from these two disliked things, by telling them to leave that house and move to another without any harm coming to them 
    with regard to either their worldly or religious interests.

My father threw me out of the house so I moved to a Muslim country with my husband to live there. I still keep in touch with my mother. Is there any sin on me for not keeping in touch with my father, knowing that he tells people I am a prostitute and he is threatening to kill me and my family?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.We praise Allaah for having guided you to Islam. Undoubtedly Allaah has blessed you greatly by choosing you from among your family to be the first of them to enter this religion. We ask 
    Allaah to make you the cause of them also entering Islam. 
What you have done of calling your family to 
    Islam is what Allaah has enjoined upon you; they take priority over others when it comes to da’wah and telling them the truth. 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say (O Muhammad): ‘This is my way; I invite unto Allaah (i.e. to the Oneness of Allaah — 
    Islamic Monotheism) with sure knowledge, I and whosoever follows me (also must invite others to Allaah, i.e. to the Oneness of Allaah — Islamic 
    Monotheism with sure knowledge). And Glorified and Exalted be Allaah (above all that they associate as partners with Him). And I am not of the 
    Mushrikoon (polytheists, pagans, idolaters and disbelievers in the Oneness of Allaah; those who worship others along with Allaah or set up rivals 
    or partners to Allaah)’”
[Yoosuf 12:108]
“And warn your tribe (O Muhammad) of near 
    kindred”
[al-Shu’ara’ 26:214]
The person who calls others to Allaah should 
    be gentle and subtle in his approach, especially with his family. Allaah has commanded us to treat our parents kindly, even if they are kaafirs 
    and call us to kufr. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Invite (mankind, O Muhammad) to the way of your Lord (i.e. Islam) with wisdom (i.e. with the 
    Divine Revelation and the Qur’aan) and fair preaching, and argue with them in a way that is better. Truly, your Lord knows best who has gone 
    astray from His path, and He is the Best Aware of those who are guided”
[al-Nahl 16:125] 
“And We have enjoined on man to be good 
    and dutiful to his parents; but if they strive to make you join with Me (in worship) anything (as a partner) of which you have no knowledge, then 
    obey them not. Unto Me is your return and I shall tell you what you used to do”
[al-‘Ankaboot 29:8]
If any of them does not respond, his 
    misguidance is his own problem and Allaah will not make the daa’iyah accountable for any of his sin. 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Whoever goes right, then he goes right 
    only for the benefit of his ownself. And whoever goes astray, then he goes astray to his own loss. No one laden with burdens can bear another’s 
    burden. And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger (to give warning)”
[al-Isra’ 17:15]
What you did, migrating to one of the Muslim 
    countries and getting married, was the right thing to do. The Muslim cannot usually maintain his or her religious commitment in a hostile 
    environment where he or she is a stranger; it is especially hard for a woman who has no power and no strength except with Allaah. This difficulty 
    is demonstrated by what your father did, throwing you out of the house when he found out that you are a Muslim, 
Your keeping in touch with your mother and 
    asking after your father is something for which you deserve praise; this is something that Allaah has enjoined upon you. The rights of parents are 
    great, so do not cut off your ties with them, even if they mistreat you. Try to get in touch with your father and speak kindly to him; perhaps 
    that will be a cause of his being guided and will dispel the hardness in his heart towards you. 
With regard to your father’s threats, do not 
    pay any attention to them and do not worry about them; nothing will happen to you or your husband or your family except that which Allaah has 
    decreed for you. So take precautions and seek refuge with Allaah, for He is the Best of protectors and He is the Most Merciful of those who show 
    mercy. 
With regard to his slander and accusations 
    against you, this comes under the heading of the kaafir’s persecution of the Muslim. The honour of our Prophet Muhammad  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) was slandered when his wife and our mother, the Mother of the Believers ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) was 
    accused of adultery; and it was said that he was a sorcerer, a soothsayer and a madman. Similar accusations were made against his brother Prophets 
    as well. Be patient and trust that Allaah will give you a way out and will relieve you of your worry; seek His help and always make du’aa’ to Him 
    and turn to Him, for He is the Best of supporters and helpers. 
We ask Allaah to make you steadfast in adhering to His religion and to increase you in guidance, insight and knowledge.",Islam Q&A
