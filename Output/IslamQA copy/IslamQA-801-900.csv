I am desiring to embrace Islam, however I have a slight concern. I am legally 
blind and use a guide dog for mobility purposes. I have been informed that I 
have no problems being a Muslim and having a guide dog due to my 
disability. However, I am concerned at the reaction that I get from other 
Muslims when I approach an Islamic Center. I do not want to offend but 
without the assistance of the guide dog I am unable to travel to a Masjid or 
Islamic center alone. With who should I discuss this situation i.e., an Imam? I 
sometimes feel I am at a ""stalemate"" . 
Thank you for your help.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Al-hamdu lillaah. (All praise be to God Almighty, Allaah.)
To the dear noble inquirer:
You have reached the doorstep of entering into Islam and are hesitant due to concern 
over what you may face vis-à-vis the response of fellow Muslims regarding the dog you 
use to guide you to the masjid or Islamic center. Let me assure you that the matter is 
simple and much easier to deal with than you may think.
You are a man for whom Allaah has ordained blindness as a trial, and there is little or 
no practical recourse for your daily movement, coming and going, other than a trained 
guide dog. Whereas keeping a dog without due need is censured and objectionable 
according to Islamic shari’ah (due to its filth and uncleanness), in your case keeping a 
dog is clearly for an urgent need and not out of custom, tradition, or love for owning 
the dog itself. So perhaps you have a valid excuse regarding this issue, Allaah willing.
I can’t imagine that you would require to enter the mosque or Islamic center with the 
dog; rather, you most likely would leave him outside and enter for worship, attending a 
religious gathering, or to learn and ask about matters concerning your religion. As long 
as the case is as such, the issue is solved and the matter is settled. If you leave the dog at 
a distance from the entrance to the mosque, then whoever among the Muslim does not 
welcome you warmly would clearly be committing a mistake. You could also contact 
the director of the Islamic center or whoever fills such a position, in order to explain to 
him your situation. I would expect him to assume the responsibility for informing those 
who administer as well as attend the mosque. If you like, feel free to take this response 
as a letter to him and ask him to peruse it, and I am confident you will find only 
goodwill and cordiality, Allaah willing.
In closing I would like to welcome you to the religion of Islam and send you a warm 
salutation and an extraordinary congratulations on your desire to accept the religion. I 
urge you to hasten in taking the greatest step of your life since your mother gave birth to 
you, and would like to leave you with glad tidings regarding the disability with which 
you are afflicted. In fact, you will receive a great reward for your blindness if you 
accept Islam, as per the saying of our Prophet Muhammad  (peace be upon him) 
[translation of the meaning]:
""Verily Allaah has said, ‘If I afflict one of My worshippers with a trial regarding his 
two dearest ones (i.e., his eyes) and he is patient and perseveres, I will compensate him 
for them Heaven.’ "" (Hadeeth al-Bukhari, Fath ul-Baari #5653)
We ask Allaah to open your heart to the truth and to assist you in holding fast to it, and 
Allaah is the One Who Guides to the true path of righteousness.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
804,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/804,Uncertain of the number of breast-feedings,"My question is about marriage. I want to marry a cousin because we are very deeply in love. But we heard that I got some milk from her mother. Then we wondered how many times this had happened. When we asked her mother, she said, ""I don’t remember - it is so long ago."" So she does not remember how many times she may have given me milk. I do not know what I should do in such a situation.
But one thing I know very well is that I love her very much! Please advise me.",,,"Praise be to Allah.For breast-feeding to have the effect of making a child a relative (mahram), two conditions must be met:
(1) The number of breast-feedings should be five or more, because of the hadith of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), who said: ""When the Qur’an was first revealed, the number of breast-feedings that would make a child a relative (mahram) was ten, then this was abrogated and replaced with the number of five which is well-known."" (Reported by Muslim, no. 1452).
(2) This should happen within the first two years of the child’s life, because of the hadith: ""Harmalah ibn Yahya told us that ‘Abdullah ibn Wahb told us that Ibn Lahimah informed us from Abu al-Aswad from ‘Urwah from ‘Abdullah ibn al-Zubayr that the Messenger of Allah (Peace & Blessings of Allah be Upon Him) said: ""There is no breast-feeding except what fills the stomach to bursting point."" (Reported by Ibn Maajah, no. 1946; see also Saheeh al-Jaami‘, no. 7495). Al-Bukhaari, may Allah have mercy on him, included a chapter in his Saheeh entitled: ""The chapter of the one who says there is no breast-feeding after two years because of the words of Allah ‘. . . two whole years, (that is) for those (parents) who desire to complete the term of suckling . . .’ [al-Baqarah 2:233].""
The definition of rad‘ah (one breast-feed) is that the child should take the breast and drink milk from it, then leave it of his own accord in order to breathe or to change position, and so on.
If this is the case, then the rulings concerning breast-feeding will apply, i.e. the child will be considered a relative and marriage will be forbidden, etc.
In the case of doubt concerning the number of breast-feedings, Ibn Qudaamah, may Allah have mercy on him, said: ""If there is some doubt concerning whether breast-feeding took place, or concerning the number of feeds and whether it was enough to make the child a relative (mahram) or not, then there is no proof that the child must be considered a relative, because the general rule of life is that a child does not breast-feed from anyone except his own mother, and one cannot dismiss certainty in favour of doubt. (al-Mughni 11/312).
Therefore it is permissible to marry if there is no proof of breast-feeding that would make the individual concerned a relative.
I do not want to omit reminding the one who asked this question that we are obliged to adhere to the Sharee‘ah no matter where it leads us, and our desires and emotions should not prevent us from following the truth. The Muslim must remain chaste and avoid all kinds of ""love relationships."" He must strive to protect himself by marrying in a proper fashion according to Islamic sharee‘ah.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
811,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/811,Why death is the punishment for Apostasy,"Alslamualik
This question has bees asked several time from non-Muslims and I want 
to find an answer: Why When the Muslim convert to another 
religion(Murtad) he/she should be killed?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
Your question may be answered by the following points:
(1) This is the ruling of Allaah and His Messenger, as the Prophet 
 (peace and 
blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""Whoever changes his religion, kill him."" 
(reported by al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, no. 3017).
(2) The one who has known the religion which Allaah revealed, entered it and 
practised it, then rejected it, despised it and left it, is a person who does not deserve 
to live on the earth of Allaah and eat from the provision of Allaah.
(3) By leaving Islaam, the apostate opens the way for everyone who wants to leave the 
faith, thus spreading apostasy and encouraging it.
(4) The apostate is not to be killed without warning. Even though his crime is so great, 
he is given a last chance, a respite of three days in which to repent. If he repents, he 
will be left alone; if he does not repent, then he will be killed.
(5) If the punishment for murder and espionage (also known as high treason) is death, 
then what should be the punishment for the one who disbelieves in the Lord of 
mankind and despises and rejects His religion? Is espionage or shedding blood worse 
than leaving the religion of the Lord of mankind and rejecting it?
(6) None of those who bleat about personal freedom and freedom of belief would put 
up with a neighbour’s child hitting their child or justify this as ""personal freedom,"" so 
how can they justify leaving the true religion and rejecting the sharee’ah which Allaah 
revealed to teach mankind about His unity and bring justice and fairness to all?

824,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/824,What should a person who borrowed with interest(Ribba) do?,"Salam Brother, 
My question is; how does one purify himself or his place of business from things 
that may have occurred prior to knowledge that it was haram? For example, I own 
clothing stores, but have financed this business via moneys borrowed and paid 
interest upon. To this day I am using a bank where I have a loan and pay interest 
on it. 
Also in the past I had a business that did not succeed, and was forced into 
bankruptcy, which meant that there were many people and businesses that were 
left unpaid, what is my Islamic duty in that case? I did make a sincere effort to pay 
all that I could but after the business went bad was not able to repay them.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is wajib that you repent for each loan involving interest you took. The Prophet (peace and 
blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed all involved in the interest, the recipient, the sponsor, 
and the one eating and the feeding it, as stated in the authentic hadith. The Prophet (peace 
and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ""The gold for the gold, the silver for the silver, 
wheat for wheat, barley for barley, date for date, salt for salt, similar for the like, and hand 
in hand. So whoever adds or seeks to add, then he has used riba. The recipient and the giver 
of the transaction are the same"". (Reported by Muslim, #1584.)
On the authority of Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) who said that the Messenger of Allah 
(peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ""cursed the one who consumes interest, the one 
giving it, the one bearing scroll, and the two witnesses to it"". He said (peace and blessings 
of Allah be upon him), ""they are all equal."" (Muslim narrated it.) 
If a Muslim wants to partake in a specific affair and he doesn't know it's ruling, then it is upon 
him to ask before he gets involved in it. Ignorance isn't an excuse for each and every situation. 
As far as the loans you borrowed, you are obligated to return the initial money borrowed only. 
If you are forced to pay riba, and that is the added amount with no way out, then we hope that 
you do your best in repenting to Allah to pardon you. We also hope that you remain consistent 
in your business and give sadaqa with what you are able to, in order to purify yourself and your 
wealth.

Drinking coffee is a custom and not from the laws of Islam. If drinking coffee in excess becomes 
dangerous to the individual, then Islam prohibits it. There are no ceremonies in Islam for coffee 
drinking nor is drinking coffee from the particular customs of the Muslims, since Muslims as well 
as non-Muslims drink coffee. There are however specific manners in the Islamic law concerning 
drinking in general.
From amongst them are the following: 
Drinking with the right hand.
To say Bismillah before you begin to drink.
Drinking at least three sips or more and not drinking the entire drink at once.
To praise Allah after finishing the drink. 
To drink sitting down.
The person giving the drink to others should drink last.
The person passing out the drinks should start on his right hand side when distributing the 
drinks.
An individual should not drink from the pitcher, but instead pour some of the drink into a 
dish or cup, and then drink.
A person should not drink from gold or silver dishes.

witnesses from amongst you against them; and if they testify, confine them to houses until 
death do claim them, or Allah ordain for them some (other) way."" [al-Nisa’ 4:15]
Ibn Katheer, may Allah have mercy on him, said in his Tafseer (explanation) of this aayah:
""At the beginning of Islam, the ruling concerning a woman who was proven guilty of adultery 
was that she was to be detained in a house and not allowed to come out until she died. So the 
phrase ‘If any of your women are guilty of lewdness’ refers to adultery. ‘Take the evidence of 
four (reliable) witnesses from amongst you against them; and if they testify, confine them to 
houses until death do claim them, or Allah ordain for them some (other) way’ - the ‘other way’ 
that Allah made for them was the abrogation of this. Ibn ‘Abbas, may Allah be pleased with 
him, said: ‘This was the ruling until Allah revealed Surat al-Nur, then this punishment was 
abrogated and replaced with whipping or stoning.’ Something similar was reported from 
‘Ikrimah, Sa‘id ibn Jubayr, al-Hasan, ‘Ataa’ al-Khurasani, Abu Saalih, Qutaadah, Zayd ibn 
Aslam and al-Dahhak, stating that this is abrogated, and this is agreed upon. Imam Ahmad said: 
‘Muhammad ibn Ja‘far told us that Sa‘id told us from Qutaadah from al-Hasan from Hattaan 
ibn ‘Abdullah al-Raqaashi from ‘Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit who said: Whenever the wahy 
(revelation) descended upon the Messenger of Allah 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him), it affected him, the stress showed on 
him and his face would change. Allah sent a revelation to him one day, and when it was over, he 
said: "" Listen to me, Allah has made another way for them. (When) a married man (commits 
adultery) with a married woman, and an unmarried man with an unmarried woman, then in the 
case of married (persons) there is (a punishment) of one hundred lashes and then stoning (to 
death), and in the case of unmarried persons, (the punishment) is one hundred lashes and exile 
for one year.""’ It was reported by Muslim and other narrators of Sunan via Qutaadah from 
al-Hasan from al-Hattan from ‘Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit from the Prophet 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) with the wording: 
‘Receive (teaching) from me, receive (teaching) from me. Allah has made another way for those 
(women). When an unmarried man commits adultery with an unmarried woman, (they should 
receive) one hundred lashes, and banishment for one year. In the case of a married male 
committing adultery with a married female, they should receive one hundred lashes and be 
stoned to death.’ Al-Tirmidhi said: This is a saheeh hasan hadeeth."" 
Al-Qurtubi, may Allah have mercy on him, said in his tafseer of this aayah:
""This [confinement] was the first punishment for adultery, at the beginning of Islam. Ibn 
‘Abbas and al-Hasan said: Ibn Zayd added: They would not be allowed to marry, until they 
died, as a punishment for them when they asked to marry someone else. This ruling applied for 
a while, then the Prophet 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said, according to the hadeeth narrated by ‘Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit: 
""Receive (teaching) from me, receive (teaching) from me. Allah has made another way for those 
(women). When an unmarried man commits adultery with an unmarried woman, (they should 
receive) one hundred lashes, and banishment for one year. In the case of a married male 
committing adultery with a married female, they should receive one hundred lashes and be 
stoned to death."" Some of the scholars said: the idea of punishment and shame was still there 
with the lashing, because there is no contradiction, and they are applied to one person. As for 
confinement, this is abrogated, by the consensus of the scholars. And Allah knows best. 
To complete the benefit of what has been said, it is appropriate to learn the tafseer of the next 
aayah in Surat al-Nisaa’:
""If two men among you are guilty of lewdness, punish them both. If they repent and amend, 
leave them alone; for Allah is Oft Returning, Most Merciful."" [al-Nisaa’ 4:16]
Ibn Katheer, may Allah have mercy on him, said in his Tafseer of this aayah:
""‘If two men among you are guilty of lewdness’ means two who commit an immoral act, so 
they should be punished. Ibn ‘Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Sa‘eed ibn Jubayr and 
others said: i.e., by putting them to public shame and hitting them with shoes. This was the 
ruling until Allah abrogated it and replaced it with lashing and stoning. ‘Ikrimah, ‘Ataa’, 
al-Hasan and ‘Abdullah ibn Katheer said: ‘This was revealed concerning a man and a woman 
who commit adultery. The phrase ‘if they repent and amend’ means if they give up what they 
were doing and mend their ways. ‘Leave them alone’ means not to keep rebuking them with 
ugly words after that, because the one who has repented from his sin is like one who never 
sinned at all. ‘Allah is Oft Returning, Most Merciful’ - it was proven in the two Saheehs: ‘If the 
slave woman of one of you commits adultery, apply the punishment of lashing, and do not 
blame her (after that)’ - i.e., do not blame her for what she did after the punishment has been 
given, because the punishment is an expiation for her deed.’""",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

Belief in angels is one of the six pillars of faith without which there is no faith. Whoever does not believe in any of these pillars is not a believer (mumin). These pillars are belief in: Allah, His angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day, and that predestination, both good and bad, comes from Allah.
Who are the Angels?
Angels are a part of the world of the “Unseen” which we cannot comprehend. Allah has told us about them in many places in the Quran and via His Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). There follows a number of proven reports concerning the angels, which hopefully will make you realize the greatness of the Creator and the greatness of this religion which has told us so much about them:
Of what are the Angels created?
They are created from light, as ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) reported: ""The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘The angels are created from light, just as the jinn are created from smokeless fire and mankind is created from what you have been told about.’"" [Muslim].
When were the Angels created?
​​​​​We have no knowledge of precisely when they were created, because there is no text to tell us this. But they were created before mankind for certain, because the Quran says (interpretation of the meaning): ""Behold, your Lord said to the angels: ‘I will create a vicegerent on earth.’"" [2:30] The fact that Allah told them of His intention to create man indicates that they already existed.
The great size of Angels
Allah says concerning the angels of Hell:
""O you who believe! Save yourselves and your families from a Fire whose fuel is men and stones, over which are (appointed) angels stern and severe, who flinch not (from executing) the commands they receive from Allah, but do (precisely) what they are commanded."" [66:6]
The greatest of all the angels is Jibreel, upon whom be peace, who was described in the following report:
""From ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ood (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw Jibreel in his true form. He had six hundred wings, each of which covered the horizon. There fell from his wings jewels, pearls and rubies, only Allah knows about them."" It was reported by Ahmad in al-Musnad, and Ibn Katheer said in al-Bidayah that its isnad (chain of narrators) is jayyid (good).
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, describing Jibreel:
""I saw Jibreel descending from heaven, and his great size filled the space between heaven and earth."" [Muslim].
Among the greatest angels are those who carry the Throne (of Allah), who were described in the following report:
""From Jabir ibn ‘Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who said: ‘I have been given permission to speak about one of the angels of Allah who carry the Throne. The distance between his ear-lobes and his shoulders is equivalent to a seven-hundred-year journey.’"" [Abu Dawood].
Description of Angels
Angels have wings
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
""Praise be to Allah, Who created (out of nothing) the heavens and the earth, Who made the angels messengers with wings - two, or three, or four (pairs) adds to Creation as He pleases: for Allah has power over all things."" [35:1]
Beauty of the Angels
Allah said, describing Jibreel, upon whom be peace (interpretation of the meaning):
""He [the Prophet] has been taught by one Mighty in Power, Dhoo Mirrah (free from any defect in body and mind), then he rose and became stable."" [53:5-6]
Ibn ‘Abbas said: ""‘Dhoo Mirrah means that he has a beautiful appearance."" Qutadah said: ""He is tall and beautiful.""
The idea that angels are beautiful is firmly established in all people’s minds, so much so that they liken a beautiful human to an angel, as the women said about Yoosuf:
"". . . When they [the women] saw him, they did extol him and (in their amazement) cut their hands: they said: ‘Allah preserve us! No mortal is this! This is none other than a noble angel!’"" [12:31]
The differences in size and status of the Angels
The Angels are not all of one size or status; there are differences between them just as there are differences in virtue. The best of them are those that were present at the battle of Badr, as is stated in the hadith narrated by Mu‘adh ibn Rifa‘ah al-Zuraqi from his father, who had been one of the people present at Badr. He said: ""Jibreel came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon Him) and asked, ‘How do you rate the people among you who were present at Badr?’ He said: ‘They are the best of the Muslims,’ or something similar. [Jibreel] said: ‘So it is with the angels who were present at Badr.’"" [al-Bukhaari].
The Angels do not eat or drink
This is indicated by the conversation between Ibrahim, the ""friend"" of Allah, and the angels who visited him. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
""Then he turned quickly to his household, brought out a fatted calf, and placed it before them. He said, ‘Will you not eat?’ (When they did not eat), he conceived a fear of them. They said: ‘Fear not,’ and they gave him glad tidings of a son endowed with knowledge."" [51:26-28]
Elsewhere, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
""But when he [Ibrahim] saw their hands went not towards the (meal), he felt some mistrust of them, and conceived a fear of them. They said: ‘Fear not: we have been sent against the people of Lut.’"" [11:70]
The Angels do not get bored or tired of remembering and worshipping Allah
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
""They celebrate His praises night and day, nor do they ever slacken."" [21:20]
"". . . For in the presence of your Lord are those who celebrate His praises by night and by day. And they never become tired (nor feel themselves above it)."" [41:38]
Number of Angels
The angels are many, and their number is known only to Allah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, describing the Much-Frequented House (al-Bayt al-M’amoor) in the seventh heaven:
""Then I was taken up to the Much-Frequented House: every day seventy thousand angels visit it and leave, never returning to it again, another [group] coming after them."" [al-Bukhaari].
‘Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: ""The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Hell will be brought forth that day by means of seventy thousand ropes, each of which will be pulled by seventy thousand angels."" [Muslim].
Names of Angels
The angels have names, but we know only the names of a few of them. We have to believe in the names reported in the Quran and Sunnah (prophetic teachings) texts, as a part of general belief in the angels. Among the names of angels that are known to us are:
(1) Jibreel and (2) Mikail
""Say: Whoever is an enemy to Jibreel - for he brings down the (revelation) to your heart by Allah’s will, a confirmation of what went before, and guidance and glad tidings to those who believe -
Whoever is an enemy to Allah, and His angels and prophets, to Jibreel and Mikail - Lo! Allah is an enemy to those who reject faith."" [2:97-98]
(3) Israfil
From Abu Salamah ibn ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn ‘Awf, who said: ""I asked ‘Aishah, the Mother of the Believers, about what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to start his prayer with when he got up to pray at night (qiyam al-layl). She said: ‘When he got up to pray at night, he would start his prayer (with the words): ‘O Allah, Lord of Jibreel, Mikail and Israfil, Creator of heaven and earth, Knower of the unseen and the seen, You are the Judge of the matters in which Your slaves differ; guide me with regard to disputed matters of truth by Your permission, for You guide whomever You will to the straight path.’"" [Muslim].
(4) Malik
He is the Keeper of Hell, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""They [the people in Hell] will cry: ‘O Malik! Would that your Lord put an end to us!’"" [43:77]
(5) Munkar and (6) Nakeer
From Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: ""The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘When the deceased is buried (or he said: when one of you is buried), there come to him two blue-black angels, one of whom is called Munkar and the other Nakeer. They ask him, ‘What did you used to say about this man?’ and he says what he used to say: ‘He is the slave and Messenger of Allah: I bear witness that there is no god except Allah and that Muhammad is the slave and Messenger of Allah. They say, ‘We knew beforehand that you used to say this.’ Then his grave will be widened for him to a size of seventy cubits by seventy cubits and it will be illuminated for him. Then they tell him, ‘Sleep.’ He says, ‘Go back to my family and tell them.’ They tell him, ‘Sleep like a bridegroom whom no-one will wake up except his most beloved,’ until Allah raises him up. If (the deceased) was a hypocrite, he says, ‘I heard the people saying something so I said something similar; I do not know.’ They say: ‘We knew beforehand that you used to say this.’ The earth will be told to squeeze him, so he will be crushed until his ribs are interlocked, and he will remain like that until Allah raises him up.’"" [al-Tirmidhi].
(7) Haroot and (8) Maroot
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
"". . . and such things as came down at Babylon to the angels Haroot and Maroot . . ."" [2:102]
"". . . and none can know the forces of your Lord, except He. And this is nothing other than a warning to mankind."" [74:31]
Power of Angels
The angels have great powers given to them by Allah, including the following:
The ability to take on different forms. Allah has given the angels the ability to take on forms other than their own. Allah sent Jibreel to Maryam in the form of a man, as Allah says:
"". . . Then We sent to her Our angel, and he appeared before her as a man in all respects."" [19:17]
Angels also came to Ibrahim in human form, and he did not know that they were angels until they told him so. Similarly, angels came to Lut in the form of young men with beautiful faces. Jibreel used to come to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon Him) in different forms: sometimes he would appear in the form of Dihyah al-Kalbi, a sahaabee (companion) who was very handsome, and sometimes in the form of a Bedouin. The sahaabah (companions) saw him in his human form, as is reported from ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) in the two Saheehs Al-Bukhari and Muslim). (‘Umar) said:
""One day while we were sitting with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), there appeared before us a man whose clothes were exceedingly white and whose hair was exceedingly black; no signs of travel were to be seen on him, and none of us knew him. He walked up and sat down by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Resting his knees against his and placing his hands on his thighs, he said: ‘O Muhammad, tell me about Islam.’..."" [ Muslim].
Many other ahadith (report) refer to the angels taking human forms, such as the hadith (report) about the one who killed a hundred, in which it says "". . . there came to them an angel in human form . . ."" and the hadith about the blind man, the bald man and the leper.
Speed of Angels
The greatest speed known to man today is the speed of light; the angels are able to travel much faster than this. Hardly had an enquirer completed a question to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), but Jibreel would bring the answer from Allah.
Duties of Angels
Among the angels is one whose task it was to convey the revelation from Allah to His Messengers; this is al-Rooh al-Ameen, Jibreel, upon whom be peace. Allah says:
""Say: whoever is an enemy to Jibreel - for he brings down the (revelation) to your heart by Allah’s will. . . "" [2:97]
""Which the trustworthy spirit has brought down, Upon your heart, that you may be (one) of the warners."" [26:193-194]
Another is responsible for rain, directing it wherever Allah wishes. This is Mikail, upon whom be peace. He has helpers, who do what he tells them, by the command of his Lord; they direct the winds and clouds, as Allah wills.
Another is responsible for blowing the Trumpet, which will be blown by Israfil at the onset of the Hour (the Day of Judgement).
Others are responsible for taking people’s souls: these are the Angel of Death and his helpers. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""Say: ‘the Angel of Death, put in charge of you, will (duly) take your souls, then shall you be brought back to your Lord.’"" [32:11] There is no proof in any saheeh hadith (authentic report) that his name is ‘Azrail.
Others are responsible for protecting the slave throughout his life, when he stays home and when he travels, when he is asleep and when he is awake. These are the ""angels in succession"" concerning whom Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
""It is the same (to Him) whether any of you conceals his speech or declares it openly, whether he be hid by night or goes forth freely by day.
For each (person), there are angels in succession, before and behind him. They guard him by the Command of Allah. Verily! Allah will not change the good condition of a people so long as they do not change their state of goodness themselves (by committing sin and by being ungrateful and disobedient to Allah). But when Allah wills a people’s punishment, there can be no turning back of it, and they will find besides Him no protector."" [13:10-11]
Others are responsible for recording the deeds of man, good and bad. These are the ""honourable scribes"" (kiraman katibeen) and are referred to in the ayat/verses (interpretation of the meanings):
"". . . and He sends guardians (angels guarding and writing all of one’s good and bad deeds) over you . . ."" [6:61]
""Or do they think that We hear not their secrets and their private counsel? (Yes, We do) and Our messengers (appointed angels in charge of mankind) are by them, to record.""
[43:80]
""(Remember!) that the two receivers (recording angels) receive (each human being after he or she has attained the age of puberty), one sitting on the right and one on the left (to note his or her actions).
Not a word does he (or she) utter, but there is a watcher by him ready (to record it)."" [50:17-18]
""But verily, over you (are appointed angels in charge of mankind) to watch you,
Kiraman (honourable) katibeen - writing down (your deeds)."" [82:10-11]
Others are responsible for testing people in the grave. These are Munkar and Nakeer. From Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: ""The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘When the deceased is buried (or he said: when one of you is buried), there come to him two blue-black angels, one of whom is called Munkar and the other Nakeer. They ask him, ‘What did you used to say about this man?’ . . ."" [The hadith is quoted in full above]
Some of them are the keepers of Paradise. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
 ""And those who kept their duty to their Lord will be led to Paradise in groups, till, when they reach it, its gates will be opened and its keepers will say: Salamun ‘alaikum (peace be upon you!). You have done well, so enter here, to abide therein."" [39:73]
Some of them are the keepers of Hell, the ""guards of Hell"", whose number is nineteen and whose leader is Malik, upon whom be peace. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
""And those who disbelieved will be driven to Hell in groups, till, when they reach it, the gates thereof will be opened. And its keepers will say, ‘Did not the Messengers come to you from yourselves, - reciting to you the verses of your Lord, and warning you of the meeting of this Day of yours?’ They will say: ‘Yes, but the word of torment has been justified against the disbelievers!’"" [39:71]
""Then, let him call upon his council (of helpers), We will call the guards of Hell (to deal with him)!"" [96:17-18]
 ""And what will make you know exactly what Hell-fire is? It spares not (any sinner), nor does it leave (anything unburnt)! Burning the skins! Over it are nineteen (angels as guardians and keepers of Hell). And We have set none but angels as guardians of the Fire, and We have fixed their number only as a trial for the disbelievers - in order that the People of the Scripture may arrive at a certainty and the believers may increase in faith . . ."" [74:27-31]
""And they will cry: ‘O Malik (Keeper of Hell)! Let your Lord make an end of us.’ He will say: ‘Verily you shall abide forever.’"" [43:77]
One of the angels is responsible for the sperm in the womb, as is mentioned in the hadith (report) of Ibn Mas‘ood (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: ""The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), whose truthfulness is confirmed, said: 
‘The way that each of you is created is that he is gathered in his mother’s womb for forty days as a sperm drop, and then for a similar length of time as a blood-clot, and then for a similar length of time as a lump of flesh. Then an angel is sent and he breathes the spirit into (the foetus), and is charged with four commands: to write down his provision, his life-span, his actions, and whether he will be wretched or happy. By the One besides Whom there is no other god, one of you may do the deeds of the people of Paradise until he is just a cubit away from entering it, then his fate will overtake him and he will begin to do the deeds of the people of Hell, so he will enter Hell; and one of you may do the deeds of the people of Hell until he is just a cubit away from entering it, then his fate will overtake him and he will begin to do the deeds of the people of Paradise, so he will enter Paradise."" [al-Bukhaari, Muslim].
Some angels carry the Throne of Allah, as He describes in the Quran (interpretation of the meaning):
""Those (angels) who bear the Throne (of Allah) and those around it glorify the praises of their Lord, and believe in Him, and ask forgiveness for those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah) (saying): ‘Our Lord! You comprehend all things in mercy and knowledge, so forgive those who repent and follow Your way, and save them from the torment of the blazing Fire!’"" [40:7]
Some of the angels travel throughout the world, seeking out gatherings of dhikr (remembrance of Allah). Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: ""The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon Him) said: 
‘Allah, be He blessed and exalted, has angels who travel the highways seeking out the people of dhikr. When they find people remembering Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, they call out to one another, ""Come to what you hunger for!"" and they enfold them with their wings, stretching up to the lowest heaven. Their Lord asks them, and He knows better than them, ""What are My slaves saying?"" They say: ""They are glorifying, magnifying, praising and extolling You."" He asks, ""Have they seen Me?"" They say, ""No, by Allah, they have not seen You."" He asks, ""And how would it be if they saw Me?"" They say, ""They would be even more fervent and devoted in their praise and worship."" He asks, ""What are they asking me for?"" They say, ""They ask You for Paradise."" He asks, ""And have they seen it?"" They say, ""No, by Allah, O Lord, they have not seen it."" He asks, ""And how would it be if they saw it?"" They say: ""They would be even more eager for it and they would beseech You even more earnestly."" He asks, ""And what do they seek My protection from?"" They say, ""From the Fire of Hell."" He asks, ""Have they seen it?"" They say, ""No, by Allah, they have not seen it."" He asks, ""And how would it be if they saw it?"" They say: ""They would be even more afraid and anxious to escape it."" Allah says: ""You are My witnesses that I have forgiven them."" One of the angels says: ""So-and-so is not really one of them; he came (to the gathering) for some other reason."" Allah says, ""They were all in the gathering, and one of them will not be excluded (from forgiveness)."""" [al-Bukhaari].
Some of them are responsible for the mountains. ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): ""Have you ever faced any day more difficult than the day of Uhud?"" He said: ""I suffered at the hands of your people and the worst that I suffered was what I suffered at their hands on the day of ‘Aqabah. That was when I went to call Ibn ‘Abd Yalayl ibn ‘Abd al-Kalal to Islam, and he did not respond. I left, feeling depressed and hardly knowing where I was going. I did not recover until I found myself in Qarn al-Tha‘alib. I raised my head and saw that I was being shaded by a cloud. I looked, and saw Jibreel in the cloud. He called me and said: ‘Allah has heard what your people said and how they responded to you. He has sent the Angel of the Mountains so that you can tell him to do to them whatever you want.’ The Angel of the Mountains called me and greeted me, then said: ‘O Muhammad, tell me what you want me to do. If you want, I can crush them between two mountains. ’""The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""All I hope for is that Allah will bring forth from their loins people who will worship Allah alone and not associate any partner with Him."" [al-Buhaari].
Some of them visit the Much Frequented House (al-bayt al-m’amoor). In the lengthy hadith describing the Isra and M’iraj (the Night Journey and the Ascent to Heaven), the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:
""Then I was taken up to the Much-Frequented House: every day seventy thousand angels visit it and leave, never returning to it again, another [group] coming after them.""
There are also angels standing in rows, who never get tired or sit down, and others who bow or prostrate, and never raise their heads, as was reported by Abu Dharr, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: ""The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘I see what you do not see and hear what you do not hear. The heaven makes a noise like groaning, and it has the right to (or it is no surprise), for there is no space in it the width of four fingers, but there is an angel there, placing his forehead in sujood (prostration) to Allah. By Allah, if you knew what I know, you would laugh little and weep much, you would not enjoy your relationships with women and you would go out in the street praying to Allah.’"" [ al-Tirmidhi]
This is a summary of Islamic teachings concerning the noble angels of Allah. We ask Allah to make us believe in them and love them. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.

844,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/844,Ruling on operations to repair the hymen,For some reason a woman tore her hymen. Is it permissible for her to have it repaired surgically?,,,"Praise be to Allah.
This matter is one of the issues that
      have been raised in the modern age, so we should look at each of the two
      scholarly opinions on the matter and indicate which one we believe to be
      more correct.
      
       The first opinion is that it is not
      permissible to repair the hymen at all.
 The second opinion is more detailed:
1.If the rupture of the hymen was caused by an accident
      or by an action that is not considered in sharee’ah to be a sin, and was
      not caused by intercourse within the bounds of legal marriage, then we
      look at the following issue:
If
      it is deemed most likely that the girl will suffer hardship and unfair
      accusations because of the customs and traditions of her society, then
      doing this operation is obligatory. If that is not the case, then it is
      still better to do the operation.
2.If the rupture was caused by intercourse within the
      bounds of legal marriage, as in the case of woman who has been divorced,
      or by zinaa (illicit sexual activity i.e., outside the bounds of marriage)
      in a case that is well known among the people, then it is haraam to do
      this operation.
3.If the rupture was caused by zinaa in a case that is
      not well known among the people, then the doctor has the choice of either
      repairing it or not repairing it, although it is better to repair it.
The points on which the scholars differ
 The differences between these two
      opinions are confined to the first and third cases outlined above. With
      regard to the second case, they are agreed that this operation in haraam
      in such situations.
 Evidence (daleel)
The evidence for the first view (that it is
      completely haraam).
 Firstly: repairing the hymen could lead
      to mixing of lineages, as a woman could become pregnant from a previous
      liaison, then she gets marriaed after having her hymen repaired, which
      then leads to the pregnancy being attributed to her husband, thus mixing
      halaal with haraam.
 Secondly: repairing the hymen involves
      looking at that part of the ‘awrah which is to hidden most.
 Thirdly: repairing the hymen makes
      iteasy for young women to commit the sin of zinaa, because they know that
      they can have the hymen repaired afterwards. 
Fourthly: there is the matter of good and bad
      consequences, or pros and cons. If it is possible to achieve the good
      consequences whilst warding off the bad consequences, then we should do
      that. If the bad consequences outweigh the good consequences, we should
      ward off the bad consequences and not worry about the good consequences,
      as the fuqahaa’ of Islam have stated. 
If we apply this principle and look at the
      evil consequences that result from repairing the hymen, we will understand
      that it is not permissible to do this operation because of the enormity of
      the evil consequences that result from it. 
Fifthly: one of the principles of Islamic
      sharee’ah is that something harmful cannot be removed by something else
      that is also harmful. One of the implications of this principle is that
      “it is not permissible for a man to prevent his land from being flooded
      by diverting the flood waters onto someone else’s land.” By the same
      token, it is not permissible for a girl and her mother to remove harm from
      themselves by having the hymen repaired and thus causing harm to the
      husband. 
Sixthly: the basic idea of repairing the hymen
      is not permissible according to sharee’ah because it is a kind of
      deceit, and deceit is forbidden in Islam. 
Seventhly: repairing the hymen pavest he way
      for girls and their families to tell lies about the real reason why the
      hymen was ruptured, and lying is also forbidden in Islam. 
Eighthly: repairing the hymen paves the way
      for doctors to resort to performing abortions for the purposes of
      concealing sin. 
Evidence for the second opinion: 
Firstly: the texts indicate that it is
      permissible and is encouraged to conceal sins, and repairing the hymen
      helps to achieve that in cases where this operation is permissible. 
Secondly: if a woman who is innocent of any
      immoral action is allowed to have this operation so as to leave no room
      for suspicion, this will ward off unjustice for her and will achieve the
      aim prescribed by sharee’ah of thinking well of believing men and women. 
Thirdly: repairing the hymen has to ward off
      harm . If a woman was left without having this operation done, and her
      husband were to notice that, it would cause trouble for her and her
      family, and if the matter became well known among people, the family may
      never be able to find marriage partners for their daughters. So they are
      permitted to ward off harm because they are innocent in this case.
 Fourthly: the fact that a Muslim doctor
      may perform this operation in order to conceal the illusionary evidence of
      has a general educational impact on society, especially where the
      psychology of young women is concerned. 
Fifthly: the objection of deception does not
      exist in cases where we have determined that it is permissible to repair
      the hymen. 
Which view is more correct? 
The view which is more correct- and Allaah knows best – is that which states that it is not
      permissible to repair the hymen at all. This is for the following reasons: 
Fisrtly: because the reports quoted as
      evidence by those who have this view are saheeh. 
Secondly: with regard to the evidence quoted
      by those who favour the second view, they may be dealt with as follows: 
The response to the first :
The concealing that is required in Islam is
      that described in the texts as a concealing of sin, but this aim is not
      achieved by repairing the hymen. Basically it is haraam because it
      involves uncovering the ‘awrah and opens the door to evil. 
The response to the second :
Preventing the husband from thinking badly of
      the woman may be achieved by informing him of the situation before
      marriage. If he accepts it, this is fine, otherwise Allaah will compensate
      her with someone better. 
The response to the third :
The evil consequence mentioned cannot be
      avoided entirely by doing this operation, because there is the possibility
      that the husband may find out about it, even if that happens by way of
      someone else telling him. He should be told about it, and if he accepts
      then the evil consequence is not longer an issue, as is also the case if
      he decides not to go ahead with the marriage. 
The response to the fourth :
Even though there are some positive aspects to
      this concealment, there are also negative consequences, such as making it
      easy for women to commit zinaa. Warding off evil consequences takes
      priority over gaining benefits. 
The response to the fifth :
We do not accept that there is no deception
      involved, because this hymen is renewed, it is not the original hymen. If
      we accept that there is no deception of the husband involved in cases
      where the hymen was broken as a result of jumping and so on, we cannot be
      sure that there is no deception in cases where it was broken as a result
      of an attack on the woman. 
Secondly: blocking the routes that could lead
      to harm, as mentioned by those who favour the first opinion, is a very
      important matter, especially in cases that have to do with the violation
      of the sanctity of private parts and the evil that can undoubtedly result
      from permitting the repair of hymens. 
Thirdly: the basic principle in Islam is that
      it is haraam to uncover, touch or look at that which is ‘awrah. The
      excuses mentioned by those who favour the second opinion are not strong
      enough to let operations to repair the hymen be exempted from this general
      rule. So we have to adhere to this ruling, and say that it is haraam to do
      operations to repair the hymen. 
Fifthly [sic]: the evil consequence of false
      accusations being made can be dealt with by obtaining a medical
      certificate after the event to prove the woman’s innocence. This is the
      best way, and by doing this there is no longer any need to do an operation
      to repair the hymen. 
 For all of these reasons, it is not
      permissible for a doctor or a woman to do this kind of surgery, and Allaah
      knows best.
 (See Ahkaam al-Jaraahah al-Tibbiyyah
      wa’l-Athaar al-Mutarattibah ‘alayhaa  by Dr. Muhammad ibn
      Muhammad al-Mukhtaar al-Shanqeeti, p. 403)
Some contemporary scholars have issued fatwas
      stating that surgery to repair the hymen is permissible in the case of
      rape victims and those who have repented (from zinaa), but it not
      permissible in the case of women who have not repented, because this is
      helping her to continue committing that sin. By the same token, a woman
      who has previously had intercourse is not permitted to do this operation
      because this is helping her to deceive and cheat a future husband, since
      he will think that she is a virgin when this is not the case. And Allaah

Music in a wedding ceremony: Haram?","Praise be to Allah.How to consummate marriage in Islam
When a Muslim wants to consummate his marriage , a number of things are recommended in the sunnah:

He should treat his bride kindly and gently, like offering her something to drink and so on, because of the hadith narrated by Asma bint Yazid ibn al-Sakan, who said: “I prepared ‘Aishah as a bride when she married the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). I came to him and invited him to see her (uncover her face). So he came and sat beside her, and a large cup of milk was brought to him. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) drank some, then offered it to her, but she lowered her head and felt shy. I rebuked her and said: ‘Take it from the hand of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).’ So she took it and drank a little, then the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to her, ‘Give some to your companion (meaning himself).’” (Reported by Imam Ahmad and deemed sahih by al-Albani)

He should place his hand on his bride’s head and pray for her, saying “Bismillah” and asking for barakah (blessing), saying the words reported in the hadith narrated by ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘As, who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When one of you marries a woman or buys a servant, let him say: ‘Allahumma inni as-aluka khayraha wa khayra ma jabaltaha ‘alayhi wa a’udhu bika min sharriha wa min sharri ma jabaltaha ‘alayhi (O Allah, I ask You for her goodness and the goodness which You have created in her, and I seek refuge with You from her evil and the evil which You have created in her).’” Abu Dawud said that Abu Sa’id added: “Then let him take hold of her forelock and pray for blessing from this woman or servant.” (Reported by Abu Dawud in al-Sunan, Kitab al-Nikah, Bab fi jami’ al-nikah; classed as hasan in Sahih al-Jaami’, no. 341)

He should pray two rak’ahs with her, leading her in prayer, because this is reported as being the practice of the salaf (early generations). There are two reports concerning this. (i) from Abu Sa’id, the freed slave of Abu Usayd, which states that a group of the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught him and told him: “When your wife comes in to you, pray two rak’ahs and ask Allah for the goodness of what has come to you, and seek refuge with Him from its evil.” (ii) from Shaqiq, who said: “A man called Abu Hariz came and said (to ‘Abdullah ibn Mas’ud, may Allah be pleased with him): ‘I have married a young virgin girl, but I am afraid that she may hate me.’ ‘Abdullah said: ‘Love comes from Allah and hatred comes from Shaytan, who wants to make you hate what Allah has made permissible. When she comes to you, tell her to pray two rak’ahs behind you.’” (These two reports were narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah; see Adab al-Zafaf by al-Albani).
When he wants to consummate the marriage , he should say the words reported in the hadith reported by Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who said: “When one of you wants to approach (have intercourse with) his wife, if he says: ‘Bismillahi Allahumma jannibna al-Shaytan wa jannib al-Shaytan ma razaqtana (In the name of Allah, O Allah, protect us from Shaytan and protect whatever You give to us from Shaytan)’ – then if they are given a child, Shaytan will not harm it.” (Reported by al-Bukhari, Fath, no. 3271) (For more information, see Adab al-Zafaf by al-Albani, p. 91)

Is there a limit to the number of guests in a wedding feast?
There is no limit to the number of guests one can invite to a wedding feast (walimah), so invite whoever you wish of your relatives, the bride’s relatives, your friends and anyone you have a good reason to invite.
Music in a wedding ceremony: Haram?
It is not permitted in Islam to do anything that is haram such as having music , letting men and women mix, or letting women dance in front of men, or other things that earn the wrath of Allah. How can the blessing of Allah be exchanged for disobedience and immorality? 
At weddings , women can do whatever is allowed in Islam, such as singing acceptable songs with good words or entertaining themselves by playing the daff (a certain kind of drum, resembling a tambourine without the rattles) only, so long as no men are present.
Who should give the wedding walimah?
Providing the wedding feast (walimah) is the husband’s responsibility . The sunnah is to slaughter one sheep or more for the guests, if he is able to, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn ‘Awf, “Give a wedding feast, even if it is only one sheep.” (Reported by al-Bukhari, al-Fath, no. 2048).

861,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/861,Wants to embrace Islam but there are no Muslims Town,"I am very interested in learning more about and embracing the religion of Al-Islam. My problem is that I live in an area that has no Muslim community at all. No places of worship, no study groups, nothing. What is the best way for me to get started learning what I should know?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Al hamdulilah
As soon as you have come to know, dear noble inquirer, that Islam is the true religion of righteousness and the straight path, you should hasten to embrace it and begin practicing the Islamically-prescribed obligations, such as the prayer, etc. Your earning to learn about Islam is a wonderful thing for which you should be commended.
Your unfortunate complaint regarding the absence of a helpful surrounding and a righteous environment is certainly a valid one and to a degree a problem; however, this obstacle no doubt can be overcome by the will of Allaah. For example there are several pages on the Internet that you can use to gain knowledge and benefit. You can also correspond to the various Islamic organizations and publishing houses to get valuable and informative books about Islam. There may be an Islamic center in your town or in a nearby town that you can go to, even if only once a month, to get to know your fellow Muslim sisters and to get advice from them and work with each other in enjoining righteousness and good deeds. Perhaps you can use the internet as an avenue to find out the addresses of Islamic centers in any particular city or state.
If it is possible for you to move to a city where there is a Muslim community or an Islamic center which adheres to true, mainstream Islam (followers of the Sunnah and the united Islamic community), this would be very good. If, in the worst case, may Allaah forbid, lets suppose you don't find even a single Muslim about you, this would not ever prevent you from holding fast to the religion of Islam. In Islam you have an ever-persistent relationship with your Lord; you worship Him and talk to Him and ask Him
guidance, support, and aid in adhering to His religion; you feel His company and security by your prayers to Him your seeking refuge in Him--to an extent that will compensate you more than the absence of anybody else, and will allay your loneliness and the inability to meet fellow sisters in faith and religion. Consider the situation of the followers of our beloved Prophet (peace be upon him) who embraced Islam at its inception. They remained alone and estranged among their tribes and people, each one worshipping Allaah from his place until the Prophet migrated to al-Madinah, at which time they migrated with him and supported him in establishing the Islamic state.
We ask Allaah for your guidance and for you to reply quickly to the call of Allaah and his Prophet (peace be upon him), and we wish you happiness in this life and the hereafter.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

864,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/864,"Bid'ah Hasanah (""Good Innovations"")","I have a question in the area of what is and isn't Bidaa. Over and over again I hear people terming certain actions as Bidaa. I am however confused. Correct me if I am wrong, but isn't there a hadith by Prophet Muhammed that says that anyone who introduces a new helpful hadith will be rewarded. If this is true, then why are all new inovations frowned upon.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly, we should know what ""bid'ah"" means according to Islamic teaching.
It is defined as: any invented way in religion that is aimed at worshipping or drawing closer to Allah. This means anything that is not referred to specifically in Sharee'ah, and for which there is no evidence (daleel) in the Quran or Sunnah, and which was not known at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his Companions. At the same time, it is quite obvious that this definition of religious inventions or innovations, which are condemned, does not include worldly inventions [such as cars and washing machines, etc. - Translator].
 
If your confusion has to do with an apparent contradiction between the hadith narrated by Abu Hurayrah and the hadith narrated by Jareer ibn 'Abdullaah, then let us examine these two reports and find out what they mean:
 
Jareer ibn 'Abdullaah al-Bajali (may Allah be pleased with him) said: ""The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: 'Whoever starts a good thing and is followed by others, will have his own reward and a reward equal to that of those who follow him, without it detracting from their reward in any way. Whoever starts a bad thing and is followed by others, will bear the burden of his own sin and a burden equal to that of those who follow him, without it detracting from their burden in any way.'"" (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, no. 2675. He said, This is a saheeh hasan hadith)
 
There is a story behind this hadith, which will explain what ""whoever starts a good thing"" means. Imaam Muslim reported this story from Jareer ibn 'Abdullaah, who also narrated the hadith itself. He said: ""Some people from the Bedouin came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), wearing woollen garments. He saw that they were in bad shape and in desperate need, so he urged the people to give them charity. They people were very slow to respond, and it could be seen in his face (that he was upset). Then a man of the Ansaar brought a package of silver, then another came, and another and another, and his face was filled with joy. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: 'Whoever starts a good thing in Islam, and others do likewise after him, there will be written for him a reward like that of those who followed him, without it detracting in the least from their reward. Whoever starts a bad thing in Islam, and others do likewise after him, there will be written for him a burden of sin like that of those who followed him, without it detracting in the least from their burden.'"" (Reported by Muslim, no. 1017)
 
Further explanation may be found in a report recorded by al-Nisaa'i, also from Jareer ibn 'Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: ""We were with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) early one day, when some people who were almost naked (not dressed properly) and barefoot, with their swords by their sides, came to him. Most, if not all of them, were of (the tribe of) Mudar. The Messenger's face changed when he saw how poor they were (i.e., he became upset). He went into (his house), then he came out and ordered Bilaal to give the call to prayer. He led the people in prayer, then he addressed them, saying: 'O people, ""be dutiful to your Lord, Who created you from a single person, and from him He created his wife, and from them both he created many men and women, and fear Allah through Whom you demand your mutual (rights), and (do not cut the relations of) the wombs (kinship)"" [al-Nisaa' 4:1].
""Fear Allah, and keep your duty to Him. And let every person look to what he has sent forth for the morrow"" [al-Hashr 59:18].
Let a man give charity from his dinars, his dirhams, his clothing, his wheat or his dates - even if it is only half a date.' A man from the Ansaar brought a package which he could hardly carry in his hand, then another and another came, until there were two piles, of food and clothing, and I saw the face of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) beaming with joy. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: 'Whoever starts a good thing in Islam will have his own reward and a reward equal to that of those who follow him, without it detracting in the least from their reward, and whoever starts a bad thing in Islam will have to bear the burden of his own sin and a burden equal to that of those who followed him, without it detracting in the least from their burden. (Reported by al-Nisaa'i in al-Mujtaba: Kitaab al-Zakaat, Bab al-Tahreed 'ala al-Sadaqah).
From the context of the story, it is clear that what is meant by the words ""whoever starts a good thing (sunnah hasanah) in Islam"" means: Whoever revives a part of the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), or teaches it to others, or commands others to follow it, or acts according to it so that others see him or hear about it and follow his example. This is also indicated by the hadith narrated by Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: ""A man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and he urged the people to give him charity. A man said: 'I have such-and-such,' and there was no person left in the gathering who did not give something in charity to him, whether it was a large amount or a little. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: 'Whoever starts something good, and others follow his lead, will have a complete reward and a reward like that of those who followed him, without it detracting in the least from their reward. Whoever starts something bad, and others follow his lead, will bear a complete burden of sin, and a burden like that of those who followed him, without it detracting in the least from their burden. (Reported by Ibn Maaajah in al-Sunan, no. 204)
It should be clear from the above, with no room for doubt, that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was not allowing innovation in matters of deen (religion), nor was he opening the door to what some people call ""bid'ah hasanah,"" for the following reasons:


The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stated repeatedly that: ""Every newly-invented thing is a bid'ah (innovation), every bid'ah is a going astray, and every going astray will be in the Fire."" (Reported by al-Nisaa'i in al-Sunan, Salaat al-'Eedayn, Baab kayfa al-Khutbah). Reports with the same meaning were narrated via Jaabir (may Allah be pleased with him) by Ahmad, via al-'Irbaad ibn Saariyah by Abu Dawud and via Ibn Mas'ood (may Allah be pleased with him) by Ibn Maajah.
 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say, when beginning a khutbah (sermon): "" The best of speech is the Book of Allah and the best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad. The worst of things are those which are newly-invented, and every innovation is a going astray"" (reported by Muslim, no. 867)
 
If every bid'ah is a going astray, how can some people then say that there is such a thing in Islam as ""bid'ah hasanah""? By Allah, this is an obvious contradiction of the statement and warning of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).


The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stated that whoever innovates something new in the deen (religion) will have his deed rejected, and Allah will not accept it, as is stated in the hadith narrated by 'Aa'ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), who said: ""The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: 'Whoever innovates something in this matter of ours that is not a part of it will have it rejected.'"" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, Fath al-Baari, no. 2697). How can anybody then say that bid'ah is acceptable and it is permitted to follow it?
 

When a person innovates something and adds to the deen something that does not belong to it, he is implying a number of bad things, each worse than the last, for example:


That the religion is lacking, that Allah did not complete and perfect it, and that there is room for improvement. This clearly contradicts the statement in the Quran (interpretation of the meaning): "" This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion"" [al-Maa'idah 5:3]
That the religion remained imperfect from the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) until the time when this innovator came along and completed it with his own ideas.
That the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was ""guilty"" of either of two things: either he was ignorant of this ""good innovation,"" or he knew about it but concealed it, thus letting his ummah down by not conveying it.
That the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), his Companions and the righteous salaf (early generations) missed out on the reward of this ""good innovation"" - until this innovator came along and earned it for himself, despite the fact that he should say to himself, ""If it was truly good, they would have been the first to do it.""
Opening the door to bid'ah leads to changing the deen (religion) and opens the way for personal whims and opinions, because every innovator implies that what he is introducing is something good, so whose opinion are we supposed to follow, and which of them should we take as a leader?
Following bid'ah leads to the cancelling out of sunnah practices and the ways of the salaf. Real life bears witness that whenever a bid'ah is followed, a sunnah practice dies out; the reverse is also true.

We ask Allah to save us from the misguidance of personal whims and from all trials whether they are open or secret. And Allah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
