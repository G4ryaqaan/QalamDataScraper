Is this regarded as a transgression against the rights of others?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.The basic principle is that webmasters put this material on their websites for 
    people to listen to it and benefit from it. Some provide the means of downloading and recording them, so this is regarded as permission from them 
    to copy them. 
Based on this, there is nothing wrong with downloading these lectures and 
    recording them and distributing them to the youth and others, rather this is a beneficial and righteous deed, because it is calling people to 
    Allaah and cooperating in goodness. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever calls people to right guidance 
    will have a reward like that of those who follow him, without that detracting from their reward in the slightest. And whoever calls people to 
    misguidance will have a burden of sin like that of those who follow him, without that detracting from their burden in the slightest.” Narrated by 
    Muslim, 2674, from the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah. 
It is not permissible to try to download lectures from sites that do not allow 
    that, because that is transgressing against the rights of others who have written, compiled, invented etc (i.e., copyright); these are rights that 
    are protected, as it says in the statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council issued during its fifth conference held in Kuwait, 1-6 Jumada al-Awwal 1409 
    AH/ 10-15 December 1988 CE: 
Firstly: trade names, company names, trademarks, writings and inventions are all 
    the copyright of their owners or authors, which in modern practice have acquired monetary value. These rights are respected by sharee’ah and it is 
    not permissible to transgress against them. Copyright of authors and inventors is protected in Islam. 
 .... 
Thirdly: the owner of these rights has the right to dispose of them and no one 
    should transgress against them.

38853,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/38853,He killed a Christian by mistake – should he fast for two consecutive months?,"Allaah decreed that I should hit a Christian person in a car accident, and it was ruled that I was 25% to blame. I have paid the diyah (blood money), but my question is, should I fast for two months or not?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Whoever accidentally kills a Christian who is a dhimmi (one with whom we have a 
    contract or treaty of al-dhimmah (i.e., one who lives in a Muslim state)) or a musta’man (one who has entered the Muslim land and has been 
    guaranteed safety, such as those who come to do business, to work, to visit relatives, and so on) or is partly responsible for his death, must 
    offer expiation (kafaarah), according to the majority of scholars. 
Ibn Qudaamah  (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (12/224): It 
    (expiation) must be offered for killing a kaafir who is protected (by sharee’ah), whether he was a dhimmi or musta’man. This is the view of the 
    majority of scholars). See also the answer to question no. 33683 
As the specialists have ruled that you are partly responsible for this accident, 
    so you are regarded as being partly responsible for this death. If a number of people are responsible for an accidental death, then each one of 
    them must offer expiation in full. This is the view of the four imams. See al-Mughni, 12/226. 
The expiation for accidental killing is to free a slave; if the person cannot do 
    that then he must fast for two consecutive months, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and if he belonged to a people with whom 
    you have a treaty of mutual alliance, compensation (blood money — Diya) must be paid to his family, and a believing slave must be freed. 
    And whoso finds this (the penance of freeing a slave) beyond his means, he must fast for two consecutive months in order to seek repentance from 
    Allaah. And Allaah is Ever All-Knowing, All-Wise”

I want to make up for those days by fasting and feeding a poor person for each day, but I do not know any poor people whom I could feed. 
Is it permissible for me to donate money to any cause such as orphans or to mosques instead of that? And how much is the expiation for each day in Egyptian pounds?","The scholars agreed that the menstruating woman should not fast, and that her fast is not valid if she does fast, and that she has to make up the days that she did not fast in Ramadan because of her period. What you have to do is to make up for those days, and repent to Allah for your failing to seek knowledge which led you to commit this prohibited action.",,"Praise be to Allah.The scholars agreed that the menstruating woman should not fast , and that her fast is not valid if she does fast, and that she has to make up the days that she did not fast in Ramadan because of her period. 
What you have to do is to make up for those days , and repent to Allah for your failing to seek knowledge, which led you to commit this prohibited action. 
If you will be able to make these days up in the same year before the next Ramadan comes , then all you have to do is to make up the fasts, and you do not have to feed the poor. 
However, if you delayed making the fasts up until the next Ramadan came , with no excuse, then there is a difference of scholarly opinion in this case: should you feed the poor as well as make up for the missed fasts, or not? 
We have already stated in the answer to question no. 26865   that you do not have to feed the poor. 
But if you want to be on the safe side, and you feed the poor as well as make up for the missed fasts, that is good. 
What is meant by feeding the poor is feeding one poor person for each day, giving half a Sa` of the local staple food, such as rice or dates. Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) stated that this is approximately equivalent to one and a half kilograms of rice. (Fatawa Ramadan, p. 545) 
The majority of scholars are of the view that it is not sufficient to pay the monetary value of the Fidyah (ransom) , so you cannot pay money; rather you should give the actual food to a poor person, as stated above. 
The Standing Committee was asked about an old man who was not able to fast. They replied: 
“You are allowed not to fast so long as you are unable to do so, and you have to feed one poor person for each day that you do not fast. You can give it all at once or break it up into smaller amounts, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“…and [Allah] has not laid upon you in religion any hardship.” [Al-Hajj 22:78]
It is not enough to give money instead of giving food.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 10/163) 
You can give money to any charitable organization, or to the Imam of a mosque who is known for his religious commitment and righteousness, to buy food on your behalf and distribute it to the poor, and how many there are nowadays. 
You could also make food for the poor, of an amount commensurate with the number of days you owe. Al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “With regard to the old man, if he is unable to fast: for one or two years Anas, after he grew old, fed bread and meat to a poor person every day and did not fast.”  
It is permissible to give this expiation to orphans if they are poor, but not every orphan is poor or needy.

From where should she enter ihraam?","A woman came from Yemen with the intention of doing ‘Umrah, but before she reached the meeqaat she saw menstrual blood, so she went to Jeddah and stayed there for a week. Now she wants to do ‘Umrah. Should she enter ihraam from Jeddah or go to the meeqaat of Yalamlam and enter ihraam from there?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It should be noted that tahaarah (purity) is not a condition of ihraam, and the menstruating woman may enter ihraam for ‘Umrah or Hajj and do all the things that other pilgrims do, except for circumambulating the Ka’bah (tawaaf). It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: “Asma’ bint ‘Umays gave birth to Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr in al- Shajarah, and the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told Abu Bakr to tell her to do ghusl and enter ihraam.” Narrated by Muslim, 1209. Women who are menstruating or bleeding following childbirth come under the same rulings. And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told ‘Aa’ishah, when she was menstruating, to do the same as other pilgrims did, apart from tawaaf around the Ka’bah. Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1516. 
If this woman did not enter ihraam for ‘umrah when she got her period, and she passed the meeqaat without intending to do ‘Umrah, then when she reached Jeddah she decided to do ‘Umrah, then there is nothing wrong with that, and she should enter ihraam from where she is in Jeddah, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever is closer than that should (enter ihraam) from where he forms the intention.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1524; Muslim, 1181 – i.e., whoever is closer than the meeqaat should enter ihraam from where he is. 
But if she intended to do ‘Umrah from the moment she passed or came in line with  the meeqaat, but she did not enter ihraam from that point, then she has to go back and enter ihraam from the meeqaat. If she does not do that and she enters ihraam from Jeddah, then she has to offer a sacrifice and slaughter a sheep in Makkah, and distribute it to the poor and needy of the Haram. 
Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: In conclusion, whoever passes the meeqaat without ihraam, intending to perform the rituals, has to go back to it and enter ihraam from there, if he can, whether he passed it knowingly or unknowingly, whether he knew that this is haraam or not. If he goes back to it and enters ihraam from there, then he does not have to do anything else, and we do not know of any differing opinion concerning that. This is the view of Jaabir ibn Zayd, al-Hasan, Sa’eed ibn Jubayr, al-Thawri, al-Shaafa’i and others, because he has entered ihraam from the meeqaat from which he was commanded to enter ihraam, so he does not have to do anything. But if he entered ihraam from a point closer to Makkah than the meeqaat, then he has to offer a sacrifice.

38881,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/38881,Is it obligatory to pray jamaa’ah in a mosque that is far from the house?,"I have a husband who is religiously-committed and he knows that it is obligatory to pray in the mosque when one can hear the adhaan. In our neighbourhood there is a mosque that is about ten minutes away on foot, but we can never hear the adhaan because our house is on a main street. Moreover, Muslims in this country are afraid of making the adhaan very loud lest that provoke the Christians. My husband does not go and pray in the mosque except when it is on his way when he goes out for some other purpose. And the imam prays in a way that is slightly different and he does not like it. This upsets me a great deal, I hope that you can tell me the ruling on his actions because I am afraid he may be committing a sin.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Praying in jamaa’ah (congregation) in the mosque is one of the most important rituals of Islam, and it is obligatory for every man past the age of adolescence who is able to hear the call to prayer, because of a great deal of evidence, including the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Whoever hears the call to prayer and does not respond, his prayer is not valid, except the one who has an excuse.”
Narrated by Ibn Maajah, 793; also narrated by al-Daaraqutni and al-Haakim, who classed it as saheeh. It was also classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah. 
Muslim narrated (653) that Abu Hurayrah said: A blind man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, “O Messenger of Allah, I do not have anyone to lead me to the mosque,” and he asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to grant him a concession allowing him to pray in his house. He granted him that concession, then when he turned to leave he called him back and said, “Can you hear the call to prayer?” He said, “Yes.” He said, ‘Then answer it.” 
And there is other evidence too. 
What is meant by hearing the call to prayer is hearing it with the voice that is ordinarily used, without amplification, when other noises are still and there is nothing to prevent hearing the adhaan. It should also be noted that the muezzins at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to give the call to prayer from high places, such as the roof of the mosque and the like, and the way the houses were built was conducive to the sound reaching far and wide.  
Based on this, a distance of ten minutes on foot is regarded as a distance which the sound of the adhaan would ordinarily reach under the conditions described above; indeed it would reach further than that. 
So your husband has to observe this ritual in the mosque so long as it is free from anything that is regarded in sharee’ah as an impediment. See question no. 20655. 
The fact that a man is not obliged to pray in jamaa’ah because of distance etc does not mean that he should not pay attention to that and seek to raise himself in status by striving to attend the prayers. How much goodness there is to be attained by praying in congregation in the mosque, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Prayer offered in a group is twenty-five times better than prayer offered at home or in the marketplace. If any one of you does wudoo’ and does it well, then comes to the mosque for no other purpose than to pray, then he does not take a single step but Allah raises him in status one degree thereby and removes one sin from him, until he enters the mosque. Then he is in a state of prayer so long as he is waiting for the prayer, and the angels send blessings upon him so long as he remains in the spot where he prayed, saying ‘O Allah, forgive him, O Allah, have mercy on him,’ so long as he does not pass wind.”
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 465; Muslim, 649. 
Who among us does not want his status to be raised and his sins erased, and to have the angels of the Most Merciful pray for forgiveness for him?? 
So your husband should strive to pray in congregation in the mosque and to be with the Muslims and show strength of numbers. He should understand that when the Muslims are steadfast in adhering to their religion and keeping its rituals and symbols alive, these are some of the most important factors in making them stand firm and prevail over their enemies; indeed this steadfastness is a kind of da’wah that has an effect on the hearts of others.  
The father should also set a good example to his wife and children. How can his sons get used to frequenting the mosque when they see him never going to the mosque except when he has to go out for some worldly need? Allah praises those who frequent the mosques, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The mosques of Allah shall be maintained only by those who believe in Allah and the Last Day; perform As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as-Salaah), and give Zakaah and fear none but Allah. It is they who are on true guidance”
[al-Tawbah 9:18]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said that the virtue of prayer offered in congregation is for the one who goes out to attend the prayer and does not go out for any other purpose, as he said: “… then comes to the mosque for no other purpose than to pray”, as in the hadeeth quoted above. 
We should understand an important point, which is that a group of the fuqaha’ did not think that prayer in congregation is obligatory, as is the well-known view of the Hanafi fuqaha’, but that did not prevent thousands, nay millions, of Muslims who followed this madhhab, from praying in congregation and persisting in doing so even in the most difficult of circumstances, in the Balkans, Turkey, eastern Europe and elsewhere. It is not the matter of whether it is obligatory or not, rather it is the matter of strong faith that motivates a person to emulate his Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his noble Companions, and wanting nothing less than the highest degrees of Paradise.  
A Sahaabi would come leaning on two other men because of sickness, so that he could stand in the row of worshippers, even though he would be excused if he did not come and pray in congregation. What was it that motivated him? His faith. 
The one who is keen does not ask whether it is obligatory or not, rather he is keen to follow the Sunnah and the way of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).  
Ibn Mas’ood (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Whoever would like to meet Allah tomorrow as a Muslim, let him offer these prayers regularly when the call to prayer is given, for what Allah has prescribed for your Prophet is guidance and this is part of that guidance. If you were to pray in your houses as this man who stayed home did, you would have given up one of the Sunnahs of your Prophet, and if you give up a Sunnah of your Prophet you will go astray. There is no man who does wudoo’ and does it well, then goes to one of these mosques, but for every step he takes Allah will record one hasanah (good deed) for him, and erase one bad deed. There was a time when no one stayed away from the prayer but a hypocrite whose hypocrisy was well known, and a man would come supported by two others so that he could stand in the row.” Narrated by Muslim, 654. 
What we have mentioned about hearing the call to prayer is what was stated in a fatwa by Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him), when he was asked about a man who lives in a house far away from the mosque and has to use a car to go to the prayers because if he goes on foot he sometimes misses the prayer, but he can hear the adhaan over the loudspeakers. Is there any sin on him if he prays at home with three or four neighbours in the home of one of them? 
The Shaykh replied: 
You have to pray with your Muslim brothers in the mosque, if you can hear the adhaan in your home at a normal volume without the aid of loudspeakers, when other sounds are silent and there is nothing to prevent you from hearing it. 
If you are far away and cannot hear the adhaan without the loudspeakers, it is permissible for you to pray in your house or with some of your neighbours, because it was proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to the blind man when he asked him for permission to pray in his house: “Can you hear the call to prayer?” He said, “Yes.” He said, “Then answer it.” Narrated by Imam Muslim in his Saheeh. 
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever hears the call to prayer and does not come, there is no prayer for him [i.e., his prayer is not valid], except for the one who has an excuse.” Narrated by Ibn Maajah, al-Daaraqutni, Ibn Hibbaan and al-Haakim with a saheeh isnad. If you answer the call of the muezzin even though you live far away and you take the trouble to come on foot or by car, then that is better for you, and Allah will reward your footsteps to and from the mosque, so long as you are sincere and have the right intention, because it was narrated that there was a man who lived far from the Prophet’s Mosque but he never missed a prayer with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). It was said to him, “Why do you not buy a donkey that you can ride when it is hot and when it is very dark at night?” He said, “I would not like my house to be close to the mosque, for I want my walking to the mosque and back to my family to be recorded.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him, “Allah will grant you all of that.” Narrated by Imam Muslim in his Saheeh.

    If a person has bought land with the intention of selling it 
    after a while, one of the following two scenarios must apply: 

    1 – He aims to save the money so that he will not spend it on 
    anything else, but he does not intend to trade or make a profit. In this 
    case there is no zakaah on the land. 

    See question no. 34802 

    2 – He does intend to trade and make a profit, in which case 
    this land comes under the heading of trade goods, so zakaah must be paid on 
    it. 

    The value of trade goods should be worked out at the end of 
    one year on the basis of their current value, not the price for which they 
    were bought, and the zakaah must be paid on them. The rate of zakaah that 
    must be paid is one-quarter of one-tenth, i.e., 2.5%. 

    For example: if you bought land for one hundred thousand 
    riyals, and when zakaah becomes due on it its value is now one hundred and 
    fifty thousand riyals, then when one year had passed you must pay the zakaah 
    of one hundred and fifty thousand riyals. The converse also applies. If you 
    bought it for one hundred thousand riyals and when one year has passed its 
    value is now only fifty thousand riyals, then you only have to pay zakaah on 
    fifty thousand riyals. 

    See Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 9/334; Fataawa 
    wa Rasaa’il al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 18/205, 236 

    Note: 
It should be noted that 
    the year for reckoning zakaah on trade goods does not begin from the time 
    one bought the land or other product, rather it begins from the time when 
    the wealth with which you bought those goods reached the nisaab (minimum 
    threshold).

     Based on this, the year for this land is the year for the 
    money with which you bought it.

Can they go back to their spots after that? Is that regarded as stepping over people? I hope that you can explain the subject of stepping over people.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: Whoever sits in a place in the mosque and gets up for a reason, such as doing wudoo’ etc., then returns to it, has more right to it, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever gets up from his spot then returns to it is more entitled to it.” Narrated by Muslim, 2179. 
And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “A man is more entitled to his spot; if he leaves for a reason then comes back to it, he is more entitled to his spot.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2751; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 3544. 
We have already explained this in the answer to question no. 66279 
The one who sits there must get up if the first person comes back. 
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This is the correct view according to our companions, and the one who has sat there must leave if the first one comes back to it. Some of the scholars said: This is mustahabb and is not obligatory. This is the view of Maalik. But the former view is the one that is correct. 
Sharh al-Nawawi ‘ala Muslim, 14/162. 
This applies if he leaves his spot for a reason, then comes back to it. But if he leaves it for no reason, then he forfeits his right to it, and there is no scholarly difference of opinion on this point. This was stated by al-Nawawi in al-Majmoo’, 4/420. 
Secondly: If returning to his spot means that he will step over people, then the ruling should be based on the ruling on these two matters: stepping over people, and stepping over people in order to reach a gap in the front row. 
As for stepping over people, the scholars differed and there are two views. Some scholars were of the view that it is makrooh, and others are of the view that it is haram. 
In the answer to question no. (41731), we have discussed that, and stated that the correct view is that it is haram. 
This is the first issue. The second issue is the ruling on stepping over people in order to reach a gap in the front row. 
Ibn Qudamah said in al-Mughni (2/101): 
If he sits in a place, then he leaves it because he wants to do something or he needs to do wudoo’, he may leave [i.e., even if that means that he has to step over people] ‘Uqbah said: I prayed ‘Asr behind the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in Madeenah, then he said the salaam then he got up quickly and stepped over the people until he reached the apartment of one of his wives, and he said: “I remembered some gold nuggets that we had and I did not want to be distracted by it, so I gave instructions that it be shared out.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari… If he gets up and leaves his spot then comes back, he has more right to it… The ruling with regard to stepping over people in order to reach one’s spot is the same as one who sees a gap in front of him. End quote. 
He also said: 
If he sees a gap which he can only reach by stepping over people, two views have been narrated concerning this. According to one view, he may step over them. Ahmad said: A man go forward as far as he can, and he should not leave any empty space in front of him. If he is unaware of that and he leaves an empty space in front of him, one who comes after him should fill it and pass by him to reach the empty space. There is no “sanctity” for one who has left an empty space in front of him and has sat elsewhere. Al-Awzaa’i said: He should move past them to the space. Qataadah said: He may move past them to the spot where he wants to pray. Al-Hasan said: Step over those who are sitting at the doors of the mosque, for they have no sanctity. Another report was narrated from Ahmad, according to which there is nothing wrong with stepping over one or two, because it is an insignificant matter and may be overlooked, but if one steps over many people, we regard that as makrooh. This was also the view of al-Shaafa’i. But if there is no other way to reach the spot where one will pray, then he may step over people, in sha Allah. Perhaps the view of Ahmad and those who agreed with him in the first report applies to those who have left a wide space, like those who form rows at the back of the mosque and leave empty rows in front of them, who have no sanctity as al-Hasan said, because they have gone against the command of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and have turned away from the best rows and sat in the worst, and because there is no option but to step over them; and his other opinion has to do with those who have not been heedless, because the rows in front of them are full, and they sat wherever they could. If it is not possible to pray without squeezing in and stepping over them, then it is permissible, because that is a case of need. End quote. 
Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmoo’ (4/420): 
If he sees a gap in front of them, and he cannot reach it except by stepping over them, then our companions said that it is not makrooh to step over them, because those who are sitting behind it have been negligent in not filling the gap, whether there are other gaps or not, and whether it is close to them or not. But if there is another spot available, it is better not to step over them. If there is a closer spot and he can reach it without stepping over more than two men, then he may go there. If it is far away and he hopes that they will move forward and fill it when the iqaamah for prayer is given, then it is mustahabb for him to sit where he is and not step over people, otherwise he may do that. And it is narrated that Qataadah said: He may step over them to reach his spot. It was narrated from Abu Nasr that it is permissible to do that with their permission. Ibn al-Mundhir said: It is not permissible to do any of that in my view, because it is haram to cause annoyance, whether a lot or a little. End quote. 
Al-Haafiz narrated in Fath al-Baari (2/433) that Imam al-Shaafa’i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
It is makrooh to step over people, except for one who cannot find a place to pray except by doing that. End quote. 
Then al-Haafiz said: This includes the imam and anyone who wants to reach a broken row if those who came before him refuse to do so, and one who wants to reach a spot that he left for a necessary reason. End quote. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 5/70: 
If someone were to say: the hadeeth “Sit for you have caused annoyance” is general in meaning, because the apparent situation is that there was a gap, because people do not usually step over others unless there is a gap, our response is that: 
The fuqaha’ (may Allah have mercy on them) made an exception in this case and said: Because if there is a gap, they are the ones who have wronged themselves, because they have gone against the command to fill the gaps in the rows, and in that case the negligence is on their part, and is not the fault of the one who steps over them. 
But what I think is that he should not step over them even if there is a gap because the reason, which is annoyance, is still present. There may be some reason why they did not go forward and fill the gap, such as if the gap is not large but it became larger as people shifted position. In that case it is not negligence on their part, so it is better to follow the general meaning which is that he should not step over people to reach the gap. But if he steps over some people and asks permission to do so in order to reach this gap, then I hope that there is nothing wrong with that. End quote. 
The point is that with regard to stepping over people, one of the following two scenarios must apply: 
1 – That it is done for no reason. This is haram because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And those who annoy believing men and women undeservedly, they bear (on themselves) the crime of slander and plain sin”
[al-Ahzaab 33:58]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to a man who stepped over people: “Sit down, for you are causing annoyance.” 
2 – That it is done for a reason, in which case there is nothing wrong with it in sha Allah. This includes a number of things such as: 
-The imam, if he cannot find a way to reach his place except by stepping over people
-One who wants to leave his spot for a reason, because of the hadeeth quoted above
-If a person is sitting in a front row then he gets up for some reasons and then comes back, it is permissible for him to step over people.
To sum up our answer: 
There is nothing wrong, in sha Allah, with stepping over people in order to return to a spot which one has left, so long as that is done in a polite manner, asking people’s permission. People are usually tolerant of one who is stepping over them to return to a spot that he had left.
