Is there anything special about this month compared with other months?,"The best fasting after Ramadan is fasting in al-Muharram. So, it is encouraged to fast a lot in the month of al-Muharram, not to fast the whole month.","Virtues of al-Muharram


Fasting in al-Muharram","Praise be to Allah.Virtues of al-Muharram
The month of al-Muharram is the first month of the Arabic year, and it is one of the four sacred months of Allah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, the number of months with Allah is twelve months (in a year), so was it ordained by Allah on the Day when He created the heavens and the earth; of them four are Sacred (i.e. the 1st, the 7th, the 11th and the 12th months of the Islamic calendar). That is the right religion, so wrong not yourselves therein.” [al-Tawbah 9:36]
Al-Bukhari (3167) and Muslim (1679) narrated from Abu Bakrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The division of time has turned to its original form which was current the day Allah created the heavens and earth. The year consists of twelve months of which four are sacred: three consecutive months, Dhu’l-Qa’dah, Dhu’l-Hijjah and al-Muharram, and Rajab of Mudar which comes between Jumada and Sha’ban.” 
Fasting in al-Muharram
It was proven from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that the best fasting after Ramadan is fasting in the month of al-Muharram . Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The best fasting after Ramadan is the month of Allah al-Muharram, and the best prayer after the obligatory prayer is prayer at night.” (Muslim, 1163) 
With regard to the phrase “the month of Allah”, mentioning the month in conjunction with Allah is a sign of its great status. Al-Qari said: it seems that what is meant is all of the month of al-Muharram. 
But it was proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not fast any month in full apart from Ramadan, so this hadith is to be understood as meaning that it is encouraged to fast a lot in the month of al-Muharram, not to fast the whole month.

21316,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21316,Chain letter telling lies about Zaynab,"There is a chain letter which reads as follows: 

“In the name of Allaah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.Blessings and peace be upon the most noble of the Prophets and Messengers, our master Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and upon his family and companions. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

‘No doubt! Verily, the Awliyaa’ of Allaah, no fear shall come upon them nor shall they grieve’ [Yoonus 10:62] 

Allaah the Almighty has spoken the truth. 

My dear Muslim brother/sister. A 13-year-old girl fell ill. She was very sick and the doctors were unable to cure her. One night her sickness became very bad and she cried herself to sleep. In her dream she saw that al-Sayyidah Zaynab (may Allaah be pleased with her) put drops in her mouth. When she woke up she was fully recovered from her sickness. Al-Sayyidah Zaynab (may Allaah be pleased with her) asked her to write out this story 13 times and distribute it among the Muslims, so that they might learn about the power of the Creator and how His power manifests itself in His creation, glorified be He above that which they associate with Him. So the girl did what was asked of her, and what happened was the following:  

1 – The first copy ended up in the hands of a poor man, who wrote it out and distributed it; 13 days later, Allaah willed that this poor man should become rich.

2 – The second copy ended up in the hands of a worker who ignored it; 13 days later he lost his job.

3 – The third copy ended up in the hands of one of the rich people who refused to write it out; 13 days later he lost all his wealth. 

After reading this story, my Muslim brother/sister, hasten to write it out 13 times and distribute it among the people, then you will get what you wish for from Allaah. May Allaah bless our master Muhammad and all his family and companions.” 

How correct is this chain letter, and what is the ruling on distributing it?",,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          When I examined this fabricated chain letter I thought 
          that it is my duty to comment on the claims made by its author, connecting 
          benefits and interests to the one who writes it out and distributes 
          it, and harm to the one who ignores it and does not pass it on. This 
          is a lie which has no sound basis; rather it is the fabrication of liars 
          and imposters who want to divert the Muslims from putting their trust 
          in their Lord alone, with no partner or associate, to bring them benefits 
          and ward off harm, whilst also taking the means that are prescribed 
          in sharee’ah and are permissible, and who want to make them put their 
          trust in and focus on something other than Allaah in seeking to gain 
          benefits and to ward off harm, and seek false means that are neither 
          prescribed in Islam nor permissible, and to call people to depend on 
          and worship something other than Allaah. 
 
          Undoubtedly this is one of the plots of the enemies of 
          the Muslims who want to divert them from the true religion by any means 
          possible. The Muslims have to beware of these plots and not be deceived 
          by them. They should not be deceived by this chain letter and similar 
          letters which surface from time to time. We have previously drawn attention 
          to a number of them. It is not permissible for a Muslim to write these 
          chain letters or to distribute them under any circumstances whatsoever. 
          That is an evil action and the one who does it is sinning. There is 
          the fear that he may be subjected to punishment in this world or in 
          the Hereafter, because this is a form of bid’ah (innovation); bid’ah 
          is a great evil and its consequences are severe. 
 
          This kind of chain letter is a form of reprehensible 
          innovation, and is one of the means that lead to shirk and exaggeration 
          about the Ahl al-Bayt (members of the Prophet’s household) and others 
          among the dead, and may lead to people calling upon them besides Allaah 
          and seeking their help and believing that they may being benefit or 
          cause harm to those who call upon them and seek their help. It is also 
          a form of telling lies against Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of 
          the meaning): 
 
          “It is only those who believe not in the Ayaat (proofs, 
          evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allaah, who 
          fabricate falsehood, and it is they who are liars”[al-Nahl 16:105]
 
          And the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever innovates 
          anything in this matter of ours (i.e., Islam) that is not part of it 
          will have it rejected.”  (Saheeh, agreed upon). 
 
          All Muslims who receive this chain letter or similar 
          letters should tear them up and destroy them, and warn people against 
          them. They should not pay any attention to promises or threats mentioned 
          therein, because these are false letters which have no sound basis and 
          will not result in anything, good or bad. But those who fabricate them, 
          write them out, distribute them, advocate them and spread them among 
          the Muslims are committing sin, because all of that is a kind of co-operating 
          in sin and transgression, which Allaah forbade in His Book when He said 
          (interpretation of the meaning): 
 
          “Help you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwa 
          (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin 
          and transgression. And fear Allaah. Verily, Allaah is Severe in punishment”[al-Maa’idah 
          5:2]
 
          We ask Allaah to keep us and the Muslims safe and sound 
          from all evil. Allaah is Sufficient for us and He is the best disposer 
          of affairs, the best to deal with those who fabricated this and similar 
          chain letters and introduced into the religion of Allaah something that 
          is not part of it. We ask Allaah to deal with them as they deserve, 
          because they have told lies against Allaah and propagated those lies, 
          and called the people to the means of shirk and exaggeration about the 
          dead, and to occupy themselves with something that will cause them harm 
          and bring them no benefits. These comments have been written out of 
          sincerity towards Allaah and His slaves.

21341,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21341,Raising one’s hands for du`a when travelling,"Is it prescribed to raise the hands when making du`a, especially when travelling by plane or car or train, etc?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Raising the hands when making du`a is one of the means of having the du`a answered in any place. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Your Lord is characterized by modesty and concealment, so if a slave of His raises his hands (in supplication), He does not return them to him empty.” 
And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah is Good and does not accept anything but that which is good. Allah has enjoined upon the believers that which He enjoined upon the Messengers.” Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe (in the Oneness of Allah — Islamic Monotheism)! Eat of the lawful things that We have provided you with, and be grateful to Allah” [al-Baqarah 2:172]
And He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O (you) Messengers! Eat of the Tayyibaat [all kinds of Halaal (lawful) foods which Allah has made lawful (meat of slaughtered eatable animals, milk products, fats, vegetables, fruits)] and do righteous deeds” [al-Mu’minoon 21:51]
Then he mentioned a man who travels a great deal and becomes disheveled and covered with dust, who raises his hands to the heavens (and says), ‘O Lord, O Lord,’ when his food is haram, his drink is haram, his clothes are haram and he has been nourished with haram, so how can he receive a response?
 (Narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh). 
So he described raising the hands as being one of the means of having du`a answered, and he described consuming haram and nourishing oneself with haram as being among the reasons why prayers are not answered.
 So this indicates that raising the hands is one of the means of having du`a answered, whether that is in a plane, train, car, spaceship or whatever. If a person makes du`a and raises his hands, this is one of the means of having one’s du`a answered. But in situations where the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not raise his hands, we should not raise our hands either, such as in the khutbah of Jumu’ah, where he did not raise his hands except when praying for rain (istisqa’), when he did raise his hands.
 Similarly, between the two prostrations and before saying the salaam at the end of the Tashahhud, he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not raise his hands, so we do not raise our hands at these times when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not raise his hands.
 Because his doing it is evidence and his not doing it is evidence. Similarly after the salaam of the five daily prayers, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would recite the dhikrs prescribed in sharee’ah but he did not raise his hands, so we do not raise our hands either, following his example. But in the situations when he did raise his hands, the Sunnah is to raise our hands, following his example, and because that is one of the means of having our prayers answered. Similarly in situations where a Muslim calls upon his Lord, and it was not narrated whether the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) raised his hands or not, then we should raise our hands then, because of the ahaadeeth that indicate that raising the hands is one of the means of having prayers answered, as mentioned above.","Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat li’l-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 6/124"

For those whose presence is required in the

    pray where they are with the jamaa’ah that they are able to pray with. 
But for those who can reach the mosque, they 
    have to do so, in accordance with the shar’i evidence, such as the hadeeth in which the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said: “Whoever hears the call to prayer and does not respond, there is no prayer for him (his prayer is not valid), except for those who have an 
    excuse.” It was said to Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him), What is the excuse? He said, Fear or sickness. (Narrated by Ibn Maajah and

21350,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21350,Is it permissible to change a vowed action to something better?,"If I have made a vow, is it permissible to change the action and place to another action and place? After I made the vow, I realized that a different action and place would be better than the first.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Yes, it is permissible to change the action mentioned in a 
    vow to something that is better. 

    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in al-Ikhtiyaaraat 
    (p. 329): 

    Whoever vows to observe a specific fast can change it to a 
    better time. End quote. 

    For example, if a person vowed to fast on Tuesday, then he 
    may fast on Monday instead because that is better. 

    The Standing Committee was asked about changing a vowed 
    action to something that is better than the first. They replied: 

    The basic principle is that if a man mentions a specific 
    place in his vow, such as a vow to give charity or build a mosque in a 
    specific place, he is obliged to fulfil that vow in the place and manner 
    specified, so long as there is no shar’i reason not to do so, unless he 
    changes it to a place that is better, such as the two Holy Sanctuaries 
    (Makkah and Madeenah). There is nothing wrong with that. This is indicated 
    by the words of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    to the man who had vowed to sacrifice a camel in Bawaanah. He said: “Were 
    there any idols of the Jaahiliyyah there that were worshipped?” He said: No. 
    He said: “Were any of their festivals held there?” He said: No. He said: 
    “Then fulfil your vow.” 

    He commanded him to fulfil his vow in the place that he had 
    specified because there were no reasons why he should not do so. The fact 
    that a vowed action may be moved to a better place is indicated by the fact 
    that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to a 
    man who had vowed to pray in Bayt al-maqdis (Jerusalem): “Pray here.” The 
    man repeated his statement and he said, “Pray here.” The man repeated his 
    statement again and he said: “It’s up to you.” Narrated by Abu Dawood and 
    Ahmad. 

    And Allaah is the Source of strength. May Allaah send 
    blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and 
    companions.

21356,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21356,Should he leave home because of his sisters’ bad behaviour?,"My life has fallen into a great difficulty. my sisters have behaved badly. because of this, my father does not want to stay with us so is living in pakistan. but my sisters have got round my mother and they will not repent for their evil ways. my iman has become a joke for them. they have haram relationships. in their ignorance they taunt me that i will marry my cousin and they say it is illegal. i feel evil all around me. i am slowly becoming an outcast in my family just as my father became. i am losing my mind. i have no inner peace and when i do it doesnt last. i feel helpless. every day is a difficulty for me. i have conditioned myself to cope with the terrible situations in my family. i feel stressed. i cannot concentrate on anything. 

 please brother can you give me some advice - should i leave home? should i stay with my father in Pakistan? please can you tell me if Allah is testing me or cleansing me of my sins.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    Your father made a grave mistake when he left the house and 
    went back to his own country. Allaah has entrusted him with something and he 
    has neglected that trust. What he should have done was to stay with his 
    children in order to discipline them, look after them and take care of their 
    affairs. Perhaps it is your father’s leaving that made your sisters’ 
    behaviour even worse. 

    So we advise you, first of all, to convince your father, as a 
    matter of necessity, to come back to his wife and children, so that he can 
    take care of them and discipline them, or for all of them to join him in 
    Pakistan – even if that is done by force or by trickery – and perhaps that 
    would be better, because your staying in that land where there is kufr, 
    evildoing and moral laxity is what is affecting your sisters’ attitude and 
    behaviour. 

    Secondly: 

    Your mother, likewise, has to fear Allaah with regard to her 
    daughters and not give them free rein. Now she has taken on a heavy burden 
    of responsibility, especially since your father has left. So she should not 
    take things lightly with regard to her daughters. Your mother has to realize 
    the seriousness of what your sisters are doing and the damage their actions 
    may do to all of you in this world, and the sin which will be upon them in 
    the Hereafter and upon those who approved of their actions or who allowed 
    them to do that and made it easy for them to do evil actions. 

    Thirdly: 

    You have to be patient and to give thought to every action 
    before you do it. Staying with them is not entirely good, and leaving them 
    is not entirely good. Rather the matter depends on the effects of your 
    staying and the effects of your leaving. If your staying in the home will 
    affect your religious commitment and your sanity, and make you fall into 
    sin, then we advise you to leave. If your leaving will make their behaviour 
    worse and your staying will not affect your religious commitment and sanity, 
    then it is haraam for you to leave, because your leaving may make the sin 
    worse, which would mean that you were neglecting your responsibility and 
    being careless about that which has been entrusted to you. 

    Fourthly: 

    Perhaps this is a test from Allaah for you, to expiate for 
    your bad deeds and to raise you in status, not a punishment. Hence we advice 
    you to be patient, not to make any hasty decisions, to make du’aa’ and to 
    beseech your Lord to guide your sisters to be good and chaste. We advise you 
    to look for means of guiding them such as getting them married, looking for 
    good sisters for them to mix with, moving house, and so on. Perhaps when 
    Allaah sees that you are sincere, He will help you and will guide your 
    sisters and your mother, and will unite the family in religious commitment 
    and goodness. For He is able to do that and He is the Guide to the Straight 
    Path. 

    We will tell you the following story, from which you may 
    learn a lesson: 

    It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: I used to call my 
    mother to Islam when she was a mushrikah. I called her one day and she said 
    something about the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) that I did not like to hear. So I went to the Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) weeping, and said, 
    “O Messenger of Allaah, I have been calling my mother to Islam, but she 
    refuses. I called her today and she said something about you that I did not 
    like to hear. Pray to Allaah to guide the mother of Abu Hurayrah.” The 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, 
    “O Allaah, guide the mother of Abu Hurayrah.” I went out feeling optimistic 
    because of the du’aa’ of the Prophet of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him). When I came home and reached the door, I saw that it 
    was slightly ajar. My mother heard my footsteps and said, “Stay where you 
    are, O Abu Hurayrah!” and I could hear the trickling of water. She took a 
    bath and got dressed, and put on her headcover, then she opened the door and 
    said, “O Abu Hurayrah, I bear witness that there is no god except Allaah, 
    and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger!” I went back to 
    the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), 
    and I came to him weeping with joy. I said, “O Messenger of Allaah, rejoice, 
    for Allaah has answered your prayer and guided the mother of Abu Hurayrah.” 
    So he praised Allaah and said good words. I said, “O Messenger of Allaah, 
    pray to Allaah to make my mother and me beloved to His believing slaves, and 
    to make them beloved to us.” The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “O Allaah, make this slave of Yours – 
    meaning Abu Hurayrah – and his mother beloved to Your believing slaves, and 
    make the believers beloved to them.” So there are no believing people who 
    hear of me even though they do not see me, but they love me.

Useful story on how to how to deal with angry child
There follows a lovely story which will help you to deal with angry children : 
There was a boy who was always losing his temper. His father gave him a bag full of nails and said to him, “My son, I want you to hammer a nail into our garden fence every time you need to direct your anger against something and you lose your temper.” 
So the son started to follow his father’s advice. On the first day he hammered in 37 nails, but getting the nails into the fence was not easy, so he started trying to control himself when he got angry. As the days went by, he was hammering in less nails, and within weeks he was able to control himself and was able to refrain from getting angry and from hammering nails. He came to his father and told him what he had achieved. His father was happy with his efforts and said to him: “Now, my son, you have to take out one nail for every day you do not get angry.” 
The son started to take out the nails for each day that he did not get angry, until there were no nails left in the fence. 
He came to his father and told him what he had achieved. His father took him to the fence and said, “My son, you have done well, but look at these holes in the fence. This fence will never be the same again.” Then he added: “When you say things in a state of anger, they leave marks like these holes on the hearts of others. You can stab a person and withdraw the knife but it doesn’t matter how many times you say ‘I’m sorry,’ because the wound will remain.

I have seen people raise their hands and then place them on their chests and other people who raise them and keep them to their sides.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The correct placement of the hands when standing up after 
    rukoo’ is to place the right hand on the left forearm, not to let the hands 
    hang by the sides. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: it 
    seems that the Sunnah is to place the right hand on the left forearm, 
    because of the general meaning of the hadeeth of Sahl ibn Sa’d which was 
    narrated by al-Bukhaari: “The people were commanded that a man should put 
    his right hand on his left forearm when praying.” If you look at the general 
    meaning of this hadeeth you will note that it says “when praying,” not “when 
    standing”. Thus it will be clear that when standing after rukoo’ it is 
    prescribed to put (the right hand on the left forearm), because when bowing 
    (rukoo’) the hands are placed on the knees, and when prostrating they are 
    placed on the ground, and when sitting they are placed on the thighs. But 
    when standing – which includes standing both before and after rukoo’ – a 
    person should place his right hand on his left forearm. 

    This is the correct view.

There is nothing wrong with calling your son after your husband’s father. This is a sign of the son’s respect and love for his father, especially when his name includes the names of two Prophets. 
Secondly: 
The fact that the child is called after a Prophet or a Sahaabi – let alone after your father-in-law! – does not mean that he cannot be scolded or rebuked. You have the right to call him as any mother calls her child, without having to use titles of respect. 
The fact that a child is called by a name that is beloved to Allah or by the name of one of the Prophets does not mean that he cannot be punished or rebuked when he does something wrong. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded parents and guardians to teach their children to pray when they are seven years old and to smack them if they do not pray when they are ten years old. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not make an exception for anyone whose name is Muhammad or any other name with regard to this ruling. 
It is proven in many cases that the Sahaabah and Taabi’een rebuked, scolded and smacked their children, and many of them were called Muhammad, ‘Abd-Allah and ‘Abd al-Rahman. 
Thirdly: 
It is known that the name usually has an effect on the person who carries it. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) changed bad names to good names. 
Ibn al-Qayyim said:  
Because names have meanings, these meanings will inevitably have an effect on the person who carries the name. Names have an effect on the things that are named, and the things that are named have an effect on their names, whether they are beautiful or ugly, light or heavy, subtle or crude.  
Zaad al-Ma’aad, 2/336 
Fourthly: 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baz was asked about the soundness of the hadeeth, “Whoever is called Muhammad should not be beaten or insulted.” 
He said: This hadeeth is fabricated and falsely attributed to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and it has no basis in the pure Sunnah. The same applies to the saying, “Whoever is called Muhammad under the protection of Muhammad and his name will bring him close to Paradise.” The same applies to those who say, “Whoever is called Muhammad his household will have such and such…” All of these reports have no sound basis. What matters is following Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), not being called by his name. How many of those who are called Muhammad are evil, because they do not follow Muhammad or implement his sharee’ah. Names do not purify people; what purifies them is their righteous deeds and their fear of Allah. So whoever is called Ahmad or Muhammad or Abu’l-Qaasim and is a kaafir or an evildoer will not benefit from his name. Rather what each person must do is fear Allah and strive to obey Allah and adhere to the sharee’ah of Allah with which He sent His Prophet Muhammad. This is what will benefit him, and this is the way to salvation. As for names without acting in accordance with sharee’ah, they have nothing to do with salvation or punishment.

21364,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21364,Weakness of a hadith about the virtues of Ramadan,"How sound is the hadith narrated from Salmaan al-Faarisi (may Allah be pleased with him) in which he is reported to have said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) addressed us on the last day of Sha’baan and said: ‘O People, there has come to you a great and blessed month, a month in which there is a night that is better than a thousand months. Allah has made fasting (this month) an obligation and spending its nights in prayer an act of voluntary worship. Whoever draws near to Allah during this month by doing some good deeds is like one who does an obligatory action at any other time, and the one who does an obligatory action during this month is like one who does seventy obligatory actions at any other times. It is a month whose beginning is mercy, its middle is forgiveness and its end is ransom from the Fire…’”??",,,"Praise be to Allah.This hadith was narrated by Ibn Khuzaymah in his Saheeh, 3/191, no. 1887. He said, “If the report is saheeh …” but the word ‘if’ was omitted in some references such as al-Targheeb wa’l-Tarheeb by al-Mundhiri (2/95), so they thought that Ibn Khuzaymah said, “The report is saheeh,” although he did not state that. 
It was also narrated by al-Mahaamili in al-Amaali (293); by al-Bayhaqi in Shu’ab al-Eemaan (7/216); Fadaa’il al-Awqaat, p. 146, no. 37; by Abu’l-Shaykh Ibn Hibbaan in Kitaab al-Thawaab; it was attributed to him by al-Saa’aati in al-Fath al-Rabbaani (9/233); it was mentioned by al-Suyooti in al-Durr al-Manthoor, and he said, it was narrated by al-‘Aqeeli and he classed it as da’eef (weak); it was mentioned by al-Isbahaani in al-Targheeb, and by al-Munaqqi in Kanz al-‘Ummaal (8/477). All of them narrated it via Sa’eed ibn al-Musayyib from Salmaan al-Faarisi. The isnaad of the hadith is da’eef (weak) for two reasons, which are: 
1 – There is a break in the chain of narrators, because Sa’eed ibn al-Musayyib did not hear it from Salmaan al-Faarisi (may Allah be pleased with him).
2 – Its isnaad includes ‘Ali ibn Zayd ibn Jad’aan, of whom Ibn Sa’d said: “There is some weakness in him and he cannot be quoted as evidence. He was classed as da’eef (weak) by Ahmad, Ibn Ma’een, al-Nasaa’i, Ibn Khuzaymah, al-Jawzjaani and others, as it says in Siyar A’laam al-Nubala’, 5/207. 
Abu Haatim al-Raazi judged the hadith to be munkar (a kind of weak hadith). Al-‘Ayni said likewise in ‘Umdat al-Qaari’, 9/20, as did Shaykh al-Albaani in Silsilat al-Ahaadeeth al-Da’eefah wa’l-Mawdoo’ah, vol. 2/262. no. 871. So it becomes clear that the isnaad of this hadith and similar reports are all da’eef (weak), and that the muhadditheen (scholars of hadith) judged it to be munkar, in addition to the fact that it contains some phrases whose authenticity is subject to further examination, such as its dividing the month into three parts, saying that the first ten days are mercy, then forgiveness, then ransom from the Fire. There is no evidence for this, rather the bounty of Allah is immense, all of Ramadan is mercy and forgiveness, and there are those whom Allah ransoms from the Fire every night and at the time of breaking the fast, as is proven by the ahaadeeth. 
Moreover, in this hadith it says, “Whoever draws near to Allah during this month by doing some good deeds is like one who does an obligatory action.” There is no evidence for this, rather naafil actions are naafil and obligatory actions are obligatory in Ramadan and at other times. This hadith also says, “and the one who does an obligatory action during this month is like one who does seventy obligatory actions at any other times.” This number is subject to further examination, because a good deed earns a reward between ten and seven hundred times in Ramadan and at other times, and nothing is exempted from that apart from fasting, for its reward is immense and unlimited, because of the hadith qudsi: “Every deed of the son of Adam is for him, except for fasting, which is for Me and I shall reward for it.” (Agreed upon; narrated from Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him). 
We must beware of da’eef (weak) hadith and make sure of their status before we speak of them. We must strive to find out the saheeh ahaadeeth about the virtues of Ramadan. May Allah grant us all strength and accept our fasting, night prayers and all our good deeds.

21365,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21365,"The meaning of the verse, “They will dwell therein for all the time that the heavens and the earth endure, except as your Lord wills” [Hood 11:107]","I would like an explanation of the meaning of this passage, and the most correct interpretation of it. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“As for those who are wretched, they will be in the Fire, sighing in a high and low tone.

They will dwell therein for all the time that the heavens and the earth endure, except as your Lord wills. Verily, your Lord is the Doer of whatsoever He intends (or wills).

And those who are blessed, they will be in Paradise, abiding therein for all the time that the heavens and the earth endure, except as your Lord wills: a gift without an end.”

[Hood 11:106-108] 
May it be understood from this that whoever enters Paradise may be expelled from it if Allaah wills? Have these verses been abrogated by anything in the Qur’aan, since they appear in a Makkan soorah?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    These verses have not been abrogated, rather they are clear. 
    The scholars differed as to the meaning of the phrase “except as your 
    Lord wills”, but they are agreed that the delight of the people of 
    Paradise will be everlasting and eternal; it will never cease or come to an 
    end, and they will never be expelled from it. Hence after that Allaah says, 
    “a gift without an end”, to refute what some people may imagine, that 
    some may be expelled from Paradise. For they will abide therein forever and 
    this gift is without an end, i.e., it will never cease. In other verses this 
    meaning is explained further. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Truly, the Muttaqoon (the pious) will be amidst Gardens 
    and water‑springs (Paradise).

    (It will be said to them): ‘Enter therein (Paradise), in 
    peace and security’”

    [al-Hijr 15:46]

    Allaah states that they will be secure – safe from death, 
    safe from expulsion, safe from sickness, grief and all kinds of hardship. 
    Then Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):

    “And We shall remove from their hearts any deep feeling of 
    bitterness (that they may have). (So they will be like) brothers facing each 
    other on thrones.

    No sense of fatigue shall touch them, nor shall they 
    (ever) be asked to leave it”

    [al-Hijr 15:47-48]

    So Allaah states that they will abide therein forever and 
    will never be expelled from it. 

    And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Verily, the Muttaqoon (the pious), will be in place of 
    Security (Paradise)

    Among Gardens and Springs,

    Dressed in fine silk and (also) in thick silk, facing each 
    other,

    So (it will be). And We shall marry them to Hoor (fair 
    females) with wide lovely eyes.

    They will call therein for every kind of fruit in peace 
    and security;

    They will never taste death therein except the first death 
    (of this world), and He will save them from the torment of the blazing Fire,

    As a bounty from your Lord! That will be the supreme 
    success!”

    [al-Dukhaan 44:51-57]

    So Allaah tells us that the people of Paradise will be in a 
    place of security where they will never be exposed to fear and where the 
    blessing will never be taken away from them. They will also be safe, and 
    they will not face the danger of death, sickness, expulsion, grief or any 
    other hardship, and they will never die. What this means is that the people 
    of Paradise will abide therein forever, for eternity. 

    Some of the scholars said that the phrase “except as your 
    Lord wills” refers to the extent of their stay in the grave, for the 
    believer will be in one of its gardens and delights. But that is not 
    Paradise itself, rather it is a part of Paradise, for a door will be opened 
    from Paradise for the believer in his grave, and some of its fragrance, 
    goodness and blessings will reach him. Then after that he will be 
    transferred to Paradise which is high above the heavens. 

    Some of the scholars said that what is meant by the words “except 
    as your Lord wills” is the length of their standing in the place of 
    resurrection, for the Reckoning and the reward or punishment, after they 
    have been brought forth from their graves; then after that they will go to 
    Paradise. And some of the scholars said that the meaning includes both 
    things, the time that they spend in their graves and the time that they 
    spend in the place of standing (on the Day of Judgement), and their passage 
    across the Siraat. During all of these times they are not in Paradise, but 
    they will move from these places to Paradise. 

    The phrase “except as your Lord wills” means, except 
    for the time spent in the grave, and except for the time when they stand on 
    the Day of Judgement, and except for the time spent crossing al-Siraat, 
    because at those times they will not be in Paradise, but they will be moving 
    towards it. Hence we know that the matter is clear and there is nothing 
    unclear or doubtful in it, praise be to Allaah. 

    The people of Paradise will be blessed therein and will abide 
    therein forever. There will be no death, no sickness, no expulsion, no 
    hardship, no grief, no menstruation, no nifaas (post-partum bleeding), no 
    kind of hurt forever, rather they will be in everlasting delight and 
    goodness. 

    Similarly, the people of Hell will abide in it forever; they 
    will not exit it and it will not be destroyed. Rather it will abide and they 
    will abide therein. It was said that the phrase “except as your Lord 
    wills” refers to the time they will spend in their graves, or the time 
    they will spend standing on the Day of Resurrection, as mentioned above 
    concerning the people of Paradise. After that they will be driven to Hell, 
    where they will abide for eternity. We ask Allaah to keep us safe from that. 
    Allaah says in Soorat al-Baqarah (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Thus Allaah will show them their deeds as regrets for 
    them. And they will never get out of the Fire”

    [al-Baqarah 2:167]
And Allaah says 
    concerning the kaafirs in Soorat al-Maa'idah (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 
“They will long to get 
    out of the Fire, but never will they get out therefrom; and theirs will be a 
    lasting torment”
[al-Maa’idah 5:37]

    Some of the salaf said that the Fire would come to an end 
    after thousands of years and many ages have passed, and that they would die 
    or be brought forth from it. But this view does not count for anything 
    according to the majority of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah, rather it is false 
    and is refuted by a great deal of evidence  from the Qur’aan and Sunnah, as 
    stated above. The view of Ahl al-Sunnah wa'l-Jamaa'ah is that Hell will 
    abide for eternity and that its people will never come forth from it, and 
    that it will never be destroyed, rather it will remain forever, according to 
    the apparent meaning of the Qur’aan and of the Sunnah as proven from the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). The evidence for 
    that, apart from what has been mentioned above, is that Allaah says 
    concerning the Fire (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “whenever it abates, We shall increase for them the 
    fierceness of the Fire”

    [al-Isra’ 17:97]
And Allaah says in 
    Soorat al-Naba’, addressing the people of Hell (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “So taste you (the results of your evil actions). No 
    increase shall We give you, except in torment”

    [al-Naba’ 78:30]

    We ask Allaah to keep us safe and sound from that and 
    becoming among its people. 

    See Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Maqaalaat al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 
    vol. 4, p. 361 

    Other verses which clearly indicate that the people of Hell 
    will abide therein forever include the following (interpretation of the 
    meanings): 

    1 – “Verily, those who disbelieve 
    and did wrong; Allaah will not forgive them, nor will He guide them to any 
    way — (Tafsir Al-Qurtubî).
Except the way of Hell, 
    to dwell therein forever; and this is ever easy for Allaah”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:168-169]

     2 – “(Mine is) but conveyance (of the truth) from Allaah and 
    His Messages (of Islamic Monotheism), and whosoever disobeys Allaah and His 
    Messenger, then verily, for him is the fire of Hell, he shall dwell therein 
    forever”
[al-Jinn 72:23]

     3 – “Verily, Allaah has cursed the disbelievers, and has 
    prepared for them a flaming Fire (Hell).
Wherein they will abide 
    for ever, and they will find neither a Wali (a protector) nor a helper”

          Firstly:
 
          Using medicines is prescribed in general terms. 
 
          It was narrated that Abu’l-Dardaa’ (may Allaah be pleased 
          with him) said: “The Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Allaah created the 
          disease and the remedy, so treat disease but do not treat it with things 
          which are haraam.’”
 
          (Narrated by al-Tabaraani in al-Mu’jam al-Kabeer, 
          24/254. This hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah 
          al-Saheehah, 1633). 
 
          It was narrated that Usaamah ibn Shurayk (may Allaah 
          be pleased with him) said: “The Bedouins said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, 
          shall we not use medicine?’ He said, ‘Yes, O slaves of Allaah, use medicine, 
          for Allaah does not create any disease but He also created its cure, 
          except for one disease.’ They said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, what is 
          that?’ He said, ‘Old age.’”
 
          (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2038; he said, (it is) hasan 
          saheeh. Also narrated by Abu Dawood, 3855; Ibn Maajah, 3436). 
 
          Secondly:
 
          Using medicine does not contradict the idea of putting 
          one’s trust in Allaah (tawakkul). 
 
          Ibn al-Qayyim said: 
 
          In the saheeh ahaadeeth there is the command to use medicine, 
          and that this does not contradict the idea of putting one’s trust in 
          Allaah, just as warding off hunger, thirst, heat and cold by means of 
          their opposites does not contradict it. Rather, true Tawheed cannot 
          be attained unless one takes the means which Allaah created and which 
          lead to the ends both in terms of divine decree and in terms of sharee’ah. 
          Neglecting the means undermines the essence of putting one’s trust in 
          Allaah and undermines the Divine command and wisdom, because the one 
          who neglects them thinks that this is a sign of stronger trust in Allaah. 
          But neglecting them is a sign of helplessness which contradicts putting 
          one’s trust in Allaah, the essence of which is the heart’s dependence 
          on Allaah to acquire that which will benefit a person in both his religious 
          commitment and worldly affairs, and will ward off that which will harm 
          him in both his religious commitment and worldly affairs. Alongside 
          this dependence one must also take the means, otherwise one will be 
          ignoring the wisdom and command of Allaah. We should not regard helplessness 
          as putting our trust in Allaah, or putting our trust in Allaah as helplessness.

Allah Most High says: ""He who is hostile to a friend of Mine I declare war against. My slave approaches Me with nothing more beloved to Me than what I have made obligatory upon him, and My slave keeps drawing nearer to Me with voluntary works until I love him. And when I love him, I am his hearing with which he hears, his sight with which he sees, his hand with which he seizes, and his foot with which he walks. If he asks me, I will surely give to him, and if he seeks refuge in Me, I will surely protect him"" (Fath al-Bari, 11.34041, hadith 6502); This hadith was related by Imam Bukhari, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, al-Bayhaqi, and others with multiple contiguous chains of transmission, and is sahih.
The part that I need explaining in, or rather getting confused in is, ""I am his hearing with which he hears, his sight with which he sees, his hand with which he seizes, and his foot with which he walks.""",,,"Praise be to Allah.The meaning of this part of the hadeeth is that when the believing slave strives to draw closer to Allaah by doing obligatory acts of worship, then naafil acts, Allaah will bring him closer to Him, and will raise him from the level of eemaan (faith, belief) to the level of ihsaan, so he will start to worship Allaah as if he can see Him, and his heart will be filled with knowledge of his Lord, love and awe for Him, fear of Him, and glorification and veneration of Him. When his heart is filled in this manner, any attachment to anything other than Allaah will disappear, and the person will not longer be attached to any of his whims or desires, and he will have no wish for anything except that which his Lord and Master wants. At that point the person will not speak except to remember Allaah, he will not move except to obey His command. So when he speaks, he speaks for the sake of Allaah; when he hears he hears for the sake of Allaah; when he looks, he looks for the sake of Allaah; i.e., he acts with the help and guidance of Allaah and for the sake of Allaah in these matters. So he only listens to that which Allaah loves; he only looks at that with which Allaah is pleased; he only strikes with his hands and walks with his feet for purposes with which his Lord and Master is pleased. It does not mean that Allaah is his hearing and his sight, and Allaah is his hand and his foot. Exalted be Allaah above that, for Allaah is above the Throne and He is Exalted above all His creation. Rather what is meant is that He guides him with regard to his hearing, seeing, walking and striking. Hence it was narrated in another version that Allaah says: “In Me he hears, in Me he sees, in Me he strikes and in Me he walks,” meaning that Allaah guides him in his actions, words, hearing and seeing. This is what it means according to Ahl al-Sunnah wa'l-Jamaa'ah. At the same time Allaah answers his prayers, so if he asks Him, He will give; if he seeks His help, He will help him; if he seeks refuge with Him, He will grant him refuge.
Adapted from Jaami’ al-‘Uloom wa’l-Hukam, 2/347; Fataawa Noor ‘ala’l-Darb, tape 10, by Shaykh Ibn Baaz, may Allaah have mercy on him.                                                                
Whoever suggests a meaning other than this is wrong and is transgressing the limits and showing disrespect towards Allaah, and he is going against the Arabs’ own understanding of their language and what they understand by such words. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said in Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 1/145 9: You see that Allaah has mentioned one who worships and One Who is worshipped, one who draws close and the One to Whom he draws close, one who loves and the One Who is loved, one who asks and One Who is asked, One Who gives and one to whom it is given, one who seeks refuge and One Whose refuge is sought. The hadeeth refers to two who are distinct from one another, one of whom is not the other. If that is the case, than the apparent meaning of the words “I am his hearing, his sight, his hand and his foot” cannot be that the Creator is a part or an attribute of the created being. Exalted be Allaah far above that. Rather the apparent and true meaning is that Allaah guides this slave with regard to his hearing, sight and striking, so he hears purely for the sake of Allaah, by the help of Allaah, following the commands of Allaah. The same applies to his seeing, his striking and his walking.",Islam Q&A

I asked the Shaykh, who followed in the footsteps of the earlier generations and was the example for the later generations, the most knowledgeable man I have ever met in the east or the west, Taqiy al-Deen Abu’l-‘Abbaas Ahmad ibn Taymiyah, to point out to me what is the best righteous deed after the obligatory duties. He (may Allah have mercy on him) replied as follows: 
What you have asked about, the best deed after the obligatory duties, varies from one person to another, depending on what they are able to do and what is best at any given time. So it is not possible to give a comprehensive, detailed answer that suits everyone. But what those who have knowledge of Allah and His commands are agreed upon is that constantly remembering Allah (dhikr) is the best thing with which a person may occupy himself in general. Therefore the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah narrated by Muslim says: “ ‘The mufridoon have gone ahead.’ They said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, who are the mufridoon?’ He said, ‘Those men and women who remember Allah much.’” And Abu Dawood narrated from Abu’l-Dardaa’ (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Shall I not tell you of the best of your deeds and that which is most pure in the sight of your Lord, that which raises you more in status and is better for you than giving gold and silver (in charity), and better than your meeting your enemy and striking their necks and they strike your necks?’ They said, ‘Yes, O Messenger of Allah.’ He said, ‘Remembering Allah (dhikr).’” 
There is a great deal of Qur’aanic evidence to support this. The least that a person should do is to persist in reciting the adhkaar (pl. of dhikr) which have been narrated from the teacher of good and the leader of the pious (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), such as the adhkaar to be recited at certain times, at the beginning and end of the day, when going to bed and waking up from sleep and after the prescribed prayers; and the adhkaar to be recited on certain occasions, such as that to be said when eating and drinking, when getting dressed, when having intercourse, when entering or leaving the home, the mosque or the washroom, when it rains, when thunder is heard, and so on. Books have been compiled on this topic called ‘Aml al-Yawm wa’l-Laylah (Actions of the Day and Night). One of the best books written on this topic is the small book entitled Saheeh al-Kalim al-Tayyib, which is derived from the book by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah called al-Kalim al-Tayyib; this has been edited by al-‘Allaamah al-Albaani. 
Then one should persist in remembering Allah in general, the best of which is Laa ilaaha ill-Allah. 
There may be some situations where certain kinds of dhikr are preferable, such as saying Subhaana Allah wa’l-hamdu-Lillaah wa Allahu akbar wa laa hawla wa laa quwwata illa Billaah. 
Moreover, one should realize that everything that the tongue utters or the heart imagines that may bring one closer to Allah, such as seeking knowledge or teaching, enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, is a kind of dhikr or remembering Allah. Hence the one who occupies himself in the pursuit of beneficial knowledge after performing the obligatory duties, or who joins a gathering in order to learn or teach, which Allah and His Messenger have called fiqh or understanding, is also doing something which is one of the best forms of remembering Allah (dhikr). 
If you think about it, you will not find much difference of opinion among the earliest generation concerning what is the best of deeds. Whenever a person is confused he should pray istikhaarah as prescribed in sharee’ah, for the one who prays to Allah asking Him for that which is best (istikhaarah) will not have any regrets. He should do that a lot, and make a lot of du’aa’, for that is the key to all goodness. He should not be hasty and say “I prayed but I did not get an answer.” He should seek out the times of special virtue, such as the end of the night, the times immediately following the prescribed prayers, the time of the adhaan, when rain is falling, and so on.","Quoted from the essay al-Wasiyyah al-Jaami’ah li Khayr al-Dunya wa’l-Aakhirah, by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him), published by al-Maktabah al-Salafiyyah, Cairo"
21375,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21375,Rulings on revitalizing disused land,What constitutes revitalizing disused land (al-mawaat)? What are the rulings on that?,,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          Al-Mawaat is that which has no soul. The meaning here 
          is land which has no owner. 
 
          The fuqahaa’ (may Allaah have mercy on them) defined 
          it as land which is not being used for a specific purpose and which 
          is not owned by anyone whose ownership is protected by sharee’ah. 
 
          Two things are exempted from this definition: 
 
          (1)Land which has come under 
          the protected ownership of a Muslim or a kaafir via purchase, as a gift 
          or any other means.
 
          (2)Land which serves the interests 
          of owners whose ownership of land is protected, such as roads, courtyards 
          and waterways, or lands which serve the interests of city dwellers, 
          such as graveyards, garbage dumps, places designated for Eid prayers, 
          woodlots and pastures. None of these may be acquired by revitalizing 
          the land.
 
          So if the land is not owned by a person whose ownership 
          is protected, and it is not serving a specific purpose, and someone 
          revitalizes it, then he becomes the owner of it, because of the hadeeth 
          of Jaabir which was attributed to the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Whoever revitalizes dead 
          (disused) land, it becomes his.” This was narrated by Ahmad and al-Tirmidhi, 
          who classed it as saheeh. There are other ahaadeeth which are similar 
          in meaning, some of which are narrated in  Saheeh al-Bukhaari. 
 Most 
          of the fuqahaa’ of different regions agreed that possession of disused 
          land may be taken by revitalizing it, although they differed as to the 
          conditions attached to that, except for the disused lands of the Haram 
          (sanctuary of Makkah) and of ‘Arafaat, which cannot be taken possession 
          of by revitalizing them, because that would make it too difficult to 
          perform the rituals and because he would be taking land which may have 
          to be used during the Hajj. 
 
          Revitalizing disused land may take several forms: 
 
          (1)If a person encloses it 
          with a solid wall to keep others out, of the kind that is usually used 
          for that purpose, then he has revitalized it, because the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever encloses 
          land with a wall, it becomes his.” This was narrated by Ahmad and Abu 
          Dawood from Jaabir, and classed as saheeh by al-Jaarood; a similar report 
          was narrated from Samurah. This indicates that enclosing the land is 
          one of the things by which a person earns the right to ownership. What 
          should be borne in mind is what the word haa’it (wall) refers to in 
          linguistic terms; if a person merely places stones, piles of dirt or 
          a small wall around the land which does not keep anyone out, or he digs 
          a ditch around it, then he does not take possession of it, but he will 
          have more right to revitalize it than anyone else, and he is not permitted 
          to sell it unless he revitalizes it.
 
          (2) If he digs a well 
          on the disused land and reaches water, then he has revitalized it. If 
          he digs a well but does not reach water, then he does not take possession 
          of the land thereby, but he will have more right to it than others, 
          because he has started to revitalize it.
 
          (3)If he brings water to the 
          disused land from a spring or river, then he has revitalized it thereby, 
          because the water is of more benefit to the land than a wall.
 
          (4)If he drains water from 
          disused land which was covered with water, because of which the land 
          was not suitable for farming, and he drains the water so the land then 
          becomes fit for that use, then he has revitalized it, because this is 
          of more benefit to the land than the wall by building which, according 
          to the report, one takes possession of the land.
 
          Some of the scholars think that revitalizing disused 
          land should not stop there; rather the matter should be referred to 
          ‘urf (custom) and what the people count as revitalizing land, because 
          through this revitalizing process he will become the owner of the land. 
          This was the view of a group of Hanbali imams and others, because sharee’ah 
          made revitalizing the land the condition for taking possession of it, 
          but it did not define precisely what was meant by revitalizing. So we 
          should refer to what is regarded as revitalizing land according to custom. 
           
 
          The Muslim ruler has the right to give land to one who 
          will revitalize it, because the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) gave land to Bilaal ibn 
          al-Haarith al-‘Aqeeq, he gave land in Hadramawt to Waa’il ibn Hajr; 
          and he gave land to ‘Umar, ‘Uthmaan and a number of the Sahaabah. But 
          the recipient does not become the owner of the land just because he 
          has been given it, unless he revitalizes it, but he has more right to 
          it than others, so if he revitalizes it, it becomes his, and if he is 
          unable to revitalize it, the ruler can take it back and give it to someone 
          else who is able to revitalize it. ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah 
          be pleased with him) took back land from those who were unable to revitalize 
          it. 
 
          Whoever reaches a permissible thing first – apart from 
          disused land – such as game [animals or birds for hunting] or wood, 
          then he has more right to it. 
 
          If water that is permissible for everybody (i.e., water 
          that is not owned by anybody) passes through people’s lands, such as 
          a river or the water of a wadi, then the owner of the higher land has 
          the right to use the water for irrigation and to withhold it until it 
          reaches the ankles, then he should let it flow to people further on, 
          and so on in turn. The Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Irrigate (your land), 
          O Zubayr, then withhold the water until it reaches the walls between 
          the pits round the trees” (agreed upon). ‘Abd al-Razzaaq quoted Mu’ammar 
          al-Zuhri as saying, “We looked at the words of the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), ‘then withhold the water 
          until it reaches the walls between the pits round the trees,’ and it 
          came up to the ankles.” In other words, they worked it out from the 
          story and found that it came up to the ankles, so they made that the 
          standard for deciding how much the first one should take, then the next 
          one, and so on. Abu Dawood and others narrated from ‘Amr ibn Shu’ayb 
          that the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) ruled concerning the waterway 
          of Mazoor (a well known wadi in Madeenah) that the (owner of the) higher 
          (land) should withhold the water until it reached the ankles, then the 
          (owner of the) higher (land) should let it flow to the lower (land). 
 
          But if the water is owned, it should be divided among 
          the owners based on the size of their land, and each of them may dispose 
          of his share as he wishes. 
 
          The leader of the Muslims has the right to protect the 
          grazing lands of the flocks belonging to the Bayt al-Maal (treasury) 
          of the Muslims, such as horses used for jihad and camels given in charity, 
          so long as that will not harm the people by making things difficult 
          for them. Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) narrated that the 
          Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) protected (the land of) 
          al-Naqee’ for the horses of the Muslims. It is permissible for the ruler 
          to protect the grass of disused lands for the camels given in charity, 
          the horses of the mujaahideen, the cattle given as jizyah (tax paid 
          by non-Muslim subjects of the Islamic state) and lost animals, if there 
          is a need for that and if that will not cause hardship to the Muslims.",From al-Mulakhkhas al-Fiqhi by Shaykh Salih ibn Fawzan Aal Fawzan

How to call iqamah","Praise be to Allah.Versions of the adhan
Several versions of the adhan have been narrated in sound reports from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). It is Sunnah to use all the versions that have been narrated from him in order to revive the Sunnah and to put an end to disputes and differences that may be raised by those who have no knowledge or who are fanatical about their own madhhabs. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said: 
“Everything that has been narrated in the Sunnah about the adhan is permissible. Rather what should be done is to recite one version sometimes and another version sometimes, so long as that will not cause confusion and fitnah (tribulation). 
Adhan according to Imam Malik and Imam Al-Shafi`i
Imam Malik narrated seventeen phrases to be recited, starting with Allahu akbar, to be said twice; then the muadhdhin should recite the Shahadatayn to himself first, then say them out loud and continue with the adhan . 
According to Imam al-Shafi`i, there are nineteen phrases with the takbir at the beginning four times; then the muadhdhin should recite the Shahadatayn to himself first, then say them out loud and continue with the adhan. 
All of this was narrated in the Sunnah, so if you give the call to prayer one way sometimes and in the other way sometimes, this is better. The basic principle is that in the case of acts of worship which were narrated in different ways, it is preferable to do them in all of those ways.” (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 2/51- 52) 
Adhan according to Imam Ahmad and Imam Abu Hanifah
The madhhab of Imam Ahmad and Imam Abu Hanifah is that the adhan consists of fifteen phrases; this is the adhan of Bilal (may Allah be pleased with him). 
The evidence for the view of Malik and al-Shafi`i
It was narrated from Abu Mahdhurah that the Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught him this adhan:
“Allahu akbar, Allah akbar, ash-hadu an la ilaha ill-Allah, ash-hadu an la ilaha ill-Allah, ash-hadu anna Muhammadan rasul-Allah, ash-hadu anna Muhammadan rasul-Allah. Then he should repeat, ash-hadu an la ilaha ill-Allah, ash-hadu an la ilaha ill-Allah, ash-hadu anna Muhammadan rasul-Allah, ash-hadu anna Muhammadan rasul-Allah. Hayya ‘ala al-salaah – twice; hayya ‘ala’l-falah – twice; Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar, La ilaha ill-Allah.” (Narrated by Muslim, 379). 
This hadith is the evidence quoted for the view of Malik and al-Shafi`i, because it describes two ways of reciting the takbir at the beginning of the adhan – twice according to the view of Malik and four times according to the view of al-Shafi`i. 
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“This hadith in Sahih Muslim also mentions saying Allahu akbar only two times at the beginning. Elsewhere then in Muslim it says that Allah akbar should be said four times. Al-Qadi ‘Iyad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: in some reports in Sahih Muslim it mentions saying it four times. Al-Shafi`’i, Abu Hanifah, Ahmad and the majority of scholars said that it is to be repeated four times, and Malik said that it is to be repeated twice, and he quoted this hadith as evidence. 
The evidence for the view of Abu Hanifah and Ahmad
It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn Zayd said: When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ordered that a bell should be made so that it could be struck to call the people to prayer, a man walked around me whilst I was sleeping [i.e., in a dream], carrying a bell in his hand. I said, “O slave of Allah, will you sell this bell?” He asked, “What will you do with it?” I said, “We will call the people to prayer.” He said, “Shall I not tell you of something better than that?” I said, “Yes.” He said, “Say: Allahu akbar, Allah akbar, Allahu akbar, Allah akbar; ash-hadu an la ilaha ill-Allah, ash-hadu an la ilaha ill-Allah; ash-hadu anna Muhammadan rasul-Allah, ash-hadu anna Muhammadan rasul-Allah; hayya ‘ala al-salah, hayya ‘ala al-salah; hayya ‘ala’l-falah, hayya ‘ala’l-falah; Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar; La ilaha ill-Allah
(Allah is most Great, Allah is most Great, Allah is most Great, Allah is most Great. I bear witness that there is no god except Allah, I bear witness that there is no god except Allah. I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. Come to prayer, come to prayer; come to success, come to success. Allah is most Great, Allah is most Great, there is no god except Allah).” Then he went a short distance away from me and said: “And when the prayer is about to begin (iqamah), say:
Allahu akbar, Allah akbar; ash-hadu an la ilah ill-Allah; ash-hadu anna Muhammadan rasul-Allah; hayya ‘ala al-salah, hayya ‘ala’l-falah; qad qamat il-salah, qad qamat il-salah (prayer is about to begin); Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar; La ilaha ill-Allah
The following morning, I went to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and told him what I had seen. He said, “This is a true dream, in sha Allah. Get up with Bilal and teach him what you saw, for he has a more melodious voice than you.” So I got up with Bilal and taught him, and he gave the call to prayer. ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab heard that in his house and he came out, dragging his lower garment and saying, “By the One Who sent you with the truth, O Messenger of Allah, I saw the same as he saw!” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “To Allah be praise.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 499; classed as sahih by Ibn Khuzaymah, 1/191 and Ibn Hibban, 4/572. al-Tirmidhi narrated that Imam al-Bukhari deemed it sahih, as it says in Sunan al-Bayhaqi, 1/390) 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: 
“As this is the case, the correct view is the view of Ahl al-Hadith and those who agree with them, which is to accept everything that has been narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and not to disapprove of any of these narrations, because the variations in the adhan and iqamah are like the variations in the recitation and tashahhud etc.… No one has the right to disapprove of anything that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has prescribed for his ummah. 
With regard to those who dispute and are divided on such issues, to the extent that they regard people as friends or enemies, or fight over such issues in which variation is approved of by Allah, as some of the people in the east do, they are among those who split up their religion (i.e. who left the true Islamic Monotheism), and became sects, [i.e. they invented new things in the religion (Bid‘ah), and followed their vain desires]  [cf. al-Rum 30:32]. 
In order to follow the Sunnah completely we should do it one way one time and the other way another time, this way in one place and the other way in another place, because forsaking what was narrated in the Sunnah and adhering to something else may lead to regarding what is Sunnah as bid’ah and regarding something that is mustahabb as obligatory, and that would lead to division and disputes if others do it the other way. 
So the Muslim should pay attention to the general principles which call for adherence to the Sunnah and the jama’ah (main body of Muslims), especially with regard to prayers in congregation.  
Saying the Shahadatayn twice in a low voice and then repeating that out loud in the adhan was the option favoured by Malik and al-Shafi`’i, but Malik thought that the takbeer should be said twice and al-Shafi`’i thought that it should be said four times, whereas Abu Hanifah thought that the Shahadatayn should not be said in a low voice during the adhan. With regard to Ahmad, he said that both ways were Sunnah but he preferred not to do it, because that was the adhan of Bilal. 
How to call iqamah
With regard to the iqamah , Malik, al-Shafi`’i and Ahmad said that the phrases should be said once, but Ahmad said that saying them twice is Sunnah. All three of them, Abu Hanifah, al-Shafi`’i and Ahmad, preferred to say Qad qamat il-salah twice, whereas Malik did not. And Allah knows best. (Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 22/66-69)

21379,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21379,Who was al-Hallaaj?,Who was Mansoor Hallaj . What is his role in Islamic History?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Al-Hallaaj was al-Husayn ibn Mansoor al-Hallaaj, who was known as Abu Mugheeth, or Abu ‘Abd-Allaah. He grew up in Waasit, or it was said in Tastar, and he was connected with a group of Sufis including Sahl al-Tastari, al-Junayd, Abu’l-Hasan al-Noori and others. 
He traveled to many places, including Makkah and Khurasaan, and India where he learned sihr (magic, witchcraft). He finally settled in Baghdaad, where he was killed. 
He learned magic in India, and he was a trickster and cheat. He deceived many ignorant people thereby, and they were attracted by him, until they thought that he was one of the greatest awliya’ (close friends or “saints”) of Allaah. 
He is liked by most of the Orientalists, and they think that he was killed wrongfully because, as we shall see below, his beliefs were close to Christian beliefs and he preached a similar message. 
He was executed in Baghdad in 309 AH, because it was proven by his own confession and otherwise that he was a kaafir and a heretic. 
The scholars of his time were agreed that he was to be executed because of the words of kufr and heresy that were narrated from him. 
The following are some of the things that he said: 
1-He claimed to be a prophet, then he went further and said that he was God. He used to say, “I am Allaah,” and he commanded his daughter-in-law to prostrate to him. She said, “Should I prostrate to someone other than Allaah?” He said, “There is a god in the heavens and a god on earth.”
2-He believed in incarnation and union with the Divine, i.e., that Allaah was incarnated in him, and that he and Allaah had become one and the same – exalted be Allaah far above that.
This is what made him acceptable to the Christian Orientalists, because he shared their belief in incarnation, for they believe that God was incarnated in Jesus (‘Eesa, peace be upon him). Hence al-Hallaaj spoke of divine nature and human nature as the Christians do. 
Some of the lines of verse that he composed said: 
“Glory be to the one Whose human form manifested the secret of His divinity
Then He emerged among His creation in the form of one who eats and drinks.” 
When Ibn Haneef heard these lines, he said, “May the curse of Allaah be upon the one who said this.” It was said to him, “This is the poetry of al-Hallaaj.” He said, “If this is what he believes, then he is a kaafir.” 
3-He heard someone reciting a verse from the Qur’aan, and he said, “I am able to compose something like that.”
4-Another of his lines of poetry says:
“People formed different beliefs about God, and I believe in everything that they believed.” 
These words imply that he approved of and believed in all forms of kufr that the misguided sects of humanity believe in, but it is a contradictory notion that no sound mind can accept. How can anyone believe in Tawheed and shirk at the same time? 
5-He said things which denied the pillars and basic principles of Islam, namely prayer, zakaah, fasting and Hajj.
6-He used to say that the souls of the Prophets had been reincarnated in the bodies of his companions and students. So he would say to one of them, “You are Nooh”; and to another, “You are Moosa”; and to another, “You are Muhammad.”
7-When he was taken out to be executed, he said to his companions, “Do not worry about this, for I will return to you after thirty days,” He was executed and he never came back.
Because of these sayings and others, the scholars were agreed that he was a kaafir and a heretic, and for this reason he was executed in Baghdad in 309 AH. Similarly, most of the Sufis denounced him and denied that he was one of them. Among those who denounced him was al-Junayd, and he was not mentioned by Abu’l-Qaasim al-Qushayri in his book in which he mentioned many of the Sufi shaykhs. 
The one who strove to have him executed and who held a council in which he ruled that he deserved to be executed was al-Qaadi Abu ‘Umar Muhammad ibn Yoosuf al-Maaliki (may Allaah have mercy on him). Ibn Katheer praised him for that and said, “One of his greatest and most correct judgements was his ruling that al-Husayn ibn Mansoor al-Hallaaj was to be executed.” (al-Bidaayah wa’l-Nihaayah, 11/172) 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “Whoever believes what al-Hallaaj believed in and agrees with the ideas for which al-Hallaaj was executed, is a kaafir and an apostate, according to the consensus of the Muslims. For the Muslims executed him because of his belief in incarnation, union with the Divine and other heretical beliefs, such as his saying, ‘I am Allaah,’ and, ‘There is a god in the heavens and a god on earth.’ … Al-Hallaaj performed extraordinary feats and various kinds of magic, and there are books of magic which are attributed to him. In conclusion, there is no dispute among the ummah that whoever believes that Allaah can be incarnated in a human being and be as one with him, or that a human being can be a god, is a kaafir whose blood it is permissible to shed. On this basis al-Hallaaj was executed.”
(Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 2/480)

Evidence for the prohibition of marrying a non-Muslim man","Praise be to Allah.Can a Muslim man marry a Christian or Jewish woman?
It is permissible for a Muslim man to marry a non-Muslim woman if she is Christian or Jewish, but it is not permissible for him to marry a non-Muslim woman who follows any religion other than these two. 
Evidence for the permissibility of marrying a Christian or Jewish woman
The evidence for that is the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Made lawful to you this day are At-Tayyibat [all kinds of Halal (lawful) foods, which Allah has made lawful (meat of slaughtered eatable animals, milk products, fats, vegetables and fruits)]. The food (slaughtered cattle, eatable animals) of the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) is lawful to you and yours is lawful to them. (Lawful to you in marriage) are chaste women from the believers and chaste women from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before your time when you have given their due Mahr (bridal-money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage), desiring chastity (i.e. taking them in legal wedlock) not committing illegal sexual intercourse, nor taking them as girlfriends.” [al-Maidah 5:5] 
Imam al-Tabari said in his commentary on this verse: 
“Chaste women from the believers and chaste women from those who were given the Scripture” means, free woman among those whom have been given the Scripture, namely the Jews and Christians who believe in what is in the Tawrat (Torah) and Injil (Gospel) from among the people who came before you, O believers in Muhammad, whether from among the Arabs or other people; you are permitted to marry them “when you have given their due Mahr (bridal-money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage)” which means, if you give to those whom you marry of your (Muslims’) chaste women and their (Jews’ and Christians’) chaste women their mahrs or dowries.” (Tafsir al-Qurtubi, 6/104) 
Can a Muslim man marry a non-Muslim woman?
But it is not permissible for a Muslim man to marry a Magian (Zoroastrian) woman or a communist woman or an idol-worshipping woman, etc. 
The evidence for that is the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And do not marry Al-Mushrikat (idolatresses) till they believe (worship Allah Alone). And indeed a slave woman who believes is better than a (free) Mushrikah (idolatress), even though she pleases you” [al-Baqarah 2:221] 
A mushrikah is an idol-worshipping woman who worships stones, whether from among the Arabs or others. 
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
It is not permissible for a Muslim woman to marry a non-Muslim man from any other religion, whether from among the Jews or Christians, or any other kafir religion. It is not permissible for her to marry a Jew, a Christian , a Magian, a communist, an idol-worshipper, etc. 
Evidence for the prohibition of marrying a non-Muslim man
The evidence for that is the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And give not (your daughters) in marriage to Al-Mushrikun till they believe (in Allah Alone) and verily, a believing slave is better than a (free) Mushrik (idolater), even though he pleases you. Those (Al-Mushrikun) invite you to the Fire, but Allah invites (you) to Paradise and forgiveness by His Leave, and makes His Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) clear to mankind that they may remember.” [al-Baqarah 2:221] 
Imam al-Tabari said: 
“What is said concerning the interpretation of the words “And give not (your daughters) in marriage to Al-Mushrikun till they believe (in Allah Alone) and verily, a believing slave is better than a (free) Mushrik (idolater), even though he pleases you” is that what Allah meant by that is that Allah has forbidden the believing women from marrying a mushrik, no matter what kind of shirk he believes in. So, O believers, do not give your daughters in marriage to them, for that is forbidden to you. For you to give them in marriage to a believing slave who believes in Allah and His Messenger and that which he brought from Allah is better for you than to give them in marriage to a free mushrik even if he is of noble descent and honourable origins, even if you like his descent and background…
 It was narrated that Qatadah and al-Zuhri said, concerning the phrase “And give not (your daughters) in marriage to Al-Mushrikun”, It is not permissible for you to give them in marriage to a Jew or a Christian or a mushrik who is not a follower of your religion.” (Tafsir al-Qurtubi, 2/379)

21381,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21381,Is Corneas Donation Allowed in Islam?,Can Muslims donate corneas after death?,"It is permissible to remove the corneas from a person after his death has been confirmed, and to implant them in the eye of a Muslim person who needs them, if it is thought most likely that the operation will be successful, and so long as the next of kin (of the deceased) do not object.",,"Praise be to Allah.The Council of Senior Scholars has issued the following statement: 

Firstly: It is permissible to remove the corneas from a person after his death has been confirmed, and to implant them in the eye of a Muslim person who needs them, if it is thought most likely that the operation will be successful, and so long as the next of kin (of the deceased) do not object. 

This is based on the principle of serving the greater of two interests and doing the lesser of two harms, and of giving precedence to the interests of the living over the interests of the dead. There is the hope that the living will be able to see again after having lost his sight, and that this will benefit him and he will benefit the Ummah in turn. 
The deceased person from whom the cornea is taken does not lose anything, because his eyes will turn to dust anyways. Removing the cornea from his eyes is not a visible mutilation of his body, because his eyes will be closed. 

Secondly: It is also permissible to remove a sound cornea from a sound eyeball that has been removed from a person to protect him against some danger that may result from leaving it in place, and to transplant it into the eye of another Muslim who needs it, if removing it is in the interests of the health of the original owner and transplanting it to another person will not cause him any harm and will benefit the other person. All of that is permitted in Shari`ah.

21383,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21383,Ruqyah (Incantation) or D’awah (Propagation),"We need to make d’awah (propagation), but one of us is focusing on treating those who are affected by the jinn.

Is it permissible to neglect d’awah in order to do this deed? How should those who are affected by evil whispers from the jinn be treated? Is it permissible to accept payment for this reading?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) 
    was asked this question and he said: 

    Calling people to Allah (d’awah) is a communal obligation 
    (fard kifayah); if sufficient people undertake to do it, the rest are then 
    absolved of the obligation. If a person finds that he has to do it and no 
    one else can take his place, then it takes priority over reading Quran over 
    one who is affected by the jinn. That is because the results of d’awah are 
    certain whereas the results of reading Quran over one who is affected by the 
    jinn may not be certain. How many people have had Quran recited over them 
    and have not benefited. 

    So if this man realizes that he has to do d’awah and no one 
    else can take his place, then he must do d’awah even if it means he does not 
    recite Quran over one who is affected by the jinn. 

    But if it is the matter of fard kifayah, then you should look 
    and decide what is in people’s best interests. If it is possible to combine 
    the two – which seems to be the case – by devoting a day for one and a day 
    for the other whilst continuing to engage in d’awah, that is better, so that 
    he may benefit his Muslim brothers who are suffering from this affliction 
    and so that the work of calling people to Allah may continue at the same 
    time. 

    With regard to the correct treatment of those who are 
    affected by the jinn, this varies from one case to another, but the best is 
    to recite Quran over the person, such as the words (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “O assembly of jinn and men! If you have power to pass beyond 
    the zones of the heavens and the earth, then pass beyond (them)! But you 
    will never be able to pass them, except with authority (from Allah)!

    Then which of the Blessings of your Lord will you both (jinn 
    and men) deny?

    There will be sent against you both, smokeless flames of fire 
    and (molten) brass, and you will not be able to defend yourselves.

    Then which of the Blessings of your Lord will you both (jinn 
    and men) deny?”
    [55:33-36] 

    Because this reminds them [the jinn] that they cannot flee 
    from Allah. You should also recite al-Mu’awwadhatayn [the last two Surahs of 
    the Quran] and Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad [112] and ayat al-Kursiy [2:255]. You 
    may also preach to them as Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah used to do, telling 
    them, “It is haram for you to harm the Muslims or to beat them,” etc. 

    With regard to accepting payment for this: if he does not 
    take money it is better, but if he takes it without stipulating payment 
    beforehand that is acceptable. If those for whom he is reading do not carry 
    out their duties towards the reader and he insists that he will only read 
    for them if he is given something in return, there is nothing wrong with 
    that, as this is what the people of the raiding party sent out by the 
    Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did. It was narrated that 
    Abu Sa’eed (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “A group of the companions 
    of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) set out on a 
    journey and traveled until they stopped in (the land of) one of the Arab 
    tribes. They asked them for hospitality but they refused to welcome them. 
    The chief of this tribe was stung by a scorpion and they tried everything 
    but nothing helped them. Some of them said, ‘Why don’t you go to those 
    people who are camped (near us), maybe you will find something with them.’ 
    So they went to them and said, ‘O people, our chief has been stung by a 
    scorpion and we have tried everything but nothing helped him. Can any of you 
    do anything?’ One of them said, ‘Yes, by Allah, I will recite ruqyah 
    (incantation) for him, but by Allah we asked you for hospitality and you did 
    not welcome us, so I will not recite ruqyah for you until you give us 
    something in return.’ Then they agreed upon a flock of sheep. Then he went 
    and spat drily and recited over him Al-hamdu Lillahi Rabb il-‘alameen [Surat 
    al-Fatihah]. (The chief) got up as if he was released from a chain and 
    started walking, and there were no signs of sickness on him. They paid them 
    what they agreed to pay. Some of them (i.e. the companions) then suggested 
    to divide their earnings among themselves, but the one who performed the 
    ruqyah said, ‘Do not divide them until we go to the Prophet (peace and 
    blessings of Allah be upon him) and tell him what happened, then wait and 
    see what he tells us to do.’ So they went to the Messenger of Allah (peace 
    and blessings of Allah be upon him) and told him what had happened. The 
    Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked, ‘How 
    did you know that it (al-Fatihah) is a ruqyah?’ Then he added, ‘You have 
    done the right thing. Share out (the flock of sheep) and give me a share 
    too.’ And the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) 
    smiled.”  (al-Bukhari, Muslim).","See Liqa’ al-Baab al-Maftooh, 44"

It is permissible to give regular charity – not obligatory charity (i.e., Zakah) to poor non-Muslims , and to exchange gifts and with them and treat them well to soften their hearts towards Islam, so long as they have not carried out any hostile actions against the Muslims, which would disallow that.

21390,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21390,Dealing With a Child’s Fears,"I have a child who is afraid of everything, even his own shadow, and I do not know whether the way I am bringing him up is wrong, or how I can teach him to be brave.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Specialists in child psychology think that in his first year a child may show signs of fear when hearing a sudden noise, or if something falls suddenly, and so on.  A child may be afraid of strangers starting from the age of approximately six months, and in the second year a child may be afraid of many things such as animals, cars, slopes, water, etc. 
In general, females show more fear than males, and the intensity of the fear may vary according to the intensity of the child’s imagination; the more imaginative a child is, the more fearful he may be. 
Several factors and reasons may increase a child’s fears, such as: 
-The mother scaring her child with ideas of ghosts and ghouls, or soldiers, or shadows, or ‘ifreets (jinn) or strange creatures, etc.
-Too much coddling on the part of the parents, or their being too anxious and sensitive about him.
-Raising the child in isolation, keeping him within the four walls of the house.
-Telling fairy stories that have to do with jinns and ‘ifreets…
… and other reasons. 
A child may be made susceptible to fear by picking up the fears of his parents through what he sees. Fears acquired in this manner are characterized by their lengthy duration. Hence, setting a good example plays a major role in training a child not to be afraid. What is required here is an example of bravery in all kinds of different situations, and not being afraid of animals that are not harmful or of people in high positions when demanding one’s rights, and generally not being afraid for no reason. 
In order to deal with a child’s fears, the parents must pay attention to a number of matters, including: 
-Bringing him up from the earliest age to believe in Allah and worship Him, and to turn to Him in all situations of anxiety and fear.
-Giving the child some freedom and responsibilities, and letting him do things, according to his stage of development.
-Not scaring him, especially when he cries, with ideas of ghosts, hyenas, thieves, jinn and ‘ifreets, etc.  This comes under the heading of “better”, as in the hadeeth: “The strong believer is better and is more loved by Allah than the weak believer.” (Narrated by Muslim, no. 2664).
-Encouraging him from an early age to mix with others and giving him the opportunity to meet them and get to know them, so that he will feel from the depth of his heart that he is loved and respected by everyone whom he meets and gets to know.
What the psychologists and educationalists advise is giving the child the opportunity to get to know the thing that is frightening him, so that if he is afraid of the dark, there is nothing wrong with letting him play with the light-switch, turning it off and on; if he is afraid of water there is nothing wrong with letting him play with a little water in a small bowl, and so on… 
-Parents can also tell him stories of the heroic salaf (early generations of Islam), and train him to adopt the attitudes of the Sahaabah, so that he will develop a brave and heroic nature.
But if the child’s fear is a form anxiety, then its cause may be a number of interconnected factors which according to the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), should be dealt with in a wise and careful manner. These factors include: 
-Giving the child more to do than he is able, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “He who does not show mercy to our young ones and acknowledge the rights of our old ones is not one of us.” (Narrated by Abu Dawood, no. 4943; al-Tirmidhi, 1921; also narrated in Saheeh al-Jaami’ by al-Albaani, 5444).
-Not satisfying his need for success. It was narrated that ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I never heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saying ‘May my father and mother be sacrificed for you’ to anyone, except Sa’d, to whom I heard him say, ‘Shoot, may my father and mother be sacrificed for you!’ And I think that was on the day of Uhud.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, no. 6184; Muslim, no. 2411). This shows that parents should encourage their children no matter what the level of quality of their performance, so that they will be motivated to do even better.
-Going to extremes in physical punishment and dealing harshly with them. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever is deprived of gentleness is deprived of all goodness.” (Narrated by Muslim, no. 2292).
-Difficult living conditions which lead the parents to vent their anger on their children – such as a lack of harmony between the spouses, or the mother’s work, or not being happy at work. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The strong man is not the one who can wrestle another to the ground, rather the strong man is the one who can control himself at times of anger.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, no. 6116).
Finally, we must point out that this does not mean that the child should never be afraid. Fear is necessary in some cases, because it is essential to the child’s survival. He must fear Allah, and fear the harm that people may do, and fear committing sin, etc. That should be a natural kind of fear, not too great or too small.","From Tanshiy’at al-Fataat al-Muslimah, p. 159, by Hanaan ‘Atiyah al-Toori al-Juhani"

Plucking of women’s eyebrows is not permissible, it is the namas for which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed the one who does it. The naamisah is the one who does it for someone else and the mutanammisah is the one who asks someone else to do it for her (as mentioned in the hadeeth). The same applies if a woman does it for herself. It is haraam and is not permitted.
Allah is Wise in what He decrees for His slaves. Some people are beautiful in appearance and some are not; the entire matter is in the hand of Allah. It is essential to be patient and seek reward with Allah, and not to transgress His sacred limits for the sake of one's own whims and desires.
What I think is that you should not remove anything from the eyebrows at all, unless there is hair outside of the line of the eyebrows, such as if there is a mole from which a hair is growing. This may be removed because in this case it is removing a kind of fault or deformity, not in order to look beautiful. And Allah knows best.
See Fataawa Manaar al-Islam by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him), vol. 3, p. 832.

The graves should be dug up and the remains transferred to the public graveyards, with each set of remains placed in an individual grave as with all other graves. It is not permissible for graves to be left in mosques, whether that is the grave of a wali (“saint”) or of anyone else, because the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade that and warned against that, and he cursed the Jews and Christians for doing that. It was narrated that he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “May Allah curse the Jews and the Christians, for they took the graves of their Prophets as places of worship.” ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said, “He was warning against what they had done.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1330, Muslim, 529. 
And when Umm Salamah and Umm Habeebah told him about a church in which there were images, he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When a righteous man died among them, they would build a place of worship over his grave and put those images in it. They are the most evil of mankind before Allaah.” (Saheeh, agreed upon. Al-Bukhaari, 427; Muslim, 528) 
And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Those who came before you took the graves of their Prophets and righteous people as places of worship. Do not take graves as places of worship – I forbid you to do that.” (Narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh, 532, from Jundab ibn ‘Abd-Allaah al-Bajali).  So the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade taking graves as places of worship and he cursed those who do that, stating that they are the most evil of mankind. So we must beware of that. 
It is known that everyone who prays at a grave is taking it as a place of worship, and whoever builds a mosque over a grave has taken it as a place of worship. So we must keep graves far away from the mosques and not put graves inside mosques, in obedience to the command of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and so as to avoid the curse issued by our Lord against those who build places of worship over graves, because when a person prays in a mosque in which there is a grave, the Shaytaan may tempt him to call upon the deceased or to seek his help, or to pray to him or prostrate to him, thus committing major shirk; and because this is the action of the Jews and Christians and we are obliged to differ from them and to keep away from their ways and their evil actions. But if the graves are ancient and a mosque was built over them, then it should be knocked down, because this is an innovated thing, as was stated by the scholars, and so as to avoid the means that may lead to shirk.
