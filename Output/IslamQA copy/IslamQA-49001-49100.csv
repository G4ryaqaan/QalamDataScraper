Is it possible to observe i’tikaf for a short time or does it have to be for several days?,The majority of scholars are of the view that the minimum time of i’tikaf is a moment while some other scholars view that the minimum time of i’tikaf is one day.,,"Praise be to Allah.The scholars differed as to the minimum length of time for i’tikaf . 
The majority of scholars are of the view that the minimum length of time is a moment. This is the view of Abu Hanifah and Ahmad. See al-Durr al-Mukhtar (1/445); al-Majmu’, 6/489; al-Insaf, 7/566. 
Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmu’, 6/514: 
“With regard to the minimum length of time for i’tikaf , the majority stipulated that it must be observed in the mosque, and that it is permissible to do a lot or a little, even an hour or a moment.” 
They quoted several reports as evidence for that: 
1 – That i’tikaf in Arabic means staying, and the word may be applied to a long period of time or a short one; there is no report in shari’ah that defines it as being a specific length of time. 
Ibn Hazm said: 
“I’tikaf in the language of the Arabs means staying… any stay in the mosque for the sake of Allah with the intention of drawing closer to Him is i'tikaf… whether that is for a short time or a long time, because the Quran and Sunnah do not specify any number or length of time.” Al-Muhalla, 5/179 
2 – Ibn Abi Shaybah narrated that Ya’la ibn Umayyah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I will stay in the mosque for an hour, and I am only staying to observe i’tikaf. Ibn Hazm quoted this as evidence in al-Muhalla (5/179); it was quoted without comment by al-Hafiz in al-Fath. “Hour” here refers to a period of time but it does not mean an hour in the modern sense of sixty minutes. 
Some scholars are of the opinion that the minimum length of i'tikaf is one day. This was narrated from Abu Hanifah and was the view of some of the Malikis. 
Shaykh Ibn Baz said in Majmu’ al-Fatawa (15/441): 
“I’tikaf means staying in the mosque to worship Allah, whether that is for a long time or a short time, because as far as I know there is no report to indicate a set time, whether one or two days or more. This is an act of worship which is prescribed in Islam unless one vows to do it, in which case it becomes obligatory. This applies equally to men and women.”

Weak hadiths on the virtues of i’tikaf","Praise be to Allah.Virtues of i’tikaf
I’tikaf is prescribed in Islam and it is an act of worship that draws one closer to Allah. 
Once this is established, there are many ahadith which encourage us to draw closer to Allah by doing nafl acts of worship . The general meaning of these ahadith includes all kinds of worship, including i’tikaf . 
For example, there is the hadith qudsi in which Allah says: “My servant draws not near to Me with anything more loved by Me than the religious duties I have enjoined upon him, and My servant continues to draw near to Me with supererogatory works so that I shall love him. When I love him I am his hearing with which he hears, his seeing with which he sees, his hand with which he strikes and his foot with which he walks. Were he to ask [something] of Me, I would surely give it to him, and were he to ask Me for refuge, I would surely grant him it.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 6502) 
Weak hadiths on the virtues of i’tikaf
There are several ahadith which speak of the virtue of i'tikaf and describe its reward, but they are all weak (da’if) or fabricated (mawdu’). 
Abu Dawud said: I said to Ahmad (i.e., Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal): Do you know anything about the virtue of i’tikaf? He said: No, except something weak. Masail Abi Dawud, p. 96. 
These ahadith include the following: 

Ibn Majah (1781) narrated from Ibn 'Abbas that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said concerning the person who observes i’tikaf: “He is refraining from sin and he will be given a reward like that of one who does all kinds of good deeds.”  This was classed as da’if by al-Albani in Da’if Ibn Majah. 
Al-Tabarani, al-Hakim and al-Bayhaqi narrated the following from Ibn 'Abbas, which they classed as da’if: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever observes i’tikaf for one day seeking thereby the Face of Allah, Allah will place between him and the Fire three ditches wider than the distance between the east and the west.” This was classed as da’if by al-Albani in al-Silsilah al-Da’ifah, 5345.  
Al-Daylami narrated from ‘Aishah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever observes i’tikaf out of faith and in the hope of reward will be forgiven his previous sins.” Classed as da’if by al-Albani in Da’if al-Jami’, 5442. 
Al-Bayhaqi narrated the following report from al-Husayn ibn ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him), which he classed as da’if: the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever observes i'tikaf for ten days in Ramadan, that will be equivalent to two Hajjs and two ‘Umrahs. This was mentioned by al-Albani in al-Silsilah al-Da’ifah (518) where he said: it is mawdu’ (fabricated).

Warning against arguing about issues of al-qadar on the basis of (human) reasoning","Praise be to Allah.We could talk at length about the Islamic view of the Divine will and decree but to make the subject easier to understand, we will start with an overview of this topic, then explain as much as space permits, asking Allah to benefit us thereby and to accept our efforts. 
What is belief in Al-Qada wal Qadar?
Belief in al-qada (the Divine will) means certain belief that everything that happens in this universe happens by the will and decree of Allah. 
Belief in al-qadar (the Divine decree) is the sixth pillar of faith, and no one’s faith is complete without it. In Sahهh Muslim (8) it is narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) heard that some people were denying al-qadar. He said: “If I meet these people I will tell them that I have nothing to do with them and they have nothing to do with me. By the One by Whom ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar swore, if one of them had gold equivalent to Mount Uhud and he spent it, Allah would not accept it from him unless he believed in al-qadar.” 
Aspects of al-qadar
You should also note that belief in al-qadar is not valid unless you believe in the four aspects of al-qadar, which are as follows: 

Belief that Allah knows all things, in general terms and in detail, from eternity to eternity. Not a single atom is unknown to Him in the heavens or on earth. 
Belief that Allah has decreed all things in al-Lawh al-Mahfuz, fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and the earth. 
Belief that the will of Allah is irresistible and His decree is comprehensive, so nothing happens in this universe, good or bad, but by His will. 
Belief that all that exists was created by Allah. He is the Creator of all beings and the Creator of their attributes and actions, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“Such is Allah, your Lord! La Ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the Creator of all things” [Al-An’am 6:102] 
Prerequisites of belief in al-qadar
Correct belief in al-qadar also involves believing in the following: 

That the individual has free will by means of which he acts, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“To whomsoever among you who wills to walk straight” [At-Takwir 81:28] 
“Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope” [Al-Baqarah 2:286] 

That a person’s will and ability do not operate outside the will and decree of Allah, Who is the One Who has given him that ability and made him able to distinguish (between good and evil) and make his choice, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“And you cannot will unless (it be) that Allah wills the Lord of the ‘Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists)” [At-Takwir 81:29] 

That al-qadar is Allah’s plan for His creation. What He has shown us of it, we know and believe in, and what He has hidden from us, we accept and believe in. We do not dispute with Allah concerning His actions and rulings with our limited minds and comprehension, rather we believe in Allah’s complete justice and wisdom, and that He is not to be asked about what He does, may He be glorified and praised. 

This is a summary of the belief of the first generations concerning this important topic. We will discuss some of this in more detail below, asking Allah to help us to say the right thing: 
Meaning of al-qada wal qadar
In Arabic, the word qada means perfection and completion, and the word qadar means evaluating and planning. 
In Islamic terminology, qadar means Allah’s decree of all things from eternity, and His knowledge that they will come to pass at the times that are known to Him and in the specific manner that He has decreed and willed . They will happen the way they are meant to and the way they are created. 
Is there a difference between al-qada and al-qadar? 
Some of the scholars said that there was a difference between them, but perhaps the most correct view is that there is no difference in meaning between al-qada and al-qadar, and that each of them points to the meaning of the other. 
There is no clear evidence in the Quran or Sunnah to indicate that there is a difference between them. The scholars agreed that the one may be applied to the other, but it should be noted that the word qadar is most usually used in the texts of the Quran and Sunnah, which indicates that we must believe in this pillar. And Allah knows best. 
The status of belief in al-qadar in Islam 
Belief in al-qadar is one of the six pillars of faith which were mentioned in the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when Jibril (peace be upon him) asked him about faith (Iman). He said: “(It is) to believe in Allah, His angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day, and to believe in the Divine will and decree (al-qadar) both good and bad.” Narrated by Muslim, 8. Al-qadar is also mentioned in the Quran, where Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
 “Verily, We have created all things with Qadar (Divine Preordainment of all things before their creation as written in the Book of Decrees Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz).” [Al-Qamar 54:49] 
“And the Command of Allah is a decree determined [qadran maqduran].” [Al-Ahzab 33:38] 
Aspects of belief in al-qadar 
Belief in al-qadar cannot be complete until you believe in the following four aspects of this doctrine: 

Knowledge: this is the belief that the knowledge of Allah encompasses all things and not a single atom in the heavens or on earth falls outside of His knowledge. Allah knew all of His creation before He created them. He knew what they would do by means of His ancient and eternal knowledge. There is a great deal of evidence that points to this such as the verses in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):

“He is Allah, beside Whom La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He) the All-Knower of the unseen and the seen. He is the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.” [Al-Hashr 59:22]
“and that Allah surrounds all things in (His) Knowledge.” [Al-Talaq 65:12] 

Writing: this is the belief that Allah has written the decrees concerning all created beings in al-Lawh al-Mahfuz. The evidence for that is the verse in which He says (interpretation of the meaning):

“Know you not that Allah knows all that is in the heaven and on the earth? Verily, it is (all) in the Book (al-Lawh al-Mahfuz). Verily, that is easy for Allah” [Al-Hajj 22:70]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah wrote the decrees concerning all created beings fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and the earth.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2653) 

Will: this is the belief that everything that happens in this universe happens by the will of Allah. Whatever Allah wills happens and whatever He does not will does not happen. Nothing exists outside of His will. The evidence for that is in the verses where Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):

“And never say of anything, ‘I shall do such and such thing tomorrow.’ Except (with the saying), ‘If Allah wills!’” [Al-Kahf 18:23, 24]
“And you cannot will unless (it be) that Allah wills, the Lord of the ‘Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists).” [At-Takwir 81:29] 

Creation: this is the belief that Allah is the Creator of all things, including people’s actions. Nothing happens in this universe but He is its Creator, because He says (interpretation of the meaning):

“Allah is the Creator of all things.” [Al-Zumar 39:62]
“While Allah has created you and what you make.” [Al-Saffat 37:96]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has made every doer and what he does.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari in Khalq Af’al al-‘Ibad (25) and by Ibn Abi ‘Asim in al-Sunnah (257 and 358); classed as sahih by al-Albani in al-Sahihah, 1637) 
Shaykh Ibn Sa’di (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Just as Allah is the One Who created them – meaning people – He has also created that by means of which they act, namely their abilities and will, then they do various actions of obedience and sin, by the abilities and will which Allah has created.” (Al-Durrah al-Bahiyyah Sharh al-Qasidah al-Taiyyah, p. 18) 
Warning against arguing about issues of al-qadar on the basis of (human) reasoning 
Belief in al-qadar is the real test of the extent of a person’s belief in Allah. It is the true test of how much a person really knows about his Lord and what results from this knowledge of certain and sincere faith in Allah, and His attributes of majesty and perfection. That is because al-qadar raises many questions for the one who gives free rein to his reasoning to try to fully comprehend it.  
There have been many disputes concerning the issue of al-qadar and many people have engaged in debates and misinterpreted the verses of the Quran that mention it. Indeed, the enemies of Islam in all eras have provoked confusion in the Muslims’ beliefs by discussing the issue of al-qadar and stirring up doubts about it. So no one can have true and certain faith except the one who knows Allah by His beautiful names and sublime attributes, submitting to His commands with peace of mind and trusting in his Lord. In that case no doubts or specious arguments can find a way into his heart. 
Undoubtedly this is the greatest proof that belief in al-qadar is more important than belief in the other pillars of faith, and that the human mind cannot independently come to understand al-qadar, because al-qadar is one of the mysteries of Allah in His creation; whatever Allah has disclosed to us in His Book or on the lips of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) we know, accept and believe in, and whatever our Lord has not told us, we believe in and we believe in His perfect justice and wisdom, and that He is not to be questioned about what He does, but they will be questioned. 
And Allah knows best. May Allah send blessings and peace upon His slave and Prophet Muhammad and upon his family and Companions.

49005,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/49005,Ruling on swallowing one’s own saliva or that of someone else,"What is the ruling on a person swallowing his saliva, because I noticed that many people in Ramadan spit a great deal to avoid swallowing their saliva, especially after rinsing their mouths during wudoo’. What is the ruling if the saliva comes from someone else such as his wife’s saliva? Please advise us, may Allah reward you with good.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly : 
The laws of Islam are based on making things easier and on warding off unusual difficulty. Allah says in the verses on fasting (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you” [al-Baqarah 2:185]
And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allah does not want to place you in difficulty, but He wants to purify you, and to complete His Favour to you that you may be thankful” [al-Maa'idah 5:6] 
“and [Allah] has not laid upon you in religion any hardship” [al-Hajj22:78]
Hence if something is usually difficult to avoid and cannot be avoided, it does not affect the fast – which includes a person swallowing his saliva when fasting. 
Ibn Qudamah said: 
What cannot be avoided, such as swallowing one’s saliva, does not invalidate the fast, because avoiding that is difficult. This is similar to dust on the road and the dust from flour. Even if a person lets saliva gather and swallows it deliberately, that does not invalidate his fast because it reaches his stomach in a similar way even if he does not let it gather.""(Al-Mughni, 3/16)
Similarly if he sticks out his tongue with saliva on it, then brings it back in and swallows what is on it (of saliva), that does not break his fast according to the more correct view, because however the tongue moves it is regarded as part of the inside of the mouth, the nature of which cannot change, so it does not matter what is on it (of saliva).""(Haashiyat Qalyoobi, 2/72)
Secondly: 
What the fasting person has to do after rinsing his mouth: 
Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmoo’ (6/327): 
Al-Mutawalli and others said: If the fasting person rinses his mouth he has to spit out the water, but he does not have to dry his mouth with a piece of cloth etc,. There is no scholarly dispute on this point. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: He does not have to spit even after drinking water when he hears the adhaan for Fajr. There is no report from the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) as far as we know to suggest that when a person drinks when dawn breaks he has to spit until the taste of the water disappears. Rather this is an area in which there is lenience.""(Al-Mumti’, 6/428)
Those scholars who think that a person should spit after rinsing his mouth do not ask him to spit more than once after expelling the water from the mouth. The reason why they stipulate spitting is that the water is mixed with the saliva so it does not come out just from spitting it out. But they do not recommend going to extremes in spitting, because all that is left after that is simply wetness and moisture, and cannot be avoided.  
See al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 28/63 
But if anything else is mixed with the saliva that can be avoided, then it is essential to spit it out, then it will not matter if any trace of that is left after that, like a smell etc. This is like what is left from food after suhoor or small pieces that break off the siwaak, or bleeding that comes from the gums. See also questions no. 37745, 37937, 12597. 
Based on this, there is no justification for those who spit a great deal during Ramadan except for being cautious to avoid something which it is not prescribed to be cautious about. This causes dryness in the mouth and makes them thirsty, and makes fasting difficult for them. It also causes them some hardship, especially if they are in places where spitting is not possible or they do not have any handkerchiefs etc with them. This may also cause them not to sit for long in the mosques to recite dhikr or read Qur’aan, so they miss out on these good deeds during this blessed month. 
Thirdly: 
With regard to swallowing his wife’s saliva, Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
With regard to swallowing the saliva of someone else, this invalidates the fast, because he is swallowing something that did not come from his own mouth, so it is likened to swallowing something else. If it is said that ‘Aa’ishah narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to kiss her when he was fasting and suck her tongue (narrated by Abu Dawood, 2386), our response is that it was narrated from Abu Dawood that he said this isnaad is not saheeh. 
Among those who also classed the additional phrase “and suck her tongue” as weak (da’eef) is al-Albaani in Da’eef Sunan Abi Dawood. Ibn Qudamah mentioned two ways of understanding the hadith if we assume that it is saheeh: 
1 – That the two matters are not connected. He said: It may be that he used to kiss her when fasting and suck her tongue at other times. 
2 – The hadith does not refer to swallowing saliva at all. He said: It may be that he sucked it (her tongue) but did not swallow the saliva, because the wetness on her tongue was not transferred to his mouth.""(Al-Mughni, 3/17)
Based on this, if neither spouse swallows the saliva of the other, the fast is not invalidated. 
But nevertheless, one spouse sucking on the tongue of the other comes under the general heading of things that lead to intercourse, and kissing and other things that lead to intercourse are forbidden if there is the fear that a person’s fast will be invalidated by ejaculation. But if he is confident that he can control himself then the correct view is that it is permissible but makrooh, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to kiss his wife whilst fasting. (Al-Bukhari, 1927; Muslim, 1106) 
Al-Mumti’ 6/433. 
But he should guard his fast against anything that may detract from it, especially since these things are permitted during the night in Ramadan.

49006,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/49006,“There is no i’tikaaf except in the three mosque”,"I heard a hadeeth which says that i’tikaaf is only valid in al-Masjid al-Haraam (in Makkah), al-Masjid al-Nabawi (in Madeenah) and al-Masjid al-Aqsa (in Jerusalem). Is this hadeeth saheeh?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly:
The hadeeth to which the questioner is referring was narrated by al-Bayhaqi (4/315) from Hudhayfah, who said to ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with him): I saw some people who were observing i’tikaaf between your house and the house of Abu Moosa (i.e., in the mosque) and I know that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no i’tikaaf except in the three mosques: al-Masjid al-Haraam…” ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood said: Perhaps you forgot and they remembered, or you made a mistake and they were correct. 
This was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Silsilat al-Ahaadeeth al-Saheehah (2876).
Secondly:
With regard to the ruling on this matter, the majority of scholars are of the view that it is not essential for i’tikaaf to be observed in one of the three mosques. They quoted as evidence for that the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And do not have sexual relations with them (your wives) while you are in I‘tikaaf (i.e. confining oneself in a mosque for prayers and invocations leaving the worldly activities) in the mosques”
[al-Baqarah 2:187]
The word masaajid in this verse includes all mosques, except those of which the evidence states that i’tikaaf is not valid therein, such as mosques in which prayers are not held in congregation, if the person who is observing i’tikaaf is one of those on whom prayer in congregation is obligatory. See question no. (  48985 )
Imam al-Bukhaari referred to the general meaning of the verse. He said:
Chapter: I’tikaaf during the last ten days (of Ramadaan) and i’tikaaf in any mosque. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And do not have sexual relations with them (your wives) while you are in I‘tikaaf (i.e. confining oneself in a mosque for prayers and invocations leaving the worldly activities) in the mosques. These are the limits (set) by Allaah, so approach them not. Thus does Allaah make clear His Ayaat (proofs, evidences, lessons, signs, revelations, verses, laws, legal and illegal things, Allaah’s set limits, orders, etc.) to mankind that they may become Al-Muttaqoon (the pious” [al-Baqarah 2:187]. 
The Muslims continued to observe i’tikaaf in the mosques in their countries, as was mentioned by al-Tahhaawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) in Mushkil al-Athaar, 4/205. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about the ruling on i’tikaaf in the three mosques: al-Masjid al-Haraam (in Makkah), al-Masjid al-Nabawi (in Madeenah) and al-Masjid al-Aqsa (in Jerusalem). 
He replied: 
I’tikaaf in mosques other than the three mosques – al-Masjid al-Haraam (in Makkah), al-Masjid al-Nabawi (in Madeenah) and al-Masjid al-Aqsa (in Jerusalem) – is prescribed at the appropriate time, and is not limited to the three mosques. It may be observed in those mosques or in others. This is the view of the imams of the Muslims and the imams of the madhhabs that are followed, such as Imam Ahmad, Maalik, al-Shaafa’i, Abu Haneefah and others – may Allaah have mercy on them – because of the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And do not have sexual relations with them (your wives) while you are in I‘tikaaf (i.e. confining oneself in a mosque for prayers and invocations leaving the worldly activities) in the mosques. These are the limits (set) by Allaah, so approach them not. Thus does Allaah make clear His Ayaat (proofs, evidences, lessons, signs, revelations, verses, laws, legal and illegal things, Allaah’s set limits, orders, etc.) to mankind that they may become Al-Muttaqoon (the pious)”
[al-Baqarah 2:187]
And because the word masaajid (mosques) is general in meaning and includes all mosques throughout the world. This sentence appears at the end of the verses on fasting, the ruling of which applies to the whole ummah in all regions. So it is addressed to all those to whom the ruling on fasting is addressed. Hence these rulings end with the words (interpretation of the meaning): 
“These are the limits (set) by Allaah, so approach them not. Thus does Allaah make clear His Ayaat (proofs, evidences, lessons, signs, revelations, verses, laws, legal and illegal things, Allaah’s set limits, orders, etc.) to mankind that they may become Al-Muttaqoon (the pious)”
[al-Baqarah 2:187]
It is extremely unlikely that Allaah would address the ummah with words that only include a very few of them.  
With regard to the hadeeth of Hudhayfah ibn al-Yamaan (may Allaah be pleased with him): “There is no i’tikaaf except in the three mosques,” even if we assume that this hadeeth is free from faults, it is referring to the most perfect of i’tikaaf, i.e., that which is observed in the three mosques, because of their honoured status and superiority over others. This usage occurs frequently, where the negative is a statement that something is incomplete, not a denial of its validity. For example the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no prayer in the presence of food,” etc. Undoubtedly the basic principle with regard to negative statements is to negate or deny, but if there is evidence to the contrary then that evidence should be followed, as in the hadeeth of Hudhayfah. This is if we assume that it is free of faults. And Allaah knows best. 
Fataawa al-Siyaam (p. 493). 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: How sound is the hadeeth “There is no i’tikaaf except in the three mosques”? If the hadeeth is saheeh, does that in fact mean that i’tikaaf can only be observed in the three mosques? 
He replied: 
I’tikaaf is valid in mosques other than the three mosques, but it is essential that the mosque in which i’tikaaf is observed is a mosque in which prayers are held in congregation. If no prayers are held in congregation there, then it is not valid to observe i’tikaaf there. But if a person has vowed to observe i’tikaaf in one of the three mosques then he is obliged to do so in fulfillment of his vow.

49007,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/49007,The basic goal of i’tikaaf – why have the Muslims forsaken this Sunnah?,"Why have the Muslims forsaken i’tikaaf, even though it is the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)? What is the purpose of i’tikaaf?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
I’tikaaf is one of the confirmed Sunnahs which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did regularly. 
See the evidence for its being prescribed in the answer to question no. 48999. 
This Sunnah has disappeared from the lives of the Muslims apart from those on whom Allaah has mercy. It is like many Sunnahs which the Muslims have virtually forsaken. 
There are several reasons for this, including the following: 
1-Weakness of faith in many hearts
2-Increased focus on worldly pleasures and desires, which leads to an inability to keep away from them even for a short time.
3-Lack on interest in Paradise on the part of many, and their inclination towards leisure and relaxation, so that they do not want to put up with the hardship of i’tikaaf even for the sake of earning Allaah’s pleasure.
Whoever understands the significance of Paradise and the greatness of its delights will sacrifice his life and that which is most precious to him in order to attain it. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The reward of Allaah is precious, the reward of Allaah is Paradise.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani, 2450.
4-Many people pay lip-service to the love of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), without acting upon it and implementing various aspects of the Sunnah, including i’tikaaf. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Indeed in the Messenger of Allaah (Muhammad) you have a good example to follow for him who hopes for (the Meeting with) Allaah and the Last Day, and remembers Allaah much”
[al-Ahzaab 33:21]
Ibn Katheer said (3/756):
This verse represents a major principle: that we should follow the example of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in word and deed in all situations. 
Some of the salaf (early generations of Islam) found it odd that people did not observe i’tikaaf even the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) persisted in doing so. Ibn Shihaab al-Zuhri said: It is strange that the Muslims have given up i’tikaaf when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not give it up from the time he entered Madeenah until Allaah took him (in death). 
Secondly: 
The i’tikaaf which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) always observed at the end of his life is i’tikaaf during the last ten days of Ramadaan. These few days may indeed be regarded as an intensive course of spiritual education which brings immediate positive results in a person’s life during the days and nights of Ramadaan and in the coming days, until the next Ramadaan comes. 
How great is the Muslims’ need to revive this Sunnah and establish it in the proper manner, as the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his companions used to observe it. 
How great will be the success of those who adhere to the Sunnah after the ummah has neglected it and become corrupt.  
Thirdly: 
The basic goal of the Prophet’s i’tikaaf was to seek Laylat al-Qadr. 
Muslim (1167) narrated that Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) observed i’tikaaf during the first ten days of Ramadaan, then he observed i’tikaaf during the middle ten days in a small tent at the door of which was a reed mat. He took the mat in his hand and lifted it. Then he put his head out and spoke to the people, and they came close to him. He said: “I observed i’tikaaf during the first ten days seeking this night, then I observed i’tikaaf during the middle ten days. Then someone came and said to me that it is in the last ten days, so whoever among you wishes to observe i’tikaaf let him do so.” So the people observed i’tikaaf with him. 
This hadeeth teaches us a number of things: 
1-That the basic goal of the i’tikaaf of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was to seek Laylat al-Qadr and to prepare to spend that night in worship. That is because of the great virtue of that night of which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “The Night of Al‑Qadr (Decree) is better than a thousand months (i.e. worshipping Allaah in that night is better than worshipping Him a thousand months, i.e. 83 years and 4 months)” [al-Qadr 97:3].
2-The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) strove to seek that night before he was told when it is. So he started with the first ten days, then he observed it during the middle ten, then he continued to observe i'tikaaf during the last ten days, when he was told that it is in the last ten days. This is the utmost effort to seek Laylat al-Qadr.
3-The Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) followed the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), because they started i’tikaaf and continued with him until the end of the month, because they were so keen to follow his example.
4-The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was compassionate towards his companions and showed mercy to them, because he knew that i’tikaaf was difficult for them. So he gave them the choice between staying with him or of leaving, and said: “…so whoever among you wishes to observe i’tikaaf let him do so.”
There are other aims of i’tikaaf as well, including the following: 
1-Being alone with Allaah and cutting oneself off from people if possible, so that one may focus completely on Allaah.
2-Renewing oneself spiritual by focusing totally on Allaah.
3-Cutting oneself off completely in order to worship Allaah with prayer, du’aa’, dhikr and reading Qur’aan.
4-Protecting one’s fast from everything that may affect it of whims and desires.
5-Reducing permissible worldly pleasures and refraining from many of them even though one is able to enjoy them.

Is it permissible for me to eat and drink when I am in my own city?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    If a traveler comes home not fasting, or if a woman becomes 
    pure following her period, or a sick person recovers during the day, the 
    scholars differed as to whether these people have to refrain from eating and 
    drinking or not? 

    The majority of scholars are of the view that they do not 
    have to refrain from eating and drinking because they were not fasting for a 
    valid reason. 

    But they should not eat and drink openly in front of those 
    who do not know what their excuse is, so that will not be a cause of others 
    thinking badly of them. 

    See al-Majmoo’, 6/167, 168, 173/ 

    Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni: 
With regard to those who 
    are permitted not to fast at the beginning of the day – such as menstruating 
    women, women who are bleeding following childbirth, travelers, young 
    children, the insane, kaafirs and those who are sick – if their excuse for 
    not fasting ceases during the day, and the menstruating woman or woman who 
    was bleeding following childbirth becomes pure, or the traveller’s journey 
    ends, or the child reaches puberty, or the insane person comes to his 
    senses, or the kaafir becomes a Muslim, or the sick person recovers, then 
    there are two reports concerning their situation, one of which is that they 
    should refrain from eating and drinking for the rest of the day. This is the 
    view of Abu Haneefah…. The other view is that they do not have to refrain 
    from eating and drinking for the rest of the day. This is the view of Maalik 
    and al-Shaafa’i. It was narrated that Ibn Mas’ood said: “Whoever eats at the 
    beginning of the day let him eat at the end.”  

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was asked: I heard that you issued a 
    fatwa saying that if a menstruating woman becomes pure during the day in 
    Ramadaan, she may eat and drink and need not refrain from that for the rest 
    of the day, and the same applies to a traveler who comes home during the 
    day. Is this correct? What is the evidence for that? 

    He replied: 

    Yes, what you have heard, that I said that if a menstruating 
    woman becomes pure during the day, she may eat and drink and need not 
    refrain from that for the rest of the day, and that the same applies to a 
    traveler who comes home during the day, is correct. This is one of the two 
    views narrated from Imam Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on him), and it is 
    also the view of Maalik and al-Shaafa’i (may Allaah have mercy on them). 

    It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) said: “Whoever eats at the beginning of the day let him 
    eat at the end.” And it was narrated that the faqeeh Jaabir ibn Yazeed, 
    Abu’l-Sha’tha’, who was one of the imams of the Taabi’een, came home from a 
    journey and found that his wife had become pure from her menses that day, so 
    he had intercourse with her. These two reports were narrated in al-Mughni, 
    without comment.  

    Because there is no point in refraining from eating or 
    drinking, since fasting is only valid if done from Fajr. 

    And it is permissible for these people not to fast at the 
    beginning of the day, even though they know that it is Ramadaan. Allaah has 
    only commanded us to refrain from eating and drinking from the beginning of 
    the day, from the time of Fajr (dawn), but at that time these people were 
    not subject to this obligation, so they were not required to refrain from 
    eating and drinking. 
And Allaah has commanded 
    travelers and menstruating women to make up the fast from other days. If we 
    expect him to refrain from eating and drinking then we would be demanding 
    more of him than Allaah has enjoined. because in that case we would be 
    asking him to refrain from eating and drinking on that day as well as being 
    required to make it up, so we would be expecting him to do two things even 
    though only one of them is required, which is making up the number of days 
    missed. This is the clearest evidence that we do not have to refrain from 
    eating and drinking at this time… but we should not eat and drink openly 
    because that may lead to negative consequences. 

    Fataawa al-Siyaam, p. 102. 

    Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmoo’, 6/174. 
If a traveler comes home during the day in Ramadaan and is not fasting, and finds that his wife has become pure from menses or nifaas during that day, or has recovered from sickness and is not fasting, then he may have intercourse with her and does not have to offer any expiation in our view.",Islam Q&A
49009,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/49009,What is meant by the blowing of the Trumpet?,"What is the “Trumpet” mentioned in the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“And the Trumpet will be blown, and all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth will swoon away, except him whom Allaah wills”

[al-Zumar 39:68]? 

How will it be blown?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The word “soor” (translated here as trumpet) means a horn, 
    like a trumpet or bugle. The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) was asked about the Trumpet and he explained it in 
    terms of what the Arabs knew in their own language, as narrated in Sunan 
    al-Tirmidhi (3244) and elsewhere from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah 
    be pleased with him) who said: A Bedouin said: “O Messenger of Allaah, what 
    is the Trumpet?’ He said: “A horn that is blown into.” Classed as saheeh by 
    al-Albaani in al-Saheehah, 1080. 

    With regard to the one who will blow into it, it is well 
    known that he is Israafeel (peace be upon him). Some of the scholars 
    narrated that there is consensus on this, and it is stated clearly in some 
    ahaadeeth. See Fath al-Baari, 11/368. 

    The Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) has told us that the one who will blow the Trumpet has been ready to do 
    so since Allaah created him, as it is narrated in al-Mustadrak from 
    Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him), who said: The Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The gaze of 
    the one who will blow the Trumpet has been fixed since he was entrusted with 
    it, looking towards the throne, ready (to blow it), in case he will be 
    commanded to do so before he blinks, as if his eyes are two shining stars.” 
    Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 1078. 

    The majority of scholars are of the view that the Trumpet 
    will be blown twice: the first time all creatures will swoon and the second 
    time the resurrection will come to pass. This is based on the verse in which 
    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And the Trumpet will be blown, and all who are in the 
    heavens and all who are on the earth will swoon away, except him whom Allaah 
    wills. Then it will be blown a second time, and behold they will be 
    standing, looking on (waiting)”

    [al-Zumar 39:68]

    And it is based on the saheeh ahaadeeth which mention these 
    two blowings and what will follow them. al-Bukhaari (4651) and Muslim (2955) 
    narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Between the two blowings of the 
    Trumpet there will be forty.” The people said, “O Abu Hurayrah! Forty days?” 
    I said: “I am not sure.” They said, “Forty years?” I said: “I am not sure.” 
    They said, “Forty months?” I said: “I am not sure. Then Allaah will send 
    rain down from the sky and they will grow as herbs grow. There is no part of 
    a man which will not decay except a single bone at the base of the coccyx, 
    from which he will be re-created on the Day of Resurrection.”  

    Al-Nawawi said: what is meant by the words of Abu Hurayrah, 
    “I am not sure” is that he could not be certain as to whether what was meant 
    was forty days or years or months; all that he was certain of was that it 
    was forty in general terms. 

    In Saheeh Muslim (2940) it is narrated that 
    ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Amr (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “… then the 
    Trumpet will be blown and no one will hear it but he will bend his neck to 
    one side and raise it from the other side. The first one who will hear it 
    will be a man who is busy in setting right the cistern meant for supplyingwater to the camels. He will swoon and the other peoplewill also swoon. Then Allah will send or He will send down rain which 
    will be like dew and there will grow outof it the 
    bodies of people. Then the trumpetwill be blown 
    again, and they will stand up and begin to look
    around.”  

    Some of the scholars said that the trumpet will be blown 
    three times, including the time when it will be blown and all people will be 
    terrified, which will come before the people swoon. … They based this on the 
    verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And (remember) the Day on which the Trumpet will be blown, 
    and all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth, will be 
    terrified except him whom Allaah will (exempt). And all shall come to Him, 
    humbled”

    [al-Naml 27:87]

    But the fact that swooning is 
    mentioned in one verse and terror is mentioned in another does not mean that 
    they will not happen at the same time when the Trumpet is blown for the 
    first time. Rather they will happen at the same time, so when the Trumpet is 
    blown the people will be terrified, and will swoon as a result and die. 

    They also quoted as evidence some ahaadeeth in which it is 
    mentioned that the Trumpet will be blown three times. 

    But the hadeeth which they quote as evidence is the lengthy 
    hadeeth about the Trumpet, which is a da’eef (weak) hadeeth, as al-Haafiz 
    ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said. And Allaah knows best. See 
    al-Tadhkirah by al-Qurtubi (184); Fath al-Baari, 11/369. 
From the above it may be 
    understood that when Allaah decrees that all living beings should die, He 
    will command the angel to blow the Trumpet, so he will give a mighty blast 
    which will terrify all creatures, as a result of which they will swoon and 
    die. Then they will stay like that for as long as Allaah decrees, which is 
    described as forty without specifying whether that is years, months or days 
    – Allaah knows best how long it is. Their bodies will decay within this 
    period until there is nothing left but the bone from the base of the coccyx, 
    which is a round bone at the base of the spine. Then Allaah will send a 
    cloud that will release rain, and when the water reaches this bone, the body 
    will grow from it like a plant grows and they will be recreated from this 
    bone, just as Allaah created them the first time, for He is able to do all 
    things. Then he will blow the Trumpet to signal the Resurrection, and the 
    souls will return to their bodies and will come forth from their graves and 
    hasten to the place of gathering. We ask Allaah for His mercy and kindness. 

    What the Muslim has to do is to prepare for these decisive 
    moments by hastening to do righteous deeds and keeping away from evil things 
    and bad deeds. 

    If the one who most feared Allaah said, “How can Ibe at ease when the one who blows the trumpet hasput it to his mouth, bent hisforehead and 
    inclined his ear, waiting to see when he will be ordered toblow it?” – as narrated by al-Tirmidhi in al-Sunan, 243, and 
    others, and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah, 1079 – 
    then what about us who are weak and fall short? We ask Allaah to make us 
    among those who will not be grieved by the greatest terror when the angels 
    will meet them (with the greeting), “This is your Day which you were 
    promised.” (cf. al-Anbiya’ 21:103). 

    And Allaah knows best.

The scholars differed greatly as to the reason for this. I have collected more than twenty different opinions, which I have summed up and highlighted those that are weak. Al-Qaadi ‘Abd al-Wahhaab al-Maaliki said: Several opinions have been mentioned concerning that, some of which are likely to be correct but most of which are far-fetched. 
For example: 
1-He did that so that the two routes would bear witness for him, or it was said: so that their inhabitants, jinns and humans, would bear witness for him
2-It was said that it was so as to make them equal because they are blessed by his passing through.
3-It was said that his route to the prayer-place was to his right, and if he came back the same way he would be coming to the left, so he went back by a different route. This requires evidence.
4-It was said that it was to make manifest the symbols of Islam on both routes, or to make manifest the remembrance of Allah.
5-It was said that it was to annoy the hypocrites or the Jews, or to alarm them by showing the large number of those who were with him. Ibn Battaal thought this was most likely to be correct.
6-It was said that it was a precaution against the plots of the two groups, or one of them. This needs verification.
7-It was said that he did that in order to make more people happy or bring blessing to them by his passing through or by their seeing him, and so that he might attend to their needs, answer their questions, teach them, give them charity, greet them with salaam, etc
8-It was said that it was in order to visit his relatives and uphold the ties of kinship.
9-It was said that it was in order to have a change of scene.
10-It was said that that when he went he gave charity and when he came back he had nothing left, so he came back via a different route so that he would not have to refuse anyone who asked of him. This is a very weak view as well as one that requires proof.
11-It was said that that route by which he went was longer than the route by which he came back, and he wanted to increase his reward by taking more steps to get there, but on the way back he was hastening to go home. This is the view favoured by al-Raafi’i, but he stated that it requires evidence and that the reward for taking steps also applies to the way back, as was proven in the hadeeth of Ubayy ibn Ka’b which was narrated by al-Tirmidhi and others.
12-It was said that the angels stand on the roads and he wanted two groups of angels to bear witness for him. 
Ibn al-Qayyim mentioned some of these reasons in Zaad al-Ma’aad (1/449), then he said: 
The most correct view is that he did this for these and other reasons.  
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: If it is said, what is the reason for coming back by a different route? 
The answer is: to follow the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
“It is not for a believer, man or woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decreed a matter that they should have any option in their decision. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, he has indeed strayed into a plain error”

Al-Haafiz said: 
This shows that it is mustahabb for women to come out and attend the Eid prayers, whether they are young or not. 
Al-Shawkaani said: 
This and similar hadeeths indicate that it is prescribed in sharee’ah for women to come out to the prayer-place, with no differentiation between virgins and non-virgins, young or old, menstruating or otherwise, so long as they are not going through ‘iddah (following divorce or death of their husband) or their coming out will be a cause of fitnah or they have an excuse.  
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was asked: what is better for a woman, to come out to the Eid prayer or to stay at home? 
He replied: 
It is better for them to go out to Eid prayer, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoined that the women go out to the Eid prayer, even the adolescent girls and virgins – i.e., women who do not ordinarily go out. He commanded them to go out, and he told the menstruating women to go out but to keep away from the prayer-place. So menstruating women should go out with other women for Eid, but they should not enter the place where the Eid prayer is offered, because the Eid prayer-place is a mosque and it is not permissible for a menstruating woman to stay there, but it is permissible for her to pass through or to take something she needs from it, without staying there. Based on this we say: women are commanded to go out to the Eid prayer and join the men in this prayer, because of the goodness, dhikr and du’aa’ they may experience there. 
Majmoo’ Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 16/210.

But they must go out looking decent, not wearing adornment, makeup or perfume, so that they may combine following the Sunnah with avoiding fitnah.

In the Quran and Sunnah, the will and decree of Allah is divided into two categories: 
-1-
His universal (kawni) will and decree. Nothing happens outside of this will. The kaafir and the Muslim are equal under this will. Acts of worship and acts of disobedience all happen by the will and decree of Allah. 
For example, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“But when Allah wills a people’s punishment, there can be no turning back of it”
[al-Ra’d 13:11] 
“And whomsoever Allah wills to guide, He opens his heart to Islam; and whomsoever He wills to send astray, He makes his breast closed and constricted, as if he is climbing up to the sky”
[al-An’aam 6:125]
-2-  
His legislative (shar’i) will, which applies only to that which He loves and is pleased with. 
For example, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you”
[al-Baqarah 2:185] 
“Allah wishes to accept your repentance”
[al-Nisa’ 4:27] 
“Allah does not want to place you in difficulty, but He wants to purify you”
[al-Maa'idah 5:6]
-3- 
The difference between the two wills. There are differences between the universal will of Allah and His legislative will, which distinguish each from the other. These differences include the following: 
1-The universal will has to do with that which Allah loves and is pleased with, and with that which He does not love and is not pleased with, whereas His legislative will has to do only with that which Allah loves and is pleased with.
2-By His universal will he may decree something not for its own sake, but to serve another purpose, such as the creation of Iblees, for example, and all evil things, because of which many things happen which Allah loves, such as repentance, striving and seeking forgiveness.
His legislative will has to do with that which He prescribes for its own sake, for Allah wants us to obey Him and He loves that, so He prescribes it and is pleased with it for its own sake.
3-His universal will must inevitably come to pass, such as the birth or death of a person, etc.
But His legislative will – such as Allah wanting everyone to believe – does not necessarily come to pass. It may happen or it may not. If it were inevitable that it should come pass then all of mankind would become Muslims.
4-His universal will has to do with the Oneness of Allah’s Lordship and the fact that He is the only Creator, whereas His legislative will has to do with His Divinity and Law.
5-His two wills come together in the case of one who obeys Him. The one who prays – for example – combines both, because prayer is beloved to Allah; He has enjoined it and He is pleased with it and loves it, so it is prescribed by His legislative will in that sense. But the fact that it happens indicates that Allah willed that it should happen, so it is decreed by His universal decree in that sense. Hence the two wills are combined in the case of one who obeys Allah.
His universal will is at work on its own in the case of the disbelief of the kaafir and the sin of the disobedient. The fact that these things happen indicates that Allah willed that they should happen, because nothing happens except by His will. But the fact that Allah does not love them and He is not pleased with them indicates that they happen by His universal will, not by His legislative will. 
His legislative will is at work on its own in the case of a kaafir who starts to believe, or a sinner who starts to obey Allah. These things are beloved to Allah so they come under His legislative will. The fact that they do not happen – even though Allah has enjoined them and loves them – indicates that they come under His legislative will only. 
These are some of the differences between the two wills. Whoever understands the difference between them will avoid many doubts that cause people to stumble and go astray. Whoever looks at people’s actions with this double-faceted understanding will have clear insight, but whoever looks at it on the basis of the universal will only, without the legislative will, or vice-versa, it will be as if he is one-eyed.

Everything that Allah does is good, wise and just.  
Allah does what He does for reasons that are known to Him; His slaves or some of them may know some of those reasons, or their limited minds may be unable to comprehend much of the divine wisdom behind things. General decrees may be for general reasons and universal mercy, such as sending Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And We have sent you (O Muhammad) not but as a mercy for the ‘Aalameen (mankind, jinn and all that exists)”
[al-Anbiya’ 21:107]
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Allah is Most Wise. He does not do anything in vain or for no purpose. This is indicated by His words and the words of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
And Allah knows best. May Allah send blessings and peace upon His Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.

49014,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/49014,Sunnah Acts During `Eid,I would like to know some of the Sunnahs of `Eid and the rulings thereon.,"Sunnah acts during `Eid include: 1- reciting Takbir during the night of `Eid, 2- eating an odd number of dates before leaving for the `Eid prayer, 3- wearing your best clothes, 4- doing Ghusl for the `Eid prayer, 5- offering the `Eid prayer, 6- paying Zakat Al-Fitr, 7- greeting and embracing one another, 8- going out to the `Eid prayer by one route and return by another…",,"Praise be to Allah.Allah has set out several rulings concerning `Eid, including the following: 

It is recommended to recite Takbir during the night of `Eid from sunset on the last day of Ramadan until the Imam comes to lead the prayer. The format of the Takbir is as follows: 

Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar, la ilaha ill-Allah, Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar, wa Lillahi’l-hamd (Allah is Most Great, Allah is Most Great, there is none worthy of worship except Allah, Allah is Most Great, Allah is Most Great, and all praise be to Allah). 
Or you can say Allahu akbar three times, so you say: 
Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar, la ilaha ill-Allah, Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar, wa Lillahi’l-hamd (Allah is Most Great, Allah is Most Great, Allah is Most Great, there is none worthy of worship except Allah, Allah is Most Great, Allah is Most Great , Allah is Most Great, and all praise be to Allah). 
Both are permissible. 
Men should raise their voices reciting this Dhikr in the marketplaces, mosques and homes, but women should not raise their voices. 

You should eat an odd number of dates before leaving for the `Eid prayer, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not set out on the day of `Eid until he had eaten an odd number of dates. He should stick to an odd number as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did. 
You should wear your best clothes – this is for men. With regard to women , they should not wear beautiful clothes when they go out to the `Eid prayer-place, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Let them go out looking decent” i.e., in regular clothes that are not fancy. It is prohibited for them to go out wearing perfume and makeup. 
Some of the scholars regarded it as recommended to do Ghusl for the `Eid prayer , because it is narrated that some of the Salaf did this. Doing Ghusl for `Eid prayer is recommended, just as it is prescribed for Jumu’ah because one is going to meet people. So if one does Ghusl, that is good.
Offering the `Eid prayer . The Muslims unanimously agreed that the `Eid prayer is prescribed in Islam. Some of them say that it is Sunnah, some say that it is Fard Kifayah (a communal obligation) and some say that it is Fard `Ayn (an individual obligation), and that not doing it is a sin. 

They quoted as evidence the fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded even the virgins and women in seclusion, i.e., those who did not ordinarily come out, to attend the `Eid prayer place, except that those who were menstruating should keep away from the prayer-place itself, because it is not permissible for a menstruating woman to stay in the mosque; it is permissible for her to pass through but not to stay there. 
It seems to me, based on the evidence, that it is an individual obligation and that every male is obliged to attend the `Eid prayer except for those who have an excuse. This was the view favoured by Shaykh  Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him). 
In the first Rak`ah the Imam should recite Sabbih isma rabbika  Al-A`ala (Al-A`la 87) and in the second Rak`ah he should recite Hal ataka Hadith ul-ghashiyah (Al-Ghashiyah 88). Or he may recite Surah Qaf (50) in the first and Surah  Al-Qamar (54) in the second. Both options are narrated in authentic reports from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 

If Jumu`ah and `Eid fall on the same day , the `Eid prayer should be held, as should Jumu`ah prayer, as is indicated by the apparent meaning of the Hadith of  Al-Nu`man ibn Bashir (may Allah be pleased with him) which was narrated by Muslim. But those who attend the `Eid prayer with the Imam may attend Jumu`ah if they wish, or they may pray Thuhr.
One of the rulings on `Eid prayer is that according to many scholars, if a person comes to the `Eid prayer-place before the Imam comes, he should sit down and not pray two Rak`ahs, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed `Eid with two Rak`ahs, and he did not offer any prayer before or after it. 

Some of the scholars are of the view that when a person comes he should not sit down until he has prayed two Rak`ahs, because the `Eid prayer-place is a mosque, based on the fact that menstruating women are not allowed there, so it comes under the same rulings as a mosque, which indicates that it is a mosque. Based on this, it comes under the general meaning of the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “When any one of you enters the mosque, let him not sit down until he has prayed two Rak`ahs.” With regard to the fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not offer any prayer before or after the `Eid prayer, that is because when he arrived the prayer started. 
Thus it is proven that we should pray Tahiyyat  Al-Masjid (two Rak`ahs to “greet the mosque”) when arriving at the `Eid prayer-place, as in the case of all mosques, because if we assume from the Hadith that there is no Tahiyyat  Al-Masjid for the `Eid mosque, then we should say that there is no Tahiyyat  Al-Masjid for the Jumu`ah mosque either, because when the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) arrived at the Jumu`ah mosque he would deliver the Khutbah, then pray two Rak`ahs then leave and pray the regular Sunnahs of Jumu`ah in his house, so he did not offer any prayer before it or after it (in the mosque). 
What seems more likely to be correct in my view is that we should pray two Rak`ahs in the `Eid prayer-place to greet the mosque, but we should not denounce one another with regard to this issue, because it is a matter concerning which the scholars differ. We should not denounce others with regard to matters where the scholars differ, unless there is a clear text. So we should not denounce the one who prays (Tahiyyat  Al-Masjid) or the one who sits down without praying. 

One of the rulings on the day of `Eid – `Eid Al-Fitr – is that Zakat  Al-Fitr is due on this day. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoined that it should be paid before the `Eid prayer. 

It is permissible to pay Zakat Al-Fitr one or two days before that, because of the Hadith of Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) which was narrated by Al-Bukhari: “They used to give it one or two days before (`Eid)  Al-Fitr.” If it is paid after the `Eid prayer, it does not count as Sadaqat  Al-Fitr, because of the Hadith of Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him): “Whoever pays it before the prayer, it is Zakat  Al-Fitr, and whoever pays it after the prayer, it is ordinary charity.” 
It is prohibited to delay Zakat Al-Fitr until after the `Eid prayer. If one delays it with no excuse then it is not acceptable Zakah, but if there is an excuse – such as if a person is travelling and does not have anything to give or anyone to give it to, or he is expecting his family to pay it and they are expecting him to pay it, then in this case he should pay it when it is easy for him to do so, even if that is after the prayer, and there is no sin on him because he has an excuse. 

People should greet one another, but that results in prohibited actions on the part of many people, such as men entering houses without any Mahram being present, and also shaking hands with unveiled women. Some of these evils are worse than others. 

We see some people denouncing those who refuse to shake hands with those who are not their Mahrams, but it is they who are the wrongdoers, not he. But he should explain to them and tell them to ask trustworthy scholars to verify his actions and he should tell them not to get angry and insist on following the customs of his forefathers, because they do not make a permissible thing forbidden or a forbidden thing permissible. He should explain to them that if they do that, they will be like those of whom Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And similarly, We sent not a warner before you (O Muhammad) to any town (people) but the luxurious ones among them said: “We found our fathers following a certain way and religion, and we will indeed follow their footsteps.” [Az-Zukhruf 43:23] 
Some people have the custom of going out to the graveyard on the day of `Eid to greet the occupants of the graves, but the occupants of the graves have no need of any greeting or congratulations, because they do not fast or pray Qiyam. 
Visiting the graves is not something to be done especially on the day of `Eid or Friday or any particular day. It was proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) visited the graves at night, as mentioned in the Hadith of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) narrated by Muslim. And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Visit the graves for they will remind you of the Hereafter.” 
Visiting graves is an act of worship, and acts of worship are not acceptable unless they are in accordance with Shari`ah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not single out the day of `Eid for visiting the graves, so we should not do so either. 

There is nothing wrong with what men do on the day of `Eid of embracing one another. 
It is prescribed for the one who goes out to the `Eid prayer to go by one route and return by another , following the example of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). This Sunnah does not apply to other prayers, Jumu`ah or anything else, it only applies to `Eid.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn `Uthaymin, 16/216-223)",Islam Q&A
49015,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/49015,Ruling on lender accepting a gift from the borrower,"Someone borrowed some money from me, and he gave me a gift before he paid back the loan. What is the ruling on my accepting this gift?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.If the person who borrowed from you was in the habit of giving you gifts before the loan, such as if he was a friend or relative of yours etc, then there is nothing wrong with your accepting the gift in that case, because it had nothing to do with the loan. 
But if this person was not in the habit of giving you gifts, it is not permissible for you to accept it, because it may be because of the loan, and if you accept it you may fall into riba (usury), because the basic principle regarding loans is that “Every loan which brings a benefit is riba,” and this loan will have brought you a benefit. See questions no. 30842 and 39505. 
Also: he may be giving it to you to make you agree to delay asking for repayment, which is also a kind of riba. 
This is indicated by the report narrated by Ibn Maajah (2432) from Yahya ibn Abi Ishaaq who said: I asked Anas ibn Maalik: What if man gives his brother a loan, then (the borrower) gives him a gift? The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If any one of you borrows something then he gives (the lender) a gift or gives him a ride on his riding-beast, he should not accept the gift or the ride, unless they used to treat each other in that manner beforehand.” Classed as hasan by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah in al-Fatawa al-Kubra, 6/159. 
Ibn Sireen narrated that ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) lent Ubayy ibn Ka’b (may Allah be pleased with him) ten thousand dirhams, and Ubayy ibn Ka’b gave him a gift of some fruit from his land, but he returned that to him and did not accept it. Ubayy came to him and said: “The people of Madeenah know that I grow some of the best fruit and I have no need of it, so why did you refuse my gift?” Then later on he sent him (some fruit) and he accepted it. Ibn al-Qayyim said: ‘Umar refused it because he thought that the gift was because of the loan. When he realized that it was not because of the loan, he accepted it. This is the decisive answer concerning the issue of accepting a gift from a debtor. 
Al-Bukhaari narrated in his Saheeh (3814) that Abu Burdah said: I came to Madeenah and met ‘Abd-Allah ibn Salaam (may Allah be pleased with him). He said to me: “You are in a country where the practice of Riba (i.e. usury) is prevalent; so if somebody owes you something and he sends you a present of a load of chopped straw or a load of barleyor a load of fodder then do not take it, as it is Riba.” 
This view was narrated from several of the Sahaabah. Ibn al-Qayyim said in I’laam al-Muwaqqi’een (3/136): It was narrated from more than one of them (i.e., the Sahaabah) – such as Ubayy ibn Ka’b, Ibn Mas’ood, ‘Abd-Allah ibn Salaam, Ibn ‘Umar and Ibn ‘Abbaas – that they forbade the lender to accept a gift from the borrower, and they regarded accepting it as riba.
 Al-Shawkaani said in Nayl al-Awtaar (6/257): 
The point is that if gifts, loans etc are given for the sake of delaying payment of the loan, or as a bribe to the one who gave the loan, or so that the one who gave the loan will benefit as a result of his loan, that is haram, because it is a kind of riba or bribe. But if that is because the lender and borrower used to do that before this loan, then there is nothing wrong with it. If that is not done for any obvious purpose then it seems that the general prohibition should apply in this case.  
Some of the scholars are of the view that it is permissible for the lender to accept a gift from the borrower, but it is better not to do so, to be on the safe side. Ibn al-Qayyim said in I’laam al-Muwaqqi’een (3/136): The Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the way of his companions is more deserving of being followed. 
I say: 
Is there any other solution apart from refusing the gift or falling into riba? 
The answer is: Yes. If you insist on accepting the gift, you have two choices: you can respond in kind, giving something of equal or greater value, or you can regard it as part of the debt and waive the value of the gift from the amount owed. 
Sa’eed ibn Mansoor narrated in his Sunan from ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar that a man came to him and said: I lent money to a man whom I do not know and he gave me a valuable gift. He said: Give his gift back to him, or count it as part of the repayment. 
Sa’eed ibn Mansoor also narrated that Saalim ibn Abi’l-Ja’d said: A man came to Ibn ‘Abbaas and said: I lent twenty dirhams to a man who sells fish and he gave me a fish which I estimated was worth thirteen dirhams. He said: Take seven dirhams from him. 
See al-Fatawa al-Kubra by Ibn al-Qayyim, 6/159. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’ (9/61): 
If someone were to say: So long as this is haraam, why shouldn’t he just give it back in the first place? 
We say: because he may feel too shy or embarrassed to return it, or he may hurt his companion deeply if he gives it back. So we say: Take it, and plan to repay him with a gift of equal or greater value, or to deduct its value from the loan. There is nothing wrong with this. 
What we have stated above about it being haraam applies if the gift is given before the loan is paid off. If it is given after the loan is paid off, there is nothing wrong with accepting it. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’ (9/59): 
If he is given a gift shortly after the loan is paid off or a long time after that, it is permissible.

49016,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/49016,The real meaning of ‘uboodiyyah (true submission to Allaah),I read in question no. 11804 that the purpose for which mankind was created was to devote their worship to Allaah alone. Can you explain to me the real meaning of worship?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.and blessings and peace be upon the Messenger of Allaah. 
‘Ibaadah (worship) in Arabic means submission and humbling oneself. The Arabs use the phrase tareeq mu’abbad to describe a smooth path which has been become smooth because so many feet have walked on it. 
In Islamic terminology the word ‘ibaadah is used in two senses: 
1 – The actions of a person, such as praying or paying zakaah, which are described as ‘ibaadah. The scholars defined it as follows: 
It means obeying Allaah by doing that which He has commanded and avoiding that which He has forbidden, whilst loving Allaah, fearing Him and putting one’s hopes in Him. 
2 – It also refers to the action itself in abstract terms, such as prayer, zakaah, etc. The scholars defined it as follows: 
This is a comprehensive word which includes all word and deeds that Allaah loves and is pleased with, both outward and inward. 
These enjoined actions are called ‘ibaadaat (acts of worship) because people do them in humility and with love for their Lord. In worshipping Allaah there has to be complete love as well as complete submission to Him. 
Our Lord has told us that the ultimate purpose behind the creation of the jinn and mankind is so that they will worship Him alone with no partner or associate. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And I (Allaah) created not the jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone)” [al-Dhaariyaat 51:56]
How can we achieve this purpose and fulfil this goal?
Many people think that ‘ibaadah only refers to a number of rituals that Allaah has commanded should be done at certain times – such as prayer, fasting and Hajj – and that this is the end of the matter. But it is not as these people think. 
How long does it take to do these rituals of worship every day and night. Indeed how long does it take in a person’s lifetime? What about the rest of his life then? What about the rest of his energy? What about the rest of his time? How should it be spent and where does it go? Should he spend it in worship or something else? If he is going to spend it in something other than worship, then how can he fulfil the purpose for which mankind was created, which the verse limited completely to worship of Allaah? How can he fulfil the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say (O Muhammad): Verily, my Salaah (prayer), my sacrifice, my living, and my dying are for Allaah, the Lord of the ‘Aalameen (mankind, jinn and all that exists)” [al-An’aam 6:162]
‘Uboodiyyah is a holistic matter that encompasses the life of the Muslim. When he strives in the land seeking provision he is worshipping Allaah, because Allaah has commanded him to do that, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“so walk in the path thereof and eat of His provision. And to Him will be the Resurrection” [al-Mulk 67:15]
When he sleeps, he sleeps so as to gather strength to worship Allaah, as Mu’aadh ibn Jabal (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “I seek reward for my sleep just as I seek reward for praying qiyaam” (narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4342). Indeed the Muslim is not content unless his pleasure in eating, drinking and marital relations is counted in the scale of his good deeds, as the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “In the intimacy of one of you there is sadaqah (charity, a good deed).” They said: “O Messenger of Allaah, if one of us satisfies his desires will he be rewarded for that?” He said: “What do you think, if you were to do it in a haraam way, would you not have a burden of sin?” They said, “Yes.” He said: “Similarly if he does it in a halaal way he will have a reward.” Narrated by Muslim, 1006. 
The way to attain this great status is for a person always to remember his Lord whatever he is doing in all spheres of life, and to ask himself whether he is in a situation where his Lord will be pleased with him or angry with him. If he is in a situation where Allaah will be pleased with him, then let him praise Allaah and do more good. If it is otherwise then let him seek Allaah’s forgiveness and repent to Him, as Allaah describes His pious slaves as doing when He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And those who, when they have committed Faahishah (illegal sexual intercourse) or wronged themselves with evil, remember Allaah and ask forgiveness for their sins; — and none can forgive sins but Allaah — and do not persist in what (wrong) they have done, while they know.
136. For such, the reward is forgiveness from their Lord, and Gardens with rivers flowing underneath (Paradise), wherein they shall abide forever. How excellent is this reward for the doers (who do righteous deeds according to Allaah’s Orders)” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:135-136]
This is how our righteous forebears, the Salaf and those who followed them, understood ‘ibaadah. They did not limit it just to rituals and the times when they performed those rituals, and make the rest of their lives “outside worship”. Rather any one of them would have felt that his entire life was worship and that the rituals were moments when he could focus and renew his spiritual energy to help him do all the other acts of worship that were required of him. Hence they used to pay a great deal of attention to it  just as a traveller acquires pays a great deal of attention to the supplies that will help him on his way. 
They were as their Lord described them (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Those who remember Allaah (always, and in prayers) standing, sitting, and lying down on their sides” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:191]
In all circumstances they used to remember Allaah verbally and in their hearts. The idea of Allaah’s greatness and fear of Allaah were constantly present in their hearts in everything that they did or said. If one of them made a mistake or slipped, he would correct himself as described in the verse quoted above from Soorat Aal ‘Imraan. 
And you should note that man is a worshipper by nature; worship is instilled in him. So either he will worship Allaah alone, with no partner or associate, or he will worship something other than Allaah, alongside Him or instead of Him – it makes no difference. This kind of worship is that which Allaah called “the worship of the Shaytaan” because it is a response to the call of the Shaytaan. And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):   
“Did I not command you, O Children of Adam, that you should not worship Shaytaan (Satan). Verily, he is a plain enemy to you” [Yaa-Seen 36:60 ].
Man cannot worship both Allaah and the Shaytaan: 
“Is he who walks prone (without seeing) on his face, more rightly guided, or he who (sees and) walks upright on the Straight Way (i.e. Islamic Monotheism)?” [al-Mulk 67:22]
“Say: Is the blind equal to the one who sees? Or darkness equal to light?” [al-Ra’d 13:16]
The Shaytaan tries to lead man away from the worship of Allaah gradually. Sometimes he succeeds on a temporary basis, as in the case of sin, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “No one who commits zina is a believer at the moment of committing zina, and no thief is a believer at the moment of stealing…” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2475; Muslim, 57.  And sometimes he succeeds completely and severs the connection between a person and his Lord, so that he commits shirk or kufr or heresy – we seek refuge with Allaah. 
This worship of the Shaytaan sometimes consists of worshipping whims and desires, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Have you (O Muhammad) seen him who has taken as his ilaah (god) his own vain desire? Would you then be a Wakeel (a disposer of his affairs or a watcher) over him?” [al-Furqaan 25:43]
This person who follows the dictates of his whims and desires – doing whatever he thinks is good and abstaining from whatever he thinks is bad – is obeying the whims and desires of his own self, which calls to him, so it is as if he is worshipping it as a man worships his god. And sometimes it takes the form of worshipping money, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Perish the slave of the dinar and the slave of the dirham and the slave of fine clothing; if he is given he is pleased and if he is not given he is angry. Let him perish and relapse, and if he is pierced by a thorn let him not find anyone to remove it for him…” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2887. 
This applies to everyone whose heart is attached to something other than Allaah of his own whims and desires. If he gets what he wants he is happy and if he does not then he is angry. So he is a slave to whatever he desires, for slavery in fact refers to the enslavement of the heart. The more he is enslaved to these desires, the weaker his submission to his Lord, so if his enslavement to these whims and desires is so strong that it prevents him from adhering to religion completely, then he will become a mushrik and a kaafir. If these whims and desires keep him from doing some of the things that he is obliged to do or they make the idea of doing some of the things that he is forbidden to do, but which do not put a person beyond the pale of Islam, seem attractive to him, then that affects his submission to his Lord and his faith, to the extent to which they keep him from fulfilling his religious commitment.  
We ask Allaah to bless us by enabling us to submit completely to Him, and to make us among His sincere slaves and close friends, for He is All-hearing, Ever-Near and Ever-Responsive. And Allaah knows best. 
May Allaah send blessings and peace upon His slave and Prophet Muhammad and upon his family and companions.

    The contemporary scholars differed concerning the ruling on 
    lightening the eyebrows. Some of them said it is not allowed, as stated in 
    the answer of the Standing Committee to the following question: 

    Recently it has become a common practice among women to 
    lighten the eyebrows; they dye the top and bottom of the eyebrows so that 
    they look as if they have been plucked and thinned. This is obviously done 
    in imitation of the west. The substance used for dyeing is also dangerous to 
    the hair from a medical point of view. What is the Islamic ruling on doing 
    such things? 

    After studying the matter, the Committee for Issuing Fatwas 
    replied: 

    Lightening the top and bottom of the eyebrows in the manner 
    mentioned is not permissible, because it is changing the creation of Allaah 
    and it imitates the plucking that is forbidden in sharee’ah, because it 
    achieves the same effect. The prohibition is even more emphatic if that is 
    done in imitation of the kuffaar or if using it causes harm to the body or 
    hair, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “and do not throw yourselves into destruction”

    [al-Baqarah 2:195]
and the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There should be neither 
    harming nor reciprocating harm.” 

    And Allaah is the Source of strength. 

    Fatwa no 21778, dated 29/12/1421 AH. 

    Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah al-Jibreen (may Allaah preserve him) 
    said: 

    I think that it is not permissible to use these dyes and 
    change the colour of the eyebrows because the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed those who pluck the eyebrows, those 
    who have that done, and those who change the creation of Allaah. By His 
    wisdom Allaah has created differences in eyebrows; some are heavy, some are 
    fine, some are long and some are short. This is one of the ways in which we 
    can tell people apart, and know each person by his own characteristics. 
    Based on this, it is not permissible to dye them because it is changing the 
    creation of Allaah. 

    Fataawa al-Mar’ah, compiled by 
    Khaalid al-Juraysi, p. 134. 

    Other scholars have said that it is permissible, such as 
    Shaykh Muhammad al-Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen. See questions no.
    8605 and
    11168. 

    So this is an area concerning which the scholars have 
    differed. 

    But it is better and more on the safe side not to do that. 

    Those who are qualified to engage in ijtihaad should do what 
    they think; those who are qualified in the area of tarjeeh [comparing 
    opinions and deciding which are more likely to be correct] should do what 
    they think is most likely to be correct; the ordinary people should follow 
    the trustworthy scholars in their own lands or those whose fatwas reach 
    them.

49019,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/49019,"Making Up Missed Prayers, in What Order?",Suppose I miss out 2 prayers. Now in which sequence should I complete my prayers.,"It is obligatory to make up missed prayers in the proper order, according to the majority of scholars. Whoever misses Dhuhr and `Asr, for example, should pray Dhuhr first, then `Asr. However, if a person owes two prayers, Dhuhr and `Asr for example, and starts with `Asr by mistake or because he is unaware that the missed prayers should be offered in order, his prayer is valid.","Making up missed prayers, in what order?


Should you offer the current prayer or the prayer you missed?","Praise be to Allah.Making up missed prayers, in what order?
It is obligatory to make up missed prayers in the proper order, according to the majority of scholars. 
Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said (Al-Mughni, 1/352): 
“In conclusion, it is essential to offer missed prayers in order. This was stated by Ahmad in several places… and a similar view was narrated from An-Nakha’i, Adh-Dhuhri, Rabi`ah, Yahya Al-Ansari, Malik, Al-Layth, Abu Hanifah and Is-haq. 
Ash-Shafi`i said: It is not essential, because one is making up an obligatory prayer that has been missed, so it is not essential to offer them in order, as with fasting… Once this is established, then it is essential to offer them in order even if they are many. This was stated by Ahmad. 
Malik and Abu Hanifah said that they do not have to be offered in order if there are more than a day and a night of prayers, because doing that with regard to more than that period would be too difficult. So the obligation is waived, just like making up missed Ramadan fasts in sequence.” (Al-Mughni, 1/352)
From this it may be understood that offering missed prayers should be done in sequence according to the majority of Hanafis, Malikis and Hanbalis, except that the Hanafis and Malikis do not say it is obligatory if the prayers of more than one day and one night have been missed. 
The way in which the missed prayers are made up in order is to do the missed prayers in the same order as the prescribed prayers. So whoever misses Dhuhr and `Asr, for example, should pray Dhuhr first, then `Asr. 
But the obligation to do them in order is waived in the case of one who forgets or was ignorant, or if there is the fear that the time for the current prayer will end soon, or if one fears missing out on a prayer in congregation – according to the more correct view. 
If a person owes two prayers, Dhuhr and `Asr for example, and starts with `Asr by mistake or because he is unaware that the missed prayers should be offered in order, his prayer is valid. 
If he fears that if he starts with the prayers he missed the time for `Asr prayer will end, then he should pray `Asr first, then pray whatever prayers he owes. 
Should you offer the current prayer or the prayer you missed?
Similarly if he enters the mosque, should he offer the current prayer with the congregation or make up what he has missed first? Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him), according to one report which was also favoured by Shaykh Al-Islam (may Allah have mercy on him), was of the view that he does not have to offer the prayers in sequence if he fears that he will miss out on praying with the congregation. 
But in this case he should join the congregation with the intention of offering the missed prayer. So if a person has missed Dhuhr and he comes to the mosque and they are praying `Asr, he can pray with the congregation with the intention of praying Dhuhr, and it does not matter if his intention is different from that of the Imam . Then he can pray `Asr after that. (See Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti`, 2/138-144)

49020,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/49020,Guidance of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) regarding Eid prayers,I would like to know the guidance of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) regarding Eid prayers.,,,"Praise be to Allah.The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to offer the Eid prayers in the prayer-place (musalla). There is no report of his offering the Eid prayer in his mosque. 
Al-Shaafa’i said in al-Umm: It was narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to go out on the two Eids to the prayer-place in Madeenah, as did those (caliphs) who came after him, unless there was an excuse such as rain etc. The people of other lands did likewise, apart from the people of Makkah. 
He used to wear his most beautiful garments to go out to pray. He had a suit (hullah) which he would wear for Eid and Jumu’ah (Friday prayer). A hullah is a two-piece suit of the same kind of fabric. 
He used to eat dates before going out on Eid al-Fitr, and he would eat an odd number of them. 
Al-Bukhari (953) narrated that Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not go out on the morning of Eid al-Fitr until he had eaten some dates, and he would eat an odd number. 
Ibn Qudamah said: We do not know of any differing opinion concerning the fact that it is mustahabb to eat early on the day of Eid al-Fitr. 
The reason for eating before the prayer is so that no one will think that it is essential to fast until the prayer has been offered. 
And it was said that this was in order to hasten to obey the command of Allah Who enjoined breaking the fast after He enjoined fasting. 
If no dates are available, he should have something else for breakfast, even if it is only water, so that he can fulfil the Sunnah in principle, which is to have something for breakfast before praying on Eid al-Fitr. 
With regard to Eid al-Adha, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used not to eat anything until he came back from the prayer-place, then he would eat some of the meat of his sacrifice. 
It was narrated that he used to do ghusl for both Eids. Ibn al-Qayyim said: Two weak (da’eef) hadeeths have been narrated concerning this… but it was proven from Ibn ‘Umar, who was very keen to follow the Sunnah, that he used to do ghusl before going out on the day of Eid. 
And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to go out to the Eid prayer walking, and come back walking. 
Ibn Maajah (1295) narrated that Ibn ‘Umar said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to go out to the Eid (prayer) walking and come back walking. Classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah. 
Al-Tirmidhi (530) narrated that ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib said: It is Sunnah to go out to the Eid (prayer) walking. Classed as hasan by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
Al-Tirmidhi said: Most of the scholars followed this hadeeth and said that it is mustahabb for a man to go out to the Eid (prayer) walking. It is mustahabb for him not to ride unless he has an excuse. 
When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) reached the prayer-place, he would begin the prayer with no adhaan or iqaamah, and without saying “Al-salaatu jaami’ah (prayer is about to begin).” The Sunnah is not to do any of these things. 
And he did not offer any prayer in the prayer-place before or after the Eid prayer. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would start with the prayer, before the khutbah. He prayed two rak’ahs, with seven consecutive takbeers in the first rak’ah, including takbeerat al-ihraam (the takbeer with which the prayer begins), and a brief pause between each two takbeers. There is no report of him saying any particular dhikr between the takbeers, but it was narrated that Ibn Mas’ood would praise Allah and send blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
But Ibn ‘Umar, who was always keen to follow the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), used to raise his hands with each takbeer. 
When he had completed the takbeers, he would start to recite. He would recite al-Faatihah then recite Qaf wa’l-Quran il-majeed (Soorah Qaaf 50) in the first rak’ah and Aqtarabat il-saa’ah wa anshaqqa al-qamar (Soorat al-Qamar 54) in the other. Sometimes he recited Sabbih isma rabbika al-A’la (Soorat al-A’laa 87) and Hal ataaka hadeeth al-ghaashiyah (Soorat al-Ghaashiyah 88). Both were narrated in saheeh reports, but no other soorahs are mentioned in saheeh reports. When he had finished reciting he would say takbeer and bow. When he had finished bowing and prostrating and had stood up again, he would say five takbeers. When he had completed the takbeers he would start to recite again. The takbeer was the first thing that he would do in each rak’ah and his recitation was followed by rukoo’ (bowing). 
Al-Timridhi narrated from the hadeeth of Katheer ibn ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr ibn ‘Awf, from his father, from his grandfather, that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) recited takbeer in the Eid (prayer), seven times in the first rak’ah before reciting Quran and five times in the second rak’ah before reciting Quran. Al-Tirmidhi said: I asked Muhammad – i.e., al-Bukhari – about this hadeeth and he said: There is nothing more sound than this concerning this topic. And I say likewise. 
When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had finished the prayer, he would move away and stand facing the people, with the people sitting in their rows, and he would address them, preaching and exhorting, with commands and prohibitions. If he wanted to dispatch anyone on a mission he would do so, and if he wanted to enjoin anything he would do that.  
There was no minbar on which he would stand, and the minbar of Madeenah was not brought out. Rather he would address them standing on the ground. Jaabir said: I attended Eid prayer with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). He started with the prayer before the khutbah, with no adhaan and no iqaamah, then he stood, leaning on Bilaal, and enjoined us to fear and obey Allah. He preached to the people and reminded them, then he went over to the women and preached to them and reminded them. Agreed upon. 
Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to go out on the day of al-Fitr and al-Adha to the prayer place. He would start with the prayer, then he would go and stand facing the people, with the people sitting in their rows… This hadeeth was narrated by Muslim. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) started all his khutbahs with praise of Allah. It is not narrated even in one hadeeth that he started the khutbah of Eid with takbeer. Rather Ibn Maajah narrated in his Sunan (1287) that Sa’d al-Qaraz, the muezzin of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say the takbeer between the two sermons and he used to say takbeer a great deal throughout the khutbah of Eid. This was classed as da’eef by al-Albani in Da’eef Ibn Maajah. Although the hadeeth is da’eef, it does not indicate that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to begin his khutbah with takbeer. 
It says in Tamaam al-Mannah: Although it does not indicate that it is prescribed to begin the Eid khutbah with takbeer, its isnaad is da’eef and includes one man who is da’eef (weak) and another who is majhool (unknown), so it is not permissible to quote it as evidence that it is Sunnah to say takbeer during the khutbah. 
Ibn al-Qayyim said: 
People differed as to how the khutbah on Eid and on the occasion of prayers for rain (istisqa’) should begin. It was said that they should begin with takbeer and it was said that the khutbah of istisqa’ should begin with prayers for forgiveness, and it was said that they should begin with praise. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: this is the correct view. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to begin all his khutbahs with praise of Allah. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) granted a concession allowing those who attended the Eid prayers either to sit and listen to the khutbah, or to leave. 
Abu Dawood (1155) narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn al-Saa’ib said: I attended Eid (prayer) with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and when he had finished the prayer he said: “We are going to deliver the khutbah, so whoever wants to sit and listen to the khutbah, let him do so, and whoever wants to leave, let him go.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to vary his route on the day of Eid. He would go by one route and come back by another.

Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “There is nothing wrong with one man saying to another on the day of `Eid: Taqabbal Allahu minna wa mink (May Allah accept (this worship) from us and from you).” This was narrated by Ibn Qudamah in Al-Mughni. 
Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked in Al-Fatawa Al-Kubra (2/228): Does the common `Eid greeting that is on people`s lips – “ `Eid Mubarak” etc – have any basis in Shari`ah or not? If there is a basis for that in Shari`ah, what should we say? 
He (may Allah have mercy on him) replied: 
“With regard to the greeting on the day of `Eid , which people say to one another when meeting after the prayer , “Taqabbal Allahu minna wa minkum wa ahalahu Allah `alayka (May Allah accept (this worship) from us and from you and may you live to see another `Eid)” etc, this was narrated from a number of the Companions who used to do that and allow others to do so too, and from the Imams such as Imam Ahmad. But Ahmad said: I do not initiate this greeting with anyone. But if someone greets me in this manner I return his greeting. That is because returning a greeting is obligatory, but initiating this greeting is not a Sunnah that is enjoined, but neither is it forbidden. The one who does it has an example (whom he imitated) and the one who does not do it also has an example (whom he imitated). And Allah knows best.” 
Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the ruling on offering `Eid greetings and is there a particular wording to be used? 
He replied: 
“It is permissible to offer greetings and congratulations on `Eid, and there is no specific greeting. Rather the greetings that people customarily use are permissible so long as no sin is involved.” 
He (may Allah have mercy on him) also said: 
“Some of the Companions offered greetings and congratulations on the occasion of `Eid. Even if we assume that they did not do that, it has now become something customary that people are used to doing, congratulating one another on the occasion of `Eid and on completing the fast and Qiyam.” 
And (may Allah have mercy on him) he was asked: what is the ruling on shaking hands, embracing and congratulating one another after the `Eid prayer? 
He replied: 
“There is nothing wrong with these things, because people do not do these things as acts of worship intended to draw them closer to Allah, rather they do them because they are customary, and to honour and show respect to one another. So long as there is nothing in Shari`ah to indicate that a custom is forbidden, then the basic principle is that it is permissible.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn `Uthaymin, 16/208-210)

The time for stoning Jamrat al-‘Aqabah on the day of Eid, for those who are able to do it, is from sunrise on the day of Eid, and for those who are weak and unable to cope with the crowding – women and children – the time is from the end of the night. Asma’ bint Abi Bakr (may Allah be pleased with her) used to watch out for moonset on the night of Eid (the night before), and when it had set she would go from Muzdalifah to Mina and stone the Jamrah. The end of the time for stoning the Jamrah is sunset on the day of Eid. If there is too much crowding and a person is far away from the Jamrah and wants to delay it until night time, there is nothing wrong with that, but he should not delay it until dawn on the eleventh of Dhu’l-Hijjah. 
With regard to stoning the Jamaraat on the days of al-Tashreeq – the 11th, 12th and 13th of Dhu’l-Hijjah – that starts after the sun has passed its zenith – i.e., midday when the time for Zuhr begins – and lasts until nighttime. If it is too difficult because of overcrowding etc, there is nothing wrong with stoning the Jamaraat at night, until dawn. It is not permissible to stone the Jamaraat on the 11th, 12th and 13th before midday, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not stone them until after midday, and he said to the people: “Learn from me your rituals (of Hajj).” The fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) delayed stoning the Jamaraat until this time, even though it was very hot, and did not do it earlier in the day, when it is cooler and easier, indicates that it is not permissible to stone the Jamaraat before this time. This is also indicated by the fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to stone them from the time when the sun passed its zenith before he prayed Zuhr. This indicates that it is not permissible to stone the Jamaraat before the sun passes its zenith, otherwise doing that would be better so that one could pray Zuhr when its time began, because it is better to pray when the time for that prayer begins. The point is that the evidence indicates that stoning the Jamaraat on the days of al-Tashreeq is not permissible before the sun has passed its zenith. 
Fatawa Arkaan al-Islam, p. 560. 
He also said: 
Stoning Jamrat al-‘Aqabah on the day of Eid ends when dawn comes on the 11th and starts from the end of the night for the weak and others who cannot cope with the crowding. 
With regard to stoning it (Jamrat al-‘Aqabah) on the days of al-Tashreeq, as with the other two Jamrahs it is to be done from when the sun passes its zenith (the beginning of the time for Zuhr prayer) and ends at dawn the following day, unless it is the last of the days of al-Tashreeq, in which case stoning should not be done during the night because that is now the 14th of the month. The days of al-Tashreeq end at sunset on the 13th. However stoning during the day is better unless – because of the large numbers of pilgrims and their thoughtless attitude towards one another – one fears death, harm or unbearable hardship, in which case it is permissible to stone the Jamaraat at night and there is nothing wrong with that. If a person stones them at night even though he does not fear these things, there is also no harm in that, but it is better to be on the safe side in this matter and not stone them at night unless there is a need to do so.

The second degree is iman (faith)


Difference between Islam and Iman


The third degree is ihsan


Categories of ihsan


Reference:","Praise be to Allah.Yes, there are three degrees of Islam, which are: Islam, iman and ihsan. Each of them has a meaning and certain pillars or essential parts. 
The first degree is Islam 
Islam, which in Arabic means submission. In Sharee’ah terminology, its meaning varies according to usage, and it may mean one of two things: 
(1) When the word is used on its own and is not accompanied by the word iman (faith, belief), it refers to the religion as a whole, including both major and minor issues of belief, words and deeds, as in the verses where Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Truly, the religion with Allah is Islam.” [Aal ‘Imran 3:19] 
“and have chosen for you Islam as your religion.” [Al-Ma’idah 5:3] 
“And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him.” [Aal ‘Imran 3:85]
Hence some of the scholars defined it as meaning: Submitting to Allah by affirming that He is One (Tawhid) and submitting to Him by obeying Him and disavowing shirk and its people. 
(2) When it is used in conjunction with the word iman (faith, belief), in which case it refers to outward deeds and words , as in the verses where Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“The bedouins say: ‘We believe.’ Say: ‘You believe not but you only say, “We have surrendered (in Islam),”for Faith has not yet entered your hearts’…” [Al-Hujurat 49:14]
In Saheeh al-Bukhaari (27) and Saheeh Muslim (150) it is narrated from Sa’d ibn Abi Waqqas that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) distributed (Zakah) amongst (a group of) people while Sa’d was sitting there. Sa’d said: But the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) left a man who I thought the best of them all, and did not give him anything. I said, “O Messenger of Allah, why did you leave out So and so? By Allah I regard him as a faithful believer.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Or (merely) a Muslim.” I remained quiet for a while, but could not help repeating my question because of what I knew about him. I said, “O Messenger of Allah, why did you leave out So and so? By Allah I regard him as a faithful believer.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Or (merely) a Muslim.” I remained quiet for awhile, but could not help repeating my question because of what I knew about him. I said, “O Messenger of Allah, why did you leave out So and so? By Allah I regard him as a faithful believer.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Or (merely) a Muslim. I give to one person even though another is dearer to me, for fear that he might be thrown on his face in the Fire.” 
With regard to the Prophet’s words “or (merely) a Muslim,” when Sa’d (may Allah be pleased with him) said to him, “By Allah I regard him as a faithful believer” mean: You do not know about his faith, all you can see is his Islam in the sense of his outward actions. 
The second degree is iman (faith)
Iman (faith), which in Arabic means belief which is committed to submission. In Islamic terminology its meaning varies according to usage and it may mean one of two things: 
(1) When the word is used on its own and is not accompanied by the word Islam, it refers to the religion as a whole, as in the verses where Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Allah is the Wali (Protector or Guardian) of those who believe. He brings them out from darkness into light.” [Al-Baqarah 2:257] 
“and put your trust in Allah if you are believers indeed.” [Al-Ma’idah 5:23]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No one will enter Paradise except the believers.” (Narrated by Muslim, 114)
Hence the Salaf were unanimously agreed that iman means “affirming in the heart – which includes actions of the heart – and saying with the tongue and acting with one’s physical faculties. It increases by doing acts of obedience and decreases by committing sin.” 
Hence Allah limited the word iman to those who adhere to His religion in full, inwardly and outwardly, when He said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The believers are only those who, when Allah is mentioned, feel a fear in their hearts and when His Verses (this Qur’an) are recited unto them, they (i.e. the Verses) increase their Faith; and they put their trust in their Lord (Alone);
Who perform As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as- Salaah) and spend out of that We have provided them.
It is they who are the believers in truth. For them are grades of dignity with their Lord, and forgiveness and a generous provision (Paradise)” [Al-Anfal 8:2-4]
And Allah referred to iman as including all of that when He said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“but Al-Birr is (the quality of) the one who believes in Allah, the Last Day, the Angels, the Book, the Prophets and gives his wealth, in spite of love for it, to the kinsfolk, to the orphans, and to Al-Masaakeen (the poor), and to the wayfarer, and to those who ask, and to set slaves free, performs As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as-Salaah), and gives the Zakât, and who fulfil their covenant when they make it, and who are patient in extreme poverty and ailment (disease) and at the time of fighting (during the battles). Such are the people of the truth and they are Al-Muttaqoon (the pious.” [Al-Baqarah 2:177]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) referred to iman as including all of that in the hadith about the delegation of ‘Abd al-Qays which is narrated in Saheeh al-Bukhari (53) and Saheeh Muslim (17), where he said: “I enjoin you to believe in Allah alone. Do you know what belief (or faith) in Allah alone is?” They said: “Allah and His Messenger know best.” He said: “To bear witness that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, to establish regular prayer, to pay zakaah, to fast Ramadaan, and to give one-fifth of the war-booty (the khums).” 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) described fasting the month of Ramadan out of faith and in the hope of reward as being part of faith; he also said the same concerning spending the night of Laylat al-Qadar in prayer, fulfilling one's trusts, jihad, Hajj, attending funerals, etc. In Saheeh al-Bukhaari (9) and Saheeh Muslim (35) it says: “Faith has seventy-odd branches, the highest of which is saying Laa ilaaha ill-Allah (there is no god except Allah) and the least of which is removing a harmful thing from the road.” It would take too long to mention all the verses and hadiths that speak of this topic. 
(2) When the word iman is used in conjunction with the word Islam. In this case it is understood as referring to inward beliefs as in the hadith of Jibril etc., and as in the hadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) concerning the funeral du’aa’: “O Allah, whomever among us you cause to live, cause him to live in Islam, and whomever among us you cause to die, cause him to die in faith.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1-24; he said it is hasan saheeh. It was also classed as sahih by al-Albani, as stated in Sahih Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 1/299. That is because physical actions can only be accomplished during life, but when one is dying all that is left is the words and actions of the heart.
Difference between Islam and Iman
The point is that when either word, iman or Islam , is used alone, there is no difference between them, rather each of them when used alone refers to the entire religion. If there is any difference between them, then the word Islam refers to outward physical actions and the word iman refers to inward actions of the heart. This is what is indicated by the hadith of Jibreel which was narrated by Muslim in his Sahih (8) from ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab who said: 
One day when we were with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), there appeared before us a man whose clothes were exceedingly white and his hair was exceedingly black, and there were no signs of travel on him. No one among us recognized him. He came and sat down by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and rested his knees against his and placed the palms on his hands on his thighs. He said: “O Muhammad, tell me about Islam.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Islam is to testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, to establish regular prayer, to pay zakah, to fast Ramadan and to go on pilgrimage to the House if you are able to.” He said: “You have spoke the truth.” And we were amazed at his asking that and saying that he had spoken the truth. Then he said: “Tell me about iman (faith, belief),” He said: “It means believing in Allah, His angels, His Books, His Messengers, and the Last Day, and believing in al-qadar (the divine will and decree), both good and bad.” He said: “You have spoken the truth.” He said: “Tell me about ihsan.” He said: “It means worshipping Allah as if you can see Him, and although you cannot see Him, He can see you.” He said: “Tell me about the Hour.” He said: “The one who is being asked does not know more about it than the one who is asking.” He said: “Then tell me about its signs.” He said: “The slave-girl will give birth to her mistress, and you will see the barefoot, naked, destitute herdsmen competing in constructing lofty buildings.” Then he departed and I stayed for a while. Then he said to me: “O ‘Umar, do you know who the questioner was?” I said: “Allah and His Messenger know best.” He said: “That was Jibreel, who came to teach you your religion.” 
The third degree is ihsan
Ihsan means doing something well, perfectly and sincerely. In Islamic terminology its meanings vary according to usage and it may mean one of two things: 
(1) When it is used alone and is not mentioned in conjunction with Islam or iman, it refers to the religion as a whole, as stated above with regard to the words Islam and iman.
(2) When it is used in conjunction with either or both of the words Islam and iman, the meaning is perfecting one’s outward and inward deeds. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained it in a manner that no other created being apart from him (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) could have explained it, because of the gift of concise speech that Allah bestowed upon him. He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “It means worshipping Allah as if you can see Him, and although you cannot see Him, He can see you.” This is the highest degree of Islam. Those who attain this are the foremost in doing good, the ones who will be closest to Allah in the highest degrees of Paradise.
Categories of ihsan
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has told us that the degree of ihsan is of two categories, one of which is higher than the other. 
The first position is the higher of the two: This means worshipping Allah as if you can see Him. This means that a person acts as if he can see Allah in his heart, so his heart is filled with light and the matters of the unseen become almost like that which is visible (i.e., it becomes very real to him). Whoever worships Allah with awareness of His nearness and turning to Him and acts as if he is before Allah and looking at Him is bound to fear Him and venerate Him. 
The second position is that of sincerity and awareness that Allah is always watching. This means that a person acts with an awareness that Allah can see him and is close to him. If a person bears this in mind and acts accordingly, then he will be sincere towards Allah because this awareness will prevent him from paying attention to anyone other than Allah or doing anything for the sake of anyone else. If a person achieves this position, it will become easy for him to reach the position described above. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “and although you cannot see Him, He can see you.” If a person truly understands when worshipping Allah that He can see him and knows all his deeds, hidden and visible, inward and outward, and that nothing is hidden from Him, then it will be easy for him to move from the lower position to the higher, which is the constant awareness that Allah is close to His slave and is with him, because it is as if he can see Him. We ask Allah of His great bounty.

I want to get married and I am looking for a wife with certain features, especially beauty. I know that it is permissible to look at women with the intention of proposing marriage; is it permissible for me to look at women in the street in order to choose the one to whom I will propose marriage? Is it permissible, if I choose some girl and I like her and want to be sure that my family (who live in another country) will like her, to show her to a friend of mine even if it is for a few seconds?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to look at women in the street, because Allah has commanded the believers to lower their gaze. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts). That is purer for them. Verily, Allah is All‑Aware of what they do” [al-Noor 24:30]
If a person opens this door to himself, that is a dangerous matter. At first the Shaytaan makes the idea of proposing marriage attractive to him, until this becomes a regular habit, then he looks at women with no intention of proposing marriage, rather just for the purpose of looking at their beauty. 
The man who wants to get married should not look at the unveiled women in the street, especially in that kaafir country where most of the people are kaafirs or immoral. Rather he should ask virtuous and knowledgeable people about virtuous and righteous women, and approach the matter in the proper manner. 
With regard to looking at women in the street, this is looking at their external beauty only, not their inward beauty which is more important than outward beauty. What is the point if a man marrying the most beautiful of women if she is lacking in good attitude and religious commitment? 
You should check yourself and review the qualities that you want in the woman you choose to marry, the most important of which is that she should be religiously committed and have a good attitude. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “A woman may be married for four things: her wealth, her lineage, her beauty, or her religious commitment. Choose the one who is religiously-committed, may your hands be rubbed with dust (i.e., may you prosper).” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5090; Muslim, 1466) 
The purpose of marriage is not merely to satisfy one’s desires and enjoy intimacy, so that the man need care about nothing more than beauty; rather marriage is more sublime than that. So you should study the true qualities of your potential life-partner, those qualities that will make your life happy and calm, not a temporary happiness that will disappear as desire fades, leaving nothing but trouble and sadness after that. And Allah knows best. 
It is not permissible for you to show your friend the women to whom you propose marriage, and it is not permissible for him to look at her. A man should have protective jealousy (gheerah) concerning his wife and his honour. The Sahaabah were impressed by the strong gheerah of Sa’d ibn ‘Ubaadah (may Allah be pleased with him), and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Are you amazed by the gheerah of Sa’d? I have more gheerah than him, and Allah has more gheerah than me.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 6846; Muslim, 1499.",Islam Q&A
49025,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/49025,What Is Tawhid Al-Rububiyyah?,What is the real meaning of Tawhid al-Rububiyyah?,"Tawhid al-Rububiyyah means affirming that Allah is One and Unique in His actions, such as creation, sovereignty, controlling affairs, provision, giving life and death, sending down the rain, and so on. A person’s Tawhid is not complete unless he affirms that Allah is the Lord, Sovereign, Creator and Provider of all things.","What Is Tawhid Al-Rububiyyah?


Did anyone deny Tawhid al-Rububiyyah?","Praise be to Allah.What Is Tawhid Al-Rububiyyah?
Tawhid al-Rububiyyah means affirming that Allah is One and Unique in His actions, such as creation, sovereignty, controlling affairs, provision, giving life and death, sending down the rain, and so on. A person’s Tawhid is not complete unless he affirms that Allah is the Lord, Sovereign, Creator and Provider of all things, that He is the Giver of life and death, the One Who brings benefit and causes harm, the only One Who answers prayers, the One Who is in control of all things, in Whose Hand is all goodness, the One Who is able to do whatever He wills – which also includes believing in the divine will and decree (al-qadar), both good and bad. 
The mushrikin among whom the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was sent did not disagree with this aspect of Tawhid , rather they affirmed it in general terms, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And indeed if you ask them: ‘Who has created the heavens and the earth?’ They will surely say: ‘The All-Mighty, the All-Knower created them’” [Al-Zukhruf 43:9] 
And they affirmed that Allah is in control of all things and that in His Hand is sovereignty of the heavens and the earth. Thus it is known that affirming the Lordship of Allah is not sufficient for a person to be a true Muslim, rather he must also affirm that which is implied by that, namely the oneness of the divinity of Allah and he must devote his worship to Allah Alone. 
Did anyone deny Tawhid al-Rububiyyah?
This Tawhid – i.e., Tawhid al-Rububiyyah – is not denied by any of the sons of Adam. No one says that the world has two creators who are equal. No one argued with the idea of Tawhid al-Rububiyyah except Pharaoh, who denied it out of arrogance and stubbornness and even claimed – may Allah curse him – to be the Lord. Allah says of him (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Saying: ‘I am your lord, most high.” [Al-Nazi’at 79:24] 
“‘I know not that you have an ilah (a god) other than me’” [Al-Qasas 28:38] 
This was arrogance on his part because he knew that the Lord was someone other than him. As Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And they belied them (those signs) wrongfully and arrogantly, though their own selves were convinced thereof” [Al-Naml 27:14] 
And Allah tells us of Musa when he was debating with him: 
“[Musa (Moses)] said: Verily, you know that these signs have been sent down by none but the Lord of the heavens and the earth” [Al-Isra 17:102] 
So he himself recognized that the only Lord is Allah. 
Similarly the Magians (Zoroastrians) rejected the idea of Tawhid al-Rububiyyah when they said that the world has two creators, darkness and light. However they did not regard these two creators as equal, rather they said that the light is better than the darkness, because it creates good, and darkness creates evil, and that which creates good is better than that which creates evil. Moreover darkness is non-existent and does not  shine, whereas light exists and shines so it is more perfect in and of itself. 
The fact that the mushrikin affirmed Tawhid al-Rububiyyah does not mean that they did so in a complete sense. Rather they used to affirm it in a general sense, as Allah tells us in the verses quoted above. But they had some faults in their beliefs that undermined this concept, such as attributing rain to the stars, and their belief that soothsayers and fortune tellers had knowledge of the unseen, and other forms of shirk concerning the divine Lordship. But these faults are limited compared to their incorrect beliefs with regard to the oneness of the divine nature (Tawhid al-uluhiyyah) and worshipping Allah Alone (Tawhid al-‘ibadah). 
We ask Allah to make us steadfast in adhering to His religion until we meet Him.
And Allah knows best.

49026,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/49026,One who does something forbidden and is unaware of the consequences,What is the ruling on a person who does one of the actions that are forbidden in ihraam and is unaware of the expiation that he has to offer if he does that?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly we should draw attention to the ignorance of many of the pilgrims who perform Hajj and ‘Umrah, which leads them to commit acts that are forbidden in ihraam, or to do acts of worship in ways that are not prescribed. A pilgrim may spend a great deal of money, especially if he is coming from a far-off land, then lose his reward or have it reduced because he is ignorant of what is required of him. 
Hence everyone who wants to perform the rituals must learn the rulings on them before he starts to do them. It was narrated that Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Seeking knowledge is a duty on every Muslim.” Narrated by Ibn Maajah and others; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Takhreej Mushkilat al-Faqar. 
Imam Ahmad said that what this means is that each person must seek the knowledge that he needs, namely how to do wudoo’ and pray, how to pay zakaah for those who have wealth, and how to do Hajj etc. (Jaami’ Bayaan al-‘Ilm by Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr, 1/52). 
Al-Hasan ibn Shaqeeq said: I asked ‘Abd-Allah ibn al-Mubaarak: How much knowledge should people seek to acquire? He said: No one should start to do anything without knowledge; he should ask and learn. This is what people have to do with regard to acquiring knowledge. (al-Faqeeh wa’l-Mutafaqqih by al-Baghdaadi, 45). Hence Imam al-Bukhaari (may Allah have mercy on him) included a chapter in his Saheeh entitled: Baab al-‘ilm qabla al-‘qawl wa’l-‘aml (Learning before speaking and acting).
 This does not mean that everyone has to memorize by heart a book that discusses the rituals of Hajj, rather what every Muslim must do is to learn whatever he needs to know, according to his situation, either by himself, if he is qualified to do so, or by asking scholars, or by accompanying someone who can show him what to do and teach him whatever he should do whenever he needs to know. 
With regard to the things that are forbidden during ihraam, these have been explained in the answer to question no. 11356. 
But if a person does one of these things out of ignorance that Allah had forbidden that when one is in a state of ihraam, then he does not have to do anything (i.e., offer fidyah etc), because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And there is no sin on you concerning that in which you made a mistake, except in regard to what your hearts deliberately intend. And Allah is Ever Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful” [al-Ahzaab 33:5]
But if he knew that this thing he did is one of the things that are forbidden when one is in a state of ihraam, but he did not realize the consequences of this action, then Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:  
This is not an excuse, because a person is excused if he was unaware of the ruling and did not know that this thing is haraam. As for the one who was unaware of the consequences of doing this action, that is not an excuse. Hence if a married man knew that zina is haraam, and he is an adult of sound mind and he was married or previously-married, but he went ahead and committed zina, then he must be stoned. If he says, ‘I did not know that the hadd punishment (for zina) is stoning, and if I had known that the hadd punishment is stoning I would not have done it,’ then we say to him that this is not an excuse, and you must be stoned, even if you did not know what the consequences of zina are. Hence when the man who had had intercourse during the day in Ramadaan came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to ask him what he should do, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told him that he had to offer expiation, even though at the time when he was having intercourse he was unaware of what he would have to do. This indicates that if a person commits a sin and transgresses the sacred limits of Allah, then he must face the consequences of that sin, even if he did not know of its effects when he did it.

Different types of Fidyah for violating Ihram in Hajj","Praise be to Allah.What takes you out of Ihram?
It is prohibited for the pilgrim who is in Ihram for Hajj or `Umrah to shave his hair, cut his nails or cover his head with something that is attached to the head, to wear form-fitting clothes (for men), to wear the face-veil and gloves (for women), to wear perfume on the body or clothes, to hunt game, to enter into a marriage contract, and to have intercourse or engage in foreplay. 
Different types of Fidyah for violating Ihram in Hajj
“If the pilgrim violates Ihram by committing any of its restrictions, then one of the following scenarios must apply: 

He did it because he forgot, or was unaware of the ruling, or he was forced to do it, or he was asleep – in which case he does not have to do anything (i.e., offer any Fidyah )
He did it deliberately, but with an excuse that made it permissible to do something that is ordinarily forbidden, in which case there is no sin on him but he has to offer the Fidyah for doing that. We will explain this in more detail below.
He did it deliberately with no excuse, in which case he has sinned and must offer a Fidyah , of which there are three types:


That for which there is no Fidyah , which is entering into a marriage contract.
That for which the Fidyah is to sacrifice a camel, which is having intercourse before the first stage of Hajj before exiting Ihram .
That for which the Fidyah is to fast for three days , which may be done consecutively or separately, as he chooses; or to sacrifice a sheep of a type that is acceptable for the `Eid sacrifice, or one-seventh of a camel or of a cow instead, and to distribute its meat among the poor and not eat any of it himself; or to feed six poor persons, giving each one half a Sa` of staple food. He is given the choice between these three options if he removes any hair or nails, puts on perfume, touches a woman with desire (but without having intercourse), if a woman puts on gloves or a face-veil , or if a male puts on form-fitting clothes or covers his head.


That for which the Fidyah is to offer something equivalent, namely hunting game. If the game hunted has an equivalent, then he is given the choice of three options:


Slaughtering the equivalent and distributing its meat to the poor
Finding out its value and giving food of an equal value to the poor, giving each poor person half a Sa’
Fasting instead, one day for each poor person he should feed

If there is nothing equivalent to the game that was hunted, then he is given the choice between two things:

Finding out the value of the game that was killed and giving the equivalent in food to the poor, giving each poor person half a Sa’
Fasting instead, one day for each poor person he should feed.” (Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 22/205-206)

49028,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/49028,He is asking about ihraam for children,"If I enter ihraam with my young son, then we find it too difficult with the crowding and other things that happen at Hajj nowadays, can we annul his ihraam after dressing him in those clothes? What do we have to do if we annul it?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    We have already stated that Hajj of children is acceptable 
    according to sharee’ah, but that a child’s Hajj does not count as the “Hajj 
    of Islam” (i.e., the Hajj that is required once in a lifetime. We have 
    already explained what the guardian must do with his child. See questions 
    no. 13636;
    36862,
    14621. 

    In addition to that, the guardian must pay attention to the 
    time when he wants the child to enter ihraam. If it is a time when it is not 
    so difficult for the child to enter ihraam, because there is less crowding 
    and so on, then he may enter ihraam; if it is too difficult for the child to 
    enter ihraam because there is too much crowding during Hajj, or during 
    ‘umrah in Ramadaan, or because his guardian is unable, and so on, then in 
    this case it is better for the child not to enter ihraam, because that may 
    distract him (the adult) from performing properly the rituals that he is 
    required to perform. 

    See al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 7/24. 
But many guardians 
    underestimate these difficulties or think that they will be able to put up 
    with them, then they find that the situation is not as they had thought it 
    would be. The child himself may not be able to remain in ihraam, and it may 
    be difficult for the guardian to make him stay in ihraam. What is the ruling 
    in this case? 

    The well-known view in our madhhab (Hanbali) is that he has 
    to complete it, because Hajj and ‘Umrah must be completed once started. The 
    other view, which is the madhhab of Abu Haneefah (may Allaah have mercy on 
    him) is that he does not have to complete it, because he is not accountable 
    and is not obliged to do the obligatory duties of Islam. 

    This view is more likely to be correct, and it seems to be 
    the view of the author of al-Furoo’ (i.e., Ibn Muflih, the student of 
    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah). 
Based on this, the child 
    may exit ihraam, and he does not have to do anything (i.e., offer any 
    ransom). This is actually kinder to people, because a guardian may think 
    that ihraam is easy for a child, then it turns out to be otherwise, so he is 
    faced with a dilemma. This happens a lot with people nowadays, so if we 
    adopt this opinion, which is more likely to be correct because of the 
    correct reason given for it, this will resolve the dilemma.

Then he did saa’i and cut his hair, then he exited ihraam and had intercourse with his wife, then he did all the rituals of Hajj in full after that. Is his Hajj valid?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Tawaaf is one of the essential pillars of ‘Umrah, which is 
    not valid without it. The tawaaf which counts for ‘umrah is seven circuits, 
    starting and ending at the Black Stone, because the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) did tawaaf in this manner, and he said: 
    “Learn from me your rituals (of pilgrimage).” 

    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The condition 
    of tawaaf is that it should be seven circuits, each starting and ending at 
    the Black Stone. If one circuit of the seven is omitted, his tawaaf does not 
    count, whether he stays in Makkah or leaves and goes back to his country, 
    and that cannot be atoned for by offering a sacrifice or by anything else.
    Al-Majmoo’, 8/21. 

    Based on that, his ‘umrah was not complete, and he did not 
    exit from ihraam for it, and what he did of exiting ihraam and having 
    intercourse with his wife are forbidden actions that he did when he was 
    still in ihraam for ‘umrah. But he did those forbidden actions thinking that 
    he had finished his ‘umrah and exited from ihraam for it. Hence he does not 
    have to offer any fidyah for these actions. See question no. 
    36522.  
    Moreover this man entered ihraam for Hajj on the basis that he was doing 
    Hajj tamattu’, but in fact he had not completed his ‘umrah, so he joined 
    Hajj to ‘umrah, thus in effect he was doing Hajj qiraan. Shaykh Ibn 
    ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about a man who did Hajj 
    tamattu’ and he did an incomplete tawaaf, i.e., only four circuits, then he 
    did saa’i and cut his hair, and he had intercourse with his wife, and then 
    he completed his Hajj. 

    He replied: 

    In effect he has done Hajj qiraan, because he joined Hajj to 
    ‘umrah before tawaaf, because his first tawaaf was faulty. Joining Hajj to 
    ‘umrah means that one is doing Hajj qiraan. There remains the issue of his 
    having exited ihraam, put on ordinary clothes and had intercourse, but he 
    was ignorant, so he does not have to do anything (i.e., offer a fidyah). 
    Based on this, his Hajj is complete, but it was Hajj qiraan, not Hajj

What is Tawheed al-Uluhiyyah?


What is Tawhid al-Asma wa’l-Sifat?


Principles of Tawhid al-Asma wa’l-Sifat","Praise be to Allah.What is tawhid?
Tawhid in Arabic means attributing Oneness to Allah and describing Him as being One and Unique, with no partner or peer in His Essence and Attributes.
The Arabs say wahid, ahad and wahid, all meaning one. Allah is Wahid, meaning that He has no rivals or peers in any way. So Tawhid means knowing Allah is One, with none like unto Him. Whoever does not acknowledge Allah in these terms and does not describe Him as being One with no partner or associate does not believe in Tawhid. 
Shar’i definition of Tawhid
With regard to the Shar’i definition of Tawhid, it means believing in Allah Alone as God and Lord and attributing to Him Alone all the attributes of Lordship and divinity.  
It may be defined as follows: Believing that Allah is One with no partner or associate in His Lordship (rububiyyah), divinity (uluhiyyah) or names and attributes (al-asma wa’l-sifat). 
This word (Tawhid) and its derivatives are used with this meaning in the Quran and Sunnah. For example: 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say (O Muhammad): He is Allah, (the) One [Ahad]. Allah-us-Samad [Allah — the Self-Sufficient Master, Whom all creatures need, (He neither eats nor drinks)]. He begets not, nor was He begotten. And there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him” [al-Ikhlas 112:1-4]
“And your Ilah (God) is One Ilah [ilahun wahidun] (God — Allah), La Ilaha illa Huwa (there is none who has the right to be worshipped but He), the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful” [al-Baqarah 2:163]
“Surely, disbelievers are those who said: ‘Allah is the third of the three (in a Trinity).’ But there is no Ilah (god) (none who has the right to be worshipped) but One Ilah [ilahun wahidun] (God —Allah). And if they cease not from what they say, verily, a painful torment will befall on the disbelievers among them” [al-Maidah 5:73]
And there are many similar verses. 
In Sahih al-Bukhari (7372) and Sahih Muslim (19) it is narrated that Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sent Mu’adh ibn Jabal to Yemen, he said to him: “You are going to people from among the People of the Book, so let the first thing to which you call them be belief in Allah alone (Tawhid). If they accept that, then tell them that Allah has enjoined on them five prayers every day and night. If they pray then tell them that Allah has enjoined on them zakah from their wealth to be taken from their rich and given to their poor. If they agree to that then take it from them but avoid the best of people’s wealth.”  
In Sahih Muslim it is narrated from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Islam is built on five (pillars) : belief that Allah is One, establishing regular prayer, paying zakah, fasting Ramadan and Hajj.” 
What is meant by Tawhid in all these texts is affirming the meaning of the testimony that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, which is the essence of the religion of Islam with which Allah sent His Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), based on the evidence of the words of the Quran and Sunnah. 
In some versions of the hadith of Muadh quoted above it says: “You will come to some people from among the People of the Book so when you come to them, call them to bear witness that there is no god except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1492)
According to another version of the hadith of Ibn ‘Umar: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Islam is based on five (pillars): the testimony that there is no god except Allah and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger...” (Narrated by Muslim, 16)
This indicates that Tawhid is the essence of the testimony that there is no god except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, and that this is Islam with which Allah sent His Prophet to the two races of mankind and the jinn, other than which Allah will not accept any religion from anyone. 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Truly, the religion with Allah is Islam” [Al ‘Imran 3:19]
“And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers” [Al ‘Imran 3:85]
Categories of Tawheed
Once this is understood, it should be noted that the scholars have divided Tawhid into three categories , as follows: 
Tawhid al-Rububiyyah (Oneness of Divine Lordship), Tawhid al-Uluhiyyah (Oneness of Divinity) and Tawhid al-Asma wa’l-Sifat (Oneness of the Divine Names and Attributes). 
What is Tawheed al-Rububiyyah?
Tawhid al-Rububiyyah (Oneness of Divine Lordship): means believing in Allah as One and Unique with regard to His actions such as creation, sovereignty, control, giving life and death, and so on.
There is a great deal of evidence to support this in the Quran and Sunnah. Please see question no. 13532  to learn some of it. 
Whoever believes that there is any creator other than Allah or any sovereign controlling this universe and disposing of its affairs other than Allah has denied this aspect of Tawhid and disbelieved in Allah. 
The kuffar of old accepted this aspect of Tawhid in general terms, although they differed with regard to some of its details. The evidence that they used to accept this is to be found in several verses of the Quran such as the following (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And if you were to ask them: ‘Who has created the heavens and the earth and subjected the sun and the moon?’ they will surely reply: ‘Allah.’ How then are they deviating (as polytheists and disbelievers)?” [al-'Ankabut 29:61] 
“And if you were to ask them: ‘Who sends down water (rain) from the sky, and gives life therewith to the earth after its death?’ they will surely reply: ‘Allah.’ Say: ‘All the praises and thanks be to Allah!’ Nay, most of them have no sense” [al-‘Ankabut 29:63] 
“And if you ask them who created them, they will surely say: ‘Allah.’ How then are they turned away (from the worship of Allah Who created them)?” [al-Zukhruf 43:87]
In these verses Allah states that the kuffar affirm that He is the Creator, Sovereign and Controller, but despite that they do not worship Him alone (Tawhid of worship), which points to the graveness of their wrongdoing and lies, and the weakness of their reasoning. For if there is One Who is described in such terms, none should be worshipped except Him Alone and none should be described as being one and unique except Him; may He be glorified above those that they associate with Him. 
So whoever affirms this Tawhid in the true sense must inevitably also affirm the Oneness of Allah’s Divinity (Tawhid al-Uluhiyyah). 
What is Tawheed al-Uluhiyyah?
Tawhid al-Uluhiyyah means devoting all acts of worship, both inward and outward, in word and deed, to Allah Alone, and not worshipping anything or anyone other than Allah, no matter who he is. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him” [al-Isra 17:23] 
“Worship Allah and join none with Him (in worship)” [al-Nisa 4:36]
It may be described as devoting all one’s actions to Allah Alone.  
It is called Tawhid al-Uluhiyyah because it is based on ta-alluh lillah which is worship and devotion of Allah accompanied by love and veneration. 
It is also called Tawhid al-‘Ibadah (oneness of worship) because it means that a person worships Allah by doing what He has commanded and avoiding that which He has forbidden. 
It is also called Tawhid al-Talab wa’l-Qasd wa’l-Iradah (Oneness of goal, purpose and will) because it means that a person does not seek anything except the Face of Allah, so he worships Him sincerely. 
This is the kind of Tawhid concerning which people went astray, which is why the prophets were sent and the Books were revealed. This is the purpose for which the universe was created and laws were prescribed. Concerning this, disputes arose between the prophets and their peoples, so the stubborn were doomed and the believers were saved. 
Whoever goes astray with regard to this Tawhid, such as devoting some of his worship to someone other than Allah, has gone beyond the pale of Islam and drifted away from true belief. May Allah protect us from that.
What is Tawhid al-Asma wa’l-Sifat?
With regard to Tawhid al-Asma wa’l-Sifat (Oneness of the Divine Names and Attributes ), this means affirming the names and attributes of Allah and believing that there is none like unto Allah in His names and attributes. 
Principles of Tawhid al-Asma wa’l-Sifat
This Tawhid is based on two principles: 
1 – Affirmation: i.e., affirming that which Allah has affirmed for Himself in His Book or that His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has affirmed of His beautiful names and sublime attributes in a manner that suits the Majesty and Greatness of Allah, without distorting them, twisting their meanings, denying their reality or discussing how they are. 
2 – Denial: i.e., denying that Allah has any faults and denying any shortcomings that He has denied Himself. The evidence for that is the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“There is nothing like Him, and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer” [al-Shura 42:11]
So He has denied that He bears any resemblance to His creation, and affirmed that He has attributes of perfection in a manner that befits Him, may He be glorified.

49032,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/49032,"Accepting perfume from another person so as not to offend him, when one is in ihraam","What is the ruling on one who accepts perfume from another person when in a state of ihraam, even though he knows it is haraam and is not permissible for him to use perfume?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The pilgrim in ihraam is not allowed to use any kind of 
    perfume on his body or clothes. 

    With regard to the body, the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, concerning one who died in a state of 
    ihraam: “Wash him with water and lotus leaves, and shroud him in two 
    garments, and do not put perfume on him … for Allaah will raise him up on 
    the Day of Resurrection reciting the Talbiyah.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 
    1265; Muslim, 1206. 

    The words laa tuhannituhu (translated here as “do not 
    put perfume on him”) refer to hunoot, which is a blend of perfume 
    that is used specifically for the dead, and is not used in other 
    circumstances. 

    According to a version narrated by Muslim: “Do not put 
    perfume (teeb – the usual word for perfume) on him.” So the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade putting hunoot 
    on this dead person, which is a kind of perfume as is mentioned in the 
    report narrated by Muslim, even though putting perfume in the water used to 
    wash the dead and in the shroud is usually mustahabb. The Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stated the reason for that, 
    which is that he will be raised up on the Day of Resurrection reciting the 
    Talbiyah, i.e., his ihraam is not annulled by his death. This indicates that 
    the pilgrim in ihraam is not allowed to use perfume. The scholars are 
    unanimously agreed on this point. 

    Ibn Qudaamah said: The scholars are unanimously agreed that 
    the pilgrim in ihraam is not allowed to use perfume. Al-Mughni, 
    5/140. 

    With regard to clothing, the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Do not wear anything that has been 
    touched by saffron or wars (memcylon tinctorium, a plant of 
    Yemen used as a liniment and yellow dye).” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1838; 
    Muslim, 1177. Ibn Qudaamah said: We do not know of any differing opinion 
    among the scholars concerning this matter. Al-Mughni, 5/142. 
Shaykh Ibn 
    ‘Uthaymeen was asked about a man who intended to do Hajj, then another man 
    put perfume on him and he accepted that perfume so as not to offend him, 
    although he knew that perfume is not allowed for the pilgrim in ihraam. What 
    is the ruling in this case?

    He replied: It is not permissible for a person to fear 
    offending another when it is the matter of disobeying Allaah or to disobey 
    Allaah for fear of offending another person. What you should do if perfume 
    is offered to you is to say: “It is not permissible for the pilgrim in 
    ihraam to wear perfume.” 

    This man (the one who gave the perfume to someone else) may 
    be unaware that it is haraam for the pilgrim in ihraam to use perfume, or 
    perhaps he forgot and gave you some… 

    Based on the fact that you did not do that, and you avoided 
    offending him by doing an act of disobedience to Allaah, you have to repent 
    to Allaah from what you did. The scholars say that you have to do one of 
    three things: either sacrifice a sheep in Makkah and give its meat in 
    charity to the poor, or feed six poor persons, giving each one half a saa’ 
    of food, also in Makkah, or fast for three days, even if you do that in your 
    own country. They also say that it is permissible to slaughter the sheep and 
    feed the poor in Makkah, and it is permissible to do that in the place where 
    this sin was committed.

Can he do ‘umrah in his own clothes, and does he have to offer kafaarah (expiation)?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Yes, if a person is unable to wear the ihraam garments,

    According to the scholars he has to slaughter a sheep and distribute its 
    meat to the poor, or feed six poor persons, giving each one half a saa’ of 
    food, or fast for three days.
This is what the scholars said, by analogy with what was 
    narrated about shaving the head, as Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning):
“and do not shave your heads until the Hady reaches 
    the place of sacrifice. And whosoever of you is ill or has an ailment in his 
    scalp (necessitating shaving), he must pay a Fidyah (ransom) of either 
    observing Sawm (fasts) (three days) or giving Sadaqah (charity — feeding six 
    poor persons) or offering sacrifice (one sheep)”
[al-Baqarah 2:196]
And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) explained that fasting means fasting for three days, giving 
    Sadaqah (charity) means feeding six poor persons, giving each one half a 
    saa’, and that sacrificing means slaughtering one sheep. The sacrifice and 
    feeding of the poor in this case should be done in Makkah, in order to be on 
    the safe side, because his breaking the rule concerning clothing will last 
    until he exits ihraam.","Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 21/138"

49037,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/49037,How should one who has caught up with the congregation in the last rak’ah of Maghrib complete his prayer?,"Suppose we are in Magrib prayer and we joined the salat from the second rakat ie from the Tashahud part., then how shall I complete my prayers. Like I normally stand after the salam complete one rakat sit for Tashahud and then complete the third rakat and complete the Tashahud.",,,"Praise be to Allah.If you join the congregation during the first tashahhud of Maghrib prayer, then you should follow the imam in the third rak’ah, and recite the tashahhud, then get up after he says the salaam to complete your prayer. You have two rak’ahs left, so pray the first one with al-Faatihah and another soorah, then recite the tashahhud, which is the first tashahhud for you, then get up for the third rak’ah, and recite al-Faatihah only, and recite the last tashahhud, then say the salam. 
What is stated above is based on the assumption that what the latecomer caught up with with the imam is the beginning of his own prayer, and what he prays on his own is the end of his prayer. This is the opinion of al-Shafi’i (may Allaah have mercy on him). 
Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Majmu’ (4/117): If he catches up with a rak’ah of Maghrib he should stand up after the imam says the salam and pray one rak’ah and recite the tashahhud, then pray a third rak’ah and recite the tashahhud. 
Then he said: 
We have mentioned that our view is that what the latecomer catches up with is the first part of his prayer and what he makes up is the last part. This is the view of Sa’id ibn al-Musayyib, al-Hasan al-Basri, ‘Ata, ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azoz, Makhul, al-Zuhri, al-Awza’i, Sa’id ibn ‘Abd al-‘Aziz and Ishaq. Ibn al-Mundhir narrated it from them and said: This is also my opinion. He said: and it was narrated from ‘Umar, ‘Ali and Abu’l-Darda, but that is not proven. It was also narrated from Malik and was the view of Dawud. 
Abu Hanifah, Malik, al-Thawri and Ahmad said: What he caught up with is the latter part of his prayer and what he makes up is the first part of his prayer. This was narrated by Ibn al-Mundhir from Ibn ‘Umar, Mujahid and Ibn Sirin. They quoted as evidence for that the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “Whatever you catch up with, pray, and whatever you have missed, make it up.” Narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim. Our companions quoted as evidence the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Whatever you catch up with, pray, and whatever you have missed, complete it.” Narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim with many isnads. 
Al-Bayhaqi said: Those who narrated the words “complete it” are greater in number, have better memories and are closer to Abu Hurayrah who is the narrator of this hadith, so they are more correct. Shaykh Abu Hamid and al-Mawirdi said: Completing a thing can only be done after doing the first part of it. Al-Bayhaqi also narrated a view similar to ours from ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab, ‘Ali, Abu’l-Darda, Ibn al-Musayyib, Hasan, ‘Ata, Ibn Sirin and Abu Qilabah (may Allah be pleased with them). 
With regard to the report which says “make it up.” This may be answered in two ways: 
1 – That those who narrated the words “complete it” are greater in number and have better memories 
2 – That qada (the word translated here as “make it up”) is actually to be interpreted as meaning “do it” and not the usual sense in which the word is understood, because this usage is that of the later fuqaha, whereas the Arabs used the word in the sense of doing. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So when you have accomplished [qadaytum] your Manasik (rituals of Hajj)”
[al-Baqarah 2:200] 
“When you have finished [qudiyat] As-Salah (the congregational prayer)”
[al-Nisa 4:103]
Shaykh Abu Hamid said: What is meant is: what you have missed of your own prayer, not what you missed of the imam’s prayer; what the latecomer has missed of his own prayer is the latter part of it. 
It says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah (7/322): 
Question: I would like to know more about how a latecomer should pray: 
1-If the imam has already prayed one or two rak’ahs of Maghrib
2-If the imam has already prayed one or two rak’ahs of a four-rak’ah prayer.
What should he recite? Should he recite al-Fatihah only or another soorah as well? 
Answer:  
Whatever the latecomer catches up with of the prayer with his imam is regarded as the first part of his prayer. So whoever catches up with one rak’ah of Maghrib, that is regarded as being the first part of his prayer. So he should stand up after the imam says the salam and make up what he missed. In the first rak’ah he makes up he should recite al-Fatihah and another surah or verses, because it is the second rak’ah for him. Then he should sit and recite the first tashahhud. Then when he stands up to make up the remaining rak’ah of Maghrib he should recite al-Fatihah only, because it is the third rak’ah for him. Then he should sit and recite the final tashahhud. If what he missed of Maghrib was one rak’ah, and he caught up with two rak’ahs with the imam, then he should recite al-Fatihah only in the last rak’ah that he makes up after the imam says the salam, because it is the third rak’ah for him.  
If it is a four-rak’ah prayer and he catches up with three or two rak’ahs with the imam, then he should recite al-Fatihah only in the one or two rak’ahs that he makes up, because that is the latter part of the prayer for him, so he does not have to recite another surah as well as al-Fatihah. This is the correct scholarly view. And Allah is the Source of strength. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and Companions.

1 – Looking with desire and enjoyment, which is haraam because of the evil and fitnah (temptation) involved
2 – Simply looking with no desire or enjoyment; there is nothing wrong with this according to the correct scholarly view, and this is permissible because it was proven that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) watched the Ethiopians when they were playing in the mosque, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was screening her from them, and he approved of her doing that.

Some sinners and some who fall short (in religious commitment) make excuses for their shortcomings and sins by saying that Allah is the One Who has decreed this for them, so they should not be blamed for it. 
What they say is not correct under any circumstances. There can be no doubt that belief in Al-Qadar is no excuse for failing to do obligatory duties or committing sins, according to the consensus of the Muslims and all those who are wise. 
Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
“No one has the right to make excuses for sin by referring to Al-Qadar , according to the consensus of the Muslims and the followers of other religions, and all those who are wise. If this were acceptable, then anyone could do whatever crosses his mind of murder, seizing people’s wealth and any kind of spreading mischief in the land, and quote Al-Qadar as his excuse. If a person who quotes Al-Qadar as an excuse were attacked by another person who also quoted Al-Qadar as an excuse for that, he would not accept that, and thus he would contradict himself, which in itself is proof that this logic is false. So using Al-Qadar as an excuse is clearly flawed, as is obvious to anyone who has any common sense.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 8/179) 
Shari`ah and common sense indicate that it is invalid to give Al-Qadar as an excuse for committing sin

“Those who took partners (in worship) with Allah will say: ‘If Allah had willed, we would not have taken partners (in worship) with Him, nor would our fathers, and we would not have forbidden anything (against His Will).’ Likewise belied those who were before them, (they argued falsely with Allah’s Messengers), till they tasted Our Wrath. Say: ‘Have you any knowledge (proof) that you can produce before us? Verily, you follow nothing but guess and you do nothing but lie’.”  [Al-An`am 6:148] 
These polytheists quoted Al-Qadar as an excuse for their Shirk, but if their excuse had been valid Allah would not have caused them to taste His Wrath. Whoever gives Al-Qadar as an excuse for sin and shameful behaviour might as well justify the ways of the disbelievers and attribute injustice to Allah as well – Exalted be Allah far above that. 

Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“Messengers as bearers of good news as well as of warning in order that mankind should have no plea against Allah after the (coming of) Messengers. And Allah is Ever All-Powerful, All-Wise.” [An-Nisa’ 4:165] 
If Al-Qadar were an acceptable excuse for committing sin, definitive proof would not have been established by the sending of the Messengers, and indeed there would have been no point in sending the Messengers. 

Allah issues commands and prohibitions to His slaves, but He does not burden them with more than they can bear: 

“So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can.” [At-Taghabun 64:16] 
“Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope.” [Al-Baqarah 2:286] 
If a person were forced to do things, he would be obliged to do things over which he had no control and this is not right. Hence whatever wrongs he commits due to ignorance or being compelled to do them, there is no sin on him for that, because he has an excuse. If this excuse (of Al-Qadar) were valid, then there would be no difference between one who is forced to do something, one who is ignorant and one who does it deliberately. But what is in fact known from real life and basic common sense, is that there is a great difference between them. 

Al-Qadar is something secret and concealed which no one in creation knows until it has come to pass. When a person does something, his will precedes his action, so his will to do it is not based on knowledge of the decree of Allah. So his claim that Allah has decreed that he should do such and such is a false claim, because it is a claim to have knowledge of the unseen, but no one knows the unseen except Allah. So this argument is flawed, because no man can base his evidence on something of which he knows nothing. 
Quoting Al-Qadar as an excuse for sin implies that the laws of Allah are pointless and that the reckoning, resurrection, and reward and punishment will not happen. 
If Al-Qadar were a valid excuse for sin, the people of Hell would have used it, when they see the punishment and realise that they are going to fall into it and when the angels start to rebuke them. But in fact they do not use it as an excuse, rather they say – as Allah tells us (interpretation of the meaning) –  

“ ‘Our Lord! Respite us for a little while, we will answer Your Call and follow the Messengers!’” [Ibrahim 14:44] 
“‘Our Lord! Our wretchedness overcame us.’” [Al-Mu’minun 23:106] 
“‘Had we but listened or used our intelligence, we would not have been among the dwellers of the blazing Fire!’” [Al-Mulk 67:10] 
“We were not of those who used to offer the prayers.” [Al-Muddaththir 74:43], etc. 
If Al-Qadar were a justifiable excuse for sin, they would use it, for they are in the most desperate need of an excuse that would save them from the Fire of Hell. 

If Al-Qadar were a valid excuse for sin, it would have been an excuse for satan who said: 

“ ‘Because You have sent me astray, surely, I will sit in wait against them (human beings) on Your straight path’” [Al-A`raf 7:16 – interpretation of the meaning] 
And Pharaoh the enemy of Allah would have been equal with [Prophet] Musa (peace be upon him), the one with whom Allah spoke. 

Another point that refutes this argument and demonstrates it to be invalid, is the fact that we see how people are keen to get what benefits them in this world. You never see anyone who ignores worldly things that are good for him and doing things that harm him on the grounds that this is what Allah has decreed. Why would anyone turn away from that which will benefit him in spiritual terms and turn to that which will harm him, and then claim that this is what Allah has decreed for him? 

I will give some examples which will clarify that for you: if a person wants to travel to some country, and there are two routes to this country, one of which is safe and secure, and the other is remote and dangerous, with the risk of murder and robbery, which route will he take? 
Undoubtedly he will take the first route. So why, with regard to the Hereafter, does he not take the road to Paradise and avoid the road to Hell? 

Another point that may be used to refute the one who quotes Al-Qadar as evidence, is to follow his own line of reasoning and tell him: “Do not get married, and if Allah has decreed that you should have a son, you will have one, otherwise you will never have a child. Do not eat or drink, and if Allah has decreed that you should be satisfied, that will happen, otherwise it will never happen. If a wild animal attacks you, do not run away from it, and if Allah has decreed that you should be saved, then you will be, and if He has not decreed that you will be saved, running away will not help you. If you fall sick, do not seek treatment, and if Allah has decreed that you will recover then you will do so, but if He has not then medicine will never help you.” 

Will he agree with such comments or not? If he agrees with us, then we will know that his reasoning is not sound. If he disagrees with us, we will know that what he says and the excuses he gives are not valid. 

The one who quotes Al-Qadar as an excuse for sin is likening himself to the insane and minors, who are not accountable and will not be taken to task, but if he were to be treated as they are in this world he would not accept that. 
If we accept this excuse, there would be no need to pray for forgiveness, or repent, or make Du`aa’, or strive in Jihad, or enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil. 
If Al-Qadar were an excuse for shameful behaviour and sin, then there would be anarchy and chaos. There would be no need for hudud and Ta`zir punishments, or other types of penalties, because the wrongdoer would be able to quote Al-Qadar as an excuse and we would not need to punish wrongdoers and bandits or to have courts and a judiciary system, because everything that happens only by the decree of Allah. But no wise man would say such a thing. 
The one who gives Al-Qadar as an excuse says: We will not be taken to task, because Allah has decreed this for us, and how can we be taken to task for something that has been decreed for us? 

We say to him: We will not be taken to task for that which has already been decreed for us, but we will be taken to task for what we do and earn. We are not commanded to do that which Allah has decreed for us, rather we are commanded to do that which is enjoined upon us. There is a difference between what Allah wills for us and what He wants from us. What He wills for us He has kept secret, but what He wants from us He has commanded us to do. 
The fact that Allah knows what we will do from eternity and has written that down is not an excuse, because His all-encompassing knowledge means that He knows what His creation will do, but that does not imply any kind of compulsion. By way of example – and for Allah is the highest description (cf Al-Nahl 16:60) – if a teacher knows that one of his students will not make the grade this year because he is too careless and lazy, then this student fails just as the teacher knew he would, would any wise person say that the teacher forced him to fail, or would the student have any right to say “I did not succeed because this teacher knew that I would never succeed”?! 
In conclusion, quoting Al-Qadar as an excuse for committing sin or for not doing obligatory duties is a false excuse, according to Shari`ah, common  sense and reality. 
It is worth pointing out that many of those who use this excuse do not do so out of conviction and faith, rather they base their argument on whims and desires and stubbornness. Hence one of the scholars said to one such person: “When it comes to obedience you are a Qadari and when it comes to sin you are a Jabari; whatever school of thought suits your whims and desires, you follow it.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 8/107).  In other words, when he did an act of worship or obedience he attributed it to himself and denied that Allah had decreed that, but when he committed a sin he quoted Al-Qadar as an excuse. 
Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said of those who quote Al-Qadar as an excuse: 
“If these people persist in this belief they will be worse disbelievers than the Jews and Christians. (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 8/262) 
Based on this, there is no justification for a person to quote Al-Qadar as an excuse for his faults and sins. 
Al-Qadar may be invoked when calamities befall a person
Al-Qadar may be invoked when calamities befall a person such as poverty and sickness, loss of a loved one, destruction of crops, loss of wealth, accidental killing, and so on. This is a sign of full acceptance of Allah as one’s Lord. In this case referring to Al-Qadar is only valid when it has to do with calamities, not faults. The fortunate one is the one who seeks forgiveness for faults and is patient in the face of calamity, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So be patient (O Muhammad). Verily, the Promise of Allah is true, and ask forgiveness for your fault.” [Ghafir 40:55] 
The doomed one is the one who panics at the time of calamity and quotes Al-Qadar as an excuse for sin. 
The following example will help to explain this further: if a man is speeding in his car and fails to drive safely and causes an accident, then he is blamed for that and called to account, and he gives Al-Qadar as an excuse, that excuse will not be accepted from him, whereas if a person’s car is struck whilst stationary, and another person blames him and he responds by referring to Al-Qadar , this will be acceptable, unless he was parked in the wrong place. 
The point is that whatever a person does and whatever choices he makes cannot be excused by referring to Al-Qadar, but whatever is beyond his will and control may correctly be attributed to Al-Qadar. 
Hence Adam and Musa (peace be upon them) disputed, as is described in the Hadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who said: “Adam and Musa disputed. Musa said to him: ‘You are Adam whose sin caused you to be expelled from Paradise.’ Adam said to him: ‘You are Musa whom Allah chose to convey His message and to speak to; are you blaming me for something that Allah decreed for me before I was created?’ So Adam won the argument with Moses.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2652) 
Adam (peace be upon him) did not quote Al-Qadar as an excuse for his sin as may be imagined by those who do not think about the meaning of the Hadith, and Musa (peace be upon him) did not blame Adam for his sin, because he knew that Adam had asked his Lord for forgiveness and repented, and his Lord had accepted his repentance and guided him, and the one who repents from sin like one who did not sin. 
If Musa had blamed Adam for his sin, he would have replied: “I sinned but then I repented, and Allah accepted my repentance,” or he would have said: “You, O Musa, also killed a soul, and you threw down the Tablets,” and so on. Rather Musa referred to the calamity and Adam responded by referring to Al-Qadar. (See Al-Ihtijaj bi’l-Qadar by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, 18-22) 
Whatever calamities are divinely decreed, we must accept them, for that is part of full acceptance of Allah as one’s Lord. With regard to sins, no one has the right to sin; if he does commit sin then he has to seek forgiveness and repent, so he should repent from sin and be patient in the face of calamity.” (Sharh At-Tahhawiyyah , 147) 
Can the one who repents from sin refer to Al-Qadar as an excuse?
Some of the scholars said that one of those who are justified in referring to Al-Qadar as an excuse is the one who repents from sin, so if anyone blames him for a sin from which he has repented, he may refer to Al-Qadar in this case. 
If it is said to one who has repented: “Why did you do such and such?” and he responds by saying, “That happened by the will and decree of Allah, but I have repented and asked forgiveness,” this excuse is acceptable in his case, because in his case the sin is like a calamity that befell him, and he did not quote Al-Qadar as an excuse for his negligence, rather he is referring to the calamity that befell him, which is disobedience towards Allah. Undoubtedly sin is a kind of calamity, and he is referring to Al-Qadar after the sin took place, and he is admitting his sin. So no one has the right to condemn the one who has repented from sin. What matters is how a person ends up, not the shortcomings that he may commit in the beginning. 
And Allah knows best.

Is zakah due on them or not?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.We have already stated in the answer to question no. 40156 that zakah is not due on an’aam animals [i.e., camels, cattle, sheep or goats] unless they graze for all or most of the year. But if they are fed for half of the year or more, then no zakah is due on them.  
Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni: 
The view of our imam (i.e., Imam Ahmad) and the view of Abu Haneefah is that if they graze for most of the year, then zakah is due on them. Al-Shaafa’i said: If they do not graze for the entire year then no zakah is due on them, because grazing is a condition of zakah being due, so it should be year-round. We have the general meaning of the texts which indicate that zakah is due on livestock. The definition of grazing is not cancelled out if a little fodder is given to the animals, and does not mean that they are not included in this report, because giving a little fodder sometimes cannot avoided, and feeding year-round will waive the zakah altogether; because owners of grazing animals cannot avoid giving their livestock fodder sometimes, such as on cold days and when it snows. 
From al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 23/250. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah was asked about a man who had camels and rented pasture for them during the grazing season – is zakah due on it? 
He replied:  
If they graze for most of the year, and he rents pasture for them for three or four months, he has to pay zakah on them. This is the more clear of the two scholarly opinions. Majmoo’ al-Fatawa, 25/48. 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: 
A man has one hundred camels but for most of the year he feeds them. Is zakah due on them? 
He replied: 
If the flock of camels, cattle or sheep does not graze for the whole year or most of the year, then no zakah is due on them, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stipulated that for zakah to be due, the animals should be grazing. If their owner feeds them for most of the year or half of the year, no zakah is due on them, unless they are for trading, in which case zakah is due on them as trade goods, as in the case of land, cars, etc that are prepared for sale, if their value reaches the nisaab of gold or silver. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said in Fatawa al-zakah (49): 
Flocks which are fed for half the year are not subject to zakah, because the zakah on livestock is only due on animals that graze on plants that Allah causes to grow on the ground for the whole year or for most of the year. But if they are fed for part of the year or half the year, then no zakah is due on them. But if they are prepared for sale, then they come under the ruling on zakah on trade goods. If that is the case, then they are subject to zakah when their value is estimated each year, then one quarter of one-tenth of their value should be paid, i.e., 2.5% of their value. 
It says in al-Sharh al-Mumti’ (6/32): 
If a person has camels that graze for five months and are fed for seven months, then no zakah is due on them. If they graze for six months and are fed for six months, then no zakah is due on them. If they graze year-round, then zakah is due on them. If they graze for seven months and are fed for five months, then zakah is due on them.

4 – Udhiyah (Animal sacrifice)","Praise be to Allah.Merits of the ten days of Dhul-Hijjah
Among the great seasons of worship are the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah, which Allah has favoured over other days. Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There are no days on which righteous deeds are more beloved to Allah than these ten days.” They said: “Not even jihad for the sake of Allah?” He said: “Not even jihad for the sake of Allah, unless a man goes out himself for jihad taking his wealth with him and does not come back with anything.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 2/457)
Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no deed that is better before Allah or more greatly rewarded than a good deed done in the (first) ten days of Al-Adha.” It was said: “Not even jihad for the sake of Allah?” He said: “Not even jihad for the sake of Allah, unless a man goes out himself for jihad taking his wealth with him and does not come back with anything.” (Narrated by Al-Darimi, 1/357; its isnad is hasan (good) as stated in Al-Irwa’, 3/398) 
These texts and others indicate that these ten days are better than all other days of the year, with no exception, even the last ten days of Ramadan. But the last ten nights of Ramadan are better than the first ten nights of Dhul-Hijjah, because they include Laylat al-Qadr, which is better than a thousand months. (See Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 5/412.)
Recommended deeds during Dhul-Hijjah
So, the Muslim should start these days with sincere repentance to Allah, then he should do a lot of righteous deeds in general, then he should pay attention to doing the following deeds: 
1 – Fasting 
It is Sunnah for the Muslim to fast on the first nine days of Dhul-Hijjah . This is because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) encouraged us to do righteous deeds in these days. Fasting is one of the best of deeds, which Allah has chosen for Himself as it says in the hadith qudsi: “Allah says: ‘All the deeds of the son of Adam are for him, except fasting, which is for Me and I shall reward for it.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1805)
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to fast on the first nine days of Dhul-Hijjah. It was narrated from Hunaydah ibn Khalid from his wife, that one of the wives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to fast on the first nine days of Dhul-Hijjah and the day of ‘Ashura’, and three days each month, the first Monday of the month and two Thursdays. (Narrated by Al-Nasa’i, 4/205 and by Abu Dawud; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Sahih Abi Dawud, 2/462)
2 – Reciting tahmid, tahlil and takbir a great deal 
It is Sunnah to recite takbir  (saying Allahu akbar (Allah is most great)), tahmid (saying al-hamdu Lillah (praise be to Allah)), tahlil (saying La ilaha ill-Allah (There is no god but Allah)) and tasbih (saying Subhan-Allah (Glory be to Allah)), during the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah, saying these words out loud in the mosques, homes, streets and every place in which it is permissible to remember Allah, to perform this act of worship openly and proclaim the greatness of Allah. 
Men should recite out loud and women should recite quietly. 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“That they may witness things that are of benefit to them (i.e. reward of Hajj in the Hereafter, and also some worldly gain from trade), and mention the Name of Allah on appointed days, over the beast of cattle that He has provided for them (for sacrifice).” [Al-Hajj 22:28] 
The majority are of the view that the “appointed days” are the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah, because Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the appointed days are the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah.
 ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There are no days that are greater before Allah or in which good deeds are more beloved to Him, than these ten days, so recite a great deal of tahlil, takbir and tahmid during them.” (Narrated by Ahmad, 7/224; its isnad was classed as sahih (sound) by Ahmad Shakir.) 
Formulas of Takbir
The takbir is as follows:
 Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar, la ilaha ill-Allah, Allahu akbar, wa Lillah il-hamd (Allah is Most Great, Allah is Most Great, there is no god but Allah; Allah is Most Great and to Allah be praise).  
And there are other versions. 
This takbir has become a forsaken Sunnah nowadays, especially at the beginning of these ten days. You can hardly hear it except from a few. It should be recited out loud, so as to revive the Sunnah and remind the heedless. 
It was proven that Ibn ‘Umar and Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with them both) used to go out to the marketplace during the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah, reciting the takbir out loud, and the people would recite takbir when they heard them, i.e., the people would remember the takbir and each one would recite it by himself; it does not mean that they recited in unison – that is not prescribed in the Shari`ah. 
Reviving Sunnahs that have been forgotten brings a great deal of reward, as is indicated by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Whoever revives one of my Sunnahs that has died out after I am gone, will have a reward like that of everyone who does it, without that detracting from their reward in the slightest.” (Narrated by Al-Tirmidhi, 7/443; this hadith is hasan (good) because of corroborating reports. )
3 – Doing Hajj and ‘Umrah 
One of the greatest deeds that can be done during these ten days is Hajj to the sacred House of Allah. Whoever Allah helps to go on Hajj to His House and do the rituals in the required manner will – in sha’ Allah – be included in the words of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “An accepted Hajj brings no less a reward than Paradise.” 
4 – Udhiyah (Animal sacrifice) 
One of the righteous deeds that bring a person closer to Allah in these ten days is to slaughter the sacrifice and to look for a good, fat animal and to spend money on it for the sake of Allah. 
Let us hasten to make the most of these great days, before the negligent regrets what he did, and before he asks to go back and receives no response.

49043,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/49043,Does offering the fidyah make up for mistakes a person makes during Hajj?,"Some pilgrims performing Hajj and ‘Umrah are negligent concerning the things they are obliged to do. They pass the meeqaats without entering ihram, for example, or they omit some of the obligatory duties, relying on the fact that they are going to offer a sacrifice which will make up for their shortcomings. What is the ruling on that?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.We have already discussed, in question no. 36522 that the reason for most of the mistakes that pilgrims make during Hajj and ‘Umrah is their ignorance of what is required of them. But what you have mentioned in this question, that some people deliberately commit forbidden acts or are negligent with regard to what is enjoined on them, relying on the idea that the fidyah will make up for those shortcomings, is true ignorance, even if the person who does this thinks that he is aware of the consequences of his actions. No one would dare to transgress the limits of Allah except an ignorant evildoer. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“These are the limits ordained by Allah, so do not transgress them. And whoever transgresses the limits ordained by Allah, then such are the Zaalimoon (wrongdoers” [al-Baqarah 2:229]
No one would dare to transgress the sacred limits of Allah except one who does not truly honour the Symbols of Allah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Thus it is and whosoever honours the Symbols of Allah, then it is truly, from the piety of the hearts” [al-Hajj 22:32]
For this reason the companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say: Every sin that a person commits is due to his ignorance. And Mujaahid said: Everyone who disobeys his Lord is ignorant until he gives up his sin. (Tafseer al-Tabari, 8/89). 
In addition to ignorance of what is required of a person, namely honouring the Symbols of Allah and adhering to His limits and not transgressing them, knowledge should be sought in order to act upon it, not to try to find ways to avoid doing that which Allah has enjoined and transgress the sacred limits of Allah. Where do these people stand in the light of the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Whoever does Hajj for the sake of Allah, and does not utter any obscenity or commit any immoral action, will go back (sinless) as on the day his mother bore him”? (al-Bukhari, 1521; Muslim, 1350). Ibn Hajar said: “or commit any immoral action” means that he does not do any evil deed or sin. 
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “From one ‘umrah to the next is an expiation for whatever (sins) come in between, and an accepted Hajj (Hajj mabroor) brings no less a reward than Paradise.” (al-Bukhari, 1773; Muslim, 1349. 
Ibn Hajar said: Mabroor means accepted. Others said that it means that with which no sin is mixed; al-Nawawi regarded this as being more correct. Al-Qurtubi said: the interpretations that have been suggested are close in meaning, which is that it is the Hajj that is in accordance with the rulings and fulfills all the requirements in the most complete manner. And Allah knows best. 
But here there is some confusion. Perhaps this is the reason why some people do this, i.e., they think that a person has the choice between either doing what is obligatory and avoiding what is forbidden, or offering the required fidyah which is either fasting, giving charity or offering a sacrifice. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said, after mentioning some of the things that are forbidden and the fidyah required for them: 
What we have said here applies to what is required of the one who does this. But this does not mean that the matter is easy or lenient in the sense that if he wishes he may do this thing then offer the expiation and make it up, and if he wishes he may not do it. Rather the matter is more difficult than that, indeed it is a very serious matter, when one dares to transgress the limits of Allah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So whosoever intends to perform Hajj therein (by assuming Ihram), then he should not have sexual relations (with his wife), nor commit sin, nor dispute unjustly during the Hajj” [al-Baqarah 2:197]
I would like to take this opportunity to draw attention to a matter in which some people think that they have the option of not doing what is obligatory and offering the fidyah instead. 
Some people think that when the scholars said that for not doing an obligatory duty (of Hajj) a sacrifice must be offered, that this gives them the choice between doing that obligatory action or of offering this sacrifice and distributing its meat to the poor. 
For example, some people think: “When the day of Eid comes, I will do tawaaf and saa’i, then go home. But I should still stay overnight in Mina and stone the Jamaraat – which are two of the obligatory actions of Hajj – so I will offer fidyah for both of them by sacrificing a sheep…” but this is not the way it is. If it so happens that a person does that, then the fidyah is an expiation for him, but he must repent and seek forgiveness too.

Conditions of plural marriage are: 1- justice and fairness, and 2- being able to afford spending on plural wives.","Ruling on plural marriage


Conditions of plural marriage","Praise be to Allah.Ruling on plural marriage
Allah has allowed men to have more than one wife, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls then marry (other) women of your choice, two, or three, or four; but if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one or (slaves) that your right hands possess. This way you are less likely to commit injustice.” [An-Nisa’ 4:3]
This clearly shows that plural marriage is permissible, and that according to Islamic Shari`ah a man may marry one, two, three or four wives, but it is not permissible for him to marry more than four . This is the view of the scholars of Tafsir and jurists; the Muslims are unanimously agreed on this point and there is no difference of opinion. 
Conditions of plural marriage
It should be noted that there are conditions attached to plural marriage : 

Justice and fairness. 

Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “but if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one” [An-Nisa’ 4:3]. This verse shows that justice is a condition of plural marriage being permissible. If a man fears that he will not be able to treat his wives fairly if he marries more than one, then it is forbidden for him to marry more than one. What is meant by justice here is treating all wives equally with regard to spending, clothing, staying overnight and other material matters which are within his ability to control. 
With regard to justice and equal treatment in the area of love, he is not held accountable for that, and it is not required of him because it is not possible to control it. This is what is meant by the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“You will never be able to do perfect justice between wives even if it is your ardent desire.” [An-Nisa’ 4:129] i.e., with regard to love of the heart. 

Being able to afford spending on plural wives . 

The evidence for this is the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And let those who find not the financial means for marriage keep themselves chaste, until Allah enriches them of His Bounty.” [An-Noor 24:33] 
In these verses, Allah commands the one who is able to get married but cannot afford it to remain chaste. One of the reasons for not being able to afford to get married is not having enough to pay the Mahr (dowry given to the wife) or not being able to spend on one’s wife. (Al-Mufasal fi Ahkam Al-Mar’ah, vol. 6, p. 286) 
Some scholars view that plural marriage is better than restricting oneself to one wife. Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Is the basic principle concerning marriage plural marriage or marriage to one wife? 
He replied: 
“The basic principle in Shari`ah is plural marriage for those who can afford it, if there is no fear of injustice, because of the many interests that are served by that, such as keeping himself and those whom he marries chaste, kind treatment of them, producing lots of children and increasing the numbers of the Ummah and the numbers of those who worship Allah alone. This is indicated by the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls then marry (other) women of your choice, two or three, or four; but if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one or (slaves) that your right hands possess. This way you are less likely to commit injustice.” [An-Nisa’ 4:3]
And because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) married more than one wife , and Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
 “Indeed in the Messenger of Allah (Muhammad) you have a good example to follow.” [Al-Ahzab 33:21] 
One of the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “As for me, I will not eat meat,” and another said, “As for me I will pray and never sleep”; another said, “As for me I will fast and never break my fast,” and another said: “As for me, I will never marry women.” When news of that reached him, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) addressed these people. He praised Allah then he said: “You are the ones who said such and such. As for me, by Allah, I fear Allah more than you do, but I fast and I break my fast, I pray and I sleep, and I marry women. Whoever turns away from my Sunnah has nothing to do with me.” These great words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) include both marriage to one woman and plural marriage.” (Majallat Al-Balagh, issue no. 1015; Fatawa `Ulama Al-Balad Al-Haram, p. 386)

    It is not permissible to exchange low-quality gold for good gold and pay the difference. This is haraam and is not permissible, and the evidence for that is the report narrated in al-Saheehayn and elsewhere in the story of Bilaal (may Allaah be pleased with him) who came to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with some good dates and he said: “Where did you get these from?’ Bilaal said: I had some bad dates and I sold two saa’s of them for one saa’ so that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) might eat from it. The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Oh, do not do this, it is the essence of riba, the essence of riba.” So Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) explained that adding more to things that should be regarded as equal because of the difference in quality is the essence of riba, and it is not permissible to do that. But as he usually did, the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) showed him a permissible way. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told him to sell the bad dates for dirhams, then use the dirhams to buy good dates. Based on this, we say that if a woman has low quality gold or gold that people no longer wear, she can sell it in the market, then take the money and buy good gold. She should do it in this way that was taught to us by our Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).","Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him).  - Fiqh wa Fataawa al-Buyoo’, complied by Ashraf ‘Abd al-Maqsood, p. 386"

Should he say the salaam with the imam or stand up after the imam says the salaam and do another rak’ah?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    He should say the salaam with the imam, because his prayer is 
    complete. With regard to the imam, he is excused for this extra rak’ah. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was asked: If the imam prays five 
    rak’ahs by mistake, what is the ruling on his prayer and the prayer of those 
    behind him? Should a latecomer count this extra rak’ah? 

    He replied: if the imam prays five rak’ahs by mistake, his 
    prayer is valid, and the prayer of those who followed him by mistake or out 
    of ignorance is also valid. 

    But if a person knew that this was something extra, when the 
    imam stood up for the extra rak’ah, he should have sat and said the salaam, 
    because in this case he thought that the prayer of his imam was invalid, 
    unless he feared that his imam stood up for the extra rak’ah because he did 
    not recite al-Faatihah properly (for example) in one of the two rak’ahs. In 
    that case he should wait and not say the salaam. 

    With regard to the latecomer who joined the imam in the 
    second or subsequent rak’ah, this extra rak’ah counts for him. So if he 
    joined the imam in the second rak’ah, for example, he should say the salaam 
    with the imam who prayed an extra rak’ah. If he joined in the third rak’ah, 
    then he should do another rak’ah after the imam says the salaam following 
    the additional rak’ah. That is because if we say that the extra rak'ah does 
    not count for the latecomer, he would have to add another rak’ah 
    deliberately, which would mean that the prayer was invalid. As for the imam, 
    he is excused for the extra rak’ah, because he forgot (and did it by 
    mistake), so his prayer is not invalidated.

Meaning of the Sabians 


Beliefs of the Sabians","Praise be to Allah.Reference to Sabians in the Quran
The Sabians are mentioned in three places in the Quran. The first is the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, those who believe and those who are Jews and Christians, and Sabians [wa’l-sabi-in ], whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and does righteous good deeds shall have their reward with their Lord, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.” [al-Baqarah 2:62]
The second is the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, those who believe (in Allah and in His Messenger Muhammad), and those who are Jews, and the Sabians [wa’l-sabi-in], and the Christians, and the Majus, and those who worship others besides Allah; truly, Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection. Verily, Allah is over all things a Witness.” [al-Hajj 22:17]
And the third is the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Surely, those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah, in His Messenger Muhammad and all that was revealed to him from Allah), and those who are the Jews and the Sabians [wa’l-sabiun] and the Christians, — whosoever believed in Allah and the Last Day, and worked righteousness, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.” [al-Maidah 5:69]
Meaning of the Sabians 
The word sabi (Sabian) is derived from the verb saba-a which refers to the action of leaving one religion and entering another. 
Al-Tabari said: 
“Al-sabiun is the plural of sabi, which means one who has changed his religion, such as an apostate from Islam who has left his religion, or anyone who leaves the religion that he used to follow and joined another. The Arabs called such a person sabi… And it is said in Arabic saba-at al-nujum meaning the stars appeared…” (Tafsir al-Tabari, 2/145; Lisan al-‘Arab under the heading saba-a) 
Beliefs of the Sabians
With regard to the beliefs of the Sabians, Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“The people differed greatly concerning the Sabians, and the imams were unsure about them because they did not have enough knowledge of their beliefs and religion. Al-Shafi’i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: They are a kind of Christian. And he said elsewhere: Their case is to be examined further; if they resemble the Christians in basic matters but they differ from them in some minor issues, then the jizyah is to be taken from them. But if they differ from them in basic issues of religion then their religion cannot be approved of by taking the jizyah from them. 
With regard to the views of the salaf concerning them, Sufyan narrated from Layth that Mujahid said: They are a people who come between the Jews and the Magians and have no religion. In Tafsir Shayban it is narrated that Qatadah said: The Sabians are a people who worship the angels. 
Ibn al-Qayyim said: 
“I said: The Sabians are a large nation among whom are both blessed and doomed. They are one of the nations who are divided into believers and disbelievers, for the nations before the coming of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) were of two types, kafir nations all of whose people were doomed and among whom were none who were blessed, such as the idol-worshippers and the Magians; and others who were divided into those who were blessed and those who were doomed, namely the Jews, Christians and Sabians. Allah has mentioned the two types in His Book, where He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, those who believe and those who are Jews and Christians, and Sabians [wa’l-sabi-in ], whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and does righteous good deeds shall have their reward with their Lord, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.” [al-Baqarah 2:62]
And He says something similar in al-Maidah. And in Surat al-Hajj He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, those who believe (in Allah and in His Messenger Muhammad), and those who are Jews, and the Sabians [wa’l-sabi-in], and the Christians, and the Majus, and those who worship others besides Allah; truly, Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection. Verily, Allah is over all things a Witness.” [al-Hajj 22:17]
He did not say here: those among them who believed in Allah and the Last Day, because He mentioned alongside them the Magians and those who worship others besides Allah. So He mentioned six nations, among whom are two who are doomed and four who are divided into the doomed and the blessed. When He promised the reward to those who believed and did righteous deeds, he mentioned four nations and no more. In the verse which speaks of the judgement between the nations He included these two nations with them, and in the verse which speaks of the promised reward He did not include them. Thus it is known that the Sabians included both believers and disbelievers, both doomed and blessed. 
This is an ancient nation which existed before the Jews and Christians and they were of different types: Sabians who were hanifs (monotheists) and Sabians who were mushrikun (polytheists). Their kingdom was in Haran, before the time of the Messiah. They wrote books and had knowledge. There were many of them in Baghdad, including Ibrahim ibn Hilal al-Sabi, the author of al-Rasail. He followed their religion but he fasted Ramadan with the Muslims. Most of them were philosophers and wrote famous essays which were mentioned by the scholars who wrote about philosophy and religion. 
In brief, they did not reject the Prophets or regard it as obligatory to follow them. In their view, whoever followed (the Prophets) is blessed and saved, and whoever follows a path similar to that of the Prophets by virtue of his own reasoning is also blessed and saved, even if he did not follow the Prophets in specific terms. In their view the call of the Prophets was true but there was no one specific route to salvation. They believed that the universe had a Creator and Sustainer, Who is Wise and above any resemblance to created beings, but many of them, or most of them, said: we are unable to reach Him without intermediaries, so we have to approach Him through the mediation of spiritual and holy who are pure and free of any physical elements and who are above place and time, rather they are created pure and holy.  
Then he mentioned that they used to worship these intermediaries and seek to draw close to them, and they said, “These are our gods and intercessors with the Lord of lords and God of gods.” 
Then he said: This is some of what was narrated by the scholar who studied religion and philosophy about the religion of the Sabians, and is based on what had come down to them. But among this nation are some who believe in Allah and His names and attributes, His angels and Messengers and the Last Day; and among them are disbelievers. There are some who took from the religion of the Messengers whatever suited their own reasoning and ideas of what is good, so they followed it and were content with it. 
Basically, they took what they thought was good from other religions, and they did not take the people of one religion as friends and others as enemies; they did not favour one religion over another. In their view all religions served some purpose in this world, so there was no sense in their fighting one another, rather the good things in each were to be adopted so as to perfect the human condition. Hence they were called sabi-in  because they refrained from following any one particular religion. Hence more than one of the salaf said: They are not Jews or Christians or Magians. 
There are two types of Sabians: the monotheistic Sabians (sabiah hunafa’) and polytheistic Sabians (sabiah mushrikun). The monotheists are the ones who are saved and there were debates among them, and one group refuted the view of the other. These are the people of Ibrahim as the Jews were the people of Musa, and the monotheists among them were his followers.” (Ahkam Ahl al-Dhimmah, 1/92-98)
What he mentioned about the Sabians being divided into monotheists and polytheists was confirmed by Shaykh al-Islam in more than one place. See al-Radd ‘ala al-Mantiqiyyin, 287-454; 290-458; Minhaj al-Sunnah, 1/5. See also the discussion by Shaykh Ibn ‘Ashur on this issue, in his commentary on the verse from al-Baqarah.

49050,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/49050,He is asking about the place for Eid prayer,"We heard that at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), the Eid prayer was held in a musalla (prayer-place) outside the built-up area, because his mosque could not accommodate all the people, and that if there is a mosque that can accommodate the people, then it is better for them to pray there because the mosque is better than anywhere else. Is this correct?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The practical Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) (i.e., what he did) was to leave his mosque for the Eid prayers and perform these prayers in the musalla that was at the outer gate of Madeenah. See Zaad al-Ma’aad by Ibn al-Qayyim, 1/441. 
Shaykh Ahmad Shaakir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The views of the scholars concerning that are closely connected: 
In Sharh al-Bukhaari, the Hanafi scholar al-‘Ayni discussed the following hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed [al-Khudri]: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to go out to the prayer-place on the day of al-Fitr and al-Adha. The first thing that he did was to pray, then he would move away and stand facing the people, when the people were (still) sitting in their rows, and he would exhort them and advise them and issue commands to them. If he wanted to dispatch an army he would do so, and if he wanted to issue some command, he would do so. Then he would leave.” Abu Sa’eed said: The people continued to do that until I came out with Marwaan when he was the governor of Madeenah, on (the day of) al-Ahda or al-Fitr. When we came to the prayer place, there was the minbar that had been built by Katheer ibn al-Salt.  Marwaan wanted to ascend the minbar; I grabbed his clothes but he pulled away, and he ascended and delivered the khutbah before the prayer. I said to him: “You have changed it, by Allah.” He said: “O Abu Sa’eed, gone is that which you know.” I said: “By Allah, what I know is better than that which I do not know.” He said: “The people will not sit and listen to us after the prayer so I did it before the prayer.” 
Narrated by al-Bukhari, 956; Muslim, 889.  
Al-‘Ayni said: This shows that we should go out to the prayer-place and not offer the Eid prayer in the mosque except in case of necessity. Ibn Ziyaad narrated that Maalik said: The Sunnah is to go out to the prayer-place except for the people of Makkah, who should pray in the mosque.
In al-Fataawa al-Hindiyyah (vol. 1, p. 118) it says: Going out to the prayer-place for Eid prayer is Sunnah, even if the Jaami’ Mosque is large enough to accommodate them. This is the view of the majority of shaykhs and it is the correct view. 
In al-Mudawwanah al-Marwiyah ‘an Maalik (vol. 1, p. 171), Maalik said: The Eid prayer should not be offered in two places, and they should not pray in their mosques, rather they should all go out as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went out. And Ibn Wahb narrated from Yoonus that Ibn Shihaab said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to go out to the prayer-place, then the people of the regions followed that Sunnah. 
Ibn Qudaamah al-Hanbali said in al-Mughni (vol. 2, no. 229-230): The Sunnah is to offer the Eid prayer in the prayer-place. This was enjoined by ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) and was regarded as good by al-Awzaa’i and Ashaab al-Ra’i. This is also the view of Ibn al-Mundhir. 
It was narrated from al-Shaafa’i that if the mosque of a city is spacious, then it is better to pray there, because it is the best and purest place. Hence the people of Makkah pray (Eid) in al-Masjid al-Haraam. 
Then Ibn Qudamah quoted evidence to support his view, and said: Our evidence shows that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to go out to the prayer-place and leave his mosque, as did the caliphs after him. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would not forsake the better thing even though it was closer and take the trouble to go to an imperfect place that was further away, and he did not prescribe for his ummah that they should forsake that which is good and virtuous. We have been commanded to follow the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and take him as our example. It cannot be the case that the thing that is enjoined is imperfect and the thing that is forbidden is perfect. There is no report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) offered the Eid prayer in his mosque except when there was a reason or excuse. This is also the consensus of the Muslims. The people in all ages and in all places have gone out to the prayer-place and offered the Eid prayer there, regardless of whether the mosque is spacious or otherwise. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to offer the Eid prayer in the prayer-place even though his mosque is such a venerable place. 
And I – Ahmad Shaakir is speaking – say that words of Ibn Qudaamah, “There is no report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) offered the Eid prayer in his mosque except when there was a reason or excuse”, is a reference to the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah which is narrated by al-Haakim in al-Mustadrak (vol. 1, p. 295): “Rain fell on the day of Eid, so the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed in the mosque.” This was classed as saheeh by him (al-Haakim) and al-Dhahabi. [And Ibn al-Qayyim said of it: If the hadeeth is proven, it is also narrated in Sunan Abi Dawood and Ibn Maajah. Zaad al-Ma’aad, 1/441. But it was classed as da’eef by al-Albaani in Risaalat Salaat al-Eidayn fi’l-Musalla hiya al-Sunnah, and he narrated the view of al-Haakim and al-Dhahabi]. 
Imam al-Shaafa’i said in al-Umm (vol. 1, p. 207): “We have heard that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to go out on the two Eids to the prayer-place in Madeenah, as did those who came after him, and most of the people in all countries, except Makkah (concerning which) we have not heard that any of the salaf led them in offering the Eid prayer except in their mosque. I think that this – and Allah knows best – is because al-Masjid al-Haraam is the best spot on earth, so they did not like to pray anywhere else if possible. 
“If there is a town and the mosque of its people is big enough to accommodate them, I do not think that they should go out of it, but if they do go out, there is nothing wrong with that. If it is big enough and their imam leads them in prayer there, I regard that as makrooh but they do not have to repeat it. If there is an excuse such as rain etc, I would tell them to pray in the mosque and not go out to the desert.” 
The scholar Ibn al-Haaj said in al-Madkhal (vol. 2, 283): The proven Sunnah with regard to the Eid prayer is that it should be offered in the prayer-place, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “A prayer offered in this mosque of mine is better than a thousand prayers offered elsewhere, except in al-Masjid al-Haraam.” (al-Bukhari, 1190; Muslim, 1394). Then despite that great virtue he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went out to the prayer-place and left the mosque. This clearly indicates that the command to go out to the prayer-place for Eid prayer is confirmed, so this is the Sunnah. According to the madhhab of Maalik (may Allah have mercy on him), offering the Eid prayer in the mosque is bid’ah (an innovation), unless there is some reason why it is necessary to do that, in which case it is not bid’ah, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not do it and neither did any of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs after him. And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded the women to come out to the Eid prayer, and he told the menstruating women and women in seclusion to come out. One of them said, O Messenger of Allah, one of us does not have a jilbaab.” He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Let her sister lends her a jilbaab so that she may witness goodness and attend the gathering of the Muslims.” (See Saheeh al-Bukhari, 324; Saheeh Muslim, 890). 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded the women to go out and he prescribed the prayer out in the open so that the symbols of Islam might be manifested.
The Prophet’s Sunnah that is narrated in the saheeh hadeeths indicates that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to offer the Eid prayer in the desert outside the city. This is how it continued during the early days of Islam, and they did not offer the Eid prayer inside the city unless there was a reason that made it necessary to do so, such as rain. 
This is the view of the four imams and other scholars and imams – may Allah be pleased with them all. I do not know of anyone who held a different opinion, apart from the view of al-Shaafa’i (may Allah have mercy on him) who preferred that the prayer be offered in the mosque if it was big enough to hold all the people of the city. Despite that he did not see anything wrong with praying in the desert even if the mosque was big enough. And he clearly stated that he regarded it as makrooh to offer the Eid prayer in the mosque if it was not big enough to hold all the people. 
These saheeh ahaadeeth and others, and the fact that this is how they continued to do it during the early days of Islam, and the views of the scholars, all indicate that offering the Eid prayers in the mosques now is a bid’ah (innovation), even according to the view of al-Shaafa’i, because there is no one mosque in our cities that can accommodate all the people of the city where it is located. 
Moreover, this is the Sunnah, to gather all the people of the city, men, women and children, so that their hearts may turn to Allah as one and they may be united, praying behind one imam, saying “Allahu akbar” and “Laa ilaaha ill-Allah”, praying to Allah with sincerity, as if they are one, rejoicing in the blessing that Allah has bestowed upon them, so that the Eid will be a true Eid.  
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded the women to go out to the Eid prayer with the people, and he did not exclude anyone from that. He did not even excuse those who had nothing to wear from going out, rather he commanded them to borrow something from someone else. He even commanded those who had an excuse for not praying to go out to the prayer-place, “to witness goodness and attend the gathering of the Muslims.” 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the caliphs after him, and the governors whom they appointed in the various cities, used to led the people in offering the Eid prayer, then they would address them, exhorting them and teaching them things that would benefit them in their religious and worldly concerns. They would command them to give in charity in that blessed gathering, upon which descended divine mercy and blessing. 
May the Muslims follow the Sunnah of their Prophet and revive the symbols of their religion, which is the source of their pride and success.
