1.	Believing that collecting pebbles from other than Muzdalifah renders stoning invalid.
2.	Washing the pebbles before using them, either for fear that someone may have urinated on them, or because believing that it is better to clean them.
3.	Some people believe that they are actually stoning the devil himself.

Mistakes made when stoning the Jamarat","Praise be to Allah.Why was stoning the Jamarat prescribed?
It was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that he stoned Jamarat Al-`Aqabah which is Al-Jamarah Al-Quswa which is closer to Makkah, with seven pebbles, during the morning of the Day of Sacrifice, saying “Allahu akbar” with every pebble which was a little bigger than a chickpea.  
Ibn Majah (3029) narrated that Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to me on the morning of Al-`Aqabah when he was standing atop his camel: “Come and pick up for me.” So I picked up pebbles for him which were a little bigger than a chickpea. He put them in his hand and said, “With pebbles like this stone (the Jamarat)… and beware of going to extremes, for those who came before you were destroyed because of going to extremes in religion.” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah, 2455) 
Ahmad and Abu Dawud narrated from `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Tawaf around the House, [Sa`i] between As-Safa and Al-Marwah and stoning the Jamarat have been prescribed to establish the remembrance of Allah.” This is the reason why the stoning of the Jamarat has been prescribed . 
Mistakes made when stoning the Jamarat
There are many mistakes committed by some pilgrims when stoning the Jamarat . 

Some people think that the stoning of the Jamarat is not valid unless it is done with pebbles from Muzdalifah . Hence you will find them going to a lot of trouble to gather the pebbles from Muzdalifah before they go to Mina. This is a mistaken idea, because the pebbles may be taken from anywhere, from Muzdalifah, from Mina, or from any place. The point is that they should be pebbles. 

There is no report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) picked up the pebbles from Muzdalifah, so that we could say that this is Sunnah. It is not Sunnah, and it is not obligatory to pick up the pebbles from Muzdalifah, because the Sunnah is either the words or actions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), or what he approved of – none of which apply in the case of picking up pebbles from Muzdalifah. 

Some people, when they pick up the pebbles, wash them, either for fear that someone may have urinated on them, or to clean them, because they think that if they are clean, this is better. Whatever the case, washing the pebbles is an innovation (Bid’ah), because the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not do that, and worshipping Allah by doing something that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not do is a kind of bid’ah. If a person does that without the intention of it being an act of worship then it is foolishness and is a waste of time. 


Some people think that these Jamarat are devils, and that they are actually stoning devils, so you may see them becoming very emotional and very angry, as if the Shaytan himself is in front of him, and this leads to the following grave errors: 


This is a mistaken notion. We stone these Jamarat as an act of remembering Allah, following the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), as an act of worship. If a person does an act of worship and does not know its benefits, but he does it only as an act of worship for Allah, this will be more indicative of his humility and submission to Allah.
A person may become very angry and emotional, so you see him disturbing people greatly, as if the people in front of him are vermin and he doesn’t care about them or the weak among them, he just goes forward like a crazy camel.
A person may not remember that he is worshipping Allah by stoning these Jamarat. Hence he neglects to say the dhikr prescribed in sharee’ah and says words that are not prescribed in shari`ah, such as saying, “O Allah, we are angry with the Shaytan and are pleased with Al-Rahman (the Most Merciful),” even though this is not prescribed when stoning the Jamarat ; rather what is prescribed is to say “Allahu Akbar,” as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to do.
Based on this false belief you will see some people picking up large rocks and throwing them, because they think that the bigger the rock, the greater the effect and revenge on the Shaytan. You also see them throwing shoes, pieces of wood and the like, which are not prescribed for throwing.

So if we say that this belief is false, what do we then believe about stoning the Jamarat? We believe that we stone the Jamarat as an act of veneration and worship of Allah, and following the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 

Some people are careless and do not care whether the pebbles land in the pit around the Jamarat or not . 

If the pebbles do not land in the pit around the Jamarat, then the stoning is not valid. It is sufficient for the person to think it most likely that the pebbles have landed in the pit around the Jamarat, and it is not essential to be certain, because certainty in this case may not be possible; if one cannot be certain that he should act on what he thinks is most likely. Islam allows a person to proceed on the basis of what he thinks is most likely, if he is uncertain as to how many rak’ahs he has prayed, three or four, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Let him decide what is most likely the case, then complete it on that basis.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 1020) 
This proves that in matters of worship it is sufficient to base one’s actions on what he thinks is most likely the case. This is because Allah wants to make things easy because it may not be possible to be certain. 
If the pebbles land in the pit around the Jamarat, then the duty has been discharged, whether they stay in the pit or roll out of it. 

Some people think that the pebbles must hit the pillar in the pit. This is a mistaken notion, because it is not essential for the stoning to be valid that the pebbles should hit this pillar. This pillar is only there as a marker for the pit in which the pebbles land. If the pebbles land in the pit that is sufficient, whether they hit the pillars or not. 


One of the most serious mistakes that are made is when some people take the matter of stoning the Jamarat lightly, and delegate someone else to do it on their behalf even though they are able to do it. This is a serious mistake, because stoning the Jamarat is one of the rituals of Hajj. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“And perform properly (i.e. all the ceremonies according to the ways of Prophet Muhammad), the Hajj and `Umrah (i.e. the pilgrimage to Makkah) for Allah.” [Al-Baqarah 2:196]
This means completing Hajj with all its rituals in full. So each person must do them himself, and not delegate someone else to do it on his behalf. 
Some people say, “The place is too crowded and it is too difficult for me.” We say to them, “If the crowding is too bad when the people first come to Mina from Muzdalifah it will not be so bad at the end of the day, or at night. If you do not manage to stone the Jamarat during the day, then you can do it at night, because night is also the time for stoning, although the day is preferable. But it is better for a person to come and do the stoning at night in a calm, dignified and humble manner than to come during the day fearing that he may die because of the overcrowding, and he may throw his pebbles and they may not land in the pit. The point is if someone uses the overcrowding as an excuse, we say to him: Allah has given plenty of room for manoeuvre, so you can stone the Jamarat at night. 
Similarly if a woman is afraid of something if she stones the Jamarat with the people, she can delay it until the night. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not allow the weak ones among his family – such as Sawdah bint Zam’ah (may Allah be pleased with her) and those like her – to forego stoning the Jamarat and to delegate someone else to do it on their behalf; rather he gave them permission to leave Muzdalifah at the end of the night, to stone the Jamarat before the place became crowded. This is the greatest evidence that a woman should not delegate this task just because she is a woman. 
Yes, if a person is disabled and unable to stone the Jamarat by himself, either during the day or at night, then in this case it is permissible for him to delegate it to someone else , because he is incapable of doing it. It was narrated from the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) that they used to stone the Jamarat on behalf of their children, because the children were unable to do it. 
Whatever the case, being careless with regard to this matter – i.e., delegating the stoning of the Jamarat, except for those who have excuses which mean that they are unable to do it – is a serious mistake, because it is carelessness with regard to an act of worship, and negligence with regard to a duty.

    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “All of my ummah may be forgiven except those who commit sin openly.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari 
    (6069) and Muslim (2990). This hadeeth contains a stern warning to those who commit evil openly and broadcast it and spread it and do it 
    blatantly. This person who commits sin openly feels no shame before Allaah or His creation, so he must be denounced and admonished.

34464,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34464,Visiting the Prophet’s Mosque,"If the pilgrim performing Hajj or ‘Umrah wants to visit the Prophet’s Mosque, should he form the intention of visiting the mosque or of visiting the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)? And what is the etiquette of visiting the Prophet’s Mosque?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
“If the pilgrim wants to visit the Prophet’s Mosque before or after Hajj, he should have the intention of visiting the mosque, not the grave, because travelling to a place for the purpose of worship does not include visiting graves, rather it includes only the three mosques: al-Masjid al-Haraam (the Sacred Mosque in Makkah), al-Masjid al-Nabawi (the Prophet’s Mosque in Madeenah) and al-Masjid al-Aqsa (in Jerusalem), as it says in the hadeeth which was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) who said: “No journey should be undertaken to any mosque except three: al-Masjid al-Haraam, this mosque of mine and al-Masjid al-Aqsa.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1189: Muslim, 1397. 
When he reaches the Prophet’s Mosque, he should enter with his right foot first and say, “Bismillaah wa’l-salaatu wa’l-salaam ‘ala Rasoolillaah. Allaahumma ighfir li dhunoobi waftah li abwaab rahmatika. A’oodhu Billaah il-‘azeem wa bi wajhihi’l-kareem wa bi sultaanihi’l-qadeem min al-shaytaan il-rajeem (In the name of Allaah, and peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allaah. O Allaah, forgive my sins and open to me the gates of Your mercy. I seek refuge in Allaah the Almighty and in His noble Face and in His eternal Power, from the accursed Shaytaan).” Then he should pray as he likes. 
It is better for him to pray in al-Rawdah which is the area between the minbar of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the room in which is his grave, because this area is one of the gardens (riyaadh, sing. rawdah) of Paradise. When he has prayed and wants to visit the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), he should stand in front of it in a dignified manner and say, “Assalaamu ‘alayka ayyuha’l-Nabiyyu wa rahmat-Allaahi wa barakaatuhu. Allaahumma salli ‘ala Muhammad wa ‘ala aali Muhammad kama salayta ‘ala Ibraaheem wa ‘ala aali Ibraaheem, innaka hameedun majeed; Allaahumma baarik ‘ala Muhammad wa ‘ala aali Muhammad  kama baarakta ‘ala Ibraaheem wa ‘ala aali Ibraaheem, innaka hameedun majeed. Ashhadu annaka Rasool-Allaah haqqan wa annaka qad balaghta al-risaalah wa adayta al-amaanah wa nasahta al-ummah wa jaahadta fillaahi haqqa jihaadihi. Fa jazaka Allaahu ‘an ummatika afdal ma jaza nabiyyan ‘an ummatihi (Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and the mercy of Allaah, and His blessings. O Allaah, send prayers upon Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad, as You sent prayers upon Ibraaheem and the family of Ibraaheem, verily You are Worthy of Praise, Full of Glory. O Allaah, send blessings upon Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad, as You sent blessings upon Ibraaheem and the family of Ibraaheem, verily You are Worthy of Praise, Full of Glory. I bear witness that you are indeed the Messenger of Allaah, that you conveyed the message and fulfilled the trust, and advised the ummah and strove truly for the sake of Allaah. May Allaah reward you on behalf of your ummah better than any Prophet is rewarded on behalf of his nation).” 
Then he should move a little to his right and send salaams upon Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq and pray that Allaah be pleased with him. 
Then he should move a little further to his right and send salaams upon ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab and pray that Allaah be pleased with him. If he makes du’aa’ for Abu Bakr and ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with them) in an appropriate manner, that is good. 
It is not permissible for anyone to seek to draw closer to Allaah by touching the hujrah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or by circumambulating it, or by facing it whilst making du’aa’. Rather he should turn to face the qiblah, because drawing closer to Allaah can only be done by means of that which Allaah and His Messenger have prescribed. Acts of worship are based on following not on innovation. 
Women should not visit the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or any other grave, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed women who visit graves. Narrated by al-Tirmidhi and classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 843. Rather a woman should pray and send blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in the place where she is, and that will reach the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) no matter where she is. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Send blessings upon me, for your blessings will reach me no matter where you are.” And he said, “Allaah has angels who travel about throughout the land, conveying to me the salaams of my ummah.” Narrated by al-Nasaa’i, 1282; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Nasaa’i, 1215. 
Only men should visit al-Baqee’, which is the graveyard of Madeenah. They should say: “Al-salaamu ‘alaykum ahl al-diyaar min al-mu’mineen wa’l-muslimeen, wa innaa in sha Allaah bikum laahiqoon. Yarham Allaah al-mustaqdimeena mina wa minkum wa’l-musta’khireen. Nas’al Allaah lana wa lakum al-‘aafiyah. Allaahumma la tahrimna ajrahum wa la taftinna ba’dahum waghfir lana wa lahum (Peace be upon you, O dwellers of these abodes, believers and Muslims. We will, when Allaah wills, join you. May Allaah have mercy on those who were first (to die) and those who were last. We ask Allaah to grant salvation to us and you. O Allaah, deprive us not of reward (similar to theirs) and lead us not astray after they are gone; forgive us and them).” 
If he then wants to go to Mount Uhud and remember what happened there to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his companions in that battle of jihad, trials and martyrdom, and send salaams upon the shuhada’ (martyrs) there, such as Hamzah ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib, the paternal uncle of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), there is nothing wrong with that, because that is a kind of travelling through the land as enjoined (in Islam) [cf. al-Nahl 16:36].

34489,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34489,Ruling on reading erotic stories with one’s spouse,"It is permissible to read erotic stories with one's spouse, with the aim of increasing one’s pleasure?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Reading erotic stories, even if that is only with one's spouse, involves many evils including the  following: 
1 – These stories are acquired either by purchasing them or borrowing them. That is not permitted because it encourages those who print them, publish them and distribute them. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “but do not help one another in sin and transgression” [al-Maa'idah 5:2]. 
2 – These stories are only written by immoral and promiscuous people. Most of those who write them are kuffaar who pay no attention to religion, morals or manners in what they write. Reading them is a means to propagate their deviant ways and bad customs among the people, whether they realize it or not. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The likeness of a good companion and a bad one is that of the one who carries musk and the one who works the bellows. As for the one who carries musk, either he will give you some or you will buy some from him, or you will notice a nice smell from him. And as for the one who works the bellows, either he will burn your clothes or you will notice an unpleasant smell from him.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5534; Muslim, 2628. 
Al-Haafiz said: This hadeeth indicates that it is forbidden to sit with those whose company will harm your religious or worldly interests. Fath al-Baari, 4/410. 
3 – These stories contain lies and exaggerations, and describe imaginary events which affect the reader in negative ways and make each partner less content with the other. 
4 – There is no guarantee that these stories will not fall into the hands of children whose morals will be corrupted and they will be led astray or they will think badly of their parents. The parents may not be aware of that, but they will bear the burden of their children’s sin when regret will be of no avail. 
For these reasons and others it is not permissible to read these stories at all. There is sufficient in what is permissible so that we have no need of that which is haraam; what Allah has permitted gives sufficient pleasure which Allah is pleased with and by means of which the individual and the society are protected from the spread of evil and immorality.

Please note that my classmates do not share my doubts and they eat it. Are they doing the right thing or are they eating haraam food? 

Similarly with regard to the vessels used, no distinction is made between vessels for Muslims and other vessels. What should I do concerning that?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to eat meat slaughtered 
    by kaafirs, apart from the People of the Book, i.e., Jews and Christians, whether the kaafirs in question are Magians, idolaters, communists or 
    any other kind of kaafirs. It is also not permissible to eat anything that has been mixed with their meat, such as soups, sauces, etc. Allaah has 
    not permitted us to eat the food of the kuffaar apart from the food of the People of the Book, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Made lawful to you this day are 
    At-Tayyibaat [all kinds of Halaal (lawful) foods, which Allaah has made lawful (meat of slaughtered eatable animals, milk products, fats, 
    vegetables and fruits)]. The food (slaughtered cattle, eatable animals) of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) is lawful to you and 
    yours is lawful to them”

“Their food” means the meat that they slaughter, as mentioned by Ibn ‘Abbaas and others. 
With regard to fruits and the like, there is nothing wrong with eating them, because they are 
    not included among the foods that are haraam. As for the food of the Muslims, it is permissible for them and for others, if they are true Muslims 
    who worship none but Allaah and do not call upon anyone besides Him such as Prophets, awliya’ (“saints”), occupants of graves and others who are 
    worshipped by the kuffaar. 
With regard to vessels, the Muslims should 
    have vessels separate from those of the kuffaar which the latter use for their food, wine, etc. If none are available then the Muslim cooks should 
    wash the vessels that the kuffaar use and then put the Muslims’ food in them, because of the report narrated in al-Saheehayn from Abu 
    Tha’labah al-Khushani (may Allaah be pleased with him), that he asked the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about eating

34497,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34497,"Ruling on standing up for who comes in, and kissing him","What is the ruling on standing up for who comes in, and kissing him?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
With regard to standing up for who comes in, Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah gave a detailed answer to this question, 
    based on shar’i evidence, which we think should be quoted because it serves the purpose. He said: 
It was not the custom of the salaf at the 
    time of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the Rightly-Guided Caliphs to stand up every time they saw him [the 
    Prophet]  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), as many people do. Rather Anas ibn Maalik said: “No person was dearer to them than the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), but when they saw him they did not stand up for him because they knew that he disliked 
    that.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2754; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. But they may have stood up for one who was 
    returning from away, in order to greet him, as it was narrated that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stood up for 
    ‘Ikrimah, and he said to the Ansaar when Sa’d ibn Mu’aadh came: “Stand up for your chief.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3043; Muslim, 1768.  That was 
    when he [Sa’d] came to pass judgement on Banu Qurayzah, because they said that would accept his verdict. 
What people should do is get accustomed to 
    following the salaf in their customs at the time of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), for they are the 
    best of generations and the best of speech is the Word of Allaah, and the best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him). No one should turn away from the guidance of the best of mankind and the guidance of the best of generations and follow 
    something that is inferior to it. And the chief or leader should not approve of that among his companions, so that when they see him they should 
    not stand up for him, rather they should simply greet him in the usual manner.  
With regard to standing up for one who has 
    come from a journey and the like, to greet him, that is fine. If it is the custom of the people to honour one who comes by standing up for him, 
    and if that may make him feel insulted if they do not do it, and he does not know the custom that is in accordance with the Sunnah, then it is 
    better to stand up for him, because that will create a good relationship between them and will remove rancour and hatred. But if a person is 
    familiar with the custom of some people that is in accordance with the Sunnah, not doing that will not offend him.   
Standing up for a newcomer is not the 
    standing mentioned in the words of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Whoever likes the people to stand up for him, 
    let him take his place in Hell.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2755; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi.  That refers to when 
    they stand up for him when he is seated; it does not refer to when they stand up to welcome him when he comes. Hence the scholars differentiated 
    between the two types of standing, because those who stand up to greet a newcomer are equal with him, unlike those who stand for one who remains 
    seated. 
It was proven in Saheeh Muslim that 
    when the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) led them in prayer sitting down, because he was ill, and they prayed standing, 
    he told them to sit down and said: “Do not venerate me as the Persians venerate one another.” And he forbade them to stand in prayer whilst he was 
    sitting, lest they resemble the Persians who used to stand for their leaders whilst the leaders were seated. In conclusion, the best is to follow 
    the customs and attitude and views of the salaf as much as possible.  
If a person does not believe in that and is 
    not familiar with this custom, and if not dealing with him in the manner in which people are accustomed to showing respect will lead to a greater 
    evil, then we should ward off the greater of two evils by doing the lesser of them, and do that which serves a greater interest at the expense 
    that which serves the lesser interest.  
End quote from Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah. 
What will make this clearer is the report 
    narrated in al-Saheehayn concerning the story of Ka’b ibn Maalik, when Allaah accepted his repentance and that of his two companions (may 
    Allaah be pleased with them all), in which it says that when Ka’b entered the mosque, Talhah ibn ‘Ubayd-Allaah stood up, ran to him and greeted 
    him, and congratulated him on Allaah’s forgiveness, and the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not denounce that. This 
    indicates that it is permissible to stand up for someone who comes in, and to shake his hand and greet him. Similar to this is the report that 
    when the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) entered upon his daughter Faatimah, she would stand up for him and take his 
    hand, and make him sit in her place. And when she entered upon him, he would take her hand and make her sit in his place. Classed as saheeh by 
    al-Tirmidhi. 
Secondly: 
With regard to kissing, there is evidence narrated from the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) which indicates that this is allowed in sharee’ah. It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: Zayd ibn Haarithah 
    came to Madeenah and the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was in my house. He came to him and knocked at the 
    door, and the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stood up (to open the door) for him wearing nothing but an 
    izaar (waist wrapper) dragging his garment, and by Allaah I never saw him wearing nothing but an izaar before or after that. And he embraced him 
    and kissed him. Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, who said: a hasan hadeeth. 
This hadeeth indicates that it is allowed to 
    do that with one who comes. But this hadeeth was classed as da’eef by al-Albaani in Da’eef al-Tirmidhi, 2732. 
It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah 
    be pleased with him) said: The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) kissed al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali. Al-Aqra’ ibn Haabis said: “I 
    have ten children and I have never kissed any of them.” The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “He will not be shown 
    mercy who does not show mercy (to others).” Agreed upon. 
This hadeeth indicates that kissing is 
    prescribed if it is done out of mercy and compassion. With regard to kissing when meeting someone in a the regular manner, there is evidence that 
    indicates that this is not prescribed, and that it is sufficient to shake hands. It was narrated that Qataadah (may Allaah be pleased with him) 
    said: I said to Anas, “Did the companions of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) shake hands?” He said, 
    “Yes.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari. 
And it was narrated from Anas that when the 
    people of Yemen came, the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The people of Yemen have come, and they are 
    the first who came shaking hands.” Narrated by Abu Dawood with a saheeh isnaad. 
It was narrated that al-Bara’ (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There are no two Muslims who meet and 
    shake hands, but they will be forgiven before they part.” Narrated by Abu Dawood and Ahmad; narrated and classed as saheeh by al-Tirmidhi; also 
    classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 5212. 
It was narrated that Anas (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) said: A man said, “O Messenger of Allaah, when a man among us meets his brother and friend, should he bow to him?” He said, 
    “No.” He said, “Should he embrace him and kiss him?” He said, “No.” He said, “Should he take his hand and shake hands?” He said, “Yes.” Narrated 
    by al-Tirmidhi, who said: a hasan hadeeth; but he also said that its isnaad is da’eef, because it includes Hanzalah al-Sadoosi, who is da’eef 
    according to the scholars. But perhaps al-Tirmidhi classed it as hasan because there are other ahaadeeth which support it. It was also classed as 
    hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 2728.  
Ahmad, al-Nasaa’i, al-Tirmidhi and others 
    narrated with their saheeh isnaads, and al-Tirmidhi classed it as saheeh, from Safwaan ibn ‘Assaal that two Jews asked the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) about the nine clear signs (given to Moosa), and when he answered their question, they kissed his hands and feet 
    and said, “We bear witness that you are a Prophet.” 
Al-Tabaraani narrated with a jayyid isnaad 
    from Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) that he said: When the companions of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) met, 
    they would shake hands, and when they came from a journey they would embrace one another.” This was mentioned by Ibn Muflih in al-Adaab 
    al-Shar’iyyah. 
And Allaah is the Source of strength. May 
    Allaah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.
