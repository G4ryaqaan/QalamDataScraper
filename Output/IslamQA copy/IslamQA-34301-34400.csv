34306,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34306,I want to be a devoted slave of Allaah … ten pointers,"My question is short. I want to enter Paradise, I want to strive to control my self (my nafs), I want to kiss my mother’s hand every day, I want to keep away from whims and desires and from the Shaytaan, I want Allaah to call me a devoted slave on the Day of Resurrection, in sha Allaah, I want to love my brothers, and I want my faith to keep increasing. What should I do?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.We ask Allaah to make you steadfast in 
    adhering to the truth, and to make your hopes come true, and to make you one of those who turn to Him and who know the truth, defend it and adhere 
    to Islam. 
The things you mention in your question 
    indicate that you have a sound and pure nature, and a great desire to achieve great things and to give everyone his rights. These are great hopes 
    that can be achieved through faith, as it was narrated that Sufyaan al-Thawri said: Faith is not wishes or pretence, rather it is what settles in 
    the heart and is proven by actions.” So we will discuss the matter of faith and how important it is in becoming a devoted slave, pleasing and 
    honouring one’s parents and achieving the victory of Paradise. 
Whoever seeks to achieve great things has to 
    stay up at night (worship).  
Hence al-Fudayl said: “You hearts can never 
    taste the sweetness of faith until they shun worldly pleasures.” And he also said, “If you cannot pray qiyaam at night and fast during the day, 
    then know that you are deprived.” 
The sincere believer has a heart like a 
    burning coal, hence it was narrated by al-Haakim in his Mustadrak and al-Tabaraani in his Mu’jam with a saheeh isnaad that the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Faith wears out in your heart as clothes wear out, so ask Allaah to renew the 
    faith in your hearts.” 
The believer’s heart may sometimes feel 
    overwhelmed by clouds of sin. This was portrayed to us by the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when he said: “There is no 
    heart that does not have clouds like the clouds that cover the moon. When the cloud covers it, it is dark, and when the cloud moves away it 
    shines.” Narrated by al-Tabaraani in al-Awsat, and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani. So the believer’s heart is sometimes covered with a 
    cloud and its light is hidden, and it remains dark and lonely, but if he strives to increase his store of faith and seeks the help of Allaah, that 
    cloud goes away and the light in his heart starts to shine again. Hence one of the salaf said: “It is part of a person’s smartness to c heck on 
    his faith and be aware of what affects it.” It is also part of a person’s smartness “that he recognizes how the Shaytaan whispers to him.” 
So he has to come back to faith. If you come 
    back to faith and do as it requires, then you will achieve what you want. We will tell you of a basic principle which will let you know when faith 
    is present and when it is not. Imam Ibn al-Jawzi said: “O you who are turned away, O you who are deprived of meeting your loved ones, if you want 
    to know how you stand before the king, then look at how you are spending your time and what work you are assigned to do. How many people stand at 
    the door of the king, but no one enters except the one whom he cares for.  Not every heart is fit to draw close, not every heart can be filled 
    with love, not every wind is like the morning breeze.” 
If a person want to know how he stands before 
    Allaah and how he stands in relation to His commands and prohibitions, let him look at himself and see what he is preoccupied with. If he is busy 
    with da’wah and with saving people from the Fire, striving to attain Paradise, helping the weak and needy, honouring his parents, then let him 
    rejoice in the fact that he is close to the King of kings, for Allaah does not help anyone to do good except those whom He loves.
 But if he is has no interest in da’wah, 
    dislikes the daa’iyahs and does not do good things, if he is preoccupied with this world and its gains, and with gossip and asking too many 
    questions, whilst not doing much or following his whims and desires, let him know that he is far from Allaah and has been deprived of that which 
    will bring him closer to Paradise, because Allaah says in His holy Book (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Whoever desires the quick-passing 
    (transitory enjoyment of this world), We readily grant him what We will for whom We like. Then, afterwards, We have appointed for him Hell; he 
    will burn therein disgraced and rejected ( 
    far away from Allaah’s Mercy).
And whoever desires the Hereafter and strives for it, with the necessary effort due for it 
    (i.e. does righteous deeds of Allaah’s obedience) while he is a believer (in the Oneness of Allaah  
    Islamic Monotheism) — then such are the ones whose striving shall be appreciated, (thanked and rewarded by Allaah)”
[al-Isra’ 17:18-19]
My brother, if you want to have a high 
    position in all kinds of good deeds, to be a devoted slave of Allaah and to honour your parents, and you are seeking Paradise, then you have to do 
    the following: 
1 – You have to revive the faith in your 
    heart. Faith is what will bring the Muslim everything he seeks in this world and in the Hereafter. Faith is the key to all goodness and locks the 
    door to all evil. The means of reviving and strengthening faith in one’s heart are many and varied, including doing a lot of acts of worship and 
    righteous deeds.
 2 – You must turn to your Lord sincerely, as 
    it says in the report: “If My slave turns to me inwardly and outwardly, I will turn the hearts of My slaves to him with love and mercy.” 
Allaah has made worship the ultimate aim and 
    loftiest purpose of man: 
“And I (Allaah) created not the jinn and 
    mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone)”
[al-Dhaariyaat 51:56 – interpretation of 
    the meaning)]
3 – You should always set your sights on the 
    highest degrees, and make your goal in life to earn the pleasure of Allaah, and strive to attain the victory of Paradise, or to attain the highest 
    Firdaws. You should strive as hard as you can to achieve these lofty aims. 
4 – You should follow the example of 
    historical Muslim figures such as the Sahaabah, Taabi’een and righteous forebears (the salaf). 
5 – You should make the most of every minute, 
    every moment and every heartbeat to use it in such a way as to increase your faith. 
6 – You should try to keep company with 
    righteous people, because the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “A man will follow the religion of his 
    close friend, so let each one of you look at whom he befriends.” Narrated by Abu Dawood and al-Tirmidhi with a hasan isnaad. Good friends are one 
    of the best means of helping you to obey Allaah and to avoid sin and error. 
7 – Doing a lot of righteous deeds which will 
    bring you happiness in this world and in the Hereafter. 
8 – Praying qiyaam al-layl, making du’aa’ in 
    the time just before dawn. The feet of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to swell because of his 
    desire to be a thankful slave, even though Allaah had forgiven his previous and future sins. 
9 – Persisting in reading a portion of 
    Qur’aan daily, and other dhikr that helps you to think and ponder the meanings of the Qur’aan. 
10 – Striving to spread the word and make 
    da’wah for the sake of Allaah, and working for Islam as much as possible. 
If you want to reach the status of devoted 
    slave for which you long, then be as Allaah commanded His Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): 
“Say (O Muhammad): Verily, my Salaah 
    (prayer), my sacrifice, my living, and my dying are for Allaah, the Lord of the ‘Aalameen (mankind, jinn and all that exists)”
[al-An’aam 6:162]
Being a devoted slave of Allaah means 
    declaring one’s devotion and belonging to the Lord, which can only be achieved by applying this aayah, so that we are for Allaah, the Lord of the 
    Worlds, in all our affairs. 
Being a devoted slave of Allaah can only be 
    fully achieved in this manner; it can only be achieved by worshipping Allaah in the fullest sense of the word, which means making our living and 
    dying, and all our movements, for Him alone. So we only speak that which is pleasing to Allaah; we only do that which is pleasing to Allaah; we 
    focus our intention in these words and deeds only on Allaah. Worship should not be reduced to merely raising and lowering our heads at certain 
    times, or giving a few pennies every once in a while, or fasting a few days each year, or moving our lips to say a few words and dhikrs. 
Hence the deeds that lead to this status – of 
    being a devoted slave – are innumerable and may take many shapes in all aspects of our lives and the places where we live. This is by the bounty 
    of Allaah towards us and towards all people. 
Just look, in every place where you find 
    yourself and every moment that comes to you, for that which will please Him, and what you think He wants to see you doing, and do it. Then you 
    will be a devoted slave. 
Finally, we ask Allaah to accept righteous 
    deeds from us and from you, and to gather us and you in His mercy with the Prophets, siddeeqs, martyrs and righteous, and those are the best of companions.

34325,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34325,Buying gold through a site on the internet,There is a company selling gold via the internet. Is it permissible to buy from them or to bring them customers and receive payment for that?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.It is well known in Islam that when buying gold for currency, the exchange should take place in the same sitting where the transaction is agreed upon, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Gold for gold, silver for silver, like for like, same for same, hand to hand… If it is an exchange of one of these things for another, then sell as you like, so long as it is hand to hand.”  
Narrated by Muslim, 1578. 
I think that buying gold via the internet is not a transaction that is conducted hand to hand, because you are sending the money to them then they send that gold to you after a while. If that is the case, then buying and selling in this manner is haraam, and it is haraam for you to bring customers to this company, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“but do not help one another in sin and transgression” [al-Maa'idah 5:2]
But if the money and goods are exchanged immediately in one sitting, then it is permissible for you to tell people about them and to bring customers to this company, and to receive payment for that. 
We ask Allah to make our provision halal. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.",Islam Q&A
34358,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34358,Visiting martyrs’ graves,What is the ruling on visiting some of the graves of Madeenah such as al-Baqee’ and the martyrs of Uhud?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Visiting graves is Sunnah in all places, especially visiting al-Baqee’ where many of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) are buried, including Ameer al-Mu’mineen ‘Uthmaan ibn ‘Affaan (may Allaah be pleased with him). His grave is there and is well known. 
Similarly it is Sunnah to go out to Uhud and visit the graves of the martyrs there, including Hamzah ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib, the paternal uncle of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). One should also visit the Mosque of Quba’, going out with wudoo’ and praying two rak’ahs there, because there is great virtue in doing so. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “One prayer in the Mosque of Quba’ is like ‘Umrah.” Saheeh al-Targheeb, 1180. And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever purifies himself in his house, then comes to the Mosque of Quba’ and offers a prayer there, will have a reward like that of ‘Umrah.” Saheeh al-Targheeb, 1181. 
There is nothing to be visited in Madeenah apart from the following: the Mosque of the Prophet, the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), al-Baqee’, the martyrs of Uhud, and the Mosque of Quba’. There is no basis for visiting any other places such as the Seven Mosques and Masjid al-Ghamaamah, and going to them with the intention that this is an act of worship is bid’ah (an innovation), because that was not narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). No one should suggest that a particular time or place or action or action has a special virtue or is a means of drawing closer to Allaah without evidence from sharee’ah.",From Daleel al-Akhta’ allata yaqa’ fiha al-Haaj wa’l-Mu’tamir (Mistakes made by pilgrims performing Hajj and ‘Umrah) by Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him)
34359,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34359,Virtues of Hajj,What are the virtues of Hajj?,"Hajj and other righteous deeds are means of expiation of sins, if a person does them in the manner prescribed in the Shari’ah.",,"Praise be to Allah.Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “Whoever performs Hajj and does not utter obscenities or commit sin, will come back as on the day when his mother bore him.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1521; Muslim, 1350)
And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “From one ‘Umrah to the next is an expiation for whatever (sins) came between them, and for an accepted Hajj there is no reward but Paradise.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1773; Muslim, 1349)
Hajj and other righteous deeds are means of expiation of sins, if a person does them in the manner prescribed in the Shari’ah. 
The majority of scholars are of the view that righteous deeds only expiate for minor sins. With regard to major sins, it is essential to repent. They quote as evidence for this view the hadith narrated by Muslim from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The five daily prayers, from one Jumu’ah to the next and from one Ramadan to the next is expiation for whatever (sins) come in between them, so long as you avoid major sins.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1/209) 
Imam Ibn al-Mundhir (may Allah have mercy on him) and a group of scholars are of the view that an accepted Hajj expiates for all sins , because of the apparent meaning of the two hadiths quoted above.

What about the dead?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.When a person dies, the his time of reckoning has started, and Allah knows best about the details of this situation. There is no way for us to know anything about the details of that except through sound texts and reports from Allah or His Messenger. There is evidence that the dying person sees the Angel of Death and his helpers, and that when he dies he sees Munkar and Nakeer, and that they make him sit up and question him in the grave. 
For more information see question no. 843 and 14610. 
What we must do is to stop at what is indicated by the texts and believe in it. As for anything over and beyond that, we say that Allah knows best about it. 
With regard to the jinn, there is no evidence to suggest that the dead can see them. It seems that they are like humans and the dead cannot see them. 
Whatever the case, the Muslim should strive to seek that which will benefit him, and refrain from delving deeply into matters that will not bring him any benefits in his religious affairs. He should spend his time pondering that which will strengthen his faith and prepare him for the terrors which come after death.

34365,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34365,Isbaal and wearing tight clothes for men,"What is isbaal and what is the ruling on it? What is the shar’i definition of it, and how can we refute those who say, “I am not doing it to show off”? What is your opinion of those (men) who wear tight and see-though clothing so that they become a fitnah (source of temptation) to others?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Isbaal means making the clothes so long that they come beneath the ankle. The prohibition on isbaal is mentioned in the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Whatever part of the lower garment comes beneath the ankles is in the Fire.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5787. This warning does not apply to something that is makrooh or permissible, rather the warning of Hellfire usually comes to the one who does a haraam action. 
If a man says, “I am not doing it to show off,” he is praising himself and that is not acceptable. The hadeeth is general in meaning and includes everyone who lets his garment hang down, whether that is out of pride or otherwise. 
With regard to the one who lets his garment hang down out of pride, his punishment will be more severe. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Isbaal may apply to the izaar (lower garment), shirt and turban. Whoever lets any of them hang down out of pride, Allaah will not look at him on the Day of Resurrection.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 4085; al-Nasaa’i, 5334; with a saheeh isnaad. 
See also question no. 10534 and 762. 
With regard to wearing see-through clothing that shows the ‘awrah, this is haraam and is not permissible, because the one who does that is not considered to be covering his ‘awrah. 
The same applies to tight clothes which show the size and shape of the ‘awrah and are a cause of fitnah (temptation). We are living in an age where desires are easily provoked and there is a great deal of fitnah, so how can it be appropriate for the Muslim youth to make matters worse and expose themselves to the wrath of the Lord?",Islam Q&A
34380,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34380,Can Women Go to Hajj Without a Mahram?,"A woman says: I live in the Kingdom (of Saudi Arabia) because I work here. I went for Hajj last year, and there were with me two of my female colleagues, but there was no mahram with us. What is the ruling concerning that?",It is not permissible for a Muslim woman to travel to Hajj without a mahram. A mahram is a man whom she is forever forbidden to marry because of blood ties.,"Hajj without mahram


Why is it required to have a mahram?","Praise be to Allah.Hajj without mahram
Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This action – Hajj without a mahram – is haram because of the hadith of Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say, when he was delivering a sermon, “No woman should travel except with a mahram.” A man stood up and said, “O Messenger of Allah, my wife has set out for Hajj, and I have signed up for such-and-such a military campaign.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Go and do Hajj with your wife .” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3006; Muslim, 1341)
So it is not permissible for a woman to travel without a mahram . A mahram is a man whom she is forever forbidden to marry because of blood ties or for a permissible reason. This is also subject to the condition that he be an adult of sound mind. A minor child cannot be a mahram, and neither can one who is not of sound mind. 
Why is it required to have a mahram? 
The reason for a mahram’s presence being required is so that he can look after her and protect her, so that she will not be bothered by those who do not fear Allah and do not show mercy to the slaves of Allah. 
It makes no difference whether there are other women with her or not, or whether she is safe or not. Even if she goes with women from her own family and she is extremely safe, it is not permissible for her to travel without a mahram, because when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded that man to go and perform Hajj with his wife, he did not ask whether there were other women with her or not, or whether she was safe or not. The fact that he did not ask about that indicates that it makes no difference. This is the correct view. 
Some people nowadays take the matter lightly and allow women travelling alone in a plane without a mahram . This undoubtedly goes against the clear meaning of the texts. Travel by plane is like any other kind of travel and still involves danger. 
If the mahram of a woman travelling by plane takes her to the airport, as soon as she reaches the departure hall, he has to leave her there, then she is on her own without a mahram. The plane may leave on time or it may be late. It may leave on time but then have to come back for some reason, or it may land in another airport which is not the one she was heading for, and so on. It may land in the airport she is heading for after the expected time for some reason. If it happens that it lands on time, the mahram who is supposed to meet her may be late for some reason, either because he overslept or because of traffic congestion, or because his car broke down, or for some other reason.  And even if he is there on time and meets the woman, there may have been a man sitting next to her on the plane who would deceive her and may like her and she likes him.
 The point is that women should fear Allah and not travel for Hajj or for any other reason except with a mahram who is an adult of sound mind. And Allah is the One Whose help we seek.
