41702,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/41702,Obligation of performing Hajj straightaway,Is it permissible for a person who is able to do Hajj to delay Hajj for a number of years?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.If a person is able to do Hajj and meets all the conditions of it being obligatory, then he must do Hajj straight away, and it is not permissible for him to delay it. 
Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni: 
If a person is obliged to do Hajj and is able to do it, he must do it straight away and it is not permissible for him to delay it. This is the view of Abu Haneefah and Maalik. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah) to the House (Ka‘bah) is a duty that mankind owes to Allaah, those who can afford the expenses (for one’s conveyance, provision and residence); and whoever disbelieves [i.e. denies Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah), then he is a disbeliever of Allaah], then Allaah stands not in need of any of the ‘Aalameen (mankind, jinn and all that exists)”
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:97] 
The command is to do it straight away. 
And it was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever wants to do Hajj, let him hasten to do it.” Narrated by Imam Ahmad, Abu Dawood and Ibn Maajah. According to a version narrated by Ahmad and Ibn Maajah: “…for he may fall sick or be faced with some need.” Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah. End quote. 
What is meant by “let him hasten to do it” is that a person who is accountable must do what is enjoined upon him as soon as he becomes able to do it, and it is not permissible for him to delay it with no excuse. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: Does the command to do Hajj mean that it must be done immediately or may one do it at one's leisure? 
He replied: 
The correct view is that it must be done straight away and it is not permissible for a person who is able to go on Hajj to the Sacred House of Allaah to delay it. The same applies to all the duties enjoined by sharee’ah: if there is no set time or reason, they must be done immediately. End quote. 
Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 21/13.",Islam Q&A
41703,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/41703,Feeling fed up of life,I am a young man who has become fed up of living in this transient world. I have started to feel bored and tired of it. Is there anyone who can help? There is none who can help except Allah!.,,,"Praise be to Allah.There are many reasons for hating this world. There are some people who dislike this transient world and long for that which is with Allah of reward, and who love to meet Allah. Hence some of the salaf said: “The gift of the believer is death.” For he detests this world and his heart is attached to the Hereafter. Yet despite his dislike for this world, he carries out his duties towards Allah and His slaves, and he strives to do good as much as he can, in accordance with the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): 
 
“And worship your Lord until there comes unto you the certainty (i.e. death)”
[al-Hijr 15:99] 
And there are some people who detest this world, not because of the Hereafter, but because they think that their share of it is very little, and that others are better off then them. Undoubtedly this is a kind of discontent with the will and decree of Allah, for Allah is the One Who bestows blessings and distributes provisions, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And if Allah were to enlarge the provision for His slaves, they would surely rebel in the earth, but He sends down by measure as He wills. Verily, He is, in respect of His slaves, the Well‑Aware, the All‑Seer (of things that benefit them)”
[al-Shoora 42:27]
Some people hate this world because they have been faced with a great deal of trial, stress and exhaustion in it. Undoubtedly these people do not understand the true nature of this world. This world is the realm of striving and trial, the realm of stress and exhaustion, especially for the righteous believer, who encounters all kinds of trials by means of which Allah expiates his sins and raises him in status. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, We have created man in toil”
[al-Balad 90:4] 
“Do people think that they will be left alone because they say: ‘We believe,’ and will not be tested.
3. And We indeed tested those who were before them. And Allah will certainly make (it) known (the truth of) those who are true, and will certainly make (it) known (the falsehood of) those who are liars, (although Allah knows all that before putting them to test)”
[al-‘Ankaboot 29:2-3] 
 
“Allah will not leave the believers in the state in which you are now, until He distinguishes the wicked from the good. Nor will Allah disclose to you the secrets of the Ghayb (Unseen), but Allah chooses of His Messengers whom He wills. So believe in Allah and His Messengers. And if you believe and fear Allah, then for you there is a great reward”
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:179] 
“And certainly, We shall test you with something of fear, hunger, loss of wealth, lives and fruits, but give glad tidings to As‑ Saabiroon (the patient).
156. Who, when afflicted with calamity, say: “Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return.”
157. They are those on whom are the Salawaat (i.e. who are blessed and will be forgiven) from their Lord, and (they are those who) receive His Mercy, and it is they who are the guided ones”
[al-Baqarah 2:155-157]
My dear brother… into which of these categories do you fall? 
Remember how the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was tested. His people showed enmity towards him, and the closest of people to him resisted him. Some people slandered him, others persecuted him. He was thrown out of his home and was subjected to a harsh boycott. The kuffaar gathered together to kill him, and his wife Khadeejah (may Allah be pleased with her) died at the most difficult time. He would go for a month or two at a time without eating anything but dates and water. All of this happened even though he was the Prophet of Allah, and His Messenger, the one to whom Allah entrusted His Revelation. All of this happened even though he is the owner of the position of praise and glory (al-maqaam al-mahmoud) and the Cistern (al-hawd) to which his ummah will come (on the Day of Resurrection). All of this happened even though his sins, past and future, had been forgiven. 
So what about us, with all our sins and shortcomings? 
I advise you to do the following: 
Firstly: make a lot of du’aa’, calling upon Allah, and seek to draw close to Him by different kinds of worship, such as praying, giving zakaah, fasting and so on. Beseech Allah to take away what is in your heart (of sorrow etc) and to grant you relief. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Those who believed (in the Oneness of Allah — Islamic Monotheism), and whose hearts find rest in the remembrance of Allah verily, in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest”
[al-Ra’d 13:28] 
“Verily, those who are Al-Muttaqoon (the pious), when an evil thought comes to them from Shaytaan (Satan), they remember (Allah), and (indeed) they then see (aright)”
[al-A’raaf 7:201]
Secondly: Understand that whatever Allah decrees for His believing slave is all good. No matter how difficult your life may become, to Allah belong all things in the heavens and the earth. So set things straight between yourself and Allah, and Allah will suffice you against having any need of people. 
Thirdly: Your depression and tiredness may be because of something that you have missed out on and not acquired or achieved. In that case you should know how often a person has pursued something, not realizing that in it lay his doom; and how often has a person grieved for missing out on something he wanted, but he does not know that had he attained it, it would have spelled loss in both his spiritual and worldly affairs. So accept the will and decree of Allah, and seek the help of Allah, and do not feel helpless. 
Fourthly: Check your heart and mind, and examine your relationship with Allah thoroughly, because a person may be denied provision because of sins that he commits. 
Fifthly: You may have some personal or family problems; the way to solve these problems is by prioritizing them. Seek the help of Allah (first and foremost), then the help of experienced people to solve these problems, and resolve these issues. 
Sixthly: remember that the most sorely tried of all people were the Prophets, then the next best and the next best. It is proven in al-Musnad from the hadeeth of Mus’ab ibn Sa’d that his father said: I said: O Messenger of Allah, which of the people are most sorely tested? He said: “The Prophets, then the righteous, then the next best, then the next best of people. A man will be tested according to his level of religious commitment. If there is some solidness in his religious commitment, he will be more sorely tested, and if there is some weakness in his religious commitment the test will be lightened for him. A man will continue to be tested until he walks upon the face of the earth with no sin on him.” Musnad al-Imam Ahmad, no. 1481. Shaykh Shu’ayb al-Arna’oot said: its isnaad is hasan. And it was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, no. 992. 
Seventhly: Persist in praying for forgiveness and in worshipping. That is better for you than all the worldly steps you can take, no matter how great and how many they are. This will also relieve your worries. It was narrated in some reports that whoever persists in praying for forgiveness, Allah will grant him a way out from every worry and hardship and will grant him provision from sources he never thought of. 
So persist in worshipping Allah, and act in accordance with the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning):  
 
“And worship your Lord until there comes unto you the certainty (i.e. death)”
[al-Hijr 15:99] 
“And strain not your eyes in longing for the things We have given for enjoyment to various groups of them (polytheists and disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah), the splendour of the life of this world, that We may test them thereby. But the provision (good reward in the Hereafter) of your Lord is better and more lasting”
[Ta-Ha 20:131] 
May Allah help us and you to do and say that which is right. And Allah knows best.

41709,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/41709,Should he pray istikhaarah before performing Hajj?,Is it mustahabb to pray istikhaarah before travelling for Hajj?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.The hadeeth which is narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) concerning istikhaarah is comprehensive and includes all matters which may be of concern to people and which they may not know whether it is better to do it or not. So they may pray istikhaarah and ask Allaah for guidance. But that does not include things that are enjoined on a man, because doing things that are required of him is good and there is no room for hesitation about that. Based on this, if Hajj is obligatory for a person and the conditions of it being obligatory have been fulfilled, then he should go for Hajj without praying istikhaarah. By the same token, if the adhaan is given for Zuhr prayer, for example, it is obligatory for him to pray without praying istikhaarah; and if jihad becomes obligatory for him as an individual obligation (fard ‘ayn), he has to engage in jihad without praying istikhaarah.  
But if it is something that is allowed in Islam but is not obligatory, then he may pray istikhaarah concerning it. Some permissible things are better than others. A man may want to go and perform a voluntary ‘Umrah, or a voluntary Hajj, but he does not know whether it is better for him to go for Hajj or to stay in his country to call others to Allaah and teach the Muslims and take care of his family. So he should pray istikhaarah and ask Allaah for guidance, not because he has any doubts about the virtues of ‘Umrah, but because he is not sure whether it is better to go for ‘Umrah or stay in his country. This is something understandable and one can pray istikhaarah about this.  
Whoever studies the hadeeth about istikhaarah and the teachings of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) will realize that it has only been prescribed in cases where one may be hesitant. In cases where there is no hesitation or uncertainty, there is no need for istikhaarah. As I have stated above, in the case of obligatory duties there is no room for hesitation or doubt about doing them, because it is obligatory for the one who meets the conditions of their being obligatory to do them.

    If the wife has stipulated in the marriage contract that he 
    must take her for Hajj, then he has to fulfil this condition and take her 
    for Hajj, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said: “The most deserving of conditions to be fulfilled are those by 
    means of which intimacy becomes permissible for you.” And Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “O you who believe! Fulfil (your) obligations”

    [al-Maa'idah 5:1] 

    “And fulfil (every) covenant. Verily, the covenant will be 
    questioned about”

    [al-Isra’ 17:34]

    If she did not stipulate this condition, then he does not 
    have to take her for Hajj, but I advise him to take her for Hajj for a 
    number of reasons: 

    1 – Seeking reward, because a reward like hers will be 
    written for him too, and she will have fulfilled an obligatory duty. 

    2 – That will create love between them, and everything that 
    will create love between husband and wife is enjoined. 

    3 – He will be praised for this action and he will set an 
    example for people to follow. 

    So let him seek the help of Allaah and take his wife for 
    Hajj, whether she stipulated that he should do so or not. But if she did 
    stipulate that, then he is obliged to fulfil it. End quote.","Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him)  - Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 21/114"
41731,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/41731,Prohibition on stepping over people who are sitting in the mosque on Friday,I hope that you can tell us the ruling on stepping over people who are sitting in the mosque on Friday – is it haram or not?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Abu Dawood (1118) and Ibn Maajah (1115) narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn Busr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: A man came and started stepping over the people one Friday when the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was delivering the khutbah, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him: “Sit down, for you have annoyed (people).” Classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
In this hadith there is a prohibition on stepping over people when coming to Jumu’ah (Friday) prayer. 
The scholars differed concerning this matter and there are two views. 
1 – That it is makrooh. This was narrated by Ibn al-Mundhir from the majority. Ibn Hajar said: The majority are of the view that it is makrooh in the sense that it is better not to do it. This is the well-known view of the Shaafa’is and is the view of the Hanbalis. 
See: Fath al-Bari, 2/392; Kashshaaf al-Qinaa’, 2/44; al-Majmoo’, 4/466 
Malik and al-Awzaa’i limited its being makrooh to when the khateeb is on the minbar, It says in al-Mudawwanah (1/159): Malik said: Rather it is makrooh to step over people when the imam has come out and has sat on the minbar. Whoever steps over people then is the one of whom the hadith speaks. But before that there is nothing wrong with it if there is a gap in front of him, but he should be polite in doing that. End quote. 
2 – That stepping over others is haram in all cases, on Fridays and at other times, because of the hadith of ‘Abd-Allah ibn Busr (may Allah be pleased with him) in which he said: A man came and started stepping over the people one Friday when the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was delivering the khutbah, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him: “Sit down, for you have annoyed (people).”
Narrated by Abu Dawood, 1118; Ibn Maajah, 1115; classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
Al-Tirmidhi said: This is what is to be followed according to the scholars. They regarded it as makrooh for a man to step over people on Friday, and they were very strict with regard to that. End quote. 
This is what a number of scholars regarded as more likely to be correct, such as Ibn al-Mundhir, Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr, al-Nawawi, and Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, as stated in al-Ikhtiyaaraat al-Fiqhiyyah, p. 81, and others. Among contemporary scholars who held this view is Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen. 
Ibn al-Mundhir said, explaining the reason why he said it is haram: That is because causing annoyance is haram, whether it is a little or a lot, and this is causing annoyance, as it says in the saheeh hadith in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to one whom he saw stepping over people: “Sit down, for you are causing annoyance.” Al-Majmoo’, 4/467.
 Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said in al-Tamheed (1/316): The words of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to the one who was stepping over people on a Friday, “You are causing annoyance,” indicate that stepping over people is an annoyance, and it is not permissible to annoy a Muslim under any circumstances, on Friday or at any other time. 
Al-Nawawi said in Rawdat al-Taalibeen (11/224): The favoured view is that stepping over people is haram, because of the ahadith on this topic.
 Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: Stepping over people is haram during the khutbah and at other times, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to a man whom he saw stepping over people: “Sit down, for you are causing annoyance.” That is even more forbidden if it happens during the khutbah, because it is causing annoyance to people and distracting them from listening to the khutbah, even if he is moving towards a gap.""(Fatawa wa Rasaa’il al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 16/147).",Islam Q&A
41732,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/41732,Can Someone Perform Hajj on Your Behalf?,What is the ruling on appointing a deputy to perform Hajj on one’s behalf?,"It is not permissible to appoint someone to perform obligatory Hajj on your behalf. If you have already performed the obligatory Hajj, there is a difference of opinion among the scholars.","Hajj on your behalf


Can someone perform obligatory Hajj on your behalf?","Praise be to Allah.Hajj on your behalf
One of the following two scenarios must apply when a person appoints someone to perform Hajj on his behalf :

That is for an obligatory Hajj
That is for a nafl Hajj. 

Can someone perform obligatory Hajj on your behalf?
If appointing someone to perform Hajj on his behalf is for an obligatory Hajj, it is not permissible for a person to appoint someone else to do Hajj and ‘Umrah on his behalf, except in the case where he is unable to reach the Ka’bah himself because of an ongoing illness for which there is no hope of a cure, or because of old age and the like. If there is the hope of recovery from that sickness, then he should wait until Allah heals him and then perform Hajj himself.  
If there is no impediment to performing Hajj, rather he is able to do Hajj himself, then it is not permissible for him to appoint someone to perform it on his behalf, because he is the one from whom that is required, personally. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah) to the House (Ka‘bah) is a duty that mankind owes to Allah, those who can afford the expenses (for one’s conveyance, provision and residence).” [Al ‘Imran 3:97]
The point of acts of worship is that each person should do them himself, so that he will submit and humble himself before Allah. It is obvious that this purpose, for which acts of worship have been prescribed, is not achieved in the case of one who delegates someone else to do it on his behalf.
Can someone perform voluntary Hajj on your behalf?
But if the person has already performed the obligatory Hajj and he wants to appoint someone else to go and do Hajj and ‘Umrah, then in this case there is a difference of opinion among the scholars. Some of them said that it is permissible, and others disallowed it.
The most correct view in my opinion is that it is not allowed, because it is not permissible for anyone to appoint someone else to perform Hajj or ‘Umrah on his behalf if that is nafl. The basic principle concerning acts of worship is that each person should do them for himself. Just as no one can appoint someone else to fast on his behalf, although if he dies and owes some obligatory fasts, his heirs may fast on his behalf, the same applies to Hajj, which is an act of worship which a person should do himself, physically.
It is not a financial act of worship which is intended to benefit others. Because it is a physical act of worship which a person must do himself, it is not valid if it is done by someone else on his behalf, except in the cases mentioned in the Sunnah, but there is no mention in the Sunnah of anyone doing a nafl Hajj on behalf of someone else. 
This is one of the two views narrated from Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him), i.e., that it is not valid for a person to appoint someone to perform nafl Hajj or ‘Umrah on his behalf, whether he is able to do it or not. 
Based on the above, the rich who are able to do Hajj themselves should do it themselves, because some people spend many years not going to Makkah and sending someone else to do Hajj on their behalf every year. Thus they miss out on the purpose for which Hajj was prescribed, based on their appointing someone else to perform Hajj on their behalf.” (Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 21/136)
The scholars of the Standing Committee favoured the view that it is permissible to do Hajj and ‘Umrah on behalf of a living person who is unable to do that, even if that is nafl.  
It says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah (11/81): 
“If you have done ‘Umrah for yourself, it is permissible for you to do ‘Umrah on behalf of your mother and father if they are unable to do it because of old age or sickness for which there is no hope of a cure.”
This view was also favoured by Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him). When he was asked: “I want to perform Hajj on behalf of my mother; is it essential to ask her permission, knowing that she has already performed the obligatory Hajj?” 
He replied: 
“If your mother is unable to perform Hajj because she is elderly or is sick and there is no hope of recovery, then there is nothing wrong with performing Hajj on her behalf, even if that is without her permission. 
It is narrated that a man asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) for permission, saying, “O Messenger of Allah, my father is an old man who cannot perform Hajj and ‘Umrah.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do Hajj and ‘Umrah on behalf of your father.” 
And a woman asked him for permission saying, “O Messenger of Allah, my father is an old man and cannot perform Hajj and ‘Umrah and he cannot travel, can I perform Hajj on his behalf?” He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do Hajj on behalf of your father.” Similarly many ahadih speak of performing Hajj on behalf of the dead.” (Fatawa Ibn Baz, 16/414)

Etiquette of travelling for Hajj","Praise be to Allah.Etiquettes of travelling in Islam
There are many points of etiquette to be followed by the traveller, which the scholars have compiled. One of those who compiled these rulings well was An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him), in his book Al-Majmu` (4/264-287), where he mentions sixty-two points of etiquette. We will mention some of them in brief, and anyone who wants to know more may consult the writings of An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him). 
He (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Chapter on the etiquette of travelling: 
This is an important topic, for which there is a great need. 
Our aim here is to refer to this etiquette in brief. 
·         When a person wants to travel, it is recommended for him to consult those whose religious commitment, experience and knowledge he trusts about travelling at that time. The one who is consulted must be sincere in offering advice and avoid being influenced by whims and desires. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and consult them in the affairs.” [Al ‘Imran 3:159]
The authentic Hadiths indicate that the people used to consult the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) with regard to their affairs. 
·         Once he has decided to travel, the Sunnah is to seek Allah’s guidance by praying Istikharah. So he should pray two Rak’ahs of non-obligatory prayer, then recite the Du`a of Istikharah. 
·         If he has decided to travel for Hajj or Jihad or any other purpose, he should start by repenting from all sins and disliked actions, and he should put right any wrongs he has done towards people and pay off whatever he can of the debts he owes them; he should also return anything that has been entrusted to him and seek forgiveness from anyone with whom he has any dealings or friendship. He should write his will and have it witnessed, and he should appoint someone to pay off the debts that he was not able to pay. He should also leave with his family and those on whom he is obliged to spend enough funds to cover their needs until he returns. 
·         He should seek to please his parents and those whom he is obliged to honour and obey. 
·         If he is travelling for Hajj or Jihad or any other purpose, he should strive to ensure that his funds are lawfully earned and free from any suspicion. If he goes against this and goes for Hajj or Jihad with wealth that has been seized by force, he is a sinner and although his Hajj or Jihad may be outwardly valid, it will not be an accepted Hajj (Hajj Mabrur). 
·         It is recommended for the one who is travelling to Hajj or for any other purpose for which provision is carried to take a great deal of provision and money with him, so that he can share them with those who are in need. His provisions should be good (lawfully earned), because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Spend of the good things which you have (lawfully) earned, and of that which We have produced from the earth for you, and do not aim at that which is bad to spend from it.” [Al-Baqarah 2:267]
He should give willingly so that it will be more likely to be accepted. 
·         If he wants to travel for Hajj or Jihad, he should learn about how they are to be done, for no act of worship is valid if done by one who does not know it properly. It is recommended for the one who wants to do Hajj to take with him a clear book about the rituals which also speaks about their aims, and he should read it constantly and often throughout his journey, so that it will become fixed in his mind. Hence there is the fear that for some of the common folk, their Hajj will not be valid because they fail to fulfil one of the conditions and so on. And some of them may imitate some of the common folk of Makkah, thinking that they know the rituals properly and thus being deceived by them. That is a serious mistake. Similarly in the case of one who is going out for Jihad etc, it is recommended for him to take a book which speaks of what he needs to know, and the warrior should learn what he needs to know about fighting and the Du`as to be said at that time, and the prohibitions on treachery, killing women and children, and so on. The one who is travelling for the purpose of trade should learn what he needs to know about buying and selling, which transactions are valid and which are invalid, what is lawful and what is prohibited, and so on. 
·         It is recommended for him to seek a companion who desires good and hates evil, so that if he forgets, he (companion) can remind him, if he remembers, he can help him, and if he happens to be a man of knowledge, he should stick with him, because he will help him to avoid bad attitudes such as boredom with travel and he can help him to maintain a noble attitude and encourage him to do so. 
He should also be keen to please his companion throughout the journey. Each of them should put up with the other and view his companion with respect, and be patient with whatever he may do at some times. 
·         It is recommended for him to bid farewell to his family, neighbours, friends and all his loved ones. He should bid them farewell and he should say to each of them: “I place your religion, your faithfulness and the ends of your deeds in the trust of Allah.” The one who is staying behind should say to the traveller: “May Allah bless you with Taqwa and forgive you your sins and make goodness easy for you wherever you are.” 
·         It is Sunnah to say the following Du`a when leaving the house: Bismillah, tawakkaltu ‘ala Allah, wa la hawla wa la quwwata illa Billah. Allahumma inni a’udhu bika min an adilla aw udalla aw azilla aw uzalla aw athlima aw uthlama aw ajhala aw yujhal ‘alayya (In the name of Allah, I put my trust in Allah and there is no power and no strength except with Allah. O Allah, I seek refuge with You lest I should stray or be led astray, or slip or be tripped, or do wrong or be wronged, or behave foolishly or be treated foolishly).” 
·         The Sunnah when leaving one's house and wanting to get up on one's mount is to say Bismillah. Then when he has mounted it he should say: “Al-hamdu Lillah illadhi sakhkhara lana hadha wa ma kunna lahu muqrinien wa inna ila rabbina la munqalibun (In the name of Allah… All praise be to Allah Who has placed this (transport) at our service and we ourselves would not have been capable of that, and to our Lord is our final destiny.” Then he should say Al-hamdu Lillah (praise be to Allah) three times and Allahu Akbar (Allah is most Great) three times, then, “Subhanaka inni thalamtu nafsi faghfir li innahu la yaghfir udh-dhunuba illa anta (Glory be to You, verily I have wronged myself, so forgive me, for surely no one can forgive sins except You).” 
And: “Allahumma inna nas’aluka fi safarina hadha al-birra wa’t-taqwa wa min al-’aml ma tarda, Allahumma hawwin ‘alayna safarana hadha watwi ‘anna bu’dahu.

O Allah, facilitate our journey and let us cover its distance quickly. O Allah, You are the Companion on the journey and the Successor (the One Who guards them in a person’s absence) over the family. O Allah, I seek refuge with You from the difficulties of travel, from having a change of heart and from being in a bad predicament, and I seek refuge with You from an ill-fated outcome with regard to wealth and family).” When returning the same words are recited with the following addition: “Ayibuna ta’ibuna ‘abiduna li rabbina hamidun (Returning, repenting, worshipping and praising our Lord).” 
·         It is recommended to travel with a group of people , because of the Hadith of ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If the people knew what I know about being alone, no one would ever travel alone at night.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari)
·         It is recommended for the group to appoint the best and wisest amongst them as their leader, and to obey him, because of the Hadith of Abu Sa’id and Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with them) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When three people set out on a journey, let them appoint one of them as their leader.” (This is a sound Hadith narrated by Abu Dawud with a sound Isnad (chain of narration)) 
·         It is recommended to set out at the end of the night, because of the Hadith of Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “You should travel at the end of the night (or throughout the night) because it is easier to cover a greater distance at night.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud and was classed as sound. It was also narrated by Al-Hakim who said: it is authentic according to the conditions of Al-Bukhari and Muslim)  
·         He should adopt a kind and good attitude, and avoid arguing or pushing and shoving people on the road. He should guard his tongue against insults, backbiting, cursing his mount or any other kind of foul speech. 
·         It is recommended for the traveller to say Takbir when going up a rise in the land and to say Tasbih when going down into valleys and the like. 
·         If he sees a village or town that he wants to enter, it is recommended for him to say: “Allahumma as’aluka khayraha wa khayra ahliha wa khayra ma fiha wa ‘a’udhu bika min sharriha wa sharri ahliha wa sharri ma fiha (O Allah, I ask You for its goodness, the goodness of its people and the goodness of what is in it, and I seek refuge with You from its evil, the evil of its people and the evil of what is in it).” 
·         It is recommended for him to make Du`a most of the time when travelling , because his Du`a will be answered. 
·         He should try to remain in a state of purity and to pray on time. Allah has made it easy by allowing Tayammum and joining and shortening of prayers. 
·         The Sunnah when stopping in a place is to say what was narrated by Khawlah bint Hakeem (may Allah be pleased with her), who said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “Whoever makes a stop then says: ‘A’udhu bi kalimat Allah it-tammati min sharri ma khalaq (I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allah from the evil of that which He has created),’ nothing will harm him until he moves on from that place.” (Narrated by Muslim)
·         It is recommended for a travelling group to camp close to one another and not to be scattered or separated needlessly, because of the Hadith of Abu Tha’labah Al-Khushani (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: When the people stopped in a place, they would scatter in the mountain passes and valleys. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Your scattering in these mountain passes and valleys is something from the devil.” After that, they never stopped in any place without being close together. (Narrated by Abu Dawood with a sound Isnad)
·         The Sunnah for the traveller is that when he has done what he set out to do, he should hasten to return to his family, because of the Hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Travel is a kind of torment, which keeps one of you from his food and drink. When one of you has finished what he set out to do, let him hasten back to his family.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim) 
·         The Sunnah is to say when returning from a journey that which is narrated in the Hadith of Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), when he came back from a campaign or from Hajj and ‘Umrah, he would say Takbir on every high ground three times, then he would say, ‘La ilaha ill-Allah wahdahu la sharika lah, lahu’l-mulk wa lahu’l-hamd wa huwa ‘ala kulli shay’in qadir. Ayibuna ta’ibuna ‘abiduna, sajiduna li rabbina hamidun. Sadaqa Allahu wa’dah wa nasara ‘abdah wa hazama al-ahzaba wahdah
(There is none worthy of worship but Allah alone, with no partner or associate. His is the Dominion, to Him be all praise, and He is Able to do all things. Returning, repenting, worshipping, prostrating to our Lord and praising Him. Allah fulfilled His promise, granted victory to His slave and defeated the confederates Alone). (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim) 
Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: We came back with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and when we reached the outskirts of Madinah he said: “Ayibuna ta’ibuna ‘abiduna li rabbina hamidun (Returning, repenting, worshipping and praising our Lord).” And he kept saying that until we came to Madinah. (Narrated by Muslim)
·         The Sunnah when returning home is to start by going to the mosque that is nearest one's home and praying two Rak’ahs with the intention of offering Salat Al-qudum (the prayer of arrival), because of the Hadith of Ka’b ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), when he came back from a journey, would start by going to the mosque where he would pray two rak’ahs and then sit down. (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)
·         It is recommended to make food for the returning traveller, whether it is made by the traveller himself or by someone else for him, as indicated by the Hadith of Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), when he came back to Madinah from a journey, would slaughter a camel or a cow. (Narrated by Al-Bukhari) 
·         It is prohibited for a woman to travel without a Mahram unnecessarily, whether that is a long or a short distance, because of the Hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible for a woman who believes in Allah and the Last Day to travel for the distance of one day and one night except with a Mahram.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim).”  (Al-Majmu`, 4/264-287)
Etiquette of travelling for Hajj
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“The etiquette of travelling for Hajj is divided into two categories: obligatory and recommended. The obligatory etiquette means that the traveller should fulfil all the obligations and pillars (essential parts) of Hajj, and avoid the things that are forbidden whilst in the state of Ihram in particular, and the things that are forbidden in general, whether they are forbidden whilst in Ihram or when not in Ihram, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The Hajj (pilgrimage) is (in) the well-known (lunar year) months (i.e. the 10th month, the 11th month and the first ten days of the 12th month of the Islamic calendar, i.e. two months and ten days). So whosoever intends to perform Hajj therein (by assuming Ihram), then he should not have sexual relations (with his wife), nor commit sin, nor dispute unjustly during the Hajj.” [Al-Baqarah 2:197]
The recommended etiquette when travelling for Hajj is for a person to do all the things that he should do, such as being generous to people, serving his brothers, putting up with their annoyance, not retaliating to mistreatment, and being kind to them, whether that is after he assumes Ihram or before, because this etiquette is sublime and good, and is required of every believer at all times and in all places. There are also other points of etiquette that has to do with the act of worship, such as doing Hajj in the most perfect manner and striving to do it with the proper etiquette in both word and deed.” (Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 21/16)

41739,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/41739,Can You Go Hajj with a Mortgage?,I know that Hajj is not obligatory for one who owes a debt. Does this apply to one who has long-term debts? Some people may have mortgages which it will take a lifetime to pay off. Do they have to perform Hajj?,"If a person owes a debt to the mortgage fund, if he knows that when the time comes he will pay his debt, then Hajj is obligatory for him, even if he owes a debt.",,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
“A debt which is due now takes precedence over Hajj, because this obligation comes before Hajj. So he should pay off the debt and do Hajj . If he has nothing left after paying off the debt , then he should wait until Allah makes him independent of means. 
If it is a long-term debt to be paid off at a future date, and the person feels confident that he will be able to pay it on the agreed date, then in this case the debt does not mean that Hajj is not obligatory for him, whether the lender gives him permission or not. If there is no guarantee that he will be able to pay it off as agreed, then he should wait until the date for the payment comes. 
Based on that we say, if a person owes a debt to the mortgage fund , if he knows that when the time comes he will pay his debt, then Hajj is obligatory for him, even if he owes a debt.” (Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 21/96) .

41760,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/41760,It is not permissible to drink alcohol for medicinal purposes,Some doctors advise their patients to drink wine and say that it is a kind of medicine. What is the ruling on drinking wine for that purpose?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Medical treatment is something that is prescribed in sharee’ah, but it must be by using things that have been prescribed by Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and by His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), because this is what may contain the cure. As for that which Allah has forbidden, there is no healing in it. One of the things which indicate that it is forbidden to treat disease with haraam things in general and with alcohol in particular, is the mu’allaq report narrated by al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh from Ibn Mas’ood (may Allah be pleased with him), which says, “Allah did not put your healing in that which He has forbidden to you.” Al-Tabaraani said that it was mawsool and gave an isnaad the men of which are the men of al-saheeh. It was also narrated by Ahmad and by Ibn Hibbaan in his Saheeh, and by al-Bazaar, Abu Ya’la and al-Tabaraani; the men of Abu Ya’laa are thiqaat. It was narrated from Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her). 
Abu Dawood narrated in his Sunan that Abu’l-Darda’ (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has sent down the disease and the cure, and He has made for every disease a cure. So treat sickness, but do not treat it with anything haraam.”  
In Saheeh Muslim it is narrated from Taariq ibn Suwayd al-Ju’fi that he asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about alcohol and he forbade him or told him not to make it. He said: “But I make it as a remedy.” He said: “It is not a remedy, it is a disease.” 
It is worth pointing out that when Allah enjoins something, it is either because it is purely good or its goodness outweighs its evil. And when He forbids something it is either because it is purely bad or because its evil outweighs its goodness. Allah is All Wise and All Knowing. If the sick person imagines that his sickness can only be cured by drinking alcohol, this is an illusion. There are many kinds of medicine and remedies, both spiritual and natural. Moreover the medicine does not heal the disease, rather healing comes from Allah when the medicine is used. So use of the means prescribed in sharee’ah may be accompanied by total reliance upon them or it may be accompanied by regarding them as no more than a means, whilst relying upon Allah and believing that they may or may not be of benefit. If they prove to be of benefit, this is what was wanted, but relying on them completely is shirk. End quote.","Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 22/87"

He replied: 
If you live in a separate house, then it is prescribed for you to offer a sacrifice on behalf of yourself and the members of your household, and your father’s sacrifice does not count for you, which is on behalf of him and the members of his household, because you do not live in the same house with them, rather you live in a separate house.
