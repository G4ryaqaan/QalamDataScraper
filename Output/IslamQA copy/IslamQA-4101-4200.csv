    inject kohl or some other substance to change the skin colour to blue or green. This is
    haraam according to the consensus of the scholars. (al-Mughni 1/94)
    Al-Bukhaari and Muslim narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah
    ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) said:
“Allaah has cursed the women who do tattoos and the women who have
    this done, the women who pluck their eyebrows, and the women who file their teeth for the
    purpose of beautification and change the creation of Allaah.”",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

      guided me, now I am a practising muslimah. but the problem is him, every salaat he is
      preying is like I am forcing him, I treid every thing but nothing is working, same people
      said you have to leave him but it isn't easy I have three childern with him, and he is
      good father and husband. The problem between us is the DEEN. Please what shoul I do.",,,"Praise be to Allah.We put the following question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih
    al-Uthaymeen:
I am married to a man who neglects his prayer. Allaah has guided me and
    I insisted that he should pray, so he started to pray as if he was forced to do so. He has
    clearly told me, I am only praying because of you. Is it permissible for me to
    stay with him or not?
The shaykh  may Allaah preserve him  answered as follows:
If the marriage contract was made at the time when he was not praying,
    then it is not valid, and if this is the case then she has to keep away from him. If he
    becomes Muslim, the contract is renewed, and if he does not become Muslim, then Allaah
    will send her a Muslim man who is better than him.
Question:
If she got married to him when she too was not praying, and he was not
    praying, does this make the marriage null and void?
Answer:
If they were following a certain religion, then the marriage remains
    valid, but if they were not following any religion and were murtadd (apostates), then many
    of the scholars say that the marriage of apostates is not valid, because they are not
    following any religion, neither Islam nor the religion from which they apostatized.
Question:
If the husband who is praying clearly tells his wife that he is praying
    only for her sake, is that sufficient to count him as a murtadd (apostate), or should she
    go by what she sees, which is that he is praying?
Answer:
It seems to me that he is praying to Allaah to please her. This does
    not means that his whole prayer, the standing, bowing, prostrating and duaa,
    is directed towards her. He is praying to Allaah to please her, and that does not make him
    a mushrik. And Allaah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

2)The scripture revealed to Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him) is lost but it is mentioned in the Noble Quran in different chapters? Give two references from two chapters in the Noble Quran mentioning this scripture.

3)Which country has the highest Muslim population? How did the people of this country become Muslims?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    1. The Quran indicates that Y’aqub (peace be upon him) gave final 
    instructions to his sons before he died. “… he said unto his sons, ‘What 
    will you worship after me?’ They said, ‘We shall worship your Ilah (God — 
    Allah) the Ilah (God) of your fathers, Ibrahim, Isma‘il, Ishaq, One Ilah 
    (God), and to Him we submit (in Islam).’” [2:133 – interpretation of the 
    meaning].
    2. The scripture of Ibrahim (peace be upon him) is mentioned in Surat 
    al-A’ala 87:19 (interpretation of the meaning): “The Scriptures of Ibrahim 
    and Musa”; and in Surat al-Najm 53:36-37 (interpretation of the meaning): 
    “Or is he not informed with what is in the Pages (Scripture) of Musa (Mose), 
    and of Ibrahim who fulfilled (or conveyed) all that (Allah ordered him to do 
    or convey).” 
    3. The country with the largest Muslim population in Africa is Nigeria, and

      said:
  
      
 There is no saheeh isnaad from the Prophet

      says that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)

      you then considered Al-Laat, and Al-‘Uzzaa (two idols of the
      pagan Arabs),And Manaat
      (another idol of the pagan Arabs), the other third?’ [al-Najm 53:19-20

      whose intercession is to be hopedfor.’
      The kuffaar were pleased with this praise of their three idols, so they
      prostrated.”
  
      
 This
      report is undoubtedly false on a number of counts.
  
      
 1.Its isnaad is very
      weak and is not saheeh.
  
      
2.The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was
      infallible with regard to the conveying of his Message.
  
      
3.Even if this report was saheeh, for argument’s sake, the scholars
      have stated that it is to be understood as meaning that the Shaytaan
      caused the kuffaar to hear these words, not that he put them in the mouth
      of the Prophet

      heard them from him.

4156,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4156,What can you do in one minute?,In our offices and workplaces we can hardly find time to do acts of worship and righteous deeds. What can we do in the short time that we can find in our day? How can we make use of it?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Time is of the essence, it is too precious to be wasted or neglected. The wise person is the one who pays attention to his time and does not treat it as a vessel to be filled with cheap things and vain talk. Instead, he limits it to worthy efforts and righteous deeds that please Allaah and benefit other people. Every minute of a person’s life carries the potential to raise his own status and to make his people happier, little by little.
 If you are keen to attain the highest position, and bring the most happiness to your people, then forget about relaxing and keep away from empty amusement.
 In one minute you can do a lot of good and earn much reward. In just one minute, by giving in charity, studying, memorizing, or striving to do good deeds, you can make sure that this minute of your life is not wasted.  One minute may be recorded in your book of good deeds if you know how to make the most of it and take care of it:
 Strive to make the most of each minute
If you forget it, you forget the most important thing, the truth.
 There follows a list of things that can be done in one minute, by the permission of Allaah:
1.     1.     In one minute you can recite Soorat al-Faatihah 3 times, reciting rapidly and silently. Some scholars said that the reward for reading al-Faatihah is more than 600 hasanahs, so if you read it 3 times you will, by the permission of Allaah, gain more than 1800 hasanahs – all of that in one minute.
2.     In one minute you can recite Soorat al-Ikhlaas (Qul Huwa Allaahu Ahad) 20 times, reciting rapidly and silently. Reciting it once is equivalent to one-third of the Qur’aan. If you read it 20 times it is equivalent to reading the Qur’aan 7 times. If you read it 20 times in one minute each day, you will have read it 600 times in one month, and 7200 times in one year, which will be equal in reward to reading the Qur’aan 2400 times.
3.     You can read one page of the Book of Allaah in one minute.
4.     You can memorize a short aayah of the Book of Allaah in one minute.
5.     In one minute you can say Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah wahdahu laa shareeka lah, lahu’l-mulk wa lahu’l-hamd wa huwa ‘ala kulli shay’in qadeer (There is no god except Allaah alone with no partner; to Him be dominion and praise, and He is Able to do all things) – 20 times. The reward for saying this is like freeing 8 slaves for the sake of Allaah from among the sons of Ismaa’eel.
6.     In one minute you can say Subhaan Allaahi wa bi hamdihi (Glory and praise be to Allaah) 100 times. Whoever says that in one day will be forgiven for his sins even if they are like the foam of the sea.
7.     In one minute you can say Subhaan Allaahi wa bi hamdihi Subhaan Allaah il-‘Azeem (Glory and praise be to Allaah, glory be to Allaah the Almighty) 50 times. These are two phrases which are light on the lips, heavy in the balance and beloved to the Most Merciful, as was narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim.
8.     The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When I say ‘Subhaan Allaah, wa’l-hamdu Lillah, wa laa ilaah ill-Allaah, wa Allaahu akbar (Glory be to Allaah, praise be to Allaah, there is no god except Allaah, and Allaah is Most Great)’, this is more beloved to me than all that the sun rises upon.” (Narrated by Muslim). In one minute, you can say all of these words more than 18 times. These words are the most beloved words to Allaah, the best of words, and they weigh heavily in the balance of good deeds, as was narrated in the saheeh ahaadeeth.
9.     In one minute you can say, Laa hawla wa laa quwwata illa Billaah (there is no strength and no power except with Allaah) more than 40 times. This is one of the treasures of Paradise, as was narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim. They are a means of putting up with difficulties and of aiming to achieve great things.
10. In one minute you can say Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah approximately 50 times. This is the greatest word, for it is the word of Tawheed, the good word, the word that stands firm. If these are the last words of a person, he will enter Paradise, and there are other reports which indicate how great these words are.
11. In one minute you can say Subhaan Allaah wa bi hamdih, ‘adada khalqihi, wa ridaa nafsihi, wazinata ‘arshihi, wa midaada kalimaatihi (Glory and praise be to Allaah, as much as the number of His creation, as much as pleases Him, as much as the weight of His Throne and as much as the ink of His words) more than 15 times. This words bring many more times the reward for other forms of tasbeeh and dhikr, as was reported in saheeh ahaadeeth from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).
12. In one minute you can seek the forgiveness of Allaah more than 100 times by saying “Astaghfir-Allaah (I seek the forgiveness of Allaah). The virtues of seeking forgiveness are no secret, for it is the means of attaining forgiveness and entering Paradise, and it is the means of being granted a good life, increasing one’s strength, warding off disasters, making things easier, bringing rain and increasing one’s wealth and children.
13. You can say a few brief and concise words in one minute, and Allaah may bring about some good through them that you could never imagine.
14. In one minute you can send blessings on the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 50 times by saying Sall-Allaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam (May Allaah bless him and grant him peace). In return Allaah will send blessings upon you 500 hundred times because one blessing brings ten like it.
15. In one minute you can motivate your heart to give thanks to Allaah, to love Him, to fear Him, to put hope in Him, to long for Him, and thus travel through the stages of ‘uboodiyyah (total enslavement to Allaah). You could do this when you are lying on your bed or walking in the street.
16. In one minute you can read more than two pages of a useful book that is easy to understand.
17. In one minute you can uphold the ties of kinship by calling a relative on the phone.
18. You can raise your hands and recite any du’aa’ you wish from the books of du’aa’, in one minute.
19. You can say salaams to and shake hands with a number of people in one minute.
20. You can forbid an evil action in one minute.
21. You can enjoin something good in one minute.
22. You can offer sincere advice to a brother in one minute.
23. You can console someone who is depressed in one minute.
24. You can remove something harmful from the road in one minute.
25. Making the most of one minute motivates you to make the most of other periods that would otherwise be wasted.
 Al-Shaafa’i (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:
 When people go to sleep, I let my tears flow, and I recite a verse of the most eloquent poetry
Is it not a waste that nights go by and I do not increase in knowledge, yet this time is counted as part of my life?
 Finally, the more sincere you are towards Allaah and the more aware you are of Him, the greater will be your reward and the more your hasanaat will increase.
Note that most of these actions will not cost you anything; they do not require tahaarah (purity) and they will not tire you out or take much effort. On the contrary, you can do them whilst you are walking, or in your car, or lying down, or standing, or sitting, or waiting for somebody. 
These actions are also among the greatest means of attaining happiness, expanding the chest (i.e., bringing relief and joy) and removing stress and anxiety. May Allaah help us and you to do that which He loves and which pleases Him. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.

      and designs on pieces of jewellery","What is the ruling on the following: 

1.                 Pieces of jewellery on which the Name of Allaah or names such as ‘Abd al-Rahmaan, ‘Abd-Allaah etc., are written? 

2.                 Pieces of jewellery on which signs of the zodiac (such as Aries, Scorpio, Libra, etc.) appear, whether they are imprinted or appear as a three-dimensional image that has a shadow? What is the ruling on praying wearing such items? 

3.                 Pieces of jewellery on which the picture of a head appears – without the body? 

4.                 Some pieces of gold which may be added to jewellery on which there is a picture of a man's profile, such as sovereigns bearing a profile of King George, etc. 

5.                 Stars of David (Jewish stars) or crosses, or any other symbols that are connected to the Jews and Christians? 

6.                 Gold rings that are designed specifically for men, which the shopkeepers say that they will not sell to Muslims?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly:
      it is not permissible to engrave aayaat from the Qur’aan or the Name of
      Allaah on metals or stone, because this is not the purpose for which these
      aayaat were revealed, and because there is the fear that this would expose
      these aayaat and the Name of Allaah to disrespect.  
Secondly:
      using these signs of the zodiac is an idea that comes from jaahiliyyah and
      the Muslim is obliged to steer clear of this and of everything that could
      lead to a revival of these jaahili ideas. This is in addition to the fact
      that they involve pictures of animate beings. On this basis it is not
      permissible to make or collect jewellery that bears these images, or to
      pray wearing such items. 
Thirdly
      and fourthly: the ahaadeeth which forbid images of animate beings are
      general in meaning and include all images which are called images of
      living beings. This also includes images of the head, so on this basis it
      is not permissible to make these pieces. 
Selling
      and buying pictures of animate beings is not permitted, because it was
      reported that the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah
      be upon him) said:
“Allaah
      and His Messenger have forbidden the sale of alcohol, dead meat, pork and
      idols.” (Agreed upon. Al-Bukhaari, 3/43; Muslim, 3/1207).
This
      prohibition exists also because it may lead to exaggerated ideas about
      those who are represented in the pictures, as happened in the case of the
      people of Nooh. In Saheeh al-Imaam al-Bukhaari, it is reported that
      concerning the aayah (interpretation of the meaning), “And
      they have said: ‘You shall not leave your gods, nor shall you leave
      Wadd, nor Suwaa‘, nor Yaghooth, nor Ya‘ooq nor Nasr’” [Nooh
      71:23],
      Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “These were the
      names of righteous people among the people of Nooh. When they died, the
      Shaytaan inspired their people to set up stone altars in the places where
      they used to sit, and these were named after them. So they did this, but
      they did not worship them. But when that generation died and knowledge was
      lost, the worship of these people began.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6/73). And
      there are many other texts which also forbid making and using images of
      living beings.
This
      applies to anything that is in the form of an animate creature. With
      regard to items on which there are pictures of animate beings, whether
      those items are made of gold, silver, paper, fabric or are tools, if they
      are circulated among people in order to be hung on walls etc. in a manner
      which is not considered disrespectful, then it is haraam to deal in them,
      because of the comprehensive nature of the evidence which states that
      making images is haraam. But if the item on which there is an image is to
      be used in a manner that implies disrespect, such as a tool used for
      cutting, a carpet that will be stepped on, a pillow that will be slept on,
      etc., then this is permissible, because of the report narrated in al-Saheehayn
      from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her), in which she said
      that she hung up a curtain on which there were images, and the Messenger
      of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) tore it down.
      She said: I cut it up and made two pillows out of it, and he used to
      recline upon them. According to a version narrated by Ahmad: I cut it up
      and made two cushions out of it, and I saw him reclining on one of them
      and there was an image on it. (al-Bukhaari,6/103,
      214, 247; Muslim,3/1168-1169, no. 2107).
      We should note that making images of animate beings is haraam and such
      images should not be used in crafts, on clothing or in anything else,
      because of the evidence referred to above. 
Fifthly:
      it is not permissible to make jewellery that bears the symbols of kufr,
      such as crosses and stars of David. It is not permissible to buy or sell
      such items. 
Sixthly: it is not permissible to sell gold rings
      which are made specifically for men if they are going to wear them. The
      shopkeepers’ comments that they will not sell them to Muslims is no
      excuse, because they are in a Muslim country, and whoever lives in a
      Muslim country should not deal in anything except that which has been
      permitted by the pure sharee’ah of Islam. This argument is like the
      argument of the one who sells alcohol and says that he will only sell it
      to the kuffaar, because gold rings are haraam for men.","Fataawaa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 13/67-69-73"

May Allah bestow abundant mercy on the women who cover their faces with niqaab. Perhaps your question is based on keenness for your religion – may Allah increase your keenness – but it is better to heed the commands of the religion, which tells women to remove the niqaab from their faces during prayer and Hajj, but especially during prayer, when it is not permissible to cover the face at all except if there are non-mahram men present. During Hajj it is permissible for women to lower the veil over their faces provided that it does not cling to their faces; this is what is called the burqa’. It is not permissible for the woman in ihram to wear it, but it is permissible for her to lower over her face a cover which comes down from her head over her face. If the burqa’ is not available, and there are men present who should not see the woman’s face, then it is permissible for her to wear the niqaab. 
It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “A man stood up and said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, what kind of clothes do you command us to wear during ihram?’ The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Do not wear a shirt or pants or a turban or a burnous. If one of you does not have any sandals then let him wear the khuffayn (leather slippers) and cut them so that they come below the ankle. Do not wear anything that has been dyed with saffron or turmeric. Women in ihram should not wear niqaab or gloves.”
(Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1468; Muslim, 1177). 
2 – With regard to lowering a cover over the face other than the niqaab, or for fear of being seen by non-mahram men, it has been reported in saheeh reports that some of the Sahaabiyyaat (women of the Sahaabah) did that: 
It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah said: “We used to go out with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when we were in ihram. If we met the riders we would lower our garments over our faces.
(Narrated by Abu Dawood, 1833; Ibn Maajah, 2935) 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: 
It is not narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade the woman in ihram to cover her face; rather he forbade the niqaab only because it is worn on the face. He differentiated between the niqaab and covering the face. Based on this, if a woman in ihram covers her face, we say there is nothing wrong with that, but it is better for her to uncover it so long as there are no non-mahram men around her, in which case she should cover her face from them. Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 7/153 
3 – With regard to the past and the Hajj that you did in the manner you describe, there is no sin on you because you were unaware. If a person does something that is not allowed during ihram because he was unaware or he forgot, there is no sin on him, and he does not have to offer any fidyah (ransom). 
It was narrated from Ya’la ibn Umayyah (may Allah be pleased with him) that a man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he was in al-Ji’raanah and entered ihram for ‘Umrah. The man had dyed his beard and hair with saffron, and he was wearing a jubbah (cloak). He said, “Take off your jubbah and wash off your saffron, and whatever you do in your Hajj, do in your ‘Umrah.”
(Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1697; Muslim, 1180). 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: 
Similar to forgetting are cases where one is unaware or is forced to do something, i.e., if a person forgets and puts on ordinary clothes when he is in ihram, there is no sin on him, but when he remembers, he has to take them off and put on the izaar and rida’ (ihram garments). The same applies to perfume; if he puts on perfume, forgetting that he is in ihram, there is no sin on him, but when he remembers, he must hasten to wash it off.
