13610,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13610,Allaah decrees disasters for children – why?,"I have my friend non-muslim, i was traying to help her to know the real religion in front of Allah, one of the question she asked me is this  ""I understand the belief that God is testing, to use your example, the one mother who put her child in a dust bin because she didn't want it and she miserably failed her test of love. And the woman who had so much love and desire to have a child stole one in order to fulfill her desire. She failed her test too because of the wrong way she got a child. I am not questioning the adults who did wrong. I am questioning the rationale pertaining to the children. In other words, was God testing the little baby by allowing his mother to dump him in a dust bin? What type of test is this? Is a child whose parent physically harms it being tested? What type of test is that? What is the child supposed to be tested for? How much pain it can withstand? So, my question pertains to the innocent -- not to the guilty. Why would God allow such innocents to be harmed worldwide?? I don't understand that""?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Who is praised in all languages, worshipped at all times, Whose knowledge encompasses all places, and Whose attention is never distracted from anything. Glorified be He above having any peer or rival, and exalted be He above having any wife or child. His ruling applies to all His slaves. 
“There is nothing like Him, and He is the All‑Hearer, the All‑Seer”
[al-Shoora 42:11 – interpretation of the meaning]
And blessings and peace be upon the one who was sent as a mercy to the worlds and as proof for all of mankind. He conveyed the message and fulfilled the trust, and strove for the sake of Allah in the truest sense, until he left us with a clear path whose night is as clear as its day, and no one deviates from it but he is doomed… 
We must note that anyone who believes in the existence of Allah and that He is the Lord and Creator, even if this believer in the existence of Allah is not a Muslim, knows that this Lord is distinct from His creation in all aspects. There is no room for likening or comparing Him to His creation. Hence Allah says: 
“There is nothing like Him, and He is the All‑Hearer, the All‑Seer”
[al-Shoora 42:11 – interpretation of the meaning]
If the owner of an item in this world can dispose of it however he wishes without any person bringing him to account for that because it is his property, then Allah the Creator – like unto Whom there is none – may dispose of His “property” however He wills. We Muslims have certain faith that our Lord Who created us has the utmost wisdom which cannot suffer the slightest shortcoming whatsoever. Rather everyone who believes in the existence of the Lord and accepts Him as his Lord must believe this, otherwise he is believing in an imperfect Lord, and the one who has the least reason and faith knows that there can be no Lord Who is not perfect in every sense and far removed from any imperfection.  Otherwise he is not a Lord in any real sense. We in turn, because we are part of the creation of Allah, cannot comprehend any part of His wisdom unless He tells us of it. What He has taught of the reasons behind His actions, we understand and accept; what He has concealed from us and kept the knowledge thereof to Himself, we believe in it and we know that He does not do anything unless there is great wisdom behind it, because He is the All-Wise and All-Knowing. It should never, under any circumstances, cross our minds to think that we can bring Him to account for what He does in His dominion and creation, otherwise we will be transgressing upon the preserve of Lordship and overstepping the mark, if we claim that we can know what He knows. No one can utter such words except a heretic who does not believe in the existence of a Lord in the first place. We seek refuge with Allah from that. 
If we accept the words of human specialists when they are dealing with their specialties, and we do not argue with them – such as doctors, engineers, etc. – because our educational level does not enable us to understand everything that they know, then it is even more appropriate that we should accept that however the All-Knowing, from Whose knowledge nothing is hidden, deals with the affairs of His creation is undoubtedly correct and wise. 
We humans sometimes think that it is wise to do some things that we dislike, because there is some benefit in that for us, and if we did not do them we would be accused of being lacking in wisdom and reason. For example, if a person is sick and there is the fear that he may die, but it is known that he may be cured – by Allah’s leave – if he takes a certain medicine, then the wise thing for him to do is to take that medicine even if it is bitter; if he fails to take it, that is regarded as a shortcoming and lack of reason on his part. There are many things that we do in life that we dislike, because of the benefits that they bring to us. 
For Allah is the highest description (cf. al-Nahl 16:60), and there is no way that He can be compared to His creation. He allows some things to happen in His dominion that He hates, because they serve a greater wisdom which we, or most of us, cannot comprehend.  Some of His wisdom may become clear to us, and that is by the mercy of Allah towards His believing slaves, as He shows them some of His wisdom in this world so that they might find peace of mind. For example, if we want to ask about the reasons for something we could understand, such as why Allah creates a child then causes him to die, perhaps if that child lived he would have committed major sins such as those that doom a person to Hell, and that would have condemned him to remain in Hell for eternity, or for a very long time, or he may have caused others such as his parents to deviate from the path of Allah – as mentioned in the story of the boy whom al-Khidr killed, as told in the story of al-Khidr and Moosa in Soorat al-Kahf. 
Alternatively, if this child lives he may face such difficulties that in his case death is a mercy from Allah. 
Moreover, if Allah creates him handicapped, perhaps this handicap will prevent him from committing many sins which, if he did them, would lead to his being punished on the Day of Resurrection. 
Not every sickness or handicap is necessarily a punishment; rather it may be a test for the child’s parents, by which Allah will expiate for their bad deeds, or raise their status in Paradise if they bear this trial with patience. Then if the child grows up, the test will also include him, and if he bears it with patience and faith, then Allah has prepared for the patient a reward that cannot be enumerated. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Only those who are patient shall receive their reward in full, without reckoning” [al-Zumar 39:10] 
For us Muslims, life does not end when we die, rather we believe that beyond death there is Paradise and Hell, in which is true life.  Those who did good will find the reward for the good deeds that they did in this world, waiting for them with Allah, and those who did evil will find the punishment for their evil deeds waiting for them. Good and evil cannot be equal, and the patience of the one who was tested and bore it with patience will not be wasted with Allah. Indeed, those who were not tested in this world may wish that they had suffered similar calamities when they see the high status attained by those who bore calamities with patience. There is a great deal of evidence to this effect in the Qur’aan and Sunnah, for example: 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And certainly, We shall test you with something of fear, hunger, loss of wealth, lives and fruits, but give glad tidings to As‑ Saabiroon (the patient)” [al-Baqarah 2:155] 
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “How wonderful is the affair of the believer, for all of it is good, and that applies to no one except the believer. If something good happens to him he gives thanks, and that is good for him, and if something bad befalls him he bears it with patience, and that is good for him.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2999). 
From this it should be clear to you that the calamities that befall those who seem to us to be innocent, and indeed happen to all people, are not necessarily a punishment, rather they may be mercy from Allah, but our minds and reason are imperfect and are often unable to understand the wisdom of Allah in such matters. Either we believe that Allah is more just than us, and more wise, and more merciful towards His creation, so we submit to Him and accept (His will), whilst also acknowledging our inability to understand the true nature of our own selves; or we boast of our imperfect reason and feel proud of our weak selves and insist on calling Allah to account and objecting to His decree. Such thoughts can never cross the mind of anyone who believes in the existence of a wise Lord, Creator and Sovereign Who is perfect in all ways. 
If we do that then we have exposed ourselves to the wrath and vengeance of Allah, but nothing can ever harm Allah. 
Allah drew attention to this when He said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“He cannot be questioned as to what He does, while they will be questioned” [al-Anbiya’ 21:23] 
A sign of man’s weakness and shortsightedness, is that he focuses on the calamities without paying any attention to the benefits they may bring, and not looking at other blessings that he enjoys and sees around him. For Allah has blessed mankind in ways that do not compare with the calamities that may befall them. If there was a man who does a lot of good but occasionally does not do good, then forgetting the good things that he does would be regarded as ingratitude and denial. So how about when this is our attitude towards Allah, to Whom belongs the highest description, and all of Whose dealings with His creation are good and cannot be bad in any way?
 Moreover, the Prophets and Messengers are the most beloved of creation to Allah, yet despite that they are the most severely tested of mankind and suffer the most calamities – why? It is not a punishment for them and it is not because of their insignificance before their Lord. Rather it is because Allah loves them and has stored for them a perfect reward which they will enjoy in Paradise, and He has decreed that these calamities should befall them so that He might raise them in status. He does whatever He wills, however He wills, whenever He wills; none can put back His judgement, none can repel His command and He is All-Wise, All-Knowing. And Allah is Most High, Most Knowledgeable and Most Wise.

13611,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13611,Backbiting about Non-Muslims,Please inform us if the gheebah (backbiting) is the same for non-believers as it is for Muslims.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly, it is not a Muslim characteristic to speak rudely. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The Muslim does not slander, curse, speak obscenely or speak rudely.” [al-Tirmidhi]. Whoever does a thing a lot, it will become his habit, so the Muslim should keep away from all the ways that lead to evil, whether minor or major. Whoever drives his sheep near the enclosure of the king is bound to cross the line. 
Secondly, if your question is referring to backbiting about a kafir (non-Muslim) by mentioning his physical defects, such as his having a long nose or a big mouth, etc., then do not do this, because this is making fun of the creation of Allah. If it means talking about his bad characteristics which he flaunts openly, such as zina (adultery) and immorality, or drinking alcohol, and warning against him, there is nothing wrong with that. There follow some of the comments of the scholars on this topic:
 Zakariya al-Ansari said: “Backbiting about a kafir is haram (impermissible) if he is a dhimmi [a non-Muslim living under Islamic rule], because that puts them off from accepting the jizyah (type of tax) and it is going against the treaty of dhimmah (agreement between non-Muslim subjects and the Islamic state) and the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). ‘Whoever makes a snide comment to a dhimmi has earned Hell.’ [Ibn Hibbaan in his Saheeh]. It is permissible (to backbite about a kafir) if he is a harbi (one who is at war with the Muslims), because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to command Hassan to lampoon the mushrikeen (pagans).”
(Asna al-Mutaalib ma’a Hashiyatihi, vol. 3, p. 116)
 Ahmad ibn Hajar al-Haythami said in al-Zawajir ‘an Iqtiraf al-Kabair: “Al-Ghazali was asked about backbiting about a kafir. He said: with regard to a Muslim, it is forbidden for three reasons: causing offence; criticizing the creation of Allah, for Allah is the Creator of the deeds of His slaves; and wasting time in something that is of no benefit. The first is haram, the second is makrooh (disliked), and the third is not the best thing that one can do. With regard to the dhimmi, he is like the Muslim as far as not harming him is concerned, because the Lawgiver protects his honour, blood and property. It was said in al-Khadim, the first view is correct. Ibn Hibban narrated in his Saheeh that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ‘Whoever makes a snide comment to a Jew or a Christian deserves Hell.’ The meaning of making a snide comment is to make someone hear something that will cause offence to him. There is no stronger evidence than this, i.e., it is haram. Al-Ghazaali said: with regard to the harbi, the former is not haram, and the second and third are makrooh. With regard to one who commits bid’ah (innovation), if he becomes a kafir thereby, then he is like a harbi, otherwise he is like a Muslim, but speaking of him with regard to his bid’ah is not makrooh. Ibn al-Mundhir said, concerning the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “It is your mentioning about your brother that which he dislikes,” – this indicates that in the case of one who is not your brother, such as a Jew or a Christian or a follower of any other religion, or one whose bid’ah has put him beyond the pale of Islam, there is no backbiting in his case.” .

Can one apply any creams on the face or body while fasting ?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Taraaweeh prayer is prescribed for men in congregation in the mosque at night in Ramadaan, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever stands with the imams until he finishes, it will be written for him as if he spent the whole night in prayer.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 806; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan al-Tirmidhi)
 Nevertheless, if a man prays Taraaweeh at home, there is no sin on him and his prayer is valid. At times other than Ramadaan, it is prescribed for a man to pray qiyaam al-layl at home.
With regard to women, it is better for them to pray at home, but if a woman wants to pray in the mosque, she should not be prevented from doing so, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not prevent your women from coming to the mosques, but their houses are better for them.” (Narrated by Abu Dawood, 567; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani).
 And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not prevent the slave women of Allah from coming to the mosques of Allah.” (Agreed upon; al-Bukhaari, 900; Muslim, 442).
With regard to putting cream on the face and body, there is nothing wrong with that. See Question # 2299.

13618,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13618,Ruling on doing tayammum when water is available,What is the ruling on doing tayammum when there is water available?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about one who does tayammum when there is water available. He said: This is a great evil for which he must be rebuked, because doing wudu for prayer is one of the conditions of prayer being valid, when water is available. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“O you who believe! When you intend to offer As-Salah (the prayer), wash your faces and your hands (forearms) up to the elbows, rub (by passing wet hands over) your heads, and (wash) your feet up to the ankles. If you are in a state of Janaaba (i.e. after a sexual discharge), purify yourselves (bathe your whole body). But if you are ill or on a journey, or any of you comes after answering the call of nature, or you have been in contact with women (i.e. sexual intercourse), and you find no water, then perform Tayammum with clean earth and rub therewith your faces and hands” [al-Maa’idah 5:6]
In al-Saheehayn it is narrated from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that he said: “The prayer of any one of you will not be accepted if he has broken wind, until he does wudu.” Allah has permitted tayammum, which takes the place of wudu, when water is unavailable, or when one is unable to use it because of sickness, etc, because of the aayah quoted above, and because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“O you who believe! Approach not As‑Salah (the prayer) when you are in a drunken state until you know (the meaning) of what you utter, nor when you are in a state of Janaaba (i.e. in a state of sexual impurity and have not yet taken a bath), except when travelling on the road (without enough water, or just passing through a mosque), till you wash your whole body. And if you are ill, or on a journey, or one of you comes after answering the call of nature, or you have been in contact with women (by sexual relations) and you find no water, perform Tayammum with clean earth and rub therewith your faces and hands (Tayammum). Truly, Allah is Ever Oft‑Pardoning, Oft‑Forgiving” [al-Nisa’ 4:43]
It was narrated that ‘Imraan ibn Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “We were with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) on a journey. He led the people in prayer, and there was one man who kept away. He said, ‘What kept you from praying?’ He said, ‘I have become impure (janaabah) and there is no water.’ He said, ‘You should perform tayammum with clean earth, and that is sufficient for you.’” (Agreed upon).
Hence we know that doing tayammum for prayer is not permissible when water is available and one is able to use it. Rather it is obligatory for the Muslim to use water for wudu and for doing ghusl from janaabah (major impurity following sexual activity, wet dream, etc) no matter where he is, so long as he is able to use it. He has no excuse for not doing so and for doing tayammum instead. In that case his prayer will be incorrect, because he has omitted one of the conditions of prayer, which is purifying oneself with water when one is able to do so.
Many of the Bedouin – may Allah guide them – and others who go for trips use tayammum, when there is a lot of water available and it is easy to access it. This is undoubtedly serious carelessness and an abhorrent action which is not permissible because it goes against the shar’i evidence. Rather the Muslim is excused for doing tayammum if water is far away or he has only a small amount of water which he needs to keep himself and his family, and livestock alive, and the source of water is too far away. Every Muslim, wherever he is, has to fear Allah in all his affairs; he has to adhere to His commands, which include doing wudu with water when one is able to. He must also beware of that which Allah has forbidden, which includes doing tayammum when water is available and he is able to use it. I ask Allah to give us and all the Muslims understanding of His religion and to make us all steadfast in adhering to it. May He grant us protection from the evil of our own souls and from our evil deeds, for He is Most Generous, Most Kind. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad, and his family and companions.","See Kitaab Fataawa Islamiyyah, vol. 1, p. 210"

An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “This is general and applies to both obligatory and to optional prayers offered at night and during the day. This is our view and the view of the majority. But he should not delay an obligatory prayer until the time for it is over. Al-Qadi said: Malik and a group of scholars interpreted it as referring to optional prayers done at night, because that is the usual time for sleep. 
An explanation of this is also given in another Hadith: “If anyone of you becomes drowsy whilst he is praying, let him sleep until he is refreshed, because if any one of you prays whilst he is drowsy he may not understand what he is saying and he may attempt to pray for forgiveness but may insult himself by mistake instead.” (Al-Bukhari, 212; Muslim, 786)

13628,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13628,The times when prayer is forbidden do not include wudoo’,Your preparation for prayer is like your prayer according to many hadeeths. Does this mean that it is forbidden to make ablution at sunrise/sunset/12am/12pm or is it permissible? And if one is reading a lengthy obligatory prayer· and the time for sunset/sunrise· etc. occurs· should one break the prayer and start again· or carry on? Also· if one is for example reading lengthy tarawih prayers· and they don't finish until after 12pm· do they need to make another ablution after 12pm or does it not matter as they are essentially reading the same salaat?,,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          Firstly: 
 
          It was reported in Saheeh al-Imaam Muslim that 
          ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Aamir said: “There are three times when the Messenger of 
          Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to forbid us to pray 
          or to bury our dead: when the sun begins to rise until it is fully up; 
          when the sun is at its height at midday until it passes over the meridian; 
          and when the sun draws near to setting until it sets.” (Salaat al-Musaafireen 
          wa Qasruhaa, 1373). 
 
          What is forbidden in this hadeeth is prayer and burying 
          the dead. Wudoo’ does not come under the same rulings as prayer at all, 
          because prayer means worshipping Allaah with certain words and actions, 
          starting with the takbeer and ending with the tasleem. 
 
          This is what is meant by what is forbidden in this hadeeth, 
          not wudoo’. Comparing wudoo’ with prayer in this prohibition is comparing 
          two things which are not alike, and this is incorrect. If a person speaks 
          whilst making wudoo’, this does not make his wudoo’ invalid, whereas 
          speaking invalidates one’s prayer. And there are other differences between 
          prayer and wudoo’. The point is that it is incorrect to compare wudoo’ 
          to prayer and say that it is forbidden at these times; rather it is 
          recommended (mustahabb) for a person to have wudoo’ (be taahir or pure) 
          at all times. 
 
          Secondly: 
 
          One should not stop praying an obligatory prayer if you 
          are praying and the time of sunrise or sunset is close. That is because 
          you have caught up with the prayer at the right time if you catch up 
          with one rak’ah of it in its right time. If a person is praying Fajr, 
          for example, and he makes the first rak’ah long, then he starts the 
          second rak’ah and makes it long, and the sun rises (during the second 
          rak’ah), in this case his action is OK, and he has performed the prayer 
          at the right time. But if the sun rises when he has not completed the 
          first rak’ah, then he has not prayed at the right time and he has sinned 
          by making the rak’ah too long. The same may said with regard to ‘Asr 
          and all the other prayers. 
 
          Thirdly: 
 
          If a person has wudoo’ and it has not been “broken” by 
          any of the things that nullify wudoo’, then he does not have to repeat 
          his wudoo’. It was proven that the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) prayed all five prayers 
          on the day of Conquest of Makkah with one wudoo’. 
 
          It was narrated from Sulaymaan ibn Buraydah from his 
          father that the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) prayed all the prayers on 
          the day of the Conquest of Makkah with one wudoo’, and he wiped over 
          his leather slippers (when making wudoo’). ‘Umar said to him, “You have 
          done something today that you never did before.” He said, “I did it 
          deliberately, O ‘Umar.”
 
          (Narrated by Muslim, 277) 
 
          Al-Nawawi said: 
 
          This hadeeth includes various kinds of knowledge, such 
          as: it is permissible to wipe over the socks; it is permissible to pray 
          the obligatory and naafil (supererogatory) prayers with one wudoo’, 
          so long as it is not broken, and this is permissible according to the 
          consensus of those (scholars) whose opinions carry weight. 
 
          Abu Ja’far al-Tahhaawi and Abu’l-Hasan ibn Battaal narrated 
          in Sharh Saheeh al-Bukhaari that a group of the scholars 
          said that it is obligatory to do wudoo’ for each prayer, even if one 
          already has wudoo’, basing that on the aayah (interpretation of the 
          meaning): 
 
          “When 
          you intend to offer As-Salaah (the prayer), wash your faces and your 
          hands (forearms) up to the elbows, rub (by passing wet hands over) your 
          heads, and (wash) your feet up to the ankles”
 
          [al-Maa’idah 5:6]! 
 
          I do not think that this view has been narrated with 
          a saheeh isnaad from anyone. Perhaps they meant that it is mustahabb 
          to renew one’s wudoo for every prayer. 
 
          The evidence of the majority is the saheeh ahaadeeth, 
          including this hadeeth (the hadeeth of ‘Umar). 
 
          And the hadeeth of Anas in Saheeh al-Bukhaari: 
          “The Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to do wudoo’ for every 
          prayer, but one of us would regard his (previous) wudoo’ as sufficient 
          so long as he had not broken it.” 
 
          And the hadeeth of Suwayd ibn al-Nu’maan, also in Saheeh 
          al-Bukhaari: “The Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) prayed ‘Asr, then he ate 
          saweeq, then he prayed Maghrib without doing wudoo’.” 
 
          There are many similar ahaadeeth, such as the hadeeth 
          about combining prayers in ‘Arafah and al-Muzdalifah, and on all journeys, 
          and joining the prayers which were missed on the day of al-Khandaq, 
          and so on. 
 
          What is meant by the aayah quoted above – and Allaah 
          knows best – is that if you intend to pray and you have broken your 
          wudoo’, then you should do wudoo’. And it was said that this was abrogated 
          by the actions of the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), but this view is da’eef 
          (weak). And Allaah knows best. 
 
          With regard to the words of ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased 
          with him), “You have done something today that you never did before” 
          – this clearly indicates that the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) regularly used to do wudoo’ 
          for each prayer, doing that which is best. But on this day he prayed 
          all the prayers with one wudoo’, to show that it is permissible to do 
          so, as he 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “I did it deliberately, 
          O ‘Umar.”

    But the Bounty of Allaah is immense and He is the Most 
    Merciful of those who show mercy. He is more merciful than a mother towards 
    her child. Hence repentance wipes out whatever came before. If a person 
    repents sincerely to Allaah, then Allaah will forgive him. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “O you who believe! Turn to Allaah with sincere 
    repentance! It may be that your Lord will expiate from you your sins, and 
    admit you into Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise)”

    [al-Tahreem 66:8]

    Ibn Katheer said, [the phrase] ‘it may be’ in the case of 
    Allaah means that He will definitely [do that]. 

    And it says in the hasan hadeeth which was narrated by Ibn 
    Maajah from Abu ‘Ubaydah ibn ‘Abd-Allaah from his father that he said: “The 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    ‘The one who repents from sin is like one who did not sin.’” (al-Zuhd, 
    4240; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan Ibn Maajah, no. 
    3427). Undoubtedly when the Muslim turns back to Allaah and repents to Him, 
    this is something which fills the heart with gladness. How can it be 
    otherwise, when Allaah Himself rejoices over that? It says in the hadeeth 
    which was narrated by Imaam Muslim in his Saheeh from Abu Hurayrah 
    (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “By Allaah, Allaah rejoices more 
    over the repentance of His slave than one of you who finds his lost camel in 
    the wilderness.” (Kitaab al-Tawbah, 4927). So praise Allaah for 
    helping you to repent and for guiding you to the right path. Beware of 
    returning to misguidance after having been guided. You have to remain 
    steadfast and not take lightly any forbidden thing that you did before you 
    repented.  Keep away from bad friends, and be patient and persevere in 
    doing so, because bad friends will do their utmost to hold you back and make 
    you doubt that Allaah has forgiven you. Do not pay attention to anything of 
    that kind, rather strive to draw closer to Allaah by obeying and worshipping 
    Him. Try to find alternative friends among righteous women so that they can 
    help you to follow the path of guidance. We ask Allaah to help you adhere 
    firmly to His religion and His way.

13632,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13632,"Division of inheritance among a mother, father and four brothers","A person died, leaving behind a mother, father and four brothers. How should the inheritance be divided?",,,"Praise be to Allah.There are two views concerning this matter 
          among the scholars.  
The first view:  
This is the view of the majority, and is the 
          correct view among the Hanbali madhhab. This view states that if there 
          are two parents and a number of siblings, the mother gets one-sixth 
          and the rest goes to the father, because of the words of Allaah (interpretation 
          of the meaning):  
“… if the deceased left brothers 
          or (sisters), the mother has a sixth…” [al-Nisaa’ 
          4:11]  
The general meaning 
          of the aayah indicates that the presence of siblings reduces the mother’s 
          share from one-third to one-sixth, whether they inherit or not.  
          
Al-Ramli, who was a Shaafa’i, said: “Know 
          that for a person to be able to prevent another person from inheriting 
          or reduce his share, he should himself be allowed to inherit. Whoever 
          does not inherit for a reason that may be mentioned later cannot prevent 
          anyone from inheriting altogether or decrease the amount he inherits, 
          except in a case such as when brothers are prevented from inheriting 
          by the presence of the father, but the mother’s share is reduced from 
          one-third to one-sixth because of their presence; and when her two children 
          are prevented from inheriting by the presence of their grandfather but 
          their presence reduces the mother’s share to one-sixth; and when there 
          are a husband, a full sister, a mother and a brother from the father’s 
          side, the brother has no share even though when combined with a full 
          sister this reduces the mother’s share to one-sixth.” 
Nihaayat al-Muhtaaj Sharh al-Minhaaj, part 6, 
          p. 16  
The view 
          of the Maalikis is: “Everyone who cannot inherit anyway cannot prevent 
          an heir from inheriting or reduce his share” – except in five cases… 
          the second of which is: parents and siblings, where the mother’s share 
          is reduced to one-sixth and they (siblings) cannot inherit because they 
          are prevented from doing so by the father.
See Haashiyat al-‘Adawi, part 2, p. 388  
          
The second view: 
That she gets one-third 
          along with the brothers whose share is reduced because of the presence 
          of the father. This is the view of some later scholars and it was the 
          view selected by Shaykh al-Islam Taqiy al-Deen Ibn Taymiyyah, but the 
          rest of the scholars differ from him.  
Their point is that the siblings do not reduce 
          the mother’s share to one-sixth unless they have the right to inherit 
          – so that they would benefit from reducing the mother’s share. The evidence 
          for this is the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):  
“… if the deceased left brothers or (sisters), the 
          mother has a sixth…” [al-Nisaa’ 4:11]  
where the father is not mentioned. The ruling 
          here refers to when the mother is on her own with siblings; after the 
          mother is given one-sixth, the rest is to be given to them. Among the 
          contemporary Hanbalis, this view was favoured by Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan 
          ibn Naasir al-Sa’di, when he said: “The correct view is that the brothers 
          who are prevented from inheriting or whose share is reduced do not prevent 
          the mother from inheriting one-third, because Allaah says (interpretation 
          of the meaning): ‘…if the deceased left brothers or (sisters)…’, 
          meaning heirs. As these brothers who are inheriting are not described 
          as being prevented from inheriting, so none of them can be prevented, 
          because the ruling on the division of inheritance is that the one who 
          does not inherit cannot prevent another from inheriting whether in whole 
          or in part. The reason for reducing the share of the mother is so that 
          they can have a share, but if they are not heirs they cannot prevent 
          anyone else from inheriting.  And Allaah knows best.  
See al-Tahqeeqaat al-Maradiyyah by 
          al-Fawzaan, p. 87-88  
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have 
          mercy on him) said:  
Siblings cannot reduce the mother’s share 
          from one-third to one-sixth except if they are heirs, whose share is 
          not prevented by the presence of the father. In the case where there 
          are two parents or two brothers, the mother’s share is one third. The 
          presence of the grandfather prevents the brothers from inheriting, thus 
          the brothers could not reduce the share of the mother because they themselves 
          are prevented from inheriting, according to scholarly consensus. The 
          same applies with regard to parents or the father. This was narrated 
          from Imaam Ahmad and was the view selected by some of his companions, 
          and this was the view of Abu Bakr and others among the Sahaabah (may 
          Allaah be pleased with them). 
See al-Fataawa al-Kubra, part 5, p. 446

It 
          is clear that image-making is one of the blameworthy actions of the 
          jaahiliyyah which Islam came to oppose. It is well established from 
          clear, saheeh mutawaatir ahaadeeth that it is not allowed, and that 
          the one who does this is cursed and is warned of torment in Hell, as 
          in the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas which is attributed to the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Every image maker will 
          be in Hell, and a soul will be given to every image which he made so 
          that it might torment him in Hell.” (Narrated by Muslim).
  This 
          applies to all images of animate created beings, humans and others. 
          There is no difference between three-dimensional and other images, whether 
          they were taken with cameras or produced by painting, engraving or other 
          methods, because of the general meaning of the ahaadeeth. 
 Whoever 
          claims that photographs are not included in the general prohibition 
          or that the prohibition applies only to three-dimensional images and 
          those that cast a shadow is making a false claim, because the ahaadeeth 
          concerning that are general in meaning. There is no differentiation 
          between one kind of image and another. The scholars have clearly stated 
          that the prohibition applies to photographs and other kinds of pictures, 
          such as Imaam al-Nawawi, al-Haafiz ibn Hajar and others. The hadeeth 
          of ‘Aa’ishah concerning the story of the curtain is clear, and what 
          it indicates is that an image which is on a curtain is not three dimensional, 
          rather it is a kind of drawing on cloth, but despite that the Messenger 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) counted it as trying to 
          match the creation of Allaah.
  But 
          if the image is originally incomplete, such as a head-and-shoulders 
          picture, etc., and there is removed from the picture that without which 
          is could not live, then it may be understood from the comments of many 
          of the fuqahaa’ that this is permissible, especially if there is a need 
          for such partial pictures. Whatever the case, one has to fear Allaah 
          as much as one can, and avoid that which Allaah and His Messenger have 
          forbidden. 
 “And 
          whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way

          has forbidden aggression against people’s property and taking it unlawfully. 
          He has prescribed that whatever is destroyed unlawfully is to be replaced, 
          even if it is destroyed by mistake. Whoever destroys the property of 
          another person which was sacred (i.e., protected by sharee’ah), and 
          destroys it without the owner’s permission, is obliged to replace it. 
 Imaam 
          al-Muwaffaq said: “We do not know of any dispute concerning this matter. 
          It is the same regardless of whether that was done deliberately or by 
          mistake, and whether (the person who destroyed it) was told by someone 
          else to do it or not. The same applies if he causes it to be destroyed, 
          such as if he opens a door and causes something which was locked up 
          to be lost, or he tilts a vessel and allows what is inside it to flow 
          out and be lost – he is obliged to replace it. The same applies if he 
          loosens the reins of an animal or ties it up, and it gets lost or dies 
          – he has to replace it. The same applies if he ties up an animal in 
          a narrow street, resulting in a person stumbling over it and dying or 
          being injured as a result – he is responsible for that because he transgressed 
          the limits by tying it up in a narrow street. The same applies if he 
          stops his car in the street resulting in another car or a person hitting 
          it, causing harm – he is responsible because of the report narrated 
          by al-Daaraqutni and others, which says that whoever makes an animal 
          stop in the way of the Muslims or in one of their marketplaces, and 
          it steps with its front or back leg on something  – he is responsible. 
          The same applies if he leaves a pile of mud or some wood or rocks in 
          the street, or he digs a hole and that results in a passer-by being 
          killed or injured, or he throws a melon rind or similar thing into the 
          street, or spills water and someone else slips on it and is killed or 
          injured, the one who did that in all cases is responsible, because by 
          doing that he was transgressing.  How lightly these matters are 
          taken nowadays. How often holes are dug in the streets and the way is 
          blocked, and they put obstacles in the roads, and how much harm and 
          damage results from these actions, without anyone watching over such 
          matters and putting them right, to the extent that a person may take 
          over the entire road and use it for his own purposes, annoying and causing 
          harm to passers-by, and not caring at all that he may be sinning by 
          doing that. Another of the cases in which a person is held to be responsible 
          is if he keeps a vicious dog and it attacks a passer-by or kills someone 
          – he is held to be responsible because by keeping this dog he was transgressing.  
          If he digs a well in his courtyard for his own purposes he is held to 
          be responsible for any harm that this may cause, because he is obliged 
          to maintain it in a manner that does not harm passers-by. If he leaves 
          it without taking proper care of it, then he is transgressing. If he 
          has livestock he has to take proper care of them at night to prevent 
          them from damaging people’s crops; if he leaves them and they do damage 
          someone’s crops, he is held to be responsible for that, because the 
          Prophet  
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon them) decreed that people who 
          have property must take care of it during the day, and whatever is damaged 
          at night, they must be compensated for that.” (Narrated by Ahmad, Abu 
          Dawood and Ibn Maajah). So the owner of an animal is not held to be 
          responsible any damage that was done during the day, unless he sent 
          the animal near a place where it could do damage. Imaam al-Baghawi (may 
          Allaah have mercy on him) said: “The scholars said that whatever is 
          destroyed at night, the owner (of the animal) is held to be responsible 
          for that, because customarily the owners of gardens and orchards guard 
          them during the day, and the owners of livestock guard them at night, 
          so whoever goes against that practice has gone against what is customary. 
          This applies if the owner of the animals is not with them; if he is 
          with them then he is held to be responsible for whatever damage they 
          did.” 
 Allaah 
          mentioned the story of Dawood and Sulaymaan concerning this matter, 
          as He said (interpretation of the meaning): 
 
          “And (remember) Dawood (David) and Sulaymaan (Solomon), 
          when they gave judgement in the case of the field in which the sheep 
          of certain people had pastured at night; and We were witness to their 
          judgement.
 
          And We made Sulaymaan (Solomon) to understand (the case); 
          and to each of them We gave Hukm (right judgement of the affairs and 
          Prophethood) and knowledge…”
 
          [al-Anbiya’ 21:78]
 Shaykh 
          al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “The text 
          of the Qur’aan praised Sulaymaan for his understanding that compensation 
          meant replacing it with something similar. Pasturing the sheep at night 
          means taking them out to graze at night, which took place in a vineyard. 
          Dawood ruled that the value of what had been destroyed should be paid 
          in compensation. He thought that the sheep were equal in value to the 
          destroyed crops, and he wanted to give them to the owner of the cultivated 
          field. But Sulaymaan ruled that the owners of the sheep were obliged 
          to pay compensation, and that they should repay in kind, by tending 
          the field until it was restored to its former state. He also took into 
          account the benefits that would be lost whilst the field was being restored, 
          so he ruled that the owners of the garden were to be given the livestock 
          and that they could take what the produced until it was equivalent to 
          the produce of the garden. They could benefit from the produce of the 
          sheep in place of the produce of the garden which they had lost. He 
          found that what the sheep produced during this period would be equivalent 
          to what the garden would have produced. This is the knowledge which 
          Allaah gave exclusively to Sulaymaan and for which He praised him.” 
 If 
          the animal is under the control of a rider or of a person who is leading 
          it or driving it, then he is responsible for any damage that it may 
          cause with its front legs or mouth, but not for any damage that it may 
          cause with its back legs, because of the hadeeth, “There is no compensation 
          for the back legs.” According to the report of Abu Hurayrah, (the hadeeth 
          is), “There is no compensation for the back legs of a dumb animal.” 
          The animal is described as dumb because it does not speak. Compensation 
          here refers to compensation for damage done by the animal. 
 Shaykh 
          al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “In the case 
          of every dumb animal – such as cattle, and sheep – there is no compensation 
          for damage done by the animal if it did it by itself (i.e., was not 
          under the control of anyone), such as if it ran away from the person 
          under whose control it was and it did some damage. No one is obliged 
          to pay any compensation, so long as it was not vicious and its owner 
          was not being negligent about restraining it at night or keeping it 
          away from the markets and gathering-places of the Muslims. More than 
          one of (of the scholars) mentioned that there is no compensation to 
          be paid if the animal had escaped and was going by itself without anyone 
          leading it or driving it, except in the case of savage animals.” 
 If 
          it attacks a human being or another animal, and the only way of warding 
          it off is by killing it, and it is killed, then there is no obligation 
          to pay compensation, because it was killed in self-defence, and defending 
          oneself is permissible. So he does not have to pay compensation for 
          the consequences and because he killed it in order to ward off its evil; 
          if he killed it in order to ward off its evil, then the attacker is 
          the one who has killed himself. 
 Shaykh 
          Taqiy al-Deen said: “He has to defend himself from the one who is attacking 
          him, and if he can only do that by killing him (the attacker), then 
          he has the right to do that, according to the consensus of the Fuqahaa’”. 
 Among 
          the items for which there is no obligation to pay compensation if they 
          are destroyed are: musical instruments; crosses; vessels for wine; books 
          of misguidance, myths and promiscuous material, because Ahmad narrated 
          from Ibn ‘Umar that the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told him to take a dagger 
          then they both went out to the market of Madeenah in which there were 
          wineskins that had been brought from Syria. (Ibn ‘Umar) tore them open 
          in the presence of the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) spilled their contents, 
          and he commanded his companions to do likewise.” This hadeeth indicates 
          that it is required to destroy them and that no compensation for that 
          is due. But their destruction must be done on the authority of the ruler 
          and under his supervision, so as to protect people’s interests and avoid 
          mischief.","From al-Mulakhkhas al-Fiqhi by Shaykh Saalih ibn Fawzan Aal Fawzaan, p. 133"

This is called chris kringle.  
This basic idea was taken on by a group of sisters last year and now they want to take this practise on this year also for the end of eid.  All that the practice consists of, is each sister randomly assigned another sister for whom she must buy a gift of a set value ($20 )

Firstly it involves celebrating this festival, which is something that is haraam according to sharee’ah, including offering gifts on this festival. 
Secondly, it involves imitating the kaafirs in these customs on the day of their celebration of that innovated festival. 
In Islam we have only Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adhaa. Any other festivals that have been innovated besides these two amount to nothing, especially if they are the religious festivals of other religions or groups that are beyond the pale of Islam.

(1)When the ayah was revealed commanding the believing women to cover (24:31) only the wives of the prophet covered themselves with a facial veil. The other Muslim women did not take steps to veil their faces.

(2)When some of the sahabah intended to propose to a women they would go and look at her without her knowledge. And of course if she had worn a facial veil they would not have been able to see her?

This topic is causing me much confusion please clarify the importance of the niqaab, I only want to do the correct thing for the sake of Allah.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
We appreciate your keenness to find out the 
    truth and follow it, and we ask Allaah to show us the truth as truth and enable us to follow it, and to show us falsehood as false and enable us 
    to avoid it. The correct view regarding this matter is that it is obligatory for women to cover all of their bodies in front of men. See question 
    no. 21134.
 Secondly: 
Your saying that “the rest of the Muslim 
    women did not cover their faces” is not correct. Rather the command to observe full hijab applied to the wives of the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his daughters and the believing women. The evidence for that is the verse in which Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O Prophet! Tell your wives and your 
    daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks (veils) all over their bodies (i.e. screen themselves completely except the eyes or 
    one eye to see the way). That will be better, that they should be known (as free respectable women) so as not to be annoyed. And Allaah is Ever 
    Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful”
[al-Ahzaab 33:59]
 And Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 
“And tell the believing women to lower 
    their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts) and not to show off their adornment 
    except only that which is apparent (like both eyes for necessity to see the way, or outer palms of hands or one eye or dress like veil, gloves, 
    headcover, apron), and to draw their veils all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms)”
[al-Noor 24:31]
The command in these two verses is general 
    and applies to all believing women. 
Al- Bukhaari narrated that ‘Aa’ishah said: 
    “May Allaah have mercy on the first Muhaajir women. When Allaah revealed the words ‘and to draw their veils all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their 
    bodies, faces, necks and bosoms)’ they tore their aprons and covered their faces with them.” See also question no.
    6991. 
Abu Dawood (4101) narrated that Umm Salamah 
    said: “When the words ‘to draw their cloaks (veils) all over their bodies’ [al-Ahzaab 33:59] were revealed, the women of the Ansaar went 
    out looking as if there were crows on their heads because of the covering.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
The Muhaajir and Ansaari women obeyed this 
    command and covered their faces. 
Thirdly: 
With regard to a man looking at the woman to 
    whom he wishes to propose marriage, this is part of the Sunnah. Abu Dawood (1783) narrated that Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah said: “The Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘When any one of you wants to propose marriage to a woman, if he can look at that 
    which will motivate him to go ahead and marry her, then let him do so.’ I proposed marriage to a girl and I used to hide myself until I saw that 
    which motivated me to go ahead and marry her, then I married her.” Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, no. 1832. In the 
    report narrated by Ibn Maajah it says that he hid in her garden to see her. 
This hadeeth indicates that the women of the Sahaabah used to 
    cover their faces, because if it had been the custom for women to uncover their faces, there would have been no need to hide, because he would 
    have been able to see her in any place if she had been uncovering her face. 
But because it was the custom for women to 
    cover their faces, he needed to hide. It is well known that if there are no non-mahram men around, a woman does not cover her face, such as when 
    she is in her house or in her garden, as in this hadeeth.

13648,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13648,Selling posters and frames of Qur’aanic verses,what is the view on people who take parts/quotes from the Qu'ran and sell them in frames/posters/books for profit? Where the profit obtained goes towards aiding an Islamic event/organisation/school/society?,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    We appreciate your keenness to acquire knowledge and ask 
    about issues having to do with calling people to Allah, because calling 
    people without knowledge of Islam may do more harm than good. 

    With regard to selling these frames and posters, the ruling 
    on selling them will become clear once you understand the ruling on hanging 
    up these items. 

    Hanging up frames and cloths containing verses from the 
    Qur’an in homes, schools, clubs, stores and businesses involves a number of 
    things that are objectionable and contrary to Islamic teaching, including 
    the following: 

    1.
    They are usually hung up for the purpose of adornment and 
    decorating walls with engravings of verses and adhkaar that are colourfully 
    adorned, and this is diverting the Qur’an from the purpose for which it was 
    revealed, which was to guide, offer beautiful exhortation, to be recited 
    regularly, and so on. The Qur’an was not revealed to adorn walls; rather it 
    was revealed to guide mankind and the jinn.

    2.
    Many people hang up these things for the purpose of 
    seeking blessing (barakah) from them, which is an innovation. The manner of 
    seeking blessing or barakah that is prescribed is by reading the Qur’an, not 
    by hanging it up or putting it on shelves and turning it into frames and 3-D 
    objects.

    3.
    That is contrary to the practice of the Prophet 
    (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and the Rightly-Guided Caliphs 
    (may Allah be pleased with them) who succeeded him. They did not do that, 
    and all good is in following them, not in introducing innovations. Rather 
    history bears witness in the lands of Andalusia, Turkey and elsewhere, that 
    adornment and making these plaques and decorations, and carving verses into 
    the walls of houses and mosques only occurs during periods of Muslim 
    weakness and decline.

    4.
    Hanging up these things is a means that leads to shirk, 
    because some people regard these frames and hangings as amulets that protect 
    the house and its occupants from evil and troubles. This is a shirki belief 
    that is haraam. The One Who actually gives protection is Allah, may He be 
    glorified and exalted, and one of the means of seeking His protection is to 
    recite Qur’an and adhkaar with humble focus and certain faith.

    5.
    Writing these things comes under the heading of using the 
    Qur’an as a means for business and earning more money. The Qur’an should be 
    protected from being subjected to such things. It is well-known that in some 
    cases, buying these frames comes under the heading of extravagance and 
    wasteful spending.

    6.
    Many of these frames are plated with gold, which makes it 
    more emphatically prohibited to use them or hang them up.

    7.
    In some cases, these frames clearly reflect tampering or 
    toying with the text, such as writing in very complex and elaborate styles 
    which do not benefit anyone, because they can hardly be read. Some of them 
    are written in the shape of a bird or a man who is prostrating, and other 
    kinds of images of animate beings, which it is prohibited to produce.

    8.
    It is exposing the verses and soorahs of the Qur’an to 
    mishandling and disrespectful treatment. For example, when moving from one 
    house to another, they are piled up with other kinds of furnishings, and 
    other things may be placed on top of them. Such things may also happen when 
    taking them down to paint the walls or clean the house. This is in addition 
    to the fact that they may be hung up in places where acts of disobedience to 
    Allah may be committed, and no attention is paid to the sanctity and 
    dignified status of the Qur’an.

    9.
    Some Muslims who fall short in a religious commitment may 
    hang them up to make them feel that they are undertaking some religious 
    matters, so as to reduce the guilt they feel, even though these things do 
    not avail them anything.

    To sum up, we should close the door to evil and follow that 
    which was the practice of the leaders of guidance in the first generations, 
    whose people the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) 
    testified are the best of the Muslims in their beliefs and all their 
    religious rulings. 

    Moreover, if someone were to say “we will never show 
    disrespect towards them, and we will never make them a mere adornment, and 
    we will never exaggerate concerning them; we only intend for them to remind 
    the people in their gatherings,” our response to that is that if we look at 
    real life, will we find that this really happens? Do the people who sit 
    there remember Allah or do they read the verses that are hanging there if 
    they happen to lift their heads and look at them? 

    Reality tells us that this does not happen; rather what 
    happens is the opposite. In how many rooms where verses are hanging up do 
    the people sitting there do the opposite of what is hanging above their 
    heads, and they tell lies, backbite, mock others, and do and say evil 
    things. Even if we assume that there are some people who may benefit from 
    it, they are very few and that does not affect the ruling on this matter. 

    The Muslims should turn to the Book of Allah, read it and act 
    upon what is in it. We ask Allah to make the Holy Qur’an the comfort and 
    light of our hearts and a means to console us in our grief and take away our 
    worries. 

    What I have said above is a summary of what is mentioned in 
    fatwas issued by the senior scholars of the current era, such as Shaykh Ibn 
    Baaz and the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas in the Kingdom (of Saudi 
    Arabia), and by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, as in the fatwa issued by the 
    Standing Committee under the leadership of Shaykh Ibn Baaz, fatwas no.
    2078 and 17659. 

    Based on the above, you should not sell these frames, because 
    by doing so you may end up committing some infractions that have been 
    mentioned by the scholars, and you may be a cause of other people falling 
    into some such things.

Why couldn’t I have intercourse with my new wife? What is the ruling on that Shaykh who is not using Qur’an to cure people from black magic (sihr)? I need your FATWA jazakum Allah khyara.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The answer is: If your old wife admitted doing this or it is definitely proven that she did it, then she has committed a great evil, indeed it is kufr (disbelief) and misguidance, because what she did was forbidden sihr (witchcraft or magic), and the one who does that is a kafir (non-Muslim), as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“They followed what the shayateen (devils) gave out (falsely of the magic) in the lifetime of Sulayman. Sulayman did not disbelieve, but the shayateen (devils) disbelieved, teaching men magic and such things that came down at Babylon to the two angels, Harut and Marut, but neither of these two (angels) taught anyone (such things) till they had said, ‘We are for trial, so disbelieve not (by learning this magic from us).’ And from these (angels) people learn that by which they cause separation between man and his wife, but they could not thus harm anyone except by Allah’s leave. And they learn that which harms them and profits them not. And indeed they knew that the buyers of it (magic) would have no share in the Hereafter. And how bad indeed was that for which they sold their own selves, if they but knew.” [2:102] 
This ayah (verse) indicates that witchcraft is kufr (disbelief) and that the one who practices it is a kafir. Those who practice witchcraft learn that which harms them and does not benefit them. One of their aims is to separate a man and wife, and they will have no chance before Allah on the Day of Resurrection – i.e., they will have no hope of salvation. According to a saheeh hadeeth (authentic narration) narrated from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), he said, “Avoid the seven things which will lead to doom.” He was asked, “What are they, O Messenger of Allah?” He said: “Associating anything with Allah; witchcraft; killing a soul whom Allah has forbidden us to kill unlawfully; consuming riba (usury, interest); consuming the orphan’s wealth; fleeing the battlefield; and slandering chaste but innocent believing women.” 
With regard to the Shaykh who gave you the remedy, it appears that he is a practitioner of witchcraft like the woman, because no one knows about actions of witchcraft except others who do the same. He is also one of the fortune-tellers and soothsayers who are known for their claims to know many matters of the unseen. The Muslim must beware of them and not believe their claims to know the unseen, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever comes to a fortune-teller and asks him about anything, his prayers will not be accepted for forty days.” [Muslim]. And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever comes to a fortune-teller or soothsayer and believes what he says has disbelieved in that which was revealed to Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).”  So you have to repent and regret what you have done, and tell the head of the organization and the head of the court about this Shaykh and your old wife, so that the court and organization will take action to deter them. 
If something like this happens to you again then ask the scholars of sharee’ah (Islamic law) to tell you of the remedy prescribed in sharee’ah. If what happened to you has now gone, then praise be to Allah, otherwise let us know so that we can tell you of the remedy prescribed in sharee’ah. May Allah bless you and us with understanding of Islam and steadfastness in our religion, and may He keep us safe from that which goes against it, for He is the Most Generous, Most Kind.

          the boy and said, “Do not allow your boys to tie up birds in order to 
          kill them, for I heard the Messenger of Allaah

          (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5195; Muslim, 1958. The version 
          narrated by Muslim says, “The Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed those who do that.”)
 
          3.It says in another hadeeth 
          which was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas that the Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Do not use anything 
          in which there is a soul as a target.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1957).
 
          Al-Nawawi said: 
 
          The Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade detaining or tying 
          up animals (for the purpose of killing them); according to another report, 
          ‘Do not take anything in which there is a soul as a target.’ The scholars 
          said that tying up animals means restraining them whilst they are still 
          alive in order to use them as targets and so on. The words ‘Do not take 
          anything in which there is a soul as a target’ means do not use living 
          animals as targets for shooting as targets made of leather and so on 
          are used. This prohibition means that doing this is haraam. Hence the 
          Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, according to the report 
          narrated by Ibn ‘Umar which follows this report: “Allaah cursed the 
          one who does that.” And because it is torturing animals, a waste of 
          their [animals’] lives, a waste of money, causing the animal to die 
          without slaughtering it in the proper Islamic manner if it is an animal 
          whose meat may be eaten, and wasting an animal from which benefit may 
          be derived in other ways if it is an animal whose meat may not be eaten.

          that it is obligatory to trim the moustache. This is what is obligatory 
          as taught and enjoined by the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). This was the example set

          to the scholars, and it is not a saheeh report from the Prophet

It is not permissible for

13661,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13661,Why should the wife obey her husband?,Why is it that when people get married the women has to do what the man says ?,,,"Praise be to Allah.What the Muslim has to do when he learns the ruling of Islam is to submit to it and believe in it even if he does not know the wisdom behind it. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“It is not for a believer, man or woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decreed a matter that they should have any option in their decision. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, he has indeed strayed into a plain error”
[al-Ahzaab 33:36]
He should be certain that there is the utmost wisdom behind all the rulings of Islam, but that wisdom may be hidden and he may not understand it. In that case he should realize that this is due to his lack of knowledge and the shortcomings of human intellect, which is not free of defects. 
When a man and a woman come together in marriage and live together, there are bound to be differences in opinion between them, and one party must have the final say in order to resolve the issue, otherwise the differences will multiply and disputes will increase. So there has to be someone in charge, otherwise the marriage will founder. 
Hence Islam made the husband the protector and maintainer of the wife and gave him the responsibility of heading the household, because he is more perfect in rational thinking than her in most cases. This means that it is obligatory for her to obey him. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means” [al-Nisaa’ 4:34] 
Among the reasons for that are the following: 
1 – Men are more able to bear this responsibility, just as women are more able than men to take care of the children and the household affairs. So each of them has his or her natural role and position. 
2 – In Islam, men are obliged to spend on their wives; the wife does not have to work or earn a living. Even if she has an independent income or she becomes rich, the husband is still obliged to spend on her as much as she needs. Because he bears the responsibility of spending, he is made the protector and maintainer of his wife and is put in charge (of the household). 
Hence we see chaos in the societies which go against that: men do not shoulder the responsibility of spending on their wives, and wives are not obliged to obey their husbands; they go out of the home whenever they want and leave the marital nest empty and neglect their children. A woman has to work hard even if that is at the expense of her house and family. 
We should also take note of the following points: 
1 – The woman will be rewarded by Allah for her obedience to her husband. 
2 – This obedience should not involve disobeying Allah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no obedience to any created being if it involves disobedience towards the Creator.” 
3 – Just as the husband has the right to be obeyed, Islam also tells him to treat his wife kindly. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And they (women) have rights (over their husbands as regards living expenses) similar (to those of their husbands) over them (as regards obedience and respect) to what is reasonable”
[al-Baqarah 2:228]
So he should not mistreat or oppress her, or issue harsh commands to her. Rather he should deal with her in a wise manner, and tell her to do things which are in her interests, his interests and the interests of the household, in a kind and gentle manner.

5. How can i learn to speak while i pray and read the quran in arabic. Aleast the basic word that i should speak during my pray.  
6. Is all the seafood is haram or halal.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
We thank you for your trust in our site, and we ask Allah to help us meet your expectations, and to bless you with strength and guidance. We also appreciate your eagerness to learn that which you do not know. This is something that is obligatory upon every Muslim, for man is not born with knowledge. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Knowledge comes by learning.” (Classed as hasan by Ibn Hajar in Fath al-Baari). Do not think that asking about things you do not know is stupid, rather it is something that is necessary and a person is to be commended for doing so.
Secondly: 
With regard to the questions that have to do with prayer, you will find under question no. 13340 a detailed answer describing the prayer and what is to be said in it. 
Thirdly: 
With regard to reciting Quran in Arabic or another language, you will find under question no. 3471 a detailed answer concerning this matter. We advise you to try hard to learn Arabic, at least Soorat al-Faatihah and the pillars and essential parts of prayer. That should be easy, either by learning it from a Muslim who knows it by heart and can read it well, or by going to a website on the Internet that has audio recordings of the Holy Quran and listening to it and memorizing it from that. 
Fourthly: 
With regard to missing prayers, one of the following two scenarios must apply: 
1 – When you miss a prayer unintentionally, for a legitimate shar’i excuse, such as forgetting or sleeping, although you are basically very keen to perform the prayer on time. In this case you are excused but you have to make it up as soon as you remember it. The evidence for that is the hadeeth narrated in Saheeh Muslim (681) which tells how the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his companions slept and missed Fajr prayer, and the Sahaabah began to ask one another, “What is the expiation (kafaarah) for what we have done by neglecting the prayer?” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said. “Sleeping does not mean that you are neglecting the prayer. Rather neglecting the prayer means not praying one prayer until the time for the next prayer comes. Whoever does that let him pray when he remembers it.” 
This does not mean that a person should sleep deliberately when a prayer is due, until he misses it, then use sleep as an excuse, or neglect a means that would help him to do the prayer, and then take that as an excuse. Rather he must make use of all the means he can, as the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did in this case, when he appointed one person to stay awake and wake them up to pray, but that person was overcome by drowsiness, so he did not wake them up. This is the case in which a person may be excused. 
2 – When you miss a prayer deliberately. This is a major sin, and it is so serious that some of the scholars stated that the one who does this is a kaafir. (as it says in Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Samaahat al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 10/374). The one who does this has to repent sincerely, according to scholarly consensus. With regard to making up the prayer, there was a difference of opinion among the scholars as to whether or not it would be accepted from him if he makes it up afterwards. Most of the scholars said that he should make it up and that his prayer is valid, although he is a sinner (i.e., if he does not repent – and Allah knows best), as Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthyameen quoted from them in al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 2/89. The view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) is that it is not valid, and that it is not prescribed for him to make it up. He said in al-Ikhtiyaaraat (34): “It is not prescribed for the one who misses a prayer deliberately to make it up, and the prayer, if he makes it up, is not valid; rather he should do a lot of voluntary (naafil) prayers. This is the view of a group among the Salaf.” One of the contemporary scholars who regarded this view as more correct is Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him); he quoted as evidence for that the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “Whoever does an action that is not in accordance with this matter of ours (i.e., Islam), will have it rejected.” (Agreed upon). 
So you must beware of this and strive to perform all the prayers on time, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Verily, As‑Salaah (the prayer) is enjoined on the believers at fixed hours”
[al-Nisa’ 4:103]
With regard to repentance, you will find a detailed answer under question no. 14289 on this website. 
With regard to meat that has been slaughtered by a non-Muslim, you will find an answer under question no. 10339.
 With regard to your question about seafood, it is all halaal in principle, because Allah say (interpretation of the meaning):
“Lawful to you is (the pursuit of) water game and its use for food — for the benefit of yourselves” [Al-Maa'idah 5:96]

Some of the scholars said that if water (pus) from wounds is a small amount, it does not invalidate wudu, but if it is a large amount then it does invalidate wudu . 
A group of scholars – including al-Shafi`i and Imam Ahmad, according to one report narrated from him, and the seven jurists – said that anything that comes out from anywhere other than the front and back passage does not invalidate wudu, whether it is a small amount or a large amount, apart from urine and feces. 
They quoted the following as evidence for that: 

The basic principle is that it does not break wudu ; whoever claims that something breaks wudu has to produce evidence.
The fact that it is pure is indicated by the Shar`i evidence, and whatever is indicated by Shar`i evidence cannot be changed except by further Shar`i evidence.

We do not go beyond that which is indicated by the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), because we worship Allah according to His Shari`ah and not according to our whims and desires.

If the imaam and the one who is following him stand to pray, they should form one row, and the imaam should not stand ahead of the one who is following him. Because the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)  took hold of Ibn ‘Abbaas by the back of his head and made him stand to his right, but it was not narrated that he made him stand a little further back. The imaam and the one who is following him are considered to form a row, and if they are considered to form a row then it is prescribed for them to make the row straight, which means that neither of them should stand to the front of the other.
See al-Sharh al-Mumti’ by Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, vol. 3, p. 10-12
Imaam Ahmad narrated in his Musnad that Ibn ‘Abbaas said: “I came to the Messenger of Allaah SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) at the end of the night and prayed behind him. He took my hand and drew me to stand in line with him, and when the Messenger of Allaah SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) turned back to his prayer, I took a step backwards. The Messenger of Allaah SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) prayed, and when he had finished his prayer, he said to me, ‘What is the matter? I made you stand in line with me, then you took a step backwards.’ I said, ‘ O Messenger of Allaah, is it right for anyone to pray in line with you when you are the Messenger of Allaah to whom Allaah has given …?’ (2902. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, no. 2590). Al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: This hadeeth contains an important point of fiqh, which is that the Sunnah is for the one who is praying with the imaam to stand to his right and in line with him, not in front of him or behind him, unlike the view of some madhhabs which say that he should stand a little way behind the imaam, so that his toes are in line with the heel of the imaam.

          ignorant friend and a secret enemy. He should advise his family to bear 
          his loss with patience and not to wail over him or to weep excessively. 
          He should advise them not to do any of the bid’ahs (innovations) that

13685,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13685,He hears music sometimes in school without wanting to; is that a sin?,"I have previously stopped listening to music, by me not putting it on, but I hear it at school and other places, where I try not to enjoy it but sometimes I do?

Would that count as listening, and would I be accounted for it or not?",,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          There is a difference between the one who listens to 
          music and the one who hears it. The one who listens to songs hears them 
          deliberately, wants to hear them and enjoys that, whereas the one who 
          only hears the sound that reaches him, without wanting or intending 
          to do so, such as when riding in an airplane or a bus in which there 
          is music, or who goes to the marketplace and hears that from some stores 
          without wanting or intending to listen to it. There is a difference 
          between the latter and the one who sits down to listen to and enjoy 
          this haraam thing. 
 
          Hence Shaykh al-Islam (Ibn Taymiyah) said: The command and the prohibition 
          have to do with listening. Merely hearing something is like seeing; 
          it has to do with the intention behind seeing, not what happens without 
          a person choosing it…. The same applies to committing sin through the 
          five senses of hearing, sight, smell, taste and touch; the commands 
          and prohibitions are connected to what a person intends and does, but 
          whatever happens without him choosing it, there is no command or prohibition 
          with regard to that.
 
          (Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, part 5, p. 566) 
 
          One has to denounce that evil as much as possible, but 
          if he cannot do that, then he should denounce it in his heart. One of 
          the things implied by denouncing it in one’s heart is not remaining 
          in a gathering or a place where that evil is happening, if one is able 
          to leave. 
 
          With regard to listening to it, one must strive against 
          that as much as possible and seek refuge with Allaah from the Shaytaan, 
          and remember Allaah. Then Allaah will take that away from you. If that 
          makes your heart attracted to it, then you should keep away from those 
          parts of the school. If it will not cause you a lot of trouble to miss 
          some of those classes in which these things happen then you should not 
          attend them. You have to remember that Allaah is always watching and 
          fear Him, for whoever fears Allaah, Allaah will give him a way out. 
          Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
 
          “And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to 
          Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty)”

Note that Allah mentions this dog in His Book, and says that he was stretching forth his two forelegs at the entrance to the Cave [al-Kahf 18:18], in the context of referring to their high status. This indicates the great benefit to be gained by keeping company with righteous people. Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on this aayah: 
“Their dog was included in their blessing, so he slept as they slept in that situation. This is the benefit of keeping company with righteous people, so this dog was mentioned and was given status too.” 
This meaning is also indicated by the hadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah, in which he said to the one who said that he loved Allah and His Messenger, “You will be with those whom you love.” (Agreed upon, from the hadith of Anas). 
From this it may be understood that keeping company with bad people causes a great deal of harm, as Allah explained in Soorat al-Saaffaat, where He says (interpretation of the meaning):

13692,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13692,What Are the Virtues of Jumu’ah Prayer?,I would like to know some of the ahadith which speak of the virtues of Jumu`ah prayer.,Many hadiths have been narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) which explain the virtues of Jumu`ah prayer. Please see below.,,"Praise be to Allah.Many hadiths have been narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) which explain the virtues of Jumu`ah prayer. For example: 

Muslim (233) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The five daily prayers, and from one Jumu`ah to the next, are an expiation for whatever sins come in between, so long as one does not commit any major sin.” 

Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does ghusl then comes to Jumu`ah, and prays as much as Allah decrees for him, then listens attentively until the khutbah (Friday Sermon ) is over, then prays with him (the imam), will be forgiven for (his sins) between that and the next Jumu`ah and three more days.” Narrated by Muslim, 857 
Al-Nawawi said: 
“The scholars said that what is meant by his being forgiven between the two Jumu`ahs and three more days is that a good deed is worth ten like it, so he will be rewarded with ten hasanahs for each of the good deeds that he did on Friday . Some of our companions said: what is meant by what is between the two Jumu`ahs is from the Jumu`ah prayer and the khutbah until the same time on the following Friday , so that it will be seven days, no more and no less, then three days are added making ten in all.” 

Coming early to Jumu`ah brings a great reward. 

Al-Bukhari (814) and Muslim (850) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does ghusl on Friday like ghusl for major ritual impurity, then goes to the prayer (in the first hour, i.e., early), it is as if he sacrificed a camel. Whoever goes in the second hour, it is as if he sacrificed a cow; whoever goes in the third hour, it is as if he sacrificed a horned ram; whoever goes in the fourth hour, it is as if he sacrificed a hen; and whoever goes in the fifth hour it is as if he offered an egg. When the imam comes out, the angels come to listen to the khutbah.” 

If a person walks to Jumu`ah prayer, for every step he will have the reward of fasting and praying qiyam for one year. 

Aws ibn Aws al-Thaqafi narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does ghusl on Friday and causes (his wife) to do ghusl, and sets out early, and comes close to the imam and listens and keeps quiet, for every step he takes he will have the reward of fasting and praying qiyam for one year.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 496; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi, 410) 
Ibn al-Qayyim said in Zad al-Ma’ad, 1/285: 
(“Causes (his wife) to do ghusl” means has intercourse with his wife. This is how it was interpreted by Waki’.)
Al-Hafiz ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said, after quoting the hadiths which speak of the virtues of Jumu`ah prayer: 
“What we have quoted, when taken all together, indicates that the expiation of sins from one Friday to the next is subject to all the conditions mentioned above being met, namely doing ghusl, cleaning oneself, putting on perfume, wearing one's best clothes, walking in a calm and dignified manner, not stepping over people, not pushing between two people, not offending others, praying nafl prayers, listening attentively and avoiding idle speech.”
And Allah knows best.",Islam Q&A
13693,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13693,Means of expiating sin,"I am a muslim, married woman. I was born in a muslim family. But, I was not aware of islamic rules much. I did so many grave major sins that I feel like I am the worst person in this world. Now, I am trying to gain knowledge about my great religion, to obey it's rulings. But, I don't feel any peace and rest in my heart. Always I feel like how would I know that Allah rabbul alamin has forgiven me? What good deed I can do so piles of my grave sins will be wiped out? How would I get close to my Lord? O Allah, show me your mercy on me. 
I can't sleep well, I can't take rest, I don't get any joy from anything. Always I feel like I can die anythime and He will ask me questions, what I will reply HIM, I don't have anything to tell HIm. Always I am crying inside. Oh, Allah tell me how would I get free of all my sins.  
I am writing you as I have read your book ""I want to repent, but.."" several times. I get a little calm when I read Allah says, ""Despair not of the Mercy of Allaah…” [al-Zumar 39:53]. That is the only hope in my life. 
I believe you are an islamic scholar. Do you believe Allah will forgive me who is such a sinner who did all kind of sin in life. I have offered salat of repentence and I am trying to change my lifestyle in every respect only to make my Lord satisfy to me. I am commited that I will follow islamic rules in rest of my life .",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly, praise be to Allaah Who has enabled you to repent and has guided you after you were misguided, Who has lighted the way for you and has made faith dear to you and made it attractive to you. To Him be all praise at all times. 
We congratulate you on having been enabled to repent. This is a blessing for which thanks must be given, for Allaah accepts the repentance of the one who repents. Please see Question no 14289. 
Secondly, you say, “How would I know whether Allaah has forgiven me or not?” 
You should note that whoever repents sincerely, Allaah accepts his repentance and Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. He has promised the one who repents to Him that He will forgive him his sins. He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say: ‘O ‘Ibaadi (My slaves) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allaah, verily, Allaah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful’”
[al-Zumar 39:53]
When Allaah promises something, He does not break His promise. 
And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Except those who repent and believe (in Islamic Monotheism), and do righteous deeds; for those, Allaah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allaah is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful.
And whosoever repents and does righteous good deeds; then verily, he repents towards Allaah with true repentance”
[al-Furqaan 25:70-71]
In this aayah, Allaah tells us that He will replace the bad deeds of the one who repents into good deeds, and this is one of the blessings of repentance. 
Thirdly, you say, “How can I get rid of my sin?” 
This is an important matter, for these are the means by which sin is expiated. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The punishment for sin is lifted from a person by means of ten things: 
1 – Repentance; this is agreed upon among the Muslims. Allaah says (interpretation of the meanings): 
“Say: ‘O ‘Ibaadi (My slaves) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allaah, verily, Allaah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful’”
[al-Zumar 39:53]
“Know they not that Allaah accepts repentance from His slaves and takes the Sadaqaat (alms, charity), and that Allaah Alone is the One Who forgives and accepts repentance, Most Merciful?”
[al-Tawbah 9:104] 
“And He it is Who accepts repentance from His slaves, and forgives sins”[al-Shoora 42:25]
2 – Praying for forgiveness. It was narrated in al-Saheehayn that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If a person commits a sin, then says, ‘O Lord, I have committed a sin so forgive me,’ He says, ‘My slave knows that he has a Lord Who may forgive sins or punish for it; I have forgiven My slave…’” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6953; Muslim, 4953) 
In Saheeh Muslim it is narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If you did not commit sin, Allaah would do away with you and bring people who would commit sins then ask Him to forgive them, so He would forgive them.” (2749) 
3 – Doing good deeds which wipe out sins. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And perform As‑Salaah (Iqaamat‑as‑ Salaah), at the two ends of the day and in some hours of the night [i.e. the five compulsory Salaah (prayers)]. Verily, the good deeds remove the evil deeds (i.e. small sins)”[Hood 11:114]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The five daily prayers and Jumu’ah (Friday prayers) and Ramadaan take away the bad deeds between one and the next, if you avoid major sins.” (Narrated by Muslim, 344). 
And he said: “Whoever fasts Ramadaan out of faith and the hope of reward, his previous sins will be forgiven.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 37; Muslim, 1268). 
And he said: “Whoever spends the night of Laylat al-Qadr in prayer out of faith and the hope of reward, his previous sins will be forgiven.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1768). 
And he said: “Whoever performs Pilgrimage to this House, and does not behave in an obscene or immoral manner, he will go back free of sin like the day his mother gave birth to him.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1690). 
And he said: “The expiation for the fitnah caused to a man by his family, wealth and children is prayer, fasting, enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 494, Muslim, 5150). 
And he said: “Whoever frees a believing slave, for each of (the slave’s) limbs Allaah will free one of his limbs from the Fire…” (Narrated by Muslim, 2777). 
These and similar ahaadeeth are narrated in the books of Saheeh. And he said: “Charity extinguishes sin as water extinguishes fire, but hasad (malicious envy) consumes good deeds as fire consumes wood.” 
4 – The du’aa’ of the believers for the believer, such as when they pray the funeral prayer for him. It was narrated from ‘Aa’ishah and Anas ibn Maalik that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no Muslim who dies, and a group of Muslims numbering one hundred pray for him, all of them interceding for him, but their intercession for him will be accepted.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1576). 
It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas said: “I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: ‘There is no Muslim man who dies, and forty men pray the funeral prayer for him, not associating anything with Allaah, but Allaah will accept their intercession for him.’” (Narrated by Muslim, 1577). This refers to praying for him after he has died. 
5 – Good deeds which can be done for the deceased, such as giving in charity (on his behalf), etc. This will benefit him, according to the clear, saheeh texts of the Sunnah and the consensus of the Imams. The same applies to freeing slaves and Hajj (on his behalf), indeed it was proven in al-Saheehayn that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever dies owing any (obligatory) fasts, his heir should fast them on his behalf.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5210; Muslim, 4670). 
6 – The intercession of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and others on the Day of Resurrection for those who have committed sins. This is narrated in the mutawaatir ahaadeeth about intercession, such as the hadeeth in which he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “My intercession will be for those among my ummah who have committed major sins.” (Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 3965). And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “I was given the choice between admitting half of my ummah to Paradise and intercession, and I chose intercession.” (See Saheeh al-Jaami’, 3335). 
7 – Calamities by means of which Allaah expiates sins in this world. It was narrated in al-Saheehayn that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No tiredness, exhaustion, worry, grief, distress or harm befalls a believer in this world, not even a thorn that pricks him, but Allaah expiates some of his sins thereby.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5210; Muslim, 4670). 
8 – The torment, squeezing and terror that happens in the grave. These are also things by means of which sins are expiated. 
9 – The horrors, distress and hardship of the Day of Resurrection. 
10 – The mercy and forgiveness of Allaah, with no cause on the part of His slaves. 
 See: Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn Taymiyah, vol. 7, p. 487-501. 
Fourthly, you ask, “Do you think that Allaah will forgive me?” 
Yes, He will, if you have repented sincerely, for Allaah has promised to accept repentance, the evidence for which we have mentioned above.  Do not despair of Allaah’s mercy. Remember the story of the man who killed one hundred people, then he repented and Allaah accepted his repentance. This is the story as narrated by Imam Muslim in his Saheeh, in Kitaab al-Tawbah (2766): “It was narrated from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri that the Prophet of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Among the people who came before you there was a man who killed ninety-nine people, then he asked about the most knowledgeable person in the land. He was told about a monk, so he went to him and said, ‘I have killed ninety-nine people, can I repent?’ The monk said, ‘No.’ So he killed him, thus making the number one hundred. Then he asked about the most knowledgeable person in the land, and he was told about a scholar, so he (went to him and) said: ‘I have killed one hundred people. Can I repent?’ He said, ‘Yes, who could stop you from repenting? Go to such and such a land, where there are people who worship Allaah. Worship Allaah with them and do not go back to your own land, for it is a bad land.’ So he set out, and when he was halfway there, death came upon him. The angels of mercy and the angels of punishment argued over him. The angels of mercy said, ‘He was coming repentant, turning with his heart towards Allaah.’ The angels of punishment said, ‘He never did anything good.’ Then an angel came to them in human form and they accepted him as a mediator. He said, ‘Measure the distance between the two lands, and whichever he is closer to is where be belongs.’ So they measured the distance and found that he was closer to the land to which he was headed, so the angels of mercy took him.” 
We learn several things from this hadeeth, including the following: 
1 – That Allaah forgives all the sins of one who repents, no matter how great they are. This is indicated by the aayah in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say: ‘O ‘Ibaadi (My slaves) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allaah, verily, Allaah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful’”[al-Zumar 39:53]
2 – The one who repents has to keep away from bad friends who were committing the sin with him. He should keep company with righteous friends who will help him to do good and show him how to do it. We ask Allaah to help us and you and to give us all strength. And Allaah knows best. 
3 – The Muslim must live his life in a state between fear and hope, fearing his sins and not feeling safe from the Plan of Allaah, and not being certain that he will enter Paradise. For the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them), even though they were so righteous and pious, were not like this, rather they feared their Lord and worshipped Him with fear and hope. So the Muslim must obey Allaah and repent and hope for the mercy of Allaah, knowing that Allaah forgives and accepts the repentance of the one who repents to Him, so he hopes that Allaah will forgive him.  He knows that Allaah accepts and loves the righteous deeds of His slave, so he strives to do righteous deeds hoping that they will be accepted. If he lives in this state, fearing his sins and hoping for the mercy of his Lord, he will strive to worship Him and keep away from sin, asking Allaah to reward him for his righteous deeds until he meets Him when He is pleased with him, and he seeks refuge with Allaah from his heart being turned away or his situation changing, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to pray, “O Controller of the hearts, make my heart steadfast in Your religion.”
We ask Allaah to make you and us steadfast in His religion, and bestow more of His bounty upon us, for He is All-Hearing, Ever Near.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

13699,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13699,Competing to carry the bier,I notice in many Muslim funerals men rush to carry the bier and push others away. They run in from the back and those at the front move away so that many men can carry the bier. I ask them why they do this and they say the basis for this is that more people can get blessings for carrying the bier. This seems somewhat unusual because it makes it very likely that the body will actually be dropped and sometimes this indeed occurs. Is there any basis for this practice in Islam?,,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          What is narrated in saheeh reports from the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is that it is Sunnah to 
          follow the funeral. Al-Bukhaari and Muslim narrated in their Saheehs 
          from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The duties of a Muslim 
          towards his fellow Muslim are five: to return his greeting, visit him 
          when he is sick, follow his funeral, accept invitations and say ‘Yarhamuk-Allaah 
          (May Allaah have mercy on you) when he sneezes).’” 
 
          They also narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased 
          with him) that the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever attends a 
          funeral and prays over the deceased will have one qeeraat (of reward), 
          and whoever attends until the deceased is buried will have two qeeraats.” 
          He was asked, ‘What are these two qeeraats?” He said, “Like two huge 
          mountains.” 
 
          Undoubtedly whoever carries the bier or helps to carry 
          it until the deceased is buried will attain this great reward and more, 
          for even if there were no saheeh hadeeth concerning this matter, the 
          general principles of sharee’ah indicate that carrying the bier of a 
          Muslim is prescribed in Islam, because it involves treating the deceased 
          with kindness. But if that kind treatment will lead to the problem of 
          people pushing and shoving, as mentioned in the question, then warding 
          off that evil takes precedence over trying to do good.  The reward 
          of the one who hopes to gain reward by carrying the bier is not greater than the reward for the one who forsakes it out of consideration towards his Muslim brothers, and not because he is incapable of doing it.",Shaykh Sa’d al-Humayd
