All the fards and sunnahs. Please describe..",,,"Praise be to Allah.A brief summary of the requirements for the Ghusl follow. First, the Muslim should make their intentions for purification, then wash the private parts. Then make wudu like the wudu done for prayer, then pour water on his right side, then the left side. Then water should be poured on his head, covering the entire body with water. It is also reported in the sunnah that the washing the feet should be delayed until the end of the ghusl. As is reported on the authority of A'ishah (May Allah be pleased with her) who said that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when performing ghusl from janaba used to wash his hands, then wash his private parts with his left hand. After that he performed wudu like that for prayer. Next he took some water and ran his fingers in the roots of his hair until he used three handfuls of water on his head. He would then go on pouring water on the rest of his body and wash his legs. (It was reported by Muslim #479.) In the narration of Al-Bukhari it states that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) then turned aside and washed his legs.

427,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/427,Circumcision for women is not obligatory,"I would like to know more about female circumcision in Islam. I have read the 
ahadith where the Prophet told a woman how to perform it. I would like to know if 
it is optional or obligatory, and - if it is obligatory - whether there is a certain way 
to do it (what part should be cut?).",,,"Praise be to Allah.
Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said, in his book al-Mughni: ""Circumcision is obligatory for men, and it is an honour for women, but it is not obligatory for them. This is the opinion of many scholars. (Imam) Ahmad said: For men it is more strictly required, but for women it is less strictly required."" (al-Mughni 1/70).
Circumcision of the female consists of the removal of a part of the clitoris, which is situated 
above the opening of the urethra. The Sunnah is not to remove all of it, but only a part. 
(al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah 19/28).
In this matter, it is wise to follow the interests of the female: if the clitoris is large, then part of it 
should be removed, otherwise it should be left alone. This size of the clitoris will vary from 
woman to woman, and there may be differences between those from hot climates and those 
from cold climates.
A hadith on the topic of female circumcision has been attributed to the Prophet 
 (Peace 
and Blessings of Allah be upon Him), according to 
which he said: ""Circumcision is a Sunnah for men, and an honour for women,"" but there is 
some debate as to the authenticity of this hadith. See Silsilah al-Ahadith al-Da‘ifah by al-Albani, no. 
1935.
How circumcision is to be performed is mentioned in the hadith narrated by Umm ‘Atiyah, may 
Allah be pleased with her, according to which a woman used to perform circumcisions in 
Madinah. The Prophet 
 (Peace 
and Blessings of Allah be upon Him) told her: ""Do not abuse (i.e. do not go to extremes in circumcising); 
that is better for the woman and more liked by her husband."" (Reported by Abu Dawud in al-Sunan, 
Kitab al-Adab; he said this hadith is da‘if).

428,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/428,Inheritance from non-Muslims,"I am a Muslim and my parents are not. They have written in their will that whatever 
assets they have will be divided between myself, my brother and my sister (who 
are also not Muslims).
What is the Islamic ruling on inheritance for Muslims whose parents are 
non-Muslim?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
A Muslim is not permitted to inherit anything of the wealth of a non-Muslim relative, as the 
Prophet 
 (Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""The believer does not inherit from a kaafir (disbeliever) and the kaafir does not 
inherit from a believer."" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, al-Fath 4283). According to another report, he said: 
""The Muslim does not inherit from a kaafir and the kaafir does not inherit from a Muslim."" 
(al-Bukhaari, 6764). The Messenger of Allah 
 (Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon him) also said: ""People who belong to two different 
religions do not inherit from one another."" (Reported by Abu Dawud in al-Sunan, Kitab al-Faraa’id, and 
deemed hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami‘, 7614) - because when the ties of religion are cut, the ties 
of inheritance are also cut, because the former is the basis of the latter.
However, if a non-believer makes a will leaving one-third or less of his wealth to his child (son 
or daughter), one is entitled to take it, because this is a will as opposed to inheritance according 
to a non-Islamic system. This difference is well-known in Islamic fiqh.

432,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/432,"Obtaining a
    discount card in return for paying a certain amount","In some bookshops there are
      advertisements for a scheme whereby the customer pays a set amount of money each month and
      gets two things: he will be supplied with new books in a specific area of interest, such
      as fiqh, etc, and he will get a 10% discount if he wants to buy books from these stores.
      What is the ruling on this?",,,"Praise be to Allah.This is a kind of gambling, concerning which Allaah says
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Intoxicants (all kinds of alcoholic
    drinks), gambling, al-ansaab (stone altars for making sacrifices to idols, etc.) and
    al-azlaam (arrows for seeking luck or decision) are an abomination of Shaytaan’s
    handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination)…” [al-Maa’idah 5:90]
Gambling means everything that involves one side trying to take
    advantage of the other, so that one will be the winner and the other will be the loser.
    This is the shar’i ruling on gambling. So a man who pays 500 riyals every month, for
    example, may buy books for which his discount adds up to more than a thousand riyals, or
    he may not buy anything at all. If we suppose that he buys things for which the discount
    adds up to more than five hundred riyals, then he will be the winner, and the storekeeper
    will be the loser; if he does not buy anything, then the storekeeper will be the winner
    and the man will be the loser, because he paid 500 riyals and did not get anything in
    return. This transaction is a kind of gambling and is not permissible.","Liqa’ al-Baab al-Maftooh, Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 52/68"
434,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/434,The Muslim belief concerning the destiny of non-Muslim monotheists in the Hereafter,What do Muslims believe happens in the hereafter to Non-Muslims that believe in one God?,,,"Praise be to Allah.
Your interest in studying Islam is something great, which we appreciate. Everyone should seek 
the truth wherever it may be, and follow it even if it differs from the way of their forefathers or 
the religion of the country or society in which they live, because salvation from the Fire of Hell 
on the Day of Judgement is more important than anything else.
One of the most important things that the would-be student of Islam should do is to consult 
authentic Islamic references, in order to understand the reality of this religion. For example, one 
should consult translations of the meanings of the Qur’an and the ahaadeeth (sayings) of the 
Prophet of Islam, Muhammad 
 (peace be upon him), ensuring that the translations are 
sound. But reading books written by non-Muslims, or by Muslims who do not really 
understand or practice their religion, is not a scholarly approach or a sound method of finding 
out the truth.
Returning to your question, what do Muslims believe will happen to atheists? Or for that 
matter, what about monotheists who are not Muslim? Will their fate be Hell in the Hereafter? 
The answer is that Allaah has clearly created everything, sent His blessings on His creation, and 
sent Messengers and Revealed Books to tell them that whoever believes in and worships Him 
alone, not associating any partner with Him, will enter Paradise, and whoever denies Him, or 
worships something else besides Him, or takes other gods instead of Him, or says that He has 
a wife or son, or that the angels are His daughters, or follows a law other than that which He 
revealed to judge between people in truth, or turns away from His religion, will be doomed in 
the Hereafter to the eternal punishment of Hell. This is exact justice, and this will be the fate 
deserved by the one who did not give his Creator His due.
Worshipping Allaah, obeying His commands and adhering to His prohibitions are basic 
matters, but they form the essence of the relationship between the Creator and His creation. 
Allah says:
""And I (Allaah) created not the jinns and men except they should worship Me (alone)."" 
[al-Dhaariyaat 51:56]
Messengers were sent with one message: to tell their people ""Worship Allaah, for you have no 
god besides Him.""
Hence we may understand just how far short the person falls who believes that Allaah is one 
and does not associate anything with Him, but does not worship or obey Him, but rebels 
against Him and fails to follow His religion or Law, or the Revelation and Messengers which He 
sent for him and people like him. Does such a person deserve to enter Paradise or Hell?
This is the person who says: ""I believe that there is One God Who created the universe, but I 
am going to stop there; I will not pray to Him or fast or perform Hajj or pay zakaat as He 
commanded. I am not going to carry out any duties towards Him; I will follow my own desires 
and do whatever I want, whether He permitted it or forbade it."" Can such a person attain 
salvation on the Day of Judgement?
Allaah sent Messengers to every nation, that they might worship Him and shun false deities. 
The last nation is this ummah, and the last Messenger is Muhammad 
 (peace be upon 
him). Allaah sent him for the whole of mankind, the entire world, and thus abrogated the 
previous laws and made this religion the best and most perfect and complete. Hence it is 
obligatory for everyone to enter this religion, for Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
""And whoever seeks a religion other than Islaam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the 
Hereafter he will be one of the losers."" [Aal ‘Imraan 3:85]
On this basis, the fate of one who says ""I believe in the idea of One God, but I do not want to 
be a Muslim, or I do not want to follow the last Revelation or the last Prophet,"" is clear.
Furthermore, the fate of an atheist, who rejects even the belief in God, is even clearer and more 
evident.
Finally, I hope that the matter is now clearer to you. I ask Allaah to guide us all to the truth and 
help us to follow it, for He is the best Supporter and Helper.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

the next century science will conquer religion.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
The evidence that Allah is the only Creator of life may be found in many places in the Qur’an and 
Sunnah. For example:
""Blessed is He in Whose Hand is the dominion, and He is Able to do all things,
Who has created death and life, that He may test you which of you is best in deed, and He is the 
All-Mighty, the Oft-Forgiving.""[al-Mulk 67:1-2]
""Is, then, He Who creates as one who creates not?""[al-Nahl 16:17]
""Yet they have taken besides Him other gods that created nothing but are themselves created . . .""[al-Furqaan 25:3]
Allah challenged all of mankind to create even the most insignificant creature, i.e. a fly, but no one 
could do that and no one ever will. Allah says:
""O mankind! A similitude has been coined, so listen to it (carefully): verily! Those on whom you call 
besides Allah cannot create (even) a fly, even though they combine together for the purpose. And if 
the fly snatched away a thing from them, they would have no power to release it from the fly. So 
weak are (both) the seeker and the sought.""[al-Hajj 22:73]
Imam al-Bukhari reported in his Saheeh from Abu Sa‘eed (may Allah be pleased with him) that the 
Prophet 
 (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) said: ""There is no created being but Allah created it."" In Arabic, the word ""khalaqa"" 
means to make out of nothing, which is something that only Allah can do; it is impossible for anyone 
except Allah to do this. It also carries the meaning of decreeing or foreordaining. [**]
See Fath al-Bari Sharh Saheeh al-Bukhari, 13/390.
The Religion of Allah (Islam) is proud and cannot be defeated by the kaafirs’ arrogance about the 
knowledge they possess. Allah says:

""They know only the outside appearance of the life of this world, and they are heedless of the

He is, as he says, well-liked by the people at the mosque, but he knows deep down that he has shortcomings and is guilty of some sins, and does not deserve to be the imam or to have this love and respect from people. He fears that if he remains as imam of the mosque, he may become a hypocrite or show off. Should he stay in the mosque? Should he continue leading the people in prayer, or should he leave this position out of fear of becoming a hypocrite and show off?",,,"Praise be to Allah.You describe this young man as being loved by his people, but he is guilty of some transgression which is a matter between him and his Lord. I say that the fact that Allah has blessed him with the position of imam and the love of his people dictates that he should give up his sin and stop transgressing against himself, and he should worship Allah properly, and give thanks to Allah, because the fact that a person is loved by his people and is their imam is a great blessing from Allah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And the slaves of the Most Beneficient (Allah) are those who walk on the earth in humility and sedateness…
And those who say: ‘Our Lord… and make us leaders for the muttaqoon (the pious)…” [al-Furqaan 25:63-74]
Those who pray are among the pious, and the one who leads them in prayer is included in this aayah, “…and make us leaders for the muttaqoon (the pious)…” So let him praise Allah for this blessing, and stop transgressing against himself, and let him make this one of the means of bringing himself back to obedience to Allah, and let him fear Allah with regard to his status.
When he says that he is afraid he may show off, this is waswaas (insinuating thoughts) that the Shaytaan puts into a person’s mind whenever he wants to do an act of obedience to Allah. The Shaytaan comes to him and says, “You are showing off.” He has to cast this idea aside, ignore it and seek the help of Allah, for he always recites in his salaah the words, “Iyyaaka na’budu wa iyyaaka nasta’een (You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help” [al-Fatihah 1:5 – interpretation of the meaning].","Liqa’ al-Baab al-Maftooh by Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 53/77"

Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“… then marry (other) women of your choice, two or three, or four…” [al-Nisaa’ 4:3]
And this was the practice of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and of his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them), but apart from the Prophet, no one is permitted to have more than four wives.
It is well known that women are by nature jealous and reluctant to share their husband with other women. Women are not to be condemned for this jealousy, for it existed in thebest of righteous women, the Sahaabiyyaat, and even in the Mothers of the Believers [the wives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)]. But women should not let jealousy make them object to that which Allah has prescribed, and they should not try to prevent it; a wife should allow her husband to marry another woman for this is a kind of cooperating in righteousness and piety. According to a hadeeth whose authenticity is agreed upon, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever pays attention to his brother’s needs, Allah will pay attention to his needs.”
The first wife’s consent is not a prerequisite for a man to take another wife. The Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas was asked about this and replied as follows:
“It is not obligatory for the husband, if he wants to take a second wife, to have the consent of his first wife, but it is good manners and kindness to deal with her in such a manner that will reduce the hurt which women naturally feel in such situations. This is done by being kind to her and speaking to her in a gentle and pleasant manner, and by spending whatever money may be necessary in order to gain her acceptance of the situation.”
Concerning her request for divorce if her husband wants to marry another wife, this is a mistake. But they should examine the situation, and if she really cannot cope with living with another wife, then she can ask him for khula’ [ a kind of divorce instigated by the wife, whereby she forgoes the mahr]. If she can cope with living with the second wife, but it hurts her to do so, then she should be patient and seek the pleasure of Allah. Thawbaan (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:
“No woman asks her husband for a divorce for no reason, but the fragrance of Paradise is forbidden for her.” (Narrated by Abu Dawood and others, and classed as saheeh by al-Albani, may Allah have mercy on him).
If she bears it with patience, then Allah will make it easier for her and will expand her chest (i.e., grant her peace and calm), and will compensate her with something good. The husband must also help her by treating her kindly, being patient with her for any jealousy etc. on her part, and overlooking her mistakes.

female circumcision?",,,"Praise be to Allah.All Praise be to Allaah. 
    To the dear inquirer: 
We appreciate the question you have submitted, 
  as it is an issue which is truly among those which may pose a hindrance in some 
  cases for those who wish to adopt Islaam. 
In reality the issue is really simpler 
  than many may think.  Male circumcision is among the rites of Islaam and 
  is part of the fitrah, or the innate disposition and natural character 
  and instinct of the human creation, and is from the religion of Ibrahim (peace 
  be upon him).  Allaah has said (interpretation of the meaning): ""Then 
  we revealed to you (the command) to follow the pure and uncorrupted religion 
  of Ibrahim."" 
The Prophet  
  (peace be upon him) said: 
""The Prophet Ibrahim (peace be 
  upon him) was circumcisized when he was eighty years old."" (Al-Bukhari, 
  Vol 6/p. 388, Al-Salfiyya printing). 
Male circumcision is obligatory for the 
  Muslim male if he is able to do it.  If, however, he is unable, whether 
  due to fear of injury or if a respected and authoritative doctor has told him 
  he will experience profuse bleeding which may make his life miserable, then 
  the obligation for cirumcision is waived and he does not commit a sin by not 
  having it done. 
It is not permissible under any circumstance 
  for the issue to become a hindrance for a person wanting to accept Islaam.  
  The validity of one's acceptance of Islaam is not dependent on his performance 
  of circumcision and it is valid for one to adopt Islaam even if he has not had 
  himself circumcized. 
Regarding the issue of female circumcision, 
  please refer to question # 328.

is not permissible. Such acts invent a way to worship Allaah which was not revealed or taught by Islam. 
The Prophet  (peace be upon him) said:
Whoever innovates in our religion a new act (of worship) then his act is rejected"" (Sahih al-Bukhari, 
Fath al-Baari No. 2697.) 
The best guidance is that of the Prophet  . There is no allowance for innovation in the religion of 
Allaah. Is it possible for us to discover new things in our religion that the Prophet  didnt know? 
Indeed, it is incumbent upon us to read the Koran in the way the Prophet  read it, we need to pray in 
the way he prayed, and glorify Allaahs name in the way the Prophet  has been validly reported to have 
done. 
Only Allaah is the one who provides success, and He is the one who guides to the right path.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
486,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/486,Religious celebrations in islam,I need to know about any celebrations of this religions or any festivals.,,,"Praise be to Allah.As Muslims, we celebrate only two eid (festivals): eid ul-fitr (after the end of Ramadhan), and eid ul-Udh-ha, the day of the greater hajj (pilgrimage). During these two festivals, we offer felicitations, spread joy, and entertain children. But more importantly, we offer remembrance of Allaah's blessings, celebrate His name and offer the eid salaat (prayer). Other than these two occasions, we do not recognize or celebrate any other days in the year.
Of course, there are other joyous occasions for which the Islamic shariah dictates appropriate celebration, such as gathering for special meals during weddings or on the occasion of the birth of a child (aqeeqah). However, these days are not specified as particular days in the year; rather, they are celebrated as they happen in the course of a Muslims life.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

Please tell me the answer as soon as possible!",,,"Praise be to Allah.The greatest achievement of Islam is that it has freed man from the worship of other beings and delivered 
him to the worship of the creator of all beings. As a religious text, the Qur'aan is not a record of inventions 
or discoveries in this life, but rather a revealed book that helps in the replenishment, enlightenment and 
solace of humanity. Through it, man can help in the development and civilization of this earth, and through 
it man can ponder the signs of Allaah's creation.
Accordingly, Muslims have concentrated on the study of this universe and made great strides in the fields 
of medicine, astronomy, mathematics, physics, etc. However, the specifics of these contributions are not 
the area of concentration for Muslim scholars, and there are perhaps better sources than this forum to 
explain the role of Muslim scientists, such as books written for this specific purpose. One can always refer 
to books written by fair-minded non-Muslims about the achievements of al-Khawarizmi in mathematics, Ibn 
Haytham in physics, al-Idrisi in geography,and Ibn Nafees in the circulatory system.etc.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
