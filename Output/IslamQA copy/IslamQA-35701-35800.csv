35705,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/35705,He wants to name his son Najeeb – does he have the right to call his son Najeeb?,"Allaah has blessed us with a baby boy, but my husband and I disagree about what to call him. My husband wants to call him Najeeb, after his father, based on his father’s request, but I do not like this name because I think that I should play a part in choosing my son’s name, and not have this name forced upon me from anywhere. Doesn’t all the hardship that the mother endures during pregnancy, birth and breastfeeding and all the efforts of childrearing give her the right to choose the name of her child? I am afraid that this name may affect the way I deal with my son; how can I call him by a name that I do not like? I do not know if his father has the right in Islam to make this choice, and whether it is permissible to marginalize my opinion My opinion may be weak, but I am looking for the truth and I do not want to wrong myself, my son or my husband. Whatever the case, I will accept the verdict of sharee’ah in sha Allaah. Please advise us, may Allaah bless you and take care of you.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: You have done well by accepting the ruling of Islam in all cases. 
Secondly: May Allaah bless your newborn and cause him to grow up in obedience to Allaah. 
Thirdly: The scholars have stated that naming the child is the right of the father, to whom he is to be attributed, so he is called So and so the son of So and so, or So and so the daughter of So and so. 
Fourthly: It is not necessarily the case that the mother be rewarded for some of her efforts in this world, and it is better for her to take that in the Hereafter. 
Fifthly: Despite all this, it is mustahabb for the father to try to reconcile all interests if possible, and to consult the mother, but in the case of disagreement, he is the one who makes the decision.  
Sixthly: For the father to honour his own father is a good deed, especially when he grows older. If he misses the opportunity to honour him with this child, he may miss out on the opportunity to do so in the future, but if he honours him with this child, he will be rewarded for that, and he may please his wife by allowing her to choose the name of the next child. 
We ask Allaah to bless you with more. 
Seventhly: The name Najeeb in and of itself is a good name which means noble or generous. 
Al-Fayroozabaadi said in al-Qaamoos (p. 136): Najeeb means “of noble descent”. 
This is a name which bodes well for the child. 
We ask Allaah to protect him and enable him to grow up in obedience to Allaah, and to give you more than you hoped for through him.

35726,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/35726,How can he get rid of shares in riba-based banks?,"A man bought shares in a bank that deals in riba, and now he wants to get rid of them. What should he do?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    It is not permissible to buy shares in riba-based banks or in 
    companies that are based on riba, because that is consuming riba, and the 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed 
    the one who consumes riba and the one who pays it. Narrated by Muslim 
    (1597). 

    In a statement issued by the Islamic Fiqh Council during its 
    seventh conference, held in Jeddah in 1412 AH, it says: 

    There is no dispute that shares in companies whose basic aims 
    are haraam, such as dealing with riba, producing haraam things or dealing in 
    haraam things, are also haraam. End quote. 

    Majallat al-Majma’ al-Fiqhi, no. 
    7, vol. 1, p. 711 

    Secondly: 

    If a person has bought these shares, he has to repent to 
    Allaah by regretting what he has done, resolving not to do it again, and 
    getting out of the company or bank, and selling these shares. He is not 
    entitled to anything more than his capital, and whatever is greater than his 
    capital he must spend it on charitable causes. 

    The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked: I had some 
    shares in a company, and this company went bankrupt 25 years ago. There were 
    trustees of the company who bought into the Riyadh bank with what was left 
    of the shares, 25 years ago, each share costing 1000 riyals. Now the price 
    of one share is 30,000 riyals. I need this money, so is it permissible to 
    take the current value of the share, knowing that they bought these shares 
    in the Riyadh bank without us knowing all this time? They replied: You 
    should take the entire amount, the capital and the interest, then keep the 
    capital, because that belongs to you, and give the interest in charity, 
    because it is riba. Allaah will make you independent of means by His bounty, 
    and will compensate you with something better than it, and He will help you 
    to meet your needs.  

    “And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He 
    will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty).

    3. And He will provide him from (sources) he never could 
    imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allaah, then He will suffice him.”

    [al-Talaaq 65:2-3]

    End quote. Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (13/506) 

    It also says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah 
    (13/508): It is not permissible to buy shares in banks or companies that 
    deal with riba. If our correspondent wants to get rid of his riba-based 
    shares, he may sell them at the market price, then keep his original capital 
    only; the rest he should spend on charitable causes. It is not permissible 
    for him to take any of the interest or riba-based profits of his shares. But 
    if the shares were in a company that does not deal in riba, then the profits 
    on them are halaal. End quote.
