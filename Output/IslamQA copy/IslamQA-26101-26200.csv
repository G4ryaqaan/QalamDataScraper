26106,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26106,Jihad with one’s wealth is compulsory for the rich.,"I am a Muslim woman and have a great deal of wealth, praise be to Allah. Is it obligatory for me to pay some of the wealth to the oppressed Muslims whose enemies are trying to occupy their land and kill them, as in Chechnya, Palestine and other Muslim lands?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The Muslims are obliged to help their oppressed brothers in all places. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The believers are nothing else than brothers (in Islamic religion)” [al-Hujuraat 49:10]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The Muslim is the brother of his fellow-Muslim; he does not wrong him or abandon.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2442; Muslim, 2580.  Muslim added in another hadeeth (2546), “and he does not forsake him.” 
Al-Haafiz said:  
“He does not abandon him” means he does not leave him with someone who could harm him, or in a situation where he could be harmed, rather he helps him and defends him… That may be obligatory or it may be recommended, depending on the situation. 
He said in al-Nihaayah: “Abandoning someone” refers to when he leaves him to his fate and does not protect him from his enemy. 
From Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi. 
Al-Nawawi said: 
“And he does not forsake him” – the scholars said: forsaking means failing to help and support. What this means is that when a person is asked for help to ward off an oppressor and the like, he must help him if that is possible and he has no legitimate shar’i excuse (for not doing so). 
The jihad in Chechnya, Palestine and other occupied Muslim countries or countries that the enemy is trying to occupy and take over comes under the heading of jihad for the purpose of self-defence. We have already discussed the rulings on that in question no. 34830. 
If a man is not able to help his Muslim brothers himself by joining them physically in jihad, then he must help them and strive in jihad with them by means of his wealth if he is rich. 
Similarly a woman is also obliged to engage in jihad by means of her wealth. 
Jihad with one's wealth is mentioned alongside jihad with one’s self in the Book of Allah. 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“March forth, whether you are light (being healthy, young and wealthy) or heavy (being ill, old and poor), and strive hard with your wealth and your lives in the Cause of Allah. This is better for you, if you but knew” [al-Tawbah 9:41] 
“Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home), except those who are disabled (by injury or are blind or lame), and those who strive hard and fight in the Cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives. Allah has preferred in grades those who strive hard and fight with their wealth and their lives above those who sit (at home). Unto each, Allah has promised good (Paradise), but Allah has preferred those who strive hard and fight, above those who sit (at home) by a huge reward” [al-Nisa’ 4:95] 
 
“Those who believed (in the Oneness of Allah — Islamic Monotheism) and emigrated and strove hard and fought in Allah’s Cause with their wealth and their lives, are far higher in degree with Allah. They are the successful” [al-Tawbah 9:20] 
“Only those are the believers who have believed in Allah and His Messenger, and afterward doubt not but strive with their wealth and their lives for the Cause of Allah. Those! They are the truthful” [al-Hujuraat 49:15]
Abu Dawood (2504) narrated from Anas that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Fight the mushriks by means of your wealth and your selves and your tongues.” Saheeh Abu Dawood, 2186. 
Al-San’aani said in Subul al-Salaam, 4/87 
This hadeeth indicates that it is obligatory to fight in jihad with one's self, which means going out and confronting the kuffaar directly; with one's wealth, which means spending on what is required for jihad such as weapons etc; and with one's tongue, by establishing proof against them, calling them to Allah, and by raising one’s voices when meeting the enemy and shouting at them and everything else that will cause harm to the enemies. 
Al-Shawkaani said in Nayl al-Awtaar (8/29): 
This indicates that it is obligatory to engage in jihad against the enemy with one’s wealth, one’s hands and one’s tongue. The Qur’aanic command mentions jihad with one’s self and one’s wealth in several places, and the apparent meaning of the command is that it is obligatory.  
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in al-Ikhtiyaaraat, p. 530: 
Whoever is unable to take part in jihad physically but is able to take part in jihad by means of his wealth, is obliged to take part in jihad by means of his wealth. So those who are well off must spend for the sake of Allah. 
Based on this: it is obligatory for women to take part in jihad by means of their wealth if they have excess wealth. The same applies to the wealth of minors if there is a need, just as it is also obligatory to pay zakaah on this wealth. But if the enemy attacks, there is no room for differences of opinion, because in that case it is obligatory according to scholarly consensus, to ward off their harm to religious commitment, lives and honour.  
Spending for the sake of Allah is one of the best kinds of charity, for which Allah has promised a great reward. He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The likeness of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah, is as the likeness of a grain (of corn); it grows seven ears, and each ear has a hundred grains. Allah gives manifold increase to whom He wills. And Allah is All-Sufficient for His creatures’ needs, All-Knower” [al-Baqarah 2:261]
Al-Sa’di (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“The likeness of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah” means, in obedience to Him and seeking His pleasure, foremost among which is spending on jihad for His sake. “Is as the likeness of a grain (of corn); it grows seven ears, and each ear has a hundred grains” this gives a vivid image of the greatness of the multiple reward, as if a person can see that with his own eyes, so that with strong faith and this vivid image in his mind, a man will be able to spend in the hope of this great reward from Allah. 
 “Allah gives manifold increase” meaning, this multiplication of the reward, “to whom He wills”, meaning according to the situation of the giver and his sincerity and honesty, and according to the situation of what is given, whether it is halaal and beneficial and whether it is spent in an appropriate manner. “Allah gives manifold increase” – more than that, “to whom He wills” – so He gives them reward without reckoning.
“And Allah is All-Sufficient” giving abundantly, so the giver should not imagine that this increase is a kind of exaggeration, because no bounty is too great for Allah to give, and giving does not decrease what He possesses of bounty.
And He is “All-Knower” and knows who deserves that increase and who does not, so He bestows the increase as appropriate because of His complete knowledge and wisdom.

26108,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26108,Turning one’s rida’ inside out should be done during the khutbah of istisqa’ when the imam turns his rida’ inside out.,"In one of the mosques I saw one of the seekers of knowledge wearing his ‘abayah (cloak) inside before the prayer for rain (istisqa’), and after the prayer I asked him he reason for that, because what I know is that the ‘abayah should be turned inside out after the prayer and khutbah are over. He said: There’s nothing with that, rather we turned it inside out before the prayer so that when we changed it again it would be right side out. What is your opinion concerning this? May Allaah reward you with good.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The apparent meaning of the ahaadeeth narrated from the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) concerning the 
    prayer for rain (salaat al-istisqa’) is that the rida’ (cloak, upper 
    garment) should be worn as normal, and it should be turned inside out during 
    the khutbah when the imam turns his rida’ inside out. 

    With regard to turning the rida’ or ‘abayah inside out before 
    that, the more correct view is that this is not prescribed and is contrary 
    to the Sunnah. May Allaah help us all.","Kitaab Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah li Samaahat al-Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) – vol 13, p.83"
26113,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26113,How to Calculate Zakah on Salary,"I am an employee with a monthly salary of 2000 Saudi Riyals. My family is all dependent on me and I pay all their expenses from my salary. I have a wife, daughter, father and brothers and sisters on whom I spend.
But my question is, how can I pay the zakah on my wealth when my only source of income is this salary, and all of my salary is spent on my family? 
So when should I pay my zakah? Some people say that a salary is like agricultural crops, and one should not wait until one full year has passed before paying it. So when does zakah become obligatory upon my salary?","This is how to calculate zakah on salary: If you take your salary for Muharram, and save one thousand Riyals of it, then you do likewise in Safar and the remaining months, when Muharram comes in the following year, you look at all that you have and pay zakah based on that.","Is there zakah on salary?


Is zakah on a salary like zakah on agricultural crops


How to calculate Zakah on salary","Praise be to Allah.Is there zakah on salary?
If a person has a monthly salary and he spends all of it and has nothing left, so that at the end of the month he has spent all his money, then he does not have to pay zakah . For zakah to be obligatory, one full year must have passed (i.e., one full year from the date of his taking possession of the nisab , the minimum amount of wealth on which zakah is due). 
On this basis, you do not have to pay zakah, unless you save some of your wealth and that amount reaches the nisab (threshold or minimum amount), and one year has passed. 
Is zakah on a salary like zakah on agricultural crops
With regard to the person who told you that the zakah on a salary is like the zakah on agricultural crops and you do not have to wait until one full year has passed before paying it, what he said is not correct. 
As most people work for a salary, we think that it is a good idea to describe how zakah is to be paid on salaries.
How to calculate Zakah on salary 
Zakah on the salary of an employee:
The employee with a salary will find himself in one of the following two situations:

Either he spends all of it and does not save anything, in which case he is not obliged to pay zakah, as in the case of the person who asked this question;
Or he will save some of it, sometimes more and sometimes less. So how is zakah to be reckoned in this case?

 The answer is: if he insists on having all his rights and on not giving any charity to those who deserve it apart from what he is obliged to give, then he should make a schedule of his earnings and write down every amount and the date on which he took possession of it. Then he should pay zakah for each amount separately when one year has passed from the date on which he took possession of it.
But if he wants an easier method, and wants to be more generous and give precedence to the poor and others who are entitled to zakah over himself, then he can pay zakah on all the money he possesses when one year has passed from the date when his wealth first reached the nisab. This will bring a greater reward and raise him higher in status; it is easier for him and is more generous towards the poor and needy and others who are entitled to zakah. Whatever extra amount he may pay will be regarded as a “down payment” on the zakah for any wealth for which one year has not yet passed.  (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 9/280)
For example: a man takes his salary for Muharram, and saves one thousand riyals of it. Then he does likewise in Safar and the remaining months. When Muharram comes in the following year, he looks at all that he has and pays zakah based on that.

26117,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26117,The Lives of the Prophets,"Are the prophets alive or dead?

Whe Prophet Muhammed (pbuh) went on the miraaj (ascension), all the prophets prayed behind him in al-Masjid al-Aqsa, then prophet Muhammed (pbuh) went though each heaven and met some of the more well known prophets again who must have prayed behind him earlier. Therefore, how could the prophets be in al-Masjid al-Aqsa and then in the heavens after. 

Or are the prophets alive, but in a different reality to us?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The Prophets (blessings and peace of Allaah 
    be upon them) are dead as far as the people of this world are concerned. Allaah says, addressing the last and best of them (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 
“Verily, you (O Muhammad) will die, and 
    verily, they (too) will die”
[al-Zumar 39:30]
But before Allaah they are alive, for if the 
    martyrs are alive with Allaah, then the Prophets are undoubtedly higher in status before Allaah. See Fath al-Baari, 6/444. 
It was narrated in an authentic report that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The Prophets are alive in their graves and they pray.” (Narrated by al-Bazzaar; 
    classed as authentic by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 2790). This prayer is something that they are blessed with just as the people of 
    Paradise are blessed with tasbeeh (glorifying Allaah). 
They (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon 
    them) are in their graves apart from ‘Eesa (Jesus)(peace be upon him), whom Allaah raised up into heaven, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“But they killed him not, nor crucified him, but it appeared so to them [the resemblance of 
    ‘Eesa (Jesus) was put over another man (and they killed that man)], and those who differ therein are full of doubts. They have no (certain) 
    knowledge, they follow nothing but conjecture. For surely; they killed him not [i.e. ‘Eesa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary)]:
But Allaah raised him [‘Eesa (Jesus)] up 
    (with his body and soul) unto Himself (and he is in the heavens). And Allaah is Ever All-Powerful, All-Wise.”
[al-Nisa’ 4:157-158]
With regard to the Prophets praying behind 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) on the night of the Isra’ (Night Journey), they prayed behind him in spirit, but 
    their bodies were in their graves. The same applies to his seeing the Prophets during the Mi’raaj (ascent into heaven), when he saw Adam in the 
    lowest heaven, and ‘Eesa and Yahya in the second heaven, and Yoosuf in the third, and Idrees in the fourth, and Haroon in the fifth, and Moosa in 
    the sixth, and Ibraaheem in the seventh, or vice versa. He saw their souls appear in the shape of their bodies. 
Some people say that he saw the same bodies 
    that are buried in the graves, but this view does not carry any weight. 
But ‘Eesa ascended into heaven body and soul, 
    and the same is said of Idrees. 
But with regard to Ibraaheem, Moosa and 
    others, they are buried on earth. 
The Messiah (may the blessings and peace of 
    Allaah be upon him and all the other Prophets) will inevitably descend to earth, to the white minaret in the east of Damascus; he will kill the 
    Dajjaal (“Antichrist”), break the cross and kill the pigs, as is proven in the saheeh ahaadeeth (authentic reports). Hence he is in the second heaven even though he 
    is superior to Yoosuf, Idrees and Haroon, because he will descend to the earth before the Day of Resurrection, unlike the other Prophets. And Adam 
    is in the lowest heaven because the souls of his descendents who are blessed (i.e., destined for Paradise) will be shown to him. As for the souls 
    of the doomed (i.e., those who are destined for Hell) the gates of heaven will not be opened for them and they will not enter Paradise until the 
    camel passes through the eye of the needle. So if they will be shown to him, he has to be near them. There is no contradiction in the fact that 
    they (may blessings and peace of Allaah be upon them) prayed behind the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) then he met 
    some of them after he was taken up into the heavens, because the souls are like the angels, they may ascend and descend in an instant; they are 
    not like bodies.

26119,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26119,Making up zakaah from past years,"I would like to know what I should do about Zakat. I have failed to pay in previous years out of a failure to follow the straight path of Islam. I have in the past year returned to Islam (Al-hamdulilah) and I am earning money and I would like to pay my Zakat and try to correct past sins if possible. However, I have some loans I took in the past and I have this debt. How do I pay the Zakat for the years that I missed and will it be accepted considering that missing the Zakat in previous years was haram and I am paying money on loans that are haram?",,,"Praise be to Allah.We praise Allaah for having guided you, and we ask Allaah to make you steadfast and know that Allaah is Forgiving and Most Merciful. He rejoices over the repentance of His slave, even though He has no need of His creation. We ask Allaah to bestow more of His bounty upon you. 
You have to pay the zakaah of the past years according to the amounts of money that you possessed after paying off the debts of each year. Once you arecertain about the amount in any year, then you have to pay zakaah on it. If you do not know the exact amounts, then guess and pay based on that estimate. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: 
A man was careless about paying zakaah for five years, and now he is repenting. Does repentance free him of the obligation to pay zakaah? If it does not free him of that obligation, then what is the solution? This wealth is more than ten thousand and he does not know how much it is now. 
He replied: 
Zakaah is an act of worship towards Allaah and it is the right of the poor. If a person withholds it, then he is violating two rights: the right of Allaah and the right of the poor and others who are entitled to zakaah. If he repents after five years – as stated in the question – then he is absolved of the obligation to fulfil the right of Allaah, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And He it is Who accepts repentance from His slaves, and forgives sins”
[al-Shoora 42:25]
But the second right still remains, which is the right of those who are entitled to zakaah, the poor and others. So he has to hand over the zakaah to these people, and perhaps he will attain the reward for zakaah if his repentance is sound, for the bounty of Allaah is immense. 
With regard to working out the amount of zakaah, he should estimate the amount of zakaah as best he can, and Allaah does not burden any soul beyond its scope. So if it is ten thousand, for example, how much is the zakaah for one year? Two hundred and fifty. If the amount of zakaah is two hundred and fifty, then he should pay two hundred and fifty for each of the past years, unless in some of those years he had more than ten thousand, in which case he should pay extra. If it was less in some years, then he should pay less zakaah, accordingly.

26139,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26139,A brief look at the beliefs of the Druze,Can you give me a brief idea about the beliefs of the Druze? What is the Islamic ruling concerning them?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.The Druze originated as a secret sect among the esoteric (baatini) groups that appear outwardly to be Muslim and who sometimes pretend to be religious, ascetic and pious. They make an outward show of false pride in religion, pretending to be various kinds of Shi’ahs, Sufis and lovers of Ahl al-Bayt (the family of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)). They claim to carry the banner of peace and reconciliation amongst people, and they talk about uniting people in order to deceive them and lead them astray from their religion. When the opportunity arises, when they become stronger and find supporters among the ruling classes, they show their true colours and proclaim their real beliefs and aims, and they start to promote evil and corruption, and try to destroy religious teachings, sound beliefs and morals. 
This is clear to anyone who studies their history and follows their progress from the day the Jew ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Saba’ lay the foundations and planted the seed, a legacy which has been handed down from one generation to another, as they have tried hard to implement these principles, and this has continued until the present day. 
Although the Druze are one of these esoteric groups, they have their own characteristics as regards their origins and the time when they emerged, and the circumstances which helped them to become established. We will mention some brief details concerning that and the rulings of the scholars concerning them. 
1 – The Druze are named after Durzi, whose full name was Abu ‘Abd-Allaah Muhammad ibn Ismaa’eel al-Durzi. His name is also given as ‘Abd-Allaah al-Durzi and Durzi ibn Muhammad. It was said that Muhammad ibn Ismaa’eel al-Durzi was Tashtakeen or Hashtakeen al-Durzi. It was also said that they are named after Tayrooz, a city in Persia. Al-Zubaydi narrated that the correct form of the name is Darzi, based on the phrase “awlaad darzah” meaning those who are base and vile. 
2 – Muhammad ibn Ismaa’eel al-Durzi appeared at the time of al-Haakim bi Amrihi, Abu ‘Ali al-Mansoor ibn al-‘Azeez, one of the ‘Ubaydi kings (known in the west as Fatimids) who ruled Egypt for nearly two hundred years and who falsely claimed to be descended from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) through Faatimah (may Allaah be pleased with her). 
Muhammad ibn Ismaa’eel al-Durzi was originally a follower of the esoteric Ismaili sect who claim to be the followers of Muhammad ibn Isma’eel ibn Ja’far al-Saadiq. Then he left this group and contacted the ‘Ubaydi al-Haakim, approving of his claim to divinity, and he called the people to worship him alone. He claimed that God had become incarnate in ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib, and that the soul of ‘Ali has migrated to his sons one after another, until it reached al-Haakim. Al-Haakim gave him authority in Egypt so that the people would obey him in his call. When his true intentions became clear, the Muslims in Egypt rebelled against him and killed some of his supporters. When they wanted to kill him, he escaped and fled to al-Haakim, who gave him some money and told him to go to Syria to spread his call there. So he went there and stopped in Waadi Taym-Allaah ibn Tha’labah, to the west of Damascus, where he called them to deify al-Haakim and spread the principles of the Druze among them, and distributed money to them, and they responded to his call. 
Another man also spread the call of the deification of al-Haakim, a Persian man whose name was Hamzah ibn ‘Ali ibn Ahmad al-Haakimi al-Durzi, one of the leading baatinis. He had contacted the leaders of the secret call of al-Haakim’s party, and he called for his deification in secret until he became one of their main leaders. Then he proclaimed that openly and claimed that he was the messenger of al-Haakim, and al-Haakim supported him in that. When al-Haakim died and was succeeded by his son who was known as Al-Zaahir li I’zaaz Deen Allaah (the supporter of the religion of Allaah), and he disavowed himself of his father’s claim to divinity, this call was chased out of Egypt. Hamzah fled to Syria and was followed by some of those who had responded to his call. Most of them settled in the region that later came to be known as Jebel el Druze in Syria. 
Their principles are as follows: 
(a)Incarnation. They believe that Allaah was incarnated in ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him), then in his sons after him, one after another, until He was incarnated in the Faatimid al-Haakim Abu ‘Ali al-Mansoor ibn al-‘Azeez. They believe that al-Haakim will return and that he disappears and reappears.
(b)Dissimulation (taqiyah) – i.e., hypocrisy and concealment. They do not tell anyone their real beliefs except those who are of their number. Indeed they do not disclose their secrets to anyone except those whom they trust from among their own group.
(c)Infallibility of their imams. They think that their imams are infallible and protected from sin. Indeed, they deified them and worshipped them instead of Allaah, as they did with al-Haakim.
(d)Esotericism (baatiniyyah). They claim that the texts of sharee’ah have an esoteric or secret meaning other than the apparent meaning. They based their heresy concerning the texts on this, and distorted the meanings of the reports, commands and prohibitions.
With regard to their heresy concerning the reports, they deny the perfect attributes of Allaah and they deny the Day of Resurrection with its reckoning and recompense of Paradise and Hell. They replaced that with something that they call the transmigration of souls, the belief that the soul of a person or animal moves, when he or it dies, to the body of another person or animal when he or it is born, to dwell therein being either blessed or tormented. They believe that the universe is eternal and is no more than wombs giving birth and the earth swallowing the bodies of the deceased (i.e., a never-ending cycle of birth and death). They do not believe in the angels or the message of the Prophets, and they follow the philosophers who followed their own whims and desires and the principles and theories of Aristotle. 
With regard to their heresy concerning the texts which stipulate commands and prohibitions, they distort them. They say that salaah (prayer) really means knowledge of their secrets, not the five daily prayers; siyaam (fasting) means concealing their secrets, not refraining from things that break the fast from dawn until sunset; and that Hajj (pilgrimage) means visiting the shaykhs whom they venerate. They regard immoral actions, both outward and inward, as permissible, and they allow marriage to daughters and mothers, and other kinds of tinkering with the texts and denying things that are clearly known to be the laws of Allaah that He has enjoined upon His slaves. Hence Abu Haamid al-Ghazaali and others said concerning them: outwardly their madhhab is Raafidi (Shi’ism) but inwardly it is pure kufr. 
(e) Hypocrisy and deceit in their call. They make an outward display of being Shi’ah and of loving Ahl al-Bayt (the Prophet’s household) to those whom they call. When they respond to them, they call them to Shi’ism and openly criticize the Sahaabah and slander them. If they accept that then they disclose to them the alleged faults of ‘Ali and slander him. If they accept that, then they go on to slander the Prophets and say that they have secrets that go against the message to which they called their nations; they say that they were smart and devised new laws for their nations for them to achieve worldly interests, and so on.
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah was asked about how the Druze and Nusairis should be judged. He replied: 
These Druze and Nusairis are kaafirs, according to the consensus of the Muslims. It is not permissible to eat the meat they slaughter, or to marry their womenfolk. They do not agree to pay the jizyah, so they are apostates from the religion of Islam and are not Muslims, nor are they Jews or Christians. They do not agree that the five daily prayers are obligatory, or that fasting Ramadaan is obligatory, or that Hajj is obligatory. They do not regard as haraam that which Allaah and His Messenger have forbidden of dead meat or wine, etc. Even if they pronounce the Shahaadatayn, with these beliefs they are kaafirs according to the consensus of the Muslims. As for the Nusairis, they are the followers of Abu Shu’ayb Muhammad ibn Naseer, who was one of the extremists who say that ‘Ali is a god, and they recite these words: 
“I bear witness that there is no god except Haidar [i.e., ‘Ali],
and no screen covering him except Muhammad, the honest and trustworthy one,
and there is no way to him except through Salmaan the all-powerful.” 
Haidar is a title given to ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allaah be pleased with him). 
With regard to the Druze, the followers of Hashtakeen al-Durzi, who was one of the freed slaves of al-Haakim whom he sent to the people of Wadi Taym-Allaah ibn Tha’labah and he called them to believe in the divinity of al-Haakim and they call him “the creator, the all-knowing”, and swear by him, they are among the Ismailis who believe that Muhammad ibn Isma’eel abrogated the law of Muhammad ibn ‘Abd-Allaah. They are worse kaafirs than many other extremist groups. They believe that this universe has no creator and they deny the resurrection and the duties and prohibitions of Islam. They are among the esoteric Qarmatians (al-Qaraamitah) who are worse kaafirs than the Jews, Christians and mushrik Arabs. Basically they follow the philosophy of Aristotle and his ilk, or the Magians. Their ideas are a mixture of Magian philosophy but they make an outward, hypocritical display of being Shi’ah. And Allaah knows best.  
Shaykh al-Islam also said, refuting the ideas of some sects of Druze: 
The fact that these groups are kaafirs is something concerning which there is no dispute among the Muslims. Rather whoever doubts that they are kaafirs is a kaafir like them. They do not have a status like that of the People of the Book or of the mushrikeen, rather they are misguided kaafirs and it is not permissible to eat their food, their women may be taken captive and their wealth may be confiscated.

If the imam says the takbeer for rukoo’, the worshipper should remain standing until the imam has finished saying takbeer and has bowed, then he should bow. When the imam rises from the rukoo’, the worshipper should remain bowing until the imam has finished saying “Sami’a Allahu liman hamidah,” and then stand up. This applies to all the movements of the prayer. Preceding the imam means bowing or prostrating before the imam, or starting any movement before him; this invalidates the prayer or reduces its reward.","Al-Lu’lu’ al-Makeen by Shaykh Ibn Jibreen, p. 13"
26149,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26149,Saying lengthy Du`a during Tarawih prayer,Some imams recite lengthy du`a’s in the mosques during Ramadaan and others recite short du`a’s. Which is correct?,,,"Praise be to Allah.What is correct it to make it neither too long nor too short. Making it so long that it causes hardship to people is not allowed. When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) heard that Mu’aadh ibn Jabal was making the prayers too long for his people, he spoke to him angrily in a manner that he had never used when advising someone and said to Mu’aadh: “O Mu’aadh, are you putting people off?” (al-Bukhaari, al-Adab, 6106; Muslim, al-Salaah, 465). What the imam should do is to adhere to the Sunnah.
 Undoubtedly making the du`a too long causes hardship to the people and exhausts them, especially those who are weak. Some people may have work to do, or they may not want to finish before the imam but it is difficult for them to stay with the imam. So we advise our brother imams to follow a moderate course, and to omit the du`a sometimes so that the people will not think that the du`a is obligatory.","Kitaab al-Da’wah, 5, Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 2/198"

Making one’s voice beautiful when reciting Qur’aan is something good and there is nothing wrong with it; rather this is part of the teaching of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
It was narrated that al-Bara’ (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “I heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) reciting Wa’l-teeni wa’l-zaytoon in ‘Isha prayer, and I never heard anyone with a more beautiful voice (or recitation) than his.” 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 735; Muslim, 464 
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) praised the recitation of Abu Moosa al-Ash’ari, who had a melodious voice. But the kind of making the voice beautiful which is encouraged should not distort the meaning of the words and it should not resemble the way that the evildoers sing songs. 
It was narrated that Abu Moosa said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to Abu Moosa, “If only you had seen me when I was listening to you last night, you have been given a beautiful voice like that of Dawood.”  
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4761; Muslim, 793; this version narrated by Muslim 
Al-Nawawi said: 
Al-Qaadi said: The scholars are unanimously agreed that it is mustahabb to make one's voice beautiful when reciting Qur’aan and to recite properly (tarteel). Abu ‘Ubayd said: The ahaadeeth narrated concerning that are to be understood as meaning that it should be done with solemnity and feeling. He said, But they differed with regard to reciting it with a tune. Maalik and the majority regarded that as makrooh because that is contrary to the purpose for which the Qur’aan was revealed, whichis to be recited with humility and understanding. Abu Haneefah and a group among the Salaf regarded it as permissible because of the ahaadeeth and because that is a means of softening people’s hearts, provoking fear and making people receptive towards listening to it. 
I say: al-Shaafa’i said in one place, I dislike reciting Qur’aan with a tune; and elsewhere he said, I do not dislike it. Our companions said: there is no contradiction in this case, rather it has to do with two different situations. When he said that he disliked it, he meant if it was excessively elongated and the meanings of the words were changed by adding or taking away or elongating something that is not to be elongated, etc.; and when he said that it was permissible, he meant if it does not change the meaning of the words. And Allaah knows best. 
Sharh Muslim, 6/80 
Secondly: 
With regard to what your imam does, putting his hand on his forehead and saying Yaa Hayyu, Yaa Qayyoom seven times, there is no basis in sharee’ah for doing this, and it is not in Saheeh Muslim or any other book of saheeh Sunnah. It is a reprehensible bid’ah (innovation) and you have to advise him to stop doing that and explain the shar’i ruling on innovated forms of dhikr. 
With regard to praying behind this imam: it is permissible but it is preferable if you can look for an imam who will establish the Sunnah and teach it to you, because there is the fear that some of the worshippers may be influenced by him and may imitate him and spread his bid’ah. But before doing that, do not forget to advise him and teach him the correct Sunnah for dhikr in particular and for worship in general. Then if he insists on his bid’ah, there is nothing wrong with you taking action to prevent him from leading the prayer. 
The scholars of the Standing Committee said: 
As for praying behind those who follow innovation, if their innovation involves shirk, such as calling upon someone other than Allaah, or making vows to someone other than Allaah, or believing that their shaykhs have characteristics which belong to no one but Allaah, such as having complete knowledge or knowledge of the unseen or influence over the universe, then it is not correct to pray behind them. But if their bid’ah does not involve shirk, such as reciting dhikr that was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) but in unison and swaying, then prayers offered behind them are valid, but the Muslim should look for an imam to pray behind who is not an innovator, because that will bring him a greater reward and is farther removed from evil. 
And Allaah is the Source of Strength. May Allaah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.

26154,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26154,Imaam with a beautiful voice that motivates the worshippers,"We are in charge of a large number of students in their residences, and we have devised a special program for them to raise their Islamic awareness. This includes inviting one of the imams of the mosques in the city who is known for his beautiful voice, to lead them in Fajr prayer, hoping that this will motivate them with the Qur’aan. Please note that the regular imam of the mosque has agreed to this. What is the shar’i ruling on this?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    What I think is that there is nothing wrong with that, 
    because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    listened to the recitation of Abu Moosa al-Ash’ari (may Allaah be pleased 
    with him) and liked it, and said to him, “You have been given a beautiful 
    voice like that of Dawood.” He [Abu Moosa] asked, “Were you listening to

    you were listening I would have tried to make it more beautiful for you.”

The correct version is that Allah initially – on the night of the Mi’raj when our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was taken up into heaven – enjoined fifty prayers to be performed night and day . Then the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) kept asking his Lord to reduce it until it became five prayers to be offered night and day.

Then I came back to Musa and said, ‘He has reduced it.’ He said, ‘Go back to your Lord, for your Ummah will not be able to bear that.’ So I went back and He reduced it further. Then I came back to Musa and said, ‘He has reduced it further.’ He said, ‘Go back to your Lord, for your Ummah will not be able to bear that.’ So I went back and He said, ‘(The prayers) are five but (the reward) is fifty.

I have told him and my father many times that i find it hard to get on with him. Our marriage happened in Pakistan when i was going through a very bad time. My mother had been accused of adultery and was locked up in her Father-in-laws house. Me and my brother who were in Pakistan at the time were not allowed to talk to her or even see her.  It was in those days that my father suggested that i get married. I had my Nikaah done then came to England. When my husband came over i tried to get on with him but found it very hard. I dont want to stay with him because i know that i wont be able to love and respect him like a wife should. I also dont want to hurt my father by getting a divorce. If i do get a divorce will i be punished for hurting my father so much? Do you think it is right for me to get a divorce or carry on like this ''trying'' to work it out but not getting anywhere?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    What we advise our sister to do is to try to avoid hurting 
    her father’s feelings and also give her husband his right to love and 
    obedience. 

    If she is unable to give her husband his rights, and she does 
    not feel any fondness for him, which makes her feel put off by him and makes 
    her not want to obey him,  then what she should do in this case is to free 
    herself from him by means of khula’ and not ask him for a divorce (talaaq). 

    There is a great difference between talaaq and khula’. Talaaq 
    is done by the husband because he does not like his wife – for example – and 
    not because of any reason on her part. Then the wife must observe the ‘iddah 
    (waiting period) according to her situation. If she is pregnant, the ‘iddah 
    lasts until she gives birth; if she is very young or is past the age of 
    menopause, then she should wait for three months; if she is of child-bearing 
    age then she should wait for three menstrual cycles. The husband has to give 
    his wife the entire mahr and all her rights. 

    Khula’ is initiated by the wife, and she gives him money to 
    leave her. It is preferable for the husband not to ask for more than the 
    mahr which he had given to her. Her ‘iddah lasts for one menstrual cycle, to 
    establish that she is not pregnant. 

    A similar case happened to some of the women of the Sahaabah 
    as that which the sister is asking about. 

    It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas said: The wife of Thaabit 
    ibn Qays came to the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) and said, “O Messenger of Allaah, I do not find any fault in 
    Thaabit’s religious commitment or character, but I cannot bear to live with 
    him.” The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said: “Will you give him back his garden [that he had given as the 
    mahr]?” She said, “Yes.” 

    (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4972) 

    According to another report (4971): “I do not find any fault 
    in Thaabit’s religious commitment or character, but I would hate to fall 
    into sin by rejecting the commands of Islam when I am a Muslim.”  

    i.e., I am afraid that I may do something which would go 
    against the rulings of Islam such as hating my husband, disobeying him, not 
    giving him his rights, etc. See Fath al-Baari, 9/400 

    To sum up: you have to try to get along with your husband and 
    give him his rights, and if you cannot then you have to free yourself from 
    the marriage by means of khula’. You can ask for your father’s approval and 
    explain to him that staying with your husband will adversely affect your 
    religious commitment and your worldly interests. If he agrees, all well and 
    good, but you do not have to stay with your husband when you do not like him 
    and you cannot give him his rights. We ask Allaah to relieve you of your 
    distress and to help you and give you a good life.",Islam Q&A

But if we say that we wish we could meet the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the Sahabah/Companions (may Allah be pleased with them), and the Tabi’een (Successors) and the scholars, this feeling is the hope of meeting them in Paradise, The person who wishes that he could meet these great people has to strive hard so that his Lord will be pleased with him and will admit him to Paradise with them, so that his longing will be fulfilled and will come to pass. This is the good result of longing to see the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them). This is the way in which the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them)missed the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) after he died. For example, Muslim narrated that Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “After the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) died, Abu Bakr said to ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both), ‘Let us go and visit Umm Ayman as the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to visit her. When they came to her, she wept, and they said, ‘Why are you crying? What is with Allah is better for His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).’ She said, ‘I am not weeping because I do not know that what is with Allah is better for His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Rather I am weeping because the Revelation from heaven has come to an end.’ That moved them deeply and they began to weep with her.”
(Muslim, 2454)
But if this missing a deceased friend or relative makes a person feel grief and despair – and sometimes distress – and makes him object to the will and decree of Allah, then this should not be allowed and should be denounced and forbidden, because this may lead to the development of bad characteristics which Islam strives to keep its followers away from.

    Firstly: 

    Yes indeed, it is not permissible for a Muslim to inherit 
    from a kaafir or for a kaafir to inherit from a Muslim. If a Muslim dies and 
    leaves behind a Jewish or Christian wife, it is not permissible for her to

    inherit from a kaafir and the kaafir does not inherit from a Muslim.”

It is proven from the

Passing in front of someone who is praying in congregation","Praise be to Allah.Consequence of speaking without knowledge 
You should note – may Allah forgive you – that you have committed a great sin, which is attributing someting to Allah without sure knowledge. This is a sin which Allah mentioned in conjunction with Shirk (ascribing a partner or rival to Allah). Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Say (O Muhammad): (But) the things that my Lord has indeed forbidden are immoralities whether committed openly or secretly, sins (of all kinds), unrighteous oppression, joining partners (in worship) with Allah for which He has given no authority, and saying things about Allah of which you have no knowledge.” [Al-A`raf 7:33]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever introduces a good way in Islam which is followed after he dies will have a reward like that of those who did it, without that detracting from their reward in the slightest. Whoever introduces a bad way in Islam which is followed after he dies will have a burden of sin like that of those who did it, without that detracting from their burden in the slightest.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1017, from Jarir ibn ‘Abdullah) 
So you have to repent to Allah and seek His forgiveness for this sin. I ask Allah to bless you with sincere repentance. 
You should also strive to correct your mistake by telling those who heard what you said before without knowledge. 
Passing in front of someone who is praying alone
With regard to the question that you mentioned, if someone wants to pass in front of a person who is praying , one of the following scenarios must apply: 

If he passes in front of the one who is praying , i.e., in the area between the spot where he puts his forehead when he prostrates and where he stands, this is prohibited, and indeed it is a major sin. 

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If the one who passes in front of a person who is praying knows what (a burden of sin) he bears, it would be better for him to stand for forty rather than pass in front of him.” Abu Al-Nadar – one of the narrators – said: I do not know whether he said forty days or months or years. (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 510; Muslim, 507 – from Abu Juhaym (may Allah be pleased with him) 
In this case, it makes no difference whether the person has a Sutrah (object to serve as a screen) or not. 

If he passes in the area that is beyond the place where he prostrates. Two scenarios may apply in this case: 


If the one who is praying has set up a Sutrah . In this case, it is permissible to pass beyond the Sutrah . The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If any one of you prays, let him face towards something (a Sutrah). If he cannot find anything, then let him set up a stick. If he cannot do that, then let him draw a line, then it will not matter if anyone passes in front of him (beyond that).” (Narrated by Ahmad, 3/15; Ibn Majah, 3063; Ibn Hibban, 2361. Ibn Hajar said in Al-Buloogh, 249: The one who said that the Hadith is inauthentic is not right; rather it is sound.)

Talhah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If one of you puts something in front of him that is height of the back of a saddle, then let him pray and not worry about anyone who passes beyond that.” (Narrated by Muslim, 499)

 If the one who is praying has not set up a Sutrah, he has no more than the space in which he prostrates. This is the most correct scholarly opinion. It is permissible for the one who wants to pass in front of him to pass beyond the spot where he prostrates. That is because the prohibition mentioned in the Hadith applies to passing in front of the one who is praying, and what is beyond the place where he prostrates is not counted as being in front of the one who is praying.

Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said, after mentioning the differences of scholarly opinion concerning the distance within which the worshipper should stop anyone from passing in front of him: 
""The most correct opinion is that it is the distance between his feet and the place where he prostrates. That is because the one who is praying has no right to anything more than what he needs for his prayer. So he does not have the right to prevent the people from (using space) that which he does not need.” (Al-Sharh Al-Mumti’, 3/340) 
Passing in front of someone who is praying in congregation
All of this has to do with one who is praying alone or is leading others in prayer. If he is a member of a congregation , then the Sutrah of the Imam is the Sutrah for those who are behind him. 
Al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: (Chapter: The Sutrah of the Imam is the Sutrah of those who are behind him). 
Ibn `Abbas said: “Once I came riding a female donkey and had just attained the age of puberty. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was praying at Mina, and there was no wall in front of him. I passed in front of part of the row while they were praying. Then I let the donkey loose to graze and joined the row, and nobody objected to it.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 76; Muslim, 504)  (Al-Mughni, 2/42, 2/46) 
The correct scholarly view is that Makkah and other places are the same because of the general meaning of the evidence. There is nothing to suggest that Makkah is not included in this general meaning. This is the view favoured by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin. (Al-Sharh Al-Mumti’, 3/342)

26184,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26184,A donor has stipulated a haraam condition for a waqf; do we have to fulfil it?,"We live at this moment in Europe, but I'm planning to return to my country Morocco as soon as I finish my studies. We own a house there, which actually belongs to my father. My father is very sick lately and is suffering cancer. He feels that his end is near, therefore he wants to do good deeds (sadaqa djariah). Our family always practiced sufism and a part of my family still does. My father believes that he would be doing well by letting people do dhikr in de sufi way at our home in Morocco. He wants me to promise him to keep those people coming there even when he dies.

 My question is: How can I convince my dad that those actions are bid'ah?

If he still doesn't agree, can I break my promise and refuse those people into our house?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Undoubtedly ongoing charity is one of the righteous good 
    deeds that remain after a person dies, and its reward will continue to reach 
    him whilst he is in the world of the dead. Hence Islam encourages such 
    actions. It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allaah  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When a person dies, all 
    his good deeds come to an end apart from three: ongoing charity, beneficial 
    knowledge and a righteous child who will pray for him.” 

    Narrated by Muslim, 1631 

    But unfortunately some people do not choose a kind of charity 
    that is Islamically acceptable and that will bring them reward after death. 
    For example, some people build rabats and zawiyahs in which dhikr is done in 
    a manner that is not in accordance with the teachings of the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), indeed things may be done there 
    that go against sharee’ah and contradict Tawheed, such as words that include 
    claims that the awliya’ have knowledge of the Unseen and control the 
    universe, or that the Prophets (peace be upon them) are followers of these 
    awliya’. 

    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: 

    In brief, there is no dispute among the scholars concerning 
    the fact that whoever makes a waqf with provisions for prayer, fasting, 
    reading or jihad in a manner that is not in accordance with sharee’ah, etc., 
    his waqf is not valid, rather he should be told not to do this action or to 
    spend on it. 

    Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 31/37. 

    Ibn al-Qayyim said: 

    A waqf is not valid unless it is done as an act or worship 
    and in obedience to Allaah and His Messenger. A waqf is invalid if it is for 
    a shrine or a grave which is lit with lamps and venerated, at which vows are 
    made, to which pilgrimages are performed and at which someone other than 
    Allaah is worshipped, so that the grave becomes like an idol. This is a 
    matter concerning which not one of the imams of Islam or those who followed 
    their paths differed. 

    Zaad al-Ma’aad, 3/507 

    As for how to convince him, that depends on your father’s 
    situation and how convinced he is of Sufism and how much he can understand 
    of what is said to him of evidence. We advise the questioner to pay 
    attention to all these factors when speaking with her father, and to be as 
    gentle as possible with him, and to look for a relative who has knowledge of 
    the Sunnah and can convince him not to set up an innovated waqf or leave 
    instructions to that effect in his will. 

    If she has exhausted all possible means of convincing her 
    father not to set up this innovated waqf in his will, then it is permissible 
    for her to make an outward display of agreeing to his conditions, but she is 
    not obliged to fulfil them – rather she must prevent this bid’ah being 
    established in her house after her father dies, and before he dies if 
    possible, because if someone stipulates a haraam condition, it is not 
    permissible to fulfil it. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: 

    “What is wrong with men who stipulate conditions that are not 
    in the Book of Allaah? Whatever conditions are not in the Book of Allaah are 
    invalid, even if there are one hundred conditions; the decree and conditions 
    of Allaah are more deserving of being fulfilled…”

26192,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26192,Dealing With a Sister Who Doesn’t Pray and is Misbehaved,"What should I do with my younger sister. She does not offer any prayers, she is always telling lies and fighting. The whole house is sick and tired of her.",,,"Praise be to Allah.We appreciate your getting in touch with us, and we ask Allaah to guide us and protect us from the evil of our own selves.
 With regard to your sister’s situation, it is the same in the case of many young people these days. We ask Allaah to guide them and us. Our duty towards them – as it seems to be – is as follows:
 Firstly: we should turn to Allaah and ask Him to guide them, for He is the controller of the hearts. Perhaps a du’aa (supplication) from the heart will be the cause of her happiness in this world and in the Hereafter.
 Secondly: you should stop dealing with her on the basis that she is a child or that she does not know what is in her best interests. People – especially in adolescence – like the people around them to make them feel that they are important; they do not like people to treat them as if they are still children.
 Thirdly: try to get her in touch with righteous young women, and keep her away from her friends who are not good, even if that means changing her school. That should be done without her realizing what is going on, because otherwise she may become more stubborn which will make the problem worse.
 Fourthly: You should not look at her with disapproval only, rather you should express your approval of good things that she does and you should give her gifts if she does good things.
 Fifthly: you could advise her via a person whom she likes, such as a teacher or friend, etc.
 Sixthly: You should try to give her audio materials or books containing teachings in an indirect manner, such as putting them near her or listening to the audio in the car whilst she is riding in it.
 With regard to her not praying, this is an extremely serious matter. The status of prayer in Islam is that of a foundation on which the entire structure rests. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “The covenant that stands between us and them is prayer; whoever does not pray is a kaafir (disbeliever).” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2621; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 2113)
 And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Between a man and shirk (polytheism) and kufr stands his giving up prayer.” (Narrated by Muslim, 82).
 So you have to advise her and preach to her and guide her to the right way; for this purpose you may combine encouragement and threat, gentleness and strictness; if the matter requires some harshness sometimes, there is nothing wrong with using it.
 The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Teach your children to pray when they are seven years old, and hit them (lightly) if they do not pray when they are ten, and separate them in their beds.” (Narrated by Abu Dawood, 495; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 466.
 This strictness and harshness is only in her best interests.

Is this action something that is prescribed and permissible?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Making one’s voice beautiful when reciting Qur’aan is 
    something that is prescribed and was enjoined by the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him). The Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) listened to the recitation of Abu Moosa al-Ash’ari and 
    liked it, and he told him, “You have been given a melodious voice like that 
    of Dawood.” (Muslim, Salaat al-Musaafireen, 793).

    On this basis, if the imam of a mosque imitates a person who 
    has a beautiful voice and recites beautifully in order to make his own voice 
    and recitation of the Book of Allaah more beautiful, this is something which 
    is prescribed for him and for others, because it moves the worshippers 
    praying behind him, and makes them focus, listen and pay attention to the 
    recitation. Allaah bestows His bounty on whomsoever He wills and He is the

    Truly, to Allaah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return. 
    There is no power and no strength except with Allaah, the Exalted, the 
    Almighty! A married man committing sodomy! By Allaah, this is the essence of 
    corruption of man’s nature, absence of faith, lack of shyness, and lack of 
    awareness that the Lord of the Worlds is always watching. 

    Your husband is cursed by Allaah, because the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Cursed is the one who 
    does the action of the people of Loot.” (Narrated by Ahmad, 1878; classed as 
    saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 5891).

     Your husband has committed a great sin, from which he must 
    repent before death comes to him and he is subject to the wrath and 
    vengeance of Allaah and loss in this world and in the Hereafter. See 
    question no. 10050. 

    You have to advise him, after being certain that he has 
    indeed done this, and remind him that Allaah is always watching him and that 
    the Shaytaan is keen to mislead him, so that perhaps he may stop committing 
    this sin. We ask Allaah to keep you safe and sound. 

    Then remind him that one day he will be a father – would he 
    like anyone to commit this sin against his children?! 

    Homosexuality brings disasters to the one who does it, and it 
    causes diseases from which few of those who commit this abhorrent evil 
    action ever escape. It causes distress, anxiety and a sense of alienation in 
    the one who does it and the one to whom it is done. 

    Also, it darkens the face, causes distress, erases light from 
    the face, and makes the face grim, and anyone who has the slightest insight 
    can recognize it. 

    Also, it inevitably leads to alienation, intense hatred and 
    cutting off of ties between the one who does it and the one to whom it is 
    done. 

    Also, it wrecks the lives of the one who does it and the one 
    to whom it is done, in such a way that there is hardly any hope that matters 
    can be put right, unless Allaah wills that they should repent sincerely. 

    Also, it takes away all good things from them, leaving them 
    with the opposite, and it takes away all love and friendship between them, 
    leaving them instead hating and cursing one another.

     It is one of the greatest causes of blessings being lost and 
    of the wrath of Allaah. For it inevitably leads to the curse and wrath of 
    Allaah, and His turning away from the one who does it and not looking at 
    him. What good can he hope for after that, and what evil can he be safe 
    from?

     What kind of life can a person have who is subject to the 
    curse and wrath of Allaah, from whom Allaah has turned away His face and 
    will not look at him? 

    Also, it destroys modesty in general, meaning the modesty 
    which is the life of the heart. When the sense of modesty is lost, ugly 
    things appear beautiful and beautiful things appear ugly. At that point 
    corruption takes over. 

     Also, it generates insolence and impudence like nothing else 
    can.

     Also, it generates contempt, scorn and disdain like nothing 
    else can. 

     And it leads to a person being hated, despised and looked 
    down upon by people, and regarded as beneath contempt, as we seen in real 
    life.

     (From the words of Ibn al-Qayyim in Zaad al-Ma’aad, 
    4/263)

     Modern medical studies have proven that this action causes a 
    great deal of damage in the psyche, minds and bodies of those who commit it. 
    The damage that it does includes the following:

     Its effects on the nerves, brain, reproductive organs, viral 
    infection of the liver. It leads to many serious homosexual diseases, such 
    as syphilis, gonorrhoea, herpes and AIDS. We ask Allaah to keep us safe and 
    sound.

     So you have to remind him of this serious damage. But if he 
    does not stop this sin and give up this evil action, then warn him that you 
    will demand a divorce, and that may make him stop. Note that living with 
    this man – if he does not stop what he is doing – will result you and your 
    children also being exposed to punishment, and you may also contract a 
    disease that he has gotten as a result of his perverse actions. We ask 
    Allaah to make things easy for you and to guide your husband. Ameen.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
26198,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26198,It is not correct to combine ‘Asr with Jumu’ah,"I was traveling and on the way I stopped in a village and prayed Jumu’ah with them. After the prayer I stood up and prayed ‘Asr, i.e., I combined Jumu’ah and ‘Asr. One of my friends was with me and he objected to that, and said that it is not permitted to combine ‘Asr prayer with Jumu’ah. What is the ruling on that?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.What your friend said is correct; Jumu’ah prayer cannot be combined with ‘Asr. Rather what it says in sharee’ah is that Zuhr may be combined with ‘Asr, and Maghrib with ‘Isha’.
Based on this, you have to repeat the ‘Asr prayer that you joined with Jumu’ah, because you offered it before its time, and prayers offered ahead of time are invalid. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen explained the ruling on this issue, as follows: 
It is not permissible to combine ‘Asr with Jumu’ah in the cases where it is permissible to combine Zuhr and ‘Asr. If a traveler passes through a town and prays Jumu’ah with them, it is not permissible for him to combine ‘Asr with it. 
If rain falls and it becomes permissible to combine Zuhr and ‘Asr because of the rain, it is still not permissible to combine ‘Asr with Jumu’ah. If a sick person who is allowed to combine prayers attends Jumu’ah, it is not permissible for him to combine ‘Asr with Jumu’ah. 
The evidence for that is the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, As‑Salaah (the prayer) is enjoined on the believers at fixed hours”
[al-Nisa’ 4:103]
i.e., the prayers must be offered at certain times. Allaah has explained these times in general terms in the verse in which He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Perform As‑Salaah (Iqaamat‑as‑Salaah) from mid‑day till the darkness of the night (i.e. the Zuhr, ‘Asr, Maghrib, and ‘Isha’ prayers), and recite the Qur’aan in the early dawn (i.e. the — Fajr morning prayer). Verily, the recitation of the Qur’aan in the early dawn (i.e. the morning — Fajr prayer) is ever witnessed (attended by the angels in charge of mankind of the day and the night)”
[al-Isra’ 17:78]
The time referred to in this verse – from mid-day until mid-night (the darkness of the night) includes four prayers: Zuhr, ‘Asr, Maghrib and ‘Isha’. These are mentioned together because there is no interruption between their times; as soon as the time for one of them ends, the time for the next one begins. Fajr prayer is mentioned separately because its time is not connected to either the time of ‘Isha’ or the time of Zuhr. 
The Sunnah has explained the times for these prayers in detail, in the hadeeths of ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas, Jaabir and others. It states that the time for Zuhr is from when the sun passes its zenith until the shadow of an object is equal in length to it; the time for ‘Asr is from when the shadow of an object is equal in length to it until the sun sets, but once the sun starts to turn yellow, this is the time of necessity; the time for Maghrib lasts from when the sun sets until the red afterglow disappears; the time for ‘Isha’ is from when the red afterglow has disappeared until halfway through the night; and the time for Fajr is from when dawn begins until the sun rises. These are the times that Allaah has set for the prayers in the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
Whoever offers a prayer before the time defined in the Book of Allaah or the Sunnah of His Messenger is sinning and his prayer is rejected, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And whoever transgresses the limits ordained by Allaah, then such are the Zaalimoon (wrongdoers)”
[al-Baqarah 2:229]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever does any action that is not part of this matter of ours (i.e., Islam) will have it rejected.”  The same applies to one who offers a prayer after its time with no legitimate shar’i excuse. 
Whoever prays Zuhr before the sun has passed its zenith, his prayer is invalid and rejected, and he has to make it up. Whoever prays ‘Asr before the shadow of an object is equal in length to it, his prayer is invalid and rejected and he has to make it up, unless he has a legitimate shar’i excuse that allows him to combine Zuhr and ‘Asr at the time of Zuhr. 
Whoever prays Maghrib before the sun sets, his prayer is invalid and rejected, and he has to make it up. 
Whoever prays ‘Isha’ before the red afterglow has disappeared, his prayer is invalid and rejected, and he has to make it up, unless he has a legitimate shar’i excuse that allows him to combine the two at the time of Maghrib. 
Whoever prays Fajr before dawn comes, his prayer is rejected and he has to make it up. This is what is dictated by the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
Based on this, whoever combines ‘Asr with Jumu’ah has offered the prayer before its time begins, which is when the shadow of an object is equal to its length, so it is invalid and rejected. 
If someone were to say: can we not draw an analogy between combining ‘Asr with Jumu’ah and combining ‘Asr with Zuhr? 
The answer is: this analogy is not correct for several reasons: 
1 – It is an analogy concerning acts of worship. 
2 – Jumu’ah is a separate prayer with its own rulings; it differs from Zuhr in more than twenty rulings. In such a case the two prayers cannot be compared.  
3 – This analogy goes against the apparent meaning of the Sunnah, because in Saheeh Muslim it is narrated from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) combined Zuhr and ‘Asr, and Maghrib and ‘Isha’ in Madeenah at times other than times of fear or rainfall. He was asked about that and he said that he did not want to make things difficult for his ummah. 
There was heavy rainfall that caused hardship at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), but he did not combine ‘Asr with Jumu’ah at that time. It is narrated in Saheeh al-Bukhaari and elsewhere from Anas ibn Maalik that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) prayed for rain one day when he was on the minbar, and he did not descend from the minbar until rain had soaked his beard. Such a thing could not happen except in the case of heavy rain that would have allowed him to combine the prayers, if it were permissible to combine ‘Asr with Jumu’ah. He (Anas) said: The following Friday, a man came in and said: “O Messenger of Allaah, our wealth has been drowned and our buildings have been destroyed; pray to Allaah to withhold it from us.” This implies that water was flowing in the streets, in such a way that it would have allowed them to combine ‘Asr with Jumu’ah, if this combination were permissible. 
If someone were to ask: what is the evidence that it is not allowed to combine ‘Asr with Jumu’ah? 
The answer is that this question is not appropriate, because the basic principle concerning acts of worship is that they should not be done unless there is evidence that they should be done. So we should not question the one who is not doing a certain act of worship about his evidence, rather the one who is doing a certain act of worship should be asked for his evidence, because Allaah says, denouncing those who worship Allaah in ways that are not prescribed in sharee’ah (interpretation of the meaning):  
“Or have they partners with Allaah (false gods) who have instituted for them a religion which Allaah has not ordained?”
[al-Shoora 42:21] 
“This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion”
[al-Maa’idah 5:3]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever does an action that is not part of this matter of ours (i.e., Islam), will have it rejected.” 
Based on this: 
If someone says: what is the evidence that it is not allowed to combine ‘Asr with Jumu’ah? 
We say: What is the evidence that it is permitted? The basic principle is that it is obligatory to offer ‘Asr on time; this principle may be waived when it is combined with another prayer when there is a reason for doing so, but at other times the principle still stands, which is that it should not be offered ahead of time.  
If it is said: What do you think if a person intends Jumu’ah prayer as Zuhr so that he can combine ‘Asr with it? 
The answer is that if the one who is leading Jumu’ah prayer and the people behind him do this, i.e., if the people of a town intend Jumu’ah prayer as Zuhr, then there is no doubt that this is haraam and the prayer is invalid, because Jumu’ah is obligatory for them, and if they ignore it and pray Zuhr instead, then they have turned away from something that is enjoined upon them towards something that they are not commanded to do. So their action is invalid and rejected, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever does an action that is not part of this matter of ours (i.e., Islam), will have it rejected.” 
But if the person who intends Jumu’ah as Zuhr is someone like a traveler who prays behind those who are praying Jumu’ah but intends it as Zuhr so that he can combine ‘Asr with it, this is not valid either, because when he attended Jumu’ah, it became obligatory for him, and whoever is obliged to pray Jumu’ah but prays Zuhr before the imam says the salaam at the end of Jumu’ah, his Zuhr prayer is not valid. Even if this action was valid, he has still missed out on a great deal of good, which is the reward for Jumu’ah prayer. 
The authors of al-Muntaha and al-Iqnaa’ (who are Hanbali scholars) have stated that it is not valid to combine ‘Asr with Jumu’ah; this is mentioned at the beginning of the chapters on Jumu’ah prayer. 
I have spoken about this matter at length because of the need for that. I ask Allaah to help us to do that which is right, for He is the Most Generous.
