20105,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20105,Free Will of Iblis and His Keenness to Lead People Astray,"After a lot of thinking I began to question the shaytan's (devil’s) character. This question might tend to limits, but I was wondering why, if he knows his final destination is Hell, does he strive to do evil? As he is, after all, one among the jinns. Humans divert to evil under the influence of the Shaytan, but under what influence does the Shaytan do evil? Why? Does he not know, with firm confirmation (as he has communicated with Allah) that he is fuel for Hell? As he is a jinn, does not he, like humans, have the freedom of choice?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Iblis and other jinn, and humans, have free will and freedom 
    of choice, to obey Allah or to disobey Him, as Allah says (interpretation of 
    the meaning): 

    “Then whosoever wills, let him believe; and whosoever wills, 
    let him disbelieve.” [18:29] 

    “Verily, We showed him the way, whether he be grateful or 
    ungrateful.” [76:3] 

    Allah commanded Iblis to prostrate to Adam (peace be upon 
    him), but he refused and was arrogant, and was one of the kafirs 
    (disbelievers). So Allah expelled him from His mercy, and cursed him until 
    the Day of Judgement. 

    Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And (remember) when We said to the angels: ‘Prostrate 
    yourselves before Adam.’ And they prostrated except Iblis (Satan), he 
    refused and was proud and was one of the disbelievers (disobedient to 
    Allah).” [2:34] 

    “So the angels prostrated themselves, all of them together.

    Except Iblis (Satan) — he refused to be among the 
    prostrators.

    (Allah) said: ‘O Iblis (Satan)! What is your reason for not 
    being among the prostrators?’

    [Iblis] said: ‘I am not the one to prostrate myself to a 
    human being, whom You created from dried (sounding) clay of altered mud.’

    (Allah) said: ‘Then, get out from here, for verily, you are 
    Rajeem (an outcast or a cursed one).

    And verily, the curse shall be upon you till the Day of 
    Recompense (i.e. the Day of Resurrection).” [15:30-35] 

    Then Iblis asked for a respite until the Day of Resurrection, 
    and Allah granted him that. 

    Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “[Iblis] said: ‘O my Lord! Give me then respite till the Day 
    they (the dead) will be resurrected.’

    Allah said: ‘Then verily, you are of those reprieved,

    Till the Day of the time appointed.’” [15:36-38] 

    When Iblis was certain that he is one of those who are 
    doomed, as well as his being arrogant and being ungrateful to his Lord, he 
    resolved to mislead whomever he could of the slaves of Allah, so that they 
    would be with him in Hell. 

    Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “[Iblis] said: ‘O my Lord! Because You misled me, I shall 
    indeed adorn the path of error for them (mankind) on the earth, and I shall 
    mislead them all.

    Except Your chosen, (guided) slaves among them.’” [15:39, 
    40] 

    He is eager to mislead and corrupt, so as to increase the 
    numbers of his followers and worshippers among the doomed who will share his 
    fate.  

    Iblis knows that his destination is the Fire, and he hopes to 
    take everyone else with him to Hell, out of envy, hatred, kufr (disbelief) 
    and stubbornness. 

    He hates mankind, who are the children of Adam (peace be upon 
    him), and he is hostile towards them because he is cursed and has been 
    banished from the mercy of Allah because of his refusal to prostrate to 
    their father Adam (peace be upon him). Hence Allah has warned His slaves 
    against him and has said (what means): 

    “Surely, Shaytan (Satan) is an enemy to you, so take (treat) 
    him as an enemy. He only invites his hizb (followers) that they may become 
    the dwellers of the blazing Fire.” [35:6] 
Iblis does 
    not need anyone to whisper to him, because he is the source of all evil. 

    The believer can be saved from his plots and traps by obeying 
    his Lord and adhering to His religion, for the shaytaan has no power over 
    those who believe, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “So when you want to recite the Quran, seek refuge with Allah 
    from shaytan, the outcast (the cursed one).

    Verily, he has no power over those who believe and put their 
    trust only in their Lord (Allah).

    His power is only over those who obey and follow him (Satan), 
    and those who join partners with Him (Allah, i.e. those who are mushrikoon, 
    i.e., polytheists).” [16:98-100]

20106,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20106,Marrying an ex-Christian woman who has become Muslim recently and has a child,"I have a very good friend who embraced Islam only a couple of months ago.

She was married and had a child with her Christian husband. The marriage is now annulled after her conversion and she has the custody of the child.  

I want to marry her and support her child but my parents are not allowing me to do so. I am proud to say that I was God's tool for the conversion of this girl. 

But now I face this tough situation. On one hand my parents seriously resisting my wish and are not ready to allow me to marry this girl because she comes from a different culture and society and also has a son from her previous marriage. 
And on the other hand I know that this girl needs a lot of help with her life and religion and I want to help her by marrying her and taking her child as my son.  

Please advise me in the light of Qura'an and Sunnah, whether I should go ahead with my choice and judgement or should I leave her alone according to my parents' will  even after knowing that the only reason they are rejecting her is because she comes from a different country and culture?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Parents have important rights over their 
    children, hence Allaah mentioned the command to honour parents in conjunction with the command to worship Him Alone, as He says: 
“And (remember) when We took a covenant from the Children of Israel, (saying): Worship none but 
    Allaah (Alone) and be dutiful and good to parents”
    [al-Baqarah 2:83] 
“Worship Allaah and join none with Him (in worship); and do good to parents…”
    [al-Nisa’ 4:36] 
“Say (O Muhammad): Come, I will recite what your Lord has prohibited you from: Join not 
    anything in worship with Him; be good and dutiful to your parents…”
[al-An’aam 6:151] 
“And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. And that you be dutiful to your 
    parents. If one of them or both of them attain old age in your life, say not to them a word of disrespect, nor shout at them but address them in 
    terms of honour”
[al-Isra’ 17:23] 
Honouring parents, treating them kindly and 
    striving to please them are among the greatest of good deeds and best of characteristics.  
It is known that a man does not have to marry 
    a particular woman, so if there is a conflict between pleasing his parents and marrying a woman he wants, then he should undoubtedly give 
    precedence to pleasing his parents. 
Al-Tirmidhi (1900) and Ibn Maajah (2089) 
    narrated from Abu’l-Darda’ that a man came to him and said, “I have a wife and my mother is telling me to divorce her.” Abu’l-Darda’ said: “I 
    heard the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say, ‘The father is the best door to Paradise.’ So if you want, you 
    may ignore this door or pay attention to it.” This hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
What Abu’l-Darda’ said has to do with 
    divorce, which is more serious than the issue at hand, because divorce is a very serious matter. Hence the correct view is that you do not have to 
    obey your parents in this matter. (See al-Adab al-Shar’iyyah by Ibn Muflih, 1/447) 
Based on the above, you should try to 
    convince your parents to let you marry this woman. If they insist on refusing then our advice is to obey them. The woman will find a righteous 
    husband to marry in sha Allah, and you will have the reward of having brought her to Islam, praise be to Allaah.

20108,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20108,Women removing hair from the face,"I know it is forbidden for a woman to remove hair from her eyebrows, but what about the rest of the face? Is it permissable for a woman to remove hair from the upperlip or other parts of the face? If the woman is especially hairy?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
It says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (17/133): “It is not permissible to remove the hair of the eyebrows because this is the namas (plucking) for which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed those who do it, and it is a kind of changing the creation of Allah, which is the action of the Shaytaan. If a woman’s husband tells her to do it, she should not obey him, because it is a sin, and there is no obedience to any created being if it involves disobedience towards the Creator. Rather obedience should only be with regard to things that are good and proper, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said.” 
Secondly:
It is permissible to remove any hair from the face apart from the hair of the eyebrows. 
It says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (17/130): “The evidence that it is permissible for a woman to remove hair from her body is the basic principle which states that it required for her to adorn herself for her husband. There is no evidence to suggest that this is not allowed, apart from the prohibition on al-namas (plucking), which means removing hair from the eyebrows.” 
And it also says (5/197): “What is the Islamic ruling on removing hair that grows between the eyebrows? The Committee replied: It is permissible to pluck it, because it is not part of the eyebrows.”

          If there is no need to learn it, then do not occupy your time with that 
          or let it distract you from things which are more important and more 
          beneficial. People vary with regard to how much they need to learn English. 
          The Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded Ibn Thaabit to

Also,is it preferable to wear this type of clothing instead of Western clothing ,if one is able to do so,while living in Western countries?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) wore the thawb (qamees), the rida’ and izaar (upper and lower garment) and sirwaal (pants). With regard to the Pakistani dress (shalwar khameez), it is not narrated – as far as we know – that the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) wore this type of dress. 
Undoubtedly adhering to this Arabic dress 
    comes under the heading of preserving the ummah’s customs and unique characteristics, and protecting it from imitation of others and assimilation. 
    This is undoubtedly better than western dress. 
However, clothing is considered to come under 
    the heading of traditions, and each country has its own traditions and customs, and there is nothing wrong with a Muslim following the traditions 
    of the country he lives in with regard to dress, on condition that it does not include anything haraam in the material of which it is made or the 
    way in which it is designed. So it is not permissible to wear silk, or tight clothing, or see-through fabrics that show the ‘awrah, or clothing 
    that belongs uniquely to the kuffaar or that is made of silk. 
Neither is it permissible to wear “garments 
    of fame and vanity” – which means things that a person becomes famous for wearing – because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “Whoever wears a garment of fame and vanity, Allaah will clothe him in a similar garment on the Day of Resurrection.” A report

Umm Haraam was the daughter of Milhaan (may Allaah be pleased with him), and was the sister of 
    Umm Sulaym. Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said: I could not find out her real name.  
They were both mahrams of the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
Al-Bukhaari (2789) and Muslim (1912) narrated 
    from Anas ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him) that he heard him say that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be

    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) entered upon her, and she provided him with food and started grooming his 
    head. Then the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) slept, then he woke up smiling. Umm Haraam asked, ""What makes 
    you smile, O Messenger of Allaah?"" He said, ""Some people of my ummah were shown to me (in my dream) fighting for the sake of Allaah, sailing in 
    the middle of the seas like kings on the thrones or like kings sitting on their thrones."" (The narrator Ishaq is not sure as to which expression 
    was correct). Umm Haraam added, ""I said, 'O Messenger of Allaah! Pray to Allaah to make me one of them.' "" So the Messenger of Allaah  (peace

    Haraam added): I said, ""What makes you smile, O Messenger of Allaah?"" He said, ""Some people of my ummah were shown to me (in my dream) fighting 
    for the sake of Allaah."" He said the same as he had said before. I said, ""O Messenger of Allaah! Pray to Allaah to make me one of them."" He said, 
    ""You will be among the first ones."" Then Umm Haraam sailed across the sea during the Caliphate of Mu’aawiya ibn Abi Sufyaan, and she fell down 
    from her riding animal after coming ashore, and died. 
Muslim (2331) narrated that Anas ibn Maalik 
    said: The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to enter Umm Sulaym’s house and sleep on her mattress when she was not 
    there. He came one day and slept on her mattress, then someone went to her and said to her, “The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) is sleeping in your house on your bed.” She came and saw that he had sweated and his sweat had soaked a piece of cloth that was on the 
    mattress. She opened her box and started collecting that sweat and squeezing it into bottles. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) woke with a start and said, “What are you doing, O Umm Sulaym?” She said, “O Messenger of Allaah, we hope for the barakah (blessing) of 
    this sweat for our children.” He said, “You are right.” 
Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him)

“The scholars are agreed that Umm Haraam was 
    a mahram of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), but they differed as to how that came about. Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr and others

“Umm Haraam was the sister of Umm Sulaym, and 
    they were maternal aunts of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his mahrams, either through radaa’ah or

    permit adultery, silk, alcohol and musical instruments…” This was narrated by al-Bukhaari in a mu’allaq report, no. 5590. al-Tabaraani and

Some contemporary scholars make an exception 
    for military music, but there is no basis for that at all, for several reasons: 
1 – This is making an exemption from the 
    general meaning of the hadeeth when there are no grounds for doing so, apart from personal opinion and judgement. This is invalid. 
2 – At times of war, the Muslims are obliged 
    to turn with all their hearts to their Lord, and to ask Him to support them against their enemies.  This will bring them greater peace of mind and 
    keep them steadfast and calm. Using music is something that will spoil that and distract them from remembering Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation 
    of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! When you meet (an 
    enemy) force, take a firm stand against them and remember the Name of Allaah much (both with tongue and mind), so that you may be successful”
[al-Anfaal 8:45]

    them, especially in matters that Allaah has forbidden to us in general terms, such as music.

20130,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20130,Our worries are bothering us a great deal!,"My question is about a problem that my husband and I are suffering from, namely that we think about every little thing and we worry a great deal. This is affecting our worship; all the time we think about the worries and problems that we are going through. Is there any solution to this?",,,"Praise be to Allah.I thank you for your trust and ask Allaah to give us and you strength and wisdom, and to show us what is true and help us to follow it, and to show us what is false and help us to avoid it, and not to let it confuse us and lead us astray… With regard to what you asked about, my comments on it are as follows: 
1 –Thinking about the matters of our daily lives, and our private and public affairs is something that is essential and important, it is necessary in order for us to deal with these matters and benefit from them in the appropriate manner. The Qur’aan – which is the word of Allaah – urges us to think, in more than one verse, for example: 
“…and think deeply about the creation of the heavens and the earth, (saying): Our Lord! You have not created (all) this without purpose…” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:191] 
“And on the earth are signs for those who have Faith with certainty.
And also in your ownselves. Will you not then see?” [al-Dhaariyaat 51:20-21] 
“Will you not then take thought?” [al-An’aam 6:50] 
“Have you then no understanding?”[al-Baqarah 2:76]
And there are other verses which encourage us to think about our affairs and indeed about the life and creation around us. 
So thinking in and of itself is not a problem, rather it is required, important and essential, and it is enjoined by our religion and encouraged by our Qur’aan. 
2 – This “thinking” may become a psychological or social problem if it prevents a person from playing his natural role that is expected of him in life. 
Such as thinking that things are more serious than they really are, or thinking too much about matters where thinking about them will not change anything at all, rather that only causes distress and becomes an obstacle prevents one from taking any initiative, and make him hesitant and confused, and unable to take any decision. 
Thinking may become a problem in shar’i terms if it makes a person go beyond his intellectual limits in thinking about matters of the unseen and things that he can never comprehend, which may open many doors for the accursed Shaytaan to influence him. 
3 – With regard to thinking a great deal about everything and worrying about every problem, this is to some extent a natural thing, so long as it does not prevent you from living your lives in a natural manner. What I mean here is, is this thinking helping you to come up with solutions to these problems that you are facing? Do these situations deserve all the time that you are spending on thinking about them? If the answer is yes, then there is no problem! But if the answer is no, then you yourself are admitting that they do not warrant that, and then you are halfway to solving the problem, which is to identify the problem and take a decision concerning it. Because when we know what the problem is, it is easy for us to find the right way of dealing with it. 
4 – Overcoming these problems needs some discipline and some time. You can make the decision to start and you are able, with the help and support of Allaah, to do that. You have to trust yourselves in this regard! 
5 – I suggest to you that you divide your concerns and problems into three categories or levels: 
·Concerns and problems that have a direct impact upon your married and social lives in a serious manner that may lead to breakdown in relationships. These must be given their due measure of objective thought and you should try to reach an agreement and settle the matter. They should not be ignored for so long that it becomes too difficult to deal with them.
·The second level is concerns or problems in which the positive and negative aspects are equal and in which you are involved. In these cases you should pray istikhaarah to Allaah, and it is o.k. to consult others concerning them and to weigh up alternatives, then decide what you think is the solution, bearing in mind issues of sharee’ah and custom, without going to extremes in worrying about it.
·The third level is concerns and worries that do not concern you at all, because they have to do with other people. It is better not to get involved in them and waste your time with them, because they simply do not concern you and your opinion does not matter.
6 – The concerns and matters of our daily lives inevitably fall into one of three categories: 
·Matters which are in the past and are over and done with. We should not worry about these too much, except to the extent from which we can learn from our mistakes and experiences when dealing with things in the future. The past cannot come back and there is no need to worry about things that are over and done with.
·Matters which lay ahead in the future. It is more appropriate not to think about these a great deal before they happen, because the future is part of the unseen, and all that we have to do in this case is to examine the choices we have in this matter if it comes to pass. When the time comes, we have to put our trust in Allaah and take a decision.
·Matters of day-to-day life. This is where we attempt to weigh up all the available alternatives, and it is o.k. to consult others with regard to these things and to exchange ideas without going to extremes or worrying too much. In the end, things will turn out as we hope, by Allaah’s leave, so long as we pursue the means of praying istikhaarah and consulting others, and good lies in that which is chosen by Allaah.
7 – Getting used to this requires some discipline. You could agree with your husband to cooperate in this matter and remind one another when you are worrying more than you need to about a matter. Gradually you will find that you are becoming able to deal with day-to-day matters in an objective manner. 
8 – There is a good book on the topic of anxiety which gives practical means of dealing with this matter, and I advise you to read it. It is called How to Stop Worrying and Start Living by Dale Carnegie. 
9 – First and last, have a good intention and pray sincerely that Allaah will give you strength and help you and set your thinking straight.",Ahmad al-Muqbil : (islam Today)

20153,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20153,Refutation of one who casts aspersions upon Saheeh al-Bukhaari,My Shia friend have posed a question to me as to how we can claim Sahih Bkhari to be Authentic when Imam Bukhari (May Allah Mercy be upon him) was present 400 years after the death of the Prophet.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Imam al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) died in 256 AH, i.e., 245 years after the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) died, not as your Shi’i friend claims. But these people are natural liars so this claim comes as no surprise. That does not mean that al-Bukhaari could have narrated directly from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him); this is not what is meant at all. Rather we mention this here for the purpose of making things clear. 
But how can we depend upon Saheeh al-Bukhaari when al-Bukhaari never met the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in person? 
The answer is that in his Saheeh, al-Bukhaari did not narrate anything directly from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), rather he narrated from trustworthy shaykhs, who attained the highest degree of memorization, precision and trustworthiness, who in turn had narrated from equally reliable shaykhs, all the way back to the Sahaabah who narrated from the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). The smallest number of narrators between al-Bukhaari and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is three. So we rely upon Saheeh al-Bukhaari because he chose the narrators from whom he transmitted hadeeth with the utmost care, and they are the most trustworthy. Moreover, he would not write down any hadeeth in his Saheeh until he had done ghusl, then prayed two rak’ahs and prayed istikhaarah, asking Allaah to guide him with regard to writing down this hadeeth; then he would write it down. It took him sixteen years to write this book, which the ummah accepted and unanimously agreed that what is narrated in it is saheeh; and Allaah has protected this ummah from agreeing upon misguidance. 
Imam al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his introduction to Sharh Muslim (1/14): “The scholars (may Allaah have mercy on them) are agreed that the most sound of books after the Qur’aan are the two Saheehs of al-Bukhaari and Muslim, which were accepted by the ummah. The book of al-Bukhaari is the more sound and the more beneficial of the two.” 
If you ask this Shi’i (or Raafidi) about the sayings of ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him) that their leaders have transmitted, and the sayings of al-Baaqir and Ja’far al-Saadiq, and others of Ahl al-Bayt (may Allaah have mercy on them), whether they heard them from them or transmitted them with isnaads (chains of narrators), the answer will be clear. There is a great difference between the isnaads of al-Bukhaari and the isnaads of these misguided people who cannot find the names of their chain of narrators in the reports except in the books of the weak narrators, liars and deficient narrators. 
The claim made by this Raafidi (Shi’i) is simply the first step in attacking the Sunnah which demonstrates that their madhhab is false and their beliefs are corrupt. They cannot help but try to stir up trouble with these misguided notions. But they can never succeed, for the truth is clear and falsehood is confused.
 Moreover we advise you – may Allaah help you – to look for Sunni friends from whose company you can benefit, and to avoid making friends with followers of bid’ah. The scholars have warned against making friends with them because they will keep on trying until they take a person far away from the truth by using all kinds of wiles and causing confusion.
 We ask Allaah to help us and you to follow the Sunnah and to keep away from bid’ah and those who follow it.

20154,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20154,They agreed to give the mahr in gold instead of cash. What is the ruling?,"I was married eight years back however until now I did not pay my Mahr but I am planning to give it know, which is Indian rupees 7,000. Instead of money (cash) I want to give her gold ornaments of equivalent or more cash. Besides I had asked her does she needs cash or gold, she said that it is up to me. Please advice me? How to pay my mahr back?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The basic principle is that the man is obliged to give the 
    mahr that he stipulated to the woman. If they agree on something different, 
    or on more or less, then that is permissible, because Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “but if after a Mahr is prescribed, you agree mutually (to 
    give more), there is no sin on you”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:24]
Al-Qurtubi (may Allaah 
    have mercy on him) said: “This means, giving more or less in the mahr, for 
    that is allowed when there is mutual agreement, after the mahr has been 
    agreed upon.” (Tafseer al-Qurtubi, 5/235). 

    Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan said: “If she gives him part of it – 
    part of the mahr – there is nothing wrong with that. If she lets him off 
    paying all or part of the mahr, she has the right to do so. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    ‘but if they, of their own good pleasure, remit any part 
    of it to you, take it, and enjoy it without fear of any harm (as Allaah has 
    made it lawful)’

    [al-Nisa’ 4:4]
This is dependent on 
    agreement from both parties.” 

    (Fataawa Noor ‘ala’l-Darb, 109). 

    So it is clear from this that if the woman agrees to this, 
    there is nothing wrong with that because this is her right.

This also includes not being able to do ghusl when one is junub (in a state of impurity following sexual activity); whoever is not able to do ghusl because he is sick or it is very cold may do tayammum instead and he does not have to repeat his prayers, because of the hadeeth of ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas who said: “I had a wet dream on a cold night during the campaign of Dhaat al-Salaasil, and I was scared that if I did ghusl I might die. So I did tayammum and prayed, then in the morning my companions mentioned that to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). He said, ‘O ‘Amr, you led your companions in prayer when you were junub.’ I told him what had kept me from doing ghusl and I said, ‘I heard that Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And do not kill yourselves. Surely, Allah is Most Merciful to you” [al-Nisa’ 4:29].’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) smiled and did not say anything.”

    Undoubtedly the issue of women and doctors is an important 
    matter, and in fact it causes a great deal of trouble. But if Allaah blesses 
    a woman with taqwa (piety) and insight, then she will take precautions and 
    pay attention to this matter. She should not be alone with the doctor and 
    the doctor should not be alone with her. The authorities [in Saudi Arabia] 
    have issued orders and directives stating that this is not allowed. Women 
    must also pay attention to this matter and should try to seek competent 
    female doctors. If they find a female doctor, then praise be to Allaah and 
    there is no need for a male doctor. But if a woman needs to see a male 
    doctor because there are no female doctors, then in the case of necessity 
    there is nothing wrong with her being examined and treated by him. This is 
    one of the things that are permitted in case of necessity, but if she has to 
    uncover part of her body then she should not do that if she is alone with 
    the doctor, rather it should be in the presence of her mahram or husband, if 
    it involves uncovering something ordinary like the head, hand or foot, etc. 
    If her ‘awrah must be uncovered then she should have her husband with her, 
    if she is married, or another woman, which is better and is more on the safe 
    side; or there should be one or two nurses present. But if another woman, 
    apart from the nurse, can be with her, this is better and is more on the 
    safe side and more removed from suspicion. But as for being alone with the

	Muslim narrated that Abu 
	Hurayrah said: “Some of the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings 
	of Allah be upon him) came to him and said, ‘We find things in our hearts 
	that none of us would dare to utter out loud.’ He said, ‘Do you really find 
	that?’ They said, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘That is clear faith.’” 

	Muslim narrated that ‘Uthman 
	ibn Abi’l-‘As came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) 
	and said: “O Messenger of Allah, the Shaytan is coming between me and my 
	prayer and making me confused in my recitation.” The Messenger of Allah 
	(peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “That is a devil called 
	Khanzab. If you feel his presence, then seek refuge with Allah from him and 
	spit drily to your left three times.” [‘Uthman] said: “I did that and Allah 
	took him away from me.” 

	Al-Bukhari and Muslim narrated 
	that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of 
	Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘The Shaytan comes to 
	some of you and says, “Who created such and such? Who created such and 
	such?” – until he says, “Who created your Lord?” If that happens, then let 
	him seek refuge with Allah and stop thinking about that.’” 

	Al-Bukhari and Muslim narrated 
	that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of 
	Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘When the call for 
	prayer (adhan) is given, the Shaytan runs away, breaking wind loudly so as 
	not to hear the adhan. When the adhan ends, he comes back. When the iqamah 
	(final call to prayer) is made, he runs away, then when the iqamah ends, he 
	comes back to distract a man from his prayer, saying, “Remember such and 
	such,” things that the man did not remember, until he does not know how many 
	rak’ahs (units of prayer) he has prayed. If one of you does not know how 
	many rak’ahs he has prayed, whether it is three or four, then let him do two 
	prostrations whilst he is sitting.” 

	Muslim narrated that Abu Sa’eed 
	al-Khudri said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be 
	upon him) said, ‘If one of you is uncertain about his prayer and cannot 
	remember how many rak’ahs he has prayed, whether it was three or four, then 
	let him avoid doubt and act upon that of which he is certain, then let him 
	do two prostrations before he says the salam (conclusion of prayer). Then if 
	he prayed five rak’ahs they will make his prayer even, and if he prayed four 
	then that will annoy the Shaytan.” 

	These ayahs (verses) and 
	ahadeeth (prophetic traditions) show just how keen the Shaytan is to lead 
	the sons of Adam astray and stop them from worshipping their Lord, by means 
	of the waswas (whispers) which he instils in their hearts. But the way to 
	save oneself from these devilish whispers is made clear. For some people the 
	matter may go so far that they have doubts about every act of worship they 
	try to do, whether they have even done it or not. The question here is not 
	whether such a person is to blame, rather the question is whether a person 
	will be rewarded for his striving against the Shaytan and his efforts to 
	resist these whispers, or not. 

	There is no clear statement 
	from the scholars on this matter, but it may be understood from the words of 
	the two Shaykhs, Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on 
	them), that he will be rewarded for that. This is what is to be understood 
	from the texts quoted above, as we shall see below. 

	In the first hadeeth, the 
	Sahabah (Companions) asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon 
	him) about the waswas that they felt in their hearts, and he said, “That is 
	clear faith.” Shaykh al-Islam (Majmoo’ al-Fatawa, 7/282) said: “In other 
	words, the fact that this waswas was happening and they disliked it so much 
	and pushed it away from their hearts is clear faith, like the mujahid 
	(warrior) to whom the enemy comes and he resists him until he defeats him, 
	and this is the greatest form of jihad (battle). Clear (sareeh) means pure, 
	like pure milk. It becomes clear and pure because they hated those devilish 
	whispers and warded them off, so their faith became pure and clear.” 

	He also said (Majmoo’ al-Fatawa, 
	14/108): 

	“This waswasah is something that 
	involuntarily enters the heart of a person, and if a person hates it and 
	shuns it, this hatred of it is clear faith.” 

	He also said (Majmoo’ al-Fatawa, 
	22/608): 

	“Many of the scholars said: 
	hating that, disliking it and shunning it is clear faith. Praise be to Allah 
	that the most the Shaytan can do is whisper, for when the devil from the 
	jinn is defeated, it whispers (waswasah) and when the human devil is 
	defeated, he lies. Waswas affects everyone who tries to focus on Allah in 
	his worship and dhikr (remembrance of Allah) etc. So one has to be steadfast 
	and patient and persist in dhikr or prayer; he should not feel distressed 
	because if he persists, that will divert the plot of the Shaytan away from 
	him, for the plot of the Shaytan is weak.” 

	And he said in Dar al-Ta’arud, 
	3/318:  

	“This waswas may be gotten rid 
	of by seeking refuge with Allah and ignoring it, so that if [the Shaytan] 
	says, ‘you did not wash your face,’ you should say, ‘Yes, I did wash my 
	face;’ if he thinks that he did not form the intention (for prayer) or say 
	Allahu akbar, he should say in his heart, ‘Yes I did form the intention and 
	say Allahu akbar.’ He should cling steadfastly to the truth and ward off the 
	waswas that goes against it, so that the Shaytan will see how strong and 
	steadfast he is in adhering to the truth, and will leave him alone. 
	Otherwise when he (the Shaytan) sees that he is influenced by doubts and 
	responsive to waswas, he will send him more waswas until he will be unable 
	to resist and his heart will become receptive to the seductive whispers of 
	the devils of the jinn and of mankind, and he will move from one thing to 
	another until the Shaytan drives him to his doom. 

	Based on the above, we may say 
	that a man will be rewarded for resisting this waswas and for striving 
	against the Shaytan for a number of reasons: 

	1 – The Prophet (peace and 
	blessings of Allah be upon him) praised the feeling of hatred towards the 
	waswas that had to do with doubts concerning belief (‘aqeedah) when he said, 
	“That is clear faith.” One of the things implied by the hatred of this 
	waswas is that one turns away from it and does not get carried away with 
	it. 

	2 – Obeying the command of the 
	Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “Let him stop it.” 

	3 – The Prophet (peace and 
	blessings of Allah be upon him) said concerning the prostration of 
	forgetfulness (sajdat al-sahw): “They will annoy the Shaytan.” This implies 
	encouragement to annoy and humiliate the Shaytan. Annoying him here means 
	turning away from this waswas and not paying any attention to it. This is in 
	addition to the fact that Allah and His Messenger have taught us to seek 
	refuge with Allah from the Shaytan, etc. 

	4 – The difficulties and 
	distress that the believer may suffer as a result of this waswas may be 
	included in the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon 
	him), “No Muslim suffers tiredness, exhaustion, worry, grief, annoyance or 
	distress, not even a thorn that pricks him, but Allah will expiate some of 
	his sins thereby.”
	(al-Bukhari, Muslim). 

	5 – Shaykh al-Islam (Ibn 
	Taymiyah – may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Like the mujahid to whom the 
	enemy comes and he resists him until he defeats him, and this is the 
	greatest form of jihad.” The fact that he likens him to a mujahid and 
	describes this as the greatest form of jihad may be understood to mean that 
	he will be rewarded for that.

    There is no report of any specific virtue attached to 
    cleaning the mosque, except that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) commanded that the mosque should be cleaned and 
    perfumed. It was narrated that Samurah ibn Jundub said: “The Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded us to set 
    up mosques among our houses and commanded us to clean them.” (Narrated by 
    Ahmad in his Musnad, 19671; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in 
    Saheeh al-Targheeb wa’l-Tarheeb, 278). 

    And it was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah said: “The Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded that 
    mosques should be built among the houses (i.e., in each neighbourhood), and 
    that they should be cleaned and perfumed.” (narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 594; 
    classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Targheeb wa’l-Tarheeb, 
    279). 
These two ahaadeeth refer 
    to the command of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him), and the one who obeys the command of the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) will be rewarded. 

    It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that a black man (or a 
    black woman) used to clean the mosque, and he died. The Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) asked about him, and they said that he 
    had died. He said, “Why did you not tell me? Show me his grave.” (Or he 
    said, “her grave.”) So he went to her grave and offered the funeral prayer 
    for her. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 458; Muslim, 956). 

    Ibn Hajar said in Fath al-Baari, “The hadeeth 
    indicates the virtue of cleaning the mosque, enquiring after servants and 
    after friends if they are absent.” 

    Moreover, for the Muslim to do an act of worship or obedience 
    it is sufficient for him to know that this is the command of Allaah and His 
    Messenger. This is a sign of complete submission to the teachings of Islam, 
    but there is nothing wrong with asking about the reason behind it or the 
    reward for it, in order to feel more content with doing it. 

    Note: there is a da’eef (weak) hadeeth about the virtue of 
    cleaning the mosque, which says, “Sweeping the mosque is the dowry of al-hoor 
    al-‘iyn.” (al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah, 4147), The saheeh reports 
    narrated above are sufficient. And Allaah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
20161,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20161,How to Control Sexual Desire in Islam,"I am a young married girl of twenty-one, my desires rule over me and leave me restless, confused, frustrated and resentful. Tell me how to get rid of sexual desires in Islam?","You can control your sexual desire by: 1- reducing and weakening the things that may provoke the desire, 2- strengthening the factors that will prevent you from acting in accordance with your desires.",,"Praise be to Allah.Sexual desire is something that has been created in mankind and it cannot be got rid of . Getting rid of it is not something that is required of the Muslim; rather what is required of him is to refrain from using it in forbidden ways, and to use it in the ways that Allah has permitted. 
The problem of sexual desire in a young woman may be solved by taking two steps. 
1.      The first step is to reduce and weaken the things that may provoke desire in a person. This may be achieved in a number of ways, including the following: 
·         Lowering the gaze and refraining from looking at that which Allah has forbidden. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts).” [An-Nur 24:31]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not follow one glance with another, for the first [unintentional one] is pardoned but not the second.” There are many sources of prohibited looking, such as looking directly at young men and thinking about their attractive looks, or looking at pictures in magazines and movies. 
·         Avoiding reading stories and novels which focus on the sexual aspect , and avoiding reading internet websites which deal with such topics. 
·         Keeping away from bad company. 
·         Avoiding thinking about desire as much as possible. Thinking in and of itself is not prohibited, but if one thinks about it for too long, that may lead a person to prohibited actions. 
·         Spending one's time in useful pursuits, because spare time may lead one to fall into prohibited things. 
·         Avoiding as much as possible going to public places where young men and women mix . 
·         If a girl is tested with studying in a mixed environment , and cannot find any alternative, she has to remain modest, serious and dignified, and should avoid sitting with young men and speaking to them as much as possible. She should restrict her relationships to friendships with righteous female classmates. 
2.                  The second step is to strengthen the factors that will prevent one acting in accordance with one’s desires. This is achieved in a number of ways, including the following: 
·         Strengthening the faith in one’s heart and strengthening one’s relationship with Allah. This may be achieved by remembering Allah a great deal, reading the Quran, thinking of the Names and Attributes of Allah, and doing a lot of Sunnah prayers. Belief strengthens the heart and soul, and it helps one to resist temptation. 
·         Fasting , as taught by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he said: “O young men, whoever among you can afford to, let him get married, for it is more effective in lowering the gaze and in guarding one’s chastity. Whoever cannot afford it, then let him fast, for it will be a shield for him.” This is addressed to young men, but it also includes young women. 
·         Strengthening one’s resolve and willpower, for this will make a young woman able to resist and control her desires. 
·         Remembering what Allah has prepared for righteous young women. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, the Muslims (those who submit to Allah in Islam) men and women, the believers men and women (who believe in Islamic Monotheism), the men and the women who are obedient (to Allah), the men and women who are truthful (in their speech and deeds), the men and the women who are patient (in performing all the duties which Allah has ordered and in abstaining from all that Allah has forbidden), the men and the women who are humble (before their Lord Allah), the men and the women who give Sadaqat (i.e. Zakah and alms), the men and the women who observe Sawm (fast) (the obligatory fasting during the month of Ramadan, and the optional Nawafil fasting), the men and the women who guard their chastity (from illegal sexual acts) and the men and the women who remember Allah much with their hearts and tongues. Allah has prepared for them forgiveness and a great reward (i.e. Paradise).” [Al-Ahzab 33:35]
·         Thinking about the lives of righteous women who guarded their chastity, such as Maryam, whom Allah praises in the Quran (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And Maryam (Mary), the daughter of ‘Imran who guarded her chastity. And We breathed into (the sleeve of her shirt or her garment) through Our Ruh [i.e. Gabriel], and she testified to the truth of the Words of her Lord [i.e. believed in the Words of Allah: “Be!” and he was; that is `Isa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary) as a Messenger of Allah], and (also believed in) His Scriptures, and she was of the Qanitun (i.e. obedient to Allah).” [At-Tahrim 66:12]
And thinking about the immoral, fallen women, and comparing between the two types, for there is a huge difference between them. 
·         Choosing righteous companions and spending time with them, so that they can help one another to obey and worship Allah. 
·         Comparing the effects of immediate fulfillment of desire when a girl responds to prohibited, which is followed by loss of pleasure and all that is left is regret and sorrow, with patience and striving against one’s whims and desires, and realising that the pleasure of conquering one’s whim and desires is far greater than the pleasures of enjoying prohibited things. 
·         Seeking help by calling upon Allah and asking Him for help. The Quran tells us the lesson to be learned from the story of Yusuf (peace be upon him): 
“He said: ‘O my Lord! Prison is dearer to me than that to which they invite me. Unless You turn away their plot from me, I will feel inclined towards them and be one (of those who commit sin and deserve blame or those who do deeds) of the ignorant’
 So his Lord answered his invocation and turned away from him their plot. Verily, He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower.” [Yusuf 12:33 – interpretation of the meaning]

20162,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20162,She married her boyfriend and is living a miserable life with him,"I left home at XXX and married my XXX yr old college boyfriend ( I know it was wrong please don't judge me) i now live with his family and have a little 1 yr old girl. The problem is I want to try and bring my daughter up as religiously as possible I maybe destined for hell but i do not wish to drag my daughter with me. I feel that my husband is not giving me this opportunity or his family. They care about my daughter but constantly listen to music and watch tv I hate this because my daughter is begining to enjoy this sort of thing and do not want my daughter exposed to this. The main problem is I regret marrying my husband with all my heart I feel that he regrets it too.We argue All the time about his family and money. I can't stand talking to him because he is always miserable and does not know where he is going in life or what he is to do. he can't hold a job because he gets 'bored' easily i work and so does he but he still can't even provide for us he spends all his money and can not answer for it. I have to provide for me and my daughter and on most occasions for him we earn the same amount and yet I am able to save for the future while he spends it like water.he behaves as if he were a single person with no worries,The only reason we are together is because of my daughter. I wish i could leave because I am so unhappy I am a wreck. i have lost all self esteem. I went for sweet talk/excitment in a man rather then religion and character and i realise now that this is the most important thing in a man because a man who follows religion correctly and is of good character is a better husband.

I myself am a weak muslim i need someone to guide me and although my husband went to Madrasha he does not bother with religion and right and wrong of religion. he wants me to slave for him and his family and does not care for what i want. I want to know what Islam says about us being together. Does my happiness count at all because I see a very bleak future with my husband. but i know i can not cope without my family who will probably disown me if I left my husband. But they understand that i am going through alot. we seperated for awhile and I stayed with my family but he came back apolagising this was a few months ago. I care for my husband because once we were sort of happy but we have lost each other we have lost the love and friendship we once had. I don't think we will get that back. We live together but lead almost separate lives. 

Please advise me as to what I can do for my future and the future of my daughter. I do not want to deprive her of her father but my marriage is a unhappy one believe me.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The story you tell in your question in and of itself offers a 
    serious lesson to every girl who follows her whims and desires, fails to 
    obey Allaah and leaves her family and her home in order to commit sin in an 
    atmosphere of fitnah. Your question also offers a lesson to every sinner, to 
    look at the consequences to which their sin may lead them. We ask Allaah to 
    forgive us, you and every Muslim man and woman. 

    With regard to the marriage contract between you and him, if 
    it was not done in the presence of your guardian and with his approval – 
    which is what seems to be the case – then it is not valid, and it is haraam 
    for you to stay with him in this case or to let him be intimate with you, 
    because he is not your husband. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said, “There is no marriage (nikaah) without a guardian 
    (wali).” And he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Any 
    woman who gets married without the permission of her guardian, her marriage 
    is invalid, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid.” 

    I advise you to do a number of things: 

    1 – You must ask him to put this matter right, by making a 
    new marriage contract with you, with a mahr (dowry) and the presence of your 
    guardian and two witnesses. From what you say it seems that your family now 
    approve of your marriage to him. So there is nothing to prevent you putting 
    this haraam situation right. If that is not done then he is not your 
    husband, and it is haraam for you to stay with him. 

    2 – I advise you to be patient and to seek reward with Allaah 
    for the difficulties and stress that you are facing. For these difficulties 
    will be an expiation for your previous sins. The Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No worry or grief befalls a 
    believer, not even a thorn that pricks him, but Allaah will expiate thereby 
    some of his sins.” Your patience will end in a way out, in sha Allah. As the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The way out 
    comes with patience.” 

    3 – Note that unpleasant things only happen to people because 
    of their sins. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And whatever of misfortune befalls you, it is because of 
    what your hands have earned. And He pardons much”

    [al-Shoora 42:30]
The difficulties and 
    unhappiness that you are going through may be a punishment from Allaah for 
    your disobeying your family and committing this haraam action. But your 
    regret and putting this matter right, in sha Allaah, will be your 
    repentance, for the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said: “Regret is repentance.” I hope that Allaah will take away from you, as 
    a result of this repentance, the worry and distress that you are feeling. 
4 – Make a lot of du’aa’ 
    and feel that you are in need of Allaah and have no one else to turn to. 
    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Is not He (better 
    than your gods) Who responds to the distressed one, when he calls on Him, 
    and Who removes the evil…?”[al-Naml 27:62] 
“And your Lord said: 
    “Invoke Me [i.e. believe in My Oneness (Islamic Monotheism) and ask Me for 
    anything] I will respond to your (invocation)”[Ghaafir 40:60]
If a person is helped (by 
    Allaah) to make du’aa’, then his prayer will be answered. Make the most of 
    the times and places where du’aa’ is answered, such as when prostrating, 
    before saying the tasleem at the end of the prayer, in the last third of the 
    night, and on Fridays, especially after ‘Asr prayer. 
5 – You have to advise 
    your husband and cooperate with him in obeying Allaah. Take him by the hand 
    and start a new life in which your aim is to please Allaah. May Allaah help 
    you both to do that which He loves and which pleases Him. And Allaah knows 
    best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
20163,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20163,Dealing with the lack of interest in seeking knowledge,One may note that there is a lack of interest and apathy towards seeking knowledge. What are the ways and means of stirring up interest in seeking knowledge?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Lack of interest in seeking Islamic knowledge is a major calamity. There are a number of things which we must do, including the following: 
1 – sincerity of intention towards Allaah in seeking knowledge. If a person is sincere towards Allaah in his pursuit of knowledge, and knows that he will be rewarded for his efforts and that he will be in the third level of the ummah, then his interest will be increased. 
“And whoso obey Allaah and the Messenger (Muhammad), then they will be in the company of those on whom Allaah has bestowed His Grace, of the Prophets, the Siddiqoon (those followers of the Prophets who were first and foremost to believe in them, like Abu Bakr As-Siddeeq), the martyrs, and the righteous. And how excellent these companions are!”
[al-Nisaa’ 4:69 – interpretation of the meaning]
2 – keeping company with friends who will encourage you to seek knowledge and will help you to discuss and research, and you will not got bored of their company so long as they help you to gain knowledge. 
3 – Being patient with yourself, by disciplining yourself when you want to turn away. Allaah said to His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him):  
“And keep yourself (O Muhammad) patiently with those who call on their Lord (i.e. your companions who remember their Lord with glorification, praising in prayers, and other righteous deeds) morning and afternoon, seeking His Face; and let not your eyes overlook them, desiring the pomp and glitter of the life of the world”
[al-Kahf 18:28 – interpretation of the meaning]
So be patient, for if you are patient and get used to seeking knowledge, that will become a characteristic of yours. Then a day when you have no opportunity for seeking knowledge becomes a long (i.e., boring) day. But if you give yourself free rein in following your whims and desires, this is wrong, because the soul is inclined towards evil, and the Shaytaan encourages people to be lazy and not to learn.","From Fataawa al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, Kitaab al-‘Ilm, P. 105"
20165,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20165,Fasting while Traveling: Permissible?,"If a person travels in Ramadan and he is fasting, is it better for him not to fast, or should he continue fasting?","The majority of scholars view that fasting whilst traveling is permissible. If the traveler fasts, it counts and he does not have to make it up. For more, please see the detailed answer","Fasting while traveling: Permissible?


Fasting or not fasting while traveling: Which is better?","Praise be to Allah.Fasting while traveling: Permissible?
The four Imams and the majority of the Sahabah and Tabi’in were of the view that fasting whilst traveling is permissible and is correct and valid. If the traveler fasts, it counts and he does not have to make it up. (Al-Mawsu’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, vol. 28, p. 73) 
Fasting or not fasting while traveling: Which is better?
As to what is better, that depends: 
1- If fasting and not fasting are the same, in the sense that fasting does not affect him, then in this case fasting is better, because of the following evidence: 

Abu’l-Darda’ (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “We went out with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) [on a journey] during the month of Ramadan when it was intensely hot, until one of us would put his hand on his head because of the intense heat, and no one among us was fasting apart from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and ‘Abd-Allah ibn Rawahah.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1945; Muslim, no. 1122)
Fasting while traveling means that one fulfills one's duty more quickly, because making it up later means delaying it, but fasting in Ramadan means doing it sooner.
It is usually easier for the one who has this duty, because fasting and breaking the fast with the people is easier than starting to fast all over again.
It makes the most of a blessed time, namely Ramadan, for Ramadan is better than other times, because it is the time when fasting is obligatory. Based on this evidence the view of al-Shafi`i, which is that fasting is better in the case of one for whom fasting and not fasting are the same, is most likely to be correct.

2- If not fasting is easier for him, then in this case we say that not fasting (when traveling ) is better. If something will give him hardship, then in his case fasting becomes makruh, because doing something that causes hardship when there is a concession indicates that one is spurning a concession granted by Allah. 
3- If it causes unbearable difficulty, then in this case it becomes haram for him to fast. The evidence for that is the report narrated by Muslim from Jabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah (may Allah be pleased with them), that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went out to Makkah in the year of the Conquest in Ramadan, and fasted until he reached Kura’ al-Ghamim. The people were fasting, but he called for a cup of water and lifted it up so that the people could see it, then he drank it. After that, he was told that some of the people had continued to fast. He said, “Those are the disobedient, those are the disobedient.” According to another report, he was told, “The people are finding it hard to fast, and they are waiting to see what you will do.” So he called for a cup of water after ‘Asr. (1114) So he described those who fasted even though it was very difficult as being disobedient. (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’ by Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him), vol. 6, p. 355). 
Al-Nawawi and al-Kamal ibn al-Humam said: 
“The ahadith which indicate that it is better not to fast are to be interpreted as referring to those who will be harmed by fasting; in some of them this is clearly stated, so they must be interpreted in this manner, so as to reconcile between the ahadith. That is better than neglecting some of them or claiming that they have been abrogated, without definitive evidence to that effect.  In the case of those for whom fasting and not fasting are the same, they quoted as evidence the hadith of ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her), that Hamzah ibn ‘Amr al-Aslami (may Allah be pleased with him) said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Should I fast whilst traveling ?” – and he used to fast a lot. He (the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)) said: “if you want to, then fast; if you don’t want to, then do not fast.” (Agreed upon)

Now we both feel like we did something wrong against God's commandments. What can we do about our remorse?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Undoubtedly you made a great mistake by doing that.

See question no. 11885. 
Whatever the case, you have to consult experts in the field to find out whether it is possible for you to reverse the operation and put things back to the way they were. If that is not possible, then you have to repent and seek forgiveness, and do not despair of the mercy of Allaah. 
You should note that the son of Adam commits sin, and the best of those who commit sin are those who repent. 
It was narrated from Anas that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Every son of Adam commits sin, and the best of those who commit sin are those who repent.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2499; Ibn Maajah, 4251; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 4515. 
Indeed, Allaah rejoices over the repentance of His slave and He is the One Who enables him to do that, although He has no need of His creation. 
It was narrated that al-Nu’maan ibn Basheer said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Indeed, Allaah rejoices over the repentance of His slave more than a man who loads his provision of food and drink on a camel, then he travels until he is in a wilderness, then the time  for the siesta comes, so he dismounts and takes a nap under a tree, but he falls into a deep sleep and his camel gets away, then he wakes up and he climbs one hill but he sees nothing, then he climbs another hill but he sees nothing, then he climbs a third hill but he sees nothing. Then he goes back to the place where he took his nap and whilst he is sitting there, his camel comes walking towards him until it puts its reins in his hand. But   indeed Allaah rejoices more greatly than this man when he finds his camel.” Narrated by Muslim, 2745. 
And you should always be keen to recite “Sayyid al-Istighfaar” (the best of prayers for forgiveness), which was narrated by Shaddaad ibn Aws (may Allaah be pleased with him) from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): 
“The best of prayers for forgiveness is: Allaahumma anta rabbiy laa ilaaha illa anta, khalaqtani wa ana ‘abduka wa ana ‘ala ‘ahdika wa wa’dika ma astata’tu. A’oodhu bika min sharri ma sana’tu, aboo’u laka bi ni’matika ‘alayya wa aboo’u laka bi dhanbi, faghfir li fa innahu laa yaghfir al-dhunooba illa anta (O Allaah, You are my Lord, there is no god but You. You have created me and I am Your slave and I am keeping my promise and covenant to You as much as I can. I seek refuge with You from the evil of what I do. I acknowledge Your blessing and I acknowledge my sin, so forgive me, for there is none who can forgive sin except You).” He said: “Whoever says this during the day, believing in it firmly, and dies on that day before evening comes, he will be one of the people of Paradise, and whoever says it at night, believing firmly in it, and dies before morning comes, he will be one of the people of Paradise.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5947. 
You should choose the best of times to pray for forgiveness, which is the last third of the night. Allaah says, praising His believing slaves (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and those who pray and beg Allaah’s Pardon in the last hours of the night” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:17]
It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allaah (S) said: “Our Lord descends to the lowest heaven each night during the last third of the night, and He says: ‘Who will call upon Me, that I may answer him, who will ask of Me, that I may give him, who will ask My forgiveness, that I may forgive him?’”  Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1094; Muslim, 758.

And Allaah knows best.",Islam Q&A
20172,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20172,He is asking: are all the pious shaykhs Salafis?,"I am confused about the Islamic groups that exist.  I believe that the Salafees and the Ahlul Hadeeth are the closest to the Sunnah.  

Are all the Pious Scholars Salafees? .",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Yes, the closest of the groups that exist nowadays to the 
    Sunnah are the Salafis, because their principles are based on the idea of 
    referring all matters of religion, theoretical and practical, to the Book of 
    Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him), and the consensus of the earliest generations (salaf) of this 
    ummah, the first three generations: the generation of the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), then those who followed them, 
    then those who followed them; as well as venerating the Sunnah of the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the way of the 
    Rightly-Guided Caliphs; loving those who follow the Sunnah, avoiding bid’ah 
    and innovations in the religion of Allaah, both theoretical and practical, 
    and condemning those who follow them; striving to cleanse people’s thoughts 
    and actions of these innovations and to bring them back to the way of life 
    of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his 
    companions, following his guidance and the true religion. 

    But… this does not mean that all the pious shaykhs are 
    Salafis or that all the Salafis are pious and that others are not pious. No, 
    this is not the case. 

    Piety (taqwa) means doing that which Allaah and His Messenger 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) have enjoined and forsaking 
    that which Allaah and His Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) have forbidden. Everyone who obeys Allaah and avoids disobeying 
    Him is following light from Allaah and is pious. Everyone who disobeys 
    Allaah is falling short in piety to the extent of his disobedience or sin. 

    If this is what piety means, then it cannot be attained 
    simply by calling oneself a Salafi or anything else, or joining any of the 
    groups. Rather the more one attains of the causes of piety – such as 
    learning about Allaah and His laws and acting upon them – the greater share 
    one will have of piety and the higher his status will be in Islam. 

    Because of that, we have to differentiate between the Salafi 
    manhaj (way or methodology) which is protected from error as it is based on 
    the sources of sharee’ah, namely the Qur’aan, Sunnah and scholarly 
    consensus, and the individuals who claim to belong to this path. These 
    individuals are not free of error with regard to their knowledge or actions, 
    whether that error is a sin or even a bid’ah (innovation). Rather the person 
    who does it is to blame for it; it is not permissible to blame the manhaj 
    for this mistake. That leads to vilification of the Salafi manhaj on the 
    grounds that So and so (a Salafi) made a mistake and did such and such. 

    There follow some examples which will explain that: 

    Islam is undoubtedly the religion of Allaah, and He will not 
    accept any other. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will 
    never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers”

    [Aal ‘Imraan 3:85] 

    “Truly, the religion with Allaah is Islam”

    [Aal ‘Imraan 3:19].

     This does not mean that the Muslims are infallible or that 
    everything the Muslims do is correct. Indeed many Muslims – unfortunately – 
    have gone against Islam and disobeyed the Sovereign, the All Knowing. Just 
    as it is essential to differentiate between Islam and what the Muslims do, 
    it is also essential to differentiate between the Salafi manhaj (way) and 
    the Salafis.

We recommend to you some remedies and du`as that are prescribed in shari’ah. Remedies include the following: 

Honey. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“Then, eat of all fruits, and follow the ways of your Lord made easy (for you).” There comes forth from their bellies a drink of varying colour wherein is healing for men. Verily, in this is indeed a sign for people who think.” [al-Nahl 16:69]

Indian aloes wood (al-‘ud al-hindi). 

It was narrated that Umm Qays bint Muhsin said: I heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “You should use Indian aloes wood for in it are seven cures.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5368; Muslim, 287)

Cupping 

It was narrated from Ibn 'Abbas that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was treated with cupping when he was in a state of ihram on his head for a migraine that he was suffering from. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5374; Muslim, 1202)
Al-Bukhari included it in a chapter which he called: Chapter on cupping for migraines and headaches. 

Black seed 

It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “In the black seed is healing for every disease except death.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5364; Muslim, 2215)
Du`a for pain in body
With regard to the du`as which we recommend to you, we will mention some du`as from the sahih Sunnah: 

It was narrated from ‘Uthman ibn Abi’l-‘As that he complained to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about a pain in his body that he had suffered from the time he became Muslim. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him: “Put your hand on the part of the body that hurts and say Bismillah (in the name of Allah) three times. And say seven times: A’udhu Billahi wa qudratihi min sharri ma ajidu wa uhadhir (I seek refuge in Allah and His power from the evil of what I feel and worry about).” (Narrated by Muslim, 2202)


It was narrated from ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that when the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came to a sick person or a sick person was brought to him, he would say: “Adhhib al-ba’s Rabb an-nas, wa’shfi anta al-Shafi, la shifa a illa shifauka shifa an la yughadiru saqaman (Take away the pain, O Lord of mankind, and grant healing, for You are the Healer, and there is no healing but Your healing that leaves no trace of sickness).” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5351, Muslim, 2191)

You should also recite al-Fatihah and al-Mu`awwidhat, and in the whole Quran there is healing, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And We send down of the Quran that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe (in Islamic Monotheism and act on it), and it increases the Zalimun (polytheists and wrongdoers) nothing but loss.” [al-Isra 17:82]
        3.  It was narrated from Abu Sa’id al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) that some of the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came to one of the Arab tribes. They asked them for hospitality but they refused to welcome them. Whilst they were like that, the chief of that tribe was stung. They said: ‘Do you have any remedy or someone who can recite ruqyah?’ They said: ‘You did not offer us hospitality, so we will not do anything until you give us something in return.’ Then they agreed upon a flock of sheep. Then he started to recite the Essence of the Quran – i.e., Surat al-Fatihah – and he collected his saliva and spat at him (at the site of the injury), and he recovered. The sheep were brought and they (the Companions) said: We will not take them until we ask the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). So they asked him and he smiled and said: “How did you know that it is a ruqyah? Take them and give me a share of them.”  (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5404; Muslim, 2201)

It was narrated from ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to recite al-mu`awwidhat and blow over himself during his final illness, and when he became too ill (to do that), I used to recite them and blow over him and wipe his hand on him for blessing. 

Mu`ammar said: I asked al-Zuhri how he used to blow and he said: He used to blow on his hands then wipe his face with them. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5403; Muslim, 2192)

20177,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20177,How Was the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) Bewitched?,"How was the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) bewitched, when Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):

“Allah will protect you from mankind,” [5:67]?

How could he have been bewitched when he was receiving revelation from His Lord and conveying that to the Muslims? How could he convey it if he was bewitched, and the kafirs (non-Muslims) and mushrikeen (pagans) said:

“You follow none but a man bewitched,” [25:8 – interpretation of the meaning]

We hope that you could explain this and clear up these doubts.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    It was proven in a 
    saheeh hadeeth (authentic narration) that this witchcraft took place in 
    Madeenah, when the revelation and the message had become well-established 
    and clear, and after the evidence of Prophethood and the truthfulness of the 
    message had been confirmed, and after Allah had supported His Prophet (peace 
    and blessings of Allah be upon him) against the mushrikeen and humiliated 
    them. Then a Jewish person called Labeed ibn al-A’asam came to him and did 
    some kind of witchcraft against him, using a comb and the hairs stuck to it 
    and the skin of pollen of a male date palm. He – the Prophet (peace and 
    blessings of Allah be upon him) – started to imagine that he had done 
    something with his wife when he had not done it, but his reason, feelings 
    and ability to distinguish matters remained with him with regard to the 
    things he was telling the people, praise be to Allah. So he continued to 
    speak to the people of the truth which Allah had revealed to Him. But he 
    felt that something was affecting him with regard to his wives, as ‘Aishah 
    (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “He used to imagine that he had done 
    something in the house with his wife when he had not done it. So revelation 
    came to him from his Lord via Jibreel (peace be upon him), telling him what 
    had happened. So he sent someone to take that thing [the material used for 
    witchcraft purposes] out of the well of one of the Ansar (inhabitants of 
    Madeenah who welcomed emigrants from makkah), and he destroyed it.” Then the 
    effects of that left him, praise be to Allah, and Allah revealed to him the 
    two surahs of seeking refuge with Allah (al-Mu’awwadhatayn, the last two 
    surahs of the Quran). He recited them and all harm left him. The Prophet 
    (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Those who seek refuge can 
    never seek refuge with anything like them.” Nothing resulted from this 
    witchcraft that could have harmed the people or undermined the message or 
    revelation. Allah protected him from the people with regard to the matter of 
    receiving and conveying the message. 

    But with regard to 
    the kinds of harm that befell the Messengers, he (peace and blessings of 
    Allah be upon him) was not protected from them, rather some such things 
    befell him too. He was wounded on the day of Uhud, and his helmet was 
    smashed on his head and his cheek was cut, some of the rings from his chain 
    mail pierced his cheeks, he fell in one of the holes that were there, and 
    they subjected him to intense persecution in Makkah. He suffered some of the 
    things that the Messengers before him had suffered, and that were decreed 
    for him, by means of which Allah raised him in status and multiplied his 
    hasanat (reward for good deeds). But Allah protected him from them, so that 
    they were not able to kill him or to prevent him from conveying the Message; 
    they were not able to prevent him from fulfilling his obligation to convey 
    the message, so he conveyed it and fulfilled the mission with which he had 
    been entrusted. May the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, and praise 
    be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.

Al-Nawawi said: 
“For the sake of Allah” excludes one whom he kills as a hadd punishment or by way of legal retaliation (qisas), because whoever is killed by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) on the battlefield was intending to kill the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
It is not known that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) killed anyone among the mushrikeen with his own hand apart from Ubayy ibn Khalaf. 
That was narrated by Ibn Jarir and al-Hakim from Sa’id ibn al-Musayyab and al-Zuhri (may Allah have mercy on them). Ibn Kathir said in his Tafsir (2/296): its isnad is sahih. 
Ibn al-Qayyim said – when discussing the battle of Uhud –  
“The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) turned towards the Muslims, and the first one who recognized him beneath his armour was Ka’b ibn Malik, who shouted at the top of his voice, “O Muslims! Rejoice! This is the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)!” He gestured to him to be quiet, and the Muslims gathered around him and went with him to the mountain pass where he had camped. Among them were Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, ‘Ali, al-Harith ibn al-Simmah al-Ansari and others. When they got close to the mountain, Ubayy ibn Khalaf, who was on a horse of his whose name was al-‘Iwadh, caught up with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
The enemy of Allah had claimed that he would kill the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) whilst riding this horse. When he got close to him, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) took a spear from al-Harith ibn al-Simmah and killed him with it. It hit him in his collarbone and the enemy of Allah retreated in defeat. The mushrikin said to him, By Allah, there is nothing wrong with you. He said, By Allah, if what is wrong with me had happened to the family of Dhu’l-Majaz, they would all have died. He used to feed his horse in Makkah and say, I will kill Muhammad riding it.
News of that reached the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and he said: “Rather I will kill him, in sha Allah.” When he stabbed him, the enemy of Allah remembered that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had said, “Rather I will kill him,” and he was certain that he would die from this wound. And he died from it in Sarif on his way back to Makkah.” (Zad al-Ma’ad, 3/199)

First he wanted to get he acceptance of my mother and so. But suddenly a change came and now he doesnt care at all he is changed, his attitiude is quiet rude. My mother still is good with my brother but his attitude is bad. He is bad with my father. And I think there is a chance that the girl might have done some Amal(magic) on my family and my brother.

So is there a way we can know about wether there is some black magic done on my brother or not. As my father doesnt believe in Magic its hard for my father to find out a Aalim or a Mufti and get the issue solved. Also please make duaa for his good. He is not keeping in touch with me , the girl he loves is not liked by our whole family,and my brother before used to say that its not right to marry a girl without parents acceptance.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    I advise your father and the father of this woman not to 
    prevent this marriage, so long as there is no shar’i reason to prevent it. 
    If your brother loves this woman and she loves him, then it is in their 
    interests to get married. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “There is nothing better for two people who are in love than 
    marriage,” i.e., if a man loves a woman and she loves him, then let them get 
    married, and that will calm them down and protect them from doing anything 
    haraam. Isn’t their getting married better for him, for her and for their 
    families than their falling into something that Allaah has forbidden? The 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, addressing 
    the guardians of women, if a man comes to propose marriage: “If there comes 
    to you one with whose religious commitment and character you are pleased, 
    then marry (your daughter) to him; if you do not do that then there will be 
    fitnah (tribulation) and widespread corruption on earth.” 

    But if there is a shar’i reason to prevent that, then our 
    advice to your brother is to obey his father and to remain chaste, and to 
    strive hard in doing so. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “Whoever strives to be chaste, Allaah will help him to be 
    chaste,” i.e., whoever does his utmost to be chaste, Allaah will grant him 
    chastity and help him. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “As for those who strive hard in Us (Our Cause), We will 
    surely guide them to Our paths (i.e. Allaah’s religion — Islamic 
    Monotheism)” [al-‘Ankaboot 29:69]
And he should look for 
    another wife who will help him with his religious commitment and his worldly 
    interests. 

    With regard to witchcraft, if a person regularly reads 
    Qur’aan and recites the adhkaar that the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) used to recite when going to sleep, when waking up, 
    in the morning and the evening and at other times and in other 
    circumstances, then he will protect himself thereby from the accursed 
    Shaytaan. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “Allaah enjoined five things upon Yahya ibn Zakariyya, which he was to 
    follow and to enjoin upon the Children of Israel…” then he mentioned them, 
    among which was: “and He commands you to remember Him. The likeness of that 
    is of a man who is being pursued by his enemy, until he comes to a strong 
    fortress where he protects himself from them. Similarly a person cannot 
    protect himself against the Shaytaan with anything better than the 
    remembrance of Allaah (dhikr).” 

    Al-Mi’wadhaat (soorahs seeking protection with Allaah) are 
    among the greatest things by means of which a person may protect himself 
    against witchcraft, so recite them in the morning and in the evening, after 
    every prayer and before going to sleep.

    him and grant him wisdom. And Allaah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
20191,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20191,How to seek knowledge,What does one need to become a scholar of Islam?,,,"Praise be to Allah.You have asked about a serious matter, but it is easy for the one whom Allah enables to do it. Knowledge is a sign of guidance. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If Allah wants to do good to a person, He gives him understanding of the religion.” This is understood to mean that whoever Allah does not wish good for, He does not give him understanding of the religion. 
Al-Bukhaari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Chapter: it is essential to know a thing first before saying or acting upon it, according to the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):  
‘So know (O Muhammad) that Laa ilaaha ill-Allah (none has the right to be worshipped but Allah),’ [Muhammad 47:19] 
So one should start with knowledge. The scholars are the heirs of the Prophets, i.e., they inherit knowledge. Whoever gains knowledge has gained great good fortune, and whoever follows a path to seek knowledge, Allah will make easy for him the path to Paradise. Allah said (interpretation of the meaning): 
‘It is only those who have knowledge among His slaves that fear Allah’ [Faatir 35:28] 
And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
‘but none will understand them except those who have knowledge’ [al-‘Ankaboot 29:43] 
‘And they will say: “Had we but listened or used our intelligence, we would not have been among the dwellers of the blazing Fire!”’ [al-Mulk 67:10] 
And He said: 
‘Are those who know equal to those who know not?’ [al-Zumar 39:9] 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Knowledge is gained by striving for it.” 
Ibn ‘Abbaas said: ‘Be faithful slaves to your Lord, patient and learned.’ And it is said that the good instructor is the one who starts teaching people simple matters of knowledge before more difficult ones.” 
It was narrated that Qays ibn Katheer said: “A man came from Madeenah to Abu’l-Darda’ in Damascus and he said, ‘What brought you here, my brother?’ He said, ‘A hadith which I have heard that you narrate from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).’ He said, ‘Have you come for any other reason?’ He said, ‘No.’ He said, ‘Have you come for trade?’ He said, ‘No. I have only come to seek this hadith.’ He said, ‘I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say, “Whoever follows a path to seek knowledge, Allah will make easy for him the path to Paradise. The angels beat their wings in approval of the seeker of knowledge, and those who are in the heavens and on earth pray for forgiveness for the scholar, even the fish in the water. The superiority of the scholar over the worshipper is like the superiority of the moon over all other heavenly bodies. The scholars are the heirs of the Prophets, for the Prophets did not leave behind dinars or dirhams, rather they left behind knowledge, so whoever gains knowledge has gained great good fortune.’” (narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2606; classed as saheeh by al-Albani). 
These are some of the virtues of knowledge, and this is just a drop in the ocean. If we were to mention all the virtues of knowledge, it would take too long. Perhaps what we have mentioned here will serve as a reminder to the one who has a heart or gives ear whilst he is heedful (cf. Qaaf 50:37). See Question no.  10471. 
With regard to the way to gain knowledge, it is to fear Allah (taqwa) and to be aware that He is always watching, in secret and in the open. Then one should learn from the scholars whose knowledge and religious commitment can be trusted. If you find a scholar who meets this description, then cling to him and consult him in order to gain knowledge. If you cannot find a scholar, then look for a seeker of knowledge (taalib ‘ilm), and if you cannot find such a person, then you must study by using tapes and books that deal with the basic issues of Islam according to the correct methodology of sharee’ah. 
If you ask, what are the books that we should study? 
The answer is:  
First of all you should take a gradual approach to acquiring Islamic knowledge. For each branch of knowledge there are specific books. The first thing you should study should be ‘aqeedah (basic tenets of faith, doctrine), then the sciences which will help you to understand the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), such as Arabic grammar, usool al-fiqh, mustalah al-hadith, then fiqh and Tafseer… before all of that you should start by memorizing Qur’aan, because all other branches of knowledge are studied to help one to reach a correct understanding of the Qur’aan. 
Here we will give you a list of books, organized in order of priority. 
On ‘Aqeedah: start with the book al-Usool al-Thalaathah [available in English as “The Three Fundamental Bases of Islamic Theology”], then Kitaab al-Tawheed [available in English as “Kitab al-Tauhid”], then Kashf al-Shubuhaat, all by Shaykh Muahmmad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab. Then read Kitaab al-‘Aqeedah al-Waasitiyyah [also available in English as “Principles of Islamic Faith”] by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah. 
After studying and understanding these books, move on to Kitaab al-Ajrumiyyah, on Arabic grammar, then Kitaab al-Usool fi ‘Ilm al-Usool, on usool al-fiqh, then Kitaab Usool al-Tafseer – both by Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen, may Allah have mercy on him. Then study al-Arba’een al-Nawawiyyah [al-Nawawi’s 40 Hadith, available in English in several translations] on hadith, then ‘Umdat al-Ahkaam, also on hadith. Then start studying fiqh, and it is OK to study the fiqh texts of any of the recognized schools of thought, such as Bidaayat al-Saalikeen, ‘Umdat al-Fiqh, Matan Abi Shujaa’, and Matan Khaleel. We do not want you to be biased towards any of the madhhabs, rather your study should be organized and based on the well-established principles, so that your pursuit of knowledge will be enhanced and you will follow the evidence, not be biased towards any particular madhhab.  
It should be noted that the books mentioned above are to be studied so that you memorize and understand them. Try to get hold of tapes of the scholars who have commented on these books, such as Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz, Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen, Shaykh ‘Abd-Allah ibn Jibreen, and others. 
After studying fiqh, read two books on Tafseer. Start with Tayseer al-Kareem al-Rahmaan fi tafseer kalaam al-Mannaan by Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Sa’di (may Allah have mercy on him), and Tafseer Ibn Katheer [an abridged version in 10 volumes is available in English]. 
These are the most important books which the seeker of knowledge should study. When you have finished them, there are more advanced books which we will tell you about when you have finished these books. Keep in touch with us.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
20193,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20193,Intention and du`a during prayer,"My question is on the intention during regular prayer. What should one be thinking during his prayer, the glorification of Allah? The reason I ask is that for some reason I remember reading a hadith that says you should always be asking from Allah during your prayer. Is this true, and if it is how does one go about doing that, by thought or by saying something during the prayer? May allah be pleased with what you are doing.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The intention is a condition of prayer, which is essential for the prayer to be valid. The shar’i definition of the intention is: “Deciding to do an act of worship in order to draw closer to Allah.” This definition includes two meanings: 
1 – The intention to do the action. This distinguishes acts of worship from other actions, and distinguishes acts of worship from one another. So one has the intention that these movements are the prescribed prayer, and  decides whether it is fard (obligatory) or naafil. 
2 – The intention with regard to whom it is done for. This means that by doing this action one is seeking the pleasure of Allah and nothing else. 
The site of this intention is the heart. By simply deciding in his heart to do this action, a person has made his intention. Hence it is not prescribed to speak the intention out loud when one wants to do the action. Rather speaking the intention out loud is a kind of innovation that was not narrated in the Book of Allah or in the Sunnah of His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), nor was it narrated from any of his Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them all). See al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 2/283. For more information please see question no. 13337. 
With regard to what a person should think about during the prayer, he should focus on the greatness of his Lord before Whom he is honoured to stand. So he should stand before Him properly, with humility and veneration. He should think about what it is prescribed for him to say in every part of the prayer. When he is standing he should ponder the meaning of what he is reciting from the Quran. When bowing he should think about the meaning of the dhikr he is reciting, and the same when prostrating and in other parts of the prayer. He should also strive in all parts of the prayer to recite the dhikrs and du`as that were narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). With regard to du`a in the sense of asking Allah for what one needs of the good things in this world and in the Hereafter, the time to do that is when prostrating, after reciting the prescribed dhikr, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I have been forbidden to recite Quran when bowing and prostrating. As for rukoo’ (bowing), glorify your Lord therein, and as for sujood (prostration), strive in du`a, for then it is more likely that your Lord will answer you.” (Narrated by Muslim, 738). 
With regard to what is mentioned in the question, that it is narrated in some ahaadeeth that we have to call upon Allah throughout the prayer, none of the reputable scholars has mentioned this or referred to it. Perhaps you have understood from the definition of some scholars that salah (prayer) means du`a (supplication), and this is the meaning that you mentioned. 
Or perhaps you have heard some scholars saying that salah is all du`a. By this they were referring to the second category of du`a, for some of the scholars divided du`a into two categories: 
1 – du`a in the sense of asking, which means asking Allah for one’s needs; and 2 – du`a in the sense of worship, which means worshipping Allah in the ways that He has prescribed, by means of various acts of worship such as prayer, fasting and zakaah. What this means is that these acts of worship include asking from Allah, is if one is saying, “O Allah accept this from me” or “Reward me for this act of worship by granting me forgiveness, admission to Paradise and salvation from Hell,” etc. All of prayer is considered to be du`a in this sense. 
Hence our advice to all Muslims is to adhere to the Sunnah of the greatest of Messengers (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) throughout the prayer, following his command: “pray as you have seen me praying.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 631). They should ponder the meanings of what they recite from the Quran, and the dhikrs they recite, so that they may fulfil the greater purpose of prayer which is, as Allah explained: 
“and perform As-salah (Iqaamat-as-salah). Verily, As-salah (the prayer) prevents from Al-Fahshaa’ (i.e. great sins of every kind, unlawful sexual intercourse) and Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism, and every kind of evil wicked deed)”
[al-‘Ankaboot 29:45 – interpretation of the meaning]

I am now a close student to the teacher which means he teaches me more of the style and chinese medicine. In my position I must help the school grow by trying to get more people at the school. My intention is to get the people in the school so they can learn self defense. The problem is that in this school there are two types of (major)shirk that go on regularly, but the teacher does not force the student to perform these things if he doesn't want to. Is it haram that I bring people to the school knowing they might engage in these activities. What about children?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Practising sports of various kinds that do not go against the rulings of sharee’ah and that fulfil the aim of worshipping Allah is one of the things that are encouraged by Islam, so as to attain physical strength and mental health. The evidence of the Quran and Sunnah indicates that this is allowed in sharee’ah and is in fact encouraged. 
But in some cases these sports may be haram, not in and of themselves, but because they include some haram things. This applies to what you have mentioned in your question. 
An example of the haram things that may happen is bowing to someone other than Allah. It was narrated that Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “A man said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, when one of us meets his friend, can he bow to him?’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ‘No.’ He said, ‘Can he hug him and kiss him?’ He said, ‘No.’ He said, ‘Can he shake hands with him?’ He said, ‘Yes, if he wishes.’” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2728; he said it is a hasan hadith. Also narrated by Ibn Maajah. 3702. The hadith was classed as hasan by al-Albani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 160). 
Ibn Taymiyah said: “With regard to bowing in greeting, this is forbidden as narrated in al-Tirmidhi from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), that they asked him about a man who meets his brother and bows to him, and he said no to that. That is because it is not permitted to bow or prostrate for anyone except Allah.” (Majmoo’ al-Fatawa, 1/377). 
If you know that the person whom you invite to join will do something haram or something that is a kind of shirk, then you should not do that, whether the one whom you invite is a child or an adult, because that is a kind of cooperating in sin, and Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Help you one another in Al‑Birr and At‑Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression” [al-Maa'idah 5:2]
May Allah help us and you to do that which He loves and which pleases Him. May Allah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.",Islam Q&A
20199,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20199,When should a child be stopped from passing in front of a person who is praying?,"From what age do we have to prevent a baby/small child from passing between us and our sutrah,further if despite our efforts to stop them they still pass has our salaah been broken?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The Muslim should strive to have a sutrah (screen) in front 
    of him when he prays, whether he is leading the prayers or praying alone. He 
    should also try not to let anyone or anything pass in front of him, because 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When any 
    one of you prays facing an object that he is using to screen him from the 
    people, and someone wants to pass in front of him, let him push him away, 
    and if he insists let him fight him, for he is no more than a devil.” 
    (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, al-Salaah, 509; Muslim, al-Salaah, 
    505). 
With regard to young 
    children, they should also be prevented from passing, because of the general 
    meaning of the evidence and because it was narrated from ‘Amr ibn Shu’ayb 
    from his father that his grandfather said: “We stopped with the Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in Thaniyat 
    Adhaakhir and the time for prayer came, so we prayed facing a wall. The 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) faced the wall and 
    we were behind him. An animal came and wanted to pass in front of him, and 
    he kept pushing it back until his stomach touched the wall, then it passed 
    behind him.” (Narrated by Abu Dawood, 807; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani). 
    This indicates that stopping others from passing in front is not restricted 
    only to stopping adults or those of sound mind. 

    But if the worshipper tries his hardest to stop the one who 
    wants to pass in front of him and is unable to stop him, what is the ruling 
    in this case? 

    Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    said: 

    “The sin is on the one who passes in front of him. If you did 
    what the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded 
    but were unable to stop the one who wanted to pass in front of you, then 
    your prayer is not affected.”
