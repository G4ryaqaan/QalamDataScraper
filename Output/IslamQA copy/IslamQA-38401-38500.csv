38468,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/38468,Holding more than one Eid prayer in one city,The Muslim organization has rented a large hall to hold the Eid prayers. Is it permissible for a group that is approximately thirty miles away from the hall to organize Eid prayers in their own mosque? Please note that means of transportation are available. Is it better to bring together most of the Muslims in the hall to offer the Eid prayers instead of having more than one jamaa’ah?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.If you can join together, that is preferable, but if that will be too difficult for you, there is nothing wrong with them praying in their own city that is thirty miles away from the place where the Eid prayers are being held, which makes it difficult for them to join together. 
And Allaah is the Source of strength.","Standing Committee for Academic Research and Issuing Fatwas, 8/292"
