9602,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9602,How to Please Your Husband in Islam,"My husband and I have been married for nearly 6 months. We are having re-occuring problems regarding how much sex we have. My husband has strong needs in this area, which he has told me about many times. 

I have tried hard to meet his needs, but find myself unable to keep up with him for more than a week or so. I become very tired, and feel physically unable to do this.
My husband now finds the situation hard to deal with, and often separates from me - within the home. I understand that it is my obligation to respond to his needs, but what are our rights to each other in the case that one finds it hard to keep up with the other, even though their intention is to please them. Is my husband allowed to separate from me in this way?
Also is he allowed to come to me for such relations when we have had an argument and have not been speaking to each other?
We are, alhumdulillah, very happy together otherwise and love and respect each other very much, and would like to find an Islamic resolution to remove this problem from our marriage.","1- It is obligatory for the wife to please her husband if he calls her to his bed. If she refuses she is sinning.

Can a wife refuse her husband’s bed?","Praise be to Allah.Husband and wife relationship in bed
The husband is obliged to treat his wife in a kind and reasonable manner. Part of that kind and reasonable treatment is intercourse, which he has to do. The majority of scholars set the time limit beyond which it is not permissible for the husband to forgo intercourse at four months, but the correct view is that there is no time limit; the husband should have intercourse with his wife according to what satisfies her.  
Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Intercourse is obligatory upon the man if he has no excuse. This was also the view of Malik.” (Al-Mughni, 7/30) 
Al-Jassas said: 
“He (the husband) is obliged to have intercourse with her, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“…so as to leave the other hanging (i.e. neither divorced or married)…” [al-Nisa 4:129]
meaning, neither divorcing her so that she can marry another nor leaving her without a husband because he is not fulfilling his duty of having intercourse with her.” (Ahkam al-Quran, 1/374 
Shaykh al-Islam (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“It is obligatory upon the husband to have intercourse with his wife according to what will satisfy her, so long as this will not harm him physically, or keep him from earning a living, and that is not restricted to four months.” (Al-Ikhtiyarat al-Fiqhiyyah, p. 246)
Can a wife refuse her husband’s bed?
It is obligatory for the wife to obey her husband if he calls her to his bed. If she refuses she is sinning. 
Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If a man calls his wife to his bed, and she refuses to come, the angels curse her until morning comes.”  (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3065; Muslim, 1436)
Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah] said: 
“She must obey him if he asks her to come to his bed, and that is obligatory upon her. If she refuses to come to his bed, she is a defiant sinner… as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“As to those women on whose part you see ill-conduct, admonish them (first), (next) refuse to share their beds, (and last) beat them (lightly without causing pain and injury, if it is useful); but if they return to obedience, seek not against them means (of annoyance)” [al-Nisa 4:34]” (al-Fatawa al-Islamiyyah, 3/145, 146)
It is not permissible for a husband to force his wife to do more than she is able to bear of intercourse. If she has an excuse such as being sick or unable to bear it, then she is not sinning if she refuses to have intercourse.
 Ibn Hazm said: 
“It is obligatory on slave women and free women alike not to refuse their masters or husbands if they call them, so long as the woman who is called is not menstruating or sick in such a way that intercourse will be harmful to her, or observing an obligatory fast. If she refuses with no excuse, then she is cursed.” (Al-Muhalla, 10/40)
Al-Bahuti said: 
“The husband has the right to enjoy intimacy with his wife at any time… so long as he does not distract her from obligatory religious duties or harm her. In that case, he does not have the right to intimacy with her without her permission, because that is contrary to the idea of reasonable and kind treatment. So long as he does not distract her from that and does not harm her, then he has the right to intimacy.” (Kashf al-Qina’, 5/189)
What to do when your husband expects sex all the time
The wife whose husband harms her by having intercourse with her too much can agree with her husband on the number of times that she can bear. If he does more than that to the point that he harms her, she can refer the matter to the qadi (judge), and the qadi can determine the number of times that the husband and wife should stick to. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said:  
“The husband should have intercourse with his wife according to what satisfies her, so long as that does not harm him physically or keep him from earning a living; it is not limited to four months. 
If they argue, then the judge should decide on the number of times, just as the judge should decide on the level of spending on a wife.” (Al-Ikhtiyarat al-Fiqhiyyah, p. 246)
Because there are no Shari’ah courts nowadays in your country, the wife should try to come to an agreement with her husband on this matter, so she should speak to him frankly and remind him of the verses and ahadith that command the husband to be kind to his wife. She should explain to him that she is only refusing because of the harm that is being caused to her, and that she is very keen to obey him and respond to his desires. Our advice to the sister is that she should be patient with her husband and put up with it as much as she can, and she should note that she will be rewarded for that by Allah.
 The husband has to fear Allah with regard to his wife, and not make her do more than she is able to do. He should be kind to his wife and treat her in a reasonable manner. If his desire is so strong that one wife is not enough for him, then why does he not try to look for a solution to this problem that is affecting his relationship with his wife, or which may lead to something even worse, which would be looking to satisfy his desire in haram ways?  
One of the solutions that would help to solve this problem is to take a second wife. Allah has permitted men to marry up to four, on condition that he treat them all fairly. Another solution would be to fast a lot, because fasting reduces desire. And another solution would be to take medicine that will reduce his desire, subject to the condition that this will not cause him any harm. 
And Allah is the One Whom we ask to set the Muslims’ affairs straight.

9603,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9603,Why Do Muslims Pray 5 Times a Day?,"I read in the Quran that a man should pray three times: before sunrise, after sunset and in the middle of the day. So why do we pray five times? I hope that you will not give me the story that 50,000 prayers were enjoined then it was reduced to five. I want a convincing answer.","Why Muslims pray 5 times a day falls into the rules of Shari`ah which are purely worship, the wisdom behind which is concealed from us and is not mentioned in either the Quran or the Sunnah. So we have to submit to the command of Allah.","Categories of the rules of Shari`ah


Understanding the reasons why things have been prescribed","Praise be to Allah.Categories of the rules of Shari`ah

What is mentioned in the question about the number of prayers is mistaken. It was 50 then it was altered to 5 prayers, a favour from the Lord of the Worlds to the Muslims. 
The rules of Shari`ah may be divided into two categories: those which may be understood on a rational basis; and those which are purely worship, the wisdom behind which is concealed from us and is not mentioned in either the Quran or the Sunnah. 

Examples of the first include: the prohibition on alcohol and gambling . Allah has told us the reason why they are forbidden, which is: 
“Shaytan (Satan) wants only to excite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants (alcoholic drinks) and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of Allah and from As-Salah (the prayer). So, will you not then abstain?” [Al-Maidah 5:91]
And there are other similar rulings.  
Examples of the second kind include offering Zuhr prayer when the sun has passed its zenith, circumambulating the Ka’bah with it on one's left (i.e., anticlockwise ), the nisab of gold being a quarter of ten percent; Maghrib prayer being three rak’ahs, and many other such rulings. 
What is mentioned in the question falls into this second category, which is things for which we do not know the reason from the Quran or Sunnah, so we have to submit to the command of Allah. This applies to all such rulings. 
The Muslim has to accept the things for which Allah has not explained the reason, and say as the believers say: “We hear and we obey.” He should not be like the Children of Israel who said: “We hear but we disobey.” 
Accepting what Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “He [Allah] cannot be questioned as to what He does, while they will be questioned” [al-Anbiya 21:23] is better for the believer in his religious and worldly affairs, for he is a slave who has a Lord, and the slave has no right to ask his Lord why He enjoined something. Rather he has to submit to His command. If he tells us why, we should do it, and if He does not tell us why, we should still do it. 

 In al-Mawsu’ah al-Fiqhiyyah al-Kuwaitiyyah (1/49-51) there is a useful discussion which we will quote here: 

Understanding the reasons why things have been prescribed
With regard to understanding the reasons why things have been prescribed, we may divide the issues of fiqh into two categories: 

Rulings whose wisdom may be understood on a rational basis, either because the reason is stated in the texts, or because it is easy to work out. 

Such rulings are the majority of those that Allah has prescribed, such as enjoining prayer, zakah, fasting and Hajj in general, and such as enjoining the mahr (dowry) in marriage, ‘iddah (waiting period) following divorce or widowhood, spending on one’s wife, children and relatives, divorce when married life becomes unbearable, and many other such issues of fiqh. 

Rulings which are enjoined on us as a kind of pure worship. These are rulings in which the connection between the ruling and the action is not clear, such as the number of prayers, the number of rak’ahs and most of the actions of Hajj. By the mercy of Allah, such rulings are few in relation to the rulings the wisdom behind which may be rationally understood. These rulings are prescribed as a test to demonstrate whether a person is a true believer. It should also be noted that Shari`ah – both general principles and minor details – does not prescribe anything that contradicts common sense, but it may prescribe something the reason for which cannot be understood. There is a big difference between the two. If a person is rationally convinced that Allah exists and that He is wise, and that He Alone deserves to be acknowledged as Lord, and he is rationally convinced that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is a true prophet, then he affirms that Allah is the Sovereign and the Lord, and that he is His slave. Then if he is commanded to do something or is forbidden to do something, and he then says, “I will not follow this ruling until I know the reason behind this command or prohibition,” then he has proven himself to be false in his claim to be a believer in Allah and His Messenger. The human mind has a limit beyond which it cannot go. 

The one who rebels against the rulings of Allah that have to do with rituals is like a sick person who goes to a trustworthy doctor who prescribes various kinds of medicine for him, some to be taken before eating, some to be taken during the meal and some to be taken afterwards, in various amounts, and he says to the doctor: I will not take your medicine until you explain to me the reason why this one should be taken before eating and this one afterwards, and this one during the meal, and why are they are varying amounts, some small and some big? Does this patient really trust his doctor? The same may be said of a person who claims to believe in Allah and His Messenger, then he rebels against the rulings the wisdom behind which he does not understand. The true believer, if he is commanded to something or forbidden to do something, says, “I hear and I obey,” especially when we have explained that there are no rulings that can be rejected on the basis of reason. Not knowing something does not indicate that it is not true. How many rulings are there, the reason for which has been concealed from us in the past, then we discovered that there is great wisdom behind them? The reason why pork is forbidden was unknown to many people, then we found out that it carries germs and disease and other bad things, and Allah wanted to protect the Muslim society against them. The same may be said concerning the command to wash vessels that have been licked by a dog seven times, one of which should be with earth… and other rulings the wisdom behind which may be discovered one day even though it is hidden from us now.

How to distinguish between the true religion and false religions","Praise be to Allah.Are deviant religions and human traditions true or false? 
Every member of a faith tradition believes that his community is following the truth. Every follower of a religion believes that his religion is the best religion and the straightest way. 
Whenever you ask the followers of deviant religions or the followers of man-made traditions about the evidence for their beliefs, they tell you that they found their fathers doing this so they are following in their footsteps, then they tell you stories and reports that have no sound basis and whose texts are not free of faults and discrepancies. 
They rely on inherited books of which it is not known who wrote or said them, or in which language they were originally written, or in which land they originated; rather they are a mixture that has been gathered and written in a book that is venerated, then they were passed down from generation to generation with no proper scientific examination of the source of the text or of the text itself. 
These unknown books and stories and blind imitation do not provide valid proof with regard to religions and beliefs. Are these deviant religions and human traditions true or false? 
It is impossible that they could all be true, because the truth is one; there are not many “truths”. And it is impossible that all these deviant religions and human traditions could have come from Allah and all be true. If they are many, and the truth is one, then which of them is the truth? So there have to be guidelines by which we may recognize the true religion and distinguish it from false religions.
If we find that these guidelines apply to a religion, then we will know that it is the truth. If these guidelines or one of them is absent from a religion, then we will know that it is false. 
How to distinguish between the true religion and false religions
The guidelines by which we distinguish the true religion from false religions: 
·         The religion should have come from Allah, revealed through one of the angels to one of His Messengers , to convey it to His slaves, because the true religion is the religion of Allah, and Allah is the One Who will judge mankind and bring them to account on the Day of Resurrection according to the religion which He revealed to them. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, We have sent the Revelation to you (O Muhammad) as We sent the Revelation to Nuh (Noah) and the Prophets after him; We (also) sent the Revelation to Ibrahim (Abraham), Isma’il (Ishmael), Ishaq (Isac), Ya’qub (Jacob), and Al-Asbat [the offspring of the twelve sons of Ya’qub (Jacob)], ‘Isa (Jesus), Ayyoob (Job), Yunus (Jonah), Harun (aron), and Sulayman (Solomon); and to Dawud (David) We gave the Zabur (Psalms)” [An-Nisa’ 4:163]
And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
 “And We did not send any Messenger before you (O Muhammad) but We revealed to him (saying): La ilaha illa Ana [none has the right to be worshipped but I (Allah)], so worship Me (Alone and none else)” [Al-Anbiya’ 21:25] 
Based on this, any religion which is introduced by some person who attributes it to himself and not to Allah is undoubtedly a false religion . 
·         It should call for the worship of Allah alone, and forbid Shirk (polytheism or the worship of anything other than Allah). It should also forbid the means that lead to that, because promoting Tawhid (belief in the oneness of Allah) is the basis of the call of all the Prophets and Messengers. Every Prophet said to his people: 
“Worship Allah! You have no other Ilah (God) but Him” [Al-A’raf 7:73 – interpretation of the meaning]
Based on this, any religion that includes Shirk and joins others in worship with Him, such as a Prophet, angel or Wali (“saint”) is a false religion, even if its followers attribute it to one of the Prophets. 
·         It should be in accordance with the principles advocated by the Messengers, such as the worship of Allah alone, calling people to His path, and forbidding Shirk, disobedience to parents, unlawful killing and immoral deeds, both hidden and open. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
 “And We did not send any Messenger before you (O Muhammad) but We revealed to him (saying): La ilaha illa Ana [none has the right to be worshipped but I (Allah)], so worship Me (Alone and none else)” [Al-Anbiya’ 21:25] 
“Say (O Muhammad): Come, I will recite what your Lord has prohibited you from: Join not anything in worship with Him; be good and dutiful to your parents; kill not your children because of poverty — We provide sustenance for you and for them. Come not near to Al-Fawahish (shameful sins and illegal sexual intercourse) whether committed openly or secretly; and kill not anyone whom Allah has forbidden, except for a just cause (according to Islamic law). This He has commanded you that you may understand” [Al-An`am 6:151] 
“And ask (O Muhammad) those of Our Messengers whom We sent before you: Did We ever appoint alihah (gods) to be worshipped besides the Most Gracious (Allah)?” [Az-Zukhruf 43:45]
·         It should not be self-contradictory, so it should not issue one command that is contradicted by another, or forbid something then allow something very similar for no reason, or forbid something or allow it for some but not for others. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Do they not then consider the Quran carefully? Had it been from other than Allah, they would surely, have found therein many a contradiction” [An-Nisa’ 4:82]
·         The religion should guarantee to protect people’s religious commitment, honour, wealth, lives and children through the commands, prohibitions and morals that it prescribes, which protect these five holistic principles.
·         The true religion should be a mercy to mankind, freeing them from the wrongs that they do to themselves and to one another, whether those wrongs have to do with violating their rights, giving control of wealth to the few or leaders misleading the masses. Allah says, telling us of the mercy that was contained in the Tawrat which He sent down to Musa (peace be upon him): 
“And when the anger of Musa (Moses) was calmed down, he took up the Tablets; and in their inscription was guidance and mercy for those who fear their Lord” [Al-A`raf 7:154 – interpretation of the meaning]
Allah says, telling us how He sent ‘Isa (peace be upon him):  
“And (We wish) to appoint him as a sign to mankind and a mercy from Us (Allah).” [Maryam 19:21 – interpretation of the meaning]
And Allah says of Salih (peace be upon him): 
“He said: O my people! Tell me, if I have a clear proof from my Lord, and there has come to me a mercy (Prophethood) from Him.” [Hood 11:63 – interpretation of the meaning]
And He says of the Quran: 
“And We send down of the Quran that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe.” [Al-Isra’ 17:82 – interpretation of the meaning]
·         It should include guidance regarding the laws of Allah and should show people what Allah wants, and should tell them where they came from and where they are going. Allah says of the Tawrat: 
“Verily, We did send down the Tawrat (Torah) [to Musa (Moses)], therein was guidance and light.” [Al-Ma'idah 5:44 – interpretation of the meaning]
He says of the Injil: 
“and We gave him the Injil (Gospel), in which was guidance and light.” [Al-Ma’idah 5:46 – interpretation of the meaning]
And He says of the Quran: 
“It is He Who has sent His Messenger (Muhammad) with guidance and the religion of truth (Islam).” [Al-Tawbah 9:33 – interpretation of the meaning].
The true religion is that which contains guidance concerning the laws of Allah and brings security and peace of mind , so that all whispers of the Shaytan are driven away and all questions are answered, and all confusing matters are cleared up. 
·         It should advocate the best attitudes and actions, such as truthfulness, justice, trustworthiness, modesty, chastity and generosity. And it should forbid bad attitudes and actions, such as disobedience to parents, murder, immoral actions, lying, wrongdoing, oppression, miserliness and promiscuity. 
·         It should bring happiness to those who believe. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Ta-Ha. We have not sent down the Quran unto you (O Muhammad) to cause you distress.” [Ta-Ha 20:1-2]
It should be in accordance with the sound natural disposition of man (Al-Fitrah): 
“Allah’s Fitrah (i.e. Allah’s Islamic Monotheism) with which He has created mankind.” [Al-Rum 30:30 – interpretation of the meaning]
It should also be in accordance with sound reason and common sense, because the true religion is the laws of Allah, and sound reason is the creation of Allah , and it is impossible that the law of Allah and the creation of Allah would contradict one another. 
·         It should point towards the truth and warn against falsehood. It should show the way to true guidance and steer people away from misguidance. It should call people to the straight path in which there is no crookedness. Allah tells us that when the jinn heard the Quran, they said to one another: 
“O our people! Verily, we have heard a Book (this Quran) sent down after Musa (Moses), confirming what came before it, it guides to the truth and to the Straight Path (i.e. Islam)”
[Al-Ahqaf 46:30 – interpretation of the meaning]
It does not call them to that which would cause them misery. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Ta-Ha. We have not sent down the Quran unto you (O Muhammad) to cause you distress” [Ta-Ha 20:1-2]
And it does not enjoin them to do anything that would cause their doom. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And do not kill yourselves (nor kill one another). Surely, Allah is Most Merciful to you.” [An-Nisa’ 4:29]
It does not differentiate between its followers on the grounds of race, colour or tribe. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O mankind! We have created you from a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another. Verily, the most honourable of you with Allah is that (believer) who has At-Taqwa [i.e. he is one of the pious]. Verily, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Aware.” [Al-Hujurat 49:13]
The only distinguishing feature for which people may be preferred over others, according to the true religion , is piety or fear of Allah. 
In the light of the guidelines by which we may distinguish between the true religion and false religions, supported by that which is said in the Holy Quran, which indicates that these guidelines apply to all the truthful Messengers who were sent from Allah, we may then discuss different types of religions.
And Allah knows best.","From Kitab al-Islam Usooluhu wa Mabaadi’uhu, by Dr. Muhammad ibn ‘Abd-Allah ibn Salih al-Suhaym"
9611,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9611,Can a husband permit his wife to uncover her face?,"What is the ruling on a husband who allows his wife to go out of the house with make-up on and big earings dangling from her ears, along with her kimaar worn in such a way that it exposes her ears and neck.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The husband has to realize that he is responsible for his wife, sons and daughters. According to the hadeeth of ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with them both), he said, “I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say, Each of you is a shepherd and each of you is responsible for his flock. The ruler is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock.  A man is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock. A woman is the shepherd of her husband’s household and is responsible for her flock. The servant is the shepherd of his master’s wealth and is responsible for his flock. A man is the shepherd of his father’s wealth and is responsible for his flock. Each of you is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock.” 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 893; Muslim, 1829 
So the husband will be accountable before Allaah on the Day of Resurrection for his wife and children if he fell short in advising them and teaching them properly. 
Secondly: 
The scholars have stated that women’s adornments fall into two categories: 
Visible adornment, which is the woman’s outer dress 
And hidden adornment, which no one should see except the husband, such as kohl, bangles and rings. 
The evidence for that is the report narrated from Ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) concerning the interpretation of the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and not to show off their adornment except only that which is apparent”
[al-Noor 24:31]
Ibn Mas’ood said: The adornment is of two types, visible adornment and hidden adornment which no one should see except the husband. With regard to the visible adornment, this is the dress. With regard to the hidden adornment, this is things such as kohl, bangles and rings. 
According to another report, visible adornment includes clothes. That which is hidden includes anklets, earrings and bangles. 
Narrated by Ibn Jareer in his Tafseer, 18/117 
A similar interpretation was also narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas. 
See Adwa’ al-Bayaan, 6/196 
Therefore the scholars have said that it is obligatory for a woman to cover her face, hands and hidden adornments. This is what is regarded as more correct by a number of the scholars, including Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah. 
Al-Shanqeeti (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, when discussing this issue and after quoting the views of the scholars and stating that the report narrated from Ibn Mas’ood is more likely to be correct -: 
This view is the most correct opinion in our view; it is more on the safe side, farthest removed from suspicion and causes of fitnah. 
Adwa’ al-Bayaan, 6/192 
Make-up and the like, and henna, are kinds of adornment which it is not permissible for a Muslim woman to show to non-mahrams. 
Shaykh Muhammad al-Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen said:  
There is nothing wrong with using henna for adornment, especially for a married woman who adorns herself with it for her husband. As for unmarried women, the correct view is that it is permissible, but she should not show it to people because it is a kind of adornment. 
Fataawa al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah, 1/477 
But some doctors have said that using artificial make-up harms a woman’s skin. If this is proven then it should be avoided. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: 
If make-up beautifies a woman and does not cause her any harm, then there is nothing wrong with it, but I have heard that make-up damages the skin of the face, and that it therefore alters the skin of the face in an ugly way before the time when the skin changes as a result of ageing. I hope that women will ask their doctors about that. If that is proven, then using make-up is either haraam or makrooh at least, because everything that causes deformity in a person or makes him ugly is either haraam or makrooh. 
Fataawa al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah, 1/474 
Thirdly: 
With regard to a woman’s neck and ears showing from under her khimaar, this is haraam, The ears and neck are among the areas which a woman is commanded to conceal from non-mahram men; they are part of the beauty which it is forbidden to uncover in front of anyone except one's husband and mahrams. 
The fuqaha’ are agreed that a woman’s ears are ‘awrah and it is not permissible to show them to non-mahrams. 
Any kind of adornment that is connected to them – such as earrings – is also part of the hidden adornment which it is not permissible to show. 
Al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 2/376 
Concerning the conditions of hijaab, see question no. 6991. 
To sum up: 
It is not permissible for a husband to allow his wife to show her hidden adornments. He must tell her to wear proper hijaab otherwise the husband will be included among those whom sharee’ah counts as not having the proper protective jealousy concerning their honour. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There are three who will not enter Paradise and Allaah will not look at them on the Day of Resurrection: the one who disobeys his parents, the woman who imitates men, and the cuckold.” 
(Narrated by Ahmad; Ahmad Shaakir (6180) said, its isnaad is saheeh). 
His wife has to fear Allaah and observe proper hijaab. That will be good for her with regard to her religious commitment and before her Lord.

9619,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9619,Does Allaah delay the response to du’aa’ for the one whom He loves?,"I know there is a hadith qudsi that says in it that Allah (swt) told Gabrael (PBUH) that when a slave of His makes dua, and He likes this slave, he doesn't give him his request so that He can hear his repetition of the dua over and over. But if He doesnt like this slave, He tells  Gabrael to give him what he wants so He dont hear his voice.  My question is.. is that in every case? or are there exceptions?

This is the situation, i was a sinner and i repented and ive gone a long way. al-hamdolillah. i dont do da'wah because im busy with studying and helping my mother with my brothers and sisters, but i do send emails very often with important facts about Islam, reminders, teachings about 'Aqeedah and Fiqh, and stories that can serve as a reminder and lesson to all of us.  I (al-hamdolilah) am always saying athkaar, all day long and especially ""laa ilaha illa allah wahddaho la shareeka lah, lahom al-mol wa laho al-hamd wa howa 'ala kulli shay'ean qadeer""  I say that all day,, and i also always make dua for me and for others.  And recently ive noticed that most of the dua's i make happen soon after i pray them. al-hamdolillah, i say, but still i'm afraid that this is a sign that im not one of those that Allah likes. (I ask allah that this is not the case) And that Allah gives me what i prayed for so He (swt) doesnt hear my voice. Maybe it is because of my past? I dont know but wallahi this subject is really worrying me... I try so much to do everything that is right and to make up for my past...",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
Islam encourages us to make a lot of du’aa’, and not to be hasty in seeking a 
    response.  That is because du’aa’ is a great act of worship which is beloved to Allaah. Indeed there are texts which warn us against neglecting 
    du’aa’, because neglecting it is a sign of arrogance. 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And your Lord said: ‘Invoke Me [i.e. believe in My Oneness (Islamic 
    Monotheism) and ask Me for anything] I will respond to your (invocation). Verily, those who scorn My worship [i.e. do not invoke Me, and do not 
    believe in My Oneness, (Islamic Monotheism)] they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!’”
[Ghaafir 40:60]
It 
    was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “(The du’aa’) of any one of you 
    will be answered so long as he is not hasty in seeking a response and does not say, ‘I prayed but I have not had a response.’” 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5981; Muslim, 2735 
It was narrated from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allaah be pleased with him) that 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:  “There is no Muslim who calls upon Allaah with words in which there is no sin 
    or severing of family ties but Allaah will give him one of three things: either He will answer his prayer soon, or He will store it up for him in 
    the Hereafter, or He will remove something bad from him that is equivalent to what he is asking for.” They said, “Then we should make a great 
    amount of du’aa’.” He said, “Allaah is greater.” 
Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3573; classed as saheeh by al-Tirmidhi and others. 
Secondly: 
The hadeeth mentioned by the questioner is a very weak hadeeth (da’eef jiddan). 
    It was narrated from Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “If a person prays to Allaah and Allaah loves him, He says ‘O Jibreel, meet the need of this slave of Mine, but delay it, for I 
    love to hear his voice.’ If a person prays to Allaah and Allaah hates him, He says, ‘O Jibreel, meet the need of this slave of Mine and give it to 
    him immediately, for I hate to hear his voice.” 
Narrated by al-Tabaraani in al-Awsat, 8/216. Its isnaad includes Ishaaq ibn 
    ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Abi Farwah, who is matrook as stated in Majma’ al-Zawaa’id, 10/151 
If 
    it is understood that the hadeeth is very weak, it is not fit to be quoted as evidence. 
Thirdly: 
Undoubtedly if a person feels that Allaah has responded to him, this is a great 
    blessing which deserves that he should give thanks and praise, and continue doing righteous deeds and fearing Allaah, for these are among the 
    greatest means of Allaah answering du’aa’. It is a blessing, if it is true, and a person may feel envious of the one who is blessed in this 
    manner. Every Muslim wishes that his du’aa’ will be answered. This – in sha Allaah – is an indication that a person is righteous, truthful and 
    sincere. So he must continue to fear Allaah, do righteous deeds and avoid haraam things; this will make the blessing continue. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“If you give thanks (by accepting Faith and worshipping none but Allaah), I will give you more 
    (of My Blessings)”
[Ibraaheem 14:7]
Fourthly: 
What the questioner mentions about spreading goodness and da’wah is something that 
    will be good for her in this world and in the Hereafter in sha Allah. This is one of the kinds of kindness that bring good in this world and in 
    the Hereafter. We ask Allaah to support her, guide her and help her in that, and to give her the best reward.

      it true that Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab said that walking with
      shoes in the mosque is something which is allowed in Islam, and that
      visiting graves is haraam? Please advise us, may Allaah reward you with
      good.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Where
      did you get this from? We tell you that this is a big lie.
      
      
Imaam
      Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab (may Allaah have mercy on him) was a man of
      knowledge, a scholar. He did not say these things. What he urged people to
      do, as is written in his books, is to turn to Allaah when they pray, and
      to be focused in their prayer, in obedience to the words of Allaah
      (interpretation of the meaning):
      
      
“Successful
      indeed are the believers.
      
      
Those
      who offer their Salaah (prayers) with all solemnity and full
      submissiveness” [al-Mu’minoon 23:1-2]
      
      
-
      because the person who is praying must acknowledge the greatness of the
      One before Whom he is standing. So he should not move too much, as it says
      in the report: “If the heart is focused then the limbs will be still.”
      Some scholars attributed this to the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of
      Allaah be upon him), but al-Haafiz ibn Rajab al-Hanbali said: The
      Messenger 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not say
      this, and there is no saheeh isnaad reporting that he said, “If the
      heart is focused then the limbs will be still”- even though the meaning
      is sound. This is the saying of one of the salaf. And this is what
      Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab said.
With
      regard to walking with shoes in the mosque and his saying that this is
      allowed in Islam, this is not correct. Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab did
      not say that walking with shoes in the mosque is something which is
      allowed in Islam. He said the same as was narrated in the ahaadeeth, which
      is that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
      him) said: “When any one of you comes to the mosque, let him look at his
      shoes, and if he sees anything dirty on them, let him wipe them, because
      they may be purified by rubbing them with dust.” This refers to shoes
      and to the mosque at that time [which was simple and unfurnished].
      However, if the mosque is furnished [with carpets and the like], we should
      keep it clean from shoes and not enter wearing shoes, lest we make the
      place dirty by bringing in something unclean on our shoes. This was
      indicated by some of the scholars and is part of what Shaykh Muhammad ibn
      ‘Abd al-Wahhaab said. He did not say that it is allowed in Islam to
      enter the mosque with shoes.
With
      regard to it being haraam to visit graves, he did not say this at all.
      Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab followed the ahaadeeth, and the
      hadeeth says: “”I used to forbid you to visit graves, but now [you
      should] visit them, for they are a reminder of the Hereafter.”  (Narrated
      by Muslim, no. 977). And he (may Allaah have mercy on him) said to those
      who visit graves that when they visit them, they must abide by the
      etiquette of Islam and make du’aa’ as the Prophet 
 (peace and
      blessings of Allaah be upon him) taught his companions: when you enter the
      graveyard, say: “Peace be upon you, dwellers of these abodes, believers
      and Muslims. We will, whenever Allaah wills, join you. May Allaah have
      mercy on those of you who were first (to die) and those who were last. I
      beg of Allaah salvation for us and for you. O Allaah, deprive us not of
      reward (similar to theirs) and lead us not astray after they are gone, and
      forgive us and them.” (Saheeh Muslim,
      no. 974, 975)
      
      
This
      is what the ahaadeeth say, and Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab affirmed
      this in his books. But what he said was: People should not travel
      specifically to visit graves. This is the view of Ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab,
      in accordance with the hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed in al-Saheehayn,
      where it says that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
      him) said:
“Journeys
      should not be undertaken to visit (any place) except three: al-Masjid
      al-Haraam [in Makkah], this mosque of mine [in Madeenah] and al-Masjid
      al-Aqsaa [in al-Quds/Jerusalem].”  (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2/50;Muslim,
      827; al-Nasaa’i, 1/277-287). He said: This hadeeth indicates that
      it is not permissible to travel specifically to visit graves, but if you
      visit them in your own city, for example, or those that do not require
      travel specifically to visit them, then this is OK. The Messenger 
      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to visit graves, such as
      the graveyard of al-Baqee’, and he 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah
      be upon him)visited the
      graves of the shuhadaa’ (martyrs) and made du’aa’ for them. This is
      something which is well known. What is forbidden is travelling
      specifically to visit graves. This is something which we should not do,
      according to the hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed. Hence al-Qaadi ‘Iyaad
      al-Maaliki said: It is not permissible to travel specifically to visit
      graves. This was also the view of Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali, Ibn ‘Aqeel, Ibn
      Battah and a group of scholars. All that was said to you is not correct,

9640,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9640,Can You Do Wudu with Socks On?,What are the conditions for wiping over the socks? Please give the evidence for that.,"You can do wudu with socks on if the socks have been put on when you are in a state of purity and they are pure, and the wiping may be done within the time specified by Shari`ah.",,"Praise be to Allah.You can do wudu with socks on if you apply these four conditions: 

That they should have been put on when one was in a state of purity, i.e., when one has wudu. The evidence for that is what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to al-Mughirah ibn Shu’bah: “Don’t worry, because I put them on when I was clean.” 
That the khufuf (leather slippers which cover the ankle) or socks should be pure. If they are impure then it is not permissible to wipe over them. The evidence for that is that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) led his Companions in prayer one day wearing shoes, which he took off whilst he was praying. He said that Jibril had told him that there was something dirty/impure on them. This was narrated by Ahmad from the hadith of Abu Sa’id al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) in his Musnad. This indicates that it is not permissible to pray wearing anything that is impure, because if the impure thing is wiped over, the person will be contaminated by that impurity, so he cannot be considered to be pure. 
They may be wiped over when one is purifying oneself from minor ritual impurity (i.e., doing wudu after passing wind, urine or stools), not when one is in a state of major ritual impurity following sexual activity or when ghusl is required. The evidence for that is the hadith of Safwan ibn ‘Assal (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded us, when we were travelling, not to remove our khufuf for three days and three nights, except in the case of janabah. But we could keep them on and wipe over them in the case of stools, urine and sleeping.” This was narrated by Ahmad from the hadith of Safwan ibn ‘Assal (may Allah be pleased with him) in his Musnad. So the condition is that wiping the socks may be done when purifying oneself (doing wudu) from minor ritual impurity, and it is not permissible in the case of major ritual impurity, because of the hadith which we have mentioned here. 
That the wiping may be done within the time specified by Shari`ah , which is one day and one night in the case of one who is not travelling , and three days and three nights in the case of one who is travelling. This is because of the hadith of ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stated one day and one night for the one who is not travelling, and three days and three nights for the one who is travelling, i.e., for wiping over the khufuf.” This was narrated by Muslim. This period starts from the first time one wipes over the socks when doing wudu after some minor ritual impurity, and it ends twenty-four hours later for the one who is not travelling, and seventy-two hours later for the one who is travelling. So if we assume that a person purifies himself for Fajr prayer on Tuesday and remains tahir (pure, i.e., keeps his wudu) until ‘Isha prayer on Tuesday evening, then he sleeps and wakes up to pray Fajr on Wednesday, and he wipes his socks at five o’clock zawali time , then the period begins from 5 a.m. on Wednesday and lasts until 5 a.m. on Thursday. If we assume that he wiped his socks before 5 a.m then he can pray Fajr on Thursday with this wiping and pray as much as he wants as long as he remains tahir, because according to the most correct scholarly opinion, wudu is not broken when the time period for wiping over the socks expires. That is because the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not set a time limit for taharah, rather he set a time limit for wiping over the socks. Once that time limit expires, one cannot wipe over the socks again, but if a person remains in a state of taharah then his taharah is still valid, because this is what is implied by the shar’i evidence, and whatever is proven by shar’i evidence cannot be invalidated unless there is further shar’i evidence to that effect. There is no evidence to suggest that wudu is broken when the time limit for wiping over the socks expires, because what the basic principle is that he remains as he is (i.e., tahir) until it becomes apparent that this is no longer the case.  

These are the conditions which apply to wiping over the khufuf . There are other conditions which were mentioned by some of the scholars, but some of these are subject to further debate.

          (local custom), so that whatever is customarily regarded as travelling 
          is travelling, even if it is to a place that is close, and whatever 
          is not regarded as travelling – i.e. it is not called travelling – is

Based on the prophet(PBUH) hadith that Commerce is better than salary. The problem for a restaurant to be successfull Alcohool need to be served since it is the major driver(bring customers). We avoided this Business  because we know that this would be Haram and without  alcohool it wouldn't work. A friend advised us with a new formula  where the customer brings their own wine. We don't have to Buy it nor serve it nor sell it. I know this is a border line What is your view of this dilema?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
There is no such thing in the hadeeth of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) as that which the questioner mentions, “Commerce is better than a salary.” The closest thing is the hadeeth, “Nine-tenths of provision is in 
    trade,” which is a da’eef (weak) hadeeth that was classed as such by al-Albaani in Da’eef al-Jaami’, 2434. 
Secondly: 
What one of your friends has suggested to you, that the customers bring their own wine with 
    them to your restaurant, is false according to sharee’ah. It is bad advice, whether it is intended to cause you harm or it comes from one who is 
    ignorant and does not know the ruling of Allaah. 
That is because you will be answerable to Allaah about your restaurant, and it is not permissible 
    for you to allow sin to be committed in it. Drinking alcohol is haraam and no Muslim doubts that. It is a great evil, so how are you going to deal 
    with this evil? The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever among you sees an evil action, let him change it with 
    his hand (by taking action); if he cannot, then with his tongue (by speaking out); and if he cannot, then with his heart (by hating it and feeling 
    that it is wrong).”  (Narrated by Muslim, 49). 
Have you tried to change this evil by taking action, or by speaking out? 
There is another issue. 
It was narrated that Jaabir said: The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said: “Whoever believes in Allaah and the Last Day, let him not sit at a table at which alcohol is passed round.” 
(Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2801. This hadeeth has corroborating reports which render it saheeh. It 
    was classed as saheeh by al-Haafiz ibn Hajar in Fath al-Baari, 9/250). 
Do not forget that this table belongs to you and is in your place. What is meant is not only 
    sitting. Even if you are in the same place or the same restaurant, you are sharing with them in the sin, so how about if the place is your place? 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And it has already been revealed to you in the Book (this Qur’aan) that when you hear the 
    Verses of Allaah being denied and mocked at, then sit not with them, until they engage in a talk other than that; (but if you stayed with them) 
    certainly in that case you would be like them”
[al-Nisa’ 4:140]
Ibn Katheer said: This means, if you commit the forbidden action after you have heard that it 
    is forbidden, and you agree to sit with them in the place in which they are denying the Verses of Allaah and mocking them, and you approve of 
    that, then you are joining with them in what they are doing. Hence Allaah says, “you would be like them” in sin, as it says in the hadeeth, 
    “Whoever believes in Allaah and the Last Day, let him not sit at a table at which alcohol is passed round.” 
(Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 1/567, 568) 
And there is another issue: 
What if a person were to say that he wants to open a hotel in order to make money, and someone 
    were to advise him to let anyone bring a woman there to sleep with her, because this will attract customers! Would you agree with this advice? The 
    answer is, No, definitely not. 
The same applies to the one who told you that if you want to make money you have to let the 
    customers bring their own wine with them. There is no difference. In both cases, you would not be offering wine or women, but you would be 
    allowing people to commit haraam actions in front of your eyes in your place. 
Based on that, it is haraam for you to allow anyone to bring something that Allaah has 
    forbidden and drink it in your restaurant. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out 
    (from every difficulty).
And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine”
[al-Talaaq 65:2-3]
So you should not be deceived by what people say when they tell you that you will not make any

9691,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9691,The Quran and medicine,"I heard in a lecture that medical scientists or doctors claim that many medicines&treatements have been discovererd&propounded by inferring facts frm the Holy Quran.  
Now my question is, Is that all regarding medicine is mentioned in the Holy Quran? Or is there more left which we've to still put into use? 
I'm asking this question with regards to an earnest request frm a friend of mine, a hindu named Vignesh and he asked me whether there r matters left still in the Holy Quran to control some of these deadly diseases.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
Allah sent Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) with a religion that covers all aspects of life, as Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) left us and no bird flapped its wings in the sky except that he had taught us some knowledge about it. 
(Narrated by Ahmad, 20399. See Majma’ al-Zawaa’id, 8/263. al-Haythami said: it was narrated by al-Tabaraani and its men are the men of saheeh apart from Muhammad ibn ‘Abd-Allah ibn Yazeed al-Muqri’ who is thiqah (trustworthy)). 
Islam came to meet the needs of people in all aspects of their lives.  
Secondly: 
What is narrated in the Sunnah from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) complements what is in the Quran. These two sources are the principal sources for Muslims. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has told us that Allah has not sent down any disease but He has also sent down a cure for it. 
It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has not sent down any disease but He has also sent down a cure for it.” 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5678. 
Thirdly: 
What the questioner has mentioned, that some Muslims say that many remedies were discovered through the Holy Quran, we say that this is somewhat exaggerated. 
The Quran is not a book of medicine or geography or geology as some Muslims like to say to westerners. Rather it is a book of guidance for mankind and one of the greatest of its miracles is its eloquence and the ideas and concepts that it contains. This is the main aspect of its miraculous nature. Allah revealed it to His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) at a time when eloquence had reached great heights, so this book came to amaze those people and challenge them in their area of expertise, to prove to them that it was from Allah. 
This is not strange, and it is nothing new in religion. The signs of Moosa (peace be upon him) – his stick and his hand – were of the kind that was prevalent during his time, which was magic (sihr). The signs of ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) – raising the dead and healing the blind and lepers – were of the kind that his people were skilled in and that was widespread among them, which was medicine. 
Hence we say that the greatest feature of the Quran is its eloquence. Scholars nowadays are still discovering new aspects of its eloquence through their study of its verses.  
This does not mean that there is no other miraculous aspects to the Quran. Rather in some verses Allah mentions things about the design of the human body, the stages of its creation and development, some natural phenomena, etc. 
But with regard to cures for various diseases, as the questioner mentions, the Quran is a healing for the believers. This includes healing the heart (mental or spiritual disease) and physical healing. Allah mentions honey in the Quran and says that it is a healing for mankind. And He mentions the principle of preserving good health and guarding against sickness. So whoever says that the Quran says a lot about medicine in this regard is right, but whoever goes beyond that is exaggerating. Rather this is a kind of exaggeration coined by some Muslims. The Quran is not a book of medicine. There are some diseases that did not exist previously, so how could their cure come – according to what the questioner says – before they appeared? 
Fourthly: 
(a)The following are some of the verses which indicate that the Quran is healing:
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And We send down of the Quran that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe”
[al-Isra’ 17:82]
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
Allah says “And We send down of the Quran that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe”. The correct view is that the word min (translated here as “of”) serves to explain the nature of the Quran as a whole, not to refer to parts of it and not other parts.  
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O mankind! There has come to you a good advice from your Lord (i.e. the Quran, enjoining all that is good and forbidding all that is evil), and a healing for that which is in your hearts”
[Yoonus 10:57]
The Quran is the complete healing for all mental, spiritual and physical diseases, all diseases of this world and the Hereafter. But not everyone is guided to use it for the purpose of healing. If the sick person uses the Quran for healing in the proper way, and applies it to his disease with sincerity, faith, complete acceptance and firm conviction, fulfilling all its conditions, then no disease can resist it. 
How can disease resist the words of the Lord of heaven and earth which, if He had revealed it to the mountains they would have crumbled and if He had revealed it to the earth it would have broken it apart? There is no sickness, spiritual or physical, but in the Quran there is that which indicates its remedy, its cause and how to protect against it for those who are blessed with understanding of His Book. 
Zaad al-Ma’aad, 4/352 
(b)The Quran contains the treatment for hearts and souls, and as such it is a means of expelling all sicknesses from the body. In this regard the Quran is a healing and a remedy for many diseases.
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
We and others have tried this on many occasions and we have seen that it works in ways that physical remedies do not. Indeed we now regard physical medicine as the doctors regard folk medicine. This is in accordance with the law of divine wisdom, not contrary to it, but the causes of healing are many and varied. When the heart is in contact with the Lord of the Worlds, the Creator of the disease and the remedy, the Controller of nature Who directs it as He wills, he has other remedies apart from the remedies that are sought by the heart that is far away from Him and that turns away from Him. It is known that when a person’s spirits are high and his body is in good shape, they cooperate in warding off disease and suppressing it, so if a person is in high spirits and physical good shape, finds comfort in being close to his Creator, loving Him, enjoying remembrance of Him (dhikr), devoting all his strength and power for His sake and focusing on Him, seeking His help, putting his trust in Him, how can anyone deny that this is the greatest medicine or that this spiritual power gives him the means to ward off pain and defeat it completely? No one would deny this but the most ignorant of people, those who are furthest away from Allah and the most hard-hearted and unaware of human nature. 
Zaad al-Ma’aad 4/12 
(c)In the Quran there is Soorat al-Faatihah which is a ruqyah to be recited as a prayer for healing.
It was narrated that Abu Sa’eed (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “A group of the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) set out on a journey and traveled until they stopped in (the land of) one of the Arab tribes. They asked them for hospitality but they refused to welcome them. The chief of that tribe was stung by a scorpion and they tried everything but nothing helped them. Some of them said, ‘Why don’t you go to those people who are camped (near us), maybe you will find something with them.’ So they went to them and said, ‘O people, our chief has been stung by a scorpion and we have tried everything but nothing helped him. Can any of you do anything?’ One of them said, ‘Yes, by Allah, I will recite ruqyah for him, but by Allah we asked you for hospitality and you did not welcome us, so I will not recite ruqyah for you until you give us something in return.’ Then they agreed upon a flock of sheep.’ Then he went and spat drily and recited over him Al-hamdu Lillaahi Rabb il-‘Aalameen [Soorat al-Faatihah]. (The chief) got up as if he was released from a chain and started walking, and there were no signs of sickness on him. They paid them what they agreed to pay. Some of them (i.e. the companions) then suggested to divide their earnings among themselves, but the one who performed the ruqyah said, ‘Do not divide them until we go to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and tell him what happened, then wait and see what he tells us to do.’ So they went to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and told him what had happened. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked, ‘How did you know that it (al-Faatihah) is a ruqyah?’ Then he added, ‘You have done the right thing. Share out (the flock of sheep) and give me a share too.’ And the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) smiled.”   
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2156; Muslim, 2201 
Ibn al-Qayyim said concerning Soorat al-Faatihah:  
Whoever is guided by Allah and is given good insight to understand the deep meaning of this soorah and what it contains of Tawheed, understanding of the Divine nature, the names, attributes and actions of Allah, the Divine decree, the Resurrection, rejecting any misconception that undermines the concept of the Oneness of the Divine Lordship and Divine nature, complete trust in Allah and referring all one’s affairs to the One Who has full control of all things – to Him be all praise, for all goodness is in His hand and to Him all things return – and feeling in need of Him in seeking guidance that is the root of happiness in this world and in the Hereafter, will realize the connection between the contents of this soorah and bringing good and warding off evil. He will understand that ultimate goodness and blessing is connected to this soorah and is dependent upon understanding it and acting upon it. Then this soorah will make him independent of many other kinds of medicine and ruqyah, and it will open the door to a great deal of goodness and ward off a great deal of evil. 
Zaad al-Ma’aad, 4/347 
(d)The Quran mentions the principle of maintaining good health.
Ibn al-Qayyim said: 
The basic principles of medicine are three: prevention, maintaining good health, and removing harmful substances from the body. 
Allah has mentioned them all together, to His Prophet and his ummah in three places in His Book. 
He prevented the sick person from using water lest it harm him, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And if you are ill, or on a journey, or one of you comes after answering the call of nature, or you have been in contact with women (by sexual relations) and you find no water, perform Tayammum with clean earth and rub therewith your faces and hands (Tayammum)”
[al-Nisa’ 4:43]
Allah allowed the sick person to do tayammum to protect him, just as He permitted it to the one who has no water. 
Allah says concerning the maintenance of good health: 
“and whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number [of days which one did not observe Sawm (fasts) must be made up] from other days”
[al-Baqarah 2:185]
The traveller is allowed to break his fast during Ramadaan, to protect his health lest the combination of fasting and the difficulties of travel weakens him and affects his health. 
And Allah said concerning the removal of harmful things by shaving the head of the person in ihraam (for Hajj or ‘Umrah): 
“And whosoever of you is ill or has an ailment in his scalp (necessitating shaving), he must pay a Fidyah (ransom) of either observing Sawm (fasts) (three days) or giving Sadaqah (charity — feeding six poor persons) or offering sacrifice (one sheep)”
[al-Baqarah 2:196]
So if a person has an ailment in his scalp when he is in ihraam, he is permitted to shave his head and remove the harmful thing or the bad substance that is causing lice to develop – as happened to Ka’b ibn ‘Ajrah – or if it is causing sickness to develop. 
These three matters are the basic principles of medicine. We have mentioned an example of each one in order to point out the blessing of Allah to His slaves in preventing sickness, protecting their health and removing harmful substances from them, as a mercy and kindness towards His slaves, for He is the Most Kind, Most Merciful. 
Zaad al-Ma’aad, 1/164, 165 
Ibn al-Qayyim said: On one occasion I discussed this with one of the chief doctors of Egypt, and he said: By Allah if I had to travel to the west to obtain these benefits that would not be too much – or words to that effect. 
Ighaathat al-Lahfaan, 1/25 
(e)Mention of honey in the Quran, and that it is a healing for mankind.
 Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“There comes forth from their [bees’] bellies, a drink of varying colour wherein is healing for men”
[al-Nahl 16:69]
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
With regard to the Prophet’s guidance concerning drinking, it is the most perfect guidance that maintains good health. He used to drink honey mixed with cold water. This is very healthy and no one can understand how healthy it is except the most prominent doctors. For drinking honey on an empty stomach dissolves phlegm, cleanses the stomach, reduces its viscosity, washes away waste matter, warms it up a little and opens its inlet and exit. It has a similar effect on the liver, kidneys and urethra. It is more beneficial to the stomach than any other kind of sweet that enters it. However it may cause side effects in people who are suffering from jaundice because it is hot and jaundice is hot, so it may aggravate it; in order to avoid this effect vinegar may be added, then honey will become beneficial and drinking it will be more useful than many or most of the drinks that are made from sugar, especially for those who are not used to these drinks, for if they drink them they will not suit them as well as honey does, or even come close.  
With regard to drinking it when it is collected and well-prepared, this is one of the most beneficial things for the body, and one of the greatest means of preserving health; it is very refreshing and energizing, and it is good for the liver and heart. If it is well-prepared it provides nutrition and makes food reach all parts of the body in the most effective manner. 
Zaad al-Ma’aad, 4/224, 225 
And he said (may Allah have mercy on him): 
Honey contains great benefits, for it cleanses impurities from the veins and stomach etc, whether it is eaten or applied to the skin. It is good for the elderly, the phlegmatic and those whose humours are cold and wet. It is nourishing, aids digestion, energizes, makes unpleasant medicine palatable, is good for the liver and chest, is a diuretic and helps to ease coughs caused by phlegm. If it is drunk warm mixed with rosewater it is beneficial for one who has been bitten by a scorpion or who has consumed opium. If it is drunk on its own mixed with water, it is good for the one who has been bitten by a rabid dog or eaten poisonous mushrooms. If fresh meat is placed in honey, it will stay fresh for three months, as will cucumbers, pumpkins and eggplants. Many fruits can be kept in it for six months. It will also preserve a dead body, and it is known as the trustworthy preserver. If the body of one who is afflicted with lice is painted with honey, it will kill the lice and their eggs. It makes the hair long, beautiful and smooth. If used on the eyes like kohl it clears the vision. If the teeth are brushed with it, it whitens the teeth and makes them bright, and keeps the gums healthy. It opens the veins and induces menstruation. If taken on an empty stomach it takes away phlegm and cleanses the stomach, clearing away waste matter and restoring the correct temperature. It does likewise to the liver, kidneys and urethra.
 As well as all this, it has no side effects and causes little harm. It may cause side effects in one who is suffering from jaundice, but that may be counteracted by vinegar and the like, in which case it becomes very beneficial for him.
 It is a kind of nourishment, a kind of medicine, a kind of drink, a kind of sweet, a kind of cream. There is nothing that has been created for us for a similar purpose that is better than it, or even comes close. The ancient peoples relied on it, and in most of the books of the ancients there is no mention of sugar at all and it was unknown to them, for it is something that is very new. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to drink honey mixed with water on an empty stomach, and this is the secret of maintaining good health that no one can understand except one who is intelligent and blessed.

9694,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9694,Can a woman look for her life partner herself?,"I have been accused repeatedly for finding a boyfriend while wearing hijab. Personally i don't think wearing a hijab should stop me from choosing a suitable partner. When i found him, i showed him to my parents asking for their openion on him. Some say ""better not to wear hijab at all than doing this"". Am i right to say that Islam does not prevent any girls from finding a suitable partner and wearing hijab has nothing to do with it?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
The Muslim woman must know that she is obliged to wear hijaab and observe proper Islamic hijaab at all times. It is not permissible for a woman to make a wanton display of herself (tabarruj). Tabarruj is a major sin for which the one who does it deserves the wrath and punishment of Allah.  A woman, as the saying goes, is a jewel, and when she is shown to people and makes a wanton display of herself she loses her value. 
So I advise the questioner and every Muslim woman to adhere to proper Islamic hijaab, which is pleasing to Allah and is an act of obedience to Him, and is a means of Allah guiding His slave and making things easier for him. 
Secondly: 
With regard to marriage, it may be obligatory if a man or woman longs for marriage and fears falling into immoral ways. It is also the Sunnah of the Prophets (peace be upon them). 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And indeed We sent Messengers before you (O Muhammad), and made for them wives and offspring” [al-Ra’d 13:38]
Thirdly: 
There is a difference between a Muslim woman looking for a husband and her mixing with and talking to men for that purpose, and meeting by accident a man who she thinks is a potential husband. The former is contrary to modesty, for a woman is required to be of modest character and shy, which is an adornment and beauty for women; the virgin is the epitome of modesty as it says in the hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him): “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to be more shy than the virgin in her seclusion, and if he disliked something it would be known from his face.” 
Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5751; Muslim, 2320 
A woman can do something better than that, which is to make du’aa’ asking Allah to give her a good and righteous husband. Du’aa’ is one of the best things with which a Muslim may equip himself and the best way in which a Muslim may seek to meet his needs. She can also speak to some of her Muslim sisters whose religious commitment and honesty she trusts to tell her of someone who can tell a young Muslim man who wants to get married about a Muslim girl. This is better than her doing something that is contrary to modesty. 
Fourthly: 
Undoubtedly the one who told you to take off the hijab and that that is better than wearing it is wrong. How can a woman give up her religious commitment and hijab and ignore something that Allah has enjoined upon her and said that if she forsakes it then she will deserve the wrath and punishment of Allah and will not be granted His support? 
The Muslim woman must adhere to this virtue which many Muslim women have forsaken, for it is the symbol of the Muslim woman, a sign of her commitment, sincere faith and piety.   
I advise the sister to fear Allah and to adhere to hijab, and Allah will help her and make her life easier for her. And Allah is the One Whose help we seek.
