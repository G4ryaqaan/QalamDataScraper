23104,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/23104,Is it permissible to put the sperm of the husband and the egg of the wife in the uterus of the second wife?,"Ahmad has two wives; the first wife cannot have children, and the second wife can, praise be to Allah. In this modern, scientific era, doctors are able, by Allah’s leave, to put the egg of the second wife and the sperm of the husband in a test tube so that they can be mixed and the egg can be fertilized, then he can put it in the womb of the wife who cannot have children, so that the foetus can develop until she gives birth. Is this permissible in the light of the Qur’an and Sunnah? Some people say that it is permissible, by analogy with breastfeeding; in other words, just as it is permissible for the child to be nourished by her milk in her lap, it is permissible for him to be nourished by her blood in her womb.",,,"Praise be to Allah.This method of fertilisation, putting the egg with the husband’s sperm in the womb of the other wife is a method that is not permissible according to Islamic teaching, and many of the scholars are of the view that it is prohibited. Two statements concerning it have been issued by the Islamic Fiqh Council belonging to the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, and by the Islamic Fiqh Council belonging to the Muslim World League, which originally thought that this method was permissible, then retracted that view. There follows some of what was mentioned in these two statements:
1.. The statement of the Fiqh Council belonging to the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (formerly the Organisation of the Islamic Conference):
The session of the Islamic Fiqh Council that was held 8-13 Safar 1407 AH/11-16 October 1986.
After examining the issue of artificial insemination (test-tube babies), studying the research presented, and listening to the explanations given by experts and doctors, and after discussing the matter, the council determined:
That the methods of artificial insemination that are known at present are seven:
1.. Fertilisation occurs between sperm taken from the husband and an egg taken from a woman who is not his wife, then the embryo is implanted in the wife’s uterus.
2.. Fertilisation occurs between the sperm of a man who is not the husband and an egg taken from the wife, then the embryo is implanted in the wife’s uterus.
3.. Fertilisation occurs between the sperm and egg of the couple, then the embryo is implanted in the uterus of a woman who volunteers to bear it (surrogate pregnancy).
4.. Fertilisation occurs externally between the sperm of a man and the egg of a woman [not of the married couple] and the embryo is implanted in the wife’s uterus.
5.. Fertilisation occurs externally between the husband’s sperm and the wife’s egg, then the embryo is implanted in the uterus of the other wife.
6.. Sperm is taken from the husband and an egg is taken from his wife and fertilisation occurs externally, then the embryo is implanted in the wife’s uterus.
7.. Sperm is taken from the husband and injected into the right place in his wife’s vagina or uterus, so that fertilisation may occur internally.
The council determined:
The first five methods are all haraam according to Islamic teachings, and are to be completely banned because of the way in which they are done, or because of what results from them of mixing of lineage and the child not being brought up with his real mother, and other matters that are contrary to Islamic teachings.
Regarding the sixth and seventh methods, the council thinks that there is nothing wrong with using them in the case of necessity, whilst affirming that it is essential to take all necessary precautions. End quote.

2.. The statement of the Islamic Fiqh Council belonging to the Muslim World League:
Praise be to Allah and blessings and peace be upon our master and Prophet Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and upon his family and companions. To proceed:
The Islamic Fiqh Council, in its eighth session, held in the headquarters of the Muslim World League in Makkah al-Mukarramah, Saturday 28 Rabee‘ al-Aakhir 1405 – Monday 7 Jumaada al-Oola 1405 AH (19-28 January 1985 CE) examined the concerns expressed by some of its members regarding what the council had permitted in the second clause of the fifth statement having to do with artificial insemination and test-tube babies, which was issued during its seventh session that was held 11-16 Rabee‘ al-Aakhir 1404 AH, the text of which was:
“Regarding the seventh method, in which the sperm and egg are taken from the married couple, and after fertilisation in the laboratory, the fertilised egg is implanted in the uterus of the other wife of the same husband, as she volunteers willingly to carry that pregnancy for her co-wife, who has had a hysterectomy: it appears to the council that this is permissible in the case of necessity, in accordance with the general conditions that have been mentioned.
Summary of the concerns:
The other wife, in whose uterus the fertilised egg of the first wife is implanted, may become pregnant before her uterus closes following implantation of the fertilised egg, as a result of her husband having intercourse with her around the time that the fertilised egg is implanted, then she may give birth to twins and not know which came from the fertilised egg and which resulted from intercourse with her husband. As a result, it will be not possible to know who is the mother of which twin. Moreover, one of the two embryos may die in the early stages of pregnancy, and not be expelled except with the birth of the other, and it will not be known whether the surviving child grew from the fertilised egg or from the pregnancy that resulted from the husband having intercourse with her. This would result in mixing of lineages and it would not be known who the true mother is of either child, and this would affect rulings that are connected to that. All of this dictates that the council should retract its ruling regarding the case mentioned.
The council also listened to opinions presented by gynaecologists and obstetricians who attended the session and confirmed the possibility that a pregnancy could result from intercourse with the husband at the same time as the pregnancy resulting from the implanting of the fertilised egg, and that could lead to mixing of lineages in the manner mentioned in the concerns referred to.
After discussing the topic and exchanging views on it, the council decided to retract its view regarding the permissibility of the seventh method referred to in the statement previously issued by the Council in its seventh session held in 1404 AH. End quote.
Qaraaraat al-Majma‘ al-Fiqhi (p. 159-161).
Based on that:
It is not permissible to take the sperm of the husband and the egg of the wife and put this mixture in the uterus of the husband’s other wife.

23194,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/23194,Du’aa’ is suspended between heaven and earth until you send blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him),Is this hadeeth saheeh: “Every du’aa’ is suspended until one sends blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)”?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.This hadeeth was narrated 
    by al-Tirmidhi (486) from ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with 
    him) who said: “Du’aa’ is suspended between heaven and earth and none of it 
    is taken up until you send blessings upon your Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him).” Ibn Katheer said: Its isnaad is jayyid. 
    It was classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
It was narrated by 
    al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah (2035) from the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and he mentioned corroborating 
    reports, then he said: “In conclusion, when all these isnaads and 
    corroborating reports are taken into account, the hadeeth is hasan at the 
    very least, in sha Allaah.” 
What was narrated by 
    al-Tirmidhi is mawqoof, with an isnaad ending at ‘Umar, but it is regarded 
    as coming under the heading of marfoo’ (i.e., it may be regarded as 
    attributable to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him)). 
Al-Haafiz al-‘Iraaqi 
    said: 
Although this report is 
    mawqoof, such matters cannot be spoken of on the basis of personal opinion 
    (i.e., the Sahaabah did not speak on the basis of personal opinion on 
    matters of worship), rather this is a tawqeefi matter (i.e., we must adhere 
    to what is prescribed in the Qur’aan and Sunnah and not worship Allaah in 
    any way except that which has been prescribed), so it is regarded as coming 
    under the heading of marfoo’ (i.e., it may be regarded as attributable to 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)). Al-Qaadi Abu 
    Bakr ibn al-‘Arabi commented, after quoting these words from ‘Umar: ‘Umar 
    would not have said such a thing unless he had heard it from the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), because this is not a 
    matter that can be worked out by means of human reasoning. 
This hadeeth indicates 
    that it is mustahabb to send blessings upon the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) when making du’aa’. 
It seems that this is not 
    a condition of du’aa’, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) did not do this in all his du’aa’s; rather it may be 
    understood that this is mustahabb. 
And the scholars have 
    stated that three categories of sending blessing upon the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when making du’aa’. 
Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd said 
    in his book Tasheeh al-Du’aa’ (p. 23): 
The best category of 
    sending blessings upon the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) is at the beginning of the du’aa’, in the middle and at the end. 
    It is like wings for the du’aa’ with which it soars up to the clouds of the 
    sky. 
The second category is 
    sending blessings upon him at the beginning and end of the du’aa’. 
The third category is 
    sending blessings upon him at the beginning. 
These categories were 
    also mentioned by Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) in his book
    Jala’ al-Afhaam, p. 531-535. 
Al-Tirmidhi (3477) 
    narrated from Fadaalah ibn ‘Ubayd (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When any one 
    of you prays, let him begin by praising Allaah, then let him send blessings 
    upon the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), then let 
    him ask for whatever he wants.” 
Classed as saheeh by 
    al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
Al-Tabaraani narrated 
    that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood said: If any one of you wants to ask (of 
    Allaah), let him begin by praising Allaah as He deserves to be praised, then 
    let him send blessings upon the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him), then let him ask after that, for that is more likely to be 
    answered. 
This was quoted by 
    al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 3204. 
Abu Sulaymaan al-Daaraani 
    said: Whoever wants to ask Allaah for what he needs, let him start by 
    sending blessings upon the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him), then ask for what he needs, then end his prayer with blessings 
    upon the Prophet, for his sending blessings upon the Prophet will be 
    accepted, and Allaah is too generous to refuse what comes in between.
