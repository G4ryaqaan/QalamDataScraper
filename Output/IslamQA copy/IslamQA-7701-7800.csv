      Britain","I
      live in England a country once know to be a Christian nation, but today it
      is a completely secular country with no state religion, furthermore nearly
      all ceremonies are carried without invoking the name of Allah.My question is
      that if a Muslim couple marry
      in one of this country’s registration marriage offices, for the purpose
      of being recognised by the state as a married couple would it be
      considered a valid nikah despite it being conducted by akafir
      and without Allah (SWT) name being mentioned?",,,"Praise be to Allah.There 
  are four essentials in the marriage ceremony (nikaah), as stated in the following 
  guidelines:
“Any 
  marriage ceremony in which four people – the husband, the (wife’s) guardian 
  and two witnesses – are not present, is null and void.”
And 
  the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
  him) said: “There is no nikaah except with a walee (guardian) and two witnesses.” 
  (See question #2127).
If 
  the wife is Muslim and the husband is Muslim, the walee must also be Muslim, 
  because a kaafir cannot be the walee of a Muslim. The person who is in charge 
  of the Muslims’ affairs in that country can take the place of a walee. The marriage 
  contract must be conducted in accordance with the Islamic sharee’ah, then there 
  is nothing wrong with confirming it through official channels in order to prevent 
  any problems and avoid any embarrassment.May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

I have heard different opinions in reference to this, such as some brothers have told me that a minimum of 40 people are required while others have said 2. A different source has also said that only 2 people can constitute a congregation for Jumu`ah prayers. Can you please clarify this question for me?","There is no proven evidence which states that a specific number is required for Jumu`ah prayer; for the prayer to be valid, it is sufficient for there to be three or more people.",,"Praise be to Allah.The Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas was asked the following question:
What is the number of men required for Jumu`ah prayer to be valid? Some people say that it is not valid with less than forty men, and if there is one less than that, they should pray Zuhr.
They replied: 
“Establishing Jumu`ah prayers is obligatory upon the Muslims in their villages on Fridays, and it is necessary for there to be a congregation in order for the Jumu`ah prayer to be valid. There is no proven evidence which states that a specific number is required; for the prayer to be valid it is sufficient for there to be three or more people. 
It is not permissible for a person who is obliged to pray Jumu`ah to pray Zuhr in its place when there are less than forty people present according to the correct scholarly view. 
And Allah is the source of strength. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad and his family and Companions, and grant them peace.”

7721,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7721,"His wife does not want to wear hijaab
      and he fears for his young daughter","My wife is not wearing Hijab although she is a strong beleiver and practicing all Salats on time etc. We are both Engineers and we have 2 young daughters (2 and 5 Years. I am worried that my children will also go away from wearing hijab if they see their mother not wearing it as well. I've tried many times to convince her to put it (she has read the relevant sourates) but I've stopped doing that when I felt that she would reject whatever she was already on. 
My question is as a husband and father, shall I force her to wear it anyway to preserve the future of the daughters or shall I keep patient untill Allah guides her? 
My second question is are we (the husbands) responsible in front of Allah regarding weather or not our wives / daughters wear hijab or not?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Strong
      faith must have effects which can be seen in a person's appearance and
      conduct. If a person persists in sin, this is a sign of weak faith.
 What
      you have to do is try to plant the seeds of faith in her heart and help it
      to grow strong. What is meant by that is the kind of faith that will
      motivate a person to behave in accordance with the sharee’ah. Then try
      to instill in her a love of the hijaab and of righteous deeds, such as
      explaining the benefits of hijaab and how good it is, and giving her books
      and audio tapes, if these are available, which speak about that. One of
      the most important means which will help to achieve this is to put her in
      touch – in an indirect manner – with righteous women who wear the
      hijaab and try to have frequent family gatherings with righteous
      relatives.
If
      you do this, you will have tried various means of convincing her. Then you
      will have to oblige her in an appropriate fashion and not allow her to go
      out to public places without hijaab. (It is important to explain to your
      daughter that hijaab is obligatory and tell her about Allaah’s ruling on
      hijaab, even if she realizes that her mother is falling short. You have to
      explain it to her at a level that she can understand so that she will see
      that there is a difference between the rulings of sharee’ah and the way
      her mother is behaving. Who knows – perhaps she will advise her mother,
      in the moving and innocent manner of children – to wear hijaab).
 With
      regard to the second question, there is no doubt that fathers are
      responsible if their wives and daughters do not wear hijaab and do not
      adhere to the rulings of sharee’ah, as Allaah says (interpretation of
      the meaning):
“O
      you who believe! Ward off yourselves and your families against a Fire
      (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones” [al-Tahreem 66:6]
And as the
      Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
“Each of you
      is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock… the man is a shepherd
      over the members of his household and is responsible for his flock…”
But if a person
      does all that he can and strives his utmost, but does not achieve any
      results, Allaah will excuse him and will not punish him; on the contrary,
      He will reward him for his efforts, and Allaah does not cause the reward
      for any good deed to be lost.",Written by Shaykh Muhammad al-Duwaysh
7722,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7722,"His father is a very angry person who swears a lot, and there are a lot of arguments in the house","I am a God fearing Muslim and I need some advise.  

My father is a very angry person. He yells and swears almost non-stop. When he really losses it he breaks things around the house. He's tried to hit my mother once but we stopped him. He calls us prostitutes and homosexuals when he's mad. When he's not he claims he's a good Muslim. I printed out the article I found on your site about controlling one's anger, but he took it lightly. 

I am not in need of him nor is any of my siblings. I find it hard to believe that even under these circumstances we must honor him when he stoops to the lowest levels to insult us. He can also be dangerous, he threatens to hurt us and I am afraid that one day he will deliver. 

What is the ruling on honoring this type of father? Can we move out?",,,"Praise be to Allah.If you are not causing 
          his anger then there is no blame on you. But at the same time you are 
          obliged to treat him kindly and honour him. Allaah has enjoined honouring 
          one’s parents even if they believe in shirk (associating others in worship 
          with Allaah), so how about those whose sin is less than that?
With regard to your 
          moving out, if he agrees to that and it will be better for him, then 
          there is nothing wrong with it. Otherwise, strive to be patient in putting 
          up with what he does to you, for that will not be lost, and you will 
          meet it before Allaah (i.e., it will count in your favour on the Day 
          of Resurrection).
If a man who is employed 
          can put up with bad treatment from a boss, and bears his anger and insults 
          with patience for the sake of earning a living and keeping his job, 
          then you should certainly be able to put up with your father’s bad treatment 
          and insults for the sake of pleasing Allaah and earning His reward. 
          If he dies after you have been patient with him, you will not regret 
          it, but if he dies when you are opposing him and shunning him, you might 
          blame yourself and say, “If only I had been patient, if only I had put 
          up with him…” I hope that you will convey my salaams to your father 
          and tell him that whoever strives against his own nafs (self) and does 
          not get angry will attain Paradise, as the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us. Tell him that destroying 
          furniture is a waste of money and is something which is haraam. According 
          to a saheeh hadeeth, the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade us to waste money. 
          And tell him that the Prophet  (peace 
          and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to restrain his tongue, so 
          let him follow his example, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Indeed 
          in the Messenger of Allaah (Muhammad) you have a good example to follow” 
          
[al-Ahzaab 
          33:21] 
If your father gets 
          angry, do not try to advise him when he is in the heat of his anger, 
          for he might persist and get carried away. Offer him advice when his 
          anger has ceased and he has calmed down, for then he will be more likely 
          to respond. Make the person with whom your father isangry go away quietly 
          so as not to make matters worse. There is nothing wrong with you defending 
          your mother, in fact this is required of you, but not by means of you 
          physically fighting with your father. Rather you should take your mother 
          quietly away from the scene after reminding your father of Allaah and 
          advising him to seek refuge with Allaah from the Shaytaan. May Allaah 
          help you and may He help us and you to do all that is good.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
7726,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7726,"The importance of
      al-Quds for the Muslims – and do the Jews have any right to it?","As a muslim, I am always told that the city of Jerusalem is important to us.  But why? I am aware that Prophet Yaqoob built the Asqa Mosque in it and that Prophet Muhammad (p.b.u.h) led the previous Prophets in prayer signigying the unity of the message and all divine revelations; are there any other major reason or is it just because it is that we are dealing with Jews.  It seems to me that the Jews have more stake to it.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: with
      regard to the importance of Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem), you should know
      – may Allaah bless you –that the virtues of Bayt al-Maqdis are many:
-Allaah has
        described it in the Qur’aan as being blessed. He said (interpretation
        of the meaning): “Glorified
        (and Exalted) be He (Allaah) Who took His slave (Muhammad) for a journey
        by night from Al-Masjid Al-Haraam (at Makkah) to
        Al-Masjid Al-Aqsaa (in Jerusalem), the neighbourhood whereof
        We have blessed…” [al-Israa’ 17:1].
        Al-Quds is part of the neighbourhood surrounding the mosque and hence it
        is blessed.
-Allaah has described
      it as being holy, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): “[Moosa
      said:] O my people! Enter the holy land (Palestine) which Allaah has
      assigned to you…” [al-Maa’idah 5:21]
-In al-Quds there is
      al-Masjid al-Aqsaa, and one prayer there is equivalent to two hundred and
      fifty prayers elsewhere.
It
      was reported that Abu Dharr (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: we were
      discussing, in the presence of the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of
      Allaah be upon him), which of them was more virtuous, the mosque of the
      Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or
      Bayt al-Maqdis. The Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of
      Allaah be upon him) said: One prayer in my mosque is better than four
      prayers there, but it is still a good place of prayer. Soon there will
      come a time when if a man has a spot of land as big as his horse’s rope
      from which he can see Bayt al-Maqdis, that will be better for him than the
      whole world. (Narrated and
      classed as saheeh by al-Haakim, 4/509. Al-Dhahabi and al-Albaani agreed
      with him, as stated in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, at the end
      of the discussion of hadeeth no. 2902). 
 One
      prayer in al-Masjid al-Nabawi is equivalent to one thousand prayers
      elsewhere, so one prayer in al-Masjid al-Aqsaa is equivalent to two
      hundred and fifty prayers elsewhere. 
With regard to
      the famous hadeeth which says that prayer in al-Masjid al-Aqsaa is
      equivalent to five hundred prayers elsewhere, this is da’eef (weak).
      (See Tamaam al-Minnah [?] by Shaykh al-Albaani – may Allaah havemercy on him – p. 292).
-The one-eyed
        Dajjaal (“Antichrist”) will not enter it, because of the hadeeth,
        “He will prevail over all the earth, apart from al-Haram [in Makkah]
        and Bayt al-Maqdis.” (Narrated by Ahmad, 19665. Classed as saheeh by
        Ibn Khuzaymah, 2/327, and Ibn Hibbaan, 7/102).
-The Dajjaal will be
      killed close to al-Quds. He will be killed by the Messiah ‘Eesa ibn
      Maryam (peace be upon him), as was stated in the hadeeth: “The son of
      Maryam will kill the Dajjaal at the gates of Ludd.” (Narrated by Muslim,
      2937, from the hadeeth of al-Nawwaas ibn Sam’aan). Ludd (Lod) is a place
      near Bayt al-Maqdis.
-The Messenger 
      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was taken to Bayt al-Maqdis on
      his Night Journey (al-Israa’) from al-Masjid al-Haraam to
      al-Masjid al-Aqsaa. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Glorified
      (and Exalted) be He (Allaah) Who took His slave (Muhammad) for a journey
      by night from Al-Masjid Al-Haraam (at Makkah) to
      Al-Masjid Al-Aqsaa (in Jerusalem)…” [al-Israa’ 17:1].
      
-It (al-Quds) was the
      first qiblah of the Muslims, as was reported by al-Baraa’ (may Allaah be
      pleased with him): the Messenger of Allaah 
      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) prayed in the direction of
      Bayt al-Maqdis for sixteen or seventeen months. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari,
      41 – this version was narrated by him – and by Muslim, 525).
-It is the place
      where Wahy (Revelation) came down, and it is the homeland of the
      Prophets. This is well known.
-It is one of the
      mosques to which people may travel.
 Abu
      Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet 
      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No journey should be
      made except to three mosques, al-Masjid al-Haraam, Masjid al-Rasool 
      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and Masjid al-Aqsaa.”
      (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1132. Also narrated by Muslim, 827, from the
      hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri, with the words, “Do not travel except
      to…”).
-The Messenger 
      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) led the Prophets in one prayer
      in al-Aqsaa, as reported in the lengthyhadeeth: “… Then the time for prayer came, and I led them
      in prayer.” (Narrated by Muslim, 172, from the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah).
It is not
      permissible to travel to any spot on earth for the purpose of worshipping
      there, except these three mosques.
Secondly:
The fact that
      Ya’qoob (peace be upon him) built al-Masjid al-Aqsaa does not mean that
      the Jews have more right to the mosque than the Muslims, because Ya’qoob
      was a monotheist and the Jews are mushrikeen. The fact that their father
      Ya’qoob built the mosque does not mean that it belongs to them. He built
      it for the monotheists to worship in it, even if they were not his
      children, and he did not allow the mushrikeen to enter it, even if they
      are his children, because the call of the Prophets has nothing to do with
      race; it is based on taqwaa (piety, awareness of Allaah).
Thirdly:
Your saying
      that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)
      led the previous Prophets in prayer to signify the unity of the message
      and all divine revelations is correct from the point of view of the origin
      of the religion and ‘aqeedah (belief) of the Prophets. All of the
      Prophets received their Message from one source, which was the Wahy
      (Revelation), and they all had the same ‘aqeedah, which was the belief
      in Tawheed (absolute unity of Allaah) and the worship of Allaah Alone,
      even though there were differences in the details of their laws. This was
      confirmed by our Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)
      when he said: “I am the closest of mankind to ‘Eesaa ibn Maryam in
      this world and in the Hereafter. The Prophets are brothers although they
      have different mothers, and their religion is one.” (Narrated
      by al-Bukhaari, 3259; Muslim, 2365).

      The phrase “brothers although they have different mothers” means
      brothers who have the same father but different mothers, i.e., they are
      the children of co-wives.
      Here we would
      caution readers against believing that the Jews, Christians and Muslims
      are following the same principles nowadays, because the Jews have changed
      the religion of their Prophet. Indeed, part of the religion of their
      Prophet is that they should follow our Prophet and not reject him, but
      they disbelieve in the Prophethood of Muhammad 
 (peace and
      blessings of Allaah be upon him) and associate others in worship with
      Allaah.
Fourthly:
The Jews do not have any stake in al-Quds, because even
      though they may have lived in the land previously, that land now belongs
      to the Muslims from two points of view:
1.The Jews disbelieved and are no longer following the religion of
      the believers among the Children of Israel who followed and supported
      Moosa and ‘Eesaa (peace be upon them).
2.We Muslims have more right to it than them, because land
      does not belong to the people who lived there first, but to those who
      establish the laws of Allaah therein. Allaah created the land, and He
      created people to worship Allaah in the land and to establish therein the
      religion, laws and rulings of Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of the
      meaning): “… Verily, the
      earth is Allaah’s. He gives it as a heritage to whom He wills of His
      slaves; and the (blessed) end is for the Muttaqoon (the pious).”
      [al-A’raaf 7:128]
Hence if some
      Arabs came who were not followers of Islam and they ruled the land with
      kufr, they would have to be fought until they submitted to the rule of
      Islam or were killed.
It is not the
      matter of race or ethnicity; it is the matter of Tawheed and Islam.
Here it is
      useful to quote the words of one of the researchers:
“History
      tells us that the first people to settle in Palestine were the Canaanites,
      six thousand years BCE. They were an Arab tribe who came to Palestine from
      the Arabian Peninsula, and after their arrival, Palestine was named after
      them [i.e., Canaan].”
(al-Suhyooniyyah,
      Nash’atuhaa, Tanzeemaatuhaa, Inshitatuhaa, by Ahmad al-‘Awadi, p.
      7).
“As for the
      Jews, the first time they entered Palestine was approximately six hundred
      years after Ibraheem had entered the land, i.e., they entered it
      approximately 1400 years BCE. So the Canaanites entered Palestine and
      lived there approximately 4500 years before the Jews.”
(Ibid., p. 8)
Hence it is
      clear that the Jews have no right to the land, whether according to
      religious law or in terms of who lived there first and possessed the land.
      They are aggressors who are seizing the land by force. We ask Allaah to
      rid Bayt al-Maqdis of them sooner rather than later, for He is Able to do
      that and He is Most Generous in answering. Praise be to Allaah, the Lord
      of the Worlds.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

What are the bad consequences of such an action, on a personal level and in general, if there are any?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    No, this is not considered to be a sin, because Islamic says 
    that personal conviction has its role to play in marriage. (A woman may not 
    like a man because of something in his appearance, and she is not sinning if 
    she refuses his offer of marriage), but if you fear that you may miss the 
    boat or that you may not receive a similar offer, then put your feelings 
    aside, use your common sense and hasten to get married. 

    From the answer of Shaykh Ibraaheem al-Khudayri. 

    If a woman follows her whims and desires by rejecting a man 
    who is religiously-committed and has a good attitude, she may be punished by 
    remaining a spinster (i.e., unmarried).

When should we say “La hawla wa la quwwata illa Billah”?","Praise be to Allah.The meaning of La hawla wa la quwwata illa Billah
The meaning of this phrase, La hawla wa la quwwata illa Billah, there is no power and no strength except with Allah, is a person’s admission that he is unable to do anything without the help and support of Allah. No matter how great his power, energy and strength may become, a person still cannot do anything without the help of Allaah Who is Above all of His creation, the Most Great, compared to Whom nothing else is great. Every strong person is weak when compared with Allah. Every great person is insignificant and weak when compared with His Might.
When should we say “La hawla wa la quwwata illa Billah”? 
This sentence is uttered when some serious matter befalls a person that he cannot cope with, or there is something that is very difficult for him to deal with. (Shaykh Sa’d al-Humayd)
Among the occasions on which this phrase is uttered are the following: 

When turning over at night: 

‘Ubadah ibn al-Samit said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Whoever turns over at night and says La ilaha ill-Allah wahdahu la shareeka lah, lahu’l-mulk wa lahu’l-hamd wa huwa ‘ala kulli shay’in qadeer. Al-hamdu-lillah wa subhaan-Allah wa la ilaha ill-Allah wa Allahu akbar, wa La hawla wa la quwwata illa Billah (There is no god but Allah Alone, with no partner or associate. To Him belongs praise and His is the sovereignty, and He is able to do all things. Praise be to Allah, glory be to Allah, there is no god but Allah and Allah is Most Great. There is no power and no strength except with Allah), then he says, Allahumma ighfir li (O Allah, forgive me), or he makes du’a, his prayer will be granted. If he does wudu and prays, his salah will be accepted.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1086) 

When the muadhdhin says “Hayya ‘ala’s-salaah (come to prayer)” or “Hayya ‘ala’l-falah (come to success)” 

Hafs ibn ‘Asim ibn ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab narrated from his father that his grandfather ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘When the muadhdhinin says “Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar (Allah is Most Great),” and one of you says, “Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar”; then he says, “Ashhadu an la ilaha illa Allah (I bear witness that there is no god except Allah” and you say “Ashhadu an la ilaha illa Allah”; then he says, “Ashhadu anna Muhammadan Rasool Allah (I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah” and you say, “Ashhadu anna Muhammadan Rasool Allah”; then he says, “Hayya ‘ala’s-salah (come to prayer)” and you say, “La hawla wa la quwwata illa Billah”; then he says, “Hayya ‘ala’l-falah (come to success)” and you say, “La hawla wa la quwwata illa Billah”; then he says “Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar,” and you say, “Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar”; then he says “La ilaha illa Allah” and you say, “La ilaha illa Allah” – if he says that from the heart, he will enter Paradise.’” (Narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh, 578, and by Abu Dawood in his Sunan, 443)

When leaving one's house 

Anas ibn Malik said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Whoever says – i.e., when he is leaving his house – “Bismillah, tawwakaltu ‘ala Allah, La hawla wa la quwwata illa Billah (In the name of Allah, I put my trust in Allah, and there is no power and no strength except with Allah),” it will be said to him, “You are taken care of and protected,” and the Shaytan will leave him alone.’” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi in his Sunan, 3348. Abu ‘Isa said, this is a hasan saheeh ghareeb hadeeth which we only know through this isnad. See Saheeh al-Jami’ by al-Albani, 6419. It was also narrated by Abu Dawood in his Sunan (4431), where he adds: “And another shaytan says to him, ‘What can you do with a man who has been guided, taken care of and protected?’”) 

After praying 

Abu’l-Zubayr said: “Ibn al-Zubayr used to say immediately after every prayer, when he had said the salaam, ‘La ilaha ill-Allah wahdahu laa shareeka lah, lahu’l-mulk wa lahu’l-hamd wa huwa ‘ala kulli shay’in qadeer. La hawla wa la quwwata illa Billah wa la na’budu illa iyyah. Lahu’l-ni’mah wa lahu’l-fadl wa lahu’l-thana’ al-hasan. La ilaha ill-Allah mukhliseena lahu’l-deena wa law kariha’l-kaafiroon (There is no god but Allah Alone, with no partner or associate His is the sovereignty and to Him be praise, and He is able to do all things. There is no power and no strength except with Allah, and we worship none but Him.From Him (alone) come all blessings and favours, and all good praise is due to Him. There is no god but Allah and we make our worship purely for Him (alone) however much the disbelievers may hate that).’ He said: ‘The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say these words immediately after every prayer.’” (Narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh, 935)

7750,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7750,She hits her husband when they argue to make him end the argument,"A woman loves her husband very much, but sometimes she feels that he does not care for her at all. When they have an arguement she feels very frustrated and wants him to show her some love and end the arguement but he continues to shout at her in an uncaring way, making her feel as if he hates her. Sometimes this leads her to hit him, even though she really wants him to take her in his arms and finish it all. Unfortunately he does not understand this and hits her back, and then when she reminds him of the hadiths about kind treatment of women he talks about 'an eye for an eye', as if she is just any person, not his wife, whom he should be patient with and care and love. Could you please comment on the situation?",,,"Praise be to Allah.For a wife to hit her husband goes against the sharee’ah 
          and is neglect of her duties towards him. Why do you want him to take 
          the initiative? What you must do is strive to reduce the opportunities 
          for conflict. Instead of asking him to treat you nicely, it is more

If they do then what would be the consequences of that?  What does Islam says about going out before marriage?,,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for a man to be alone with a woman who is not his mahram, because that affords temptation to do immoral and evil actions. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No man is alone with a (non-mahram) woman but the Shaytaan is the third one present.” It is permitted to look at her when one has the intention of marriage, without being alone with her and in the presence of her father, brother, mother, etc., and looking at that which ordinarily appears of her, such as her face, hair, hands and feet. This is what is indicated by the Sunnah, so long as one is also free from the risk of fitnah (temptation).",Shaykh Waleed al-Firyaan

      it is decreed that you should be a soldier fighting in the army against

7776,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7776,Does Yellow Discharge Break Wudu?,"If yellow discharge from a woman gets on her underwear, should she wash it off, or can she just leave it and make prayer?",Everything that comes out of a woman is impure apart from the maniy. Every other substance that comes out of the two passages is impure and breaks wudu.,,"Praise be to Allah.If what is meant by the yellow discharge is the maniy (sexual discharge) because it tends to be a yellowish colour in women, then there is a difference of opinion among the scholars as to whether it is pure or not. The more correct view is that it is pure, because of the hadith narrated by Muslim which states that a man stayed the night as a guest at the house of `Aishah, and in the morning he washed his garment. `Aishah said: “It is sufficient, if you can see it, to wash the place where it is, and if you cannot see it, just sprinkle water over it. There was a time when I used to rub the garment of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), then he would pray in it.” (Muslim, no. 288)
Al-Nawawi said in Sharh Muslim (3/198):
“Many scholars said that maniy is pure . This was narrated from ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib, Sa’d ibn Abi Waqqas, Ibn ‘Umar, ‘Aishah, Dawud and Ahmad in the more correct of his two views; it is the madhhab of al-Shafi`'i and the scholars of hadith…” (Fath al-Bari, 2/332)
In Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah li’l-Buhuth (5/381) it says: 
“The emission of maniy due to an erotic dream and so on does not make the clothes worn by the person impure even if it gets on them, because maniy is pure. But what is prescribed is to remove whatever gets onto the clothes for the sake of cleanliness and removing dirt.
But if what is meant is the yellow discharge that comes during menstruation and sometimes afterwards, as narrated in the hadith of Umm ‘Atiyah – “We used not to count the yellowish and brownish discharge as anything” (Al-Nasai, 368) – this is one of the things concerning which there is no dispute that it is impure. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said in al-Fatawa (1/291):
“What is known among the scholars is that everything that comes out of a woman is impure apart from one thing, which is the maniy. The maniy is pure; apart from that every other substance that comes out of the two passages is impure and breaks wudu. On this basis, everything that comes out of a woman is impure and necessitates wudu. This is the conclusion reached following discussions with some of the scholars and consulting references. But I am still not entirely sure, because some women have this moisture all the time, and if it is continuous, then the solution is to do the same as one who suffers from urinary incontinence: she should do wudu for each prayer when the time for it begins, and do that prayer. I also spoke with some doctors and it became clear to me that if this discharge comes from the bladder, it is as we have said; and if it is from the vagina, it is as we have said, she should do wudu, but it is pure and the things it gets onto do not have to be washed.”
