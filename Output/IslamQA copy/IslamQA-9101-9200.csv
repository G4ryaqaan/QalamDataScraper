9104,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9104,Conditions of Accepting the Shahadah,"My question deals with a topic I heard in a khutbah. The Imam spoke about our kalimah. And he said it has conditions, that the ‘ulama have given 9 or so, that you must have in order to gain access to Jannah. He said just saying the words would not be enough. I wanted to know what those conditions were. He gave a few that I can remember. The first being knowledge of the Kalimah. The second being yaqin. I would like to know if you know of this, and if I could be given the rest. Any help you may be able to provide would be appreciated in sha Allah","The conditions of accepting the shahadah are: knowledge, certainty, acceptance, submission, truthfulness, sincerity, and love.","Conditions of accepting the Shahadah


Knowledge


Certainty


Acceptance


Submission


Truthfulness, true belief


Sincerity


Love","Praise be to Allah.Conditions of accepting the Shahadah
It seems that by “kalimah” you mean the Kalimat al-Tawhid (lit. Word of Divine Unity), which is the Shahadah , “La ilaha ill-Allah Muhammadun Rasul-Allah (There is no god except Allah, and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah).” This is also what the khatib was referring to.
There are a number of conditions attached to the Shahadah, which are as follows:
Knowledge
This means knowing the meaning of the Shahadah, both the negation (There is no god) and the affirmation (except Allah), knowledge as opposed to ignorance of this.
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“So know (O Muhammad) that La ilaha ill -Allah (none has the right to be worshipped but Allah)…” [Muhammad 47:19]
“except for those who bear witness to the truth knowingly [i.e., that there is no god except Allah, and they know” [al-Zukhruf 43:86] – they know in their hearts the meanings of the words that their mouths speak.
It is reported in al-Sahih that ‘Uthman ibn ‘Affan (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever dies knowing that there is no god except Allah will enter Paradise.”
Certainty
This is certainty as opposed to doubt, whereby the person who says this [the Shahadah] is absolutely certain about the meaning of these words, because faith does not count unless it is based on certain knowledge, not on knowledge based on speculation, let alone doubt.
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Only those are the believers who have believed in Allah and His Messenger, and afterward doubt not but strive with their wealth and their lives for the Cause of Allah. Those! They are the truthful.” [al-Hujurat 49:15]
A condition of their being truthful in their belief in Allah and His Messenger is that they should not doubt. The one who doubts is a hypocrite – Allah forbid.
It is reported in al-Sahih that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Bear witness that there is no god except Allah and that I am the Messenger of Allah, for no person meets Allah with these two (words), not doubting in them, and is kept away from Paradise.”
Acceptance
This means that one accepts with one’s heart and with one’s words that which is implied by this kalimah. Allah says concerning the one who accepts it (interpretation of the meaning):
“Save the chosen slaves of Allah (i.e. the true believers of Islamic Monotheism). For them there will be a known provision (in Paradise), Fruits; and they shall be honoured,
In the Gardens of Delight (Paradise)…” [al-Saffat 37:40-43]
“Whoever brings a good deed (i.e. belief in the Oneness of Allah along with every deed of righteousness), will have better than its worth; and they will be safe from the terror on that Day.” [al-Naml 27:89]
It was narrated in al-Sahih from Abu Musa (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:
“The likeness of the guidance and knowledge with which Allah has sent me is a great deal of rain which falls on the land. Some of the land is fertile: it absorbs the water and brings forth a lot of grass and vegetation. Other parts of the land are infertile, but they hold the water and Allah benefits the people thereby, so that they drink it, and water their animals and irrigate their lands with it. A third part of the land is plains which do not hold the water and where no plants grow. This is like the person who understands the religion of Allah and benefits from the Message with which Allah sent me, so he learns and teaches others (what he has learned), and the person who does not pay attention or accept the guidance of Allah with which I was sent.”
Submission
This means submitting to what is implied by the Shahadah , as opposed to ignoring or neglecting it.
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And turn in repentance and in obedience with true Faith (Islamic Monotheism) to your Lord and submit to Him (in Islam).” [al-Zumar 39:54]
“And who can be better in religion than one who submits his face (himself) to Allah (i.e. follows Allah’s religion of Islamic Monotheism); and he is a Muhsin (a good-doer.” [al-Nisa 4:125]
“And whosoever submits his face (himself) to Allah, while he is a Muhsin (good-doer, i.e. performs good deeds totally for Allah’s sake without any show-off or to gain praise or fame and does them in accordance with the Sunnah of Allah’s Messenger Muhammad), then he has grasped the most trustworthy handhold [La ilaha ill-Allah (none has the right to be worshipped but Allah)]. And to Allah return all matters for decision.” [Luqman 31:22]
“submits his face” means, he submits fully. “While he is a muhsin (good-doer)” means he affirms the Unity of Allah.
Truthfulness, true belief
This means, meaning what you say, as opposed to lying. This means saying it from the heart , where the heart agrees with the words being uttered.
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Alif Lam Mim. [These letters are one of the miracles of the Quran, and none but Allah (Alone) knows their meanings.] Do people think that they will be left alone because they say: ‘We believe,’ and will not be tested. And We indeed tested those who were before them. And Allah will certainly make (it) known (the truth of) those who are true, and will certainly make (it) known (the falsehood of) those who are liars, (although Allah knows all that before putting them to test)…” [al-'Ankabut 29:1-3]
In al-Sahihayn, it was narrated from Mu'adh ibn Jabal (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:
“There is no one who bears witness that there is no god except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, truly from his heart, but Allah will protect him from the Fire.”
Sincerity
This means purity of action with a sound intention, free from any contamination of shirk. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Surely, the religion (i.e. the worship and the obedience) is for Allah only.” [al-Zumar 39:3]
“And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allah, and worship none but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him)…” [al-Bayyinah98:5]
In al-Sahih, it is narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The people who will be most deserving of my intercession will be those who say La ilaha ill-Allah sincerely from their hearts or their souls.”
Love
This means love for this word and for what it implies, and its people, those who act upon it and adhere to its conditions; and hatred of whatever goes against it.
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And of mankind are some who take (for worship) others besides Allah as rivals (to Allah). They love them as they love Allah. But those who believe, love Allah more (than anything else).” [al-Baqarah 2:165]
The sign that a person loves his Lord is that he gives priority to what Allah loves even if it goes against his own desires, and he hates what Allah hates, even if it is something to which he is inclined. He takes as friends those who are friends of Allah and His Messenger and he takes as enemies those who are the enemies of Allah and His Messenger. He follows His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), follows in his footsteps and accepts his guidance .All of these signs are conditions of this love, and it cannot be imagined that this love can exist without any of these conditions.
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:
“There are three things which if a person finds them, he has found the sweetness of faith: when Allah and His Messenger are dearer to him than all else; when he loves a person for no other reason than for the sake of Allah; and when he hates to return to kufr after Allah has saved him from it as he would hate to be thrown into fire.” (Narrated from the hadith of Anas ibn Malik)
Some scholars added an eighth condition, which is the rejection of all things that are worshipped instead of Allah (al-kufr bi’l-taghut or rejection of false gods). 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever says La ilaha ill-Allah and rejects everything that is worshipped instead of Allah, his property and his blood will be sacred [i.e., it is forbidden to seize his property or shed his blood] and his reckoning will be with Allah.” (Narrated by Muslim)
In order for his property and his blood to be protected, he must, in addition to saying La ilaha ill-Allah, also reject whatever is worshipped instead of Allah, no matter who or what it is.

9105,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9105,Ruling on women wearing perfume,"I heard that women are not allowed to wear purfume, and that it makes them like an adulteress.  Why can men purfume, but women can't?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Wearing perfume is permissible for women if they are at home 
  or among other women. If it is done in order to please her husband, then it 
  is mustahabb, because it is part of being a good wife. But if a woman puts on 
  perfume and goes out with the purpose of letting non-mahram men smell it, then 
  it becomes haraam, and she is a sinner if she does that, because that involves 
  causing fitnah (temptation) to men. If a man puts on perfume and goes out, that 
  does not cause any fitnah, unlike the case of a woman who goes out wearing perfume. 
  If we assume that a man may cause fitnah if he goes out wearing perfume, as 
  may be the case if he is beardless and handsome, such that he may even cause 
  fitnah to men, then in this case he has to avoid things that may lead to fitnah, 
  including wearing adornments and perfumes. And Allaah is the Source of strength.

      a Muslim cannot inherit from a kaafir, and diyah is a kind of inheritance.

9117,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9117,Is epilepsy caused by the jinn?,"Since epilepsy is caused by jinn, how do we explain the black woman who came to the Prophet (saaws) asking for him to invoke Allah for her cure of her illness of epilepsy and coming uncovered, but there was no mention of jinn possession?  Or is there a mistake in translation and it wasn't really epilepsy?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Epilepsy in most cases is caused by the jinn, and in some 
    cases by some defect in the body, brain or nerves, or mood swings, or some 
    weakness in the physical structure. All of these may cause loss of 
    consciousness or unbalanced behaviour. The black woman’s epilepsy may have 
    been caused by the jinn, but there was no need to mention the cause, which 
    is why the narrators only mentioned what needs to be done when epilepsy 
    occurs, for whatever reason, of making du’aa’ and performing ruqyah, or 
    bearing it with patience and seeking the reward from Allaah.

     Shaykh ‘Abd al-Kareem al-Khudayr

     The hadeeth about the black woman is narrated in Saheeh 
    al-Bukhaari (5652) and Saheeh Muslim (2576). In some versions of 
    the hadeeth there is an indication that her epilepsy was caused by the jinn. 
    For example, in a version narrated by al-Bazzaar, she said, “I am afraid 
    that the evil one may cause me to become uncovered.” Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar 
    said: “It may be understood from some of the different versions of the 
    hadeeth that what Umm Zafar was suffering from was the kind of epilepsy 
    caused by the jinn and not that which results from dysfunction in the 
    brain.”

Is this halaal or haraam?,,,"Praise be to Allah.In Arabic this is called washm 
          (lit. tattooing). This was forbidden by the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and he cursed those who 
          did it. It was narrated in a saheeh report that he  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that he cursed the one who 
          consumes riba (interest) and the one who pays it, and he cursed 
          the one who does tattoos and the one who asks to be tattooed. There 
          is no difference between tattoos on the face or on the hand or elsewhere. 
          With regard to what has been done in the past as a result of ignorance, 
          it is sufficient to repent for that, and praise be to Allaah. If it 
          is possible to remove it without causing harm, then that must be done. 
          With regard to the future, after coming to know the ruling of Allaah,

Would that need to be in father's name or the other person's name.,,,"Praise be to Allah.If a Muslim dies after he has become able to perform Hajj, then his heir has to do Hajj on his behalf himself, or he can delegate someone else to do Hajj for him, paid for from the money of the deceased, because this is a debt that he owes that is more deserving of being paid off. The delegate need not be one of the deceased person’s relatives. The sacrifice (qurbaan) which is done at the time of Hajj should be done in the name of the deceased father, not the name of the delegated person, if it is one of the requirements of Hajj.

          depends on the situation of the husband; it may be that marriage to 
          a widow is more suitable for him, and better.  
The 
          widow may be a lady of religious commitment and good character, such 
          that you would not want to let the opportunity to marry such a woman 
          “slip through your fingers”, and you could not find a virgin of such 
          religious commitment and character.  
But 
          generally speaking, the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) encouraged marriage to virgins.  
          
There 
          is the story of Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him), whose father 
          had died, leaving him with sisters. In his case it would not have been 
          suitable for him to marry a virgin who was young like them. So he wanted 
          to marry a woman who had been previously married, who could take care 
          of them and look after them, and the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) approved of his decision.  
          
It was narrated that Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah 
          (may Allaah be pleased with them both) said: “The Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) asked me, ‘Have you got 
          married?’ I said, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘A virgin or a previously-married 
          woman?’ I said, ‘A previously-married woman.’ He said, ‘Why not a young 
          girl, whom you could play with and she could play with you?’ I said, 
          ‘I have sisters and I wanted to marry a woman who could gather them 
          together and comb their hair and take care of them.’ He said: ‘You will 
          reach, so when you have arrived (at home), I advise you to associate 
          with your wife (that you may have an intelligent son).’”
(Narrated 
          by al-Bukhaari, 1991; Muslim, 715)  
According 
          to another report narrated by al-Bukhaari (2257), “… so she could teach 
          them and discipline them.”  
According 
          to another report narrated by al-Bukhaari (2805) and Muslim (715): “He 
          said: ‘The Messenger of Allaah  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to me, when I asked 
          his permission (to participate in jihaad), “Have you married 
          a virgin or a previously-married woman?” I said, “A previously-married 
          woman.” He said, “Why did you not marry a virgin whom you could play 
          with and she could play with you?” I said, “O Messenger of Allaah, my 
          father has died (or has become a shaheed/martyr), and I have 
          young sisters, so I did not want to marry someone like them who could 
          not discipline them or take care of them, so I married a previously-married 
          woman who could take care of them and discipline them.”’”  
It was narrated that Jaabir (may Allaah be 
          pleased with him) said: “My father died, leaving seven – or nine – daughters, 
          and I married a previously-married woman. The Messenger of Allaah  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) asked, ‘Did you get married, 
          O Jaabir?’ I said, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘A virgin or a previously-married 
          woman?’ I said, ‘A previously-married woman.’ He said, ‘Why not a young 
          girl whom you could play with and she could play with you, and you could 
          laugh with her and she could laugh with you?’ I told him that ‘Abd-Allaah 
          had died and left behind daughters, and I did not want to bring to them 
          someone like them. So I had married a woman who could take care of them 
          and discipline them. He said, ‘May Allaah bless you,’ or similar kind 
          words.”(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5052)  
Shaykh 
          Mustafa al-Ruhaybaani said: 
“It is 
          Sunnah for the one who wants to get married to marry a virgin, because 
          the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
          of Allaah be upon him) said to Jaabir, ‘Why not a virgin whom you could

          is a reason for which marrying a previously-married woman is better,

          wife observe proper hijaab as prescribed in sharee’ah and cover her 
          face. The evidence of the Qur’aan and Sunnah indicates that it is obligatory 
          for women to cover their faces, for example, the aayah in which Allaah 
          says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and 
          the women of the believers to draw their cloaks (veils) all over their 
          bodies…” 
[al-Ahzaab 33:59] 
The jilbaab (translated here as “cloak”) is a garment 
          which a woman places on her head and lets it drop over her face. 
And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
          
“and not to reveal their adornment except to their 
          husbands…” [al-Noor 24:31] 
The focal point of beauty and adornment is the face, 
          so it is ‘awrah. So he [the husband] should fear Allaah and not obey 
          his parents in this matter. He should make his wife observe proper hijaab, 
          for there is no obedience to any created being if it involves disobedience 
          to the Creator, as it says in the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be 
          pleased with him), who said: “The Messenger of Allaah  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘To hear and obey 
          is a duty unless there comes an order to commit sin. If there comes 
          an order to commit sin, then there is no hearing and no obeying.” (narrated 
          by al-Bukhaari, al-Jihaad wa’l-Siyar, 2735).  How can he 
          anger his Lord by pleasing his parents? Let him fear Allaah and remember 
          that the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
          of Allaah be upon him) has made him responsible for his family, when 
          he said, “Every man is in charge of his family and is responsible for 
          those who are under his care.” (narrated by al-Bukhaari in al-Jumu’ah, 
          844). So praise Allaah for giving you a wife who is content to observe

9182,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9182,Ruling      on praying behind someone who is praying alone,"If a Muslim starts to pray on his own, then another person comes along, is it OK for him to join the first person in his prayer, or should he keep away from him because he started his prayer alone?",,,"Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with that according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions. There is a difference of opinion on the matter, but the correct view is that it is permitted, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stood to pray on his own one night, and Ibn ‘Abbaas came and prayed with him. In this case, the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) became the imaam and Ibn ‘Abbaas became the one who was following him in prayer. So the intention of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) changed from the intention to pray alone to the intention to lead the prayer. This indicates that it is permissible. This applies equally to naafil prayers and to fard prayers, except in cases where the evidence specifies something to the contrary. This view is more correct than the other view, and it is also the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah. It was also narrated from Imaam Ahmad. This is the more correct view, in sha Allah.","Fataawa Samaahat al-Imaam ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Humayd, p. 93"
9197,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9197,"Is there any difference between Sunnah, mustahabb and nafil?",What is the difference between Sunnah and Nafel? and Sunnah and Musthab?,,,"Praise be to Allah.The 
          majority of scholars of Usool al-Fiqh say that there is no difference 
          between Sunnah, mustahabb, tatawwu’ (voluntary actions) and nafil. But 
          the Hanafis say something different. They regard mandoob (recommended) 
          as being of the same status as nafil, and they differentiate between 
          Sunnah and nafil, regarding Sunnah as being higher in status.","Sharh al-Waraqaat fi Usool al-Fiqh by Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah al-Fawzaan, 26  ."
