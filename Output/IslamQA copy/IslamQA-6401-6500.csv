Besides this many other unislamic practices are also done, for instance all food stuff is not halaal with the result these same utensils are used to prepare food for me i am  under the impression that this is not permissible. Now I am considering leaving home since this is not something i am in favour of. Also I intend to  leave country some time in future (IN-SHA ALLAH) because i cannot go for namaaz as regularly as i must.

In short i want to live as a Muslim but as I live in a westernized country it is difficult to live as a Muslim should.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    If your mother is a Christian then you have to call her to 
    Islam with wisdom and beautiful preaching. Tell her about the beauties of 
    Islam and its characteristics and beliefs. Explain to her the falseness of 
    the Christian belief in the divinity of Jesus (peace be upon him). You can 
    also refer to the questions in the 
    Da’wah to Non-Muslims 
    section of this website, so that you can convince her, as well as reading 
    some books which speak of the falseness of Christian doctrines.  

    But if your mother is a Muslim, then you have to call her to 
    give up sin and to repent from it, especially drinking alcohol. Tell her the 
    evidence from the Qur’aan and Sunnah which proves that it is haraam, and 
    that when a command comes from Allaah or His Messenger  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him), the believer has to hear and obey, and 
    hasten to follow the command even if that is contrary to his own whims and 
    desires. 

    Make her fear Allaah and His punishment in this world and in 
    the Hereafter. 

    You have to be gentle and kind to her, tell her that you are 
    eager that she should be guided and saved from Hell. 

    Perhaps this will be the means of guiding her to the truth. 

    With regard to the cooking utensils with which haraam foods 
    are cooked, if there are others available then it is preferable for you to 
    eat from those. But if no others are available, then you can wash them with 
    water and then eat from them. 

    It was narrated that Abu Tha’labah al-Khushani (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) said: “I said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, I live in the land 
    of the People of the Book. Please advise me with regard to their vessels.’ 
    He said, ‘Do not eat from them, unless you cannot find anything else, in 
    which case wash them and eat from them.’” (Agreed upon. Buloogh al-Maraam, 
    p. 23, hadeeth no. 24). 

    With regard to your thinking of leaving home or leaving your 
    country, that may be better if you know that your family will not respond to 
    your words and if staying with them will damage your religious commitment in 
    such a way that you cannot do what Allaah commands.  

    But if you know or you think it most likely that after you 
    call them to Allaah they will respond, then you must stay with them. 

    Imam al-Bukhaari included a chapter in his Saheeh entitled: 
    Baab al-Inbisaat ila’l-Naas (Chapter on being friendly towards people). Ibn 
    Mas’ood said: “Mix with people but beware of damaging your religious 
    commitment.”

    (Saheeh al-Bukhaari, 5/2270).  

    But if you know from your experience with your family that 
    this will be futile, then leave them and go and live in a place where you 
    can practice the rituals of Islam. 

    We ask Allaah to make you steadfast in your religious 
    commitment and to keep you safe. We ask Him to guide your mother and all 
    your family to His religion so that the religion of Allaah will be the 
    dearest thing to you all.

Is it permissible to recite and also please explain in detail if there is any shirk associated in the meaning of Salawaat un naria.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The marriage of a Muslim woman to a kaafir, no matter what 
    his religion, is invalid according to sharee’ah and their intimacy is 
    tantamount to fornication. They must be separated, because Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And do not marry Al-Mushrikaat (idolatresses) till they 
    believe (worship Allaah Alone). And indeed a slave woman who believes is 
    better than a (free) Mushrikah (idolatress), even though she pleases you. 
    And give not (your daughters) in marriage to Al-Mushrikoon till they believe 
    (in Allaah Alone) and verily, a believing slave is better than a (free) 
    Mushrik (idolater), even though he pleases you. Those (Al-Mushrikoon) invite 
    you to the Fire, but Allaah invites (you) to Paradise and forgiveness by His 
    Leave”

    [al-Baqarah 2:221]

    And Allaah says, stating that the Muslim women are not 
    permissible in marriage for kaafir men (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “They are not lawful (wives) for the disbelievers nor are 
    the disbelievers lawful (husbands) for them”

    [al-Mumtahanah 60:10]

    Al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his book 
    al-Jaami’ li Ahkaam al-Qur’aan (3/72): The ummah is unanimously agreed 
    that a kaafir man cannot marry a Muslim woman at all because that undermines 
    the position of Islam. 

    But if the man becomes a Muslim – as mentioned in the 
    question – then he must re-marry the woman with a new marriage contract, 
    because the first marriage contract was invalid and does not count for 
    anything in sharee’ah. 

    Shaykh ‘Atiyah Muhammad Saalim said in his completion of the 
    book Adwa’ al-Bayaan, 8/164-165: 

    Why is it permissible for a Muslim man to marry a kaafir 
    woman from among the People of the Book (i.e., Jews and Christians), but it 
    is not permissible for a Muslim woman to marry a kaafir man from among the 
    People of the Book?  

    This question may be answered from two angles: 

    1 – That Islam should prevail and not be prevailed over. The 
    role of maintainer and protector in marriage belongs exclusively to the 
    husband, so the man may influence his wife and she may not be able to 
    practice her religion as she should, and she may leave her religion 
    altogether. Similarly the children will follow the religion of their 
    father. 

    2 – Islam is comprehensive and other religions are limited, 
    on which there is based a social matter that affects family life and the 
    relationship between the spouses. This means is that if a Muslim man marries 
    a Jewish or Christian woman, he believes in her Book and her Prophet, so he 
    will deal with her on a basis of respect for her religion because he 
    believes in it in general terms, and that will give them some common ground 
    which may lead to her becoming Muslim as her own Book tells her. But if a 
    Jewish or Christian man marries a Muslim woman, he does not believe in her 
    religion so he will not have any respect towards her religion or her 
    principles. There is no room for common ground with him with regard to 
    something that he does not believe in at all. So there is no room for 
    harmony or mutual understanding; there is no goodness in such a marriage, so 
    it is forbidden in the first place. 

    So they must make a new marriage contract. And Allaah knows 
    best. 

    With regard to the question about al-Salaah al-Naariyyah, 
    please see question no.

6408,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6408,Having a relaxed    attitude towards wearing Islamic dress in front of non-mahrams,What is the Islamic ruling on a woman whose attitude towards wearing Islamic dress is too relaxed and who sits with her brother in law?,,,"Praise be to Allah.The Qur’aan and Sunnah both direct women to cover themselves and avoid displaying their adornments in front of “strangers” (non-mahram men). The Qur’aan tells the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) (interpretation of the meaning):
“O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks (veils) all over their bodies (i.e. screen themselves completely except the eyes or one eye to see the way). That will be better, that they should be known (as free respectable women) so as not to be annoyed. And Allâh is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful” [al-Ahzaab 33:59].
Allaah commanded His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to start by telling his wives and daughters to wear the jilbaab (i.e., the abaayah or an outer garment), because he and his family are examples for the believing men and women, then he was to command the believing women to do likewise:
“That will be better, that they should be known (as free respectable women) so as not to be annoyed” means, if a woman wears the jilbaab, it will be known that she is a decent woman who covers herself and desires chastity, unlike the women of the Jaahiliyyah who uncovered their adornments and temptations in front of all men, so she herself would be tempted and she would tempt others, she was misled and she misled others, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) described them in the hadeeth narrated by Muslim:
“There are two types of the people of Hell whom I have not seen: men with whips like the tails of cattle with which they strike the people, and women who are clothed but naked, walking with an enticing gait, with something like the humps of camels on their heads. They will not enter Paradise nor even smell its fragrance, and its fragrance can be smelled from such and such a distance.”
The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) also warned against having too relaxed an attitude towards the matter of women mixing with men who are not her mahrams, or who are only temporarily her mahrams, like her sister’s husband or her husband’s brother and so on. He (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Beware of entering upon women.” They said, “O Messenger of Allaah, what do you think about the brother-in-law?” he said: “The brother in law is death.” I.e., many people have a relaxed attitude towards the brother-in-law entering upon women, until some disaster happens as a result, that they never thought would happen because they trusted their brother-in-law! This is neglecting reality, because no man is alone with a (non-mahram) woman but the Shaytaan is the third one present with them, and no woman is exposed to temptation but she will give in, except for those on whom Allaah has mercy. We ask Allaah to keep us all safe from that, and to help us follow His words (interpretation of the meaning):

Do you have to recite a surah in the third and fourth rak`ahs?","Praise be to Allah.Do you have to recite  a surah after al-Fatihah?
Reciting  Quran after al-Fatihah in prayer is not obligatory, either in an obligatory prayer or a supererogatory prayer, whether the prayer is one in which Quran is recited out loud or one in which it is recited silently, whether one is joining the prayer late or otherwise. 
 ‘Ata said: Abu Hurayrah said: In every prayer there is recitation.  What we heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say, we tell you, and what he did not tell us about we cannot tell you. Whoever recites Umm al-Kitab (i.e., Surat al-Fatihah) has done enough, and whoever does more than that, that is better. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 738; Muslim, 396) 
Al-Nawawi said: 
“The phrase, “Whoever recites Umm al-Kitab (i.e., Surat al-Fatihah) has done enough, and whoever does more than that, that is better” indicates that reciting al-Fatihah is obligatory , and that nothing else will do.  
It also indicates that reciting a surah after al-Fatihah is mustahabb. There is scholarly consensus on this point with regard to Fajr, Jumu`ah and the first two rak`ahs of every prayer, and this is Sunnah according to all scholars. Al-Qadi ‘Iyad (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated that some of the companions of Malik said that reciting a second surah is obligatory, but this is an odd view which is to be rejected. 
Do you have to recite a surah in the third and fourth rak`ahs?
With regard to reciting an additional surah in the third and fourth rak`ahs, there was a difference of opinion among the scholars as to whether it is mustahabb or not. Malik (may Allah have mercy on him) regarded it as makruh. Al-Shafi`i (may Allah be pleased with him) regarded it as mustahabb in his new opinion but not in his old opinion; the old opinion in this case is more correct.” (Sharh Muslim, 4/105, 106)
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“According to the majority of scholars, reciting another surah (after al-Fatihah) is Sunnah and is not obligatory, because it is obligatory to recite only al-Fatihah.” (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 3/103) 
If you stand up to complete your prayer after the imam has said the taslim, then the correct scholarly view is that the rak`ahs in which you caught up with the imam form the first part of your prayer. 
If what remains of your prayer is the third and fourth rak`ahs, then you should recite al-Fatihah only; if what remains is the second and subsequent rak`ahs, then in the second you should recite al-Fatihah plus another surah, and in the remaining rak`ahs you should recite al-Fatihah only. 
It is permissible for a worshipper to recite another surah after al-Fatihah in the third and fourth rak`ahs, but he should do that only sometimes; it was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did this according to a hadith narrated by Muslim (452).

Importance of consulting knowledgeable people


Man-woman interaction in Islam","Praise be to Allah.Applying the principle of warding off harm
It is known in the religion of Allah that it is forbidden to follow in the footsteps of the Shaytan. Everything that could lead a person to fall into haram things is also haram, even if in principle it is originally permitted. This is what the scholars call the principle of warding off harm.
Importance of consulting knowledgeable people
Concerning this matter, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“O you who believe! Follow not the footsteps of Shaytan.” [al-Nur 24:21]
With regard to the second matter, He says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And insult not those whom they (disbelievers) worship besides Allah, lest they insult Allah wrongfully without knowledge.” [al-An'am 6:108]
Here Allah forbids the believers to insult the non-Muslims lest that leads to them insulting the Lord, may He be glorified and exalted.
There are many examples of this principle in the Shari`ah. Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) mentioned many of them and explained them well in his excellent book A’lam al-Muwaqqi’in. (See 3/147-171 thereof).
Man-woman interaction in Islam
The issue of talking to the opposite sex here also comes under this category. Conversation, whether verbally or in writing, between men and women is permissible in and of itself, but it may be a way of falling into the traps of the Shaytaan.
Whoever knows that he is somewhat weak, and is afraid that he may fall into the traps of the Shaytan, has to refrain from such conversations , in order to save himself.
Conditions of online chats between men and women in Islam 
Whoever is sure that he will be able to remain steadfast, then we think that it is permissible in his case, but there are certain conditions:

The conversation should not be allowed to wander too far from the topic being discussed; or it should be for the purposes of calling others to Islam .
They should not let their voices be soft, or use soft and gentle expressions.
They should not ask about personal matters that have no bearing on the matter being discussed, such as how old a person is, how tall he or she is, or where he or she lives etc.
Other brothers (in the case of men) or sisters (in the case of women) should take part in the conversation or read the correspondence, so that the Shaytan will find no way to enter the hearts of the people who are conversing or corresponding .
The conversation or correspondence must be halted immediately if the heart starts to stir with feelings of desire.

If the hair is dyed black, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade that when he commanded a man to change his white hair, but to avoid black. He said: “Change this white hair but avoid black.” (See Saheeh Muslim, 5476). A stern warning has also been narrated to the one who does that, namely the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “There will be people at the end of time who will dye their hair black like the crops of birds; they will not even smell the fragrance of Paradise.” (Narrated by Abu Dawood, 4212; al-Nasaa’i, 8/138; classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 8153). This indicates that it is forbidden to change the hair with black dye. With regard to changing it with different colours of dye, the basic principle is that it is permissible, unless it is done in the manner of kaafir women or immoral women, in which case it is forbidden for that reason, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.” (Narrated by Abu Dawood, 4031; classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel, 5/109).","Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Rasaa’il Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 4/121"

With regard to the virtues of Soorat al-Naba’ and the reward for reading it, we do not know of anything that applies specifically to this soorah apart for what is known about the rest of the Qur’aan; there is nothing special about this soorah as it were, apart from what we know that whoever reads one letter of the Qur’aan will have one good deed is recorded for him. ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever reads one letter from the Book of Allaah will earn one good (hasanah) thereby. One good deed is equal to ten good deeds the like of it. I do not say that Alif-Lam-Mim is a letter, but Alif is a letter, Laam is a letter and Meem is a letter.’” 
Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2910; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 2327 
But it was narrated that it is one of the soorahs containing warnings that were very difficult for the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Hood, al-Waaqi’ah, al-Mursalaat, ‘Amma yatsaa’iloon [al-Naba’] and Idha al-‘shamsu kuwwirat [al-Takweer] have made my hair grey.”
(Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3297. classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani, al-Saheehah, 955) 
With regard to the virtues of Soorat al-Waaqi’ah, there is a hadeeth which speaks of its virtues, but that hadeeth is not saheeh. 
It was narrated from Shujaa’ from Abi Faatimah that ‘Uthmaan ibn ‘Affaan (may Allaah be pleased with him) visited Ibn Mas’ood when he was sick. He said, “What is hurting?” He said, “My sins.” He said, “What do you need?” He said, “The mercy of my Lord.” He said, “Shall we not call the doctor for you?” He said, “The doctor made me ill.” He said, “Shall I order that your regular income [from the state] be restored to you?” He said, “You did not let me have it before today and I have no need of it now.” He said, ‘Then leave it to your family and dependents.” He said, “I have taught them something which, if they say it, they will never become poor. I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say, ‘Whoever recites al-Waaqi’ah every night will never become poor.” 
(Narrated by al-Bayhaqi in Shu’ab al-Eemaan, 2/491. This hadeeth was classed as da’eef by Shaykh al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah, 289). 
With regard to the virtues of Soorah Ya-Seen, there are ahaadeeth concerning its virtues which are not saheeh. 
It was narrated that Anas said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Everything has a heart and the heart of the Qur’aan is Ya-Seen. Whoever recites Ya-Seen, Allaah will record for him the reward of reading the Qur’aan ten times.’” 
(Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2887. He said, It is not saheeh because of its isnaad, and its isnaad is da’eef (weak). Al-Albaani said in al-Da’eefah (169): (it is) mawdoo’ (fabricated)). 
The same applies to the hadeeth narrated from Abu Hurayrah, which says that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:  “Allaah recited Ta-Ha and Ya-Seen one thousand years before He created the heavens and the earth. When the angels heard the Qur’aan they said, ‘Glad tidings to the nation to whom this will be revealed, and glad tidings to the hearts that will bear this, and glad tidings to the tongues that will speak these words.’” 
(Narrated by al-Daarimi, 3280. al-Albaani said in al-Da’eefah (1248): (it is) munkar (a form of da’eef or weak hadeeth)). 
And the same may be said of the hadeeth narrated from Ma’qal ibn Yassaar, which says: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Recite Ya-Seen over your dead.” 
(Narrated by Abu Dawood, 3121; Ibn Maajah, 1448. Shaykh al-Albaani said: With regard to reciting Soorat Ya-Seen over the deceased and turning him to face the qiblah, there is no saheeh hadeeth to this effect. Ahkaam al-Janaa’iz, p. 11) 
And the same may be said of the hadeeth of Anas ibn Maalik according to which the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever enters the graveyard and recites Soorat Yaa-Seen, (the torment) will be reduced for them that day, and he will have hasanaat equivalent to the number of people in the graveyard.” 
Shaykh al-Albaani said in al-Da’eefah (1246): It is mawdoo’ (fabricated). It was narrated by al-Tha’labi in his Tafseer (3/161/2) 
With regard to Soorat al-Mulk, there are saheeh ahaadeeth which speak of its virtues: 
It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is a soorah of the Qur’aan containing thirty verses which have interceded for a man until he was forgiven. It is the soorah Tabaarak alladhi bi yadihi’l-mulk.” 
Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2891; Ahmad, 7634; Abu Dawood, 1400; Ibn Maajah, 3786. This hadeeth was classed as hasan by al-Tirmidhi and by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 3/6. 
Another hadeeth which speaks of its virtues was narrated from Jaabir, that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) never used to sleep until he had recited Alif-laam-meem tanzeel [al-Sajdah] and Tabaarak alladhi bi yadihi’l-mulk [al-Mulk]. 
Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2892; Ahmad, 14249. Al-Albaani said in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi (3/6) that this hadeeth is saheeh. 
Secondly: 
There is no set way to memorize Qur’aan. People vary in their ability to commit things to memory; each person has a way and a time that suits him. 
Some people like to read and memorize after Fajr prayer; some like to do so after Maghrib. So look at your own situation and do what is best for you.  
Some people find the short Makkan soorahs easier, and some find the long Madeenan soorahs easier, so start with whichever is easier for you. 
You could start with the soorahs which are often heard and are easy to memorize, such as al-Kahf and Maryam, and the later juz’ (parts) of the Qur’aan. This will give you a motive to complete your memorization, when you find that you have memorized many juz’. 
One of the most important means of consolidating what you have memorized and not forgetting it is to repeat it and go back to it all the time. Some people who have tried to memorize the Qur’aan recite it as they walk in the street and when riding buses, when going into shops and marketplaces, and in all circumstances and at all times, night and day. 
Acting upon what you have learned of the verses of Allaah is one of the best means of memorizing the Qur’aan by heart.  
It was narrated that Abu ‘Abd al-Rahmaan said: The companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) who used to teach us Qur’aan told us that they would learn ten verses, then they would not move on to the next ten verses until they had learned the knowledge contained therein and how to act upon it. They said, So we learned the knowledge and how to put it into practice. 
Ahmad, 22384 
What is well known and has been tried and tested by people is that the best way to memorize Qur’aan is to repeat it in prayers such as Sunnah and naafil prayers, etc – or in the fard prayers for the imam } – especially in Qiyaam al-Layl (naafil prayers at night). There is nothing wrong with reciting the juz’ which you are learning in naafil prayers. 
But if you forget some part of the Qur’aan when you are praying, try to remember it until you feel that you will not be able to remember it, then there is nothing wrong with moving on from the part that you cannot remember, to the following part that you can remember. When you finish you prayer, go to the Mus-haf and review the part that you had forgotten.

Can you take part in lotteries?


Can you gamble occasionally?","Praise be to Allah.Are lotteries haram?
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:  
“Are the lotteries or raffles which some charities organize to raise funds for their activities in the educational, medical or social work fields, permissible according to Shari`ah?”
 He answered:
“Lotteries and raffles are other names for gambling , which is haram according to the Quran and Sunnah, and the consensus of the scholars. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“O you who believe! Intoxicants (all kinds of alcoholic drinks), and gambling, and Al-Ansab (stone altars for sacrifices to idols, etc.), and Al-Azlam (arrows for seeking luck or decision) are an abomination of Shaytan’s (Satan’s) handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) in order that you may be successful.
Shaytan (Satan) wants only to excite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants (alcoholic drinks) and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of Allah and from As Salah (the prayer). So, will you not then abstain?” [al-Maidah 5:90-91]
 It is not permissible for the Muslims to engage in any kind of gambling at all, whether the money collected from gambling is to spend on charitable projects or otherwise, because it is evil and forbidden, as indicated by the general meaning of the evidence, and because the earnings derived from gambling are among the kinds of earnings which we must avoid and beware of. And Allah is the Source of strength.”   (Fatawa Islamiyyah, 4/442)  
Can you take part in lotteries?
Shaykh Muhammad al-Salih al-‘Uthaymin was asked: 
What is the ruling on taking part in lotteries , which means that a person buys a ticket and if he is lucky he gets a lot of money, knowing that this person intends to use that money for Islamic projects and to help the mujahidin so that they will benefit from that? 
He answered: 
“What the questioner describes, where a person buys a ticket then if he is lucky – as he says – he gets a lot of money, comes under the heading of gambling , of which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“O you who believe! Intoxicants (all kinds of alcoholic drinks), and gambling, and Al Ansab (stone altars for sacrifices to idols, etc.), and Al Azlam (arrows for seeking luck or decision) are an abomination of Shaytan’s (Satan’s) handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) in order that you may be successful.
Shaytan (Satan) wants only to excite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants (alcoholic drinks) and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of Allah and from the prayer. So, will you not then abstain?
And obey Allah and the Messenger (Muhammad), and beware (of even coming near to drinking or gambling or Al Ansab, or Al Azlam) and fear Allah. Then if you turn away, you should know that it is Our Messenger’s duty to convey (the Message) in the clearest way” [al-Maidah 5:90-91] 
This gambling – which is any transaction in which a person may win or lose, and he does not know whether he will be a winner or a loser – is all haram. Indeed, it is one of the major sins, and its abhorrent nature is no secret when one realizes that Allah mentions it in conjunction with idol-worship, alcohol and azlam (arrows for seeking luck or decision). Whatever benefits may be hoped for from gambling pale into insignificance beside the harm that it causes. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“They ask you (O Muhammad) concerning alcoholic drink and gambling. Say: ‘In them is a great sin, and (some) benefits for men, but the sin of them is greater than their benefit.’” [al-Baqarah 2:219]
Think about this verse, where benefits are mentioned in the plural, and sin is mentioned in the singular. Allah did not say, “In it are many sins and (some) benefits for men”, rather He said (interpretation of the meaning): “a great sin”. This is an indication that the benefits, no matter how numerous they may be, are insignificant when compared with this great sin; the great sin far outweighs them. So its sin is greater than its benefits, no matter what they are.  (Fatawa Islamiyyah, 4/441)
Can you gamble occasionally?
With regard to a person’s saying that he only gambles occasionally, this is like one who says that he only commits adultery occasionally, or he only steals occasionally, or he only lies occasionally. Does the fact that he commits that haram action only rarely mean that it is not a sin and that he is not exposed to the wrath of Allah? How does he know that this rare action will not develop into something that is done more frequently, until it becomes a habit? In fact this is what usually happens, especially in the case of those who are afflicted by gambling. He should fear Allah and abstain from that which Allah has forbidden to him.
 And Allah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
6485,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6485,Iblees Was Not One of the Angels,My friend told me that Iblees (shaytan) used to be an angel. My wife says that this is not true. Could you please give me some information?,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    
    Iblees was definitely not one of the angels. This is indicated by three 
    things: the clear texts of the Quran, the physical attributes of Iblees and 
    the attitude of Iblees.  

    1- 
    With regard to the clear statements of the Quran, Allah says (interpretation 
    of the meaning): 

    “And 
    (remember) when We said to the angels: ‘Prostrate yourselves unto Adam.’ So 
    they prostrated themselves except Iblees (Satan). He was one of the jinn.” 
    [18:50] 
Al-Hasan al-Basri said: Iblees was never 
    one of the angels, not even for an instant. He is the father of the jinn, 
    just as Adam (peace be upon him) is the father of mankind. 

    This 
    was narrated by al-Tabari with a saheeh isnad (authentic chain of narration) 
    as stated by Ibn Kathir in his exegesis. 

    2 – 
    With regard to his physical attributes, Allah stated that He created him 
    from fire. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “He 
    created man (Adam) from sounding clay like the clay of pottery.

    And 
    the jinn He created from a smokeless flame of fire.” [55:14, 15] 

    It 
    was narrated in Saheeh Muslim from the hadeeth (report) of ‘Aishah (may 
    Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be 
    upon him) said: “The angels were created from light, the jinn were created 
    from smokeless fire, and Adam was created from that which has been described 
    to you.” 

    So it 
    is clear that there is a difference between the physical nature of the 
    angels and that of Iblees, and he is definitely not one of them. 

    3 – 
    With regard to his attitude, Iblees disobeyed Allah by not prostrating to 
    Adam, but we know from the Quran that it is impossible for the angels to 
    disobey Allah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    
    “…angels stern (and) severe, who disobey not, (from executing) the commands 
    they receive from Allah, but do that which they are commanded.” [66:6] 
Some reports which are not saheeh 
    (authentic) have been narrated from some of the salaf (pious predecessors), 
    suggesting that Iblees was the best of the angels, that he was one of the 
    keepers of Paradise, etc. Imam Ibn Kathir commented on this by saying: 

    Many 
    reports to this effect have been narrated from the salaf, but most of them 
    come from the Israiliyyat (reports narrated from Jewish sources) which were 
    narrated to be examined. Allah knows best about the true status of many of 
    them. There are some which can be rejected out of hand because they go 
    against the truth that we have before us. In the Quran there is sufficient 
    information so that we have no need for earlier reports, because hardly any 
    of them are free from alterations, additions and subtractions, and many 
    things have been fabricated in them. The earlier nations did not have 
    scholars to examine these reports and eliminate those which are not sound, 
    as this ummah (nation) has with its imams (religious leaders) and scholars 
    who have great knowledge and are pious and righteous, who wrote down the 
    hadeeth and examined them and showed what is sound and what is not, and what 
    is fabricated, identifying the fabricators, liars and those narrators who 
    were unknown, and other categories of narrators. All of this was to protect 
    the status of the Prophet, the seal of the Prophets and the leader of 
    mankind (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), lest any lie be 
    attributed to him and lest anything be attributed to him that he did not say 
    or do. May Allah be pleased with them and make them pleased and make the 
    Paradise of al-Firdaws their abode.

        best as to their Faith, then if you ascertain that they are true believers send them not

So he could be tested by asking him about Allaah, His religion, and
      His Prophet Muhammad 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and about the religion

You could also make sure of his Islam by watching to see if he persists
      in the obligatory acts of worship, such as prayer  especially if there is a mosque
      nearby  and fasting.
If a person  especially a new Muslim  is really serious
      about Islam, this will also manifest itself in other ways, such as whether he bothers to
      ask questions about the rulings on halaal and haraam. 
He will also be concerned about changing the way he is, such as ridding
      himself of kaafir rituals and giving up things that are munkar and haraam that he used to
      do before he was Muslim.
Whether he is truly Muslim will also be seen from the way he hates the
      kufr that he used to follow before. The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
      him) said: There are three things, whoever attains them will find the sweetness of
      faith: when Allaah and His Messenger are more beloved to him than anyone else; when he
      loves a person and loves him only for the sake of Allaah; and when he would hate to return
      to kufr after Allaah has saved him from it, as he would hate to be thrown into the
      fire. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 21).
We also want to be sure that there is no forbidden relationship, because a
      Muslim woman is not permitted to do this. She should not touch or be alone with a
      non-mahram man (one to whom she is not married or related by close blood ties). We ask

Firstly: the fate of the children of the Muslims.
Secondly: the fate of the children of the kuffaar.
With regard to the first part, the fate of the children of the Muslims:
Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: With regard to the children of the believers, there is no dispute among the scholars. Al-Qaadi Abu Ya’laa ibn al-Farraa’ al-Hanbali narrated that Imaam Ahmad said: there is no dispute concerning the fact that they will be among the people of Paradise. This is what is well known among people (i.e., the majority of scholars) and this is what we are definitely sure about, in sha Allaah. (Tafseer al-Qur’aan al-‘Azeem, 3/33).
Imaam Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: who has any doubts that the children of the Muslims will be in Paradise?!
He also said: there is no difference among them on this matter. (Haashiyat Ibn al-Qayyim ‘ala Sunan Abi Dawood, 7/83).
Imaam al-Nawawi said: the reliable Muslim scholars agreed that any Muslim child who dies will be among the people of Paradise, because he was not responsible (i.e., had not yet reached the age of account). (Sharh Muslim, 16/207).
Al-Qurtubi said: the view that they will be in Paradise is the view of the majority. And he said: some scholars denounced any dispute concerning them. (al-Tadhkirah, 2/328).
With regard to the second part, the fate of the children of the kuffaar:
The scholars differed concerning this matter, and there are several views:


That they will be in Paradise. Some of them said, they will be in al-A’raaf [a place between Paradise and Hell]. And the reason why it was said that they will be in Paradise is because this is the ultimate destiny of the people of al-A’raaf. This is the view of the majority of scholars, as reported from them by Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr in al-Tamheed, 18/96.


Their evidence (daleel):


The hadeeth of Samurah (may Allaah be pleased with him), that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saw the children of the Muslims and the children of the Mushrikeen with Ibraaheem (peace be upon him). Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6640.


Hasnaa’ bint Mu’aawiyyah from Bani Suraym said: my paternal uncle told me: I said, O Messenger of Allaah, who will be in Paradise? He said: Prophets will be in Paradise, martyrs will be in Paradise, infants will be in Paradise and baby girls who were buried alive will be in Paradise. Narrated by Imaam Ahmad, 5/409; classed as da’eef by al-Albaani in Da’eef al-Jaami’, 5997.




That they will be with their parents in Hell. Al-Qaadi Abu Ya’laa attributed this view to Ahmad! But Shaykh al-Islam (Ibn Taymiyah) pointed out that this was a grave error. See Haashiyat Ibn al-Qayyim ‘ala Sunan Abi Dawood, 7/87.


Their evidence (daleel):


Salamah ibn Qays al-Ashja’i said: my brother and I came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said that our mother had died during the Jaahiliyyah, and that she had honoured her guests and upheld the ties of kinship, but that she had buried alive a sister of ours during the Jaahiliyyah who had not reached the age of puberty. He said: the one who was buried and the one who buried her are in Hell, unless Islam reached the one who buried the child alive and she became Muslim.


The hadeeth was classed as hasan by Ibn Katheer in al-Tafseer, 3/33, and before him by Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr in al-Tamheed, 18/120.
There are other ahaadeeth, but they are da’eef (weak).


Not giving any opinion on this matter. This is the view of Hammaad ibn Zayd, Hammaad ibn Salamah, Ibn al-Mubaarak and Ishaaq ibn Raahawayh.


Their evidence (daleel):


According to Ibn ‘Abbaas, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was asked about the children of the mushrikeen, and he said, “Allaah knows best what they would have done.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1383, and Muslim, 2660.


There is a similar hadeeth narrated by Abu Hurayrah. Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1384, and Muslim, 2659.




Some scholars say that they (the children of the mushrikeen) will be the servants of the people of Paradise.


Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: there is no basis for this view. (Majmoo’ al-Fataawaa, 4/279)
I say: concerning this there was a hadeeth narrated by al-Tabaraani and al-Bazzaar, but it was classed as da’eef by the imaams – including al-Haafiz ibn Hajar in al-Fath, 3/246.
That they will be tested in the Hereafter, and whoever obeys Allaah will enter Paradise, and whoever disobeys Him will enter Hell. This is the view of the majority of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah, as transmitted by Abu’l-Hasan al-Ash’ari, and it is the opinion of al-Bayhaqi and many other researchers. It is also the opinion favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah. He said that this is what is implied by the texts of Imaam Ahmad, and is the view regarded as most correct by al-Haafiz Ibn Katheer. He said: this view reconciles all the reports, and all the ahaadeeth quoted above support one another. Al-Tafseer, 3/31.
Their evidence:


Anas said: the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Four (kinds of people) will be brought forth on the Day of Resurrection: the infant, the insane, the one who died during the Fatrah (the period between two prophets) and the very old man. All of them will speak in their own defence, then the Lord, may He be blessed and exalted, will say to a neck of Hell, ‘Come forth!’ and He will say to them, ‘I used to send Messengers to My slaves from amongst themselves. Now I am the Messenger of Myself to you. Enter this (i.e., the Fire).’ Those who are decreed to be among the doomed will say, ‘O Lord, how could we enter it when we are trying to escape it?’ And those who are decreed to be among the blessed will rush to enter it. And Allaah will say: ‘You would have been more disobedient towards My Messengers.’ So those will enter Paradise and those will enter Hell.” Narrated by Abu Ya’laa, 4224. There are corroborating reports which were mentioned by Ibn Katheer in al-Tafseer, 3/29-31.


Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: this is the most reasonable of the opinions, which reconciles all the reports and brings all the ahaadeeth into harmony. On this basis, some of them will be in Paradise, as in the hadeeth of Samurah, and some of them will be in Hell, as in the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah. The reply of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) indicates this, as he said: “Allaah knows best what they would have done, because He created them.” It is known that Allaah does not punish anyone on the basis of what He knows, unless what He knows actually comes to pass.
The phrase “Allaah knows best what they would have done” indicates that Allaah knows what they would have done if they had lived. The ones who obey Him at the time of the test are the ones who would have obeyed Him if they had lived in this world, and those ones who disobey Him at that time are the ones who would have disobeyed Him if they had lived in this world. This indicates that He knows about what does not happen and how it would have been if it had happened. And Allaah knows best. (Haashiyat Ibn al-Qayyim ‘ala Sunan Abi Dawood, 7/87).
The ahaadeeth quoted above stating that they will either be in Paradise or in Hell do not contradict what we believe is more likely to be correct. Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: the ahaadeeth about them being tested is more specific. Whoever Allaah knows will obey Him, He puts his soul in al-Barzakh with Ibraaheem and the children of the Muslims who died in a state of Fitrah, and whoever He knows will not obey Him Him, his case rests with Allaah, and on the Day of Resurrection he will be in Hell, as is indicated in the ahaadeeth about the test and as reported by al-Ash’ari from the scholars of Sunnah. Al-Tafseer, 3/33.
The phrase “Allaah knows best what they would have done” does not mean that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was not giving an opinion.
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The evidence used by this group needs further examination. The answer of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) does not mean that he did not want to give an opinion; rather, he was attributing the knowledge of what they would have done if they had lived to Allaah. This was the answer to the question of how they could be with their fathers when they had no deeds in their records – which is part of the hadeeth. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) attributed the knowledge of what they would have done to Allaah; he did not say, Allaah knows best where they will be. This evidence does not support the opinion of this group. And Allaah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
