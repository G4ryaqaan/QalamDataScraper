47819,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47819,"How is the fast of Dawood (peace be upon him) observed, and how can that be reconciled with the prohibition on fasting on Fridays?","I would like to know how to observe the fast of the Prophet of Allaah Dawood (peace be upon him). If his fast – as is well known – means fasting one day and not the next, as the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us, but it is forbidden to single out Fridays for fasting, then how can we fast alternate days? Is it that singling out a Friday for fasting was not forbidden at the time of Dawood (peace be upon him)?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: It is narrated in al-Saheehayn from 
    ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Amr (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The best fasting is the 
    fast of Dawood: he used to fast one day and not the next.” This statement 
    does not contradict the fact that it is not allowed to fast on Fridays, 
    because the prohibition on fasting on Fridays applies to one who singles out 
    a Friday rather than any other day. But the one who observes the fast of 
    Dawood – fasting alternate days – is not singling out a Friday for fasting. 

    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have 
    mercy on him) said:  

    The hadeeth of ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Amr (may Allaah be pleased 
    with him) indicates that if fasting on a Friday or Saturday coincides with a 
    day one usually fasts, without intending to single that day out for fasting, 
    then there is nothing wrong with it, because if he fasts alternate days, 
    then that will coincide with some Fridays and Saturdays. Thus it becomes 
    clear that fasting on these days is not haraam. Otherwise the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would have said: Fast one day 
    and not the next, so long as that (fasting) does not coincide with a Friday 
    or Saturday. 

    Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 6/476. 
Secondly: With regard to 
    your question about the ruling on singling out Friday for fasting in the law 
    of Dawood (peace be upon him): 

    We do not know anything about the practical rulings of the 
    law of Dawood (peace be upon him) with regard to whether it was forbidden to 
    fast on Fridays or other days. What we do know is that every Prophet has a 
    law and a way, but their belief was one and the same, although their laws 
    differed. 

    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):

    “To each among you, We have 
    prescribed a law and a clear way”

    [al-Maa'idah 5:48]

    It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with 
    him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) say: “The Prophets are paternal brothers; their mothers 
    are different, but their religion is the same.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 
    3259; Muslim, 2365. 
What this hadeeth 
    means is that the religion of the Prophets is one, which is Tawheed or 
    belief in the Oneness of Allaah and that He alone is entitled to worship, 
    even though their laws may differ. This is like brothers who have the same 
    father but different mothers (which is what is meant by paternal brothers).",Islam Q&A
47834,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47834,Is repentance accepted if the hadd punishment is not carried out on a person?,"I have a question that is confusing me. If a married or unmarried person commits the sin of immoral conduct, or major sins such as stealing, backbiting, riba, etc, and persists in doing that for a long time, then he comes to know Allaah and he repents sincerely to Allaah, seeking the Face of Allaah, and he seeks the forgiveness of those about whom he gossiped, and returns what he stole, and gives up riba (usury) and all the sins that there are between him and Allaah such as zina, drinking, failing to pray etc, but the hadd punishment is not carried out on him, will Allaah accept his repentance and his worship, no matter how great his sins were? Or is it possible that Allaah will not accept his repentance and his worship will be rejected? Will Allaah save him from the torment of the grave and from Hell? What should he do in order to avoid punishment and so that Allaah will be pleased with him?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    You should note that it is not permissible for a Muslim to 
    think of the sins from which he has repented as being too great, for the 
    mercy, pardon and forgiveness of Allaah are greater than his sins. 

    If the sins had to do with other people, then it is 
    obligatory to restore people’s rights to them. If the sin has to do with 
    something that is between a person and his Lord, then it is sufficient for 
    him to repent, seek forgiveness, regret what he did and resolve not to go 
    back to those sins. It is not a condition of repentance that the hadd 
    punishment be carried out on the repentant person. He should conceal himself 
    with the concealment of Allaah, Achieving sincere repentance is better than 
    confessing so that the hadd punishment may be carried out. 

    This person has repented well and has given back to people 
    what is rightfully theirs, so he should not let the Shaytaan come and spoil 
    his repentance. 

    It should be noted that Allaah turns the bad deeds of the 
    repentant into good deeds. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And those who invoke not any other ilaah (god) along with 
    Allaah, nor kill such person as Allaah has forbidden, except for just cause, 
    nor commit illegal sexual intercourse and whoever does this shall receive 
    the punishment.
69. The torment will be 
    doubled to him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein in 
    disgrace;

    70. Except those who repent and believe (in Islamic 
    Monotheism), and do righteous deeds; for those, Allaah will change their 
    sins into good deeds, and Allaah is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful.

    71. And whosoever repents and does righteous good deeds; 
    then verily, he repents towards Allaah with true repentance”

    [al-Furqaan 25:68-71]

    The offenses which the sultan (Muslim ruler) hears of are the 
    ones for which the hudood punishments must be carried out. As for those of 
    which he does not hear, then it is better to repent from them and to conceal 
    oneself with the concealment of Allaah. 

    The scholars of the Standing Committee said: 

    If the shar’i ruler hears of offenses and they are proven by 
    sufficient evidence, then the hadd punishments must be carried out, and it 
    is not waived by repentance, according to scholarly consensus. The Ghaamidi 
    woman came to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    asking him to carry out the hadd punishment on her after she had repented, 
    and he said concerning her: “She has repented in a manner that if the people 
    of Madeenah were to repent in this way, it would be sufficient for them.” 
    But despite that he carried out the shar’i hadd punishment on her. But no 
    one has the right to do that but the sultaan. 

    But if news of that offence does not reach the sultaan, then 
    the Muslim should conceal himself with the concealment of Allaah and repent 
    sincerely to Allaah, so that Allaah may accept his repentance. 

    Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 
    22/15 
And they said – 
    responding to one who wanted to carry out the hadd punishment and who was 
    not sure that repentance from zina would be accepted – 

    If a person repents to his Lord sincerely, then Allaah has 
    promised that He will accept his repentance, and will compensate him with 
    reward. This is by His kindness and generosity. Allaah says (interpretation 
    of the meaning): 

    “And those who invoke not any other ilaah (god) along with 
    Allaah, nor kill such person as Allaah has forbidden, except for just cause, 
    nor commit illegal sexual intercourse  
    and whoever does this shall receive the punishment.
69. The torment will be 
    doubled to him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein in 
    disgrace;

    70. Except those who repent and believe (in Islamic 
    Monotheism), and do righteous deeds; for those, Allaah will change their 
    sins into good deeds, and Allaah is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful.”

     [al-Furqaan 25:68-70]

    The conditions of repentance include: giving up the sin, 
    regretting what one has done and resolving not to go back to it. If the 
    matter involves the rights of other people, then one must also ask them for 
    forgiveness. 

    It was narrated from ‘Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) that when the women gave their oath of allegiance (bay’ah) 
    to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), he said: 
    “Whoever among you is faithful (to this oath), his reward will be with 
    Allaah. Whoever does any of these things (wrong actions) and is punished for 
    it, that will be an expiation for him. Whoever does any of these things and 
    Allaah conceals him, then it is up to Allaah: if He wills He will punish him 
    and if He wills He will forgive him.” 

    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    encouraged sincere repentance. In the story of Maa’iz he said: “Why did you 
    not leave him alone, perhaps he would have repented and Allaah would have 
    accepted his repentance.” Maalik narrated in al-Muwatta’ from Zayd 
    ibn Aslam that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) said: “O people, the time has come for you stop transgressing 
    the sacred limits set by Allaah.  Whoever commits any of these evil actions, 
    let him conceal himself with the concealment of Allaah, for whoever 
    discloses his actions, then we have to carry out the hadd punishment (that 
    is prescribed in) the Book of Allaah.” 

    So you have to repent sincerely, offer prayers regularly in 
    congregation and do a great deal of good deeds.

47884,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47884,Ruling on praying behind an evildoer,"What is the ruling on praying behind an imam who was sodomized during his childhood and youth with his consent, knowing that he has a beautiful voice and has memorized the entire Qur’aan?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
      Firstly: 
If this imam has repented 
    and changed his ways for the better, then there is nothing wrong with 
    appointing him as an imam to lead others in prayer, or with praying behind 
    him. No one has the right to criticize him or punish him for a sin from 
    which he has repented. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “verily, Allaah forgives all sins”

    [al-Zumar 39:53]

    i.e., for the one who repents. 

    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said: “The one who repents from sin is like one who did not sin at all.” 
    Narrated by Ibn Maajah, 4250; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh 
    Ibn Maajah. 

    But if he is still committing that great evil, he must be 
    advised and warned and made to fear Allaah. If he does not repent, then 
    efforts must be made to prevent him from leading the prayer and he should be 
    replaced with another, righteous imam who adheres properly to his religion 
    and is keen to attain the quality of taqwa. The Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade a man to spit in the direction of 
    the qiblah whilst praying, and he forbade him to lead his people in prayer, 
    and he said to him: “You have offended Allaah and His Messenger.” Narrated 
    by Abu Dawood, 481 and classed as hasan by Shaykh al-Albaan in Saheeh 
    Sunan Abi Dawood. So how about one who commits this great evil? He is 
    more deserving of being prevented from leading the prayers! 

    Moreover, appointing him to lead the prayers is a form of 
    showing respect to him, and an evildoer is not deserving of such respect. 

    The imam is usually someone whom the people take as an 
    example and from whom they learn and receive guidance. The more just and 
    righteous he is, the more that will benefit the people and make them more 
    likely to accept what he says. 

    But if he is an evildoer, the people will not accept anything 
    from him, rather he may be the cause of some of them being led astray, 
    Allaah forbid. 

    Secondly: 
With regard to the 
    validity of prayers offered behind an evildoer, the imams (scholars) 
    differed concerning that. The view of the majority is that a prayer offered 
    behind such a person is valid, although it is makrooh. 

    Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmoo’, 4/151: 

    It is proven in Saheeh al-Bukhaari that Ibn ‘Umar 
    prayed behind al-Hajjaaj ibn Yoosuf, and many other saheeh ahaadeeth 
    indicate that prayers offered behind evildoers and unjust rulers are valid. 

    Our companions said: Prayers offered behind evildoers are not 
    haraam, but they are makrooh. It is also makrooh to pray behind an innovator 
    whose bid’ah does not reach the degree of kufr, but such prayers are valid. 
    But if his bid’ah constitutes kufr then as we have stated before, prayers 
    offered behind him are not valid as is the case with any other kaafir. 
    Al-Shaafa’i stated in al-Mukhtasar that it is makrooh to pray behind 
    an evildoer or an innovator, but if one does that, the prayer is valid. 

    End quote 

    Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah] said in Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 
    23/341: 

    If there are two men of religious commitment, then whichever 
    of them has more knowledge of Qur’aan and Sunnah should be given precedence… 
    If one of them is an evildoer, such as if he is known for lying or being 
    treacherous and so on, and the other is a believer and is pious, then the 
    latter is more entitled to lead the prayers if he is qualified to do so, but 
    if the former has more knowledge of Qur’aan and is more knowledgeable, then 
    prayer behind the evildoer is emphatically forbidden according to some 
    scholars and is disliked according to others… and it is not permissible to 
    appoint the evildoer when it is possible to appoint the righteous man. 

    He also said (23/375): 

    It is not permissible to appoint someone to lead the prayers 
    who consumes hashish or does evil and haraam things when it is possible to 
    appoint someone who is better than him. 
The imams are agreed that 
    it is makrooh to pray behind an evildoer, but they differed as to whether 
    such a prayer is valid. It was said that it is not valid, as is the view of 
    Maalik and Ahmad according to one of the two reports narrated from them. And 
    it was said that it is valid, as is the view of Abu Haneefah and 
    al-Shaafa’i, and the other view narrated from Maalik and Ahmad. But there is 
    no dispute concerning the fact that such a person should not be appointed. 
    End quote. 

    See also al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 4/403-308 

    Thirdly: 

    The scholars have discussed in detail what should be done 
    with an evildoer imam. It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah: 
Based on this, if he is 
    the imam of a mosque and he does not pay heed to advice, then he must be 
    removed if possible and if that will not lead to fitnah (tribulation), 
    otherwise those who are able to should pray behind someone else who is 
    righteous, as a rebuke to him and a denunciation, so long as that will not 
    lead to fitnah (tribulation). 

    If it is not possible to pray behind someone else, then it is 
    prescribed to pray behind him, so as to preserve the interests of the 
    jamaa’ah (group or congregation). 

    If there is the fear that praying behind someone else will 
    provoke fitnah, then (the people) should pray behind him so as to ward off 
    fitnah and so as to do the lesser of two evils.

47889,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47889,How Much Profit Is Allowed in Islam?,Is there a set limit to a trader’s profits?,"There is no set limit to which a trader must adhere in the profits he makes on his business, but if the goods have a known market value, it is not permissible for him to cheat the buyer by selling goods to him for more than the usual market value and taking advantage of his ignorance.",,"Praise be to Allah.There is no set limit to which a trader must adhere in the profits he makes on his business, but if the goods have a known market value, it is not permissible for him to cheat the buyer by selling goods to him for more than the usual market value and taking advantage of his ignorance. 
This is indicated by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Do not meet incoming traders and whoever meets them and buys from them, when the trader reaches the marketplace he has the choice (of annulling the transaction).” (Narrated by Muslim, 1519) 
Islam gives the trader the choice, when he reaches the marketplace, because the one who met him probably cheated him and bought from him at a price other than the market value. If he finds that this is the case, then he may either go ahead with the deal, or cancel it. 
The point in this Hadith is that it is forbidden to meet those traders on the way because of the deceit involved and because they are not being given the proper market price. 
The Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas was asked: Are profits limited in Islam, and if that is the case, what is the highest limit? If there is no limit, how do you explain that? 
They replied:
“There is no limit to profits in trading , rather the matter is subject to supply and demand. But it is good for the Muslim, whether he is a trader or not, to be easy going in buying and selling, and not to exploit the opportunity of his counterpart’s carelessness to cheat him in buying and selling. Rather he should pay attention to the rights of his Muslims brothers.” ( Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 13/91)
They were also asked: Is it permissible for a trader to earn more than 10% on his goods? 
They replied: 
“The trader’s earnings are not restricted to a specific amount according to Shari`ah, but it is not permissible for a Muslim to cheat those who buy from him or to sell for anything other than the known market value. It is prescribed for the Muslim not to go to extremes in seeking profits but rather to be easy going when he buys and when he sells, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) urged forbearance in all dealings.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 13/92)
