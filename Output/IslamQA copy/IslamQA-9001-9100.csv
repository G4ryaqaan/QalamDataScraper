The article explained Prophet Muhammed was insane and suffering from a terribe psychological problem. Is this true? I think it is not, but a majority of people believe so. Is there any way YOU can defend Prophet Muhammed as being a true prophet?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    The Muslim must realize that there is a difference between 
    defending Islam before Muslims, which is done by quoting from the Qur’aan 
    and Sunnah and other reliable sources, and defending Islam before 
    non-Muslims who do not believe in the sources of sharee’ah, so we have to 
    address them on the basis of reason and common sense. 

    In order to answer this question we should realize that such 
    things could not be said by a Muslim who believes in the sharee’ah of Islam, 
    and that such words undoubtedly constitute kufr and heresy. Based on that, 
    it is obvious that the people who said this are not Muslims and do not 
    believe in sharee’ah, rather they are kaafirs who do not believe in Allaah 
    or in the religion of Islam. So we should debate with them on the basis of 
    reason, therefore we say to them the following: 

    This claim can only come from one who hates and is jealous of 
    the religion of Islam, for jealousy and hatred only come to a person when he 
    sees an obvious blessing, which gives rise to hatred and envy in his heart. 
    When those who came up with this claim saw the Muslims and the obvious 
    blessings that they enjoy such as peace of mind and tranquility of heart, 
    and the rare occurrence among the Muslims of evils such as adultery and 
    alcohol consumption, and the low numbers of Muslims afflicted by physical 
    and mental diseases which are rampant among them (the non-Muslims), such as 
    AIDS and other illnesses, and when they saw the glowing history of the 
    Muslims and how they were masters of the world when they adhered to Islam, 
    and other manifest blessings to which everyone attests, and they saw how 
    many people were becoming Muslim every day throughout the world, that upset 
    them and they feared the spread of Islam, but they could not resist it 
    except by using the feeble trick of slander. 

    Intelligent people agree that anyone who makes a claim has to 
    produce evidence to confirm the truth of what he is saying, otherwise it is 
    to be rejected and thrown back in his face. Where is the proof of their 
    sinister claims? 

    If an intelligent man is told that some person managed to 
    convince many people, numbering in the billions, of a specific idea, and 
    that they followed him in that, or that a man on his own was able to succeed 
    in the elections – for example – or to convince the people to vote for him, 
    this intelligent man would attest that this person was brilliant and 
    intelligent and wise. So how about out Prophet Muhammad  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) – may my father and mother be sacrificed 
    for him – whom the Arabs and non-Arabs followed, whose message of Islam 
    spread everywhere and whose message with which Allaah sent him has remained 
    strong until our own times, facts which are attested by everyone? Even those 
    who make these sinister claims believe this deep in their hearts, but their 
    envy and hatred have made them blind. 

    Many of the enemies of Islam, such as the Orientalists who 
    study Islam, affirm the virtues of Islam and the status of our Prophet 
    Muhammad  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and they testify 
    that he was wise and perfect. When enemies testify to the virtues of their 
    opponent, this carries great weight. 

    The Muslim should not pay any attention to these people with 
    ulterior motives who lay in wait to attack Islam and its followers, and try 
    to undermine Islam. Islam is not affected by the slurs of such people or by 
    their praise either.

9021,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9021,What should be done when a husband withholds his wife’s rights in bed?,"I find many topics concerning moslem women and the punishment of ignoring or avoiding their husband in sexual matters.But I would like to know the rights of a woman when this problem is visa-versa, and it's the husband who is denying the wife of her right. And if the husband is ill, does he still not have the obligation towards his wife?",,,"Praise be to Allah.When a husband deprives his wife of the right 
  to intercourse, the scholars call this eelaa’. Eelaa’ means 
  the vow of the husband who is able to have intercourse never to have intercourse 
  with his wife, or not to have intercourse with her for more than four months. 
  The evidence for that is the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Those who take an oath not to have sexual relation 
  with their wives must wait for four months, then if they return (change their 
  idea in this period), verily, Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful[al-Baqarah 
  2:226]  
It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased 
  with him) used to say concerning eelaa’: “If the period of eelaa’ 
  expires, then the husband has either to retain his wife in a handsome manner 
  or to divorce her as Allaah has ordered” (al-Bukhaari, al-Talaaq, 
  4881)  
Eelaa’ is forbidden in Islam because it is a vow not 
  to do something that is obligatory. It is in effect a vow not to have intercourse 
  with one's wife, either never again or for a period that exceeds four months; 
  or else it means vowing that if one’s wife does not do a certain obligatory 
  action or does a certain haraam  action, he will not have intercourse with 
  her. The fuqahaa’ also said that the one who does not have intercourse 
  with his wife for more than four months without swearing an oath, in order to 
  harm her and without having  a valid excuse, also comes under the category 
  of eelaa’.
 The ruling on this matter is: that if 
  he has intercourse with his wife during that period, then he has “returned”, 
  because “returning” in this context means intercourse and in this 
  manner the woman has attained what she is entitled to from him. If he refuses 
  to have intercourse after the stated time limit has expired, then the judge 
  should order him to divorce her if his wife requests that. If he refuses to 
  have intercourse and he refuses to divorce her, then the judge should issue 
  a divorce and annul the marriage.

9022,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9022,Wearing or sitting on skins of wild animals,"It states in Al-Bukhari that you cannot wear leopard style clothing. As I was not aware of this fact before I have therefore many leopard style clothing in my wardrobe. I am not intending to buy anymore clothes of this sort, but I was wondering as I have it now, can I make use of it only at home when there's no men around? Or is it not allowed to be worn even if it's at home?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Perhaps the questioner is referring to the hadeeth narrated by al-Bukhari (5175) from al-Baraa’ ibn ‘Aazib (may Allah be pleased with him) which says that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade al-mayaathir. 
Al-mayaathir was a kind of blanket that they used to put on the saddle of the horse, which was made of silk. And some of the scholars interpreted it as referring to the skins of wild animals. Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Or it may be understood as referring to a stuffed cushion made of animal skin.""(Fath al-Baari, 10/293)
It was proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade wearing the skins of wild animals or sitting on them. 
It was narrated that al-Miqdaam ibn Ma’diyakrib (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbidding the wearing of animal skins or riding on saddles made from them.     
Narrated by Abu Dawood, 4131; classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 3479. 
Al-Tirmidhi (1771) and al-Nasaa’i (4253) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade using animal skins as furnishings. Classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 1450. 
It was narrated from Mu’aawiyah ibn Abi Sufyaan (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade tiger skins.  
Narrated by Abu Dawood, 4239; vclassed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 3566. 
It was narrated from Mu’aawiyah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The angels do not accompany a group of people among whom there is a tiger skin.” 
Narrated by Abu Dawood, 4130; classed as hasan by al-Albani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 3478. 
Al-Mubaarakfoori said in Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi: 
The ahadith indicate that it is not permissible to make use of animal skins. 
The reasons why it is forbidden to make use of them are: 
1 – That involves arrogance and showing off, because it is an imitation of tyrants, and because such things are the adornment of those who live luxurious and extravagant lives. 
See Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi, and Haashiyat al-Sindi ‘ala Ibn Maajah.  
We may add another reason to that, which is that they are naajis (impure), because tanning does not make any skin pure except the skin of an animal that we are permitted to eat. Whatever we are not permitted to eat, its skin cannot be made pure by tanning. This is the view of al-Awzaa’i, ‘Abd-Allah ibn al-Mubaarak and Ishaaq ibn Raahawayh, and it was narrated from Imam Ahmad. See Sharh Saheeh Muslim by al-Nawawi, 4/54; al-Furoo’ by Ibn Muflih, 1/102 
This was also the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him), according to one of his two opinions. Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 21/95. This view was also favoured by Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him); al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 1/74. 
If it is haram to use these skins, it make no difference whether they are worn inside the house or outside, The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told us that the angels do not accompany a group of people among whom there is a tiger skin, as stated above. 
It says in ‘Awn al-Ma’bood: 
The hadeeth indicates that it is makrooh to use tiger skins or to take them along on a journey or to bring them into the house, because the fact that the angels do not accompany a group of people among whom there is a tiger skin indicates that the angels do not join a group or enter a house where that thing is present. That can only be because it is not permissible to use it, as it was narrated that the angels do not enter a house in which there are images or pictures. That is taken as evidence that images are haram and that putting them in houses is haram. 
This applies if the clothes mentioned in the question are made from real tiger skins. With regard to synthetic skins whose colours resemble the colours of animal skins, it is better for him to avoid them so that he will not be accused by someone who does not know what they really are of wearing animal skins which it is haram to wear.

The scholars are unanimously agreed on that, because purity (taharah) is one of the conditions of prayer being valid.

9028,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9028,Removing armpit hairs with the help of another person,Is it allowed to get one's armpit hairs to be removed by another lady using wax?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
Allaah has prescribed for His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his ummah the Sunan al-Fitrah (practices that are in accordance with the natural inclinations of man). These are mentioned in the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her), who said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Ten things are part of the fitrah: cutting the moustache, letting the beard grow, using siwaak (tooth-stick), snuffing up water into the nose, cutting the nails, washing the finger-joints, plucking the armpit hairs, shaving the pubes and washing the private parts after relieving oneself.” Zakariya said: Mus’ab said: I have forgotten the tenth but I think it was rinsing the mouth. 
Narrated by Muslim, 261. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) set a time limit with regard to some of these sunnahs, stating that they should not be left for more than forty days, as narrated in the hadeeth of Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: A time limit was set for us with regard to cutting the moustache, clipping the nails, plucking the armpit hairs and shaving the pubes – we were not to leave these for more than forty days. 
(Narrated by Muslim, 258) 
Secondly: 
It is not permissible for a man to look at the ‘awrah of another man or for a woman to look at the ‘awrah of another woman. 
It was narrated that Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No man should look at the ‘awrah of another man and no woman should look at the ‘awrah of another woman. No man should be with another man under one cover and no woman should be with another woman under one cover.” 
Narrated by Muslim, 338. 
Al-Nawawi said: 
This indicates that it is haraam for a man to look at the ‘awrah of another man and for a woman to look at the ‘awrah of another woman. There is no dispute among the scholars on this point. Similarly it is haraam, according to scholarly consensus, for a man to look at the ‘awrah of a woman and for a woman to look at the ‘awrah of a man. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) warned against a man looking at the ‘awrah of another man and woman looking at the ‘awrah of another woman, and this is more applicable in the case of a man looking at the ‘awrah of a woman and vice versa.  
An exception is made in the case of a married couple, each of whom may look at the ‘awrah of the other. In the case of mahrams, it is permissible for them to look at one another from above the navel and below the knee. All that we have said about looking being forbidden applies when there is no need to do so, and what we have said about it being permissible (among mahrams) applies when there is no desire involved. 
See Fath al-Baari, 9/339 
Thirdly: 
It is permissible for a woman to remove the armpit hair of another woman, because the armpit of a woman is not ‘awrah to another woman, so long as there is no risk of fitnah and so long as there is the certainty that she will not describe the body of the woman she has seen to her husband or any other man or to any other woman.  
See Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 3/258. 
Fourthly: 
With regard to using wax instead of plucking, this is permissible, The Standing Committee was asked: is it permissible for a man to use wax to remove hair such as armpit and pubic hair? 
They replied: 
Yes, it is permissible to use that to remove armpit and pubic hair.

9036,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9036,Numbers of Rak’ahs in Tarawih Prayer,"have asked this earlier but did not get a satisfactory answer. My question is about Taraweeh Prayer in Ramadan. You have answered to me in a question before that Taraweeh should not be more that 11 rakat. It has been authentically reported that Muhammad SAAW prayed Taraweeh 3 times in Ramadan and it consisted 11 Rakah. Also the book by Shaykh Naasir-ud-Din Al-Albani (May Allah have mercy on him)، Qiyam and Taraweeh states that Taraweeh should be 11 Rakah. The sunnah is 11 Rakat. Now the question which is confusing and often becomes a discussion among brothers is whether the number of Rakat in Taraweeh should be 11 Rakat or 20 Rakat. Some people during Ramadan go to masjids where the Imam does 11 Rakats and other go to Masjids where the Imam does 20 Rakats. In most of the Hanafi Masjids around the US the Imam does 20 Rakat. The point to note is whether 20 Rakat or 11 Rakat the Imam completes the entire Qurran during Ramadan. The people are very sentitive about this issue and this issue becomes a topic in gathering in the United States. The people who pray 20 Rakat blame the other groug praying 11 as being wrong and the group praying 11 Rakat blames the group praying 20 as wrong. This is a big fitnah in the US. This leads to disunity. People always quote that in Prophets Mosque the Imam prays 20 Rakats and also in Masjid-ul-Haraam in Mecca the Imam prays 20 Rakat. Also those who during Ramadan go to Saudi Arabia for Umrah say that the Imam prays 20 Rakat. This is a confusion.
Please answer and explain to me the following issues:
1. The sunnah is to pray 11 Rakat then why is Prophets mosque in Medina and also in Masdid-ul-Haram the imam leads the people to pray 20 Rakat? Why? Why is this different from the sunnah?
2. Why are the number of Rakat of Taraweeh in Prophets mosque and Masjid-ul-Haraam 20 Rakat? Please explain to us so.","The one who prays eleven rak’ahs is doing well and is following the Sunnah. Whoever makes the recitation shorter and increases the number of rak’ahs is also doing well. For more, please see the detailed answer.","Scholarly differences should not cause division and fitnah among Muslims


How many rak’ahs in tarawih?


Is there a set number for prayers at night?


Can we offer more than eleven rak’ahs in tarawih?


Long or short recitation in tarawih?","Praise be to Allah.Scholarly differences should not cause division and fitnah among Muslims
We do not think that the Muslims should be so sensitive with regard to issues that are a matter of scholarly differences or make them the cause of division and fitnah among the Muslims. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin  (may Allah have mercy on him) said, when speaking about the matter of one who prays ten rak’ahs with the imam, then sits down and waits for Witr and does not complete the Tarawih prayers with the imam: 
“It grieves us deeply that we find in the Muslim ummah a group which differs concerning matters in which differences of opinion are acceptable, and they take these differences as a means to cause division. Differences within the ummah existed at the time of the Sahabah, yet they remained united. The youth in particular and all those who are committed to Islam must remain united, because they have enemies who are laying in wait.” (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’ 4/225)
How many rak’ahs in tarawih?
Two groups have gone to extremes with regard to this matter. The first group denounced everyone who prays more than eleven rak’ahs and said that doing so was bid’ah. The second group denounced those who do only eleven rak’ahs and said that they are going against scholarly consensus (ijma’). 
Let us read what Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Here we say that we should not go to extremes or be negligent. Some people go to extremes in adhering to the number mentioned in the Sunnah, and say that it is not permissible to do more than the number mentioned in the Sunnah, and they aggressively denounce those who do more than that, saying that they are sinners. 
This is undoubtedly wrong. How can they be sinners, when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), upon being asked about night prayers, said that they are to be done two by two , and he did not specify any particular number? 
Of course, the one who asked him about the night prayer did not know the number, because if he did not know how to do it, it is even more likely that he did not know the number. And he was not one of those who served the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) so that we might say that he knew what happened inside his house. Since the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told him how to do it but did not say how many times, it may be understood that the matter is broad in scope, and that a person may pray one hundred rak’ahs then pray Witr with one rak’ah. 
With regard to the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “Pray as you have seen me praying”, this does not apply in absolute terms even for these people. Hence they do not say that a person should pray Witr with five rak’ahs sometimes and with seven rak’ahs sometimes and with nine rak’ahs sometimes. If we understand it in absolute terms, then we would have to pray Witr with five rak’ahs sometimes and with seven rak’ahs sometimes and with nine rak’ahs sometimes. But what is meant by the hadith is pray as you have seen me praying with regard to how to pray not how many rak’ahs, unless there is a text to state what the number is.  
Whatever the case, a person should not be strict with people with regard to a matter that is broad in scope. We have even seen some brothers who are strict on this matter accusing the imams who pray more than eleven rak’ahs of following bid’ah, and they leave the mosque, thus missing out on the reward of which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever stands with the imam until he finishes (the prayer), the reward of qiyam al-layl will be recorded for him.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 806; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi, 646).
Some of them even sit down after completing ten rak’ahs, thus breaking up the rows of worshippers by sitting there, and sometimes they start talking and disturb the people who are praying. 
We have no doubt that their intentions are good and they are doing their best to come to the right conclusion, but that does not mean that they are correct. 
The other group does the opposite. They sternly denounce those who pray only eleven rak’ahs and say that they have gone against scholarly consensus. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger (Muhammad) after the right path has been shown clearly to him, and follows other than the believers’ way, We shall keep him in the path he has chosen, and burn him in Hell — what an evil destination!” [al-Nisa 4:115]
All the generations who came before you only knew the number as twenty-three rak’ahs, and they denounce anyone who says anything different.” (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’ 4/73-75) 
With regard to the evidence quoted by those who say that it is not permissible to do more than eight rak’ahs in Tarawih, they quote the hadeeth of Abu Salamah ibn ‘Abd al-Rahman, who asked ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her), “How did the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) pray during Ramadan?” She said: “He did not pray more than eleven rak’ahs in Ramadan or at other times. He would pray four, and do not ask how beautiful and long they were, then he would pray four, and do not ask how beautiful and long they were, then he would pray three. I said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, will you sleep before you pray Witr?’ He said, ‘O ‘Aishah, my eyes sleep but my heart does not.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1909; Muslim, 738)
They said: This hadith indicates that the Messenger of Allah was consistent in his prayers at night in Ramadan and at other times. 
The scholars refuted this use of the hadith as evidence by saying that this is what the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did, but the fact that he did something does not imply that it is obligatory. 
Is there a set number for prayers at night?
The evidence that there is no set number for prayers at night – which include Tarawih  – is the hadith of Ibn ‘Umar according to which a man asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about prayer at night. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Prayers at night are to be offered two by two (two rak’ahs at a time). If any of you fears that the time of dawn is approaching then let him pray one rak’ah as Witr.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 846; Muslim, 749) 
Can we offer more than eleven rak’ahs in tarawih?
If we look at what the scholars of the prominent schools of thought said, you will clearly see that this matter is broad in scope and that there is nothing wrong with doing more than eleven rak’ahs. 
Al-Sarkhasi, who is one of the imams of the Hanafi school, said: 
“It is twenty rak’ahs, apart from Witr, in our view.” (Al-Mabsut, 2/145)
Ibn Qudamah said: 
“The favoured view according to Abu ‘Abd-Allah (i.e., Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on him), is that it is twenty rak’ahs. This was the view of al-Thawri, Abu Hanifah and al-Shafi'i. Malik said it is thirty-six.” (Al-Mughni, 1/457)
Al-Nawawi said: 
“Tarawih prayer is Sunnah according to scholarly consensus. Our view is that it is twenty rak’ahs with ten taslims, and it is permissible to pray it individually or in congregation.” (Al-Majmu’, 4/31)
These are the views of the four imams concerning the number of rak’ahs of Tarawih prayer. All of them said something more than eleven rak’ahs. Perhaps the reasons why they said something more than eleven rak’ahs include the following: 
1- They thought that the hadith of ‘Aishah did not mean that this was the specific number.
2- A greater number was narrated from many of the salaf. (Al-Mughni, 2/604; al-Majmu’, 4/32)
3- The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to pray eleven rak’ahs and make them very lengthy, so much so that it used to take him most of the night. Indeed, one night in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) led his Companions in praying Tarawih, he did not end his prayer until just before dawn, and the Sahabah feared that they would miss suhur. The Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) loved to pray behind the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and they did not feel that it was too long. The scholars thought that if the imam made the prayer so long, this would be too difficult for the members of the congregation and that might put them off. So they thought that the imam should make the recitation shorter and increase the number of rak’ahs.
Long or short recitation in tarawih?
The point is that the one who prays eleven rak’ahs in the manner narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is doing well and is following the Sunnah. Whoever makes the recitation shorter and increases the number of rak’ahs is also doing well. A person who does either of these two things is not to be denounced. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said:
 If a person prays Tarawih according to the madhhabs of Abu Hanifah, al-Shafi'i and Ahmad, with twenty rak’ahs, or according to the madhhab of Malik, with thirty-six rak’ahs , or with thirteen or eleven rak’ahs, he has done well, as Imam Ahmad said, because there is nothing to specify the number. So the greater or lesser number of rak’ahs depends on how long or short the qiyam (standing in the prayer) is. (Al-Ikhtiyarat, p. 64)
Al-Suyuti said: 
“What is narrated in the sahih and hasan ahadith is the command to observe night prayers during Ramadan, which is encouraged without specifying a particular number. It is not proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed twenty rak’ahs of Tarawih, rather that he prayed at night, with an unspecified number of rak’ahs. Then he delayed it on the fourth night lest it become obligatory for them and they might not be able to do it. Ibn Hajar al-Haythami said: There is no sahih report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed twenty rak’ahs of Tarawih. The narration which suggests that he “used to pray twenty rak’ahs'' is extremely weak (da’if).” (Al-Mawsu’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 27/142-145)
So you should not be surprised that people pray Tarawih as twenty rak’ahs. There have been generations after generations of those imams (who used to pray twenty rak’ahs), and all of them are good.

2- Scholars divide hair into three categories: 1- Hair which we are commanded to remove or shorten; 2- Hair which we are forbidden to remove; 3-Hair concerning which the texts are silent. For more about each category, see the detailed answer.","Hair which we are commanded to remove or shorten


Hair which we are forbidden to remove


Hair concerning which the texts are silent


Removing hair from the upper lip, thighs, calves and arms


Plucking the hair between the eyebrows


Is plucking eyebrows haram?


What is meant by al-nams (plucking)?","Praise be to Allah.With regard to removing hair or not removing it, the scholars divide hair into three categories: 
Hair which we are commanded to remove or shorten
1 – Hair which we are commanded to remove or shorten. This is known as Sunan al-Fitrah, such as removing the pubic hairs, trimming the moustache and plucking the armpit hairs. That also includes shaving or cutting the hair of the head during Hajj or ‘Umrah. 
The evidence for that is the hadith of ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Ten (actions) are part of the fitrah [natural inclinations of man]: trimming the moustache, letting the beard grow, using the siwak (tooth-stick), rinsing the nose with water, clipping the nails, washing the finger joints, plucking the armpit hairs, shaving the pubes and washing oneself with water after relieving oneself.” 
Zakariyya said: Mus’ab said: And I forgot the tenth but it may have been rinsing the mouth with water. (Narrated by Muslim, 261)
Hair which we are forbidden to remove
2 – Hair which we are forbidden to remove, which includes the eyebrows. The action of removing the hair of the eyebrows is called al-nams. It is also forbidden to remove the hair of the beard. 
The evidence for that is the hadith of ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “Allah has cursed the woman who does tattoos and the one who has them done, the woman who plucks eyebrows (al-namisah) and the one who has it done (al-mutanammisah), and the one who files her teeth for the purpose of beauty, altering the creation of Allah.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5931; Muslim, 2125) 
And it was narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “Be different from the mushrikin: let your beards grow and trim your moustaches.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5892; Muslim, 259) 
al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“The namisah is the woman who removes hair from the face and the mutanammisah is the one who asks to have that done. This action is haram, unless a woman develops a beard or moustache, in which case it is not haram to remove it, rather that is mustahabb in our view.” (Sharh al-Nawawi li Sahih Muslim, 14/106)
Hair concerning which the texts are silent
3 – Hair concerning which the texts are silent and do not say whether it is to be removed or left as it is, such as hair on the legs, hands, cheeks or forehead. 
There is some difference of scholarly opinion concerning this.  
Some said that it is not permissible to remove it, because removing it implies changing the creation of Allah, as Allah tells us that the Shaytan said: 
“ ‘and indeed I will order them to change the nature created by Allah’” [al-Nisa 4:119 – interpretation of the meaning]
Some said that this is one of the things concerning which nothing was said, so the ruling is that it is allowed. It is permissible to leave it or to remove it, because whatever is not mentioned in the Quran or Sunnah is permissible. 
This was the view favoured by the scholars of the Standing Committee and by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin. (See Fatawa al-Mar ah al-Muslimah, 3/879)
Removing hair from the upper lip, thighs, calves and arms
It says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah: 
(a) There is no sin on a woman if she removes hair on her upper lip, thighs, calves and arms. This is not part of the tanammus (plucking ) that is forbidden.(Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 5/194, 195) 
Plucking the hair between the eyebrows
(b)The Committee was asked:
What is the Islamic ruling on plucking the hair between the eyebrows ?
They replied:
“It is permissible to pluck it, because it is not part of the eyebrows.” (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 5/197) 
The Standing Committee was asked: 
What is the ruling on a woman removing hair from her body? 
They replied: 
“It is permissible for her to do that, apart from the hair of the eyebrows and head. It is not permissible for her to remove the hair of her head or to remove any part of the eyebrows, whether by shaving or any other means.” (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 5/194)
Is plucking eyebrows haram?
We should comment on the questioner’s words “I know that plucking the eyebrows is haram and removing facial hair is also haram.” 
As for plucking the eyebrows, this is haram and is a major sin, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed those who do it.
Removing facial hair
But as for removing facial hair , there is a difference of opinion among the scholars as to whether it is permissible to remove it. This is based on their various understandings of the word al-nams. 
Some scholars said that al-nams means removing any facial hair, and they did not limit it to the eyebrows. Others were of the view that al-nams refers to removing the hair of the eyebrows only. This was the view favoured by the Standing Committee as is clear from the fatwas quoted above.
What is meant by al-nams (plucking)? 
It says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah: 
“Al-nams means plucking the hair of the eyebrows, which is not permissible because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed the woman who plucks eyebrows (al-namisah) and the one who has it done (al-mutanammisah).” (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 5/195)

9054,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9054,Ruling on taking an interest-based loan for an urgent need,"What is the ruling on taking an interest-based loan from the bank for an urgent need such as continuing university studies, or buying a car for one who has a family, or buying a house for a family, knowing that the person who is taking the loan cannot find anyone to lend him money without  interest?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: ribaa (interest, 
          usury) is haraam wherever it exists and whatever form it takes. It is 
          haraam for both the owner of the capital and whoever borrows it from 
          him with interest, whether the borrower is rich or poor. Both are guilty 
          of sin and indeed both of them are cursed. Whoever helps them in that, 
          the one who writes down the contract and the one who witnesses it are 
          also cursed, because of the general meaning of the aayahs and sound 
          ahaadeeth which indicate that it is haraam.  
Allaah says (interpretation 
          of the meaning): 
“Those who eat Ribaa will not stand (on the Day of 
          Resurrection) except like the standing of a person beaten by Shaytaan 
          (Satan) leading him to insanity. That is because they say: ‘Trading 
          is only like Ribaa,’ whereas Allaah has permitted trading and forbidden 
          Ribaa. So whosoever receives an admonition from his Lord and stops eating 
          Ribaa, shall not be punished for the past; his case is for Allaah (to 
          judge); but whoever returns (to Ribaa), such are the dwellers of the 
          Fire — they will abide therein.
Allaah will destroy Ribaa and will 
          give increase for Sadaqaat (deeds of charity, alms). And Allaah likes 
          not the disbelievers, sinners” [al-Baqarah 2: 275-276] 
‘Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit (may Allaah be pleased with 
          him) narrated that the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Gold is to be paid 
          for by gold, silver by silver, barley by barley, dates by dates, like 
          by like, payment being made hand to hand. He who made an addition to 
          it, or asked for an addition, in fact dealt in usury [ribaa].” (Narrated 
          by Muslim in his Saheeh).
 It was narrated that 
          Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allaah 
           (peace and blessings of 
          Allaah be upon him) cursed the one who consumes ribaa, the one who pays 
          it, the one who writes it down and the two who witness it. He said they 
          are all the same.” (Narrated by Muslim). 
 ... Whoever is unable to work and is poor 
          is allowed to ask for help, and to take zakaah and social security. 
          
 Secondly: The Muslim, whether he is 
          rich or poor, is not allowed to take a loan from the bank at 5% or 15 
          % or more or less, because that is ribaa and is a major sin. Allaah 
          has caused him to have no need of that because of the ways that He has 
          prescribed such as means of earning a halaal income by working as an 
          employee for company owners, or as a civil servant in permissible work, 
          or by dealing with the money of another on a profit-sharing basis.","Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah li ‘l-Buhooth al-‘Ilmiyyah wa’l-Iftaa’, 13/269"
9055,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9055,Celebrations commemorating some of the scholars,What is the ruling on celebrations held in commemoration of one hundred days or forty days since the death of one of the scholars?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Among the innovated matters that have appeared in some Muslim societies are celebrations to commemorate some of the dead, especially the scholars. These celebrations take place on the anniversary of the death of the person who is being commemorated, and they may take place a year or more after his death.
These celebrations vary from one person to another. If he was one of the common people or one of those who was thought to have knowledge even though he was ignorant, on the fortieth day after his death, his family commemorate his death, calling it “al-arba’een” (forty). They bring people together in a special tent or in the house of the deceased, and they bring Qur’aan-readers to recite Qur’aan, and they prepare a meal like a wedding feast, and they adorn the place with lights and comfortable furnishings. They go to great expense, and their purpose in doing this is to show off. No doubt this is haraam, because it involves wasting the money of the deceased for no legitimate purpose. It beings no benefit to the deceased himself and results in loss for his family. This is the case if there is no one among the heirs who is too young to be in charge of the money, so what do you think if there is someone like that among them! They may even finance that by means of a loan which involves riba (interest) – we seek refuge with Allaah from His Wrath. (al-Ibdaa’, p. 228)
Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:  “One of the things that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) taught was to offer condolences to the family of the bereaved, but it is not part of his teachings to gather together to mourn and read Qur’aan for him (the deceased), whether that is at the grave or elsewhere. All of that is bid’ah and a reprehensible innovation.” (Zaad al-Ma’aad, 1/527) 
‘Ali Mahfooz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “What people do nowadays of offering food to the people who come to offer their condolences, and going to great expense on the nights of mourning, and subsequent occasions such as Friday nights and the forty-day anniversary of the death (al-arba’een), all of that is reprehensible bid’ah which goes against the practice of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the righteous salaf after him.” (al-Ibdaa’, p. 230).
This celebration or commemoration is an innovation and a bid’ah, which was not narrated from the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or from his companions (may Allaah be pleased with them) or the righteous salaf (may Allaah have mercy on them). The Sunnah in this case is to make food for the family of the deceased and to send it to them, not for them to have to make food and invite people to come and eat it. When news of the death of Ja’far ibn Abi Taalib (may Allaah be pleased with him) came, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Make food for the family of Ja’far, because there has come to them that which will preoccupy them.” (Narrated by Ahmad in his Musnad, 1/205. Also narrated by Abu Dawood in his Sunan, 3/497, Kitaab al-Janaa’iz, hadeeth no. 3132. Also narrated by al-Tirmidhi in his Sunan, 2/234, Abwaab al-Janaa’iz, hadeeth no. 1003; he said it is a hasan hadeeth. Also narrated by Ibn Maajah in his Sunan, 1/514, Kitaab al-Janaa’iz, hadeeth no 1610. Also narrated by al-Haakim in al-Mustadrak, 1/372, Kitaab al-Janaa’iz; he said, it is a hadeeth whose isnaad is saheeh although they (al-Bukhaari and Muslim) did not narrate it, and al-Dhahabi agreed with him in his Talkhees).
Jareer ibn ‘Abd-Allaah al-Bajali said: “We used to consider gathering with the family of the deceased and making food to be a form of wailing.” (Narrated by Ibn Maajah in his Sunan, 1/514, Kitaab al-Janaa’iz, hadeeth no. 1612. Al-Busayri said in Zawaa’id Ibn Maajah (2/35): “This is a saheeh isnaad; the men of the first isnaad are according to the conditions of al-Bukhaari, and the men of the second isnaad are according to the conditions of Muslim.”)
But if the person whose death is being commemorated was one of the scholars, on the anniversary of his death, one or two years later, then they hold special celebrations. A group of researchers agree to write about his life and character, or his method of writing, and everything that has to do with him, then they present that research on that day, and publish his books, or the most important and most famous of them, and they are distributed in the marketplaces to keep his memory alive, or so they say, and to make known the efforts he made to spread and publish knowledge and so on.
If he was a king, ruler or president, this occasion is celebrated and the most senior of those who are present speak of his legacy and work in government, and some books about him may be published on this occasion. Some people may go to his grave and recite wird over it, or recite al-Faatihah for his soul, All of that is bid’ah for which Allaah has not revealed any authority.
There is nothing inherently wrong with publishing the books of a scholar, or writing his biography or writing about his methodology, or printing his books. These things should be done if he deserves that. But that should not be done specifically at a certain time, or be accompanied by celebrations, festivals and speeches etc. The same applies to kings and rulers.
Celebrations held to commemorate the death of scholars, rulers and some common folk are an innovation, and that is sufficient to condemn them.
There was no one who had more knowledge than the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and there was no one whose way of calling others to Islam was better. No one had a nobler status or a higher rank than he did (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), for he is the best of all creation. But despite that the Sahaabah did not commemorate his death, even though no person has ever been more dearly loved than the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was loved by the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) or the Taabi’een or the righteous salaf (may Allaah have mercy on them). If there had been any good in doing so, they would have done it before us.
Respecting the scholars is not done by holding celebrations in their memory; it is done by striving to benefit from the things they have written, by publishing and reading and commenting etc.
This applies if they are deserving of that, by virtue of their having lived according to the way of the righteous salaf, and kept away from the way of the deviant sects or the influence of the west, etc.
The memory and narrations of the scholars of the righteous salaf and those who came after them, and the knowledge that they presented to the people, have been preserved. The scholar may have died and departed from this world, but his knowledge remains and is passed down by the people from one generation to the next.
Because of the benefit that people gain from their knowledge, they pray for mercy for them and pray that they may be rewarded. This is the greatest way in which their memory can be kept alive.
But organizing celebrations in their memory, or seeking blessing by visiting the places where they lived and taught, and their relics, or circumambulating their graves – all of that is bid’ah, some of which may even reach the degree of shirk. We seek refuge with Allaah from that.
If these scholars, whose memories are celebrated and from whom people seek blessing by visiting the places where they lived and taught, were alive, they would denounce these things that are being done.
But some people have been misled by their own whims and desires and by the Shaytaan, and by those who advocate bid’ah for worldly purposes or to gain leadership over the people. So they have slipped in the maze of bid’ah from which there is no escape apart from returning to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and adhering to them, and to that on which the scholars of this ummah are agreed, and giving up all newly-invented innovations which are evil in and of themselves and which lead to even greater evils and disasters.
We ask Allaah to guide us and them to the Straight Path, the path of those with whom Allaah is pleased, the Prophets, the Siddeeqeen, the martyrs and the righteous. May He keep us far away from the path of those with whom He is angry and those who have gone astray, for He is Able to do all things.","Al-Bida’ al-Hawliyyah li Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Ahmad al-Tuwayjri, p. 350"
9056,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9056,Ruling on using perfumes which contain alcohol,What is the ruling on using perfumes which contain some alcohol?,,,"Praise be to Allah.The basic principle is that the perfumes which are common among people are permissible, except in cases where they are known to contain something which would prevent their use, such as their containing intoxicants, or where a large quantity of the perfume would cause intoxication, or it contains something impure (najaasah), etc. But in principle the perfumes which are common among people are permissible, such as ‘ood, amber and musk, etc.
 If a person knows that there is a perfume which contains something that would prevent its use, such as intoxicants or impure materials (najaasah), then he should not use it. That includes colognes, because we know from the testimony of the doctors that they are not free from intoxicants. They contain a large amount of alcohol which is an intoxicant. So we should not use them unless we find kinds which are free of such materials. There are enough kinds of permissible perfumes to leave us with no need for these, praise be to Allah. The same applies to all kinds of drinks or foods which contain intoxicants – we should not use them. The guideline is that whatever intoxicates in large quantities is haraam in small quantities. The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whatever intoxicates in large quantities is haraam in small quantities.”

9057,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9057,Mocking innovators,"I know that mocking the Sunnah or any part of Islam makes a person a kaafir.  But what if someone mocks the beliefs of people of bid'ah?  For example, a person jokes to his friend when it's time for salaat to make fun of the Murji'ah : ""Oh, we don't have to pray...it's in your heart, remember?"" but he prays, understanding that it was a joke to show the riduculousness of the Murji'ah beliefs.  I know that false talk is a sin, even in joking, but is this (above example) kufr akbar because the joke involves a major part of Islam, although it was aimed at bidah and not Islam?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Mocking the kaafirs for their kufr or the 
    innovators for their innovations (bid’ah) is permissible because they enjoy no sanctity or protection with regard to their sin and evildoing in 
    which they regard as permissible that which Allaah and Islam have forbidden. But this is only so long as the mocking does not go beyond the 
    framework of dignity and truth, and it is not taken as a usual habit, and the jokes do not outweigh one's seriousness. But what we are warning 
    against has become the habit of many people. 
If one is to mock them, it should be for 
    their going against the Sunnah, not for their different ways of dressing, walking, etc. 
But is it a sin? 
The correct view is that it is not a sin, 
    rather this is something that it is permissible to talk about and joke about. The fact that the sin that we are mocking does not constitute kufr 
    that puts a person beyond the pale of Islam makes it even more appropriate to joke about their sin,  because by forsaking the truth and following 
    falsehood, they have mocked the sanctity of Allaah.  
Al-Laalkaani narrated, with isnaads, some 
    reports from some of the salaf concerning such cases: 
-He narrated from al-A’mash that Ibraaheem said: “There is no gheebah [backbiting] concerning one who 
    follows bid’ah.”
-He narrated that al-Hasan al-Basri said: “There are three who have no protection from gheebah, one of 
    whom is the one who follows bid’ah and is extreme in his bid’ah.”
-He narrated from Hishaam that al-Hasan said: “There is no gheebah in the case of one who follows 
    bid’ah and one who commits evil.”
-He narrated that al-Hasan said: “There is no gheebah in the case of the people of bid’ah.”
-He narrated that Katheer Abu Sahl said: “It is said that there is no sanctity for the people who 
    follow their whims and desires.”
(I’tiqaad Ahl al-Sunnah, 1/140). 
The example which is mentioned in the question, which is, “Oh, we don’t have to pray, it’s in 
    your heart, remember?” is not kufr because the one who says it does not intend to mock the prayer, rather he intends to mock these words that go 
    against sharee’ah, and to show that they are false. 
The point is that making fun of something 
    that the innovators say is not haraam and does not constitute kufr. 
But we do not encourage denouncing the 
    innovators by mocking them; rather we should debate with them in the way that is best. Your concern when debating with them should be to guide 
    them to the Straight Path. Allaah said to Moosa and Haroon when He sent them to Pharaoh (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And speak to him mildly, perhaps he may 
    accept admonition or fear (Allaah)”

Can you read any du’a in al-Qunut?


What to read in witr instead of du’a al-qunut?


Is du’a al-qunut obligatory?","Praise be to Allah.Is it permissible to read du’a al-qunut from a paper?
There is nothing wrong with reading the du’a of Qunut from a piece of paper or a booklet in Witr prayer until one is able to memorize it, after which you can stop reading it and can recite it from memory. It is also permissible to recite Quran from the Mus-haf during nafl prayers for those who have not memorized a lot of Quran. 
Shaykh Ibn Baz was asked about the ruling on reading Quran from the Mus-haf in Tarawih prayer, and what the evidence is for that from the Quran and Sunnah. 
He replied: 
“There is nothing wrong with reading from the Mus-haf when praying at night during Ramadan because that will enable the believers to hear all of the Quran. And because the evidence of Shari`ah from the Quran and Sunnah indicates that it is prescribed to recite Quran in prayer, which includes both reading it from the Mus-haf and reciting it by heart. 
`Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) narrated that she told her freed slave Dhakwan to lead her in praying night prayers during Ramadan, and he used to read from the Mus-haf. This was narrated by al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) in his Sahih, in a mu’allaq majzum report.” (Fatawa Islamiyyah, 2/155) 
Can you read any du’a in al-Qunut?
It is not obligatory for the du’a of Qunut to be in the words narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him); rather it is permissible for the worshipper to say other words or to add to them. Even if he were to recite verses from the Quran that include words of supplication, that would be sufficient. 
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Note that there is no specific du’a for Qunut according to the preferred point of view. Any du’a that is said will serve as Qunut, even if one recites a verse or verses from the Quran that include words of supplication, this will count as Qunut, but it is better to recite the words that were narrated in the Sunnah.” (Al-Adhkar al-Nawawiyyah, p. 50)
What to read in witr instead of du’a al-qunut?
As for what the brother mentions about reciting Quran instead of the du’a of Qunut , there is no doubt that he should not do this, because the purpose behind Qunut is du’a or supplication. Hence if these verses include words of supplication, it is permissible to recite them as Qunut, for example, the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Our Lord! Let not our hearts deviate (from the truth) after You have guided us, and grant us mercy from You. Truly, You are the Bestower” [Al ‘Imran 3:8]
Is du’a al-qunut obligatory?
 With regard to what the brother says about Qunut being obligatory, this is not correct, because Qunut is Sunnah. Based on this, if a worshipper omits Qunut, his prayer is still valid. 
Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about the ruling on reciting the du’a of Qunut in Witr during the nights of Ramadan, and whether it is permissible to omit it.  
He replied: 
“Qunut is Sunnah in Witr and if a person omits it sometimes, there is nothing wrong with that.” 
And he was asked about a person who always recites Qunut in Witr every night – was that narrated from our forebears (the salaf)? 
He replied: 
“There is nothing wrong with that, rather it is Sunnah, because when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught al-Husayn ibn ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) to say Qunut in Witr, he did not tell him to omit it sometimes or to do it all the time. This indicates that either is permissible. Hence it was narrated that when Ubayy ibn Ka’b (may Allah be pleased with him) led the Companions in prayer in the Mosque of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), he used to omit Qunut some nights; perhaps that was in order to teach the people that it is not obligatory.

Allah has commanded us to seek refuge with Him from the accursed Shaytan when reciting Quran. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So when you want to recite the Quran, seek refuge with Allah from Shaytan (Satan), the outcast (the cursed one).” [al-Nahl 16:98]
The meaning of ‘A’oodhu Billahi min al-Shaytaan ir-rajeem’
What seeking refuge with Allah means is turning to Allah for protection from the evil of every evil one. It is said in order to ward off evil from a person. It is as if the one who says it is saying: I am seeking refuge with Allah from the accursed Shaytan lest he harm me in my spiritual or worldly affairs, or he prevents me from doing what I have been commanded or he makes me do something that I have been forbidden to do. 
Is it obligatory to say ‘A’oodhu Billahi min al-Shaytan ir-rajeem’ ?
The majority of scholars say that saying “A’oodhu Billah…” is mustahabb (encouraged), it is not obligatory. 
Some scholars said that it is obligatory, quoting this verse as evidence and saying that the command mentioned therein implies that it is obligatory. This is the view of Ibn Hazm, and Ibn Katheer was also inclined towards this view. (See Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 1/14)
The Standing Committee favoured the view that saying “A’oodhu Billah…” is Sunnah. 
It says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah: 
“Saying “A’oodhu Billah…” is Sunnah and if a person does not say it in his prayer, either deliberately or because he forgot, that does not affect him.” (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 6/381)
Formulas of saying ‘A’oodhu Billahi min al-Shaytan ir-rajeem’ 
There are different ways of saying these words of seeking refuge with Allah: 
1-A’oodhu Billahi min al-Shaytan ir-rajeem (I seek refuge with Allah from the accursed Shaytan)
2-A’oodhu Billah as-samee’ il-‘aleem min al-Shaytan ir-rajeem (I seek refuge with Allah, the All-Hearing, All-Knowing, from the accursed Shaytan)
3-Adding to the second version the words min hamzihi wa nafkhihi wa nafathihi (from his suffocation, his arrogance and his poetry). (See Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 1/13)
Should we recite  ‘A’oodhu Billahi min al-Shaytan ir-rajeem’ in every rak`ah?
The words “A’oodhu Billah…” may be said during prayer and at other times. In prayer it is sufficient to recite them once, in the first rak’ah. This does not have to be said in every rak’ah. 
Ibn Qudamah said: 
“Muslim narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: “When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) got up from the second rak’ah, he would start to recite al-Fatihah from the words Al-hamdu Lillahi Rabb il-‘Alameen, and he did not pause beforehand.” This indicates that he did not recite the opening du’a or say “A’oodhu Billah…” 
With regard to saying “A’oodhu Billah…” there is a different report from Ahmad which says that it should be said in every rak’ah. It was also narrated from him that it should be said in the first rak’ah only. This is the view of ‘Ata, al-Hasan, al-Nakha’i and al-Thawri, because of the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah mentioned above, and because the prayer is considered to be a single action, so it does not have to be said again. 
The second report, which is that one should say “a’oodhu Billah…” in each rak’ah, is the view of Ibn Sireen and al-Shafi'i, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“So when you want to recite the Quran, seek refuge with Allah from Shaytan (Satan), the outcast (the cursed one)” [al-Nahl 16:98]
That implies that one should repeat the words “a’oodhu Billah…” each time one wants to recite again, because it is prescribed when reciting Quran, so if you want to recite Quran again you should say these words again, as if each rak’ah is an independent action.” (Al-Mughni, 2/216)
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“The view that it is sufficient to say “a’oodhu Billah…” once is more correct.” (Zad al-Ma'ad, 1/242)
Al-Shawkani said: 
“The ahadeeth which were narrated concerning seeking refuge with Allah indicate only that this should be done in the first rak’ah… 
In order to be on the safe side, we should limit ourselves to what has been narrated in the Sunnah, which is to say “a’oodhu Billah…” before the first rak’ah only.” (Nayl al-Awtar, 2/231)
When should we recite A’oodhu Billahi min al-Shaytan ir-rajeem’ in prayer?
The fuqaha differed as to where in the prayer the words “a’oodhu Billah…” should be said. Some said that it should be after reciting Quran, which is a da’eef (weak) view. 
Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
‘The well-known view, which is that of the majority, is that the words “a’oodhu Billah…” should be said before reciting Quran, to ward off whispers from the Shaytan therein.” (Tafseer al-Quran il-‘Azeem, 1/13)
Al-Jassas said: 
“The view of those who say that the words “a’oodhu Billah…” should be said after finishing the recitation from the Quran is odd. Rather these words should be said before reciting, to ward off the whispers of the Shaytan from the recitation. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Never did We send a Messenger or a Prophet before you but when he did recite the Revelation or narrated or spoke, Shaytaan (Satan) threw (some falsehood) in it. But Allah abolishes that which Shaytaan (Satan) throws in” [al-Hajj 22:52] 
Allah has commanded us to seek refuge with Him before reciting, for this reason.” (Ahkaam al-Quran, 3/283)

9063,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9063,Can a woman say “Ameen” out loud when she is praying with her husband at home?,"Do women say ""Ameen"" quietly in salaah at home with their husbands and in the masjid?  What about with other women?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
Saying “Ameen” is Sunnah for every worshipper 
    when he finishes reciting al-Faatihah. 
Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said 
    in al-Majmoo’, 3/371: 
Saying “Ameen” is Sunnah for every worshipper 
    after al-Faatihah, whether he is leading the prayer or is following an imam, or praying alone, for men, women and children, whether they are 
    praying standing up, sitting down or lying down (i.e., if they have an excuse), whether they are praying an obligatory prayer or a naafil prayer, 
    whether the prayer is one in which Qur’aan is recited silently or out loud. There is no difference of opinion concerning this among any of our 
    companions. 
Secondly: 
Women are not permitted to raise their voices 
    when they are present with men who are not their mahrams. Hence the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade women to say 
    “Subhaan-Allaah” during prayer if they want to alert the imam to something; rather they should alert him by clapping. 
It was narrated from Sahl ibn Sa’d al-Saa’idi 
    that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) went to Bani ‘Amr ibn ‘Awf to reconcile between them. (In the 
    meantime) the time for prayer came, and the muezzin came to Abu Bakr and said, “Will you lead the people in prayer, and should I say the iqaamah?” 
    He said, “Yes.” So Abu Bakr started to lead the prayer. Then the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came when 
    the people were still praying, and he passed through the rows until he stood in the first row. The people clapped but Abu Bakr used not to glance 
    sideways whilst he was praying. When the people’s clapping continued, he turned and saw the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him). The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) gestured to him to stay where he was, so Abu Bakr 
    (may Allaah be pleased with him) raised his hands and praised Allaah for what the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) had told him to do. Then Abu Bakr stepped back until he was level with the row and the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) came forward and led the rest of the prayer. When he finished he said, “O Abu Bakr, what kept you from staying put when I told 
    you to?” Abu Bakr said, “It was not right for the son of Abu Quhaafah [referring to himself] to lead the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) in prayer.” The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “ Why did you clap so 
    much? If something happens to anyone during his prayer, let him say Subhaan Allaah, for if he says Subhaan Allaah, people will take notice. 
    Clapping is only for women.” 
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 652; Muslim, 421) 
Ibn Hajar said: 
He did not let women say Subhaan Allaah because they are commanded to lower their voices in 
    prayer in all circumstances, because of the fear that their voices may cause fitnah (temptation). He forbade men to clap because this is something 
    for women. 
Fath al-Baari, 
    3/77 
This prohibition applies if there are 
    non-mahram men present. But if she is with a group of women or with men who are her mahrams, there is nothing wrong with her reciting and saying 
    “Ameen” out loud. 
Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    said in al-Mughni (3/38): 
A woman may recite out loud in prayers where Qur’aan is recited out loud, but if there are men 
    present, she should not recite out loud, unless they are her mahrams, in which case she may do that. 
Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmoo’ (3/390): 
With regard to women, most of our companions 
    said that if she is praying on her own, or in the presence of other women or men who are her mahrams, she may recite out loud, whether she is 
    leading other women in prayer or praying alone. But if she is praying in the presence of non-mahram men she should recite silently… This is our 
    opinion… al-Qaadi Abu al-Tayyib said: The ruling on saying Allaahu akbar in prayers where Qur’aan is recited out loud and prayers where it is 
    recited silently is the same as the ruling on reciting Qur’aan. 
The ruling on saying Ameen in prayers where 
    Qur’aan is recited out loud and prayers where it is recited silently is the same as the ruling on reciting Qur’aan. 
Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    said in al-Mughni (2/162): 
It is Sunnah for the imam and the members of the congregation to say it (Ameen) out loud when 
    Qur’aan is recited out loud, and to say it silently in prayers where Qur’aan is recited silently. 
Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmoo’, 3/371: 
If the prayer is one in which Qur’aan is recited silently, then the imam and others should say 
    Ameen silently, following the manner of recitation. If it is a prayer in which Qur’aan is recited out loud, it is mustahabb for the members of the 
    congregation to say Ameen out loud. There is no difference of opinion on this point. 
In conclusion: 
It is permissible for a woman to recite 
    Qur’aan and say Ameen out loud in prayer, unless she is praying in the presence of a non-mahram man, in which case she should say it silently.

9067,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9067,Should He Forsake His Family Who Reject the Sunnah?,"If a person's family rejects the necessity of following anything that's in hadeeth (prophetic traditions) at all, and says you can follow only the Qur'an, can you give them salaams (Islamic greetings) and say ""’Eid Mubarak"" (Happy ‘Eid) to them to reduce fitnah (trouble) and not make them upset?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    Every Muslim has to believe in all the hadeeths of the 
    Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) – if they are saheeh 
    (authentic) – and not reject any of them, because his hadeeths and his 
    Sunnah (teachings) are revelation (wahy) from Allah. Whoever rejects the 
    hadeeth of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) 
    has rejected revelation from Allah. 

    Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “By the star when it goes down (or vanishes).

    Your companion (Muhammad) has neither gone astray nor has 
    erred.

    Nor does he speak of (his own) desire.

    It is only a Revelation revealed.

    He has been taught (this Quran) by one mighty in power 
    (Gabriel).

    One free from any defect in body and mind then he (Gabriel in 
    his real shape as created by Allah) rose and became stable.” [53:1-6] 

    Allah has commanded the people to obey His Prophet (peace and 
    blessings of Allah be upon him). He has enjoined this in many verses of the 
    Quran, of which we will quote some. Allah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “Say (O Muhammad): “Obey Allah and the Messenger (Muhammad).” 
    But if they turn away, then Allah does not like the disbelievers.” [3:32] 

    “He who obeys the Messenger (Muhammad), has indeed obeyed 
    Allah, but he who turns away, then we have not sent you (O Muhammad) as a 
    watcher over them.” [4:80] 

    “O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger 
    (Muhammad), and those of you (Muslims) who are in authority. (And) if you 
    differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allah and His Messenger, 
    if you believe in Allah and in the Last Day. That is better and more 
    suitable for final determination.” [4:59] 

    “And perform As‑Salah (Iqamat‑as-Salah), and give Zakah and 
    obey the Messenger (Muhammad) that you may receive mercy (from Allah).”
     [24:56] 

    And there are many similar verses. 

    The one who rejects the Sunnah is a kafir and an apostate. 

    Al-Suyooti (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his essay 
    Miftah al-Jannah fi Ihtijaj bi’l-Sunnah: 

    Note that whoever denies that the hadeeth of the Prophet 
    (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), whether it describes his words 
    or deeds, so long as it meets the conditions outlined by the scholars, may 
    be quoted as evidence, is a kafir and has gone beyond the pale of Islam; he 
    will be gathered with the Jews and the Christians or whomever Allah wills 
    among the kafir sects [i.e., on the Day of Resurrection]. 

    Those who want to restrict themselves to the Quran only are 
    called al-Quraniyyoon. This view of theirs is an old view which the 
    Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) warned against in more 
    than one hadeeth, as we shall see below. Among the soundest evidence that 
    this view is false is the fact that those who say this do not really follow 
    what they say. 

    How do these people pray? How many times do they pray each 
    day and night? What are the conditions and details of zakah? What is the 
    nisab (threshold of wealth) for paying zakah? What is the amount that must 
    be paid? How do they do Hajj and ‘Umrah? How many times do they 
    circumambulate the Ka’bah? How many times do they go back and forth between 
    al-Safa and al-Marwah? 

    There are many other issues for which the details are not 
    narrated in the Quran, rather they are mentioned in the Quran in general 
    terms, and the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) 
    explained them in detail in his Sunnah. 

    Would these people refrain from acting upon these rulings 
    because they are not narrated in the Quran? 

    If their answer is yes, then they have passed judgement 
    against themselves that they are kafirs, because they have denied a basic 
    principle of Islam that no Muslim has any excuse for not knowing and on 
    which there is unanimous consensus among the Muslims.  

    If they reply that they do not refrain from following these 
    rulings, then they have demonstrated that their view is false. 

    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said – after quoting the verses 
    that enjoin following the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon 
    him) –  

    These texts enjoin following the Messenger (peace and 
    blessings of Allah be upon him) even if we do not find what he said 
    specifically referred to in the texts of the Quran. These verses also enjoin 
    following the Quran even if we do not find what is said in the Quran 
    specifically mentioned in the hadeeth of the Messenger (peace and blessings 
    of Allah be upon him). 

    So we must follow the Quran and we must follow the Messenger 
    (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Following the one implies 
    following the other, for the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon 
    him) conveyed the Book, and the Book commands us to follow the Messenger 
    (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The Book and the Messenger 
    (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) do not contradict one another at 
    all, just as the Book does not contradict itself. Allah says (interpretation 
    of the meaning): 

    “Had it been from other than Allah, they would surely, have 
    found therein many a contradiction.” [4:82] 

    And there are many hadeeths from the Prophet (peace and 
    blessings of Allah be upon him) which state that it is obligatory to follow 
    the Quran and that it is obligatory to follow his Sunnah, for example, the 
    hadeeth in which he said: “I do not want to find any one of you reclining on 
    his pillow, and when he hears of something that I have commanded or 
    forbidden, he says, ‘Between us and you there stands this Quran, whatever we 
    find is permissible in it we will take as permissible, and whatever we find 
    is forbidden in it we will take as forbidden.’ For I have been given the 
    Book and something like it with it; it is like the Quran or more.” This 
    hadeeth is narrated in the books of Sunan and Musnad from the Prophet (peace 
    and blessings of Allah be upon him) with a number of isnads (chains of 
    narration) from Abu Tha’labah, Abu Rafi’, Abu Hurayrah and others. 

    In Saheeh Muslim is it narrated from Jabir that the Prophet 
    (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said in his Farewell Sermon: “I 
    am leaving behind among you something which, if you adhere to it, you will 
    not go astray after that. It is the Book of Allah.” The version narrated by 
    al-Hakim says “The Book of Allah and my Sunnah.” (Classed as 
    saheeh/authentic by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Jami’, 2937). 

    In al-Saheeh it is narrated from ‘Abd-Allah ibn Abi Awfa that 
    it was said to him: Did the Messenger of Allah leave a will? He said, No. It 
    was said, How then is it prescribed for people to make wills when the 
    Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not make a will? He 
    said, He made a will in which he enjoined (adherence to) the Book of Allah. 

    (Narrated by Muslim, 1634) 

    The Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah explains the Quran, as 
    it explains the number of prayers, how much should be recited in them, which 
    should be recited out loud and which quietly. It also explains the amounts 
    of zakah to be paid and the threshold at which zakah becomes due; the 
    rituals of Hajj and ‘Umrah; how many times one should circumambulate the 
    Ka’bah, go between al-Safa and al-Marwah and stone the Jamarat (pillars), 
    etc. 

    When any Sunnah is proven to be saheeh, the Muslims are 
    agreed that it is obligatory to follow it. There may be something in the 
    Sunnah which a person thinks appears to go against the apparent meaning of 
    the Quran and add to it, such as the Sunnah which explains the threshold of 
    stealing at which the hadd (Islamic legal) punishment becomes due, and the 
    Sunnah which stipulates that the married adulterer is to be stoned. This 
    Sunnah must also be followed, according to the view of the 
    Sahabah/Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) and those who followed 
    them in truth, and all the groups of Muslims. 

    Adapted from Majmoo’ al-Fatawa, 19/84-86 

    That which was brought by the Messenger (peace and blessings 
    of Allah be upon him) is true just as the Quran is true.

     Secondly: 

    You should not forsake your family; rather you should treat 
    them kindly and strive to call them to follow and accept the Sunnah. 

    Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Invite (mankind, O Muhammad) to the way of your Lord (i.e. 
    Islam) with wisdom (i.e. with the Divine Revelation and the Quran) and fair 
    preaching, and argue with them in a way that is better. Truly, your Lord 
    knows best who has gone astray from His path, and He is the Best Aware of 
    those who are guided.” [16:125] 

    “And We have enjoined on man (to be dutiful and good) to his 
    parents. His mother bore him in weakness and hardship upon weakness and 
    hardship, and his weaning is in two years; give thanks to Me and to your 
    parents. Unto Me is the final destination.

    But if they (both) strive with you to make you join in 
    worship with Me others that of which you have no knowledge, then obey them 
    not; but behave with them in the world kindly, and follow the path of him 
    who turns to Me in repentance and in obedience. Then to Me will be your 
    return, and I shall tell you what you used to do.” [31:14-15]

The scholars said concerning their madhhab (school of thought): “It is a way which outwardly is Raafidi but inwardly conceals pure kufr…” 
Ibn al-Jawzi said: “What they say is a denial of the Creator and of Prophethood and of the acts of worship, and denial of the resurrection. But they do not manifest this openly at the beginning. Rather they claim that Allaah is true and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah, and that the religion is true. But they say that these concepts have a hidden meaning which differs from the apparent meaning. Iblees has deceived them and has made their way attractive to them.” 
Similar rulings were applied to other groups besides the Ismailis who follow bid’ah and who were deemed to be kaafirs, such as the Nusayris and the Raafidis. So it is not permitted to marry any of them, or for them to marry any of the Muslims. 
It was narrated that Talhah ibn Musarrif (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “The women of the Raafidis should not be married, because they are apostates.” 
Shaykh al-Islam (Ibn Taymiyah) said in his discussion of the extreme views of the Raafidis and of the Nusayris and Ismailis concerning ‘Ali, that all of these kuffaar are worse kaafirs than the Jews and Christians. If one of them does not make an open display of that, then he is one of the munaafiqeen (hypocrites) who will be in the lowest level of Hell, and those who do make an open display of that are the worst of the kaafirs in kufr. And he said: it is not permitted to marry their women, because they are apostates and are the worst kind of apostates. 
Concerning the Nusayris he said: the scholars are agreed that it is not permitted to intermarry with them, or for a man to marry his female relative to one of them, or to marry one of their women. 
Mutawaatir reports from the righteous salaf indicate that it is forbidden for a Muslim woman from among Ahl al-Sunnah to marry someone from among the followers of bid’ah who has been judged to be a kaafir, and that this type of marriage is null and void.

If you read a tafseer (commentary) on what you read, this will help you to ponder the meanings. One of the best and most concise Tafseers is Tafseer al-Sa’di (may Allah have mercy on him). 
2 – You should remember Allah a great deal (dhikr), by reciting the dhikrs narrated in the saheeh ahaadeeth (authentic narrations)such as Laa ilaaha ill-Allah (there is no god but Allah), Subhaan Allah wa’l-hamdu Lillaah wa laa ilaaha ill-Allah wa Allahu akbar (Glory be to Allah, praise be to Allah, there is no god but Allah, and Allah is great), and so on. See al-Adhkaar by al-Nawawi and similar books. 
Remembering Allah increases one’s faith and brings peace to the heart. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Those who believed (in the Oneness of Allah — Islamic Monotheism), and whose hearts find rest in the remembrance of Allah verily, in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest”
[al-Ra’d 13:28]
Observe regular prayer, fast and observe all the pillars of Islam, whilst also hoping for the mercy of Allah; put your trust in Allah in all your affairs. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The believers are only those who, when Allah is mentioned, feel a fear in their hearts and when His Verses (this Quran) are recited unto them, they (i.e. the Verses) increase their Faith; and they put their trust in their Lord (Alone);
Who perform As-Salaah (establish prayer) and spend out of that We have provided them.
It is they who are the believers in truth. For them are grades of dignity with their Lord, and forgiveness and a generous provision (Paradise)” [al-Anfaal 8:2-4]
It should be noted that faith increases when one obeys Allah and decreases when one disobeys Him, so continue to do that which Allah has enjoined, such as observing the five daily prayers in congregation in the mosque and paying zakaah (the poor-due) willingly, to purify yourself of sin, and as an act of mercy towards the poor and needy. 
Keep company with good and righteous people so that they can help you to apply sharee’ah (religious teachings)and guide you towards that which will bring you happiness in this world and in the Hereafter. 
Keep away from the people of innovation and sin, lest they tempt you and weaken your resolve. 
Do a lot of naafil (voluntary) good deeds, and turn to Allah and ask Him for guidance. 
If you do these things, Allah will increase you in faith and help you to catch up with what you have missed of good deeds, and make you more steadfast in adhering to Islam.","Al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 3/187"
9083,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9083,Ruling on smoking and chewing tobacco,Is smooking permitted in islam? And is chewing of tobacco permitted in islam.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Smoking is haraam, because it is evil and 
          because it causes a great deal of harm. Allaah has permitted to His 
          slaves only good kinds of food and drink, and He has forbidden the bad 
          kinds. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“he allows them as lawful At Tayyibaat (i.e. all good 
          and lawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods), and 
          prohibits them as unlawful Al Khabaa’ith (i.e. all evil and unlawful 
          as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods)”[al-A’raaf 7:157]  
          
All forms of smoking are kinds of khabaa’ith (evil 
          and unlawful things), and they include harmful and intoxicating substances. 
          It is haraam to deal with it in any way, whether one inhales it, chews 
          it or deals with it in any of its other forms. It is obligatory upon 
          every Muslim to give up these things and to hasten to repent to Allaah, 
          and to regret having committed this sin, and to resolve never to go 
          back to it. May Allaah help us and you to do all that is good.","Fataawa Islamiyyah, 3/442"

And what is the difference between makruh and haram?,"Makruh means that which the Lawgiver asks us not to do, but not in a definitive manner. Haram means that which the Lawgiver requires us not to do, in a definitive manner.","Meaning of makruh


Meaning of haram","Praise be to Allah.Meaning of makruh
Makruh in Arabic means the opposite of liked or loved. 
In the terminology of shari’ah , makruh means that which the Lawgiver asks us not to do, but not in a definitive manner. It may be said that it means that for which the person who does not do it out of obedience will be rewarded, but the one who does it will not be punished. 
Meaning of haram
Haram in Arabic means forbidden. 
In the terminology of shari’ah, haram means that which the Lawgiver requires us not to do, in a definitive manner. Haram is the opposite of halal (permitted). A person will be rewarded for not doing that which is haram, if he does so out of obedience, and not out of fear, shyness or the inability to do it; in those cases he will not be rewarded for not doing it.

9089,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9089,It is not permissible to burn the body of the deceased after death,I am a recent convert to Islam.  It was somewhat of a tradition in my family to get cremated.  I always had that in my head that this was the best thing to do for the environment of the earth.  Can you please tell me if this is allowed in Islam?  Thank-you very much for your time.,,,"Praise be to Allah.It must be noted that the teachings and laws of Islam 
          came to honour people. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  
          
“And indeed We have honoured the 
          Children of Adam” [al-Israa’ 17:70]
 As the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was the one who conveyed 
          to us the laws of our Lord, he taught us what Allaah has prescribed 
          concerning the dead, what we are permitted to do in their case and what 
          we are not permitted to do. Hence the teachings of Islam are different 
          from the teachings of other nations; they include treating the deceased 
          with respect and in a manner that will benefit him. Allaah has prescribed 
          for us that when a Muslim dies, we should wash him and cleanse him, 
          then shroud him in a white cloth, then we should offer the funeral prayer 
          for him and pray for mercy and forgiveness for him. Then after that 
          we must bury him and cover him with earth, then we should visit the 
          graves and pray for their Muslim occupants. It is not prescribed in 
          Islam to burn or cremate the dead, rather this is an act of disrespect 
          and dishonour. Islam forbids us to step, walk or sit on the grave of 
          the deceased, so how could we burn him? Even non-Muslims are to be buried 
          according to Islam, and this is what the Muslims do in the case of kuffaar 
          who die in their countries, but the kuffaar are not buried with the 
          Muslims in the same place. Some of the kuffaar may burn their dead because 
          they do not believe in the Last Day. For this reason it is not permitted 
          to burn the dead; rather it is obligatory to bury the dead. And Allaah 
          knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
9098,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9098,Ruling on leaving a tattoo on the body or a gold tooth after finding out that it is haraam,"What is the ruling on leaving a tattoo on the body after finding out that it is haraam? Also what about leaving a gold tooth which a Muslim had done when he was unaware (of the ruling), but if he has it removed after knowing that it is haraam, it will leave a gap in his mouth?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Please note that tattoos on the body are 
          haraam, because it was reported that the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed the one who makes 
          hair extensions and the one who asks for that to be done, and the one 
          who does tattoos and the one who asks for them to be done. If a Muslim 
          does that when he is unaware of the fact that it is haraam, or that 
          is done to him when he is a child, then he has to remove it when he 
          comes to know that it is haraam. But if removing it is too difficult 
          or will cause him harm, then it is sufficient for him to repent and 
          seek forgiveness, and it will not matter if he leaves the mark on his 
          body. With regard to having a gold tooth fitted when it is not needed, 
          this is not permissible, because gold is haraam for men, unless there 
          it is necessary for some valid reason. I understood from your question 
          that you did that for the purpose of beautification, so you have to 
          remove it. You can have it replaced with something else that is made 
          of permissible material, other than gold. May Allaah help us all to 
          do that which pleases Him. Wa’l-salaamu ‘alaykum wa rahmat-Allaah wa
