47405,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47405,He is in love with a girl and wants to marry her,"I am a young man, I pray and have memorized the Qur’aan, praise be to Allaah. But I got to know a girl over the phone and our relationship began over the phone, then we met, but no evil action took place between us, praise be to Allaah. Then I advised her to pray regularly and memorize Qur’aan, and stop listening to songs, and that the basis of our relationship should be love of Allaah, may He be exalted, then love of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), then the love that exists between us. 

I found that she responded and began to pray regularly and read Qur’aan, and she stopped listening to songs. Then we ended our phone relationship and she said that she will wait for me, in sha Allaah. 

Now I am hesitating. Should I propose marriage to her, despite what we hear of the bad effects of such relationships on the stability of married life afterwards? 

Or should I cut off the relationship with her completely, even though I am in love with her and we have agreed to live our lives in accordance with that which pleases Allaah? We have decided that our life together will start with a visit to the House of Allaah once we are married, in sha Allaah.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
      People keep coming up with false justification for wrong 
      deeds and the Shaytaan encourages them to do that and makes people’s deeds 
      appear attractive to them, approaching each person in the manner that is 
      appropriate to him. So he pushes the lazy person further into negligence, 
      and with one who is resolved and ambitious he pushes him towards 
      exaggeration and extremism. He is always causing trouble to people. This 
      is what Allaah has decreed in this world. 

    The same applies to relationships between people, especially 
    a relationship between a man and a non-mahram woman. The accursed one (the 
    Shaytaan) tempts the one who seeks beauty and makes a particular woman seem 
    beautiful to him until he is trapped and in his eyes she becomes the most 
    beautiful of women, although she may be one of the least beautiful. 
    Similarly in the case of one who prays or has memorized the Qur’aan, if the 
    Shaytaan is not able to make him fall into the trap of forbidden 
    relationships with women because his religious commitment protects him and 
    makes him reluctant to behave like the immoral people, then the Shaytaan 
    uses the idea of love for the sake of Allaah and brotherly/sisterly 
    relationships among Muslims, and calling people to Allaah with wisdom and 
    beautiful preaching.  
We do not know whether 
    you need us to tell you that you have ignored the doors which the laws of 
    Allaah have opened for you to meet your needs and have entered the houses 
    from the back. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “It is not Al‑Birr (piety, righteousness) that you enter 
    the houses from the back” [al-Baqarah 2:189]

    You should not need to be told this. 

    Do you need us to tell you that a mere meeting between a man 
    and a non-mahram woman is an evil action of which Allaah and His Messenger 
    do not approve, because it involves being alone with a member of the 
    opposite sex, which is haraam, and entering upon women, and looking at them 
    in haraam ways. 

    Even if it did not involve the evil action to which you 
    refer, then just as there are degrees of righteous deeds, so too following 
    the footsteps of the Shaytaan of the Shaytaan varies in wickedness.  

    You – since you pray and have memorized the Qur’aan – should 
    not need to be told this. 

    If you had asked us before you went ahead and followed in 
    those footsteps, as you should have done, we would have said to you: What do 
    you have to do with undisciplined girl? No one would accept a girl who is 
    astray except one who is himself astray. Forget about her, and if you cannot 
    keep the wolves away from her then do not be a wolf yourself, until her Lord 
    bestows His kindness upon her and enables her to repent to Him and helps her 
    by means of her mahrams or other women who can guide her to the right way. 

    But what has happened has happened, and praise be to Allaah 
    Who has concealed you both and that nothing has happened between you of what 
    usually happens in such relationships. Praise be to Allaah that He has 
    enabled you to end this relationship, but you should complete that by 
    repenting to Allaah from what you have done and foiling the traps of the 
    Shaytaan that he has set up to ensnare you and stir up the flames of desire 
    and sin in your hearts. We ask Allaah bless us and you with acceptance. 

    If you do that, and take measures to set things straight 
    between you, and you give up the evil actions that you did before, then pray 
    istikhaarah to Allaah concerning the marriage that you seek. Perhaps this 
    step may be a confirmation of following the path of success. 

    “So enter houses through their proper doors, and fear 
    Allaah that you may be successful”

    [al-Baqarah 2:189]
But you – and she – 
    should both try to find out about each other’s lives – before this mistake – 
    find out about each party’s behaviour and attitude and the way the families 
    live, as is usually done by anyone who wishes to propose marriage. If it 
    turns out that what happened between you of meeting and getting to know one 
    another in a manner that is not approved of in sharee’ah, and Allaah 
    protected you from it being any worse than that, then go ahead and get 
    married as soon as possible. 

    Yes, the beginning was a mistake, but it is not wise, nor is 
    it prescribed in sharee’ah, to forsake a drowning man when we are able to 
    save him, on the grounds that he is the one who took the risk and set out to 
    travel by sea. 

    Warning against evil and telling people not to do it is one 
    thing, and dealing with mistakes and those who have deviated from the path 
    is something else. The people of the Sunnah, as Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah 
    (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, know what is right and what is wrong, 
    but at the same time they are compassionate towards people. 

    What we advise you to do is to marry his girl with whom you 
    are in love, after praying istikhaarah and asking Allaah for guidance. Pray 
    to Allaah and beseech Him to help you both to do that which Allaah loves and 
    is pleased with. It was narrated that Ibn 'Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased 
    with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) said: “We do not think that there is anything better for two 
    who love one another than marriage.” Narrated by Ibn Maajah, 1847. 
    al-Busayri said: Its men are thiqaat and its isnaad is saheeh.  

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    If Allaah has decreed that you should get married after that, 
    this is good, in sha Allaah. If He has not decreed that then that is also 
    good, in sha Allaah. 

    We also advise you to read question no.

47407,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47407,Using musical tunes on mobile phones,"Is there anything wrong with using mobile phones which play tunes, because these tunes are a kind of music, or not? In fact it is possible to avoid this problem by using a mobile telephone whose ringing tone is a verse of Qur’aan.",,,"Praise be to Allah.haraam, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stated that musical instruments are haraam when he said: “There will be among my ummah people who will regard as permissible adultery, silk, alcohol and musical instruments…” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5590. 
This hadeeth indicates that musical instruments are haraam in two ways. Firstly, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said “they will regard as permissible,” which clearly indicates that the things mentioned – including musical instruments – are forbidden in sharee’ah but those people will regard them as permissible.  Secondly, musical instruments are mentioned alongside things which are definitively forbidden, namely adultery and alcohol. If they were not haraam, they would not be mentioned alongside these things. (al-Silsilah al-Saheehah by al-Albaani, 1/140-141). 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: This hadeeth indicates that musical instruments are haraam. (Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 11/535). 
It is possible to do without these haraam tunes by setting the phone to ring with an ordinary tone, or something else that is not regarded as a musical tune. 
The Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas was asked about the ruling on musical tunes on mobile phones. They replied:  
It is not permissible to use musical tunes for telephones or any other devices, because listening to musical instruments is haraam, as is indicated by the evidence of sharee’ah. It is possible to do without them by using the ordinary ringing tone. And Allaah is the Source of strength. 
Majallat al-Da’wah, issue no. 1790, p. 42. 
The questioner mentioned that it is possible to set the ringing tone as a verse of Qur’aan, but it is better not to do that, because there is the fear that this may be a kind of disrespect towards the Holy Qur’aan. Allaah revealed the Qur’aan to be a Book of guidance showing the right way, to be recited and pondered and acted upon, not to be a means of alerting people. It is sufficient for the questioner to set his phone to an ordinary ringing tone. And Allaah knows best.",Islam Q&A
47425,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47425,The best way to call those who do not pray and to deal with innovators,What is the best way to call those who do not pray? What about innovators?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
We should consider the person being called to pray or to do other acts of worship, and pay attention to the most effective means of encouraging him or warning him. The general principle in Islam is to combine both approaches (encouraging and warning). It is also important to pay attention to how receptive or otherwise the person being called is, and whether he will be influences or put off by preaching. 
Secondly:  
The best way to call those who do not pray can be summed up as follows:  
1 – Reminding them of the obligation of prayer and that it is the greatest of the pillars of Islam after the Shahaadatayn (twin declaration of faith). 
2 – Telling them some of the virtues of prayer, for it is the best of the duties that Allaah has enjoined on His slaves, and the best way by means of which a person may draw closer to his Lord. It is the first of his religious affairs for which a person will be brought to account. The five daily prayers are an expiation for whatever sins come in between them, so long as he avoids major sins. A single prostration raises a person in status by one degree, and erases one sin… and there are other virtues of prayer that have been narrated. This may open his heart and perhaps prayer may become a source of delight, as it was for the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).  
3 – Telling them of the stern warnings that have been narrated concerning not praying, and the different opinions of the scholars as to whether this constitutes kufr (disbelief) and riddah (apostasy). Islam does not give the one who does not pray the opportunity to live freely among people, because in his case he must he invited to pray, and if he persists in not praying, he is to be executed as an apostate according to the view of Ahmad and those who agreed with him among the salaf (early generations of Islam); or he is to be executed as a hadd punishment, according to the view of Maalik and al-Shaafa’i; or he is to be detained and imprisoned, according to the view of Abu Haneefah.  But no scholar says that he is to be left free. So it should be said to the one who does not pray: are you happy that the scholars disagreed as to whether you are a kaafir and whether you should be killed or imprisoned? 
4 – Reminding them of the meeting with Allaah, death and the grave, and what will happen to the one who does not pray, namely a bad end and the torment of the grave. 
5 – Explaining that delaying prayer until the time for it is over is a major sin: 
“Then, there has succeeded them a posterity who have given up As-Salaah (the prayers) [i.e. made their Salaah (prayers) to be lost, either by not offering them or by not offering them perfectly or by not offering them in their proper fixed times] and have followed lusts. So they will be thrown in Hell”
[Maryam 19:59 – interpretation of the meaning].
Ibn Mas’ood said concerning al-Ghayy (translated here as “Hell”): it is a valley in Hell that is very deep and has a foul taste. 
And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So woe unto those performers of Salaah (prayers) (hypocrites),
5. Those who delay their Salaah (prayer from their stated fixed times)”
[al-Ma’oon 107:4-5]
6 – Explaining the serious implications of the view that they are kaafirs, such as their marriages being rendered invalid, it being forbidden for them to remain with and be intimate with their wives, and the fact that they will not be washed and prayed for after they die. Among the texts that indicate that the one who does not pray is a kaafir is the hadeeth in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Between a man and shirk and kufr there stands his giving up prayer.” Narrated by Muslim, 82. and he said: “The covenant that stands between us and them is prayer; whoever gives it up is a kaafir.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2621; al-Nasaa’i, 463; Ibn Maajah, 1079. 
7 – Giving them some booklets and tapes that deal with the subject of prayer and the punishment of the one who does not pray or is careless concerning the prayer. 
8 – Forsaking and shunning them if they persist in not praying. 
With regard to innovators, the way in which we deal with them varies according to the type of innovation involved. We should advise them and call them to Allaah, and establish proof against them, and refute their specious arguments. If the innovator persists in his innovation he should be forsaken and shunned, if it is thought that this will most likely benefit him. We have first to be sure that a person is an innovator before resorting to these measures, and reference should be made to the scholars. We should differentiate between the innovation and the one who practices it, because he may have the excuse of ignorance or misunderstanding.

47431,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47431,What Is Sufism?,What is Sufism (tasawwuf) about? Is the “Da’wah and Tabligh” group one of the misguided groups?,"1- The words “Tasawwuf” and “Sufism” are modern terms which refer to something that is not automatically approved of in the Shari’ah neither is it automatically condemned.
2- Jama'at al-Tabligh is one of the groups that is active in the field of da’wah, calling people to Allah. They do a great deal of good and make commendable efforts. But this group is not free of some innovations in knowledge and action. For more about Sufism and Jama'at al-Tabligh, see the detailed answer","What is Sufism (Tasawwuf)?


Sufism nowadays


What is Jama'at al-Tabigh?","Praise be to Allah.What is Sufism (Tasawwuf)?
It is important for us to understand, firstly, that the words “Tasawwuf” and “Sufism” are modern terms which refer to something that is not automatically approved of in the Shari’ah as the words imaan (faith), Islam and ihsan are. Neither is it automatically condemned like the words kufr, fusuq (immorality) and ‘isyan (disobedience, sin).  
In such cases, we need to find out more about what is meant by such words before we can pass a comment. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“The words al-faqr and al-tasawwuf (i.e., Sufism ) may include some things that are loved by Alaah and His Messenger, and these are things that are enjoined even if they are called faqr or tasawwuf, because the Quran and Sunnah indicate that they are mustahabb and that is not altered if they are called by other names. 
That also includes actions of the heart such as repentance and patience. And it may include things that are hated by Allah and His Messenger, such as some kinds of belief in incarnation and pantheism, or monasticism that has been innovated in Islam, or things that go against shari’ah and have been innovated, and so on. 
These things are forbidden no matter what names they are given… And it may include limiting oneself to a certain style of clothing or certain customs, ways of speaking and behaving, in such a way that anyone who goes beyond it is regarded as an outsider, although this is not something that has been stipulated in the Quran or Sunnah; rather it may be something that is permissible or it may be something that is makruh, and this is a bid’ah that is forbidden. 
This is not the way of the friends of Allah (awliya Allah); such things are innovations and misguidance that exist among those who claim to follow the Sufi path. 
Similarly, among those who claim to be servants of knowledge there are innovations that involve beliefs and words that go against the Quran and Sunnah, using phrases and terminology that have no basis in shari’ah. Many such things happen among those people. 
The wise believer agrees with all people in that in which they are in accordance with the Quran and Sunnah and obey Allah and His Messenger, but he does not agree with that in which they go against the Quran and Sunnah and disobey Allah and His Messenger.
He accepts from every group that which was taught by the Messenger… when a person seeks the truth and justice, based on knowledge, he is one of the successful friends of Allah and His victorious party…” (Al-Fatawa, 11/280-290)
Sufism nowadays
But what Shaykh al-Islam said about the view of Sufis depending on their situation is almost too theoretical for our times, when the objectionable matters that he referred to have become part of the path of those who call themselves Sufis nowadays, in addition to the different occasions they celebrate such as the Mawlid, and their exaggeration about their living shaykhs, and their attachment to shrines and graves, where they pray and circumambulate the graves and make vows to them, and other well-known practices of theirs. 
Because of these matters, the correct approach now is to warn against them with no reservations. This is what was agreed upon by the Standing Committee in their answer to a question about the ruling on the Sufi tariqas that exist nowadays. They said: 
“Usually those that are called Sufis nowadays follow bid’ahs (innovations) that constitute shirk, as well as other kinds of bid’ah, such as when some of them say “Madad ya sayyid (Help, O Master)”, and call upon the qutubs (“holy men”), and recite dhikr in unison using names which Allah has not called Himself, like saying “Huw, Huw (He, He)” and “Ah, Ah (a contraction of the word ‘Allah’)”. Whoever reads their books will be aware of many of their innovations that constitute shirk, and other evils.”
What is Jama'at al-Tabigh? 
With regard to the Jama'at al-Tabligh , this is one of the groups that is active in the field of da’wah, calling people to Allah. They do a great deal of good and make commendable efforts. How many sinners have repented at their hands, and how many have now become devoted to worship of Allah! 
But this group is not free of some innovations in knowledge and action, to which the scholars have drawn attention. But whatever the case they cannot be described as being one of the misguided groups. We have quoted above the words of Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah:  
“The wise believer agrees with all people in that in which they are in accordance with the Quran and Sunnah and obey Allah and His Messenger, but he does not agree with that in which they go against the Quran and Sunnah.”

My family forced me to marry him. My problem is that I do not want to have children from him. Is it permissible for me to pray to Allaah not to give me children from him, or is that not permitted? I have read that it is not permissible to use contraceptive pills without the husband’s permission. Is this true?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for the guardian, whether he is the father or anyone else, to marry off anyone under his care without her consent, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “A previously-married woman has more right concerning herself than her guardian, and the permission of a virgin should be sought (regarding marriage), and her permission is her silence.” Narrated by Muslim, 1421. 
It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No previously-married woman should be married off without being consulted, and no virgin should be married off without asking her permission.” They said: “O Messenger of Allaah, what is her permission?” He said: “If she remains silent.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4843; Muslim, 1419. 
Similarly, it is not permissible for a guardian to be stubborn about the marriage of a female under his care, or to prevent her from marrying someone she wants to marry if he is compatible with her. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If there comes to you one with whose religious commitment and character you are pleased, then marry (your female relative under your care) to him, for if you do not do that there will be fitnah (tribulation) in the land and much corruption.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1084; classed as hasan by al-Albaani. See also question no. 32580. 
With regard to what has happened to you, you have the choice of whether to stay or not. Seek guidance from Allaah (by praying istikhaarah). If you agree to stay in this marriage then all well and good, but if you do not accept to stay with your husband, then you have the right to seek annulment of the marriage, because it took place without your consent. 
It was narrated from Khansa’ bint Khizaam al-Ansaariyyah that her father married her off when she had been previously married, and she did not like that. She went to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and he annulled the marriage. Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4845. And it was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) that a virgin girl came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and told him that her father had married her off against her objections. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) gave her the choice. Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2096; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani. 
The majority of scholars are of the view that if a woman is married off without her consent, then the marriage contract is invalid, because it is a forbidden contract which cannot be validated. This is the view of the Shaafa’is and Hanbalis. 
The view of the Hanafis, which was also narrated in one report from Ahmad, is that the contract is dependent upon the woman’s acceptance. If she gives her consent then it is valid, otherwise she may annul it.
 See al-Mughni, 7/364; Fath al-Baari, 9/194 
But so long as the court is in charge of marriages, it is better to refer such matters to the court. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, concerning the matter of a father forcing his daughter to marry: It is haraam for a man to force his daughter to marry a man whom she does not want to marry, and what is haraam cannot be validated or implemented, because implementing it or validating it goes against the prohibition that has been narrated.  When sharee’ah forbids a matter, then we should not be involved in it or do it. If we validate it, that means that we have becomes involved in it and done it, and we have made it equivalent to the contracts that are permitted in sharee’ah. 
Based on this, the correct view is that the marriage arranged by the father to a man whom his daughter does not want as a husband is an invalid marriage, and the contract is invalid, and should be examined by the court. 
See al-Fataawa, p. 760; see also Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Ibraaheem, 10/73-78 
With regard to your taking contraceptive pills without your husband’s knowledge, this is not a solution to the problem, because this means that you are staying with one whom you do not like. As stated in the fatwa of Shaykh Ibn Ibraaheem mentioned above, some of the scholars have stated that if a women shows that she accepts her marriage to someone to whom she was married by force, then she forfeits the right to seek annulment of the marriage. If she forfeits the right to seek annulment, then the man becomes a legitimate husband to her. If that is the case, then it is not permissible for you to take contraceptive pills without his knowledge, if there is a need for that.

He replied: 
It is haraam for women to attend funerals because they have little patience and because it exposes them to fitnah and mixing with men. With regard to wearing black clothes at times of calamity, this is an innovation. 
Majmoo’ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 17/329. 
He was also asked (17/410): what is the ruling on singling out certain kinds of clothes for offering condolences such as women wearing black? 
He replied: 
Singling out a certain type of clothes for offering condolences is an innovation as far as we know, and it may stem from a person’s being displeased with the decree of Allah. Although some people think there is nothing wrong with it, the salaf did not do this and as it is to some extent an expression of displeasure with the decree of Allah, undoubtedly it is better not to do it, because if a person does that he may be closer to sin than not. 
He also said (17/414): 
Wearing black in mourning for the dead is a kind of bid’ah and displaying grief, and it is akin to rending one’s garment and slapping one’s cheeks, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) disavowed the one who does that when he said: “He is not one of us who rends his garment and slaps his cheeks and calls out with the call of jaahiliyyah.”.",Islam Q&A
