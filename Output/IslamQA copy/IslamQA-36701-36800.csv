Abu Dawood, al-Tirmidhi and al-Nasaa’i, and by al-Bukhaari in al-Adab al-Mufrad from Abu Hurayrah. Slaughtering a sacrifice on his behalf is a kind of ongoing charity, because it benefits the person offering the sacrifice, the deceased person, and others.

36721,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/36721,A traveler knows that he will come back tomorrow – is it permissible for him not to fast?,"My question is about fasting and , I have to travel in the holly month of Ramadan from one state to the other (distance is more that 800 miles). Following the Sonnah of Profit Mohammad (Peace be up on him), I could break my fasting that day leaving my home state by 4:00 AM to make it to the destination state by 9:15 AM. I’m flying back the second day to my home state on a flight that will leave by 2:30 PM after a full day of work. Am I allowed to break my fasting that day considering that flying back to my home? If yes, am I supposed to break my fasting in the morning of that day or only thru my travel after 2:30 PM? Please explain this to me.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly : 

    Yes, you may not fast on the day on which you know you will 
    be returning to your family. 

    The scholars differed as to whether it is permissible for a 
    traveler not to fast if he knows that he will come back the next day. The 
    majority of scholars (including Imam Abu Haneefah, Imam Maalik and Imam 
    al-Shaafa’i – may Allaah have mercy on them) were of the view that it is 
    permissible for him not to fast, because he is traveling and so is included 
    in the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “and whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number [of 
    days which one did not observe Sawm (fasts) must be made up] from other 
    days”

    [al-Baqarah 2:185]
Imam Ahmad (may Allaah 
    have mercy on him) was of the view that he has to fast. 

    Ibn Muflih said in al-Furoo’ (3/24): 
If the traveler knows 
    that he will be coming back the next day, then he has to fast… and it was 
    said that it is mustahabb, in accordance with the three imams (Abu Haneefah, 
    Maalik and al-Shaafa’i), because there is a reason for a concession 
    (allowing him not to fast). 

    See also al-Insaaf by al-Mirdaawi, 7/362. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’ 
    (6/210): 
If the traveler knows 
    that he will be coming back the next day, then he has to refrain from eating 
    and drinking etc. This is the view (of Imam Ahmad). The correct view is that 
    he does not have to refrain from eating and drinking. 

    Secondly: 

    With regard to the time of breaking your fast, you can break 
    the fast at any time you wish so long as you are traveling, until you go 
    back to your city. If you go back fasting then you have to complete your 
    fast and it is haraam for you to break your fast in that case, because you 
    no longer come under the heading of a traveler.  

    See al-Majmoo’, 6/173. 

    If you go back not fasting, then there is a difference of 
    scholarly opinion as to whether you are obliged to refrain from eating and 
    drinking or not.

    we have already stated that it is not obligatory to refrain from eating and

But he can be intimate by kissing, embracing, touching etc., parts that are above the navel and below the knee. Scholars differed on being intimate with regard to the area between the navel and the knee, apart from the front or back passage.",,"Praise be to Allah.A man can be intimate with his wife when she is menstruating or in nifas ; this falls into three categories: 

Being intimate and having intercourse with her in the vagina. This is haram according to the consensus of the Muslims and the text of the Quran. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“They ask you concerning menstruation. Say: that is an adha (a harmful thing for a husband to have a sexual intercourse with his wife while she is having her menses), therefore, keep away from women during menses and go not unto them till they are purified (from menses and have taken a bath).” [Al-Baqarah 2:222] 

Being intimate by kissing, embracing, touching etc. parts that are above the navel and below the knee. This is permissible according to scholarly consensus. (See Sharh Muslim by al-Nawawi, and al-Mughni, 1/414 )
Being intimate with regard to the area between the navel and the knee, apart from the front or back passage. The scholars differed as to whether this is permissible. Imam Abu Hanifah, Imam Malik and al-Shafi`i were of the view that this is haram, and Imam Ahmad was of the view that this is permissible; the latter view was also shared by some Hanafis, Malikis and Shafi`is. Al-Nawawi said: “The evidence for this view is stronger and it is the preferred view.” 

Those who say that it is permissible quoted evidence from the Quran and Sunnah. 
With regard to Quranic evidence, they quoted the verse mentioned above (interpretation of the meaning): 
“…therefore, keep away from women during menses and go not unto them till they are purified (from menses and have taken a bath).” [Al-Baqarah 2:222] 
The phrase fi’l-mahid (translated as during menses) refers to both the time of menstruation and the site of menstruation, which is the vagina. So long as the woman is menstruating, having intercourse with her in the vagina is haram. 
Ibn Qudamah said in al-Mughni, 1/415: 
“The fact that the site of bleeding is mentioned specifically indicates that it is permissible to be intimate in other areas.” 
With regard to the Sunnah, Muslim (302) narrated from Anas that the Jews, if any of their women was menstruating, would not eat with them or meet with them in their houses. The Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about that, then Allah revealed the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“They ask you concerning menstruation. Say: that is an adha (a harmful thing for a husband to have a sexual intercourse with his wife while she is having her menses), therefore, keep away from women during menses and go not unto them till they are purified (from menses and have taken a bath). And when they have purified themselves, then go in unto them as Allah has ordained for you (go in unto them in any manner as long as it is in their vagina). Truly, Allah loves those who turn unto Him in repentance and loves those who purify themselves.” [Al-Baqarah 2:222] 
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “So do everything except intercourse.” News of that reached the Jews and they said, “What does this man want? He does not leave any of our affairs but he differs from it!” 
What is meant by “they would not meet with them in their houses” is that they would not mix with them or stay in the same room with them. This was the view of al-Nawawi. 
Abu Dawud (272) narrated from `Ikrimah from one of the wives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wanted to engage in any intimacy with one of his wives when she was menstruating, he would put a piece of cloth over her private part. Al-Hafiz said: “Its isnad is strong; it was classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud, 242.” 
It says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 5/395: 
“It is haram for the husband to have intercourse with his wife in her vagina when she is menstruating , but he may be intimate with her everywhere else.” 
It is better for the man, if he wants to be intimate with his wife when she is menstruating, to tell her to wear something to cover her between the navel and the knees, then he may be intimate with her in any other area. 
Al-Bukhari (302) and Muslim (2293) narrated that ‘Aishah said: “If one of us was menstruating and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wanted to be intimate with her, he would tell her to wear an izar (waist wrapper) at the peak of her menstruation, then he would be intimate with her.” 
Muslim (294) narrated that Maymunah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would be intimate with his wives above the izar (waist wrapper) when they were menstruating. 
“The peak of her menstruation” means at the beginning when the flow is heaviest. This was the view of al-Khattabi. 
Ibn al-Qayyim said in Tahdhib al-Sunan, commenting on hadith no. 2167 from ‘Awn al-Ma’bud: 
“The hadith “Do everything except intercourse” clearly indicates that what is forbidden is only intercourse in the site of menstruation, which is intercourse in the vagina, but everything else is permissible. The hadiths which speak about the izar (waist wrapper) do not contradict that, because that is a precautionary measure and is better.”
It may be that a distinction is made between the beginning of the period and the end, so that it is mustahabb to cover the area between the navel and the knee when the bleeding is heaviest, which is at the beginning of the period. 
Al-Hafiz said: 
“This is supported by the hadith narrated by Ibn Majah with a hasan isnad from Umm Salamah, that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would avoid intimacy with her for three (days), then he would be intimate with her after that.”  
It should be noted that the rulings mentioned above apply to both menstruating women and women in nifas (bleeding after childbirth). 
Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said, after mentioning the rulings on a man being intimate with his wife when she is menstruating: 
“The woman in nifas is like the woman who is menstruating in this regard.” (Al-Mughni, 1/419)

They eat carrion and filthy things. But there is a kind of crow that eats only seeds and pure things, so it is halaal. It is smaller than the well-known black crow. 
As for foxes, they have fangs and hunt other animals, and they eat impure things, so they are haram. Those who say that they are makrooh think that they are makrooh to the point of being forbidden. 
As for eagles, they have talons, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade every bird that has talons. This includes birds that eat what they can carry in their talons, or they use them for hunting, like eagles, sparrow hawks, falcons, hawks, etc. And because they also eat carrion and feed on filth, they are all haram. 
With regard to gazelles, they are halaal according to scholarly consensus, because they are game that avoid contact with humans. The Sahaabah said that a fidyah (ransom) is to be paid by those who kill them in the Haram or when in ihraam, which indicates that they are permissible.

36734,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/36734,How to Expiate for Swearing by Allah and Lying,"Unfortunately since I was small I have had the habit of swearing by Allah whether I am telling the truth or not. I have tried to give up this bad habit and I believe that I am now following the right path. My question is: what is the ruling on the oaths I have sworn in the past? What should I do so that Allah will forgive me? Should I offer expiation for each oath? But the problem is that I cannot know how many oaths I swore. Please advise me, may Allah reward you with good.","With regard to oaths that you swore falsely saying that you did something in the past or did not do it, and you were lying, there is no expiation to be offered, but you have to repent to Allah.",,"Praise be to Allah.Oaths are of three types: 

A binding oath . This is an oath which a person means and is sure about, referring to something in the future which he resolves to do or not do. The ruling on this is that expiation is obligatory if the oath is broken.

Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Whoever swears to do something and he does not do it, or he swears not to do something and he does it, must offer expiation.” There is no difference of opinion concerning this matter among the jurists. Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said: The vow for which expiation is due, according to the consensus of the Muslims, is that concerning actions in the future.” (Al-Mughni, 9/390) 

Unintentional oaths. This refers to swearing when there was no intention of making an oath. No expiation is due on such oaths , because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“Allah will not call you to account for that which is unintentional in your oaths, but He will call you to account for that which your hearts have earned. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most-Forbearing.” [Al-Baqarah 2:225]
`Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: This verse, ‘Allah will not call you to account for that which is unintentional in your oaths’, was revealed concerning saying, “No, by Allah’ and “Yes, by Allah.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 4613) 
Whoever swears to something thinking that it is as he has sworn it to be, then finds out that it is otherwise, does not have to offer expiation according to the majority of scholars. This comes under the heading of unintentional oaths. 
Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Whoever swears to something thinking that it is as he has sworn it to be, when that is not the case, does not have to offer expiation, because this is a kind of unintentional oath. Most of the scholars are of the view that no expiation is required for this kind of oath. Ibn al-Mundhir said: This was narrated from Ibn 'Abbas, Abu Hurayrah, Abu Malik, Zurarah ibn Awfa, al-Hasan, al-Nakha’i, Malik, Abu Hanifah and al-Thawri. 
Those who said that this is an unintentional oath were: Mujahid, Sulayman ibn Yasar, al-Awza’i, al-Thawri and Abu Hanifah and his companions. 
Most of the scholars are of the view that no expiation is required for an unintentional oath. Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said: the Muslims are unanimously agreed on that. 
That is because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Allah will not call you to account for that which is unintentional in your oaths.” [Al-Baqarah 2:225] This comes under that heading, because he did not intend to give a wrong impression, so it is as if he broke the oath by mistake. (Al-Mughni, 9/393) 

Swearing falsely concerning something that is in the past. This is a major sin, and there is no expiation for it according to the majority of scholars because it is too serious to be expiated. 

If this is understood, then if the oaths that you swore were binding oaths that you broke, so you have to offer expiation. 
If you have forgotten how many oaths there were, then do your best to remember and offer expiation based on what you think is most likely to be the case, then you will have absolved yourself. 
Whatever of these oaths had to do with doing a certain action, or refraining from a certain action, only one expiation is required in each case. For example, if you swore that you would not speak to So and So, then you broke that oath and did not offer expiation, then you swore again not to speak to him, and you broke the oath again, you only have to offer expiation once. This is different from the case if you had sworn not to speak to him, then you swore not to eat his food, for example. In that case you would have to offer expiation twice. We have already discussed this in detail in the answer to question no. 34730 .  
To sum up, with regard to the oaths that you swore to do something or not to do something in the future, and you broke them, you have to offer expiation for them. 
With regard to oaths that you swore falsely saying that you did something in the past or did not do it, and you were lying, there is no expiation to be offered, but you have to repent to Allah, and Allah accepts the repentance of those who repent.  May Allah help you and forgive your sin.

This is the well-known view of Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him). This is indicated by a number of things: 

The basic principle is that things do not break Wudu, and there is no authentic evidence to suggest that Wudu is invalidated by drinking camel's milk. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told some people who came to Madinah and got sick to drink camel's urine and milk. (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 233 and Muslim, 1671) If drinking their milk invalidates Wudu , the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would have told them about that. (See Al-Mughni, 1/245; Al-Insaf, 2/58; Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti`, 1/209)

They were classed as inauthentic by Al-Albani in Da`if Ibn Majah. 
Even if these Hadiths were authentic, the command mentioned therein could be understood as meaning that it is recommended to do Wudu after drinking camel's milk, so as to reconcile it with the Hadith quoted above.

If that is permissible and a person wipes over them, then takes off one layer and then breaks his wudoo’, is it permissible for him to wipe over the other or not?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    It is permissible for a person to wear two layers of khufoof 
    or socks. If he wipes over one – in cases where it is permissible to do so, 
    as we shall see below – then he takes one off, and breaks his wudoo’, it is 
    permissible for him to wipe over the other, according to the opinion of some 
    of the scholars. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) a number 
    of scenarios in which a person wears two layers of khufoof or socks, as 
    follows: 

    1 – If a person put on socks or khufoof then broke his 
    wudoo’, then put on another pair before doing wudoo’, the ruling applies to 
    the first layer, i.e., if he wants to wipe over them after that, he has to 
    wipe over the first layer, and it is not permissible for him to wipe over 
    the second layer. 

    2 – If he puts on socks or khufoof, then he breaks his wudoo’ 
    and wipes over them, then he puts on a second layer, then he may wipe over 
    the second layer according to the sound view. It says in al-Furoo’: 
    That is permissible according to Maalik. End quote. Al-Nawawi said: This is 
    the best view, because he put them on in a state of purity (tahaarah), and 
    their view that it is a lesser kind of purity is not acceptable. End quote. 

    If we accept that, then the period of wiping starts from the 
    first time he wiped over the first layer. 

    In this case he may also wipe over the first layer, without a 
    doubt. 

    3 – If he puts khufoof on over khufoof or socks, and he wipes 
    the outer layer then takes it off, can he wipe over the lower layer for the 
    remainder of the period? I did not see any clear statement on this, but 
    al-Nawawi stated that Abu’l-‘Abbaas ibn Surayj said that if he puts 
    overshoes over the khufoof then one of three scenarios must apply: one of 
    which is that they become like a single khuff, with the upper layer visible 
    and the second layer like a lining, therefore he may wipe over the lower 
    layer until the period for wiping ends from the time he wiped over the upper 
    layer, which is like the case when the outer surface of the khuff becomes 
    worn or scratched – it is permissible to wipe over the lining.” End quote 
    from Fataawa al-Tahaarah, p. 192 

    The “overshoe” (jurmooq) is something that is worn over the 
    regular khufoof, especially in cold countries.

Then if she becomes unable to stand or it is too difficult for her to stand, then she can sit down while praying.","How should sick people pray?


Can a pregnant woman pray sitting down?","Praise be to Allah.How should sick people pray?
The basic principle concerning the prayer of one who is sick is that he should do whatever he is able to of the essential parts of the prayer, and he does not have to do what he is unable to do. This is indicated by a great deal of evidence from the Quran and Sunnah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can” [At-Taghabun 64:16] 
“Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope” [Al-Baqarah 2:286]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If I command you to do a thing, then do as much of it as you can.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 7288 and Muslim, 1337) 
`Imran ibn Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I was suffering from haemorrhoids and I asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about praying. He said, ‘Pray standing, and if you cannot, then sitting down, and if you cannot, then lying on your side.’” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1117) 
Can a pregnant woman pray sitting down?
Based on the above, if you are able to pray standing up then you have to stand. Then if you become unable to stand or it is too difficult for you to stand, then you can sit down whilst praying. 
It is permissible to sit on a chair or on the ground, depending on what you are able to do and what is easy for you. But it is better to sit on the ground, because the Sunnah is for a person to sit cross-legged in the place where one would stand and bow, and this is not easy to do on a chair.  
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:  
“If a person cannot pray standing, he should pray sitting , but it is better to sit cross-legged in the place of standing and bowing.” (From his essay, Taharat Al-Marid wa Salatuhu)       
This sitting cross-legged is not obligatory; one may sit however he wants because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If he cannot then sitting,” and he did not explain how he should sit. (Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti`, 4/462) 
If it is too difficult for you to prostrate and bow, then you can lean forward and make the leaning for sujud deeper than that for Ruku`. 
If you can stand, then lean forward for Ruku` whilst standing, and lean forward for Sujud whilst sitting, then you should do that, because standing is closer to bowing than sitting, and sitting is closer to Sujud than standing. 
Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Whoever is able to stand but is unable to bow or prostrate is not relieved of the obligation to stand, rather he should pray standing up, then lean forward for Ruku` (i.e., whilst standing) then sit and lean forward for Sujud… and he should make leaning for Sujud deeper than that for Ruku`. If he is only unable to prostrate then he should do Ruku` and then lean forward for Sujud. 
If during the prayer the sick person becomes able to do something that he was unable to do, such as standing, sitting , bowing or prostrating, he should start to do that and continue from whatever he has already completed of his prayer.” (From his essay Ahkam Salat Al-Marid wa Taharatihi) 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Whoever is unable to bow should lean forward whilst standing, and whoever is not able to prostrate should lean forward whilst sitting .” (Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti’, 4/475)

I want to know to what level does a man listens to his wife?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Allaah says, enjoining kindness towards one's wife (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and live with them honourably”
[al-Nisa’ 4:19]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “And treat women with kindness, and treat women with kindness.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5186; Muslim, 1468. 
And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The best of you is the one who is best to his womenfolk, and I am the best of you to my womenfolk.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3895; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 3314. 
Undoubtedly consulting one's wife and listening to her advice and accepting it is part of living with them honourably and treating them with kindness. It softens her heart and makes her feel that she is playing a role in the family and that she is responsible for her family, especially if the man finds that his wife has wisdom and common sense, and has intuition, and she does not jump to conclusions or let herself be swayed by emotions. 
Moreover, the benefits to be gained by consulting one's wife and accepting her opinion, or not doing so, may vary according to the topic concerning which the wife is being consulted and asked for her opinion: is her emotional nature going to affect her view on this matter or not?
 It may also vary according to the nature of each of the spouses and how much wisdom and common sense each of them has. 
If the husband thinks that it makes sense to reject her opinion or he thinks that her view is mistaken, he has to be kind in the way in which he rejects her opinion or advice, and he should not accuse her of being silly or say that her opinion is worthless, and he should explain to her what is correct, as much as he can. 
Look at the story of al-Hudaybiyah and what happened there, then you will understand the value of consulting a wise and smart woman. When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) made a treaty with Quraysh and agreed to go back, and not enter Makkah that year, he said to his companions: “Get up and offer your sacrifices.” But not a single man among them got up, until he had said that three times. When no one got up, he entered upon Umm Salamah and told her what had happened with the people. Umm Salamah said: “O Prophet of Allaah, is that what you want? Go out and do not speak a word to any one of them until you have slaughtered your sacrifice and called your barber to shave your head.” When he did that, they got up and offered their sacrifices. 
Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: This points to the virtue of consultation, and that it is permissible to consult a virtuous wife. 
Also think about the story of Moosa, and how Allaah caused him to be raised in the house of Pharaoh, and how much blessing there was in the advice of Aasiya, the wife of Pharaoh (may Allaah be pleased with her), of whom Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And the wife of Fir‘awn (Pharaoh) said: ‘A comfort of the eye for me and for you. Kill him not, perhaps he may be of benefit to us, or we may adopt him as a son.’ And they perceived not (the result of that)”
[al-Qasas 28:9]
In the same soorah there is the story of the two women at the well of Midyan, and how one of them said to her father (interpretation of the meaning): 
“ ‘O my father! Hire him! Verily, the best of men for you to hire is the strong, the trustworthy’”

[al-Baqarah 2:224]
So do not swear oaths 
    except when necessary. The Muslim must protect his oath by offering 
    expiation if he wants to do something other than what he swore to do, 
    because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “By Allaah, if Allaah wills, I do not swear an oath and then see something

    al-Tirmidhi, Ibn Maajah and Imam Ahmad. 
With regard to numerous 
    oaths, if they all had to do with the same thing, then expiation only needs 
    to be offered once. For example, if you said, “By Allaah, I will not speak 
    to So and so,” and you said that many times, then you spoke to him, then you 
    only have to offer expiation once. 
But if you swore oaths 
    regarding several things, such as if you said, “By Allaah, I will not speak 
    to So and so,” then you spoke to him, and you said, “By Allaah, I will not 
    travel to such and such a place,” then you went there, and so on, then for 
    each oath you have to offer expiation. And you should try to be on the safe 
    side by offering expiation for whatever you think is most likely to be the 
    case, so that will have discharged your duty.

36755,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/36755,Conditions of Udhiyah,"I intend to offer a sacrifice on behalf of myself and my children. Are there any specific characteristics that the animal should have, or is it correct to sacrifice any sheep?",There are six conditions for the udhiyah: 1- It should be one of the an'am class of animals; 2- It should have reached the age stipulated in Shari’ah; 3- It should be free of any faults that would render it unsuitable for sacrifice; 4- The animal should belong to the person who is offering the sacrifice; 5- No one else should have any rights to the sacrificial animal; 6- It should be slaughtered at the time specified in Shari’ah,,"Praise be to Allah.There are six conditions for the udhiyah : 
1. It should be one of the an'am class of animals, which are: camels, cattle, sheep and goats, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And for every nation We have appointed religious ceremonies, that they may mention the Name of Allah over the beast of cattle that He has given them for food.” [al-Hajj 22:34]
Bahimat al-an’am (translated here as “beast of cattle”) includes camels, cattle and sheep. This is what is well known among the Arabs, and this was the view of al-Hasan, Qatadah and others. 
2. It should have reached the age stipulated in Shari’ah, which is six months  for a sheep and the age at which the animal is considered to be an adult for any other animal, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not sacrifice anything but an adult animal, unless it is difficult for you, in which case you may slaughter a six-month old lamb (jadh’ah).” Narrated by Muslim. 
A mature animal means one that is considered to be an adult.  
In the case of camels, it means one that is five years old. 
For cattle, it means one that is two years old. 
For sheep it means one that is a year old. 
The jadh’ah is that which is half a year old. So it is not correct to sacrifice a camel, cow or goat that has not yet reached maturity, or a sheep that is less than six months old. 
3. It should be free of any faults that would render it unsuitable for sacrifice, of which there are four: 

An obvious defect in one eye, such as when the eye is sunken in its socket, or when it sticks out like a button, or is white and obviously defective. 
Obvious sickness, whose symptoms are clearly apparent in the animal, such as fever that prevents it from grazing and causes loss of appetite; mange that obviously affects its flesh or its health; deep wounds that affect its health, and so on. 
Obvious lameness, which prevents the animal from walking normally. 
Emaciation that leaves no marrow in the bones, when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was asked about what should be avoided in udhiyah, he gestured with his hand and said: “Four: a lame animal which is obviously lame, a one-eyed animal whose defect is obvious, a sick animal whose sickness is obvious, and an emaciated animal that no one would choose.” Narrated by Malik in al-Muwatta from the hadih of al-Bara ibn ‘Azib. According to a hadith narrated from him in al-Sunan, he said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stood up among us and said: ‘There are four which are not permissible for sacrifice,’” and he mentioned something similar. Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Irwa al-Ghalil, 1148. 

These four faults render an animal unsuitable for sacrifice, and they include similar faults or more severe faults. So the following animals are also unsuitable for sacrifice: 

One that is blind in both eyes.
One that has eaten more than it can stand, until the danger has passed.
One that has encountered difficulty in giving birth, until all danger has passed.
One that has suffered something that could kill it, such as strangulation or a fall from a high place, until the danger has passed.
One that is unable to walk because of a defect.
One that has had one of its forelegs or hind legs cut off.

If these are added to the four defects mentioned in the text, the number of those that cannot be offered as sacrifices reaches ten – these six and the four mentioned above. 
4. The animal should belong to the person who is offering the sacrifice, or he should have permission for that either on the grounds of shari’ah or from the owner. The sacrifice is not valid if the animal slaughtered does not belong to the person who is sacrificing it, such as one that has been taken by force, stolen, or taken on the basis of a false claim, etc, because it is not permissible to draw closer to Allah by means of sin. A sacrifice offered by the guardian of an orphan from the orphan’s property is valid if that is customary and if he feels sad about not offering a sacrifice. 
A sacrifice offered by a guardian from the property of the person under his care is valid, if done with permission. 
5. No one else should have any rights to the sacrificial animal; the sacrifice of an animal that is held in pledge is not valid. 
6. It should be slaughtered at the time specified in Shari’ah , which is from after the ‘Eid prayer on the Day of Sacrifice until sunset on the last of the days of al-Tashriq, which is the 13th of Dhu’l-Hijjah. So the days when the sacrifice may be offered are four: the day of ‘Eid after the prayer, and the three days after that. Whoever slaughters it before the ‘Eid prayer is over, or after sun sets on the 13th of Dhu’l-Hijjah, his sacrifice is not valid, because of the hadith narrated by al-Bukhari from al-Bara ibn ‘Azib (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever slaughters (his sacrifice) before the prayer, it is meat that he has brought to his family, but that is not the sacrifice.” And he narrated that Jundub ibn Sufyan al-Bajali (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saying, ‘Whoever slaughters the sacrifice before he prays, let him replace it with another.’” And it was narrated that Nubayshah al-Hadhali (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘The days of al-Tashriq are the days of eating, drinking and remembering Allah.’” Narrated by Muslim. 
But if he has an excuse for delaying it beyond the days of Tashriq, such as if the animal ran away, without there being any negligence on his part, and he could not find it until after the time was over, or he appointed someone else to slaughter it and that person forgot until the time was over, then there is nothing wrong with slaughtering it after the appointed time. This is by analogy with the one who sleeps and misses a prayer, or forgets it – he should pray it as soon as he wakes up or remembers it. 
It is permissible to slaughter the udhiyah at any time, night or day, but it is better to slaughter it during the day, and it is better to slaughter on the day of ‘Eid after the two khutbahs. Each day is better than the day that follows it, because that means that one is hastening to do good.

It is well known in sharee’ah that divorce takes place when the words are uttered, written or indicated by a gesture that takes the place of speaking. See question No.  20660. This is something that is between the husband and his Lord if no one hears him say that. With the regard to divorce via e-mail there is no problem regarding the fact that it is valid: if the husband writes that he is divorcing his wife then the divorce takes place by virtue of that writing. But the issue here is whether this divorce can be proven and authenticated (in court).  
It seems that the husband’s divorce of his wife via e-mail is effective if it is proven definitively that the one who sent the e-mail containing the words of divorce is the husband or someone whom the husband appointed to issue the divorce, and he acknowledges that and does not deny it. 
But if that cannot be proven and the husband does not acknowledge it, then this e-mail message is not valid and divorce does not take place in this case, because it is well known to those who work in this field that it is possible to hack into e-mail accounts and send messages. So we cannot be absolutely certain that the one who sent it is the husband. 
So proof and confirmation must be sought from the husband, and the the divorce should not be regarded as having taken place until after it has been confirmed by the husband. If he confirms it then the ‘iddah begins from the time when he uttered or wrote the words of divorce. 
Secondly: 
The two remaining divorces (talaaq) cannot take place immediately, for divorce takes place one at a time. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The divorce is twice” [al-Baqarah 2:229]
This refers to the revocable divorce (i.e., first or second talaaq). Allah did not say “two divorces” – which indicates that it can only happen one at a time, followed by the ‘iddah in each case. If the first divorce is valid as is counted as such, then we have to wait out the ‘iddah. If he takes you back during the ‘iddah, then this divorce counts as one of the three divorces, and he has to bring witnesses to attest to that. If he does not take you back during the ‘iddah, then you are divorced as soon as the ‘iddah is over, and it is not permissible for him to take you back without a new marriage contract and a new mahr, and he is regarded as a stranger to you like any other man who may propose marriage, and the marriage can only be done with your approval and the agreement of your guardian.
The applies in the case of a second divorce; if he takes you back during (the ‘iddah) then you are his wife. In the event of a third divorce, you become haraam for him until you have married another husband in a legitimate shar’i marriage which is not done solely with the intention of enabling you to remarry your first husband, and which is consummated in the proper manner. If it so happens that you get divorced from your second husband then it becomes permissible for you to remarry your first husband after the ‘iddah ends.

Please note that this is obvious to the purchaser and he knows about this. What is the ruling on this sale?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Selling gold that contains zircon stones for the price of 
    gold is something that is subject to further discussion. 

    If it is being sold for silver or paper money, there is 
    nothing wrong with that, so long as it is visible to the eye and the 
    purchaser knows about that, as you have mentioned. If it is being sold for 
    gold, then the stones must be separated from the gold so that the amount of 
    gold may be known, and it may be ensured that equivalent amounts of gold are 
    exchanged. This is indicated by the hadeeth of Faddaalah ibn ‘Ubayd about 
    the sale of a necklace, which was narrated by Muslim (1591) who said: When 
    the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was 
    in Khaybar, a necklace containing pearls and gold, which was part of the 
    booty, was brought to him to be sold. The Messenger of Allaah  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) ordered that the gold in the necklace 
    be separated from it, then the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) said to them: “Gold for gold, weight for weight.” 
    According to another report: “It should not be sold until it has been 
    separated.” 

    Al-Nawawi said in Sharh Muslim: 
This hadeeth shows that 
    it is not permissible to sell gold with something else for gold until it has 
    been separated, and gold should be sold for gold by weight, but it may be 
    sold for anything else however one wishes. Similarly silver combined with 
    anything else cannot be sold for silver… whether the amount is a little or a 
    lot. This was narrated from ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased 
    with him) and his son, and a number of the salaf, and it is the view of 
    al-Shaafa’i and Ahmad. End quote. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was 
    asked about selling gold which is combined with zircon stones for gold of 
    the same weight. He replied: 

    This transaction is haraam, because it involves riba, as it 
    is adding something to the gold by giving gold in return for the gems etc. 
    This is like the necklace which was mentioned in the hadeeth of Faddaalah 
    ibn ‘Ubayd, who bought a necklace that contained gold and pearls for twelve 
    dinars, and he separated it and found that it contained more, and the

Is Singling out Rajab for ‘Umrah Permissible?","Praise be to Allah.Is There any hadith about offering ‘Umrah in Rajab? 
There is no report from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) – as far as we know – to suggest that there is any particular virtue in performing ‘Umrah in the month of Rajab , or that it is encouraged. Rather it is proven that there is a particular virtue in performing ‘Umrah in the month of Ramadan , and in the months of Hajj, which are Shawwal, Dhu’l-Qa’dah and Dhu’l-Hijjah. 
There is no report to prove that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) performed ‘Umrah in Rajab , rather that was denied by ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her), who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) never performed ‘Umrah in Rajab. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1776; Muslim, 1255)
Is Singling out Rajab for ‘Umrah Permissible?
Something that has been introduced into the religion is what some people do, namely singling out the month of Rajab for ‘Umrah, because no one should single out a specific time for doing an act of worship unless that has been prescribed in Shari’ah. 
Ibn al-‘Attar, the student of al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on them both) said: 
What I have heard about the people of Makkah, may Allah increase it in honour, is that they are accustomed to performing ‘Umrah a great deal in Rajab . This is something for which I know of no basis, rather it is proven in the hadith that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “ ‘Umrah in Ramadan is equivalent to Hajj.” End quote.
Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his Fatawa (6/131): 
“With regard to singling out some days of Rajab for any kinds of ziyarah etc, there is no basis for that. Imam Abu Shamah stated in his book al-Bida’ wa’l-Hawadith that performing acts of worship at specific times which were not prescribed by Islam is not right, because no time is better than any other, except times when it is prescribed to perform a certain kind of worship, or a time when all kinds of good deeds are better than at other times. Hence the scholars denounced the singling out of the month of Rajab for performing ‘Umrah a great deal.”
But if a person goes for ‘Umrah during Rajab without believing that there is any special virtue in that, but it just so happens that it is easy for him to travel at that time, there is nothing wrong with that.

Shaykh Ibn Baaz said: 
When (the pilgrim) has finished bidding 
    farewell to the House and wants to leave the mosque, he should walk normally, facing forwards, until he exits. He should not walk backwards, 
    because there is no report that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or his companions did this, rather it is an 
    innovation (bid’ah). The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Whoever does any action that is not part of this matter 
    of ours (i.e., Islam) will have it rejected.” Narrated by Muslim, 1718. And he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Beware of

    mistakes that some people make during the farewell tawaaf: 
Some of them exit the mosque, after the farewell tawaaf, walking backwards, claiming that they 
    are venerating the Ka’bah thereby. This goes against the Sunnah, rather it is the kind of innovation (bid’ah) against which the Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) warned us when he said: “Every innovation is a going astray.” Innovation (bid’ah) means 
    everything that has been invented in ‘aqeedah (belief) or ‘ibaadah (worship) that goes against the way of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his Rightly-Guided Caliphs. Does this person who walks backwards and claims to be venerating the Ka’bah think 
    that he is venerating it more than the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did? Or does he think that the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the Rightly-Guided Caliphs did not know that this was an act of veneration towards the 
    Ka’bah?!

    It seems that with regard to these meals, the company gives

    what is left of your own meal that the company bought for you, unless the 
    company has specifically stated that nothing should be taken away. In that 
    case it is not permissible for you to take it. 
There is nothing wrong 
    with taking the files that have been thrown out and making use of them,

“perform Tayammum with clean earth”
[al-Nisa’ 4:43]
Sa’eed (translated here as earth) means the face of the earth. Tayyib (translated here as clean) means pure. 
It is permissible to do tayammum with anything that is from the earth. This is the view of Abu Haneefah and Maalik. In their view, it is valid to do tayammum with dust, sand and pebbles. Abu Haneefah regarded it as permissible to do tayammum with smooth rocks surfaces, plastered walls and clay made from pure mud. The same applies if one strikes a cloth and dust rises. 
Badaa’i’ al-Sanaa’i’, 1/53; al-Taaj wa’l-Ilkeel, 1/511; al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fihqiyyah, 14/261 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) favoured the view that it is permissible to do tayammum with things other than dust from other parts of the earth, if one cannot find dust. Al-Ikhtiyaaraat al-Fiqhiyyah, p. 28. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about a sick person who cannot find dust – can he do tayammum by striking his hands on the wall or the bed, and so on? 
He replied: If the wall is built of something that comes from the earth, such as rocks or mud bricks, then it is permissible to use it for tayammum. But if the wall is covered with wood or paint, if there is any dust on it then it may be used for tayammum and there is nothing wrong with that. It is like doing tayammum on the ground, because dust particles come from the earth. But if there is no dust on it, then it is not from the earth and cannot be used for tayammum. 
With regard to the bed we say, if there is dust on it, it may be used for tayammum, otherwise it should not be used for tayammum because it does not come from the earth. 
End quote from Fataawa al-Tahaarah, p. 240. 
Conclusion: 
It is permissible to do tayammum on walls or vessels made of clay, so long as they are not painted. If they are painted, tayammum is not valid unless there is dust on them. The Muslim can put some dirt or sand in a vessel and use that for tayammum.

Are both of them to be found in the Quran and Sunnah?,Yawm al-Hajj al-Akbar (the greatest day of Hajj) is the Day of Sacrifice which is the tenth day of Dhul Hijjah.,"What is Yawm al-Hajj al-akbar? 


Why the Day of Sacrifice is called Yawm al-Hajj al-akbar","Praise be to Allah.What is Yawm al-Hajj al-akbar? 
The greatest day of Hajj (yawm al-Hajj al-akbar) is the Day of Sacrifice , which is the tenth day of Dhu’l-Hijjah. 
Abu Dawud narrated from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stood up on the day of Sacrifice during the Hajj that he performed and said: “What day is this?” They said, “the Day of Sacrifice.” He said, “This is the greatest day of Hajj.” (Sunan Abi Dawud, 1945; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud, 1700) 
Al-Bukhari (369) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Abu Bakr al-Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with him) sent me amongst the announcers to proclaim in Mina on the Day of Sacrifice, “After this year no mushrik is allowed to perform Hajj or to circumambulate the House naked.” 
Why the Day of Sacrifice is called Yawm al-Hajj al-akbar
The Day of Sacrifice is called the greatest day of Hajj because during that night there is the standing at ‘Arafah and staying overnight in al-Mash’ar al-Haram. And during that day there is the stoning of the Jamrah , offering the sacrifice, shaving the head , tawaf and sa’i, which are all actions of Hajj. 
The day of Hajj refers to the time, and the description of greatest refers to the actions done at that time. The greatest day of Hajj is mentioned in the Quran where Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And a declaration from Allah and His Messenger to mankind on the greatest day (the 10th of Dhul-Hijjah — the 12th month of Islamic calendar).” [al-Tawbah 9:3]

36778,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/36778,"I have date palms, and gather the dates and sell them in the market. What is the rate of zakaah on them?","I have date palms, and gather the dates and sell them in the market. What is the rate of zakaah on them?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 
The scholars are 
    unanimously agreed that zakaah must be paid on dates, but that no zakaah is 
    due unless they meet the nisaab (minimum threshold at which zakaah becomes 
    due), which is five wasqs. A wasq equals sixty saa’, and a saa’ is four 
    mudds, and a mudd is what an average man scoops up in two hands.  

    See al-Mughni, 4/154 

    The evidence for that in the Sunnah is the report narrated by 
    Muslim (979) from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri, that the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no zakaah due on grains or 
    dates unless they reach (the amount of) five wasqs.” 

    Secondly:  

    The rate of zakaah that is to be paid on crops and fruits 
    differs according to the way in which they are irrigated. 

    If they are irrigated without any expenditure, such as if 
    they are irrigated by rainfall or springs, or they are close to water and 
    their roots can drink from it, then the rate of zakaah is one-tenth. 

    If they are irrigated with expenditure, such as if a machine 
    is needed to irrigate them and bring water to them, then the rate of zakaah 
    is half of one-tenth. 

    This is the view of the four Imams, and Ibn Qudaamah said in
    al-Mughni (4/164-166): We do not know of any differing opinion. 

    What is meant by expenditure is if a machine is needed in 
    order to bring water to the land. This was stated in al-Mughni, 
    4/166. The evidence for that is the report narrated by al-Bukhaari (1438) 
    from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him), that the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “For that 
    which is watered by the sky or a spring, or by its roots, (the rate of 
    zakaah) is one-tenth, and for that which is watered by a camel, (the rate of 
    zakaah) is half of one-tenth.” 

    Al-Haafiz said: 

    Al-Khattaabi said: “by its roots” means that which finds 
    water through its roots without being irrigated. 

    “A camel” refers to a camel that is used to bring water. 
    Camels are mentioned by way of example here; oxen and other animals used for 
    the same purpose also come under this ruling. 

    Shaykh Ibn Baaz said (14/74): 
Grains and fruits that 
    are irrigated by rain, rivers and springs, such as dates, grapes, wheat and 
    barley, are subject to zakaah at a rate of one-tenth. For those that are 
    irrigated by means of machines etc, the rate is half of one-tenth. 

    It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (9/176): 

    One-tenth is due on that which is watered without any effort, 
    such as by rain, streams and that which drinks through its roots, and half 
    of one-tenth is due on that which is irrigated by artificial means such as 
    machines. If it is irrigated for half the year by one means and for half the 
    year by the other, then the rate is three-quarters of one-tenth. If it is 
    watered by one means more than by the other, then it should be worked out 
    according to the means which is used more. If the ratio is unknown, then 
    one-tenth must be paid.",Islam Q&A

He said, “O people, give in charity!” Then he went over to the women and said, “O women, give in charity for I have seen that you are the majority of the people of Hell.” When he went home, Zaynab the wife of Ibn Mas’ood came seeking permission to see him. It was said, “O Messenger of Allah, here is Zaynab.” He said, “Which Zaynab?” It was said, “The wife of Ibn Mas’ood.” He said, “Yes, let her in.” So they let her in and she said, “O Prophet of Allah, today you enjoined charity, and I have some jewellery which I wanted to give in charity, but Ibn Mas’ood claims that he and his child have more right to receive it in charity.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Give it in charity to Ibn Mas’ood, for your husband and your child have the most right that you should give it to them in charity.”

It is permissible for me to offer them at a time after work is over?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for a Muslim to delay his prayers beyond the time when they are due without a legitimate excuse. Legitimate excuses which allow a Muslim to delay his prayers until the time for them is over include sleeping and forgetting. Doing worldly work is not an excuse for not praying or for delaying a prayer until its time is over. Rather one of the characteristics of the sincere believers is that they do not let business or trade distract them from remembering Allah and establishing regular prayer. 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“In houses (mosques) which Allah has ordered to be raised (to be cleaned, and to be honoured), in them His Name is remembered [i.e. Adhan, Iqaamah, Salah (prayers), invocations, recitation of the Quran]. Therein glorify Him (Allah) in the mornings and in the afternoons or the evenings,
37. Men whom neither trade nor sale (business) diverts from the remembrance of Allah (with heart and tongue) nor from performing As-Salah (Iqaamat-as-Salah) nor from giving the Zakaah. They fear a Day when hearts and eyes will be overturned (out of the horror of the torment of the Day of Resurrection).
38. That Allah may reward them according to the best of their deeds, and add even more for them out of His Grace. And Allah provides without measure to whom He wills”
[al-Noor 24:36-38]
Even though these men engaged in trade, buying and selling, that was no excuse and it did not distract them from giving precedence to “the remembrance of Allah (with heart and tongue) nor from performing As-Salah (Iqaamat-as-Salah) nor from giving the Zakaah.”  Rather they made obedience to Allah and worship of Him their ultimate goal and purpose, and whatever came between them and that goal, they rejected it. 
Because giving up worldly interests is hard for most people, and earning and various kinds of trade are dear to them, and it is hard for them to give that up in most cases, and to give precedence to the rights of Allah, Allah mentions that which will motivate and encourage them, as He says: “They fear a Day when hearts and eyes will be overturned (out of the horror of the torment of the Day of Resurrection)” – because of the intensity of its horrors and suffering. Hence they will fear that Day, so it become easier for them to strive for the Hereafter and give up that which distracts them from it. 
Tafseer al-Sa’di. 
Concerning the obligation of offering prayers and the ruling on its timing, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, As-Salah (the prayer) is enjoined on the believers at fixed hours”
[al-Nisa’ 4:103].
Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Sa’di said: 
This means it is enjoined at its time, which indicates that it is obligatory and that it has a time (to be offered) and is not valid at any other time. These are the times that are well known among the Muslims, young and old, scholars and ignorant. They learned that from their Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who said: “Pray as you have seen me praying.” The phrase “on the believers” indicates that prayer is the measure of faith, and a the quality of person’s prayers corresponds with his level of faith. 
Tafseer al-Sa’di. 
And Allah says, warning those who delay their prayers until the time for them is over with no legitimate excuse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Then, there has succeeded them a posterity who have given up As-Salaat (the prayers) [i.e. made their Salaat (prayers) to be lost, either by not offering them or by not offering them perfectly or by not offering them in their proper fixed times] and have followed lusts. So they will be thrown in Hell.
60. Except those who repent and believe (in the Oneness of Allah and His Messenger Muhammad), and work righteousness. Such will enter Paradise and they will not be wronged in aught”
[Maryam 19:59-60]
And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So woe unto those performers of Salah (prayers) (hypocrites),
5. Those who delay their Salah (prayer from their stated fixed times)”
[Al-Maa’oon 107:4-5] 
Ibn Katheer said: 
It was narrated from Ibn Mas’ood that it was said to him that Allah mentions prayer a great deal in the Quran: “Those who delay their Salah (prayer from their stated fixed times)” [Al-Maa’oon 107:5] and “Those who remain constant in their Salah (prayers)” [al-Ma’aarij 70:23] and “and they are constant in guarding their Salah (prayers)” [al-An’aam 6:92]. Ibn Mas’ood said: (This means) offering prayers at the stated times. They said: We thought that these verses referred to not praying at all. He said: That is kufr. 
Al-Awzaa’i said, quoting from Ibraaheem ibn Yazeed, that ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez recited: “Then, there has succeeded them a posterity who have given up As-Salaat (the prayers) [i.e. made their Salaat (prayers) to be lost, either by not offering them or by not offering them perfectly or by not offering them in their proper fixed times] and have followed lusts. So they will be thrown in Hell” [Maryam 19:59]. Then he said: “Their giving up their prayers does not mean that they do not pray at all, rather it means that they have given up praying at the proper times.” 
Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 3/128, 129. 
So it is not permissible for you to delay your prayers from the proper time based on the excuse of work. If you cannot pray on time at work, then you should leave this job and look for another job which will not cause you to miss your prayers. The wise Muslim should not expose himself to the threat of his Lord and he should not sell his religious commitment for the sake of passing worldly interests.

Witr prayer is Sunnah muakkadah (a confirmed sunnah) according to the majority of scholars, and some of the fuqaha regarded it as obligatory. 
Why witr is not obligatory
The fact that witr prayer is not obligatory is indicated by the hadith narrated by al-Bukhari (1891) and Muslim (11) from Talhah ibn ‘Ubayd-Allah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: A man came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: “O Messenger of Allah, what prayers has Allah enjoined on me?” He said: “The five prayers, unless you do anything voluntarily.” The version narrated by Muslim says: “Five prayers every day and night.” He said: “Do I have to do anything else?’ He said, “No, unless you do it voluntarily.” 
Al-Nawawi said: 
“This indicates that Witr prayer is not obligatory.” 
Al-Hafiz said in al-Fath: 
“This indicates that no prayers during the day and night are obligatory apart from the five prayers; this is contrary to the view of those who say that Witr or the two Sunnah rak’ahs of Fajr are obligatory.”
Hadiths about witr prayer
However, it is the most confirmed Sunnah and was enjoined by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in more than one hadith. 
Muslim (754) narrated from Abu Sa’id (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Perform Witr before morning comes.”

Hence, we should continue to offer Witr prayer regularly, whether travelling or not , as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to do. Al-Bukhari (1000) and Muslim (700) narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was on a journey, atop his mount, whichever direction it was facing, gesturing the motions of the night prayer , except the obligatory prayer, and he prayed Witr atop his mount.” 
Ruling on neglecting witr prayer
Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Witr is not obligatory. This is the view of Malik and al-Shafi'i. Abu Hanifah said: it is obligatory. Then he said: Ahmad said: Whoever omits to pray Witr deliberately is a bad man, whose testimony should not be accepted. He wanted to emphasize that it is confirmed because of the ahadith which say that it is enjoined and encouraged.” (Al-Mughni, 1/827) 
The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked: Is Witr prayer obligatory, and will the one who prays it on some days and not on others be punished for that? 
They replied: 
“Witr prayer is Sunnah muakkadah (a confirmed Sunnah) which the believer should adhere to. Whoever prays it on some days and not on others will not be blamed for that, but he should be advised to pray Witr regularly. 
It is prescribed to pray two rak’ahs during the day instead if a person misses it , because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to do that, as it was narrated that ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: If sleep or sickness kept him from praying at night, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would pray twelve rak'ahs during the day. (Narrated by Muslim in his Sahih)
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) usually prayed eleven rak’ahs at night, saying the salam after each two rak'ahs then praying one rak'ah on its own. But if sleep or sickness kept him from doing that, he would pray twelve rak’ahs during the day, as ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) stated. 
Based on this, if a person usually prays five rak’ahs at night but he sleeps or misses them for any other reason, it is prescribed for him to pray six rak’ahs during the day, saying salam after each two rak’ahs. If his habit is to pray three rak’ahs, then he should pray four rak'ahs with two salams, and if his habit is to pray seven rak’ahs, he should pray eight with the salam after each two rak’ahs.” (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 7/172)
