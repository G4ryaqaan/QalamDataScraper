How the deceased is questioned in the grave


3 questions in the grave: What are they?","Praise be to Allah.The Grave is the first of the stages of the Hereafter 
When the son of Adam dies and his soul departs and he is placed in his grave , then he is in the first stage of the Hereafter, because the grave is the first of the stages of the Hereafter . 
Haani, the freed slave of ‘Uthman ibn ‘Affan, said: when ‘Uthman ibn ‘Affan stood by a grave he would weep until his beard became wet. It was said to him, “You remember Paradise and Hell and you do not weep, but you weep because of this?” He said, “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘The grave is the first of the stages of the Hereafter; whoever is saved from it, whatever comes afterwards will be easier  for him, but if he is not saved from it, what comes afterwards will be worse for him.’” And the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I have never seen any scene but the grave is more frightening than it.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2308; Ibn Majah, 4567; classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami’, 1684). 
How the deceased is questioned in the grave
The two angels who are charged with questioning come to him and ask him what he used to believe in in this world, who was his Lord, what was his religion and who was his Prophet. If he gives a good answer, that is good, but if he does not answer them they inflict a severe and painful beating on him. 
If he was one of the righteous, angels with white faces come to him, but if he was one of the evildoers, angels with dark faces come to him. This is the fitnah or tribulation that he suffers. 
‘Aishah narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say, ‘Allahumma inni a’udhu bika min al-kasali wa’l-haram wa’l-maghram wa’l-matham. Allahumma inni a’udhu bika min ‘adhab al-nar wa fitnat il-nar, wa fitnat il-qabri, wa ‘adhab il-qabri, wa sharri fitnat il-ghina wa sharri fitnat il-faqr wa min sharri fitnat il-masih il-Dajjal. Allahumma ighsil khatayaya bi ma al-thalji wa’l-baradi wa naqqi qalbi min al-khataya kama yunaqqa al-thawb al-abyad min al-danas, wa ba’id bayni wa bayna khatayaya kama ba’adta bayna al-mashriqi wa’l-maghrib (O Allah! I seek refuge with You from laziness and old age, and from debts and sins; from the torment of the Fire and from the tribulation of the Fire, and from the tribulation of the grave and the torment of the grave , and from the evil of the tribulation of wealth, and from the evil of the tribulation of poverty, and from the evil of the tribulation of the Dajjal (Antichrist). O Allah! Wash away my sins with the water of snow and hail, and cleanse my heart from sin as a white garment is cleansed from filth, and put a great distance between me and my sins, as great as the distance You have made between the East and the West).” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 6014). 
Ibn Hajar said: 
“The phrase “from the tribulation of the grave” means the questioning of the two angels.” (Fath al-Bari, 11/177) 
And al-Mubarakfuri said: 
“The tribulation of the grave” means confusion when answering the two angels. (Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi, 9/328)
3 questions in the grave: What are they?
With regard to the questions that the angels will ask in the grave, this is explained clearly in the following hadith: 
Al-Bara (may Allah be pleased with him) said: We went out with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) for the funeral of a man from among the Ansar. We came to the grave and when (the deceased) was placed in the lahd , the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sat down and we sat around him, as if there were birds on our heads (i.e., quiet and still). In his hand he had a stick with which he was scratching the ground. Then he raised his head and said, “Seek refuge with Allah from the torment of the grave ”, two or three times. Then he said, “When the believing slave is about to depart this world and enter the Hereafter, there come down to him from heaven angels with white faces like the sun, and they sit around him as far as the eye can see. They bring with them shrouds from Paradise and perfumes from Paradise. Then the Angel of Death comes and sits by his head, and he says, ‘O good soul, come forth to forgiveness from Allah and His pleasure.’ Then it comes out easily like a drop of water from the mouth of a waterskin. When he seizes it, they do not leave it in his hand for an instant before they take it and put it in that shroud with that perfume, and there comes from it a fragrance like the finest musk on the face of the earth. Then they ascend and they do not pass by any group of angels but they say, ‘Who is this good soul?’ and they say, ‘It is So and So the son of So and So, calling him by the best names by which he was known in this world, until they reach the lowest heaven. They ask for it to be opened to them and it is opened, and (the soul) is welcomed and accompanied to the next heaven by those who are closest to Allah, until they reach the seventh heaven. Then Allah says: ‘Record the book of My slave in ‘Illiyyun in the seventh heaven, and return him to the earth, for from it I created them, to it I will return them and from it I will bring them forth once again.’ So his soul is returned to his body and there come to him two angels who make him sit up and they say to him, ‘Who is your Lord?’ He says, ‘Allah.’ They say, ‘What is your religion?’ He says, ‘My religion is Islam.’ They say, ‘Who is this man who was sent among you?’ He says, ‘He is the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).’ They say, ‘What did you do?’ He says, ‘I read the Book of Allah and I believed in it.’ Then a voice calls out from heaven, ‘My slave has spoken the truth, so prepare for him a bed from Paradise and clothe him from Paradise, and open for him a gate to Paradise.’ Then there comes to him some of its fragrance, and his grave is made wide, as far as he can see. Then there comes to him a man with a handsome face and handsome clothes, and a good fragrance, who says, ‘Receive the glad tidings that will bring you joy this day.’ He says, ‘Who are you? Your face is a face which brings glad tidings.’ He says, ‘I am your righteous deeds.’ He says, ‘O Lord, hasten the Hour so that I may return to my family and my wealth.’ But when the disbelieving slave is about to depart this world and enter the Hereafter, there come down to him from heaven angels with black faces, bringing sackcloth, and they sit around him as far as the eye can see. Then the Angel of Death comes and sits by his head, and he says, ‘O evil soul, come forth to the wrath of Allah and His anger.’ Then his soul disperses inside his body, then comes out cutting the veins and nerves, like a skewer passing through wet wool. When he seizes it, they do not leave it in his hand for an instant before they take it and put it in that sackcloth, and there comes from it a stench like the foulest stench of a dead body on the face of the earth. Then they ascend and they do not pass by any group of angels but they say, ‘Who is this evil soul?’ and they say, ‘It is So and So the son of So and So, calling him by the worst names by which he was known in this world, until they reach the lowest heaven. They ask for it to be opened to them and it is not opened.” Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) recited (interpretation of the meaning): 
“for them the gates of heaven will not be opened, and they will not enter Paradise until the camel goes through the eye of the needle” [al-A’raf 7:40]
He said: “Then Allah says, ‘Record the book of My slave in Sijjin in the lowest earth, and return him to the earth, for from it I created them, to it I will return them and from it I will bring them forth once again.’ So his soul is cast down.”  Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) recited the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and whoever assigns partners to Allah, it is as if he had fallen from the sky, and the birds had snatched him, or the wind had thrown him to a far off place” [al-Hajj 22:31]
He said: “Then his soul is returned to his body, and there come to him two angels who make him sit up and they say to him, ‘Who is your Lord?’ He says, ‘Oh, oh, I don’t know.’ They say, ‘What is your religion?’ He says, ‘Oh, oh, I don’t know.’ Then a voice calls out from heaven, ‘Prepare for him a bed from Hell and clothe him from Hell, and open for him a gate to Hell.’ Then there comes to him some of its heat and hot winds, and his grave is constricted and compresses him until his ribs interlock. Then there comes to him a man with an ugly face and ugly clothes, and a foul stench, who says, ‘Receive the bad news, this is the day that you were promised.’ He says, ‘Who are you? Your face is a face which forebodes evil.’ He says, ‘I am your evil deeds.’ He says, ‘O Lord, do not let the Hour come, do not let the Hour come.’” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 4753; Ahmad, 18063 – this version was narrated by him. Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami’, 1676) 
The correct view is that the two angels will only question the deceased in his grave about matters of Tawid (monotheism) and ‘aqidah (belief). This is quite clear.

10419,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10419,Ruling on smiling during prayer,if we smile during prayer do we have to cotinue or start the prayer again,,,"Praise be to Allah.The Muslim should be solemn and submissive during his prayer and he should keep away from everything that may prevent him from being solemn and submissive, because focus is the heart of prayer. Allah praised the believers when He said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Successful indeed are the believers.
Those who offer their Salah (prayers) with all solemnity and full submissiveness” [al-Mu’minoon 23:1-2]
Undoubtedly one of the things that keep a person from being solemn and submissive is smiling during prayer. 
With regard to the ruling on smiling during prayer, it does not invalidate the prayer. See al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, part 27, p. 124. 
Ibn Qudaamah said: Ibn al-Mundhir said: They were unanimously agreed that laughing invalidates prayer, and most of the scholars said that smiling does not invalidate prayer. Al-Mughni, part 1, p. 394 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: as for smiling, it does not invalidate prayer, but if one giggles in prayer then that invalidates it.  Al-Fataawa al-Kubra, part 2, p. 227 
Al-Nawawi said: our view is that smiling in prayer does not affect it. Al-Majmoo’, part 4, p. 22 
Al-Bahooti said: It does not invalidate the prayer if one smiles whilst praying. This is the view of the majority narrated by Ibn al-Mundhir. Kashshaaf al-Qinaa’, part 1, p. 402 
Since it does not invalidate the prayer, then you should complete the prayer and not stop praying. But you should avoid things that may make you do that. See the book 33 Means of Developing Khushoo’ in prayer, on this web site.

10427,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10427,Ruling on Boxing,"My local mosque is thinking about setting up boxing classes. I wanted to know whether this is permissibile. The reason being that is there not a hadith of the Prophet (SAW) where he sees two men wrestling/ sparring and he tells them to avoid the face for we have been created in the likeness of Adam (AS)? 
According to this, is it mub'ah to practice boxing with another brother and hit one another in the face?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The Islamic sharee’ah permits all things that are beneficial 
          to the body and do not harm it, and it forbids all things that may cause 
          damage or harm to the body. The Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Your body has rights 
          over you.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, Kitaab 
          al-Sawm, 1839)  
If sports are free from things which are forbidden 
          in sharee’ah, then practising those sports is beneficial. Boxing is 
          an ancient sport that was practised by the Greeks.  
Boxing is the worst 
          kind of sport, and probably it does not even deserve to be called a 
          sport, despite the fact that western nations, in particular – where 
          boxing is widespread at a professional level – call it “the noble sport” 
          and a form of self-defence. They forget, or overlook, the fact that 
          the main aim of boxing is to harm one's opponent and throw him to the 
          ground, preferably with the “decisive blow” (or “knock-out”), as they 
          call it, which is the highest level of victory in boxing.  
“Many voices have been 
          raised in the parliaments of many countries demanding a ban on professional 
          boxing, in view of the harm that has been caused to many boxers. Sweden 
          has succeeded in imposing such a ban, whilst many other nations have 
          failed to do so, despite the many injuries, and even deaths, caused 
          to many professional boxers as a direct result of this violent sport. 
          
 The fact of the 
          matter is that the deaths of so many boxers is the reason for many voices 
          calling for an end to this sport, or at least the imposition of strict 
          rules to limit its violence.”  (From Huna 
          London magazine, issue # 413, March 1983).  
Dr. Roger Whirty, the spokesman of the British Medical 
          Council in Wales, spoke of the aims of the Council’s campaign against 
          boxing: “We want to show everyone that boxing is an extremely dangerous 
          sport, not only because of the increasing number of fatalities, but 
          also because of the disabilities which affect many more times that number. 
          In order  to achieve that, we are trying to put pressure on various 
          official bodies to condemn this sport, and not to consider it to be 
          a sport at all. I reiterate once again that the danger of this sport 
          lies in the harm caused to hundreds of boxers as a result of the disabilities 
          that they suffer.  
The number of boxers who have died as a result of injuries 
          sustained in boxing between 1945 and 1983 is three hundred and fifty.” 
          (From Huna London 
          magazine, issue # 413, March 1983).  
The Islamic attitude towards this sport:  
The principles of Islam 
          are completely opposed to the idea of the ummah accepting this dangerous 
          deviation as a moral or intellectual trend which would permit such violent 
          fights between members of the ummah or of the human race as a whole. 
          
 Among these principles 
          we may list the following:   
1.Harm. We have already mentioned the harm and danger to human 
          life involved in this sport, and the testimony of western specialists 
          who are motivated by their humanitarian feelings to fight and strive 
          to eliminate boxing from the international sporting lexicon. 
2.Violating the sanctity of the face. Boxing is based on allowing 
          punches to the face of one's opponent using the maximum force that one 
          possesses. Blows to the face earn more points than blows to any other 
          part of the body. This clearly goes against the teaching of the Prophet 
           (peace and blessings of Allaah 
          be upon him), as narrated by Abu Hurayrah: “When any one of you fights, 
          let him avoid (striking) the face.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, 
          5/215). 
Al-Haafiz said: “This prohibition also 
          includes all those who are struck for the purpose of hadd 
          or ta’zeer punishments 
          or discipline. According to the hadeeth narrated by Abu Bakrah and others, 
          which was recorded by Abu Dawood and others, about the woman who had 
          committed adultery, the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded that she should 
          be stoned to death, and said, ‘Stone her, but avoid the face.’ (Narrated 
          by Abu Dawood, 4/152). If that is the command in the case of one who 
          is being punished and is going to die anyway, then the rule is even 
          more applicable in cases of lesser severity.” See al-Fath, 
          5/216 
Al-Nawawi said: “The scholars said: 
          it is forbidden to strike the face because it is soft and all of a person's 
          beauty and most of his senses are located there. If the face is hit, 
          there is the fear that all or some of them may be destroyed or disfigured. 
          Any defect in the face is a terrible thing because it is so prominent 
          and obvious, and usually the person who is hit in the face will not 
          be spared some disfigurement.” (al-Fath, 
          5/216).
 In 
          al-Fath, he says concerning 
          the specific prohibition narrated in the hadeeth: 
“Al-Nawawi did not discuss the details of this prohibition. 
          It is clear that it is haraam, and this is supported by the hadeeth 
          of Suwayd ibn Maqran al-Sahaabi, that the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saw a man slap a slave (or 
          a boy) in the face, and he said, “Do you not know that the face is inviolate?” 
          (Muslim, 3/1280.","Qadaaya al-Lahw wa’l-Tarfeeh, p. 373"
10428,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10428,Bowing to anyone other than Allaah is haraam,"Is it permisible to bow while greeting a respectable/elder person/parent Other than saying ""As-salam Alaykum Wa-rahmatullahi Wa-barakatuh"".",,,"Praise be to Allah.The usual greeting is “Assalaamu 
          ‘alaykum wa rahmat-Allaahi wa barakaatuhu (Peace be upon 
          you, and the Mercy of Allaah and His Blessings), because Allaah says 
          (interpretation of the meaning): 
“greet 
          one another with a greeting from Allaah (i.e. say: As-Salaamu 
          ‘Alaykum — peace be on you), blessed and good”

The ahaadeeth explain this greeting 
          clearly. 
 But bowing is not permitted, unless 
          the person being greeted is old and is unable to stand up, or is one 
          of your parents and you do not want to make him or her stand up to shake 
          your hand or embrace you. So if you bow and kiss his head or forehead 
          out of respect for the rights that he has over you, then this is not 
          the kind of bowing that constitutes an act of worship. Undoubtedly bowing 
          is an act of worship towards Allaah, as in rukoo’ (the bowing in prayer), 
          so if that is done without shaking hands or kissing, it is an act of 
          veneration towards that person and is therefore shirk.",Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Jibreen

          If a man divorces his wife with the first or second talaaq, 
          once her ‘iddah is over she is divorced and becomes a “stranger” (non-mahram) 
          to him; she cannot go back to him except with a new marriage contract 
          which fulfils all the conditions set out in sharee’ah (see Question 
          no. 2127). 
 
          But if he divorces his wife with the third talaaq, then 
          she becomes haraam to her first husband until she has married a second 
          husband in a genuine marriage which is consummated. The Qur’aanic evidence 
          for that is the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): 
 
          “The divorce is twice, after that, either you retain 
          her on reasonable terms or release her with kindness…
 
          And if he has divorced her (the third time), then 
          she is not lawful unto him thereafter until she has married another 
          husband”
 
          [al-Baqarah 2:229-230]
 
           The last divorce refers to the third divorce, according 
          to all the scholars. 
 
          The evidence from the Sunnah is the hadeeth narrated 
          by ‘Urwah ibn al-Zubayr, according to which ‘Aa’ishah told him that 
          the wife of Rifaa’ah al-Qurazi came to the Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said, “O Messenger of 
          Allaah, Rifaa’ah divorced me thrice, then I was married to ‘Abd al-Rahmaan 
          ibn al-Zubayr al-Qurazi, but he has nothing with him except something 
          like this fringe. The Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Perhaps you want 
          to go back to Rifaa’ah? No, (it is not possible), unless and until you 
          enjoy the sexual relation with him (‘Abd al-Rahmaan), and he enjoys 
          the sexual relation with you.” 
 
          (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4856; Muslim, 2587) 
 
          The phrase “divorced me three times” means that this 
          was the divorce which meant that she was no longer married to him, which 
          is the third talaaq. The Prophet’s words “until you enjoy the sexual 
          relation with him (‘Abd al-Rahmaan), and he enjoys the sexual relation 
          with you” refer to intercourse. 
 
          Al-Nawawi said: “This hadeeth indicates that the woman who has been 
          divorced by a third talaaq is not permissible to the man who has divorced 
          her until she has been married by another husband, who has intercourse 
          with her then separates from her, and she completes her ‘iddah. Merely 
          drawing up the marriage contract with her does not make her permissible 
          to the first husband. This is the view of all the scholars among the 
          Sahaabah, Taabi’een and those who came after them.

Why this religion is called Islam","Praise be to Allah.Lexical meaning of Islam
If you refer to Arabic language dictionaries, you will find that the meaning of the word Islam is: submission , humbling oneself, and obeying commands and heeding prohibitions without objection, sincerely worshipping Allah alone, believing what He tells us and having faith in Him. 
The word Islam has become the name of the religion which was brought by Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
Why this religion is called Islam 
All the religions on earth are called by various names, either the name of a specific man or a specific nation. So Christianity takes its name from Christ; Buddhism takes its name from its founder, the Buddha; the Zoroastrians became well known by this name because their founder and standard-bearer was Zoroaster. 
Similarly, Judaism took its name from a tribe known as Yehudah (Judah), so it became known as Judaism. And so on. 
Except for Islam ; for it is not attributed to any specific man or to any specific nation, rather its name refers to the meaning of the word Islam . What this name indicates is that the establishment and founding of this religion was not the work of one particular man and that it is not only for one particular nation to the exclusion of all others. Rather its aim is to give the attribute implied by the word Islam to all the peoples of the earth. So everyone who acquires this attribute, whether he is from the past or the present, is a Muslim, and everyone who acquires this attribute in the future will also be a Muslim.

What is a will in Islam?


How to write a will in Islam","Praise be to Allah.What is a gift in Islam?
There is a difference between a will and a gift. Property that is willingly given away while one is alive is considered to be a gift, which does not come under the same rulings as a will. However, it should be noted that it is not permissible for a person to give a gift to some of his children and not others, or to favour some of them over others in gift-giving . Rather they must be treated fairly, because of the hadith of An-Nu`man ibn Bashir, who said that his father brought him to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), when he gave him a gift, to ask the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to bear witness to it. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked, “Have you given something similar to all your children?” He said, “No.” He said, “Then take it back.” Then he said: “Fear Allah and treat your children fairly.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, Al-Hibah, 2398) 
What is a will in Islam?
With regard to the will , it is a set of instructions on how (one’s property) is to be disposed of after one’s death, or how it is to be given away after one’s death. 
The evidence that this (writing a will) is prescribed in Islam is found in the Quran and Sunnah, and the consensus of the scholars. Allah says (interpretation of the meanings): 
“It is prescribed for you, when death approaches any of you, if he leaves wealth, that he makes a bequest to parents and next of kin, according to reasonable manners. (This is) a duty upon the pious.” [Al-Baqarah 2:180] 
“(The distribution in all cases is) after the payment of legacies he may have bequeathed or debts.” [An-Nisa’ 4:11] 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah was being generous to you when He allowed you to give one-third of your wealth (in charity) when you die, to increase your good deeds.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah, Al-Wasaya, 2700; classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih Sunan Ibn Majah, no. 2190) 
The scholars unanimously agreed that writing a will is permissible. 
How to write a will in Islam
Writing a will may be obligatory with regard to the dues  one owes to others where there is no proof, lest they be lost or neglected. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible for any Muslim who has something concerning which a will should be made to stay for two nights without having his last will written and kept ready with him.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, Al-Wasaya 2533)
It is recommended for a man to write a will that some of his wealth be used for charitable purposes , so that the reward for that may reach him after his death. So Allah granted permission for a person to dispose of one third of his wealth for that purpose when death approaches. 
It is permitted to write a will concerning one third or less. Some of the scholars said it is preferable for it to be less than one-third, and the will does not apply to any of the heirs . The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No bequest is to be made to an heir.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, Al-Wasaya, 2047; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Sunan At-Tirmidhi, 1722). If the will is intended to harm the heirs or make things difficult for them, then that is prohibited, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“…so that no loss is caused (to anyone).” [An-Nisa’ 4:12] 
The will comes into effect when the person dies. It is permissible for the person who writes the will to revoke it or cancel it or revoke part of it. Carrying out the will is an important matter which was confirmed by Allah and mentioned before other things, and there is a stern warning issued to those who change it. 
With regard to the distribution of personal belongings, he does not have the right to state how they should be distributed after he dies , because the share of each heir has been defined by Allah, and He has explained who inherits and who does not inherit. So it is not permitted for any person to transgress the limits set by Allah, because Allah has warned against doing that. Allah says in Surat An-Nisa’ (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allah commands you as regards your children’s (inheritance): to the male, a portion equal to that of two females; if (there are) only daughters, two or more, their share is two-thirds of the inheritance; if only one, her share is a half. For parents, a sixth share of inheritance to each if the deceased left children; if no children, and the parents are the (only) heirs, the mother has a third; if the deceased left brothers or (sisters), the mother has a sixth. (The distribution in all cases is) after the payment of legacies he may have bequeathed or debts. You know not which of them, whether your parents or your children, are nearest to you in benefit; (these fixed shares) are ordained by Allah. And Allah is Ever All-Knower, All-Wise.
In that which your wives leave, your share is a half if they have no child; but if they leave a child, you get a fourth of that which they leave after payment of legacies that they may have bequeathed or debts. In that which you leave, their (your wives) share is a fourth if you leave no child; but if you leave a child, they get an eighth of that which you leave after payment of legacies that you may have bequeathed or debts. If the man or woman whose inheritance is in question has left neither ascendants nor descendants, but has left a brother or a sister, each one of the two gets a sixth; but if more than two, they share in a third, after payment of legacies he (or she) may have bequeathed or debts, so that no loss is caused (to anyone). This is a Commandment from Allah; and Allah is Ever All-Knowing, Most-Forbearing.
These are the limits (set by) Allah (or ordainments as regards laws of inheritance), and whosoever obeys Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad) will be admitted to Gardens under which rivers flow (in Paradise), to abide therein, and that will be the great success.
And whosoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad), and transgresses His limits, He will cast him into the Fire, to abide therein; and he shall have a disgraceful torment.” [An-Nisa’ 4:11-14]

There is no reason why you should not give your nephews and nieces whatever you want of your wealth while you are alive. As they are not your own children, you are not obliged to give to them all equally. You can give gifts to those whom you love and to whomever you wish, or to whoever among them is according to his or her need. Try to give to those who are religiously committed in ways that will help them to obey Allah. It is also permitted to bequeath to them one-third or less of your wealth so long as they are not your heirs.

10452,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10452,The reason why there is no picture of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him),why is it that there isn't a picture available of the prophet Muhammed[pbuh] anywhere in the world?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Islam came to prevent all means that may lead to shirk or the association of others in worship with Allaah. Among these means is the making of images, so sharee’ah forbids making images, and curses the one who does that, and a strong warning is issued to the one who does that. It was narrated from ‘Aa’ishah the Mother of the Believers that Umm Habeebah and Umm Salamah mentioned a church that they had seen in Abyssinia, in which there were images. They mentioned it to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and he said: “Those people, if there was a righteous man among them and he died, they would build a place of worship over his grave and put those images in it. They will be among the most evil of creation before Allaah on the Day of Resurrection.” (narrated by al-Bukhaari, al-Salaah, 409). 
It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came back from a journey and I had placed a curtain of mine that had pictures on it over (the door of) a room of mine. When the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saw it, he tore it and said, ‘The people who will receive the severest punishment on the Day of Resurrection will be those who try to make the like of Allaah’s creation.’ So we turned it (the curtain) into one or two cushions.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, al-Libaas, 5498). 
It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood said: “I heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: ‘The people who will be most severely punished on the Day of Resurrection will be the image-makers.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, al-Libaas, 5494).  
So how could he grant permission to make a picture of him? Hence none of the Sahaabah dared to make a picture or image of him, because they knew the ruling that doing so was haraam.
Allaah warns against exaggeration, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O people of the Scripture (Christians)! Do not exceed the limits in your religion”
[al-Nisaa’ 4:171] 
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) warned against doing anything that may involve exceeding the limits concerning him (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). He said: “Do not exaggerate about me as the Christians exaggerated about the son of Maryam, for I am just a slave, so say ‘The slave of Allaah and His Messenger.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, Ahaadeeth al-Anbiya’, 3189). 
Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab wrote a chapter entitled “Maa jaa’a ‘an sabab kufr Bani Adam huwa al-ghulw fi’l-saaliheen (What was narrated stating that the reason for the kufr of the sons of Adam was their exaggeration concerning the righteous).”, in which he said: “In al-Saheeh it is narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said, concerning the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): 
‘“And they have said: ‘You shall not leave your gods, nor shall you leave Wadd, nor Suwaa‘, nor Yaghooth, nor Ya‘ooq nor Nasr’ (these are the names of their idols).’
[Nooh 71:23] 
– “These were the names of righteous men among the people of Nooh. When they died, the Shaytaan inspired their people to set up stone altars in the places where they used to sit, and call them by their names. They did that but they did not worship them, until those people died, then the knowledge was forgotten and they were worshipped.” 
Ibn al-Qayyim said: “More than one of the salaf said: ‘when they died, the people started to frequent their graves, then they made statues of them, then as time passed they started to worship them.” (Fath al-Majeed Sharh Kitaab al-Tawheed by ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Hasan, p. 219) 
For this reason there are no pictures of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), because he forbade doing that, lest it lead to shirk. 
The implication of the testimony that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is that we believe in him and in the message that he brought, even though there are no pictures of him. The believers do not need a picture of him in order to follow him. The description of him that is given in the saheeh reports means that we have no need of his picture. Among the descriptions of him (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that have been narrated are the following: 
1-He (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was the most handsome of face of all people.
2-He had wide shoulders.
3-He was neither tall nor short (of average height).
4-He had a round face with a ruddy complexion.
5-His eyes were intensely black.
6-He had long eyelashes.
7- He was the Seal of the Prophets, the most generous of people in giving, he was the most forbearing and content of all people, he was the most sincere in speech of all people, he had the gentlest nature of all people and was the most easy-going with others. Those who saw him suddenly stood in awe of him and those who mized with him came to love him. Those who described him said they had never seen anyone like him before or since.”
See Sunan al-Tirmidhi, al-Manaaqib, 3571 and other books of Sunnah which give descriptions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
Undoubtedly the believers wish that they could have met the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Hence it says in the hadeeth narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “From those among my ummah who will love me the most will be those who would come after me, but every one amongst them would have the keenest desire to catch a glimpse of me even at the expense of his family and his wealth.” (Narrated by Muslim, al-Jannah wa Sifat Na’eemihaa, 5060). Undoubtedly love of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and following him are the means of being brought together with him in Paradise. Part of loving him (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is seeing him in a dream, which means seeing him in his real form. It was reported that Abu Hurayrah said: “I heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: ‘Whoever sees me in a dream will see me when he is awake, for the Shaytaan cannot take my form.’” Abu ‘Abd-Allaah said, Ibn Seereen said: this applies if one sees him in his true form.

Inshallah, you can answer soon, as I work in an office and there is no private place to pray, I have not asked for permission, and they said I could not pray at my desk.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    We praise Allaah Who has guided you to Islam, and we ask Him 
    to make you steadfast in following guidance and in faith, for He is 
    All-Hearing, Ever Responsive. 

    With regard to prayer, it is not necessary to have the 
    agreement of the owner of the organization or business, and you do not have 
    to ask him for permission. Rather you have to perform the prayers even if he 
    does not approve of that, because there should be no obedience to any 
    created being if it involves disobedience towards the Creator, and the 
    command of Allaah takes precedence over the command of anyone else. So you 
    must perform the prayers at the appointed time, because Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Verily, As‑Salaah (the prayer) is enjoined on the 
    believers at fixed hours”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:103]
If you pray without his 
    permission, your prayer is still valid and there is no sin on you. 

    With regard to some people who are not your mahrams seeing 
    you whilst you are praying, there is no sin on you for that, and your prayer 
    is valid so long as you are covered properly and wearing hijaab. When a 
    woman prays, she must cover all her body except her face and hands, if she 
    is in her own house or among her mahrams. But if she is in a place where non 
    mahrams could see her, she must cover all of her body including the face and 
    hands. We should also note that a woman should try to keep away from places 
    where men and women mix and places that are just for men, especially at 
    times of worship. 

    If sounds of music, swearing or other haraam sounds reach you 
    whilst you are praying, this does not affect the validity of your prayer, so 
    long as you are able to perform all the necessary and obligatory parts of 
    the prayer. But you should keep away from places where these haraam things 
    are likely to be, as much as possible, especially when performing the 
    prayers, because this is more conducive to having the proper humble and 
    focused attitude, and to pondering the meaning of the words you are 
    reciting. 

    There is nothing wrong with praying near your desk so long as 
    you are able to perform all the necessary and obligatory parts of the 
    prayer.

    especially the prayer. We also appreciate your keenness to learn and your

10455,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10455,Greater and lesser jihaad,"Which is the greater jihad, jihad with one's nafs or jihad in the battlefield ?",,,"Praise be to Allah.It was narrated that the 
          Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
          Allaah be upon him), said to his companions when they returned from 
          a military campaign, “We have come back from the lesser jihaad to the 
          greater jihaad.” They said, “Is there any greater jihaad than jihaad 
          against the kuffaar?” he said, “Yes, jihaad al-nafs (jihaad against 
          the self).” 
This hadeeth is not saheeh.  
Undoubtedly jihaad against 
          the self comes before jihaad against the kuffaar, because one cannot 
          strive against the kuffaar until after one has striven against one’s 
          own self, because fighting is something which the self dislikes. Allaah 
          says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Jihaad (holy fighting in 
          Allaah’s Cause) is ordained for you (Muslims) though you dislike it, 
          and it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you and that 
          you like a thing which is bad for you. Allaah knows but you do not know”[al-Baqarah 
          2:216]
The point is that jihaad 
          against the enemy cannot take place until one strives and forces oneself 
          to do it, until one’s self submits and accepts that.  
Fataawa Manaar al-Islam by Shaykh 
          Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him), 2/421  
Ibn al-Qayyim said: “Jihaad 
          is of four stages: jihaad al-nafs (striving against the self), 
          jihaad al-shayaateen (striving against the shayaateen or devils), 
          jihaad al-kuffaar (striving against the disbelievers) and jihaad 
          al-munaafiqeen (striving against the hypocrites).  
Jihaad al-nafs 
          means striving to make oneself learn true guidance, and to follow it 
          after coming to know it, calling others to it, and bearing with patience 
          the difficulties of calling others to Allaah. Jihaad al-Shaytaan 
          means striving against him and warding off the doubts and desires that 
          he throws at a person, and the doubts that undermine faith, and striving 
          against the corrupt desires that he tries to inspire in a person. Jihaad 
          against the kuffaar and munaafiqeen is done in the heart and on the 
          tongue, with one’s wealth and oneself. Jihaad against the kuffaar mostly 
          takes the form of physical action, and jihaad against the munaafiqeen 
          mostly takes the form of words… The most perfect of people are those 
          who have completed all the stages of jihaad. People vary in their status 
          before Allaah according to their status in jihaad.”(Zaad al-Ma’aad

The evidence for this version is the hadith narrated by Ahmad (15881) and Abu Dawud from ‘Abd-Allah ibn Zayd, who said:  
When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ordered that a bell should be made so that it could be struck to call the people to prayer, a man walked around me whilst I was sleeping [i.e., in a dream], carrying a bell in his hand. I said, “O slave of Allah, will you sell this bell?” He asked, “What will you do with it?” I said, “We will call the people to prayer.” He said, “Shall I not tell you of something better than that?” I said, “Yes.” He said, “Say: Allahu akbar, Allah akbar, Allahu akbar, Allah akbar; ash-hadu an la ilah ill-Allah, ash-hadu an la ilaha ill-Allah; ash-hadu anna Muhammadan Rasul-Allah, ash-hadu anna Muhammadan Rasul-Allah; hayya ‘ala al-salah, hayya ‘ala al-salah; hayya 'alal-falah, hayya ‘alal-falah; Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar; La ilaha ill-Allah

Allah is most Great, Allah is most Great, there is no god except Allah).” Then he went a short distance away from me and said: “And when the prayer is about to begin (iqamah), say:

The evidence for this version is the hadith narrated by Abu Dawud (502), al-Tirmidhi (192), al-Nasai (632) and Ibn Majah (709) from Abu Mahdhurah who said:  
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught me the adhan with nineteen phrases and the iqamah with seventeen. The adhan is: 
Allahu akbar, Allah akbar, Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar; ash-hadu an la ilaha ill-Allah, ash-hadu an la ilaha ill-Allah; ash-hadu anna Muhammadan Rasul-Allah, ash-hadu anna Muhammadan Rasul-Allah. Then go back and say out loud:
Ash-hadu an la ilaha ill-Allah, ash-hadu an la ilaha ill-Allah; ash-hadu anna Muhammadan Rasul-Allah, ash-hadu anna Muhammadan Rasul-Allah; hayya ‘ala al-salah, hayya ‘ala al-salah; hayya 'alal-falah, hayya ‘alal-falah; Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar; La ilaha ill-Allah.
And the iqamah is seventeen phrases:
Allahu akbar, Allah akbar, Allahu akbar, Allah akbar; ash-hadu an la ilaha ill-Allah, ash-hadu an la ilaha ill-Allah; ash-hadu anna Muhammadan Rasul-Allah, ash-hadu anna Muhammadan Rasul-Allah; hayya ‘ala al-salah, hayya ‘ala al-salah; hayya 'alal-falah, hayya ‘alal-falah; qad qamat il-salah, qad qamat il-salah;  Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar; La ilaha ill-Allah. (Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud, 474)
This version was favoured by Imam Abu Haneefah (may Allah have mercy on him). 
These two versions were proven in sound narrations from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Whoever does either of them is following the Sunnah. 
Reciting Iqamah with the same number of phrases as Adhan
Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: is it permissible to recite the iqamah with the same number of phrases as the adhan? 
He said: 
“That is permissible, rather that is one of the Sunnahs in pronouncing the adhan , because that was proven in al-Sahih, from the hadith of Abu Mahdhurah (may Allah be pleased with him), when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught him the adhan and iqamah in al-Masjid al-Haram at the time of the Conquest of Makkah. 
It is permissible to mention the phrases of the iqamah once only, apart from the phrase Qad qamat il-salah (prayer is about to begin) and the takbir (Allahu akbar), as Bilal (may Allah be pleased with him) used to do in the Mosque of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), in his presence and and according to his instructions. It is narrated in al-Sahihayn that Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Bilal used to say the phrases of the adhan twice and say the phrases of the iqamah once in the presence of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).” (Majmu’ Fatawa wa Maqalat Mutanawwa’ah, 10/366) 
But in the case of acts of worship for which several ways of doing them have been narrated, it is better for the Muslim not to adhere to one particular way and ignore the rest. Rather the Sunnah is to do everything that has been proven from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). So one time he can say the iqamah of Bilal (may Allah be pleased with him), and another time he can say the iqamah of Abu Mahdhurah (may Allah be pleased with him). 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: 
“The correct view is the view of Ahl al-Hadith and those who agree with them, which is to accept everything that has been narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and not to disapprove of any of these narrations, because the variations in the adhan and iqamah are like the variations in the recitation and tashahhud etc. No one has the right to disapprove of anything that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has prescribed for his ummah. 
In order to follow the Sunnah completely we should do it one way one time and the other way another time, this way in one place and the other way in another place, because forsaking what was narrated in the Sunnah and adhering to something else may lead to regarding what is Sunnah as bid’ah and regarding something that is mustahabb as obligatory, and that would lead to division and disputes if others do it the other way.” (Al-Fatawa al-Kubra, 2/43-44)

    Moving house does not bring good luck or more provision. But 
    if a person lives in a house and some harm comes to him there, then he can

    and other calamities, which made him and his family feel that there is 
    something bad about the house. Is it permissible for him to leave for this 
    reason? 

    He answered: 

    It may be that there is something bad about some houses, 
    vehicles or wives, and Allaah in His wisdom causes a person to suffer some 
    harm or to miss out on some benefit when he is with them. On that basis 
    there is nothing wrong with selling that house and moving to another.

When Allah sent Adam down to the earth and his descendents spread out, He did not forsake them. Rather He gave them provision and sent down to him and his descendents revelation; some of them believed and some of them disbelieved. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (community, nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): ‘Worship Allah (Alone), and avoid (or keep away from) Taghut (all false deities besides Allah).’ Then of them were some whom Allah guided and of them were some upon whom the straying was justified.” [An-Nahl 16:36] 
There are four heavenly books which Allah sent down. They are the Tawrat (Torah), Injil (Gospel ), Zabur (Psalms) and the Quran. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“It is He Who has sent down the Book (the Quran) to you (Muhammad) with truth, confirming what came before it. And He sent down the Tawrat (Torah) and the Injil (Gospel).” [Al `Imran 3:3]  
Allah also says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and to Dawud (David) We gave the Zabur (Psalms)” [Al-Isra’ 17:55] 
Number of the Messengers of Allah
The Prophets and Messengers were many, and no one knows their number except Allah. Among them are those of whom Allah has told us, and some of whom He has not told us. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And Messengers We have mentioned to you before, and Messengers We have not mentioned to you.” [An-Nisa’ 4:164] 
The obligation to believe in the Books and Messengers of Allah
It is obligatory to believe in all the Books which Allah has revealed and in all the Prophets and Messengers whom Allah has sent, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Believe in Allah, and His Messenger (Muhammad), and the Book (the Quran) which He has sent down to His Messenger, and the Scripture which He sent down to those before (him); and whosoever disbelieves in Allah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, and the Last Day, then indeed he has strayed far away.” [An-Nisa’ 4:136] 
Difference between Nabi and Rasool
Rasool (Messenger) and Nabi (Prophet) are two names with the same meaning. It refers to someone whom Allah sent to call the people to worship Allah alone, one of the Prophets and Messengers whom Allah chose and sent to His slaves to convey His religion. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):  
“Messengers as bearers of good news as well as of warning in order that mankind should have no plea against Allah after the (coming of) Messengers.” [An-Nisa’ 4:165] 
Names of Messengers and Prophets mentioned in the Quran
The Prophets and Messengers are many , of whom Allah has mentioned twenty five in the Quran, and we are obliged to believe in all of them. They are: Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, Salih, Ibrahim , Loot, Isma`il, Ishaq, Ya’qub, Yusuf, Shu’ayb, Ayub, Dhu’l-Kifl, Musa, Harun, Dawud, Sulayman, Ilyas, Al-Yasa’, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, ‘Isa and Muhammad – blessings and peace be upon them all. 
Quran is the last revelation
The Quran is the greatest and last of the heavenly Books , and it abrogates the books which came before it and is a witness over them, so we must follow it and ignore those which came before it. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):  
 “And We have sent down to you (O Muhammad) the Book (this Quran) in truth, confirming the Scripture that came before it and Mohaymin (trustworthy in highness and a witness) over it (old Scriptures). So judge among them by what Allah has revealed.” [Al-Ma’idah 5:48] 
What did the Messengers of Allah teach?
Allah chose Messengers and Prophets from among the sons of Adam, and sent them to each nation, and commanded them to call them to worship Allah alone and to explain the ways which would bring happiness in this world and in the Hereafter, and to bring glad tidings of Paradise to those who believed and the warning of Hell to those who disbelieved. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):   
“And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (community, nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): ‘Worship Allah (Alone), and avoid (or keep away from) Taghut (all false deities besides Allah).’ Then of them were some whom Allah guided and of them were some upon whom the straying was justified”[An-Nahl 16:36] 
Allah favoured some of the Prophets and Messengers over others. The best of them are the “Messengers of strong will” who are Nuh, Ibrahim, Musa, ‘Isa and Muhammad; and the best of the Messengers of strong will is Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). For each Prophet was sent only to his own people, until Allah sent Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to all of mankind. He is the last and the best of the Prophets and Messengers, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And We have not sent you (O Muhammad) except as a giver of glad tidings and a warner to all mankind, but most of men know not.” [Saba’ 34:28 – interpretation of the meaning] 
The obligation to follow the example of the Messengers of Allah
The Prophets and Messengers were chosen by Allah to be an example to their nations. He taught them, guided them and honoured them with the Message; He protected them from falling into sin and supported them with miracles. So they are the most perfect of humanity both physically and in their attitude, the best of them in knowledge, the most truthful in speech, the most exemplary in the life they lived. Allah says of them (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And We made them leaders, guiding (mankind) by Our Command, and We revealed to them the doing of good deeds, performing Prayer, and the giving of Zakah and of Us (Alone) they were the worshippers.” [Al-Anbiya’ 21:73] 
Because the Prophets and Messengers reached such a high status of obedience and good character , Allah has commanded us to take them as an example. Allah says ((interpretation of the meaning): 
“They are those whom Allah had guided. So follow their guidance.” [Al-An`am 6:90] 
All of the characteristics of the Prophets and Messengers were combined in our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and Allah honoured him by instilling in him the noblest characteristics. Therefore Allah stated that his example is to be followed in all situations. Allah says ((interpretation of the meaning):  
“Indeed in the Messenger of Allah (Muhammad) you have a good example to follow for him who hopes for (the Meeting with) Allah and the Last Day, and remembers Allah much.” [Al-Ahzab 33:21]  
Belief in all the Prophets and Messengers is one of the pillars of Islamic belief   (`Aqidah), without which the faith of the Muslim cannot be complete, because they all preached the same message, which is belief in Allah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say (O Muslims): ‘We believe in Allah and that which has been sent down to us and that which has been sent down to Ibraaheem (Abraham), Isma`il (Ishmael), Ishaq (Isac), Ya`qub (Jacob), and to Al-Asbat [the offspring of the twelve sons of Ya`qub (Jacob)], and that which has been given to Musa (Moses) and ‘Isa (Jesus), and that which has been given to the Prophets from their Lord.

If the Koran is without error, why are there sects in Islam namely, shuhite& shiite respectively?
Why does the Koran allows polygamy, while the Bible is against it as written in Gen. 2:24 & Matt. 19:5 ?
My soul needs THE TRUTH.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
Allaah often mentions the Messiah ‘Eesa ibn Maryam (Jesus son of Mary) in His Book the Qur’aan for a number of reasons, including the following: 
1.He is one of His Prophets, indeed he is one of the Messengers of strong will whom He sent to His creation and His slaves. It is obligatory to believe in him as in all the other Prophets, as enjoined by Allaah in the verse (interpretation of the meaning):
“Say (O Muslims): We believe in Allaah and that which has been sent down to us and that which has been sent down to Ibraaheem (Abraham), Ismaa’eel (Ishmael), Ishaaq (Isaac), Ya’qoob (Jacob), and to Al-Asbaat [the offspring of the twelve sons of Ya’qoob (Jacob)], and that which has been given to Moosa (Moses) and ‘Eesa (Jesus), and that which has been given to the Prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and to Him we have submitted (in Islam)”
[al-Baqarah 2:136]
2.The first people whom we should be concerned about when calling others to Islam are the People of the Book, i.e., the Jews and the Christians, because they are the closest of later nations to whom the later Messengers were sent. Both the Jews and the Christians knew of the coming of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his attributes were written in their books, the Tawraat (Torah) and Injeel (Gospel). So they should not deny what they find in their books and they should hasten to believe in him, because they already believe in the Messengers who came before him, unlike other nations who worshipped idols. Because they did not believe in the Last Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) as they were enjoined to do, they had to be refuted and shown how they had distorted the message of divine Oneness (Tawheed). This is why they are frequently mentioned in the verses of the Qur’aan.
3.Tawheed (the Oneness of God) is the basic principle upon which everything else, both religious and worldly affairs, is to be built; through Tawheed people will be saved from Hell and admitted to Paradise. This means affirming that Allaah is One. We see that the Jews and Christians differed concerning ‘Eesa ibn Maryam. The Jews said that he was a charlatan who told lies about God, so he had to be killed. The Christians differed from them greatly; some of them said that he was God, and some of them said that he was the son of God, but was one with Him in the Trinity, so that outwardly he appeared to be the son of God but he was in fact God. And some of them said that he was the third person of the Trinity which is a rejection of Tawheed. Others said that he was a Messenger from God and was human like the rest of mankind, but that Allaah singled him out to perform miracles in order to establish proof against people. The last group are the ones who were right. So it was essential to explain the matter and describe ‘Eesa in befitting terms. As with all the other Prophets and Messengers, it is not inappropriate to say that he was a human being, created from clay, whom Allaah chose from among all of mankind to be created without a father, as a manifestation of the power of Allaah to create a man outside the usual means. The likeness of ‘Eesa before Allaah is like Adam, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, the likeness of ‘Eesa (Jesus) before Allaah is the likeness of Adam. He created him from dust, then (He) said to him: ‘Be!’ — and he was”
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:59]
This is the correct belief concerning the creation of the Prophet of Allaah ‘Eesa, which was a miracle for all the people to see. 
But the miracle of Adam’s creation is greater. For ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) was created without a father, but Adam was created without a father or a mother, and this is more expressive of the power of Allaah to create; it is more miraculous than the creation of ‘Eesa (peace be upon him). For all these reasons and others, it was essential to explain the issue of ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) and put matters straight.  
In conclusion, the miracles which Allaah gave to ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) were just like the miracles of all the other Prophets, to prove that he was speaking the truth and that he was truly a Messenger from Allaah. But those who distorted the religion confused the matter for the simple-minded people and used his miracles as a justification to say that he was the son of God or that he was God. All of that is a distortion of the teachings and message of the Messiah (peace be upon him). 
If everyone who follows a Prophet were to take the miracles which Allaah bestowed upon him as a sign that he was a god, then all the Prophets would be gods and each Prophet would be different from the others. For the mountains glorified Allaah along with Dawood (David – peace be upon him), but they did not do so with ‘Eesa. The sea was parted for Moosa (Moses – peace be upon him) and he spoke with his Lord and his Lord spoke with him, so he was known as Kaleem-Allaah (the one who spoke with Allaah), but this did not happen to ‘Eesa (peace be upon him). Allaah flooded the earth in response to the supplication of Nooh (Noah – peace be upon him) and that did not happen to ‘Eesa (peace be upon him). Allaah singled out Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to speak to him and to protect his miracle from being lost or distorted; he alone was sent to all of mankind, and he was given miracles that were not given to ‘Eesa. So how could that be taken to mean that they were all gods? 
Secondly: 
With regard to the view that if the Qur’aan were not distorted there would not be all these many sects such as the Shi’ah and other groups. 
The answer to that is that the Qur’aan cannot force people to choose the right path, because the Qur’aan is simply guidance (and it is up to people to choose). Allaah has warned us about these sects and groups, and He has forbidden us to imitate the nations who became divided in religious matters. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and be not of Al-Mushrikoon (the polytheists, idolaters, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allaah).
Of those who split up their religion (i.e. who left the true Islamic Monotheism), and became sects, [i.e. they invented new things in the religion (Bid‘ah), and followed their vain desires], each sect rejoicing in that which is with it”
[al-Room 30:31-32] 
“And be not as those who divided and differed among themselves after the clear proofs had come to them. It is they for whom there is an awful torment”
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:105]
Allaah has commanded them to adhere to His Book and to follow the Sunnah (way, path) of His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), as He says (interpretation of the meanings): 
“And hold fast, all of you together, to the Rope of Allaah (i.e. this Qur’aan), and be not divided among yourselves, and remember Allaah’s Favour on you, for you were enemies one to another but He joined your hearts together, so that, by His Grace, you became brethren (in Islamic Faith), and you were on the brink of a pit of Fire, and He saved you from it. Thus Allaah makes His Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.,) clear to you, that you may be guided”
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:103]
“O you who believe! Make not (a decision) in advance before Allaah and His Messenger, and fear Allaah. Verily, Allaah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing”
[al-Hujuraat 49:1]
i.e., do not say or do anything that goes against the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
What is meant here is that Allaah forbade the people to split into various groups, and He commanded them to be united, but they followed their own whims and desires, and they cast the Book of Allaah behind their backs, and if they were confused about a verse from the Book of Allaah, they did not refer to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in order to understand it, rather they let their own opinion and corrupt reasoning be the judge. All of that is not from the Qur’aan and not from the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
Thirdly: 
With regard to the question about plural marriage in Islam and its being forbidden in the New Testament, it should be noted that Allaah gave each Messenger his own laws and path. Allaah enjoined Tawheed (belief in the Oneness of Allaah) upon every single Prophet whom He sent, but the laws varied and some of them abrogated others. Some things that were permissible at the time of Adam (peace be upon him) were abrogated at the time of Nooh (peace be upon him).  
The laws that existed at the time of Moosa (Moses – peace be upon him) were partially abrogated at the time of ‘Eesa (Jesus – peace be upon him), as Allaah tells us (interpretation of the meaning): 
“To each among you, We have prescribed a law and a clear way”
[al-Maa’idah 5:48]
So once this is understood, we will realize that plural marriage did not exist only in the law of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), rather it existed in the laws of all the previous Prophets. For example, Ya’qoob (Jabob – peace be upon him) had two wives and was married to two sisters at the same time, according to the Old Testament, as it says in the Book of Genesis 29:15-35. 
The father of the Prophets, Ibraaheem (Abraham – peace be upon him) was also married to two women, Haajar (Hagar) and Saara (Sarah). The Old Testament mentions that the Prophet of Allaah Dawood (David) had seventy or ninety-nine wives, and Sulaymaan (Solomon) had one hundred wives. These and other examples demonstrate that each of the Prophets implemented the laws that Allaah had prescribed. Plural marriage is not only for this ummah (nation – i.e., the Muslims). The fact that the Christians do not allow it may be for two reasons: 
1 – This is one of the laws of Allaah which was binding before the time of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)
2 – They introduced their own innovation and went to extremes in this matter, as in the case of monasticism which they invented and which was not prescribed for them, but they sought to earn the pleasure of Allaah thereby. 
We ask Allaah to guide you and to help you find the true religion, which is Islam, and the path of the Prophet of Mercy (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) according to the understanding of his noble Companions.

“And indeed We sent Noah to his people, and he stayed among them a thousand years less fifty years.”[al-'Ankabut 29:14] 
How did the people of Noah respond to his call?
But the people of Noah did not respond to him and they did not benefit from his advice. Rather their nobles denied his prophethood and accused him of lying, and they said that his followers were from among the poor and weak who had little understanding. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The chiefs who disbelieved among his people said: ‘We see you but a man like ourselves, nor do we see any follow you but the meanest among us and they (too) followed you without thinking. And we do not see in you any merit above us, in fact we think you are liars’” [Hud 11:27] 
Noah continued to call his people, treating them kindly and calling them on every occasion, night and day, in secret and openly, but no one believed with him except for a few. Most of them disbelieved in him and mocked him; they accused him of insanity and tried to stop him from conveying the message of his Lord. They threatened to stone him if he did not stop: 
“They said: ‘If you cease not, O Noah , you will surely be among those stoned (to death)’” [al-Shu’ara 26:116] 
When did Noah start to complain to Allah?
But Noah paid no heed to their threat, and he continued to call them until, when he could no longer bear their mockery and arrogance, he turned to his Lord with this complaint (interpretation of the meaning): 
“He said: ‘O my Lord! Verily, I have called my people night and day (i.e. secretly and openly to accept the doctrine of Islamic Monotheism), but all my calling added nothing but to (their) flight (from the truth). And verily, every time I called unto them that You might forgive them, they thrust their fingers into their ears, covered themselves up with their garments, and persisted (in their refusal), and magnified themselves in pride. Then verily, I called to them openly (aloud). Then verily, I proclaimed to them in public, and I have appealed to them in private. I said (to them): Ask forgiveness from your Lord, verily, He is Oft-Forgiving; He will send rain to you in abundance, And give you increase in wealth and children, and bestow on you gardens and bestow on you rivers.’” [Noah 71:5-12] 
When did Noah start to pray against his people?
When Noah despaired of his people’s ever believing, and they threatened to kill him and they persecuted him and those who believed with him, he had no choice but to pray against them. He said: 
“My Lord! Leave not one of the disbelievers on the earth! If You leave them, they will mislead Your slaves, and they will beget none but wicked disbelievers” [Noah 71:26-27] 
How were the people of Noah punished?
Allah responded to the prayer of Noah and destroyed the people of Noah by drowning them. He commanded him to build a ship of salvation so that he and the believers could ride in it: 
“And it was revealed to Noah : ‘None of your people will believe except those who have believed already. So be not sad because of what they used to do. And construct the ship under Our Eyes and with Our Revelation, and call not upon Me on behalf of those who did wrong; they are surely to be drowned’” [Hud 11:36-37 – interpretation of the meaning] 
When Noah (peace be upon him) had finished building the ship, and the signs of the beginning of the punishment appeared, with water springing up from the ground and water falling from the sky, Allah commanded Noah to take onto the ship one pair, male and female, of every living creature and animal, so that they might continue to survive. He also commanded him to take with him his family, except for those among them who disbelieved – who were one of his wives and one of his sons. And Allah also commanded him to take with him those who believed, who were few in number. 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“(So it was) till when Our Command came and the oven gushed forth (water like fountains from the earth). We said: ‘Embark therein, of each kind two (male and female), and your family — except him against whom the Word has already gone forth — and those who believe. And none believed with him, except a few.’
And he [Noah] said: ‘Embark therein: in the Name of Allah will be its (moving) course and its (resting) anchorage. Surely, my Lord is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.’
So it (the ship) sailed with them amidst waves like mountains, and Noah called out to his son, who had separated himself (apart): ‘O my son! Embark with us and be not with the disbelievers.’
The son replied: ‘I will betake myself to some mountain, it will save me from the water.’ Noah said: ‘This day there is no saviour from the Decree of Allah except him on whom He has mercy.’ And waves came in between them, so he (the son) was among the drowned” [Hud 11:40-43] 
Then Noah was seized with compassion for his son, so he asked his Lord to save him from destruction: 
“And Noah called upon his Lord and said, ‘O my Lord! Verily, my son is part of my family! And certainly, Your Promise is true, and You are the Most Just of the judges.’
He said: ‘O Noah! Surely, he is not of your family; verily, his work is unrighteous, so ask not of Me that of which you have no knowledge! I admonish you, lest you should be one of the ignorant’” [Hud 11:45-46 – interpretation of the meaning] 
When Allah had destroyed the unbelievers by drowning , He commanded the earth to swallow up the water and He commanded the sky to withhold its rain. Then the ship came to rest on Mount Judi in Mosul. The matter was settled and the wrongdoers were destroyed: 
“And it was said: ‘O earth! Swallow up your water, and O sky! Withhold (your rain).’ And the water was made to subside and the Decree (of Allah) was fulfilled (i.e. the destruction of the people of Noah. And it (the ship) rested on (Mount) Judi, and it was said: ‘Away with the people who are Zalimun (polytheists and wrongdoing)!’” [Hud 11:44 – interpretation of the meaning] 
After the ship had come to rest, Allah commanded Noah and those who were with him to disembark, encompassed with peace and blessings: 
“It was said: ‘O Noah! Come down (from the ship) with peace from Us and blessings on you and on the people who are with you (and on some of their offspring), but (there will be other) people to whom We shall grant their pleasures (for a time), but in the end a painful torment will reach them from Us’” [Hud 11:48 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Thus Allaah helped Noah and those who believed with him, and He destroyed those who disbelieved, and made them a lesson for mankind: 
“And (remember) Noah, when he cried (to Us) aforetime. We answered his invocation and saved him and his family from the great distress.
We helped him against the people who denied Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.). Verily, they were a people given to evil. So We drowned them all” [al-Anbiya 21:76-77 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Then Allah ordained prophethood and the Book among the descendants of Noah and Ibrahim (peace be upon them), as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And indeed, We sent Noah and Ibrahim (Abraham), and placed in their offspring prophethood and Scripture. And among them there are some who are guided; but many of them are Fasiqun (rebellious, disobedient to Allah)” [al-Hadid 57:26]

10471,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10471,Knowledge in Islam,To what extent is Islam concerned with knowledge?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Allah created man and provided him with the tools for acquiring knowledge, namely hearing, sight and wisdom. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And Allâh has brought you out from the wombs of your mothers while you know nothing. And He gave you hearing, sight, and hearts that you might give thanks (to Allâh) [al-Nahl 16:78] 
Islam is the religion of knowledge. The first aayah of the Quran to be revealed enjoined reading which is the key to knowledge. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Read! In the Name of your Lord Who has created (all that exists).
He has created man from a clot (a piece of thick coagulated blood).
Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous.
Who has taught (the writing) by the pen.
He has taught man that which he knew not” [al-‘Alaq 96:1-5] 
In Islam, knowledge comes before action; there can be no action without knowledge, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So know (O Muhammad) that Laa ilaaha ill-Allâh (none has the right to be worshipped but Allâh), and ask forgiveness for your sin, and also for (the sin of) believing men and believing women” [Muhammad 47:19] 
Allah warns every Muslim against speaking without knowledge, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And follow not (O man, i.e., say not, or do not, or witness not) that of which you have no knowledge. Verily, the hearing, and the sight, and the heart of each of those ones will be questioned (by Allâh)” [al-Israa’ 17:36] 
Emphasizing the status of knowledge and the scholars, Allah calls upon the scholars to bear witness to His Oneness, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allâh bears witness that Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), and the angels, and those having knowledge (also give this witness); (He always) maintains His creation in justice. Laa ilaaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the All‑Mighty, the All-Wise” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:18] 
Knowledge and fear of Allah may be attained by knowing His signs and creation. The knowledgeable are those who know that, hence Allah praises them by saying (interpretation of the meaning): 
“It is only those who have knowledge among His slaves that fear Allâh” [Faatir 35:28] 
The scholars occupy a noble status in Islam, and which is higher than the position of others in this world and in the Hereafter. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allâh will exalt in degree those of you who believe, and those who have been granted knowledge” [al-Mujaadilah 58:11] 
Because of the importance of knowledge, Allah commanded His Messenger to seek more of it. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and say: ‘My Lord! Increase me in knowledge’” [Ta-Ha 20:114] 
Allah praises the scholars, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say: ‘Are those who know equal to those who know not?’ It is only men of understanding who will remember (i.e. get a lesson from Allâh’s Signs and Verses)” [al-Zumar 39:9] 
Those who have knowledge are the quickest of people to understand the truth and believe in it: 
“And that those who have been given knowledge may know that it (this Quran) is the truth from your Lord, so that they may believe therein, and their hearts may submit to it with humility”
[al-Hajj 22:54 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Islam calls us to seek knowledge. The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) made seeking knowledge an obligation upon every Muslim, and he explained that the superiority of the one who has knowledge over the one who merely worships is like the superiority of the moon over every other heavenly body. He said that the scholars are the heirs of the Prophets and that the Prophets did not leave behind dinars and dirhams (i.e., money), rather their inheritance was knowledge, so whoever acquires it has gained a great share. And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said that seeking knowledge is a way to Paradise. He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever follows a path in the pursuit of knowledge, Allah will make a path to Paradise easy for him.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, Kitaab al-‘Ilm, 10) 
Islam calls us to learn all kinds of beneficial knowledge. Branches of knowledge vary in status, the highest of which is knowledge of sharee’ah, then knowledge of medicine, then the other fields of knowledge. 
The best of all branches of knowledge are the sciences of sharee’ah through which man comes to know his Lord, and his Prophet and Religion. This is the knowledge with which Allah honoured His Messenger; He taught it to him so that he might teach it to mankind: 
“Indeed, Allâh conferred a great favour on the believers when He sent among them a Messenger (Muhammad) from among themselves, reciting unto them His Verses (the Qur’ân), and purifying them (from sins by their following him), and instructing them (in) the Book (the Quran) and Al‑Hikmah [the wisdom and the Sunnah of the Prophet (i.e. his legal ways, statements and acts of worship)], while before that they had been in manifest error”
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:164 – interpretation of the meaning] 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When Allah wishes good for a person, He makes him understand the religion.” (Agreed upon. Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 69) 
Concerning the matter of paying attention to the Quran and learning and teaching it, the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of you is the one who learns the Quran and teaches it.” (Agreed upon. Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4639) 
There is no goodness in knowledge which is not confirmed by action, or words which are not confirmed by deeds: 
“O you who believe! Why do you say that which you do not do?
Most hateful it is with Allâh that you say that which you do not do” [al-Saff :2-3] 
The ummah needs knowledgeable people at all times and in all places. A nation without knowledge and scholars will live in illusions and sink in darkness and if a person learns what Allah has prescribed, then whoever conceals this knowledge and deprives the ummah of it, Allah will place on him a bridle of fire on the Day of Resurrection, and he will deserve to be cursed, except for the one who repents. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, those who conceal the clear proofs, evidences and the guidance, which We have sent down, after We have made it clear for the people in the Book, they are the ones cursed by Allâh and cursed by the cursers.
Except those who repent and do righteous deeds, and openly declare (the truth which they concealed). These, I will accept their repentance. And I am the One Who accepts repentance, the Most Merciful” [al-Baqarah 2:159-160] 
Knowledge brings a great reward. The one who points the way to something good is like the one who does it. When the knowledgeable person dies, his reward with Allah does not cease when he dies, rather it continues to increase so long as people benefit from his knowledge. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When a man dies, all his deeds come to an end except for three – an ongoing charity, beneficial knowledge or a righteous son who will pray for him.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1631) 
If the scholar spreads his knowledge among the people, he will have a reward like that of those who follow him. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever calls people to right guidance will have a reward like that of those who follow him, without it detracting from their reward in the slightest, and whoever calls people to misguidance will have a burden of sin like that of those who follow him, without it detracting from their burden in the slightest.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2674) 
Proper understanding of Islam is one of the best of good characteristics with which a Muslim may be honoured, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When Allah wishes good for a person, He makes him understand the religion.” (Agreed upon). 
Reading Quran, learning it and teaching it, are among the best deeds, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There should be no envy (hasad) except between two people, a man to whom Allah has given (knowledge of) the Quran, so he recites it night and day, and a man to whom Allah has given wealth, so he spends it (in good deeds) night and day.”  (narrated by Muslim, 815)",From Usool al-Deen al-Islami by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem al-Tuwayjri
10488,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10488,Maximum period for nifaas is 40 days,What is the longest that nifaas (post-partum bleeding) can last?,,,"Praise be to Allah.There is a difference of opinion among the scholars concerning that. 
1 – Most of the scholars said that the longest that nifaas can last is 40 days; if the bleeding lasts longer than that then it is istihaadah (irregular vaginal bleeding) unless it coincides with her regular period. This is the view of Abu Haneefah and Ahmad, according to one report, and is the well known view of his madhhab. This was also the ruling given by al-Tirmidhi in his Jaami’, narrating from Sufyaan, Ibn Mubaarak, Ishaaq and most of the scholars. 
2 – Maalik, al-Shaafa’i and Ahmad, according to one report, said that the longest it may last is 60 days. 
3 – al-Hasan al-Basri said that it may last between forty to fifty days; if it lasts longer than that then it is istihaadah. 
4 – There are other opinions but these are cases of ijtihaad for which there is no saheeh evidence apart from the first view. It was proven that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with them both) said: “The woman in nifaas should wait for approximately forty days.” (Narrated by Ibn al-Jaarood in al-Muntaqa). 
Ahmad, Abu Dawood, al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Maajah narrated via Massah al-Azdiyyah that Umm Salamah said: “At the time of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), the woman in nifaas would wait for forty days…” 
There is some dispute concerning this isnaad. Ibn Qattaan classed it as da’eef (weak) in Bayaan al-Wahm wa’l-Ayhaam, as did Ibn Hazm. Al-Haakim classed it as saheeh and al-Nawawi and others classed it as hasan. 
Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Istidhkaar, with regard to the maximum period of nifaas there is no opinion to be followed  except the opinion of those who say that it is forty days. This is the view the companions of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and there was no dispute among them concerning this matter. All other opinions are those of people other than the Sahaabah, and in our view no other opinion can be counted because the consensus of the Sahaabah is evidence for those who came after them. Usually everyone feels comfortable with their opinion; how could anyone hold a different view with no evidence from the Sunnah? This view is the correct one, and that is for a number of reasons: 
1-It is the view of the Sahaabah and no one has the right to go against them.
2-It is essential in this case to define a number of days during which a woman may remain in nifaas; it is not permissible to ignore the view of the Sahaabah and accept someone else’s view.
3-This is the view of doctors who are specialized in knowledge of this bleeding. Their view coincides with that of Ibn ‘Abbaas and of most of the scholars.
 With regard to the minimum length of nifaas, most of the scholars have not set any limit for that. If the woman sees that she is pure (taahir) – which is when the bleeding stops – then she should do ghusl and start praying. 
Imaam Abu ‘Eesa al-Tirmidhi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Jaami’ that the view of the scholars among the Sahaabah, Taabi’een and those who came after them was that the woman in nifaas should not pray for forty days unless she sees that she is pure before that, in which case she should do ghusl and start praying.",Islam Q&A

          With regard to science (apart from the sciences of sharee’ah), i.e., 
          extracting metals and minerals, agricultural science and all beneficial 
          sciences, it may be obligatory to learn of them that which the Muslims 
          need, and it is fard kifaayah. The ruler should enjoin that which the 
          Muslims need, and help the specialists in that field to achieve that, 
          i.e., by helping them to do that which will benefit the Muslims and 
          strengthen them against their enemies. A person’s deeds will be rewarded 
          according to his intentions. It will be counted as an act of worship 
          to Allaah if his intention is correct and sincere. If he does it without 
          any intention it will be counted among permissible deed, I mean permissible 
          kinds of manufacturing, extracting minerals, agriculture, etc… 
 
          All of these are essential matters, but if they are done with the proper 
          intention they may also be acts of worship. If there is no such intention 
          then they may be permissible things. They may be fard kifaayah in some 
          cases, if necessity calls for that. The ruler has to demand that of 
          whoever is qualified to do it, because they are essential matters and 
          there is a need for that. They differ according to intention and according

With regard to dhikr recited in unison, the Standing Committee was asked about du`a and dhikr recited in unison, and they answered: 
The basic principle concerning dhikr and acts of worship is that there is no room for adding or subtracting anything. Allah should only be worshipped in the ways that He has prescribed; this applies whether it is something that can be done at any time or something that is limited to a specific time and how it is to be done and how many times it is to be done. With regard to dhikrs and du`as that Allah has prescribed and all kinds of worship that are not limited with regard to time and numbers, location or a particular way in which they are to be done, it is not permissible for us to adhere to a particular way, time or number; rather we are to do these acts of worship without restrictions as it was prescribed.  
In matters where it isproven in the words or deeds of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that an action is to be done at a certain time or a certain number of times or in a certain place or in a certain manner, then we should worship Allah in accordance with what has been prescribed. It has not been proven from the words or deeds or approval of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that he recited du`a in unison with others following the prayers, or after reading Quran, or following each lesson, whether that took the form of the imaam reciting du`a and the congregation saying Ameen to his du`a, or whether they all recited du`a together in unison. That was not known at the time of the Rightly-Guided Khaleefahs or any of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them). Whoever adheres to the practice of reciting du`a in unison following the prayers or after reading Quran or after every lesson has innovated something and introduced into the religion something which is not a part of it. It was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever innovates something in this matter of ours (i.e. Islam) that is not part of it will have it rejected.” And he said: “Whoever does something that is not in accordance with this matter of ours (Islam) will have it rejected.” 
If it were prescribed to adhere to a certain way of doing it, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his successors (khulafa’) after him would have adhered to that. We have stated above that no such thing was proven from him or from his companions (may Allah be pleased with them). All goodness is to be found in following the guidance of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the guidance of the Rightly-Guided Khulafa’ (may Allah be pleased with them); all evil is to be found in going against their guidance and following the innovated matters against which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) warned us by saying, “Beware of newly-innovated matters, for every innovation is misguidance.” May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions, and grant them peace.

Haram meat in Islam


Cases when Muslims can consume ostrich meat","Praise be to Allah.Is ostrich meat halal?
Yes, it is permissible to eat ostrich meat, because Allaah has blessed His slaves by subjugating to them that which is in the heavens and on earth.
It is difficult to enumerate all the animals that we are permitted to eat. The basic principle concerning all of them is that in general they are permissible, except for those which have been excluded. 
Haram meat in Islam
We may list the animal meat which is haram as follows:
1. Pigs – they are haram according to the texts of the Quran and Sunnah, and there is scholarly consensus on this point.
2. All carnivores which have fangs, such as lions, tigers, leopards, wolves, dogs, etc.
3. All birds which have talons , such as hawks, falcons, vultures, eagles, Indian falcons, etc.
It was narrated from Ibn 'Abbas that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade all carnivorous animals which have fangs and all birds which have talons. (Narrated by Muslim, 1934)
4. Domesticated donkeys
It was narrated that ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade mut’ah (temporary marriage) in the year of Khaybar and he forbade the meat of domesticated donkeys.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5203; Muslim, 1407)
5. Animals which we are commanded to kill , such as snakes, scorpions and mice.
6. Things which are abominable or repulsive. One of the basic principles concerning halal and haram is paying attention to what is regarded as good and what is regarded as repulsive. Al-Shafi'i believed this to be the most important and most comprehensive principle. The basis for this is the ayat (interpretation of the meanings):
“and prohibits them as unlawful Al Khabaith (i.e. all evil and unlawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods)” [al-A'raf 7:157]
“They ask you (O Muhammad) what is lawful for them (as food ). Say: ‘Lawful unto you are At Tayyibat [all kinds of Halal (lawful good) foods which Allah has made lawful (meat of slaughtered eatable animals, milk products, fats, vegetables and fruits)]’” [al-Maidah 5:4]
Cases when Muslims can consume ostrich meat
On this basis, ostrich meat is permitted beyond any shadow of a doubt. The fuqaha have stated that ostrich meat is permissible under several subject headings, including:
(a) al-dhabh (slaughtering meat): when discussing that which makes the animal more at ease, they said: it should be cut in the neck if it has a short neck, and at the point where the neck meets the chest if it has a long neck, such as a camel, ostrich or goose, because that makes it easier for the soul to depart.
(b) The penalty of hunting by a muhrim (one who is in a state of ihram for Hajj or ‘umrah). Al-Shafi'i said: if the muhrim catches an ostrich, then a sacrifice must be offered for that. (al-Umm, 2/210)
(c) The permissibility of different parts of it. Ibn Hazam said: Whoever swears that he will not eat eggs does not break that vow unless he eats the egg of a chicken in particular; the vow is not broken by his eating the egg of an ostrich or any other bird, or fish eggs, because of that which we have mentioned. This is the view of Abu Hanifah, al-Shafi'i and Abu Sulayman. (al-Muhalla, 6/327)
Note: Al-Fayumi said:
“The word ostrich (na’amah) applies to both male and female; the plural is na’am.” (al-Misbah al-Munir, p. 615)
