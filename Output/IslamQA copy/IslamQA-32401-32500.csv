32436,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/32436,How can she teach her five-year-old sister to memorize Qur’aan?,"I have a sister who is five and half years old and I want to teach her to memorize Qur’aan. Where should I start with her, and how?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Raising children to follow Islam from an early age, teaching 
    them to memorize the Book of Allaah and educating them is the Sunnah of the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and is regarded as 
    a very important matter, especially in this day and age. But it is something 
    that many people neglect with regard to their children and those under their 
    care, and they get distracted by things that will be of no benefit to them 
    in the Hereafter and may indeed harm them, and make them emotionally 
    attached to those who do not even deserve to be mentioned, let alone taken 
    as role models, such as actors, sports players and singers. 

    We appreciate our sister’s question and we ask Allaah to make 
    her steadfast and to help her in this matter and others, and to decree 
    reward for her on the Day of Judgement. What can be greater than meeting 
    one's Lord with a record of good deeds which includes guiding others to do 
    good or sharing in establishing good? 

    With regard to this little sister and teaching her to 
    memorize Qur’aan, we advise our sister to do the following: 

    1-Start with that which is 
    easiest to read and memorize, namely Soorat al-Faatihah, then with the last 
    juz’, working from the end. Starting with something easy helps one to move 
    on to more difficult material. Moreover she will have a real need for that 
    when she starts to learn the prayer.

    2-The amount to be memorized 
    every day should be small, so that she will be able to memorize it and it 
    will be easy for her to memorize what comes next. This amount will vary from 
    one child to the next, depending on his or her intelligence and memory.

    3-Review often so that what has 
    been memorized will stick. Do not let any day go by without memorizing 
    something new and reviewing the old.

    4-Encourage her by giving her a 
    prize every time she finishes a juz’ – for example – and memorizes it well.

    5-Start to move from prompting 
    her and having her repeat, which is usually the first stage in memorization, 
    to teaching her how to read, so that it will be easy for her to read the 
    Qur’aan by herself at times when her sister or teacher are not present.

    6-Let her get used to reciting 
    what she has memorized in her prayer, whether that is obligatory or naafil 
    prayer, once she reaches an age where prayer is required of her and she can 
    understand it.

    7-Let her get used to listening 
    to what she has memorized on tapes or on the computer, so that she can hear 
    both a good pronunciation and good recitation, and she can review and 
    consolidate what she has learned.

    8-Choose a good time for 
    memorization when there are few distractions – such as after Fajr or between 
    Maghrib and ‘Isha’. Avoid times when she is hungry, tired or sleepy.

    9-Praise her for what she has 
    memorized in front of neighbours and relatives, so as to encourage her and 
    encourage them to do the same thing; at the same time, pray for refuge for 
    her with Allaah for fear of the evil eye and envy (hasad).

    10-It is essential for 
    her to have one style of Mus-haf with no changes, so that the layout of the 
    verses will be imprinted in her memory.

    11-You should encourage 
    her to write out what she has memorized so that she may combine learning how 
    to write with reinforcing what she has memorized.

But I don't think I can as I do not trust him anymore.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Our sister, may Allaah grant you relief from your distress, 
    make things easier for you, and guide you to that which is good. 

    One of the decrees of Allaah is that He tests His slaves in 
    this world to see if they are patient and content (with His decree). 

    “Great rewards come from great tests. When Allaah loves 
    people, He tests them, and whoever accepts that earns Allaah’s pleasure, and 
    whoever is angry with that earns Allaah's wrath.” 

    (Hadeeth narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2396; classed as hasan by 
    al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 146). 

    So be patient and seek reward. 

    With regard to what you mention about your husband, it is 
    regrettable. He has committed three haraam actions: 

    1 – Not spending on you and your children. The husband is 
    commanded to spend on his wife and children. If he fails to do that then the 
    wife has the right to refer the matter to the court, and she may also ask 
    for divorce. 

    2 – His neglecting to look after his household and children 
    is a sin on him, even if he claims that this is for the sake of da’wah, 
    because his soul has a right over him, and his wife has a right over him, 
    and his Lord has a right over him. He must give each of them his right. The 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) regarded neglect of 
    those who are under one’s care as a sin, and he  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “It is sufficient sin for a man to neglect those 
    whom he supports.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 1692; classed as hasan by 
    al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 1484. 

    Raising children and looking after them and the house is a 
    trust that rests on the father’s shoulders. The Messenger of Allaah  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Each of you is a shepherd 
    and each of you is responsible for his flock… the man is the shepherd of his 
    household and is responsible for his flock.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 893; 
    Muslim, 1829.

    3 – Taking drugs is a haraam action, and indeed is a major 
    sin. It corrupts a person’s religious commitment and his worldly interests, 
    as well as damaging the body and mind, wasting money, and destroying honour. 
    It includes all kinds of evil. 

    So beware of opening the door to it and falling in its trap. 

    How many households has it destroyed, how many people has it 
    killed, how many blessings has it ruined, how much calamity has it brought 
    about! 

    When people fall into the trap of drugs, hardly any are saved 
    therefrom, except those upon whom Allaah bestows His mercy and guidance. 

    With regard to your desire for divorce, if your husband is 
    sincere in his repentance and truly regrets what he has done, and is 
    determined to reform himself, and if you still want him, then be patient and 
    seek reward for staying with him. Perhaps Allaah will reform him, especially 
    if he has asked you to stay with him and to wait for him. The fact that you 
    have children together may also make you think more carefully before you ask 
    for a divorce, because it is better for children to be raised with both 
    their father and their mother than for them to be raised by one parent 
    only. 

    If the man is sincere in his repentance and his regret (of 
    the past), then it is better for you to be patient and to wait until he 
    comes out of prison, because that is in his interests and in the interests 
    of your children, and also in your own interests. 

    But if you cannot bear to be patient and to stay without a 
    husband for this length of time (one year), or if the man is not sincere in 
    his repentance, there is no sin on you in that case if you seek a divorce, 
    and there is nothing good in your staying with him when he is persisting in 
    that sin. 

    You have to make a great deal of du’aa’ to Allaah, and seek 
    His guidance by praying istikhaarah before you take any step. For 
    information on how to pray istikhaarah, please see questions no.

The details of each method vary according to the situation of the debtor. 
Shaykh Muhammad al-‘Uthaymeen said: 
Is it permissible to go to the creditor and give him his money without the knowledge of the debtor? 
The answer is: yes, that is permissible, because this comes under the heading of Allah’s words (interpretation of the meaning): “and for those in debt” [Al-Tawbah 9:60] 
If someone were to say: Is it better for us to give it to the debtor so that he can give it to the creditor, or should we give it to the creditor? The answer is that it depends. 
If the debtor is trustworthy and is keen to pay off his debt, then it is undoubtedly better to give it to him so that he can pay it himself, so that he will not be embarrassed or shamed in front of others. 
But if there is the fear that this money may be misused, then we should not give it to him, rather we should go to the creditor who has asked for it and pay it off on his behalf. 
Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 6/234, 235. 
It should be noted that the debtor is the one who is indebt because he is unable to spend [due to poverty], or to reconcile between two who are disputing, and the like. 
The scholars of the Standing Committee said: 
If a person borrows money because of necessity – such as to build a house to live in, or to buy suitable clothes, or for those on whom he is obliged to spend, such as his parents, children or wife, or to buy a vehicle to use for his work so that he can spend from its earnings on himself or on those on whom he is obliged to spend, and he does not have the money to pay off this loan, then he is entitled to be given zakah money to help him pay off his debt. 
But if he has taken out a loan in order to buy land that will be a source of riches for him, or to buy a car so that he looks well off or as a luxury, then he does not deserve to be given zakah money.

But what are the days when it is not permissible for me to fast?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.We ask Allaah to help you, and to accept your fasting. 
Concerning the virtue of the fast of Dawood (peace be upon him), al-Bukhaari (1079) and Muslim (1159) narrated from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The dearest of prayer to Allaah is the prayer of Dawood (peace be upon him) and the dearest of fasting to Allaah is the fast of Dawood. He used to sleep half the night, pray one-third of it, and sleep one-sixth of it, and he used to fast one day and not the next (i.e., fast alternate days).” 
With regard to the days on which it is not permissible for you to fast, they are the day of Eid al-Fitr, the day of al-Adha and the days of Tashreeq which are the three days after the day of al-Adha. 
That is because of the hadeeth narrated by al-Bukhaari (1889) and Muslim (1920) from ‘Ubayd the freed slave of Ibn Azhar who said: “I witnessed Eid with ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with him) and he said, ‘These are two days which the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade us to fast: the day when you break your fast and the other day when you eat of your sacrifices.’” 
And al-Bukhaari (1884) narrated that ‘Aa’ishah and Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with them) said: “There is no concession allowing anyone to fast on the days of al-Tashreeq except the one who does not have an animal to sacrifice.”

Those who believed, and used to fear Allah much (by abstaining from evil deeds and sins and by doing righteous deeds)” [Yoonus 10:62-63]
But it is not possible to be certain that a particular individual is one of the awliya’ of Allah, because achieving true faith and piety are matters of the heart that are hidden, and people cannot find out about them. Hence it is possible to think that someone is likely to be a wali, but it is impossible to be certain. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
All Muslims should measure the deeds of those who are claimed to be awliya’ by that which is in the Qur’aan and Sunnah. If they are in accordance with the Qur’aan and Sunnah, then we hope that he is one of the awliya’ or close friends of Allah, but if they go against the Qur’aan and Sunnah, then he is not one of the awliya’ of Allah. Allah has mentioned in His Book the fair standards by which His awliya’ may be known, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“No doubt! Verily, the Awliyaa’ of Allah, no fear shall come upon them nor shall they grieve.
Those who believed, and used to fear Allah much (by abstaining from evil deeds and sins and by doing righteous deeds)” [Yoonus 10:62-63]
Whoever is a believer and is pious is a close friend of Allah, and whoever is not like that is not a close friend of Allah. If he has some faith and piety then he is a friend of Allah to some extent.

1 – It is not permissible to issue laws that limit the freedom of couples to have children.
2 – It is haraam to remove the ability of men and women to have children, which is known as sterilization, so long as there is no need to do so according to shar’i principles.
3 – It is permissible to use temporary means of contraception in order to increase the gaps between pregnancies, or to stop them for a limited period of time, if there is a valid shar’i reason for doing so, based on the couple’s estimation and with mutual consultation and agreement, subject to the condition that this does not result in harm and that the means is acceptable according to sharee’ah and will not damage any existing pregnancy.

32487,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/32487,They want to get married according to Hindu tradition,"I ask Allah to guide the believers who imitate the disbelievers. My sister’s wedding is approaching, and she has decided to have a party before the wedding that is a pre-wedding celebration in which the bride sits on a chair, with fruit and other food near her, and men and women attend the party to feed her, then they place a special kind of adornment on her head. These are Hindu traditions, in which the Muslims in South Asia imitate them nowadays.
My parents have agreed to that. I hope that you will pray to Allah to guide the Muslims so that they will not persist in committing sins, and so that Allah might admit them to Paradise.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly:
It is clear from the question that there are two things that are contrary to Islamic teachings. The first is imitation of the Hindus, who are disbelievers. It is not permissible for a Muslim to imitate others in matters that are uniquely theirs, such as some types of clothing, celebrations, festivals and so on.
One of the reasons behind the prohibition of imitating the disbelievers is so that this will not have an impact on the thinking of the one who imitates them, because when a person imitates people outwardly, it will have an impact on him inwardly, until he almost thinks of himself as being the same as those whom he is imitating. [Another reason for the prohibition on imitating others] is so that the Muslim will be distinct from the disbeliever, so that the Muslims will not lose dignity and the disbelievers will not be held in high esteem.
Regarding matters such as this, Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said, explaining the situation of those who wear the zunar belt, which was a type of belt that was worn exclusively by non-Muslims in the past:
The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.” Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The least that may be understood from this hadith is that it is prohibited, although the apparent meaning indicates that the one who imitates them is a disbeliever.
Therefore imitating them is not merely disliked (makrooh), because it is an imitation of the zunar belt of the Christians and that would mean that it is haraam, because the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.” But that does not mean that he becomes a disbeliever; rather he is one of them in terms of his dress and appearance, which makes it almost impossible to differentiate between a man who is imitating the Christians in his appearance and dress, and a man who is a Christian, so he becomes one of them in terms of his outward appearance.
They said: There is something else, which is that imitating them outwardly may lead to imitating them inwardly, and that is indeed the case, for if a person imitates them outwardly, he will feel that he is in harmony with them, and that he does not dislike them, and that will lead to him imitating them inwardly, so he will  lose his religious commitment.
The correct view is that wearing it is haraam.
Ash-Sharh al-Mumti‘ (2/192-193)
Secondly:
The second reprehensible matter in the celebration mentioned in the question is the matter of men entering upon the bride when she is wearing her adornments, and the free mixing of men and women in the celebration. Both of these matters are haraam.
It was narrated from ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Aamir that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Beware of entering upon women.” A man among the Ansaar said: O Messenger of Allah, what about the in-law? He said: “The in-law is death.”
Narrated by al-Bukhaari (4934) and Muslim (2173).
An-Nawawi said: With regard to the words of the Prophet (blessings and peace be upon him), “The -in-law is death,” what is meant is that the fear of (harm from) him is greater than the fear of (harm from) others, and the possibility of evil and fitnah from him is greater, because he is able to reach the wife and be alone with her, without anyone objecting to him, in contrast to the case of one who is a stranger. What is meant by the in-law here is the relatives of the husband, apart from his father and grandfather, and his sons and grandsons. Those who are mahrams to his wife, such as his father or sons, are permitted to be alone with her, and they are not described as “death”. Rather what is meant here is the husband’s brother, nephew, paternal uncle, cousins and so on, who are not mahrams (to his wife) and   regarding whom people are usually lenient, so a man may be alone with his brother’s wife. This is what is described as death, and it is more appropriate that they not be allowed to approach the woman than one who is a stranger, because of what we have mentioned above. This that I have mentioned is the correct meaning of the hadith.
Sharh Muslim (14/153).

In light of this atmosphere, should we Muslim not be the most open and honest about our shortcomings and try to tackle them as opposed to being overly defensive and seeming to make excuses or cover our faults? The reason for this question is that if we seem to deny or gloss over obvious shortcomings it will not help us to overcome them. Perhaps some Muslims feel that to deal with our problems openly will assist the kufaar in their attacks on Islam. Please advise.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
There are no weak points in Islam – praise be 
    to Allaah – that the Muslim needs to worry about. Islam is the perfect religion of Allaah, and Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And the Word of your Lord has been 
    fulfilled in truth and in justice”
[al-An’aam 6:115]
One of the scholars said that this means, it tells the truth in its reports and is just in its 
    rulings. 
Allaah has blessed us by completing His 
    religion and perfecting the blessing, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“This day, I have perfected your religion 
    for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion”
[al-Maa'idah 5:3]
If an Islamic ruling seems to a person to be 
    a weak point, he should realize that the fault lies in his way of thinking, because some of the rulings of sharee’ah that are absolutely wise and 
    just may appear otherwise to some people, either because of their whims and desires, or because it goes against what people are used to in their 
    lives, that goes against sharee’ah. For example, some think that a man’s being the protector and maintainer of women is a weak point in Islam, 
    because they are used to something which is contrary to that and which also goes against the fitrah (natural inclination of man).  
Secondly: 
An important matter which should be pointed 
    out here is that it is not permissible for anyone to speak about the rulings of Islam or the tafseer of Qur’aan or the meanings of hadeeth, rather 
    that should be referred to the scholars who are well-versed in knowledge. 
What happens is that a question is put to an 
    ordinary Muslim, and he cannot find an answer for it or he gives a wrong answer, or it leaves some doubt in his heart that he cannot rid himself 
    of.  
“if only they had referred it to the 
    Messenger or to those charged with authority among them, the proper investigators would have understood it from them (directly). Had it not been

    meaning]
Hence we say that Allaah has protected the religion for us through the scholars and has enabled 
    them to understand it correctly so as to refute hostile ideas and explain its wisdom to people. That is not for the ordinary people, rather it is 
    only for the elite, namely the scholars. 
Some of scholars used to challenge people to 
    bring them a verse that contradicts another verse or a hadeeth, or a hadeeth that contradicts another hadeeth or a verse of Qur’aan, and they 
    would explain to them anything that appeared to be a contradiction, and they used to openly challenge everyone on this matter. 
Al-Daaraqutni – who was one of the imams of 
    hadeeth – stood in Baghdad as a khateeb and said: “O people of Baghdad! No one can tell lies against the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) whilst I am alive.” These words indicate the depth of their knowledge and understanding of Islam, which was so 
    great that the people of falsehood could not attack Islam or introduce into it things that were not part of it. 
Hence our advice to this questioner and other 
    Muslims, especially those who mix with kuffaar because of their work or because they live in their countries, is to strive to seek knowledge and 
    to learn the correct rulings of Islam that are derived from the Qur’aan and Sunnah, whilst paying attention to learning the reasons behind these 
    rulings, so that they will have knowledge with which to refute the specious arguments of those who seek to attack Islam, and this will enable them 
    to call people to Allaah with proper insight and understanding. 
And Allaah knows best.",Islam Q&A
