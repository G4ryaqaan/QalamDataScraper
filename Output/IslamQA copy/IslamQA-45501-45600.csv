45513,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45513,Ruling on customary (‘urfi) marriage – and is it permissible for the wife to move to another wali at whim?,"My country is fool of aglomerations of evils,this is worse on university campuses, for this reason students want to get married before graduation, the parents are the biggest problem.As for the male we hear that they do not need the permission of thier waliy, as for female we excape this by making a proposal, if the father gives an unislamic reason(e.g i don't want you to marry now,I don't like his tribe,I am not please with his jumping trouser or beard keeping or his religion when the brother is an upright sunni and the sister's waliy is not) then we abandon him for the grandfather or the brother.If they also refuse then we go ahead with the marraige with the amir of our society (MSS;muslims student society) Please is this correct, how is it done. Please explain everything about this act because it is the only way out, and already very common around us , if it is wrong what should those that have done it now do .(some of them now have kids).",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    It is not permissible for a Muslim woman to get married 
    without the permission of her wali (guardian), rather it is essential for 
    her to have a wali who will get her married, because the Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no marriage without a 
    wali.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2085; classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani. 
    And he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Any woman who 
    gets married without the permission of her wali, her marriage is invalid, 
    her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid.” Narrated and classed as 
    hasan by al-Tirmidhi, 1102; Abu Dawood, 2083; Ibn Maajah, 1879 – from the 
    hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel, 
    1840. 

    Al-Tirmidhi said, commenting on that: 

    This is the principle that was followed by the companions of 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), including 
    ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab, ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib, ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Abbaas, Abu 
    Hurayrah and others. Thus it was narrated that some of the fuqaha’ of the 
    Taabi’een such as Sa’eed ibn al-Musayyib, al-Hasan al-Basri, Shurayh, 
    Ibraaheem al-Nakha’i, ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez and others said: There is no 
    marriage except with a wali. This is also the view of Sufyaan al-Thawri, 
    ‘Abd-Allaah ibn al-Mubaarak, Maalik, al-Shaafa’i, Ahmad and Ishaaq. End 
    quote. 

    In the answer to question no. 
    2127 you will find an important 
    summary of the conditions and essentials of marriage, and the conditions to 
    be met by the wali. 

    In the answer to question no. 
    7989 there are further 
    important details concerning the importance of having a wali in order for 
    the marriage to be valid. 

    Secondly: 

    Allaah has commanded walis to marry off the women who are 
    under their care, and not to mistreat them by preventing them from getting 
    married for no legitimate reason. Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “And marry those among you who are single (i.e. a man who 
    has no wife and the woman who has no husband) and (also marry) the Saalihoon 
    (pious, fit and capable ones) of your (male) slaves and maid‑servants 
    (female slaves). If they be poor, Allaah will enrich them out of His Bounty. 
    And Allaah is All‑Sufficient for His creatures’ needs, All‑Knowing (about 
    the state of the people)”

    [al-Noor 24:32]

    Similarly, the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) commanded walis not to prevent the marriage of the woman whom 
    Allaah has placed under their care if a suitor whose religious commitment 
    and character are good comes to propose marriage. He said: “If there comes 
    to you one with whose religious commitment and character you are pleased, 
    then marry (your daughter or female relative under your care) to him, for if 
    you do not do that there will be fitnah and widespread mischief in the 
    land.” Narrated and classed as hasan by al-Tirmidhi, 1084. Classed as hasan 
    by al-Albaani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel, 1868). 

    Both the verse and the hadeeth quoted point clearly to two 
    things: 

    1 – The command to arrange the marriage is addressed to the 
    wali, which indicates that the matter has to do with him and the nikaah 
    cannot be done unless he is involved in giving his female relative or ward 
    in marriage to the one who has proposed marriage. The ahaadeeth that we have 
    quoted clearly indicate this and support it. 

    2 – It is not permissible for a wali to mistreat his ward and 
    deny her her right to marriage; that is a kind of mistreatment that leads to 
    great fitnah that affects both religious commitment and worldly interests. 

    If both the woman and her wali act in accordance with this, 
    the security of the family will be achieved and a great deal of evil will be 
    removed from matters of religion and morals. 

    But if the wali refuses to give her her rights to marriage 
    with no legitimate reason, it is permissible for her to move to another, 
    more distantly-related, wali, such as her older brother, paternal uncle or 
    grandfather, so long as that is done on the orders of the shar’i qaadi, and 
    not by her or by her walis. If there is no wali from her family, it is 
    permissible for the qaadi or someone who is in a similar position to act as 
    her wali and arrange her marriage, because it is narrated that ‘Aa’ishah 
    (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: The Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) said: “Any woman who gets married without the 
    permission of her wali, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid, 
    her marriage is invalid, and if there is a dispute then the person in 
    authority is the wali of the one who has no wali.”  

    Based on this, there is no sin on a woman whose wali denies 
    her her right to marriage if she refers the matter to the Muslim qaadi and 
    appoints her grandfather, paternal uncle or older brother as her wali. 

    Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan was asked about a similar issue and 
    he replied: 

    It is not permissible for a woman to arrange her own 
    marriage. If she arranges her own marriage, then her marriage is invalid 
    according to the majority of scholars, both ancient and contemporary. That 
    is because Allaah, may He be exalted and glorified, addresses walis with 
    regard to the issue of marriage and He says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “and (also marry) the Saalihoon (pious, fit and capable 
    ones) of your (male) slaves”

    [al-Noor 24:32]

    And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said: “If there comes to you one with whose religious commitment and 
    character you are pleased, then marry (your daughter or female relative 
    under your care) to him…” And he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said: “There is no marriage without a wali and two witnesses of good 
    character.” 

    With regard to what the questioner mentions about having read 
    in some books of fiqh that a woman may arrange her own marriage, this is the 
    weaker view, and the correct view is that which is supported by evidence 
    that indicates the opposite.  

    With regard to what she says about her situation and that her 
    opinion goes against her father’s, because her father wants her to marry a 
    man who is of good lineage and status and is compatible with her, whereas 
    she does not think that is important, and rather she is inclined towards 
    marrying a man who she thinks is religiously committed, even if he is not of 
    good lineage and status or compatible with her, her father is in the right 
    in this case, and her father is more far-sighted. She may imagine that this 
    person is good for her when in fact he is not good for her, and she has no 
    right to go against her father’s wishes so long as he is looking out for her 
    best interests. If it happens that another person is good for her and is 
    compatible with her in status, lineage and religious commitment, but her 
    father refuses to give her to him in marriage, then in that case he is being 
    unjust in preventing the marriage, and the role of wali then passes to the 
    next closest guardian among her relatives. But in this case it is essential 
    to refer the matter to the qaadi so that the guardianship may be passed from 
    the unjust father to another wali. Neither she nor any of her other walis 
    has the right to conduct her marriage without the approval of her father. It 
    is essential to refer the matter to a Muslim qaadi who will examine the 
    matter and assess the situation. If he thinks that the guardianship should 
    pass to someone else, he will transfer it, according to what is best. It is 
    essential for things to be done properly with regard to marriage. End quote.

    Al-Muntaqa min Fataawa al-Shaykh al-Fawzaan, 
    5/242, 243 

    Thirdly: 

    Whoever gets married in a manner that is not Islamically 
    acceptable, such as a woman who gets married without a wali, her marriage is 
    invalid and the couple must be separated immediately. The children are to be 
    attributed to the man who married the woman, if they thought that what they 
    did was permissible, but if they knew that their marriage was invalid, then 
    the children must be attributed only to their mother. 

    This invalid marriage leads to many negative consequences, 
    such as: loss of the woman’s rights, because there is no proof of this 
    marriage, so her entitlement to the mahr is not proven, nor is she entitled 
    to maintenance. It also leads to the spread of immorality and corruption in 
    society, especially among students, since it is possible, by means of these 
    false contracts, for every pregnant woman or every man and woman who are 
    found in a dubious situation, to claim that they are married by means of 
    customary marriage. It also means that it is not possible to prove the 
    children’s lineage in such a marriage, which means that they and their 
    lineage will be lost.  

    The way to set this matter straight is to go to the wali and 
    tell him frankly what has happened, then to do the marriage contract again, 
    with his agreement. If he does not agree, then they should be separated.

45514,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45514,Can Muslim Spouses Have Intercourse Naked?,"I was told by Islamic teacher that ""Janabah"" or intimacy of spouses is not permitted if uncovered by sheet or blanket, because angels who are present are ashamed and insulted by naked bodies of spouses in the state of Janabah. So spouses must cover their bodies with a blanket during intimacy and must not uncover naked bodies. I am really confused, because I know Hadiths which are opposite of it. I would appreciate it if you solve this misunderstanding.","There is no authentic Hadith which says that it is forbidden to be naked when having intercourse with one's spouse, and the basic principle is that that is permitted, and there is proof that supports this basic principle.",,"Praise be to Allah.Prohibition is an Islamic ruling which cannot be attributed to the Shari`ah without sound Shar`i evidence that is proven from the Book of Allah or the Sunnah of His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
The majority of Hanafi, Shafi`i and Maliki scholars  (may Allah have mercy on them) are of the view that it is permissible for the spouses to be naked when having intercourse . The Hanbalis are of the view that it is disliked to be naked and not covered when having intercourse, and they quote Hadiths as evidence for that, but none of them are sound, for example: 

Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""When one of you goes in unto his wife, let him be covered, for if he is not covered, the angels feel shy and depart, then if they have a child, the devil will have a share of him."" This was narrated by At-Tabarani in Al-Mu`jam Al-Awsat (1/63), and by Al-Bazzar who classed it as inauthentic, as it says in Nasab Ar-Rayah (4/247).
`Abdullah ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""When one of you goes in unto his wife, let him cover and not be naked like donkeys."" This was narrated by At-Tabarani in Al-Mu`jam Al-Kabir, 10/196, and by Al-Bayhaqi, who classed it as da'eef (weak) (7/193). Its Isnad includes Mandal ibn 'Ali, who is da'eef. 

It was also narrated by Ibn Majah (1921) from the hadith of 'Utbah ibn 'Abd-Allah Al-Sulami, who was classed as inauthentic by Al-Albani in Irwa' Al-Ghalil (2009). 

Abu Umamah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""When one of you goes in unto his wife, let him cover himself and his wife, and not be naked like donkeys."" This was narrated by At-Tabarani (8/164). Its Isnad (chain of narration) includes `Afir ibn Ma'dan who is inauthentic, as was stated in Majma` Az-Zawa'id (4/293). 

As it is established that these Hadiths are inauthentic, it is not valid to quote them as evidence that it is obligatory to be covered and to say that it is forbidden to be naked when having intercourse. The basic principle is that it is permissible for spouses to enjoy looking at and touching one another. 
The majority of scholars have quoted as evidence that it is permissible the Hadith of Bahz ibn Hakim, from his father, from his grandfather, who said: I said, O Messenger of Allah, with regard to our `Awrah, what may we uncover of it and what must we conceal? He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Cover your `Awrah except from your wife and those whom your right hand possesses (i.e., concubines).” I said, O Messenger of Allah, what if the people live close together? He said, “If you can make sure that no one sees it, then do not let anyone see it.” I said, O Messenger of Allah, what if one of us is alone? He said, “Allah is more deserving that you should feel shy before Him than people.”  (Narrated and classed as sound by At-Tirmidhi, 2794 and Ibn Majah, 1920. Classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi) 
They also quoted as evidence an inauthentic Hadith, narrated from `Abdullah ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""Beware of being naked, for you have with you those who never leave you except when you defecate, and when a man goes in unto his wife, so feel shy of them and respect them."" (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 2800. Its Isnad (chain of narration) includes Layth ibn Abu Sulaym, who made mistakes and was classed as inauthentic by Al-Albani in Irwa' Al-Ghalil, 64) 
In conclusion, there is no authentic Hadith which says that it is forbidden to be naked when having intercourse with one's spouse, and the basic principle is that that is permitted, and there is proof that supports this basic principle.

45518,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45518,When should the words al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm (prayer is better than sleep) be said? In the first adhaan or in the second?,"I have been studying with this Shaikh in Dubai for the last two years. He revealed an astonishing so called fact that `As salatu Khairum minan Naoom`in FAJR Adhan is a Bi`da cause Hazarat Bilal use to use these words in TAHAJJUD Adhan and IBN MAKTOUM use to call the FAJR Adhan where by he did not use these words.The other evidence is that, by meaning of these words you are trying to compare SLEEP with FAJR Salat which should not be the case. He also said that Shaikh Albaani had made a Du`aa for the youngsters of today asking ALLAH to give them Hidaya to stop this Bi`da. If my Teacher is correct, why is it being followed in Mecca and Madina as well. Please give me your comments.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is narrated in a number of saheeh ahaadeeth that the words al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm (prayer is better than sleep) are to be said in the adhaan for Fajr. It is mentioned in some of them that this phrase is to be said in the first adhaan without stating what is meant by the phrase “the first adhaan” – is it the adhaan that is given before Fajr or is it the adhaan of Fajr itself? 
These ahaadeeth include the following: 
1 – It was narrated that Abu Mahdhoorah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: I used to give the adhaan for the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and in the first adhaan of Fajr I used to say: “Hayya ‘ala al-falaah, al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm, al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm, Allaahu akbar Allaahu akbar, laa ilaaha ill-Allaah (come to prosperity, prayer is better than sleep, prayer is better than sleep, Allaah is Most Great, Allaah is Most Great, there is no god but Allaah).” 
Narrated by Abu Dawood, 500; al-Nasaa’i, 647; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
2 – It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: In the first adhaan after the word al-falaah it said: Al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm, al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm (prayer is better than sleep, prayer is better than sleep).
 Shaykh al-Albaani said: 
It was narrated by al-Tahhaawi (1/82) with a hasan isnaad as al-Haafiz said in al-Talkhees (3/169). 
Al-Thamr al-Mustataab, p. 131 
These ahaadeeth provide evidence for those who said that this should be said in the first adhaan which comes at the end of the night. But the correct view is that it should be in said the adhaan which comes after the time for prayer has begun. That is for a number of reasons: 
(a)
The word awwal (first) is in relation to the iqaamah, and the iqaamah is the second call to prayer. In the saheeh Sunnah there are reports in which the iqaamah is called an “adhaan”, as in the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Between each two calls (adhaanayn)...” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 598; Muslim, 838. 
In Saheeh Muslim (739) the adhaan which comes after the time for prayer begins is called the first adhaan. This appears in the hadeeth narrated by ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) about the prayer of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). She said: He used to sleep during the first part of the night and wake up during the latter part, then if he had any need for intimacy with his wife he would satisfy that need, then he would sleep. Then when it was the time of the first call, he would wake up and pour water over himself, and if he was not junub he would do wudoo’ as a man does for prayer, then he would pray two rak’ahs. 
What is meant by two rak'ahs here is the regular Sunnah of Fajr, as stated by al-Nawawi in Sharh Muslim. 
(b)
In some saheeh ahaadeeth it is clearly stated that the adhaan in which this phrase appears is called adhaan salaat al-subh, adhaan al-fajr, etc. These phrases indicate that this adhaan should come after the time for the prayer begins and the adhaan that is given at the end of the night comes before the time for prayer begins. These ahaadeeth include the following: 
1 – It was narrated that Abu Mahdhoorah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: I said: “O Messenger of Allaah, teach me the Sunnah of adhaan.” He wiped the front of my head and said: “Say Allaah akbar, Allaahu akbar, Allaah akbar, Allaahu akbar (Allaah is Most Great, Allaah is Most Great, Allaah is Most Great, Allaah is Most Great)… And if it is Fajr prayer, then say: Al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm, al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm (Prayer is better than sleep, prayer is better than sleep). 
According to another, similar report, it says: “Al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm, al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm (Prayer is better than sleep, prayer is better than sleep) in the first adhaan of dawn.” 
Narrated by Abu Dawood, 501; al-Nasaa’i, 633; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
According to another report narrated by Abu Dawood (504) from Abu Mahdhoorah (may Allaah be pleased with him): He used to say in Fajr: “al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm (Prayer is better than sleep). Classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
2 – It was narrated that Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: It is Sunnah for the muezzin, after saying Hayya ‘ala al-falaah (come to prosperity), to say: “al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm (prayer is better than sleep)” twice. 
Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
This was narrated by al-Daaraqutni (90), Ibn Khuzaymah in his Saheeh and al-Bayhaqi in his Sunan (1/423), and he said: its isnaad is saheeh. 
It was also narrated by al-Daraaqutni and al-Tahhaawi (1/82) via Hushaym from Ibn ‘Awn with the wording: In the adhaan for Fajr prayer, when the muezzin said: Hayya ‘ala al-falaah (come to prosperity), he said: “al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm (prayer is better than sleep),” twice. This version was narrated by Ibn al-Sakan who classed it as saheeh, as it says in al-Talkhees, 3/148 
Al-Thamr al-Mustataab, p. 132 
These ahaadeeth show that this phrase appears in the adhaan for Fajr prayer. 
The adhaan which is the call to prayer is that which comes after the time for the prayer has begun, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When the time for prayer begins, then let one of you give the adhaan for you.” Agreed upon. 
As for the adhaan which comes at the end of the night, this is not an adhaan for Fajr prayer as such, rather it is done “so that the one who is praying qiyaam may go back and the one who is asleep may wake up”, as is narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in al-Saheehayn. Thus it is clear that the phrase which appears in the adhaan which comes after the time for the prayer begins is not a bid’ah (innovation), rather it is Sunnah. 
The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked: 
What is the reason why the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), to say al-salaatu khayrun min al-nawm, is not done in the first adhaan for Fajr, as is mentioned in Sunan al-Nasaa’i, Ibn Khuzaymah and al-Bayhaqi? 
They replied: 
Yes, the this phrase should be mentioned in the first adhaan of Fajr, in accordance with the command of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). It is clear from the hadeeth that it is the adhaan that is done when the true dawn comes, and it is called ‘first’ in relation to the iqaamah, which is an adhaan according to sharee’ah, as it says in the hadeeth, “Between every two calls (adhaanayn) there should be a prayer.” The word adhaan here does not refer to the call that is given before the appearance of the true dawn. That call is prescribed in order to wake those who are asleep and so that those who are praying qiyaam may go back. It is not a call to announce the Fajr prayer. Whoever studies the ahaadeeth about this phrase will see clearly that they refer to the adhaan given to announce the time of Fajr, not the adhaan which is given at night just before dawn. End quote.

For more information on the refutation of those who say that this phrase should be said in the adhaan which comes before the time for the prayer begins, please see al-Sharh al-Mumti’ by Shaykh al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him), 2/61-64 
As for the view of your teacher, that this phrase is comparing sleep with Fajr prayer, this is not correct, because this phrase is stating that prayer is better than sleep and thus encouraging the sleeper to stop sleeping and get up to do something that is better.

45519,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45519,Can a woman whose husband has died travel for Hajj during the ‘iddah?,"There is a woman whose husband has died, and she wants to travel for Hajj during the ‘iddah. Is that permissible for her? Please note that she has already performed the obligatory Hajj.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The woman whose husband has died must observe ‘iddah for four 
    months and ten days, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And those of you who die and leave wives behind them, 
    they (the wives) shall wait (as regards their marriage) for four months and 
    ten days”

    [al-Baqarah 2:234]

    During the ‘iddah she must mourn for her husband. 

    Al-Bukhaari (1280) and Muslim (1486) narrated that Umm 
    Habeebah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: I heard the Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “It is not 
    permissible for a woman who believes in Allaah and the Last Day to mourn for 
    anyone who dies for more than three days, except for a husband, for whom she 
    should mourn for four months and ten days.” 

    In the answer to question no.
    13966 we have stated the things 
    that the woman whose husband had died must avoid during the ‘iddah period.  

    These include: going out of the house. 

    She should not go out during the day except in cases of need, 
    and she should not go out at night except in cases of necessity. 

    Her going out for Hajj is not regarded as a necessity, 
    especially since the woman asked about here has already performed the 
    obligatory Hajj. 

    Rather the scholars (may Allaah have mercy on them) have 
    stated that it is not permissible for her to go out to perform the 
    obligatory Hajj. 

    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in 
    al-Mughni (11/303-305): 

    The woman who is observing ‘iddah following the death of her 
    husband has no right to go out for Hajj or for any other purpose. That was 
    narrated from ‘Umar and ‘Uthmaan (may Allaah be pleased with them). It was 
    also the view of Sa’eed ibn al-Musayyib, al-Qaasim, Maalik, al-Shaafa’i, Abu 
    ‘Ubayd, ashaab al-ra’y and al-Thawri. 
If she went out and her 
    husband died on the road, she should go back if she is still close to home, 
    because she comes under the ruling of one who is not travelling. If she is 
    far from home, she may continue her journey. Maalik said: She should go back 
    so long as she has not entered ihraam. 

    The fact that she should go back if she is close to home is 
    indicated by the report narrated by Sa’eed ibn Mansoor from Sa’eed ibn 
    al-Musaayib, who said: Some husbands died, whose wives were performing Hajj 
    or ‘Umrah, and ‘Umar sent them back from Dhu’l-Hulayfah so that they could 
    observe ‘iddah in their houses…  
If a woman has not yet 
    performed the obligatory Hajj and her husband dies, she is still obliged to 
    observe ‘iddah in her house, even if she misses Hajj, because ‘iddah in the 
    house is a one-off event for which there is no alternative, whereas Hajj may 
    be done another year. End quote. 

    It says in al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (29/352): 

    The majority of Hanafi, Shaafa’i and Hanbali fuqaha’ are of 
    the view that it is not permissible for a woman who is observing ‘iddah 
    following the death of her husband to go out for Hajj, because the 
    opportunity for Hajj will come again, whereas ‘iddah is a one-off event. End 
    quote. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was 
    asked about a woman whose husband died and the opportunity to perform the 
    obligatory Hajj came when she was still in mourning, but she was able for it 
    and could afford it, and she had a mahram. Should she perform Hajj or not? 

    He replied: 

    She should not perform Hajj, rather she should stay in her 
    house. In this situation Hajj is not obligatory for her, because Allaah, may 
    He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah) to the House (Ka‘bah) is 
    a duty that mankind owes to Allaah, those who can afford the expenses (for 
    one’s conveyance, provision and residence)”

    [Aal ‘Imraan 3:97]
This woman is not able to 
    do it according to sharee’ah, even if she has a mahram, so she should delay 
    it for one or two years, according to what she is able to do. End quote.

45520,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45520,She feels attracted to someone other than her husband,I am a married woman with kids.My husband treats me very well and takes care of me well.Recenetly one of his relatives a guy almost about 10 years younger than I am and I became very close and before I knew it he fell in love with me.I told him that its not on but his feelings for me grew and grew. I asked him to make Istikaara namaaz and ask Allahs guidance and he did so and he performed his namaaz thrice and all 3 times he got a positive answer with me.I dont see him but I know that since his a very decent boy and sincere. I have also grown to have feelings for him but I try and hide it all the time.Is it possible for me to make istikaara whilst married and also what do we do? Please make duaa for me and help me in this very diffcult situation as I dont want to cause any pain to my husband and my family.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Allaah has caused men to be attracted to women, and women to 
    be attracted to men, and this inclination sometimes results in haraam 
    relationships such as zina, and sometimes it results in permissible 
    relationships such as marriage. Allaah has made the wife a covering for her 
    husband and has made the husband a covering for his wife. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “They are Libaas [i.e. body-cover, or screen, or Sakan 
    (i.e. you enjoy the pleasure of living 
    with them)] for you and you are the same for them”

    [al-Baqarah 2:187]

    One of the blessings that Allaah bestows upon some spouses is 
    that He creates love and compassion between them, and helps each of them to 
    do that which causes harmony to grow in the family and ward off disputes and 
    arguments. This is a very great blessing indeed, which is not appreciated by 
    anyone but those whose family relationships are disrupted and disputes and 
    arguments arise amongst them, which turn the marital relationship into an 
    unbearable hell. If that happens, each spouse starts to dream of a stable 
    family life, and the man wishes for a wife with whom he can live in peace, 
    and the wife wishes for a man with whom she can live in peace. 

    From your question, it may be understood that Allaah has 
    bestowed all these blessings upon you, so what you should do is be grateful 
    to Allaah for this great blessing and strive to preserve it and the family 
    with which Allaah has blessed you, for millions of women wish that they 
    could be in the good situation in which you are, but you do not appreciate 
    its value. 

    You should note that it is not permissible for a woman to 
    form a relationship with a non-mahram man. If she is married, then such a 
    relationship is even more haraam, because it is a transgression against the 
    husband’s rights and honour. 

    Based on this, it is not permissible for you and this evil 
    lover to pray istikhaarah, because istikhaarah is only prescribed in cases 
    where it is not clear if the matter is good or bad, and the Muslim does not 
    know where his interests lie, so he prays istikhaarah asking that Allaah 
    will help him to attain that which is good if it is good, or divert it from 
    him if it is bad. But if a Muslim prays istikhaarah with regard to 
    disobeying Allaah or going against His commands, this is a sin for which he 
    has to repent to Allaah. 

    To explain further: if a Muslim woman prays istikhaarah about 
    marrying someone other than her husband when she is still married to her 
    husband, then in fact she is praying istikhaarah about wrecking her home and 
    family, and praying istikhaarah about hurting her children, and praying 
    istikhaarah about divorcing a husband who is treating her well and taking 
    good care of her. So she is praying istikhaarah about betraying him and 
    stabbing him in the back by tearing apart his family, so that his home and 
    hers will be destroyed at her hands. She is praying istikhaarah about 
    responding to great kindness and good treatment with a great wrong and 
    denying the rights of one who has treated her well. 

    All of these factors and many others apply to the istikhaarah 
    prayer that you offered. 

    As for the positive result that you say your friend got, 
    undoubtedly this is a case of the shaytaan making following one's whims and 
    desires appear attractive. The Muslim should not pray istikhaarah about 
    doing something that is haraam, so how can he pray istikhaarah and claim 
    that he got a positive result?! 

    Moreover, after praying istikhaarah the Muslim should resolve 
    firmly either to do it or not to do it. Whatever Allaah makes easy for him 
    is what is good, but if he waits until he feels good about it or sees a 
    dream and the like, these are usually illusionary matters on which no shar’i 
    ruling can be based. 

    Based on the above, you should push away all whispers from 
    the shaytaan that have to do with this matter, and do not give evil any way 
    of reaching you or your family or children. You should realize that you have 
    fallen into a trap of the shaytaan, because he has made you attractive to 
    this young man and has made him attractive to you so that he may achieve 
    what is his greatest dream, namely the destruction of a stable, believing 
    Muslim family and the divorce of two spouses who love one another, and the 
    neglect of their children. 

    Thwart the plans of the shaytaan by not letting this young 
    man destroy your life and your family. Cut off all means that may enable him 
    to continue to have any place in your life. 

    One of the ways in which you can ward off these devilish 
    whispers is to ask yourself the following questions and answer them 
    honestly: 

    1.If this young man is righteous, 
    then how can he accept to destroy the home of his Muslim brother and split 
    up his family? 

    2.If this person really loves 
    you, why is he striving to wreck your home and destroy your family? Does he 
    love you or does he love himself and is only looking out for his own 
    interests and desires?

    3.If this young man were to get 
    what he wants and you were to get divorced from your husband – Allaah forbid 
    – what would be the fate of your children who are a trust about which Allaah 
    will question you on the Day of Resurrection?

    4.What guarantee do you have that 
    this young man will treat you as nicely after marriage as he does now? It 
    should be noted that many marriages that are based on “love” are doomed to 
    failure after only a few months, because they are based on a weak 
    foundation, not on a foundation of pleasing Allaah and His Messenger  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).

    5.Do you expect that trust will 
    last between you after you get married? If he loves you although you are 
    married, then how can you be sure that he will not fall in love with someone 
    else who is also married or not married? How can he trust you if you 
    destroyed your home for his sake? This pattern may be repeated when you are 
    married to him. These doubts will persist and will be a cause of anxiety for 
    both of you. You have both accepted something haraam and you have not 
    refrained from establishing a haraam relationship even though there is a 
    legitimate marriage contract between you and your husband, so who can 
    guarantee that it will not happen again?

    With regard to your request for a du’aa’, I ask Allaah, the Most High, the Almighty, by His grace and favour, to make goodness easy for you and to ward off all evil from you, and to continue to bless you and your family with stability and love, and to keep you and your husband and children safe, and to ward off from you the whispers of the shaytaan and his making falsehood attractive.

45522,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45522,She claims that her husband raped her daughter and left; is she divorced automatically?,"A muslim woman married a muslim man when her youngest daughter was a few months old. he played the role of father.it has been discovered, after he returned to his country of birth for a visit.that he infact sexually molested the little girl and possibly rape.he denies it..but the medical reports confirm this.after weeks of therapy, the child confirmed that it was him that ""played"" with her..she still thinks it was a cool thing that happened.he has since not returned also sd the authorities are looking for him....QUESTION DOES THIS NULLIFY THE MARRIAGE AUTOMATICALLY? QUESTION: IF NOT -HOW CAN THE MOTHER NULLIFY THIS MARRIAGE.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    Undoubtedly what the husband did to this small child – if it 
    is proven – is a serous crime, for which he deserves to be stoned to death. 
    Perhaps such incidents indicate how far such scum are from the laws of 
    Allaah. Hence the Muslim should be careful with regard to marriage, and he 
    should be caution and be careful about letting female relatives of the wife 
    be alone with people who are weak in faith, even if they are small. 

    Secondly: 

    It is well known that it is not permissible for a man to 
    married at the same time to two sisters, and it is nor permissible for him 
    to marry his wife’s mother – after doing the marriage contract with her – or 
    her daughter – after consummating the marriage with the mother. So if the 
    husband commits zina with the wife’s sister, mother or daughter, does his 
    wife become haraam for him and must he divorce her? And if he was not 
    married to her, is it permissible for him to marry her? These are issues 
    concerning which the scholars differed, and there are three opinions: 

    1.

    The view of the majority is that his wife does not become 
    haraam for him. This is the view of Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with 
    him), ‘Urwah, Sa’eed ibn al-Musayyab and al-Zuhri, and it is the view of the 
    majority of scholars. Some of them narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas said that his 
    wife becomes haraam for him, but this is da’eef (weak); the correct view is 
    that which we have mentioned above. 

    Their evidence is that marriage in sharee’ah applies only to 
    the woman with whom the marriage contract is done, not just to intercourse. 
    Moreover, there is no dowry, ‘iddah or inheritance in the case of zina. Ibn 
    ‘Abd al-Barr said: The scholars of different regions who issue fatwas are 
    unanimously agreed that it is not haraam for the zaani to marry the woman 
    with whom he committed zina, so it is more permissible for him to marry her 
    mother or daughter. 

    2.

    Ibraaheem al-Nakha’i, al-Sha’bi, Abu Haneefah and his 
    companions, Ahmad and Ishaaq said, and it was also narrated from Maalik, 
    that if he commits zina with a woman, her mother and daughter become haraam 
    for him. 

    3.

    The view of the Hanafis – which is also the view of 
    al-Shaafa’i – is that touching with desire for a permissible reason comes 
    under the same ruling as intercourse, because it is intimacy. But if it is 
    done for a haraam reason, it has no effect, like zina. They said: His wife 
    become haraam for him if he merely touches her mother or looks at her 
    private part. 

    Ibraaheem al-Nakha’i said: They used to say: If a man looks 
    at a woman and at that which is not permissible for him, or touches her with 
    desire, then they both become haraam to him.  

    Al-Musannaf (3/303). 

    The most correct view is the view of the majority, that his 
    doing haraam actions with his wife’s mother, daughter or sister does not 
    make his wife haraam for him, whether he is married or after the marriage 
    has ended. Hence it is known that if a husband molests his wife’s daughter 
    and even it is proven that he raped her, this reprehensible act does not 
    mean that his wife becomes haraam for him. 

    Al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) narrated (5/1963) 
    that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: If a man commits 
    zina with his wife’s sister, his wife does not become haraam for him. 

    Al-Bayhaqi narrated – in a report classed as saheeh by 
    al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (7/168) – that Ibn ‘Abbaas said concerning a man who 
    committed zina with his wife’s mother: He has transgressed two sacred 
    limits, but the wife does not become haraam for him. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    Question: If a man commits zina with a woman, do his 
    ascendants and descendents become haraam for her, and do her ascendants and 
    descendents become haraam for him? 

    Answer: They do not become haraam, because that is not 
    included in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “Forbidden to you 
    (for marriage) are: … your wives’ mothers, your stepdaughters under your 
    guardianship, born of your wives to whom you have gone in — but there is no 
    sin on you if you have not gone in them (to marry their daughters), — the 
    wives of your sons” [al-Nisa’ 4:23]. The zaaniyah (woman who commits 
    zina) is not included in this, so if a person commits zina with a woman, we 
    do not say that this woman is one of his wives, and we do not say that this 
    woman with whom he committed zina is one of “your wives’ mothers” and thus 
    it remains permissible (to marry her), because she is included in the verse 
    (interpretation of the meaning): “All others are 
    lawful…” [al-Nisa’ 4:24].  

    Al-Sharh al-Mumti’ (5/179). 

    Thirdly: 

    You can ask for the marriage to be annulled by the sharee’ah 
    judge (qaadi) for two legitimate reasons, the first of which is his 
    evildoing and immorality by committing this revolting crime – if it is 
    proven; the second is his being away from the home. Both of these reasons 
    make it permissible for you to seek an annulment of the marriage from the 
    sharee’ah judge and to demand your rights in full. This is called al-talaaq 
    li’l-darar (divorce on the grounds of harm). Imam Maalik and Imam Ahmad (may 
    Allaah have mercy on them) said concerning it: The harm which justifies 
    seeking a separation of the couple includes everything that harms the wife 
    or involves mistreatment of her, physically, mentally or psychologically. 
    That varies from one woman to another, and according to circumstances and 
    customs. Examples of harm for which a wife may ask for divorce include 
    hitting her for no legitimate reason, forcing her to do something haraam or 
    not to do something obligatory, and evil deeds, immorality and misconduct on 
    his part.

    In the answer to question no.
    4060 we have explained that this 
    group, which is known as Ahmadiyyah or Qadianiyyah, the followers of Mirza 
    Ghulam Ahmad, are kaafirs. In that answer you will find a discussion of 
    their kaafir beliefs and what the scholars have said about them.

    Based on this, it is not permissible for a Muslim to marry 
    one of them or to give his daughter in marriage to them, because they are 
    kaafirs and apostates, and Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And do not marry Al-Mushrikaat (idolatresses) till they 
    believe (worship Allaah Alone). And indeed a slave woman who believes is 
    better than a (free) Mushrikah (idolatress), even though she pleases you. 
    And give not (your daughters) in marriage to Al‑Mushrikoon till they believe 
    (in Allaah Alone) and verily, a believing slave is better than a (free) 
    Mushrik (idolater), even though he pleases you. Those (Al-Mushrikoon) invite 
    you to the Fire, but Allaah invites (you) to Paradise and forgiveness by His 
    Leave, and makes His Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, 
    revelations, etc.) clear to mankind that they may remember”

    [al-Baqarah 2:221]

    al-Sa’di (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his Tafseer 
    (p. 99): 

    i.e., do not marry mushrik women so long as they still 
    believe in shirk, until they believe, for a believing woman, no matter how 
    ugly she is, is better than a mushrik woman, no matter how beautiful she is. 
    This is general in meaning and includes all mushrik women. The verse in 
    Soorat al-Maa'idah is more specific and permits marriage to women of the 
    people of the Book, as Allaah says: “(Lawful 
    to you in marriage) are chaste women from the believers and chaste women 
    from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before your 
    time” [al-Maa’idah 5:5]…  
Then Allaah mentions the 
    wisdom behind the prohibition on the marriage of a Muslim man or woman to 
    one whose beliefs differ from theirs, as He says: “Those (Al-Mushrikoon) 
    invite you to the Fire” i.e., by their words, actions and circumstances, 
    and the one who mixes with them faces danger from them. The danger is not in 
    any worldly sense; rather the danger is eternal doom. End quote. 
If this friend of yours 
    is in a haraam relationship, then you must explain to him that this 
    relationship is haraam and that it is not permissible for a Muslim to be 
    alone with a non-mahram woman, or to shake hands with her or correspond with 
    her, and that he cannot end this relationship by getting married because it 
    is haraam to marry apostate women. He should look for a wife who is 
    religiously committed and can help him to protect his religious commitment 
    and to obey his Lord, and whom he can trust with his children.

    marriage) with a good heart; but if they, of their own good pleasure, remit 
    any part of it to you, take it, and enjoy it without fear of any harm (as 
    Allaah has made it lawful).”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:4]

    al-Tabari (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    What is meant by that is: Give women their mahr as something 
    that is required and obligatory. 

    He also said: 

    It was narrated from Qataadah: “And give to the women 
    (whom you marry) their Mahr (obligatory bridal-money given by the husband to 
    his wife at the time of marriage) with a good heart” i.e., it is 
    obligatory. And it was narrated from Ibn Jurayj: “And give to the women 
    (whom you marry) their Mahr (obligatory bridal-money given by the husband to 
    his wife at the time of marriage) with a good heart”: he said: it is 
    obligatory and the amount is to be named. It was narrated from Ibn Zayd 
    concerning the verse “And give to the women (whom you marry) their Mahr 
    (obligatory bridal-money given by the husband to his wife at the time of 
    marriage) with a good heart”: the Arabic word nihlah (translated here as 
    “with a good heart”) means: obligatory. 

    Tafseer al-Tabari, 4/241 
Allaah has made the mahr 
    obligatory for the man, who must give it to the woman, and not vice versa. 
    This is what is indicated by the texts of the Qur’aan and also by the texts 
    of the Sunnah. For example, al-Bukhaari narrated from Sahl ibn Sa’d that a 
    woman came to the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) and said: O Messenger of Allaah, I offer myself to you (in 
    marriage). She stood there for a long time, then a man said: O Messenger of 
    Allaah, marry her to me if you have no need of her. He said: “Do you have 
    anything that you could give to her as a dowry?” He said: “I have nothing 
    but this izaar of mine.” He said: “Look for something, even if it is a ring 
    of iron.” So he looked but he could not find anything. The Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Do you know 
    anything of the Qur’aan?” He said: “Yes, Soorah such and such, and Soorah 
    such and such.” He said: “I give her to you in marriage in return for what 
    you know of the Qur’aan.” 

    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4741; Muslim, 1325. 

    Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    This indicates that the mahr is essential in marriage, 
    because he said: “Do you have anything that you could give to her as a 
    dowry?” The scholars are unanimously agreed that it is not permissible for 
    anyone to engage in intimacy (with a woman) without naming the mahr. 

    It also indicates that it is better to name the mahr. If a 
    marriage contract is done without naming the mahr, the marriage is valid and 
    the bride is entitled to a mahr like that of other women like her, when the 
    marriage is consummated. End quote. 

    Fath al-Baari, 9/211. 
The Qur’aan, the Sunnah 
    and the consensus of the scholars indicate that the dowry is to be given by 
    the man to the woman, not vice versa. This is what is in accordance with 
    sound human nature. How can a man be qawwaam (in charge of) the woman when 
    she is the one who has paid the mahr to him? Allaah has made spending of 
    wealth by the husband one of the reasons why men are in charge of women, as 
    He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Men are the protectors and 
    maintainers of women, because Allaah has made one of them to excel the 
    other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:34]

    After this spending from the husband, the wife often realizes 
    the burden that her husband bears, so she reduces the mahr or part of it 
    willingly. There is no sin of the husband if he then takes it, because 
    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And give to the women (whom you marry) their Mahr 
    (obligatory bridal-money given by the husband to his wife at the time of 
    marriage) with a good heart; but if they, of their own good pleasure, remit 
    any part of it to you, take it, and enjoy it without fear of any harm (as 
    Allaah has made it lawful).”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:4]

    This money that the woman gives to the man as a dowry to him 
    for marrying her is contrary to Islam, to the fitrah, to reason and to human 
    nature. This applies even if it is a little, so how about the amounts that 
    you mention?! 

    As for the solution, it is essential that the scholars, 
    daa’iyahs and media in your country strive their utmost to put an end to 
    this problem and then deal with it and change the custom to that which is in 
    accordance with sharee’ah, which is in accordance with the nature which 
    Allaah has created in man.

    fitrah – circumcision, shaving the pubes, plucking the armpit hairs, cutting 
    the nails, and trimming the moustache."" narrated by al-Bukhaari (5889) and 
    Muslim (257). 

    Undoubtedly with regard to the Sunnahs of the fitrah, some of 
    the wisdom behind them is obvious, and that includes circumcision. There are 
    clear benefits to it which we should pay attention to and understand the 
    wisdom behind it. 

    In the answer to question no. 
    9412 we have discussed 
    circumcision, how it is to be done and the ruling on it. In the answer to 
    question no. 7073 we have explained the health and shar’i benefits of 
    circumcision for males. 

    Circumcision is prescribed for both males and females. The 
    correct view is that circumcision is obligatory for males and that it is one 
    of the symbols of Islam, and that circumcision of women is mustahabb but not 
    obligatory. 

    There are reports in the Sunnah which indicate that 
    circumcision for women is prescribed in Islam. In Madeenah there was a woman 
    who circumcised women and the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said to her: “Do not go to the extreme in cutting; that is better 
    for the woman and more liked by the husband.”  Narrated by Abu Dawood 
    (5271), classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
Female circumcision has 
    not been prescribed for no reason, rather there is wisdom behind it and it 
    brings many benefits. 

    Mentioning some of these benefits, Dr. Haamid al-Ghawaabi 
    says: 

    The secretions of the labia minora accumulate in 
    uncircumcised women and turn rancid, so they develop an unpleasant odour 
    which may lead to infections of the vagina or urethra. I have seen many 
    cases of sickness caused by the lack of circumcision. 

    Circumcision reduces excessive sensitivity of the clitoris 
    which may cause it to increase in size to 3 centimeters when aroused, which 
    is very annoying to the husband, especially at the time of intercourse. 

    Another benefit of circumcision is that it prevents 
    stimulation of the clitoris which makes it grow large in such a manner that 
    it causes pain. 

    Circumcision prevents spasms of the clitoris which are a kind 
    of inflammation.  

    Circumcision reduces excessive sexual desire. 

    Then Dr al-Ghawaabi refutes those who claim that female 
    circumcision leads to frigidity by noting: 

    Frigidity has many causes, and this claim is not based on any 
    sound statistics comparing circumcised women with uncircumcised women, 
    except in the case of Pharaonic circumcision which is where the clitoris is 
    excised completely. This does in fact lead to frigidity but it is contrary 
    to the kind of circumcision enjoined by the Prophet of mercy  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) when he said: “Do not destroy” i.e., do not 
    uproot or excise. This alone is evidence that speaks for itself, because 
    medicine at that time knew very little about this sensitive organ (the 
    clitoris) and its nerves. 

    From Liwa’ al-Islam magazine, issue 8 and 10; article 
    entitled Khitaan al-Banaat (circumcision of girls). 

    The female gynaecologist Sitt al-Banaat Khaalid says in an 
    article entitled Khitaan al-Banaat Ru’yah Sihhiyyah (Female 
    circumcision from a health point of view): 

    For us in the Muslim world female circumcision is, above all 
    else, obedience to Islam, which means acting in accordance with the fitrah 
    and following the Sunnah which encourages it. We all know the dimensions of 
    Islam, and that everything in it must be good in all aspects, including 
    health aspects. If the benefits are not apparent now, they will become known 
    in the future, as has happened with regard to male circumcision – the world 
    now knows its benefits and it has become widespread among all nations 
    despite the opposition of some groups. 

    Then she mentioned some of the health benefits of female 
    circumcision and said: 

    It takes away excessive libido from women

    It prevents unpleasant odours which result from foul 
    secretions beneath the prepuce.

    It reduces the incidence of urinary tract infections

    It reduces the incidence of infections of the reproductive 
    system. 

    In the book on Traditions that affect the health of women and 
    children, which was published by the World Health Organization in 1979 it 
    says: 

    With regard to the type of female circumcision which involves 
    removal of the prepuce of the clitoris, which is similar to male 
    circumcision, no harmful health effects have been noted.

45529,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45529,Why Did Allah Create Us?,Why Did Allah Create Us?,"One of the greatest reasons for which Allah has created us – which is one of the greatest tests – is the command to affirm His Oneness (Tawhid) and to worship Him Alone with no partner or associate. For more, see the detailed answer.","Allah never created anything in vain


Man was not created to eat, drink and multiply alone


Allah created us to be tested 


Allah created us to worship Him alone","Praise be to Allah.Allah never created anything in vain
One of the greatest attributes of Allah is wisdom, and one of His greatest names is al-Hakim (the most Wise). It should be noted that He has not created anything in vain; exalted be Allah far above such a thing. Rather He creates things for great and wise reasons, and for sublime purposes. Those who know them know them and those who do not know them do not know them. Allah has stated that in His Noble Book, where He says that He has not created mankind in vain, and He has not created the heavens and the earth in vain . Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Did you think that We had created you in play (without any purpose), and that you would not be brought back to Us?” So Exalted be Allah, the True King: La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the Lord of the Supreme Throne!” [al-Muminun 23:115, 116] 
“We created not the heavens and the earth and all that is between them for a (mere) play” [al-Anbiya 21:16] 
“And We created not the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them, for mere play. We created them not except with truth (i.e. to examine and test those who are obedient and those who are disobedient and then reward the obedient ones and punish the disobedient ones), but most of them know not” [al-Dukhan 44:38] 
“HaMim. [These letters are one of the miracles of the Quran, and none but Allah (Alone) knows their meanings.] The revelation of the Book (this Quran) is from Allah, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise. We created not the heavens and the earth and all that is between them except with truth, and for an appointed term. But those who disbelieve, turn away from that whereof they are warned” [al-Ahqaf 46:1-3] 
Just as it is proven that there is wisdom behind the creation of man from the standpoint of shari’ah (Islamic law), it is also proven from the standpoint of reason. The wise man cannot but accept that things have been created for a reason, and the wise man regards himself as being above doing things in his own life for no reason, so how about Allah, the Wisest of the wise? 
Hence the wise believers affirm that there is wisdom in Allah’s creation , and the disbelievers deny that. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alternation of night and day, there are indeed signs for men of understanding. Those who remember Allah (always, and in prayers) standing, sitting, and lying down on their sides, and think deeply about the creation of the heavens and the earth, (saying): Our Lord! You have not created (all) this without purpose, glory to You! (Exalted are You above all that they associate with You as partners). Give us salvation from the torment of the Fire”
[Al ‘Imran 3:190, 191] 
And Allah says, describing the attitude of the disbelievers towards the wisdom of His creation (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And We created not the heaven and the earth and all that is between them without purpose! That is the consideration of those who disbelieve! Then woe to those who disbelieve (in Islamic Monotheism) from the Fire!” [Sad 38:27] 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahman al-Sa’di (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Allah tells us of His perfect wisdom in creating the heavens and the earth, and that He has not created them in vain, i.e., in play with no beneficial purpose. 
“That is the consideration of those who disbelieve” in their Lord, because they think that which does not befit His Majesty. 
“Then woe to those who disbelieve (in Islamic Monotheism) from the Fire!” Allah created the heavens and earth in truth for truth. He created them so that His slaves might understand the completeness of His Knowledge and Power and the extent of His Might, and that He Alone is the One to be worshipped, and not those who have not created even an atom in the heavens or on earth. And that they might know that the Resurrection is true and that Allah will judge between the people of good and evil. The one who is ignorant of the wisdom of Allah should not think that Allah will treat them equally when judging them. Hence Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Shall We treat those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah Islamic Monotheism) and do righteous good deeds as Mufsidun (those who associate partners in worship with Allah and commit crimes) on earth? Or shall We treat the Muttaqun (the pious) as the Fujjar (criminals, disbelievers, the wicked)?” [Sad 38:28] 
This does not befit Our wisdom and Our judgement.” (Tafsir al-Sa’di, p. 712)
Man was not created to eat, drink and multiply alone
Allah has not created man to eat, drink and multiply, in which case he would be like the animals. Allah has honoured man and favoured him far above many of those whom He has created, but many people insist on disbelief, so they are ignorant of or deny the true wisdom behind their creation, and all they care about is enjoying the pleasures of this world. The life of such people is like that of animals, and indeed they are even more astray. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“while those who disbelieve enjoy themselves and eat as cattle eat; and the Fire will be their abode” [Muhammad 47:12]
 “Leave them to eat and enjoy, and let them be preoccupied with (false) hope. They will come to know!” [al-Hijr 15:3]
“And surely, We have created many of the jinn and mankind for Hell. They have hearts wherewith they understand not, and they have eyes wherewith they see not, and they have ears wherewith they hear not (the truth). They are like cattle, nay even more astray; those! They are the heedless ones'' [al-A'raf 7:179] 
It is well known to wise people that the one who does a thing knows more about the wisdom behind it than anyone else and for Allah is the highest description (cf. al-Nahl 16:60); He is the One Who has created mankind and He knows best the wisdom behind the creation of mankind. No one would dispute this with regard to worldly matters. All people are certain that their physical faculties have been created for a reason. The eye is for seeing, the ear is for hearing, and so on. Does it make sense for his physical faculties to have been created for a reason but for himself to have been created in vain? Or does he not agree to respond to the One Who created him when He tells him of the reason behind his creation?
Allah created us to be tested 
Allah has told us that the creation of the heavens and the earth, and of life and death, is for the purpose of testing, so as to test man. Whoever obeys Him, He will reward him, and whoever disobeys Him, He will punish him. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And He it is Who has created the heavens and the earth in six Days and His Throne was on the water, that He might try you, which of you is the best in deeds. But if you were to say to them: “You shall indeed be raised up after death,” those who disbelieve would be sure to say, “This is nothing but obvious magic” [Hud 11:7] 
“Who has created death and life that He may test you which of you is best in deed. And He is the All-Mighty, the Oft-Forgiving” [al-Mulk 67:2] 
From this test results a manifestation of the names and attributes of Allah, such as Allah’s names al-Rahman (the Most Gracious), al-Ghafur (the Oft Forgiving), al-Hakim (the Most Wise), al-Tawwab (the Acceptor of Repentance), al-Rahim (the Most Merciful), and other names of Allah. 
Allah created us to worship Him alone
One of the greatest reasons for which Allah has created mankind – which is one of the greatest tests – is the command to affirm His Oneness (Tawhid ) and to worship Him Alone with no partner or associate. Allah has stated this reason for the creation of mankind, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And I (Allah) created not the jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone)” [al-Dhariyat 51:56] 
Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“I.e., I have created them so that I may command them to worship Me, not because I have any need of them. ‘Ali ibn Abi Talhah said, narrating from Ibn ‘Abbas: “except that they should worship Me (alone)” willingly or unwillingly. This is the view favoured by Ibn Jarir. Ibn Jurayj said: i.e., except that they should know Me. Al-Rabi’ ibn Anas said: “Except that they should worship Me”, i.e., for the purpose of worship.” (Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 4/239)
Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahman al-Sa’di (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Allah, may He be exalted, created mankind to worship Him and to know Him by His names and attributes, and to enjoin that upon them. Whoever submits to Him and does what is enjoined upon him will be one of those who are successful, but whoever turns away from that, they are the losers. He will inevitably gather them together in the Hereafter where He will reward or punish them for what He commanded and forbade them to do. Hence Allah mentions how the mushrikin (polytheists) denied the reward or punishment, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“But if you were to say to them: ‘You shall indeed be raised up after death,’ those who disbelieve would be sure to say, ‘This is nothing but obvious magic’” [Hud 11:7] 
i.e., if you were to speak to these people and tell them about the Resurrection after death , they would not believe you, rather they would reject your words vehemently and deny the message you brought, and they would say, ‘This is nothing but obvious magic,’ but in fact it is obvious truth.” (Tafsir al-Sa’di, p. 333)

    We asked Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Jibreen

    The pilgrims who are camped in Muzdalifah in the camp that 
    contains the overflow from Mina come under the same ruling as those who are 
    in Mina. If they want to hasten on, they should leave their places before 
    Maghrib. It is permissible for them to leave if they have prepared to leave 
    before Maghrib and are delayed by the crowds, as is the case with the people 
    of Mina if they prepare to leave and resolve to do so but are delayed by the 
    crowds. 

    As for those who stayed in various parts of Mina, such as 
    some areas of Makkah, because they cannot find any room in Mina, it is 
    sufficient for them to have the intention of hastening on, but they should 
    have stoned the Jamaraat and left the boundaries of Mina before Maghrib. If 
    they are delayed by the crowds, they may still hasten on as stated above.

    Firstly: 

    We ask Allaah to relieve your distress and make things easy 
    for you, and to help you to obey Him and worship Him properly. Remember that 
    the alienation that you are feeling is a good sign for you, The Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Islam began as something 
    strange and will revert to being something strange, so glad tidings to the 
    strangers.” Narrated by Muslim (145). 

    The word tooba (translated here as “glad tidings”) has many 
    meanings, such as goodness and honour, a great tree in Paradise, joy and 
    happiness, and many other meanings, all of which may apply here. 

    Al-Sindi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    “Strange” means because its followers are small in numbers. 
    The basic meaning of ghareeb (stranger) is one who is far from his home. 

    “And will revert to being something strange” means that few 
    will adhere to it and help others to do so, even if the Muslims are many.  

    “to the strangers” means those who follow its commands. 

    “Tooba” is derived from the word tayyib (good), and it is 
    interpreted as referring to Paradise or to a great tree that grows there. 

    This indicates that supporting Islam and obeying its commands 
    may require the one who does that to leave his homeland and be patient in 
    bearing the hardships of being away from his homeland, as was the case when 
    it first began. 

    Sharh Sunan Ibn Majaah (hadeeth 
    no 3986. 

    Secondly: 

    You have the best example in the Messenger of Allaah  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). He brought light to his people, 
    but they insisted on remaining in the darkness of kufr and ignorance. They 
    accused him of being a sorcerer, soothsayer or madman, but he was patient in 
    calling them, and he did not get fed up of repeating his call, using 
    different methods of calling individuals and groups, calling in secret and 
    in the open, until he attained great success. Similarly, daa’iyahs who came 
    after him called the kuffaar to Islam, and called sinners to obedience, and 
    called innovators to the Sunnah. Many of them experienced hardship, distress 
    and difficulties, but that did not stop them from persisting in da’wah. Were 
    it not for that, Islam would not have reached your country, the Maldives! 

    Think about these examples, and do what they did, and be 
    patient as they were patient, so that you may attain the pleasure of Allaah. 
    What you hear of mockery and being called “Wahhabis” was said by those who 
    came before them, and the fools still repeat it with regard to those who 
    promote the Sunnah, but that does not harm them or make them stop conveying 
    the religion of Allaah. 

    Thirdly: 

    In addition to being patient in calling people, we advise you 
    to select wise people among other women and your relatives to convey the 
    religion of Allaah to them and remind them of the truths of Islam, for if 
    people are happy to belong to Islam, that does not prevent them from 
    following the Sunnah, but there may be other obstacles that are preventing 
    them from coming to the path of truth, such as misguided scholars and 
    proponents of bid’ah, or specious arguments and whims and desires, and so 
    on. It may also be due to the fact that we are failing to convey the truth 
    of Islam to them, or we do not have wise ways of conveying it. 

    You have to be gentle and patient, and select the wisest 
    people, and address them politely. Use different means such as audio tapes, 
    video lectures and books, and you may see some good results. 

    Fourthly:  

    Strive to make your house the focal point of this da’wah. 
    Start with your husband and children, so that this will become a house of 
    blessing for all people. Remember that our mother Khadeejah bint Khuwaylid 
    was the first one of this ummah to become Muslim, and she was the first one 
    to support the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in 
    conveying the message and calling her daughters to Islam. Her house was the 
    first house to become Muslim, and from it the call of goodness spread to all 
    corners of the earth, so be like her and follow her example. 

    In the answer to question no.
    9380 you will find more advice and 
    suggestions, which we hope you will read. There is no need to repeat them 
    here.

They said: that is because the basic principle is washing the feet, so that is better. 
See al-Majmoo’, 1/502 
Imam Ahmad was of the view that wiping over the socks is better. He gave the following evidence for that: 
1 – It is easier, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was never given the choice between two things but he chose the easier of the two, so long as it was not a sin; if it was a sin he would be the furthest removed of the people from it. Narrated by al-Bukhaari (3560) and Muslim (2327). 
2 – It is a concession, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah loves concessions to be taken as He hates sin to be committed.” Narrated by Ahmad, 5832; classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel, 564. 
3 – Wiping over the socks involves being different from the people of bid’ah who reject it, such as the Khaarijis and Raafidis. 
There are many ahaadeeth from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) which indicate that he did both: he washed his feet and he wiped over his khuffayn (leather slippers). This led some scholars to say that wiping and washing are the same. This was the view favoured by Ibn al-Mundhir (may Allah have mercy on him). 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and his student Ibn al-Qayyim were of the view that either may be better depending on the circumstances of his feet. If a person is wearing socks it is better to wipe over them, and if his feet are bare, it is better to wash them, and he should not put socks on in order to wipe over them. 
This is indicated by the hadeeth of al-Mugheerah ibn Shu’bah (may Allah have mercy on him) who wanted to take off the Prophet’s khuffayn in order to wash his feet. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him: “Leave them, for I put them on pure,” so he wiped over them.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 206; Muslim, 274. This indicates that wiping is better for one who is wearing socks. 
This is also indicated by the report narrated by al-Tirmidhi (96) from Safwaan ibn ‘Assaal (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to tell us when we were travelling not to take off our kufoof for three days and nights, except in the case of janaabah, but if one defecated, urinated or slept (there was no need to take them off). Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel, 104. The command to wipe indicates that it is better, but that applies to one who is wearing socks. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: 
Conclusion: what is better for each one is that which is suited to his circumstances. For the one whose feet are bare, it is better for him to wash them, and he should not put on socks so that he can wipe over them, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to wash his feet when they were bare, and he would wipe over them if he was wearing khufoof. End quote from al-Insaaf, 1/378 
Ibn al-Qayyim said in Zaad al-Ma’aad (1/199): 
He is not required to do more than is required with regard to the situation of his feet. If he is wearing khufoof, he should wipe over them and not take them off, and if his feet are bare he should wash them, and he should not put on socks so that he can wipe over them.

If a person travels from one Muslim country to another, and the breaking of the fast comes later in the country to which he has traveled, then he should continue to fast with them until they break the fast, because the fast is the day on which the people fast, and the breaking of the fast is the day on which the people break the fast, and the sacrifice (al-adha) is the day on which the people offer the sacrifice. He should do this even if he fasts an extra day or more. This is similar to the case if he travels to a country where the sunset comes later; he should continue to fast until it sets, even if that adds two hours to his day, or three, or more. This also applies if he travels to another country where the new moon has not been sighted, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded us not to fast or to break the fast until we see it. He said: “Fast when you see it, and break your fast when you see it.”
With regard to the opposite case, which is when a person travels from a land where the onset of the month comes later to a land where the onset of the month comes earlier, then he should break the fast with them, and make up any days he has missed of Ramadan later on. If he misses one day, he must make up one day, if he misses two days he must make up two days. If he breaks the fast after twenty-eight days, then he must make up two days if the month was the full thirty days in both countries, and he must make up one day if it was only twenty-nine days in both countries or in one of them. 
Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 19/ question no. 24. 
He was also asked: 
People may say: Why do you say that he has to fast more than thirty days in the first case and make up missed days in the second? 
He replied: 
He has to make up missed fasts in the second case because the month cannot be less than twenty-nine days, and he should fast more than thirty days because the new moon has not been sighted. In the first case we say to him: Break the fast even if you have not completed twenty-nine days, because the new moon has been sighted, and when the new moon has been sighted it is essential to break the fast, and you cannot fast on the first day of Shawwaal.  If you have fasted less then twenty-nine days, you have to complete twenty-nine days. This is unlike the second case, where it is still Ramadan for you when you come to a country where the new moon has not yet been sighted. It is still Ramadan for you, so how can you break the fast? You have to continue fasting. If the month becomes longer for you, then it is like extra hours in the day.

45556,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45556,If a person does not realize that he had a wet dream until the end of the day – what should he do?,"I had a wet dream one night, and when I got up to pray Fajr I did not remember that, because I did not notice any wetness as it had dried. I prayed all the obligatory prayers that day in a state of janaabah. In the evening I remembered that I had had an erotic dream, after I noticed the traces of wetness on my underwear. At that point I went and did ghusl and repeated all the prayers of that day. Was what I did correct?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Yes, what you did was correct and in accordance with 
    sharee’ah. Purity is a condition of prayer being valid, and janaabah 
    necessitates ghusl. The prayers that you offered whilst junub are excused 
    because you did not do that deliberately, but you did not discharge your 
    duty after you realized what your situation was until you did ghusl and 
    repeated the prayers. This is what you did and this is correct. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked 
    about someone who noticed semen on his clothes after he had prayed Fajr, and 
    he had not noticed it before. What is the ruing on that? 

    He replied: 

    If he did not go back to sleep after praying Fajr then his 
    Fajr prayer is not valid because he did it when he was junub, as he can be 
    certain that it happened before he prayed. 

    But if he went back to sleep after praying Fajr, then he does 
    not know whether this happened during his sleep after the prayer or during 
    his sleep before the prayer, so the basic principle is to assume that it 
    happened after the prayer and that the prayer is valid. The same ruling 
    applies if a person notices traces of semen and is not sure whether that is 
    from the previous night or the night before that, so he should assume that 
    it is from the previous night and that it happened in the last period of 
    sleep, because that is more certain, whereas there is some doubt concerning 
    what came before that, and if there is doubt concerning something that 
    invalidates one’s state of purity there is no obligation to purify oneself 
    from it. The Prophet (S) said: “If one of you feels something in his stomach 
    and is not sure whether something (i.e., wind) came out of him or not, then 
    he should not leave the mosque.” Narrated by Muslim from the hadeeth of Abu 
    Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him). And Allaah is the Source of 
    strength. 

    Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 
    11/question no. 165. 

    The Shaykh was also asked: 
A person prayed Maghrib 
    and ‘Isha’, then he went home. When he took off his clothes he noticed 
    traces of semen on his underwear. What should he do? 

    He replied: 

    If this man who found semen on his clothes did not do ghusl, 
    then he has to do ghusl and repeat the prayers that he offered when he was 
    junub. But sometimes a man may see traces of janaabah on his clothes and not 
    know whether that happened the previous night – should he regard that as 
    having happened the night before or on a previous night? 

    The answer is that he should regard it as having happened on 
    the night before, because there is some doubt concerning the previous night, 
    so the basic principle is that he was in a state of purity (on the previous 
    night). Similarly if he went to sleep after praying Fajr then woke up and 
    noticed traces of janaabah on his clothes, and he does not know whether that 
    was from his sleep after Fajr or his sleep during the night, should he 
    repeat Fajr prayer? 

    The answer is that he does not have to repeat Fajr prayer, 
    because there is no certainty that he had a wet dream whilst he slept during 
    the night. So you should make this the rule you follow: every time you are 
    uncertain as to whether this janaabah happened during a previous sleep or a 
    later sleep, assume that it was during the later sleep.

That concerning which Shari`ah says nothing is forgivable (and is a matter of personal choice), because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “What is permitted is that which Allah has permitted in His Book, and what is forbidden is that which Allah has forbidden in His Book, and what He has remained silent about is forgivable.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 1726; classed as good by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi”

45559,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45559,The Divine names as remedy,"Is it permissible to use the Beautiful Names of Allaah as a remedy, such as saying “Ya Baseer (O All-Seeing)” over the patient’s eye and so on?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Using the names of Allaah as a remedy is a practice that is widespread among people. Flyers are widely distributed on which the names are written and beside them the diseases which may supposedly be treated by that name. 
The one who claims to have discovered this kind of remedy is Dr Ibraaheem Kareem, the inventor of the science of “biogeometry”. He claimed that the beautiful names of Allaah have the power to heal a huge number of diseases, based on his research in which he measured energy levels in the human body. He claimed to have discovered that each of the names of Allaah produces an energy that prompts the immune system to work efficiently in a particular part of the human body. He claimed that by applying the “law of resonance” he could, simply by mentioning one of the names of Allaah, bring about improvements in the vital energy in the human body. After researching for three years, he presented his discovery to people in a schedule in which he described diseases and stated which name of Allaah could be beneficial in treating it. 
For example: al-Samee’ (the All Hearing) can restore the balance of energy; al-Razzaaq (the Provider) can treat the stomach; al-Jabbaar (the Compeller) can treat the spine; al-Ra’oof (the Most Kind) can treat the colon; al-Naafi’ (the Bringer of benefits) can treat the bones; al-Hayy (the Ever-Living) can treat the kidneys; al-Badee’ (the Originator) can treat the hair; Jalla Jalaalahu (Glorified be His Majesty) can treat dandruff; al-Noor (the Light), al-Baseer (the All-Seeing) and al-Wahhaab (the Bestower) can treat the eyes. … 
The way in which the remedy is administered is to repeat the name or a number of names over the affected part of the body, for ten minutes. 
He claims to have discovered that healing energy is multiplied when reciting the verses of healing after reciting tasbeeh of the beautiful names of Allaah. These verses are (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and heal the hearts of a believing people”
[al-Tawbah 9:14] 
“and a healing for that which is in your hearts”
[Yoonus 10:57] 
“wherein is healing for men”
[al-Nahl 16:69] 
“And We send down of the Qur’aan that which is a healing and a mercy”
[al-Isra’ 17:82] 
“And when I am ill, it is He Who cures me”
[al-Shu’ara’ 26:80] 
“Say: It is for those who believe, a guide and a healing”
[Fussilat 41:44]
Our response to these claims is: 
1 – Remedies may be administered either by scientific means or by religious means (as described in the Qur’aan and Sunnah). With regard to scientific, physical means, treatment should be based on experience and expertise. With regard to religious means, reference is to be made to the texts of sharee’ah in order to find out what remedies are to be used and how they are to be administered. Mentioning Allaah by His beautiful names (dhikr) is something that is prescribed in sharee’ah, but this researcher does not quote any shar’i source of evidence for using specific names of Allaah in this manner to treat disease, so it cannot be a legitimate shar’i means of treating disease. Religious matters cannot be subjected to experimentation or disrespected in this manner. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: 
Note that medical treatment is a means of healing but the One Who causes it to be effective is Allaah, may He be exalted. There is no cause except that which Allaah makes a cause. The things that Allaah makes causes are of two types: 
(i)Means that are prescribed in sharee’ah, such as the Holy Qur’aan and du’aa’ (supplication), as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said concerning Soorat al-Faatihah: “How did you know that it is a ruqyah (prayer or incantation for healing)?” And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) recited ruqyah for the sick by making du’aa’ for them, and Allaah healed those whom He wanted to heal by virtue of his du’aa’.
(ii)Physical means, such as medicines that are known from sharee’ah, like honey, or from experimentation and experience, like many kinds of medicine. The effect of this kind of means must be direct, not by way of imagination and wishful thinking. If its effect is known in a direct and measurable manner, then it may rightfully be used as a remedy by means of which a cure may be effected, by Allaah’s leave. But if it is simply the matter of wishful thinking on the part of the patient, which brings him some kind of psychological relief, then it is not permissible to rely on it or affirm that it is a remedy, lest a person come to depend on wishful thinking. Hence it is forbidden to wear rings, strings etc to heal disease or ward it off, because that is not a means that is prescribed in sharee’ah or known from experience. So long as it is not proven to be a means that is prescribed in sharee’ah or known from experience, it is not permissible to regard it as a means of healing. Regarding it as a means is a kind of trying to compete with Allaah in His dominion and associating others with Him, in the sense that one is trying to play a role that belongs only to Allaah, namely deciding the means and the ends. Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab explained this matter in Kitaab al-Tawheed by saying: “CHAPTER: It is shirk to wear rings and strings etc to ward off evil or relieve it.”
Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 1, question no. 49. 
2 – This involves mentioning names of Allaah and claiming that He has called Himself by these names, when that is not the case, such as Jalla Jalaaluhu (Glorified be His Majesty), al-Rasheed (the Guide), al-Badee’ (the Originator), al-Naafi’ (the Bringer of Benefit), etc. This is indicative of the ignorance of the one who made this claim, and that this so-called energy does not exist, because it is derived – according to his own claims – from names that are not names of Allaah as proven in the saheeh evidence. 
3 – He describes a specific method of treatment and stipulates a name for each disease. 
Even when a name mentioned is proven in saheeh evidence to be one of the names of Allaah, this still comes under the heading of speaking about Allaah without knowledge. Allaah has forbidden us to speak of Him without knowledge, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say (O Muhammad): (But) the things that my Lord has indeed forbidden are Al-Fawaahish (great evil sins and every kind of unlawful sexual intercourse) whether committed openly or secretly, sins (of all kinds), unrighteous oppression, joining partners (in worship) with Allaah for which He has given no authority, and saying things about Allaah of which you have no knowledge”
[al-A’raaf 7:33]
Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Sa’di (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on this verse: 
“and saying things about Allaah of which you have no knowledge” means, with regard to His names, attributes, actions and laws. 
Tafseer al-Sa’di, p. 250. 
4 – The scholars of the Standing Committee refuted the claims of this man when they were asked about this matter. They said: 
After studying the matter, the Standing Committee for Academic Research and Issuing Fatwas replied as follows: 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allaah, so call on Him by them, and leave the company of those who belie or deny (or utter impious speech against) His Names. They will be requited for what they used to do”
[al-A’raaf 7:180]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah has ninety-nine names; whoever learns them will enter Paradise.” Among them is the greatest name of Allaah which, if He is called upon by it, He will respond, and if He is asked by it, He will give. 
No one knows how many names Allaah has except Allaah Himself, and all of them are beautiful. We must believe in them and in the perfection, majesty and might of Allaah to which they point. It is haraam to disbelieve in them by rejecting all of them or any of them, or to deny the perfection of Allaah or any of the attributes of Allaah indicated by these names.  
An example of denying the names of Allaah is the claim made by this “Kareem Sayyid” and his student and son in a flyer which they distributed among people, that the beautiful names of Allaah have the power to heal a huge number of diseases, based on his research in which he measured energy levels in the human body. He claimed to have discovered that each of the names of Allaah produces an energy that prompts the immune system to work efficiently in a particular part of the human body. He claimed that by applying the “law of resonance” he could, simply by mentioning one of the names of Allaah, bring about improvements in the vital energy in the human body. He said: it is well known that the Pharaohs were the first ones to study and measure the life force in the human body by means of the Pharaonic pendulum. Then he mentioned a number of the names of Allaah in a schedule and claimed that each of these names could benefit the body in some way or treat specific physical diseases. He explained that by drawing a diagram of the human body and writing one of the names of Allaah on each part thereof. 
This action is false because it is a kind of disbelief concerning the names of Allaah and it subjects them to degrading treatment. What is prescribed in Islam with regard to the names of Allaah is to call upon Him by them, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“… so call on Him by them …”
[al-A’raaf 7:180]
Similarly we must affirm the attributes of Allaah implied by these names, because each of these names describes an attribute of Allaah and it is not permissible to use them for any other purpose than to call Him by them, unless there is shar’i evidence to that effect.
Whoever claims that they may be used in such and such a manner, or may be used to treat such and such a disease with no evidence to that effect from sharee’ah, is speaking about Allaah without knowledge, and Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say (O Muhammad): (But) the things that my Lord has indeed forbidden are Al-Fawaahish (great evil sins and every kind of unlawful sexual intercourse) whether committed openly or secretly, sins (of all kinds), unrighteous oppression, joining partners (in worship) with Allaah for which He has given no authority, and saying things about Allaah of which you have no knowledge”
[al-A’raaf 7:33]
This flyer must be destroyed, and the people mentioned here and others have to repent to Allaah from this action and not do any such thing again that has to do with ‘aqeedah and rulings of sharee’ah.

He said perhaps that (hating the Sahaabah) may put a person beyond the pale of faith but he would still remain a Muslim. We hope that you can explain this matter to us.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Undoubtedly it is a sign of great misfortune and misguidance if a person’s faith is based on slandering the companions of the best of mankind (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or arguing about the disputes that arose among them, instead of occupying himself with doing that which will benefit him in both his worldly and spiritual affairs. 
No one should have any reason to slander or hate or bear grudges against the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Their virtues are many, for they are the ones who supported Islam and spread the faith; they are the ones who fought the mushrikeen; they are the ones who transmitted the Qur’aan, Sunnah and rulings. They sacrificed themselves, their blood and their wealth for the sake of Allah. Allah chose them to be the companions of His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), so no one slanders them or hates them except a hypocrite whose does not love Islam or believe in it. 
It was narrated that al-Bara’ (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “The Ansaar: no one loves them but a believer and no one hates them but a hypocrite. Whoever loves them, Allah will love him, and whoever hates them, Allah will hate him.”
Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3672; Muslim, 75.  
If a man who hates the Ansaar cannot be a believer and that makes him a hypocrite, then how about one who hates the Ansaar and Muhaajireen and those who followed them in truth, and slanders them, curses them and denounces them and those who love them as kaafirs – as the Raafidis do? Undoubtedly they deserve more to be regarded as kaafirs and hypocrites, and of not being believers. 
Al-Tahhaawi said, discussing the beliefs of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah: 
We love the companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and we do not neglect to love any one of them, nor do we disavow any one of them. We hate those who hate them and who criticize them, and we only mention them in good terms. Loving them is part of religious commitment, faith and ihsaan, and hating them is kufr, hypocrisy and wrongdoing. 
Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan said: 
The way of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah is to love the family (ahl al-bayt) of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
The Naasibis love the Sahaabah but hate the family of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), hence they were called Naasibis because they set themselves up (nasb) as enemies of the family of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
The Raafidis are the opposite: they love the Prophet’s family (ahl al-bayt) – or so they claim, but they hate the Sahaabah, whom they curse, denounce as kaafirs and criticize. 
Whoever hates the Sahaabah hates Islam, because they are the bearers of Islam and the followers of the Chosen Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). So whoever hates them hates Islam, and this indicates that there is no faith in the hearts of such people and that they do not love Islam. 
This is an important basic principle which the Muslims should understand, namely loving and respecting the Sahaabah, because that is part of faith. Hating them or hating one of them is kufr and hypocrisy, because loving them is part of loving the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and hating them is part of hating the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
Sharh al-‘Aqeedah al-Waasitiyyah.
Some of the scholars explained in detail what is meant by hating the Sahaabah. They said: If a person hates some of them for some worldly reason, then that is not kufr and hypocrisy, but if it is for a religious reason, because they were the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), then undoubtedly this is hypocrisy. 
This is a good explanation which does not contradict what we have mentioned above, rather it explains it further and reinforces it. 
Abu Zar’ah al-Raazi said: If you see a man criticizing one of the companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), then know that he is a heretic. 
Imam Ahmad said: If you see a man mentioning one of the companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in a bad way, then call his Islam into question. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: 
If a person slanders them in a way that does not impugn their good character or religious commitment, such as describing one of them as being stingy or cowardly or lacking in knowledge or not being an ascetic and so on, then he deserves to be rebuked and disciplined, but we do not rule him to be a kaafir because of that. This is how the words of those who were not regarded as kaafirs by the scholars are to be understood.  
If a person curses them and slanders them in general terms, this is an area of scholarly dispute, depending on whether this cursing is motivated by mere feelings or religious doctrines. If a person goes beyond that and claims that they apostatized after the death of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), apart from a small group of no more than ten or so individuals, or that most of them rebelled and did evil, then there is no doubt that such a person is a kaafir, because he has denied what is stated in more than one place in the Qur’aan, that Allah was pleased with them and praised them. Indeed whoever doubts that such a person is a kaafir is himself a kaafir, because this implies that those who transmitted the Qur’aan and Sunnah were kaafirs or evildoers and that the best of this ummah which is described in the verse “You are the best of peoples ever raised up for mankind” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:110 – interpretation of the meaning] – the first generation – were mostly kaafirs and hypocrites. It implies that this ummah is the worst of nations, and that the first generations of this ummah are the most evil. No doubt this is blatant kufr, the evidence for which is quite clear. 
Hence you will find that most of those who proclaim such views will sooner or later be shown to be heretics. Heretics usually conceal their views, but Allah has punished some of them to make an example of them, and there are many reports that they were turned into pigs in life and in death. The scholars have compiled such reports, such as al-Haafiz al-Saalih Abu ‘Abd-Allah Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Waahid al-Maqdisi, in his book al-Nahi ‘an Sabb al-Ashaab in which he narrated the punishments that befell such heretics. 
In conclusion, there are some groups of those who slander the Sahaabah concerning who them is no doubt that they are kaafirs, others who cannot be judged to be kaafirs, and others concerning whom there is some doubt regarding that. 
Al-Saarim al-Maslool ‘ala Shaatim al-Rasool, p. 590-591. 
Taqiy al-Deen al-Subki said: 
… This refers to one who slanders some of the Sahaabah. But if a person slanders all of the Sahaabah, then he is undoubtedly a kaafir. The same applies if he slanders one of the Sahaabah just because he is a Sahaabi, because this is demeaning the virtue of the Sahaabah and indirectly slandering the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). So undoubtedly the person who does this is a kaafir. Based on this, the words of al-Tahhaawi, “and hating them is kufr” should be understood as meaning that hating all of the Sahaabah is undoubtedly kufr, but if a person slanders a Sahaabi not because he is a Sahaabi but for some personal reason, and that Sahaabi was, for example, one of those who became Muslim before the Conquest of Makkah and of whose virtue we are certain – such as the Raafidis who slander the two Shaykhs [Abu Bakr and ‘Umar] – then al-Qaadi Husayn stated that the one who slanders the two Shaykhs is a kaafir. 
The reason for the scholarly dispute on this issue is if a person slanders a specific person it may be for some personal reason, or he may hate someone for a worldly reason etc. This does not imply that he is a kaafir. But undoubtedly if he hates one of the two Shaykhs because he was a companion of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), then this is kufr, and indeed hating any of the Sahaabah who was lower in status than two Shaykhs just because he was a companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is also definitely kufr.

I asked a lady who is knowledgeable about Islam whether I should fast Ramadan and pray, and she answered: “Yes, fast and pray, because the soul had not yet been breathed into (the embryo), so it is regarded as Istihadah (non-menstrual vaginal bleeding).” So I fasted and prayed, but then another doctor told me that I should repeat the fasts. What is the correct ruling?","The correct scholarly view is that if a woman miscarries a foetus that was fully formed, then she should stop praying and fasting because this is postpartum bleeding. If the foetus was not fully formed, then her blood is irregular bleeding and she should not stop praying and fasting.",,"Praise be to Allah.The different opinions that our sister has heard are the result of scholarly differences on this matter. The correct scholarly view is that if a woman miscarries a foetus that was fully formed, then she should stop praying and fasting because this is postpartum bleeding.
If the foetus was not fully formed, then her blood is irregular bleeding and she should not stop praying and fasting . The minimum time in which the foetus becomes fully formed is eighty-one days (from conception). 
The scholars of the Standing Committee said: 
“If the foetus was fully formed, in the sense that its limbs (hands and feet) and head had appeared, it is prohibited to have intercourse with the woman so long as she is still bleeding, for up to forty days. It is permissible to have intercourse with her at times when the bleeding stops within forty days, after she does Ghusl. 
But if the limbs had not yet appeared in the embryo, then it is permissible to have intercourse with her even if that is immediately after the miscarriage, because that is not regarded as postpartum bleeding, rather it is irregular bleeding and she can pray and fast in that case .” (Fataawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 5/422, 423) 
Shaykh ‘Abd Al-‘Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
If a woman miscarries something in which human features such as a head, arm or leg etc., can be distinguished, then the rulings of postpartum bleeding apply and she should not pray or fast , and it is not permissible for her husband to have intercourse with her until she becomes pure or until forty days have passed. If she becomes pure before forty days have passed, then she has to do Ghusl and pray and fast in Ramadan, and it is permissible for her husband to have intercourse with her. 
But if no human features can be distinguished in what is passed by the woman, and it looks like flesh with no distinguishable features, or it is blood, then she comes under the ruling of one who is suffering from Istihadah (non-menstrual vaginal bleeding), not the rulings on postpartum bleeding or menstruation. So she has to pray and fast in Ramadan, and she is permissible for her husband… because this comes under the rulings on Istihadah according to the scholars.” (Fatawa Islamiyyah, 1/243)

The scholars said: If what is passed has clear human features, then her bleeding after that is regarded as postpartum bleeding, so she should stop praying and fasting , and her husband should avoid her until she becomes pure. If what comes out is unformed, then it is not regarded as the blood of postpaetum, rather it is irregular bleeding which does not prevent her from praying or fasting, etc. 
The scholars said: The earliest time at which distinguishable features may appear is eighty-one days.” (Fatawa Al-Mar’ah Al-Muslimah, 1/304, 305)

45567,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45567,A false saying: “Religion is the Opium of the people”,We often hear this saying: “Religion is the opium of the people.” What does it mean? Is it correct?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.This phrase was coined by the Jew Karl Marx. He said these words, claiming thereby that religion is the drug that numbs the minds of the people. 
His words are refuted by irrefutable facts, which is that the true religion, the faith of Ibraaheem which Allaah has enjoined upon His creation, is a religion that revives hearts and minds, and motivates people, pushing its followers to the forefront. It does not accept for its adherents to be humiliated and subjected to oppression, subjugated by their enemies, remaining silent in the face of falsehood and corruption, or adhering blindly to rituals and habits without any authority from Allaah. Rather it obliges them to be active and to prepare all their strength, and to subject all resources on the face of the earth, or beneath it or in its atmosphere, so as not to allow their enemies to beat them in this race. It requires them to devote all their talents and energies for the sake of Allaah, so that His Word may be supreme and suppress the word of those who fabricate lies about Allaah, and to disavow themselves of any who rejects His religion and denies the rule of His Law. 
This is the true religion, unlike what was said by this Jew and his followers and students, who were groomed to fight this true religion, the followers of which can never be defeated if they follow it as it was revealed. 
With regard to other so-called religions, such as atheism and idolatry, what this Jew said may be applied correctly to them, because their people are restricted by the myths in which they believe, which place obstacles in the path of scientific development and innovation.","Al-Ajwabah al-Mufeedah li Muhimmaat al-‘Aqeedah, p. 80  - By Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Doosari (may Allaah have mercy on him)"
45569,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45569,Very Close Predictions,"There is a woman who claims to worship Allah sincerely, and that whilst she is asleep she is visited by a man wearing a white gown who walks around her, then the next morning she predicts things that are almost true. The people know of her and they have started to visit her and they say that she has knowledge of the unseen, but no one knows the unseen except Allah. What is the ruling on this woman? What do you advise us to do?",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for anyone to claim to have knowledge of the unseen. The one who makes such a claim is a kafir (disbeliever). And it is not permissible to believe that anyone has knowledge of the unseen. The one who believes that is also a kafir. 
Allah has told us that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) does not have knowledge of the unseen, and that the jinn do not have knowledge of the unseen.
What we are referring to here is the unseen in absolute terms, which no one knows except Allah. As for the relative unseen – which some people know and others do not – some people may find a way to know this, so we have to find out how they know it; some may find out by spying and some may find out through the jinn. Both are ways which are forbidden for us to use.
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: 
Do the jinn have knowledge of the unseen?
He replied:
The jinn do not have knowledge of the unseen because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Say: None in the heavens and the earth knows the Ghaib (unseen) except Allah.”
[27:65]
“Then when We decreed death for him [Sulayman], nothing informed them (jinn) of his death except a little worm of the earth which kept (slowly) gnawing away at his stick. So when he fell down, the jinn saw clearly that if they had known the unseen, they would not have stayed in the humiliating torment” [34:14]
So whoever claims to have knowledge of the unseen is a kafir, and whoever believes the one who claims to have knowledge of the unseen is also a kafir, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Say: None in the heavens and the earth knows the Ghaib (unseen) except Allah.” [27:65]
No one knows what is unseen in the heavens and the earth except Allah alone. Those who claim to have knowledge of the unseen future are all fortunetellers, and it is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever goes to a fortuneteller and asks him (about anything), his prayer will not be accepted from him for forty days.” And if he believes him then he is a kafir because if he believes that he has knowledge of the unseen, then he has disbelieved in the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning):
“Say: None in the heavens and the earth knows the Ghaib (unseen) except Allah.” [27:65].
[Majmoo’ Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen]
And Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about the ruling on one who claims to have knowledge of the unseen. He replied:
The ruling on one who claims to have knowledge of the unseen is that he is a kafir, because he has disbelieved in Allah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Say: None in the heavens and the earth knows the Ghaib (unseen) except Allah, nor can they perceive when they shall be resurrected.” [27:65]
If Allah has commanded His Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to proclaim to all that no one in the heavens or on earth has knowledge of the unseen except Allah, then whoever claims to have knowledge of the unseen has denied what Allah has told us here.
We say to them: How can you possibly have knowledge of the unseen when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not have knowledge of the unseen? Are you better or the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)? If they say, “We are better than the Messenger” then they become kafirs by saying that. If they say, “He is better,” then why was the unseen concealed from him but you have knowledge of it?? Allah says of Himself (interpretation of the meaning):
“(He Alone is) the All‑Knower of the Ghayb (unseen), and He reveals to none His Ghayb (nseen).
Except to a Messenger (from mankind) whom He has chosen (He informs him of the unseen as much as He likes), and then He makes a band of watching guards (angels) to march before him and behind him.” [72:26]
The second verse attests to the kufr (disbelief) of the one who claims to have knowledge of the unseen. And Allah commanded His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to announce to all (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say (O Muhammad): I don’t tell you that with me are the treasures of Allah, nor (that) I know the unseen; nor I tell you that I am an angel. I but follow what is revealed to me.”
[6:50]
[Majmoo’ Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen]
The one who predicts the future is called a kahin (fortuneteller, soothsayer), and it is not permissible to ask questions of such a person or to go to him or her. If their predictions are sometimes correct, that is either a coincidence or because the jinn have intercepted the news and conveyed it to the fortuneteller, but they add a hundred lies to it. 
It was narrated that ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: Some people asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about fortunetellers. He said: “They are nothing.” They said: “O Messenger of Allah, sometimes they tell us something and it is true.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “That is a word of the truth that they learn from the jinni which he whispers into the ear of his familiar, but they mix a hundred lies with it.” [al-Bukhari, Muslim]. 
Al-Hafiz ibn Hajar said: 
Al-Qurtubi said: During the Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic days og ignorance) they used to consult the fortunetellers about events and rulings, and follow what they said. Then the fortunetellers stopped when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was sent. But there are still some who resemble them. It is forbidden to go to them, so it is not permissible to go to them or to believe them. 
In the version narrated by Yoonus the phrase “sometimes they tell us something and it is true” appears as “they tell something and it turns out to be true.” This phrase has confused the questioner because of the general meaning of the phrase “They are nothing”, which he has understood to mean that they never get anything right. But the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commented that although they sometimes coincidentally get things right, it is never completely right for it is always contaminated with many lies.  
Al-Khattabi said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained that the reason why the fortuneteller sometimes gets it right is that the jinni tells him of something that he has heard by eavesdropping on the angels, and he adds lies to that to embellish what he heard. So occasionally he gets it right but usually it is wrong. [Fath al-Bari]. 
With regard to what is mentioned in the question of what this woman sees in her dreams, such dreams are not to be taken as evidence concerning rulings of sharee’ah (Islamic law), let alone whatever they may indicate that goes against any matter of ‘aqeedah (belief) that is confirmed in the texts of Islam. Whatever she sees in her dreams is to be regarded as the shaytan’s toying with her and taking advantage of her ignorance.

45597,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/45597,Speaking during intercourse to provoke desire,"Is it permissible to say inappropriate words (i.e., words that are not permissible) during intercourse in order to provoke desire in one's wife?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is permissible for both husband and wife to say whatever they want to provoke desire during intercourse, and that does not have to be something that was narrated in the Sunnah, but it is not permissible to say anything that is forbidding in Islam, such as lies or slanderous words. But with regard to mentioning the genitals by their colloquial names or other things that provoke desire in word or deed, the basic principle is that it is permissible. 
Some of the scholars are of the view that this is makrooh, and they regarded it as contrary to proper etiquette. But the correct view is that it is permissible. Even if we accept that it is makrooh, then that ruling may be lifted when there is the least need for it, and the need here is obvious. 
If it is permissible for the husband to touch his wife’s private part, look at it and enjoy it, then it is more appropriate that he is permitted to call it by a name that will provoke his wife; and the converse is also permitted.
