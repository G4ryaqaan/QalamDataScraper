23265,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/23265,Ruling on asking of Allaah by virtue of the status of the righteous before Him,"Will Allah honour the living slave by virtue of the righteous dead if we ask of Allah “by virtue of the righteousness of Shaykh So and so and his position before You and his worship of You, to relieve me of my distress, O Allah” – when we know that all benefits come from Allah?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Undoubtedly du’aa’ is one of the greatest acts of worship prescribed in sharee’ah. It brings a person closer to his Lord, may He be glorified. And undoubtedly it is not permissible for anyone to worship Allah except in the ways that He has prescribed on the lips of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Al-Bukhari (2499) and Muslim (3242) narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever innovates something in this matter of ours that is not part of it, will have it rejected.” According to the version narrated by Muslim: “Whoever does something that is not part of this matter of ours will have it rejected.” 
Hence it may be known that turning to Allah and beseeching Him in ways that were not narrated from His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in word or in deed, and in ways that were not done by the noble Sahaabah who were the keenest of people to do good and adhere to it, is a reprehensible innovation, which a person who loves his Lord and follows His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) should not do and should not worship Allah in that manner. 
If we look at what you have mentioned in your question about beseeching Allah by virtue of the status of the righteous, their worship and their position before Allah, we will notice that this is something that has been innovated and was not narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Nor was it narrated from his noble companions that they ever sought to draw close to Allah by virtue of the Prophet’s position and status before his Lord, whether during his lifetime or after his death. Rather during his lifetime they used to beseech Allah by virtue of his du’aa’ for them, and when he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) died, they sought to draw closer to Allah by virtue of the du’aa’s of the living righteous, and they stopped seeking to draw closer to Him by virtue of the Prophet’s status. This clearly indicates that if beseeching Allah or seeking to draw closer to Him by virtue of the Prophet’s status were something good and prescribed in Islam, they would have done it before us. Who dares claim that he is keener than ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allah be pleased with him) to do good when he turned away from seeking to draw closer to Allah by virtue of the status of His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and sought to draw closer to Him by virtue of the du’aa’ of the paternal uncle of the Prophet, and the Sahaabah witnessed that and did not denounce him or object to that? It is narrated in Saheeh al-Bukhari (954) from Anas ibn Maalik that if a drought came, ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allah be pleased with him) would ask al-‘Abbaas ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib to pray for rain. He would say: “O Allah, we used to beseech You by means of (the du’aa’ of) Your Prophet for rain and You would give us rain; now we beseech You by means of (the du’aa’ of) the paternal uncle of Your Prophet, so grant us rain.” Then it would rain.  
What is meant by their beseeching Allah by mean of the du’aa’ of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or of al-‘Abbaas is beseeching Him through their du’aa’, based on what is said in some versions of this hadeeth, that Anas said: “If drought came at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), they would ask him to pray for rain, and he would pray for rain for them, then it would rain. During the caliphate of ‘Umar…” and he narrated the same hadeeth. This was narrated by al-Ismaa’eeli in his al-Mustakhraj ‘ala’l-Saheeh. ‘Abd al-Razzaaq narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas that “‘Umar prayed for rain in the prayer-place, and he said to al-‘Abbaas: ‘Get up and pray for rain.’ So al-‘Abbaas got up …” and he quoted the hadeeth. This was quoted by al-Haafiz in al-Fath and he did not comment on it. 
Thus it is clear that the beseeching meant by ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) is du’aa’ by a righteous man. This is the correct kind of beseeching as prescribed in sharee’ah, and is indicated by a great deal of evidence. It was known at the time of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them). If they were threatened with drought and there was no rain, they would ask the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to pray for them, and he would pray, then it would rain. There are many well-known ahaadeeth about this. 
It says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (1/153): 
It is not permissible to supplicate Allah (du’aa’) by virtue of the Messenger of Allah or by virtue of any of the Sahaabah or anyone else, or by the life of anyone, because acts of worship are tawqeefi (i.e., we must adhere to what is prescribed in the Qur’aan and Sunnah and not worship Allah in any way except that which has been prescribed). Beseeching Allah in the manner described (in the question) has not been prescribed by Allah, rather He has commanded His slaves to beseech Him by His names and attributes, by believing in His Oneness, by having faith in Him, and by virtue of one’s righteous deeds – not by virtue of the status of So and so or by his life. So we must limit ourselves to that which Allah has prescribed. Hence it is known that beseeching Allah by virtue of the status or life of So and so is an innovation that has been introduced into Islam. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: No one has the right to pride himself before Allah on the righteousness of his forebears, for their righteousness is not part of his deeds for which he may deserve reward, as in the case of the three people in the cave. They did not beseech Allah by the righteousness of their forebears, rather they beseeched Allah by virtue of their own righteous deeds.
 We ask Allah to make us steadfast in adhering to His religion and His sharee’ah until we meet Him… 
And Allah knows best.

23269,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/23269,Does touching with desire count as taking back a divorced wife?,"For about 2 years now my husband and I have been having extreme marry difficulties, the problems have gotten soo bad that it has ended up in 2 divorces, the first divorce he took me back (having intercourse with me), the second divorce he just touched me (without having intercourse),but the touch was in a romatic way. He claims that I am still divorced, because he says that he has to have actual intercourse with me, I have passed one period, so he says that I have 2 more left and my iddah is over, is he right? or did he take me back even though he did not have intercourse with me he just touched me?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    Taking back the wife during the ‘iddah period is a right 
    which sharee’ah gives to the husband. If he wants, he may take her back and 
    if he wants, he may leave his wife until the ‘iddah period is over. Allaah 
    says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And their husbands have the better right to take them 
    back in that period, if they wish for reconciliation”

    [al-Baqarah 2:228]

    So Allaah has given the husbands of divorced women the right 
    to take them back during this period [i.e., the ‘iddah] if they intend 
    reconciliation thereby. 

    This taking back may be achieved in two ways: by word or by 
    deed. 

    Taking the wife back by word means saying, for example, “I 
    take back my wife” or “I am keeping my wife,” etc., or saying to her: “I 
    take you back,” or “I am keeping you,” etc. 

    Taking back is achieved by means of these phrases, according 
    to the consensus of the fuqaha’. 

    Writing may take the place of speaking, and a gesture may 
    take its place on the part of one who is unable to speak these words, such 
    as one who is mute. 

    Taking the wife back by deed means intercourse, so long as 
    that is with the intention of reconciliation. 

    Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Sa’di said: 
If the husband had divorced her with a 
    revocable talaaq, then if the ‘iddah is over she is not permissible for him 
    unless a new marriage contract is done, fulfilling all necessary conditions. 
    If the ‘iddah is not yet over, and if the intention behind intercourse is 
    reconciliation, then this is taking her back and intercourse is permissible. 
    If there is no intention of reconciliation then according to the madhhab 
    this means that he has taken her back, but according to the correct view 
    this does not mean that he has taken her back, therefore intercourse is 
    haraam. 

    Al-Irshaad ila Ma’rifat al-Ahkaam. 

    Based on this, then your husband’s merely touching you is not 
    regarded as him taking you back. 

    See also the answer to question no.
    11798. 

    This is the view of the majority of scholars (including Imam 
    Maalik, al-Shaafa’i and Ahmad), that taking back the wife is not achieved by 
    merely touching with desire. But Imam Maalik said: Taking back is achieved 
    by touching with desire if the intention is to take the wife back. So long 
    as your husband says that he that he did not intend to take you back, then 
    he did not take you back by doing that. 

    See al-Mughni, 7/404; al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 
    13/187. 

    Secondly: 

    With regard to the ‘iddah of a woman divorced by a revocable 
    talaaq, it is three menstrual cycles for women who menstruate, so there are 
    two cycles left for you as your husband said, then your ‘iddah will be over. 
    If he took you back during this time then this divorce is counted as one of 
    the three talaaqs, and he has to bring people to witness that he is taking 
    you back. So he has one talaaq left, and if he does not take you back during 
    the ‘iddah period then you are divorced from him, and it is not permissible 
    for him to go back to you except with a new marriage contract and a new 
    ‘iddah, and the marriage cannot be completed except with your consent and 
    the agreement of your wali (guardian).

23273,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/23273,How important is it for a new Muslim to change his name?,"Upon becoming muslim, how important is it to change your name?and what is the differance between an arabic name and a muslim name?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Names carry meanings, and every person will be influenced by (the meaning of) his name, in most cases. Man is required to call himself – or his children – by good names with good meanings, so that they will be influenced positively by their names. 
Islam came to the Arabs and the non-Arabs, and it is not essential for a new Muslim to take an Arabic name, rather what is required is that he should not have a name that is ugly or carries a meaning that goes against Islam. Many Persians and Byzantines embraced Islam and kept their names, and did not change them. Indeed many of the Prophets had names that were not Arabic because they were not Arabs. 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: Does a person who becomes Muslim have to change his name like George or Joseph etc? 
He replied: 
He does not have to change his name unless it is a name that reflects servitude to someone or something other than Allaah, but it is good to change his name to something better.  So if he changes his name from a foreign name to an Islamic name, that is good, but as to whether it is obligatory, no it is not. 
But if his name was ‘Abd al-Maseeh [= “slave of the Messiah”, a name common among Arab Christians; a similar name in English cultures would be “Christopher” -- Translator] or something of that nature, then he should change it, but if the name does not imply servitude to anything or anyone other than Allaah, such as George and Paul, etc., then he does not have to change it, because these names are shared by Christians and others.

    It is prescribed for the Muslim to pray for peace for the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and to send salaams 
    upon him, just as it is prescribed to pray for blessings for him. The 
    evidence that it is prescribed to send salaams upon the Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is the verse in which Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Allaah sends His Salaah (Graces, Honours, Blessings, 
    Mercy) on the Prophet (Muhammad), and also His angels (ask Allaah to bless 
    and forgive him). O you who believe! Send your Salaah on (ask Allaah to 
    bless) him (Muhammad), and (you should) greet (salute) him with the Islamic 
    way of greeting (salutation, i.e. As‑Salaamu ‘Alaykum)”

    [al-Ahzaab 33:56]

    It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah said: the Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah has 
    angels who travel about the earth, conveying to me the salaams of my ummah.” 
    (Saheeh Sunan al-Nasaa’i, 1215; al-Silsilat al-Saheehah, 
    2853). 

    It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah said: “When we prayed with 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) we used to say, 
    ‘Peace be upon Allaah from His slaves and peace be upon So and so.’ The 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, ‘Do not say 
    “Peace (salaam) be upon Allaah”, for Allaah Himself is al-Salaam. Rather 
    say, “Al-tahiyyaatu Lillaahi wa’l-salawaatu wa’l-tayyibaat. Al-salaamu 
    ‘alayka ayyuha’l-Nabiyyu wa rahmat Allaahi wa barakaatuhu. Al-salaamu 
    ‘alayna wa ‘ala ibaad-illaah il-saaliheen (All compliments, prayers and 
    pure words are due to Allaah. Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and the mercy of 
    Allaah and His blessings. Peace be on us, and on the righteous slaves of 
    Allaah).” If you say this it will be for all the slaves in heaven and 
    between the heavens and the earth. [Then go on to say] “Ash-hadu an laa 
    ilaaha ill-Allaah wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadan ‘abduhu wa rasooluhu (I 
    bear witness that there is no god except Allaah and I bear witness that 
    Muhammad is His slave and Messenger).” Then choose whichever du’aa’ you like 
    and recite it.’”

    (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 835) 

    It was narrated that Faatimah, the daughter of the Messenger 
    of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When the 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) entered 
    the mosque, he would say, ‘Bismillaah wa’l-salaam ‘ala Rasool-illaah. 
    Allaahumma ighfir li dhunoobi waftah li abwaab rahmatika (In the name of 
    Allaah, and peace be upon the Messenger of Allaah. O Allaah, forgive me my 
    sins and open to me the gates of Your Mercy).’ And when he exited he would 
    say, Bismillaah wa’l-salaam ‘ala Rasool-illaah. Allaahumma ighfir li 
    dhunoobi waftah li abwaab fadlika (In the name of Allaah, and peace be 
    upon the Messenger of Allaah. O Allaah, forgive me my sins and open to me 
    the gates of Your Bounty).’”

    (Saheeh Sunan Ibn Maajah, 625) 
It was narrated from Abu 
    Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “There is no one who sends salaams upon me, but Allaah will 
    restore to me my soul so that I may return his salaams.”

    (Saheeh Sunan Abi Dawood, 1795) 

    It was narrated from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Abi Talhah from his 
    father that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) came one day with evident signs of happiness on his face, and he 
    said: “Jibreel  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came to me 
    and said, ‘Would it not please you, O Muhammad, to know that no one among 
    your ummah will send blessings upon you but I will send ten blessings upon 
    him, and no one among your ummah will send salaams upon you but I will send 
    ten salaams upon him.” 

    (Saheeh Sunan al-Nasaa’i, 1228) 
Sending salaams upon the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is one of the 
    rights that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) has 
    over his ummah. The Muslim is commanded to do this either in general word or 
    in the specific phrases narrated in the reports, such as sending salaam on 
    him in the Tashahhud, and when entering or leaving the mosque. The command 
    to send salaams upon him  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    even in his absence is one of the unique blessings that Allaah has bestowed 
    upon him alone, which he does not share with anyone else, for it is not 
    prescribed to send salaams upon any specific person in his absence apart 
    from him  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Another of his 
    unique privileges is that the salaams of his ummah are conveyed to him, so a 
    person may attain the virtue of sending salaams upon the Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and it reaching him even if he did not 
    have the opportunity to meet him during his lifetime and even if a person is 
    not able to go to his grave after he died. 

    With regard to praying for blessing for the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), this is also prescribed in 
    Islam. One of the reports that prove that it is prescribed is the saheeh 
    report from Abu Mas’ood al_Ansaari who said: “The Messenger of Allaah  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came to us when we were sitting 
    with Sa’d ibn ‘Ubaadah, and Basheer ibn Sa’d said to him: ‘Allaah has 
    commanded us to send blessings upon you, O Messenger of Allaah. How should 
    we send blessings upon you?’ The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) remained silent until we wished that he had 
    not asked him. Then the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “Say: Allaahumma salli ‘ala Muhammad wa ‘ala 
    aali Muhammad kamaa salayta ‘ala aali Ibraaheem. Wa baarik ‘ala Muhammad wa 
    ‘ala aali Muhammad kama baarakta ‘ala aali Ibraaheem fi’l-‘aalameen innaka 
    hameedun majeed (O Allaah, send blessings upon Muhammad and upon the 
    family of Muhammad, as You sent blessings upon the family of Ibraaheem, and 
    bless Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, as You blessed the family of 
    Ibraheem among the nations. Verily You are Most Praiseworthy, Full of 
    Glory). And the salaam is as you know.”

    (Narrated by Muslim, 405) 

    Sending salaams upon the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) may be done by saying “Al-salaamu ‘alayka 
    ayyuha’l-Nabiyyu wa rahmat Allaahi wa barakaatuhu (peace be upon you, O 
    Prophet, and the mercy of Allaah and His blessings). Or it may take the form 
    of a du’aa’, praying that Allaah may keep him sound, such as saying Sall 
    Allaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam (may Allaah send blessings and peace upon him 
    [i.e., the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)]. A 
    person’s sending salaam upon the Prophet may be done by mentioning Allaah’s 
    name al-Salaam by way of seeking the blessing of that name and this name is 
    suited to the context because you are asking Allaah to keep him safe and 
    sound, as if one is saying “O Allaah, Whose name is al-Salaam, keep your 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) safe and sound.” 
    When the word Salaam refers to the name of Allaah, it appears with 
    the definite article al-, unlike when the word salaam appears 
    in the context of praying for peace, tranquility and soundness to be 
    bestowed by Allaah upon His slaves, in which case it appears without the 
    definite article. “Because salaam from Him means any amount of salaam, and 
    any amount of salaam from Him will be sufficient to make any slave of Allaah 
    have no need of salaam from anyone else and no need for any greeting from 
    anyone else; and any salaam from Allaah will be sufficient to grant him all 
    of his wishes. So the least salaam from Allaah – and nothing can be 
    described as least when it comes from Allaah – will bring the greatest 
    blessings and will ward off all causes of misery, and will make life good 
    and will ward off all causes of doom and destruction. Therefore in this 
    context, when speaking of salaam from Allaah, there is no need for the 
    definite article.”

    See Dabaa’i’ al-Fawaa’id, 2/143 

    What is meant by salaam is being free from evil and faults. 
    So the one who sends salaams upon the Prophet is praying for him  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in this sense, asking for the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to be protecte from evil, 
    faults and shortcomings. As for blessings (barakah), what this means is 
    steadfastness and stability. Blessing means growth and increase. 

     What is meant by praying for blessing for the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is asking Allaah to bestow good 
    upon him, to make it lasting, to increase and multiply it.

The followers of the madhhabs are not all the same. Some of them are mujtahids within their madhhab, and some are followers (muqallids) who do not go against their madhhabs in any regard. 
Al-Buwayti, al-Muzani, al-Nawawi and Ibn Hajr were followers of Imam al-Shaafa’i, but they were also mujtahids in their own right and differed with their imam when they had evidence. Similarly Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr was a Maaliki but he differed with Maalik if the correct view was held by someone else. The same may be said of the Hanafi imams such as Abu Yoosuf and Muhammad al-Shaybaani, and the Hanbali imams such as Ibn Qudaamah, Ibn Muflih and others. 
The fact that a student studied with a madhhab does not mean that he cannot go beyond it if he finds sound evidence elsewhere; the only one who stubbornly clings to a particular madhhab (regardless of the evidence) is one who lacking in religious commitment and intellect, or he is doing that because of partisan attachment to his madhhab.  
The advice of the leading imams is that students should acquire knowledge from where they acquired it, and they should ignore the words of their imams if they go against the hadeeth of the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
Abu Haneefah said: “This is my opinion, but if there comes someone whose opinion is better than mine, then accept that.” Maalik said: “I am only human, I may be right or I may be wrong, so measure my words by the Qur’aan and Sunnah.” Al-Shaafa’i said: “If the hadeeth is saheeh, then ignore my words. If you see well established evidence, then this is my view.” Imam Ahmad said: “Do not follow me blindly, and do not follow Maalik or al-Shaafa’i or al-Thawri blindly. Learn as we have learned.” And he said, “Do not follow men blindly with regard to your religion, for they can never be safe from error.” 
No one has the right to follow an imam blindly and never accept anything but his worlds. Rather what he must do is accept that which is in accordance with the truth, whether it is from his imam or anyone else. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: 
No one has to blindly follow any particular man in all that he enjoins or forbids or recommends, apart from the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). The Muslims should always refer their questions to the Muslim scholars, following this one sometimes and that one sometimes. If the follower decides to follow the view of an imam with regard to a particular matter which he thinks is better for his religious commitment or is more correct etc, that is permissible according to the majority of Muslim scholars, and neither Abu Haneefah, Maalik, al-Shaafa’i or Ahmad said that this was forbidden. 
Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 23/382. 
Shaykh Sulaymaan ibn ‘Abd-Allaah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
Rather what the believer must do, if the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) have reached him and he understands them with regard to any matter, is to act in accordance with them, no matter who he may be disagreeing with. This is what our Lord and our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) have enjoined upon us, and all the scholars are unanimously agreed on that, apart from the ignorant blind followers and the hard-hearted. Such people are not scholars. 
Tayseer al-‘Azeez al-Hameed, p. 546 
Based on this, there is nothing wrong with a Muslim being a follower of a certain madhhab, but if it becomes clear to him that the truth (concerning a given matter) is different from the view of his madhhab, then he must follow the truth. 
With regard to Ibn Hazm, he was an imam and a mujtahid, and he regarded blind following as haraam. He was not a follower of any of the imams, neither Imam Ahmad nor any other imam. Rather he was the imam of ahl al-zaahir (the Zaahiris or literalists) during his own time and until now. Perhaps the view that he was a follower of Imam Ahmad (if this report is true) has to do with matters of aqeedah and Tawheed, even though he held different opinions and reckless views with regard to issues pertaining to the divine names and attributes.

 Seek reward with Allaah, for Allaah tests His slaves to see which of them will be patient, and He raises their status when they are patient, and gives them a way out. This is one of the main ways of dealing with such situations, and is indeed the most important way. 
Now we will discuss the matter step by step. 
First of all you mention that when you call your husband, he gives the excuse that he is tired. 
1 – Have you tried to talk to him about this matter? If you talk to him you will probably find out some things of which you were unaware. Some men may be affected by impotence which makes them give excuses to their wives, but they feel too embarrassed to explain the reason. Some of them even try to avoid the issue and the only thing that can do is to resort these bad magazines to prove to himself and to those around him that he is still a man. 
You should sit with him and talk frankly, and explain to him in a gentle and kind manner that you are his loving wife and that one of your rights over him is that he should fulfil your desires – which Allaah has created in you –, and that you would like to know the reason why, and that this will increase your respect for him and will not affect your married life or your opinion of him. A man always fears that he will regarded as lacking somehow, especially in his wife’s eyes. Perhaps he will tell you other reasons and you can evaluate them according to what you know about your married life. 
2 – Perhaps you can also try writing a letter, discussing the issue in a gentle and tactful manner, because this has also proven to be a useful means which, by Allaah’s grace, has helped to solve some problems, especially when one of the parties has refused to talk or it is difficult to discuss it with him. 
3 – Find out the ways to your husband’s heart. Wear the kind of clothes that he likes you to wear, put on some nice perfume of the kind that he likes most, and try to change the daily routine and introduce something new into your lives.  
4 – Tell him of your love and respect for him, through a scented letter, beautiful words and other means. You could write some nice words on the mirror, for example, or give him a gift with some words from the heart written on it, which will tell him of your love for him. 
5 – A smile charms all people, especially men. Look at him with love and a heartfelt smile. Send him your love whilst looking at him, without saying anything, as long as that comes from the depths of your heart.  
6 – Try to draw closer to your husband with the words and actions that he loves, seeking thereby the pleasure of Allaah. If you find that you have done all that you can, you can bring in a mediator whom you know your husband trusts and who is wise and persuasive, without telling him exactly what is going on between you, to hint to him and discuss the rights and duties of marriage with him, without him telling your husband that you have mentioned that to him or that you have asked him to intervene. But this is subject to the condition that he should be a person who is known for his good morals, upright nature and chastity. 
7 – You should call him, kindly, to give up that which angers Allaah, such as these magazines, in an indirect manner; such leaving in a place near where he sleeps a fatwa saying that this is not permissible, or playing a tape with a lecture or lesson that may move him, or trying to recite soorahs of the Qur’aan near him. 
8 – I wish that you would banish the idea of separation from your mind, and strive hard and be patient, so that you may attain a great reward and a high status before Allaah, because if you leave him, you may not necessarily find another suitable husband. Moreover, if you have children, this makes it even more important for you to be patient, unless it is impossible to be patient and you find that you have no other choice but to leave, in which case you may do so. 
9 – Take care of yourself and your own life and faith. Strengthening your relationship with Allaah will make things easier for you and will give you peace of mind and certain faith. Look to the future and be certain that it will be better, so long as you remain close to Allaah. Ask Him for that in your prayers constantly. If you can set aside some times when you occupy yourself with good things or do some voluntary work for charity or some da’wah activities with some sisters, then these good deeds will strengthen your personality and make it attractive.  
10 – Distract yourself from thinking about your husband, if only for a short while. Distract yourself with other things such as a simple project or participating in some internet web sites to fill your time. Remember to relax with some things that do not go against Islam so that you can have the strength to carry on. 
Finally, you have three “keys” at your disposal which will help you in all your affairs by Allaah’s leave: 
1 – Du’aa’. There is nothing that Allaah cannot do on earth or in heaven. Seek out the times when du’aa’s are answered, such as the last part of the night, the last hour of Friday, between the adhaan and iqaamah, and also when fasting, and when prostrating. Make a lot of du’aa’ and ask Allaah to make you righteous and guide you, ask Him to bring you both closer together and to take away the things that are upsetting you, and ask Him for His forgiveness and to keep you safe and sound. 
2 – Certainty of faith, thinking positively of Allaah, for He is able to do whatever He wills when He wills. 
3 – Patience, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) advised Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him): “Remember that there is much good in bearing with patience that which you dislike, and that victory comes with patience, and that with hardship comes a way out and with difficulty comes ease.” Narrated by Ahmad, 2800. And as the saying goes: the world has never seen a patient man who did not get what he wanted, and if he did not get what he wanted, he got something better and greater than that, by Allaah’s leave. 
Remember that one hardship cannot overcome two reliefs. Allaah has promised His slaves that with every hardship comes two reliefs as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, along with every hardship is relief,
6. Verily, along with every hardship is relief”
[al-Sharh 94:5-6]
Ask Allaah to reconcile between you and to make your husband a delight to you, and to bring you together in this world and in the Hereafter.

23290,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/23290,"“Were it not for you, I would not have created the universe.”","I have got a question regarding a hadeeth (prophetic narration). How sound is the hadeeth that states, that were it not for Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) Allah would not have created this world?

To be honest I am a bit suspicious about this hadeeth, could you shed some light on the matter?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Many false and fabricated ahadeeth (narrations) have been narrated that say similar things. 
    For example: 

    “Were it not for 
    you, I would not have created the universe.” 

    This was quoted by 
    al-Shawkani in al-Fawaid al-Majmoo’ah fi’l-Ahadeeth al-Mawdoo’ah (p. 326). 
    He said:  

    Al-San’ani said: 
    (it is) mawdoo’ (fabricated). 

    Al-Albani said in 
    al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah (282): (it is) mawdoo’. 

    Another example is 
    the hadeeth narrated by al-Hakim according to which Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be 
    pleased with him) said: 

    “Allah revealed to 
    ‘Eesa (Jesus, peace be upon him): ‘O ‘Eesa, believe in Muhammad, and tell 
    whoever you meet of your ummah (followers) to believe in him. For were it 
    not for Muhammad, I would not have created Adam, and were it not for 
    Muhammad, I would not have created Paradise and Hell. I created the Throne 
    over the water and it would not settle until I wrote on it, La ilaha 
    ill-Allah Muhammad Rasool Allah (There is no god but Allah and Muhammad is 
    the Messenger of Allah).” 

    Al-Hakim said: its 
    isnad (chain of narration) is saheeh! But al-Thahabi commented on this and 
    said: I believe it is fabricated and falsely attributed to Sa’eed. 

    Meaning, Sa’eed 
    ibn Abu ‘Aroobah (one of the narrators of this hadeeth). This hadeeth was 
    narrated from him by ‘Amr ibn Aws al-Ansari, who is the one who is accused 
    of fabricating it. Al-Thahabi mentioned him in al-Meezan where he said: “He 
    produced a munkar (rejected) report,” then he quoted this hadeeth, and said, 
    “I believe that it is mawdoo’ (fabricated).” Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar agreed with 
    him, as it says in al-Lisan. 

    Al-Albani said in 
    al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah (280): There is no basis for it. 

    Shaykh al-Islam 
    Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: 

    Is the hadeeth 
    which some people quote – “Were it not for you, Allah would not have created 
    the Throne or the Kursiy (lit. Footstool) or the earth or the heavens or the 
    sun or the moon or anything else” saheeh or not? 

    He replied:

    Muhammad (peace 
    and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the leader of the sons of Adam (peace 
    be upon him), and the best and noblest of creation, hence some people say 
    that Allah created the universe because of him, or that were it not for him, 
    Allah would not have created the Throne or the Kursiy or the earth or the 
    heavens or the sun or the moon. 

    But this hadeeth 
    that is narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) 
    is neither saheeh (sound) nor da’eef (weak), and it was not narrated by any 
    scholar in a hadeeth from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon 
    him). Neither was it known from the Sahabah/Companions (may Allah be pleased 
    with them). Rather it is the words of one who is unknown. 

    Majmoo’ al-Fatawa, 
    11/86-96. 

    The Standing 
    Committee was asked: 

    Can it be said 
    that Allah created the heavens and the earth for the purpose of creating the 
    Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)? What is the meaning of 
    the hadeeth, “Were it not for you the universe would not have been created,” 
    and does this hadeeth have any basis? 

    They replied: 

    The heavens and 
    the earth were not created for the sake of the Prophet (peace and blessings 
    of Allah be upon him), rather they were created for the purpose which Allah 
    mentions (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “It is Allah Who 
    has created seven heavens and of the earth the like thereof (i.e. seven). 
    His Command descends between them (heavens and earth), that you may know 
    that Allah has power over all things, and that Allah surrounds all things in 
    (His) Knowledge.” [65:12] 

    As for the hadeeth 
    mentioned, it is falsely attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of 
    Allah be upon him) and has no sound basis. 

    Fatawa al-Lajnah 
    al-Daimah, 1/312 

    Shaykh Ibn Baz was 
    asked about this hadeeth and he said: 

    The answer is that 
    this was transmitted from the words of some of the common people who have no 
    understanding. Some people say that the world was created for the sake of 
    Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and were it not for 
    Muhammad the world would not have been created and mankind would not have 
    been created. This is false and has no basis, and these are corrupt words. 
    Allah created the world so that He would be known and worshipped. He created 
    the world and He created mankind so that His names and attributes, His power 
    and knowledge, would be known and so that He alone would be worshipped with 
    no partner or associate, and so that He would be obeyed – not for the sake 
    of Muhammad or for the sake of Nooh or Moosa or ‘Eesa or any other Prophet 
    (peace be upon them all). Rather Allah created the universe so that He alone 
    would be worshipped, with no partner or associate.

He died in childhood, and it was said that he lived until he was old enough to ride. Then came Zaynab, and it was said that she was older than al-Qasim; then Ruqayyah, Umm Kulthum and Fatimah . 
It was said concerning each of them that she was older than her two sisters.
It was narrated from Ibn `Abbas that Ruqayyah was the oldest of the three and that Umm Kulthum was the youngest. 
Then ‘Abd-Allah was born to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). There is some dispute as to whether he was born after the Prophet’s Prophethood began or before. Some scholars said that he was born after his Prophethood began. There is also some dispute as to whether he was al-Tayyib or al-Tahir, or whether they were other children; the correct view is that these were nicknames given to him; and Allah knows best. 
These children were all born from Khadijah and he had no children from any other wife. 
Then Ibrahim was born to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) from his concubine Mariyah al-Qibtiyyah in 8 AH. (Zaad al-Ma’ad, 1/103) 
So the sons and daughters of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) were all born to him from his wife Umm al-Mu’minin Khadijah (may Allah be pleased with her), apart from Ibrahim, who was born from the Prophet’s concubine Mariyah (may Allah be pleased with her), who was given to him as a gift by al-Muqawqis, the king of Alexandria and the leader of the Copts.

23296,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/23296,Who Is Exempt from fasting during Ramadan?,What are the reasons for which one may be excused from fasting in Ramadan?,"These are the valid reasons for breaking the fast during Ramadan:  1- sickness, 2- traveling, 3 - pregnancy and breastfeeding, 4- senility and old age, 5- intense hunger and thirst, and 6- compulsion.","Valid reasons for breaking fast


Sickness 


Traveling 


Cancellation of the concession for traveling 




Pregnancy and breastfeeding 


Senility and old age 


Intense hunger and thirst 


Compulsion","Praise be to Allah.One of the ways in which Allah has made things easy for His slaves is that He has only enjoined fasting upon those who are able to do it, and He has excused those who are unable to fast for a legitimate shar’i reason. 
Valid reasons for breaking fast
The legitimate reasons for which one may be excused from fasting are as follows: 
Sickness 
Sickness means everything that means that a person is not healthy.  
Ibn Qudamah said: 
“The scholars agree that it is permissible for the sick person not to fas t in general. The basis of that is the ayah in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“but if any of you is ill or on a journey, the same number (should be made up) from other days.” [al-Baqarah 2:184]
It was narrated that Salamah ibn al-Akwa’ (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “When this ayah was revealed – ‘And as for those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g. an old man), they have (a choice either to fast or) to feed a Miskin (poor person) (for every day)’ [al-Baqarah 2:184 – interpretation of the meaning] – those who wanted not to fast could do that, and pay the fidyah (i.e., feed one poor person for each day). That remained the case until the following ayah was revealed, i.e., the verse: 
‘And as for those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g. an old man), they have (a choice either to fast or) to feed a Miskin (poor person) (for every day)’
[al-Baqarah 2:184 – interpretation of the meaning] – so it abrogated it.”  
The sick person who fears that fasting may make his sickness worse or that it will slow down his recovery or damage a part of his body, has the option of not fasting, and indeed it is Sunnah for him not to fast and it is makruh for him to complete his fast, because that may lead to his death. So he has to be cautious and protect himself. Moreover, if the sick person is very ill, that makes it permissible for him not to fast. But if a healthy person fears difficulty or tiredness, it is not permissible for him to break his fast, if all that happens to him when he fasts is that he becomes tired. 
Traveling 
In order for traveling to result in a concession excusing one from fasting, the following conditions must be met: 

The journey must be long enough that prayers may be shortened.
The traveler must not intend to settle in the place to which he travels.
His journey must not be for any sinful purpose, rather it should be for a sound purpose, according to the majority of scholars. That is because being allowed not to fast is a concession and relief that the sinner does not deserve on his journey, because the purpose of his journey is to commit sin – such as one who travels in order to commit banditry, for example.

Cancellation of the concession for traveling 
This concession of traveling is cancelled by two things: 

When the traveler returns home and enters his hometown, which is the place where he resides.
When the traveler decides to stay indefinitely, or for a lengthy period in one place, and the place is fit for settling in. Thus he becomes a resident (or non-traveller), so he should pray his prayers in full and not break his fast in Ramadan, because the rulings on travel no longer apply to him.

Pregnancy and breastfeeding 
The fuqaha are agreed that pregnant and breastfeeding women may break their fast in Ramadan, on the condition that they think there is a risk that they or their children may become ill or more ill, or be harmed or may die. The evidence for this concession in their case is the ayah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number [of days which one did not observe Sawm (fasts) must be made up] from other days ” [al-Baqarah 2:185]
This does not refer to merely being sick, for the sick person who will not be harmed by fasting is not allowed to break the fast; here sickness is mentioned as a metaphor for any situation where fasting when sick may cause harm. This is what is meant by sickness here. That may be the case in pregnancy and when breastfeeding, so these two cases are included in the concession of breaking the fast. The evidence that women in these cases are allowed not to fast is the hadith of Anas ibn Malik al-Ka’bi (may Allah be pleased with him), who said that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has relieved the traveler of fasting and half of prayer, and He has relieved the pregnant and breastfeeding woman of fasting.”  
Senility and old age 
Senility and old age refers to one who is old and has lost his strength, or who is approaching death, so that every day he becomes weaker, until he dies, or who is suffering from a terminal or incurable illness and has no hope of recovery. The evidence that it is prescribed for such people not to fast is the ayah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And as for those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g. an old man), they have (a choice either to fast or) to feed a Miskin (poor person) (for every day)” [al-Baqarah 2:184]
Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said that this ayah has not been abrogated, and it applies to old men and old women who cannot fast, so for each day they should feed one poor person. 
Intense hunger and thirst 
If a person is overtaken by intense hunger or unbearable thirst , then he should break his fast and eat just as much as he needs to ward off that hunger, then he should refrain from eating for the rest of the day, and make up for that fast later on. 
The scholars added to intense hunger and thirst the fear of weakness when meeting the enemy, or fearing or expecting an attack, such as when one is surrounded. So if a fighter knows for sure or thinks it most likely that there will be fighting because he is facing the enemy, and he fears that fasting may make him weak when fighting, and he is not traveling, then he may break his fast before fighting. 
Compulsion 
Compulsion means one person forcing another to do something or not to do something against his will, by means of threats.
