37702,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/37702,Gathering to break the fast together,"Can we gather to break the fast together in the mosque in the month of Ramadaan, even if that is only on one day, for the purpose of strengthening the bonds and encouraging friendship among the people who attend the mosque? Or is that considered to be an innovation (bid’ah)?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.That is not considered to be bid’ah, rather that is one of the things that are prescribed in Islam because it is a means of achieving something that is prescribed, namely increasing love and friendship among the Muslims. 
Allaah reminded His Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) of the blessing of creating harmony among the believers, which indicates that this is one of the greatest blessings bestowed upon this ummah. 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“He it is Who has supported you with His Help and with the believers.
And He has united their (i.e. believers’) hearts. If you had spent all that is in the earth, you could not have united their hearts, but Allaah has united them. Certainly He is All-Mighty, All-Wise”
[al-Anfaal 8:62-63]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Be, O slaves of Allaah, brothers.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6064; Muslim, 2563. 
Increasing the love and friendship among the Muslims is one of the things encouraged by Islam, and it has prescribed the means of achieving that, such as giving the greeting of salaam, smiling at one’s fellow-Muslim, having a good attitude and giving gifts… and other things that are encouraged in Islam. 
Anything that is a means of achieving love amongst the Muslims and increasing it is something that is prescribed.

37706,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/37706,Does Wearing Perfume Break Your Fast?,Is it prescribed to put on perfume in Ramadan?,"Wearing perfume does not break your fast, but it is not permissible to inhale incense because incense contains particles which, if inhaled, may reach the stomach through the nose.",,"Praise be to Allah.It is permissible to wear perfume in Ramadan and that does not invalidate the fast. 
In Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah (Fatwas of the Standing Committee) it says: 
“All smells and fragrances in general, whether perfumes or otherwise, do not invalidate the fast in Ramadan or at other times, whether the fast is obligatory or voluntary.” 
The Committee also said: 
“Whoever puts on any kind of perfume during the day in Ramadan whilst fasting does not invalidate his fast, but he should not inhale incense or powdered fragrances such as musk.” (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 10/271) 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said: 
“With regard to perfume, it is permissible for the fasting person to put it on at the beginning of the day and at the end, whether the perfume is in the form of incense, oil or whatever, but it is not permissible to inhale incense because incense contains particles which, if inhaled, may reach the stomach through the nose . Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to Laqit ibn Sabrah: “Rinse your nose thoroughly, unless you are fasting.” (Fatawa Arkan al-Islam, p. 46)

It is preferable for the traveller to fast, so long as fasting does not cause him hardship, in which case it is better for him to break his fast and make up the days that he did not fast later on. See Question no. 20165. 
If you want to fast then you have to refrain from eating and drinking etc from dawn in the place where you are at the time of dawn, whether you are on the ground or in the air. 
Similarly the ruling concerning iftaar is that you should not break your fast until the sun sets in the place where you are. If you are on board the plane and you can see the sun, it is not permissible for you to break your fast until the sun sets, even if the sun has already set for the people of the land which you are flying over in the plane. 
The fact that the day may be made longer or shorter because of travelling does not have any effect on the fast. 
It is well known that if you are travelling eastwards, the day will become shorter for you, and if you are travelling westwards the day will become longer. 
What matters is the place where you are at the time of dawn and the time of sunset.

All they have to do is to make up the days they missed, whether they feared for themselves or their child.",Do pregnant women have to fast?,"Praise be to Allah.Do pregnant women have to fast?
The most correct view compares pregnant and nursing women to those who are sick. So it is permissible for pregnant women not to fast , and all they have to do is to make up for the days they missed , whether they feared for themselves or their child. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has relieved the traveller of the obligation of fasting and half of the prayer, and He has relieved the pregnant woman and nursing mother of the obligation of fasting.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 715; Ibn Majah, 1667; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi, 575) (For more, please see Seventy Issues related to Fasting. 
Fasting during pregnancy 
If a pregnant woman fears that fasting may harm her or her baby, then she should follow the ruling on one who is sick. So she may break her fast and she has to make up the days that she did not fast, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number [of days which one did not observe Sawm (fasts) must be made up] from other days.” [al-Baqarah 2:185]
But if she does not fear that she or her baby may be harmed by fasting, then she has to fast, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So whoever of you sights (the crescent on the first night of) the month (of Ramadan i.e. is present at his home), he must observe Sawm (fasts) that month.” [al-Baqarah 2:185]
In most cases, fasting is difficult for pregnant women, especially in the final months, and fasting may affect the pregnancy. So she should refer to a trustworthy doctor for advice. (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 6/359)

Charity during Ramadan is better than charity at other times, but we do not know of anything in the Sunnah to indicate that giving charity in the last ten days is better. 
But the scholars stated that righteous deeds are better when done at times of virtue, and undoubtedly the last ten nights of Ramadan are better than any other nights, because Laylat al-Qadr is among them, which is better than a thousand months. 
Whatever the case, what is prescribed for the Muslim is to give a great deal of charity throughout Ramadan. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was the most generous of people and he was at his most generous during Ramadan. Narrated by al-Bukhari, 6; Muslim, 2308

37729,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/37729,He is praying as an imam and he wants to delay Witr,I am inshaAllah going to be acting as imaam for a group in taraweeh. We shall pray eight rakahs and then three for witr. Is it true that my last action before sleeping should be the witr or is this merely recommended as a prudent course of action by the Prophet (saw). If I am intending to pray tahajjud later at night would it be better for me to delay my own witr until then and not pray witr with the jamaah or can I still lead them with me intending a nafal prayer of one rakat and the congregation intending that to be their witr?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.It is mustahabb for the last prayer that a Muslim prays at night to be Witr, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Make the last of your prayer at night Witr.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 998; Muslim, 751. 
This command from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is in the sense of it being mustahabb and preferable, not in the sense of it being obligatory and compulsory, because it was proven in Saheeh Muslim (738) from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to pray two rak’ahs after Witr whilst sitting down. 
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:  
The correct view is that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) performed these two rak’ahs after Witr sitting down, to demonstrate that it is permissible to pray after Witr, and to demonstrate that it is permissible to offer naafil prayers sitting down. He did not do that all the time, rather he did it once or twice or a few times. 
The well known regular Sunnah prayers mentioned in al-Saheehayn and elsewhere in reports from ‘Aa’ishah and from a number of the Sahaabah in al-Saheehayn state clearly that the last of the Prophet’s prayer at night was Witr. In al-Saheehayn there are many well-known ahaadeeth which enjoin making the last of one’s prayer at night Witr, such as “Make the last of your prayer at night Witr” and “Night prayers are two by two, and when you feel that dawn is approaching, pray one rak’ah”, etc. So how can anyone think, after reading these ahaadeeth and others, that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) regularly prayed two rak’ahs after Witr and made that the end of his night prayers? Rather what it means, as we have stated above, is that it is permissible to do so. This is the correct answer.  
Shaykh Ibn Baaz also said, explaining the reason why the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed two rak’ahs after Witr: 
The reason for that – and Allah knows best – is to show to the people that it is permissible to pray after Witr. Fataawa Islamiyyah, 1/339 
So if you want to pray Tahajjud at night, it is permissible for you to pray Witr with the congregation, then to pray after that as many rak’ahs as you want two by two, and do not repeat Witr. 
You also have the option of not praying Witr with the congregation, and delaying Witr so that it will be the last of your prayers at night. 
In this matter you have to pay attention to the congregation praying with you; if there is no one else but you to lead them in praying Witr, and if your not leading them in Witr will lead to them not praying Witr or not praying it properly, then you should pray Witr with them. 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz was asked: 
If I pray Witr at the beginning of the night then I get up at the end of the night, how should I pray? 
He replied: 
If you pray Witr at the beginning of the night then Allah enables you to pray qiyaam at the end of the night, then pray whatever Allah enables you to pray two by two, without Witr, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “There cannot be two Witrs in one night.” 
And it was narrated from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to pray two rak’ahs after Witr sitting down. Fataawa Islamiyyah, 1/339 
With regard to your saying that you will pray one rak’ah with them, intending that as a naafil prayer and not Witr, this is not an action that is prescribed in sharee’ah, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Night prayers are to be offered two by two.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 472; Muslim, 749. See al-Mughni, 2/539.

It was understood from this that naafil prayers should not be less than two rak’ahs, except Witr.

    steadfast in adhering to His religion and to cause her to die as a Muslim, and to keep her on the straight path. 
We advise our sister to avoid – as much as possible – places in which Allaah is 
    disobeyed. We understand from the question that she is studying in a mixed place, and living in a mixed hostel. This involves sin and danger to 
    her and to her religious commitment. Muslim sisters have to explain to her, in the best manner, the ruling on her situation and the dangers it 
    poses to her, and advise her that she should leave if possible, and so long as that will not put her in an even worse situation. 
Secondly: 
It is not permissible for you to take girls as friends, or for her to take men as 
    friends. Relationships between men and women are governed by Islamic sharee’ah, and sharee’ah does not give men and women the freedom to make 
    friends with one another, because that opens the door to a great deal of evil. This is one of the traps of the Shaytaan by means of which he 
    tricks people and makes them commit immoral actions such as shaking hands with them, being alone with them and things that are more serious than 
    that. 
Thirdly: 
With regard to her fasting: she has to fast and it is not permissible for her not 
    to fast. If she is among other students that is easier than if she was among her family and relatives. She can make the people think that she is 
    not fasting by carrying a glass of juice – for example – and let them think that she is drinking it, or she can say that she is sick and mean 
    thereby that she is sick at heart because of what people do, as Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) said: “I am sick” – or some other kind of 
    permissible trick. 
She has to fear Allaah and obey Him as much as she can, and whoever fears and

If a Muslim does not pray Tarawih , there is no sin on him for that, whether he has an excuse or not, because it is not obligatory.

Is it permissible to swallow the saliva after using the siwak?,"It is permissible to swallow the saliva after using the siwak while fasting, but if anything comes out of the siwak in the mouth, you should spit it out","Can we use siwak while fasting?


Can we swallow the saliva after using the siwak while fasting?","Praise be to Allah.Can we use siwak while fasting?
It is mustahabb to use the siwak at all times, when fasting and when not fasting, at the beginning of the day and at the end. The evidence for that is as follows: 

Al-Bukhari (887) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Were it not that it would cause hardship to my ummah, I would have commanded them to use the siwak for every prayer.” 
Al-Nasai narrated from ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The siwak purifies the mouth and is pleasing to the Lord.” Narrated by al-Nasai, 5; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Nasai, 5. 

These ahadith indicate that it is mustahabb to use the siwak at all times, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not make an exception in the case of one who is fasting, rather the general meaning of the hadith includes both those who are fasting and those who are not fasting.
Can we swallow the saliva after using the siwak while fasting?
It is permissible to swallow the saliva after using the siwak, but if anything comes out of the siwak in the mouth, you should spit it out and then swallow the saliva , just as the fasting person is allowed to do wudu, then he should spit out the water from his mouth and then swallow his saliva. He does not have to dry his mouth completely from the water used for rinsing.  
Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmu’ (6/327): 
“Al-Mutawalli and others said: When the fasting person rinses his mouth, he has to spit out the water; he does not have to dry out his mouth using a cloth or the like. There is no difference of scholarly opinion on this point.” 
Al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Chapter: Using fresh or dry siwak for one who is fasting … Abu Hurayrah said, narrating from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Were it not that it would cause hardship for my ummah, I would have commanded them to use the siwak for every wudu.” Al-Bukhari said:  There is no difference between one who is fasting and one who is not. ‘Aishah said, narrating from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “The siwak purifies the mouth and is pleasing to the Lord.” ‘Ata and Qatadah said: he may swallow his saliva.”
Al-Hafiz said in al-Fath: 
“By using this title, he refuted those who say that it is makruh for a fasting person to use a fresh siwak. This was preceded by Ibn Sirin’s likening the fresh siwak to the water used for rinsing the mouth (in wudu). 
“There is no difference between one who is fasting and one who is not” means also that there is no difference between fresh and dry. By stating this it becomes clear that everything narrated in this chapter fits the title. This is all summed up in the hadith of Abu Hurayrah, “Were it not that it would cause hardship for my ummah, I would have commanded them to use the siwak for every wudu.” This implies that it is permissible at all times and in all situations. 
“‘Ata and Qatadah said: he may swallow his saliva.” This comment suits the title in the sense that the worst thing that may be feared from using a wet siwak is that something may come out of it in the mouth. This is like the water used for rinsing the mouth; if the person spits it out from his mouth, it does not matter after that if he swallows his saliva.” 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said: 
“The correct view is that the use of the siwak by one who is fasting is Sunnah at the beginning and at the end of the day. (Fatawa Arkan al-Islam, p. 468)
The siwak is Sunnah for one who is fasting throughout the day, even if it is fresh. If a person uses the siwak whilst fasting and finds that he can taste it, and he swallows it or spits it out from his mouth and there is saliva on it, then he swallows it, that does not affect him. (Al-Fatawa al-Sa’diyyah, 245) 
He should avoid that which contains something that could come out of it, such as the fresh siwak and those which have added flavours that come out, such as lemon and mint. He should spit out anything that breaks off in the mouth, and it is not permissible to swallow it deliberately, but if he swallows it accidentally it does not matter.” (Sab’una Masalah fi’l-Siyam (Seventy Issues Related to Fasting)

It is haraam for you to have a boyfriend, and it is haraam for both of you to shake hands or to be alone together, let alone hugging, kissing and touching. All of that comes under the heading of zina al-jawaarih (fornication of the limbs). It is haraam at times other than Ramadaan, and during Ramadaan the prohibition is even stronger because of the sanctity of the month, whether it is done at night or during the day. 
The words of Allaah: 
“It is made lawful for you to have sexual relations with your wives on the night of As-Sawm (the fasts)”
[al-Baqarah 2:197 – interpretation of the meaning]
 are addressed only to those who are married. 
This boyfriend has to repent to Allaah for doing this with you, and you have to repent to Allaah. Then after that it is permissible for you to get married. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “I do not think there is anything better for two who love one another than marriage.” This hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan Ibn Maajah.

Is ghusl fard on us or not? Please tell me because I pass this thing a lot and find it on my underwear and I do ghusl 2 or 3 times a day to make my fast and prayer valid. Please tell me what this is and what I should do.,"There is no need to do ghusl because of this discharge, and it does not affect the fast. With regard to prayer, wudu must be done for each prayer after the time for the prayer has begun, if the flow is continual.",,"Praise be to Allah.This kind of discharge is passed a great deal by women. It is pure and not impure, and there is no need to do ghusl because of it. All it does is invalidate wudu . 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about it and he replied: 
“After researching the matter, it seems to me that the discharge that is passed by women, if it does not come from the bladder but rather from the womb, then it is pure. 
This is the ruling on this discharge with regard to purity. It is pure and does not make the clothes or the body impure. 
With regard to wudu, the ruling is that it invalidates wudu , unless it is continual , in which case it does not invalidate wudu, but the woman should not do wudu for each prayer until after the time for the prayer has begun, and she has to use a pad. 
But if it starts and stops, and it usually stops at the time of prayer, then she should delay the prayer until the time when it stops, so long as there is no fear that the time for prayer will end. If she fears that she will miss the prayer, then she should do wudu, use a pad and pray. It makes no difference if there is a little or a lot, because it is all coming from the front passage so a little or a lot invalidates wudu.”  ( Majmu’ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 11/284)
Using a pad means placing a piece of rag or cotton etc., in the vagina so that less of this discharge will come out, and to prevent it getting on to the clothes or body. 
Based on this, there is no need to do ghusl because of this discharge, and it does not affect the fast. With regard to prayer, wudu must be done for each prayer after the time for the prayer has begun, if the flow is continual.

May Allaah reward you with all good on my behalf and on behalf of the Muslims.",,,"Praise be to Allah.With regard to the first part of your question, please see the section on 
    Taraaweeh prayer and Laylat al-Qadr under the heading of 
    Fasting on this website. 
With regard to communal du’aa’ after Taraaweeh prayer, this action is an 
    innovation (bid’ah). The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Whoever does an action that is not part of this matter of 
    ours (Islam), will have it rejected.” Narrated by Muslim, 3243. 
What was narrated from the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) was that after Taraaweeh prayer he would say, “Subhaan al-Malik al-Quddoos (Glory be to the Sovereign, the Most Holy)”, three times, 
    raising his voice on the third time. 
Ahmad (14929), Abu Dawood (1430) and al-Nasaa’i (1699) narrated that Ubayy ibn 
    Ka’b (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to recite in Witr “Sabbih 
    isma Rabbika al-A’la (Glorify the name of your Lord, the Most High)…” [i.e., Soorat al-A’laa 87] and Qul yaa ayyuha’l-kaafiroon (Say (O 
    Muhammad), ‘O al-Kaafiroon (disbelievers))…’” [i.e., Soorat al-Kaafiroon 109] and “Qul Huwa Allaahu ahad (Say (O Muhammad), ‘He is Allaah, 
    (the) One)…” [i.e., Soorat al-Ikhlaas 112]. And after he said the tasleem he would say “Subhaan al-Malik al-Quddoos, Subhaan al-Malik 
    al-Quddoos, Subhaan al-Malik al-Quddoos (Glory be to the Sovereign, the Most Holy; Glory be to the Sovereign, the Most Holy; Glory be to the 
    Sovereign, the Most Holy)”, raising his voice. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Nasaa’i, 1653. 
Then in Witr prayer the imam will recite du’aa al-qunoot and the worshippers will 
    say Ameen behind him, as Ubayy ibn Ka’b (may Allaah be pleased with him) used to do when he led the people in praying Taraaweeh at the time of 
    ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him). So there is no need to introduce this bid’ah. How true are the words of the one who said, “All goodness is 
    in following those who came before, and all evil is in the innovation of those who came later.”

I heard that this was the kind of fast observed by the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). I hope that you can tell me what continual fasting means.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Fasting continually means that a person fasts for two or more days without breaking the fast, i.e., the fast continues all night and the person does not eat or drink. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to fast continually, and Allaah gave him the strength to do that, but he forbade his ummah to do that out of compassion and mercy towards them. 
Al-Bukhaari (7299) and Muslim (1103) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Do not fast continually.” They said, “But you fast continually.” He said, “I am not like you. I spend my time with my Lord and He gives me food and drink.” They did not stop fasting continually, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) fasted continually with them for two or three days, then they saw the new moon, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If the new moon had come later I would have continued my fast” – as if to prove to them that they were not like him and could not continue fasting. 
Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni, 4/436: Continual fasting is makrooh according to the majority of scholars. 
Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmoo’, 6/357: 
With regard to the ruling on continual fasting, it is makrooh, and there is no difference of opinion among us concerning that. But is it makrooh in the sense of being forbidden or makrooh in the sense of being disliked? There are two opinions concerning that … (the more correct of which) according to our companions and the apparent meaning of the statement of al-Shaafa’i is that it is makrooh in the sense of being forbidden.

You have to refer to a trustworthy doctor . If the sickness from which you are suffering is one from which there is the hope of recovery, then after you recover you have to make up the fasts that you missed during this Ramadan and the previous Ramadan, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number [of days which one did not observe fasts must be made up] from other days.” [Al-Baqarah 2:185]
But if the sickness is permanent and there is no hope of recovery, then you have to feed one poor person for each day that you did not fast in this Ramadan and in the previous one, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And as for those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g. an old man), they have (a choice either to fast or) to feed a poor person (for every day).” [Al-Baqarah 2:184]
Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: This refers to the old man or old woman who cannot fast , so for each day they should feed one poor person. (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 4505). The sick person who has no hope of recovery comes under the same ruling as the elderly.
Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Mughni, 4/396:

“The time of Tarawih prayer begins when the ‘Isha prayer is over, as was stated by al-Baghawi and others, and it lasts until dawn comes.” 
But if a man is going to pray in the mosque as an imam leading the people in prayer, it is better to pray Tarawih after `Isha prayer and not to delay it until the middle or the end of the night, so that this will not cause hardship for the worshippers and some of them may sleep and miss the prayer. This is what the Muslims usually do, they pray Tarawih after `Isha and do not delay it.

When to resume prayer and fasting after abortion","Praise be to Allah.When is the bleeding following an abortion regarded as Nifas?
It is not permissible for a woman who is bleeding following childbirth to fast , and her fast is not valid. She has to make up the days that she missed because of Nifas (postpartum bleeding). 
Nifas is the blood passed by a woman because of childbirth. 
But if a woman miscarries (or has an abortion), the blood that she passes is not considered to be Nifas unless the foetus has human features. 
Human features do not appear in the foetus before eighty days of pregnancy, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The creation of any one of you is put together in his mother’s womb for forty days, then he becomes a `Alaqah (a piece of thick coagulated blood) for a similar period, then he becomes like a chewed piece of flesh for a similar period, then Allah sends an angel who is enjoined to write down four things, and it is said to him: `Write down his deeds, his provision, his lifespan and whether he is doomed for Hell or destined for Paradise. Then the soul is breathed into him.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 3208)
This Hadith indicates that a human being goes through a number of stages during pregnancy. 
For forty days he is a Nutfah (mixed drops of male and female sexual discharge), for the next forty days he is a `Alaqah (a piece of thick coagulated blood), then for forty days he is a Mudghah (a lump of chewed flesh), then the soul is breathed into him after one hundred and twenty days have passed.  
Human features begin to appear at the Mudghah stage, not before that, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O mankind! If you are in doubt about the Resurrection, then verily, We have created you (i.e. Adam) from dust, then from a Nutfah (mixed drops of male and female sexual discharge, i.e. the offspring of Adam), then from a clot (a piece of thick coagulated blood) then from a little lump of flesh — some formed and some unformed (as in the case of miscarriage) — that We may make (it) clear to you (i.e. to show you Our Power and Ability to do what We will).” [Al-Hajj 22:5]
Allah described the Mudghah as being formed and unformed.  What is meant by formed is that there appears on the embryo traces of how the body will look, such as the head, limbs, etc.  
When to resume prayer and fasting after abortion
If this woman had an abortion, if that happened before eighty days of pregnancy, then the blood she passes is not the blood of Nifas, rather it is Istihadah (non-menstrual bleeding) which does not stop her from praying and fasting, but she has to do Wudu for each prayer. 
If the abortion took place after the soul was breathed into the foetus – i.e., after one hundred and twenty days of pregnancy – then the blood is definitely Nifas. 
If the abortion took place between eighty and one hundred and twenty days, then the embryo should be examined. If it has human features then the blood is Nifas, and if it does not then the blood is Istihadah . 
Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his essay Ad-Dima’ At-Tabi`iyyah lin-Nisa’ (The Natural Blood of Women), p. 40: 
“Nifas is not established unless the embryo expelled has human features. If she expels a small embryo that has no human features then her bleeding is not Nifas, rather it is bleeding from a vein, so it comes under the same ruling as Istihadah. The earliest at which human features may appear is eighty days from the beginning of pregnancy, but it usually happens at ninety days.” 
The woman in Nifas has to stop praying and fasting until she becomes pure. When the bleeding stops and she becomes pure, she should do Ghusl and pray and fast. If the bleeding lasts for more than forty days , if the additional bleeding coincides with her usual menstrual cycle then it is Hayd (menstruation); if it does not coincide with her usual cycle then it is Istihadah, so she should do Ghusl and pray and fast, and do everything that women who are pure do.

Dawn is called the white thread because the first thing that is seen of the dawn
