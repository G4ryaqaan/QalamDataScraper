There is nothing wrong with finding out the sex of the baby before its birth unless it involves great expense. 
It could be said that it is a waste of money because there is no need to know the sex of the baby except for the purposes of merely feeling happy because one knows whether it is a boy or a girl. 
If finding out the sex of the baby in the mother's womb before its birth could not be achieved without spending a lot of money, then it is a waste of money and is not permitted.

    punishment, or get his hand cut off, will he then get a punishment for that sin in the
    Hereafter? If he is homosexual and gets stoned to death, is he then free from the fire of
    hell?
Could you please tell me the answer in light of Hadeeth and Quran ?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) narrated in
    his Saheeh (3/143, no. 3679) with his isnaad that ‘Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit, one
    of those who was present at Badr with the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him), said that one of those who had been present at al-‘Aqabah told
    him:
The Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)
    said, with a group of his Sahaabah standing around him: “Come and give me your oath
    of allegiance, promising that you will not associate anything in worship with Allaah, or
    steal, or commit zinaa (illegal sexual activity), or kill your children, or utter slander
    intentionally forging falsehood (by wrongfully attributing illegitimate children to
    husbands) [cf 60:12], or disobey me with regard to anything good (ma’roof). Whoever
    among you fulfils this oath, his reward will be due from Allaah, and whoever commits any
    of these sins and is punished for it in this world, this will be an expiation for him.
    Whoever commits any of these sins and Allaah conceals it for him, then his case rests with
    Allaah – if He wills, He will punish him and if He wills, He will forgive him.”
    So they gave their oath of allegiance to him on that basis.
Al-Haafiz said in al-Fath (1/6): “What we learn from this
    hadeeth is that the carrying out of the punishment is an expiation for the sin, even if
    the one on whom the hadd is carried out does not repent. This is the view of the
    majority. It was also said that he has to repent – this was stated by some of the
    Taabi’een.”
The previous hadeeth was also narrated by al-Tirmidhi in his Sunan.
    After quoting it, he said:
“Al-Shaafa’i said concerning this topic: I have not heard any
    better indication than this hadeeth to show that the hudood (punishments) are an
    expiation for the people on whom they are carried out. Al-Shaafa’i said: if a person
    commits a sin and Allaah conceals it for him, I prefer for him to keep it concealed and to
    repent, keeping the matter between himself and Allaah. Something similar was narrated from
    Abu Bakr and ‘Umar, that they commanded a man to conceal his sin.” (Sunan
    al-Tirmidhi, 1439). So there is no need for the person who commits a
    punishable sin to go to the Qaadi (judge) and confess and ask for the hadd to be
    carried out on him; rather, he is encouraged to keep it to himself and to repent, keeping
    the matter between himself and Allaah, may He be glorified, and to do lots of righteous
    deeds, for good deeds cancel out bad deeds, and the one who repents from sin is like one
    who did not sin at all. We ask Allaah to keep us safe and to forgive us. May Allaah bless
    our Prophet Muhammad.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

      converted to islam from Hinduism myself. Wondering, if it is okay to try my best to not
      have children with this christian wife since there is no agreement on raising the child as

    for the blessing that Allaah has bestowed upon you by bringing you into Islam. We ask
    Allaah to help you to be steadfast in Islam and to die as a Muslim.
Secondly, we do not advise you to prevent having children with your
    Christian wife, for two reasons:
Having a lot of children is required according to sharee’ah. The
        Messenger 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Marry women who are
        loving and fertile, for I will be proud of your great number before the other nations on
        the Day of Resurrection.” (narrated by Abu Dawood, 1754; al-Nisaa’i, 3175;
        classed as saheeh by al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) in Adaab al-Zafaaf,
        p. 132)

It is not definite that your wife will remain a non-Muslim. Allaah may
        bless her with Islam as He has blessed you, then you may regret having gotten older
        without having children to bring up in the right religion and with proper manners.

So we advise you not to prevent having children, and to try to call your
    wife to Islam – maybe Allaah will bless her with Islam.
If Allaah does bless you with children, then you have to bring them up in
    the right religion and with proper manners from an early age. This is one of the duties
    that Allaah requires of you, and your non-Muslim wife has no say in the matter. Allaah
    says (interpretation of the meaning):
“O you who believe! Ward off from yourselves and your families a
    Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones” [al-Tahreem 6:66]. 
The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Each
    of you is a shepherd, and each of you is responsible for his flock… a man is a
    shepherd of his family and will be asked about those who are under his care…”

    stand shoulder to shoulder and foot to foot.
Al-Bukhaari, may Allaah have mercy on him, narrated (683)
    from Anas that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)

Al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) gave this
    chapter the title: “Chapter on standing shoulder to shoulder and foot to
    foot.”
He said: al-Nu’maan ibn Basheer said: “I saw people
    standing with their ankles against their neighbours’ ankle.”
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeem al-Abaadi said: he said in al-Ta’leeq
    al-Mughni: These ahaadeeth clearly indicate the importance of making the
    rows straight, which is part of the perfection of prayer; they indicate that
    people should not stand back (from the row) or in front of (the row), and
    that they should stand shoulder to shoulder, foot to foot and knee to knee
    with their neighbours. But nowadays this Sunnah is being ignored! If someone
    does this nowadays the people shy away from him like zebras! Verily to
    Allaah we belong and unto Him is our return.

6239,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6239,Naming    a boy Abu Bakr,"We are expecting our first baby. Al-HamduAllah. My husband is Arab. I am American. If we are given a boy, my husband wishes to name him Abu Bakr. I feel that this is a most beautiful name. However, I am not well versed in Arabic. It has been my understanding that the word Abu refers to ""Father Of"" for example: Abu Nuh, Father of Nuh. If we are to name our child Abu Bakr, Would this mean that he is the ""Father of Bakr?"" Did this most wonderful companion of the Prophet (PBUH) go by any other names? I have her the name Siddiq. Are there others. Is this name appropriate for a child? Please forgive my ignorance. Also, the sound of the name may play some part with me as I am American. This can be overcome however. I only wish to do what is pleasing to Allah (SWT) and His Messenger. Also, I wish to please my husband and not cause him trouble with this.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The full name of Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq (may Allah be pleased with him) was ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Uthmaan ibn ‘Amr al-Qurashi. His father’s kunyah was Abu Quhaafah.
The kunyah is a nickname which starts with Abu (father of) or Umm (mother of). It usually includes the name of the oldest son. It may also be just a nickname, as in the example given in the question, since Abu Bakr did not have any child whose name was Bakr. The nickname may be given because of something that is unique to that person, such as Abu Hurayrah (lit. father of the kitten). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) gave him this nickname because he would often carry a cat or kitten with him.
Another example is the nickname Abu Turaab (father of dust) which was the kunyah of ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) gave him this nickname when he saw him with dust on his back and shoulders.
Therefore there is no reason why you cannot give your child the nickname of Abu Bakr, not as a name.
It is well known that Abu Bakr’s real name was ‘Abd-Allah. Although it was reported that his name was ‘Ateeq, the correct view is that this was one of his attributes (‘Ateeq = freed, i.e., from the Fire). (Al-‘Istee’aab by Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr, 8/963; al-Isaabah, 4/170-171).
Among his children were: ‘Abd-Allah, ‘Abd al-Rahmaan, Muhammad, ‘Aa’ishah, Asmaa’ and Umm kalthoom.
If you were to name your son ‘Abd-Allah – because this is the most beloved of names to Allah – and give him the nickname of Abu Bakr because it is Sunnah to give young children such nicknames in order to make them feel grown up and responsible, this would be an ideal solution. May Allah help us and you to do all that is good.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

      iddah following her husbands death has to stay in her house. There are two
      views, the more famous and stronger of which is that she has to stay in the marital home.
      This is the view of the majority of scholars, including the four imaams.
They used as their evidence for this ruling the Sunnah as
      narrated in the Hadeeth of Fareeah bint Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with her) who
      said that she came to the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and
      asked him whether she could go back to her family of Banu Khudrah. Her husband had set out
      in pursuit of some slaves of his who had run away, and when he caught up with them at the
      edge of al-Qadoom they had killed him. She asked the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and
      blessings of Allaah be upon him) to let her go back to her family because her husband had
      not left her in a house that he owned. She narrated: The Messenger of Allaah 
      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said Yes, so I walked away until I
      was by the apartment, or in the mosque, then he called me  or commanded me 
      and I came back. I told him the story again about what had happened to my husband, and he
      said, Stay in your house until the appointed time [i.e., until your iddah is
      over]. She said: So I spent my iddah there, four months and ten
      days. When Uthmaan was the khaleefah, he sent word to me and asked me about that, so
      I told him and he followed it and ruled in accordance with it.
It was narrated by Abu Dawood, al-Nisaai, al-Tirmidhi and Ibn
      Maajah, and classed as saheeh by al-Tirmidhi, Ibn Hibbaan, al-Haakim, al-Dhahabi, Ibn
      al-Qayyim and others.
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:
There is no reason to reject this clear saheeh Sunnah which
      Uthmaan ibn Affaan and other great Sahaabah accepted. (Zaad
      al-Zaaad, 5/691)
Note:
A woman who is in iddah could be faced with an emergency such as the
      fear of the house collapsing, a flood or an enemy, or she could feel lonely, or she may be
      living among immoral people, or the heirs may want to make her leave the house, or by
      staying she may lose her children or wealth etc. In such cases it is permissible for
      her to move wherever she wishes, and she does not have to move to the nearest place. This
      is the view of the majority of scholars among the Hanafis, Hanbalis and Maalikis.
This is on the condition that she can still adhere to the rulings of
      iddah in the new home as she did in the previous home.
If a woman is able to manage her affairs from the marital home, she has no
      reason to move. For example, she can delegate a trustworthy person to follow up the
      inheritance or property. If your mother is able to do her iddah in the house in
      which she was living with her husband when he died, then she should stay there. And Allaah

6241,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6241,Changing Surname after Marriage in Islam,"I have read your responses to the following questions 2537 and 4362 concerning a wife retaining her father's name upon marriage. The verses mentioned from Surat Al-Ahzab states that adopted sons (and hence daughters) should not be called as sons of the step-fathers. 
However, how exactly does this apply to a wife simply changing her name for marriage; as she is not actually claiming to belong to her husband, but just taking his name? If it is a question of lineage, I would appreciate specific references from the Quran and hadith.","There is no blood tie between the husband and wife, so changing the surname after marriage in Islam is not allowed. She may get divorced, or her husband may die, and she may marry another man. Will she keep changing her surname every time she marries another man?","Effects of imitating the West in naming


Changing surname after marriage","Praise be to Allah.Effects of imitating the West in naming
The effects of imitating the West in naming ourselves are many. One of them is the way in which people have got used to omitting the word ibn (son of) or ibnatu (daughter of) between their own names and the name of their fathers. 
The reason for this is, firstly, because some families have adopted children and given them their surname, so that the adopted child is called Fulan Fulan [where Fulan (=So and So) stands for a name] and their real children are called Fulan ibn Fulan (So and So the son of So and So). 
Now in the fourteenth century AH, people have dropped the word ibn or ibnatu which is unacceptable according to linguistics, custom and Shari`ah. May Allah help us.
Another effect is the habit of women taking their husband’s surnames.
Originally, the woman is So and So the Daughter of So and So, not So and So the wife of So and So! Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Call them (adopted sons) by (the names of) their fathers, that is more just with Allah.” [Al-Ahzab 33:5]
As it is in this world, so it will also be in the Hereafter, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:
“On the Day of Resurrection, each betrayer will have a banner raised beside him, and it will be said, this is the betrayer of So and So the son of So and So.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5709, and Muslim, 3265)
Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“This is one of the beauties of Shari`ah, because calling a person by his father’s name is more appropriate for knowing who is who and telling people apart. The father is the protector and maintainer of the child and his mother both inside and outside the home. This is why the father mixes with people in the marketplaces and takes risks by travelling to earn a halal living and strive for their sakes. So the child is given the name of the father, not of the mother who is hidden away and who is one of those whom Allah commanded (interpretation of the meaning):
And stay in your houses [al-Ahzab 33:33] (Tasmiyat al-Mawlud, 30, 31)
Changing surname after marriage
On the basis of the above, there is no blood tie between the husband and wife, so how can she take his surname as if she is part of the same lineage?
Moreover, she may get divorced, or her husband may die, and she may marry another man. Will she keep changing her surname every time she marries another man? Furthermore, there are rulings attached to her being named after her father, which have to do with inheritance, spending and who is a mahram, etc. Taking her husband’s surname overlooks all that. The husband is named after his own father, and what does she have to do with the lineage of her husband’s father? This goes against common sense and true facts. The husband has nothing that makes him better than his wife so that she should take his surname, whilst he takes his father’s name.
Hence everyone who has gone against this and taken her husband’s name should put matters right. We ask Allah to put all the affairs of the Muslims right.

6244,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6244,Why Do Women Cover Their Hair?,Why do Muslim women cover their hair and what happens if they do or if they don’t?,Muslim women cover their hair because Allah has commanded them to do so because there is great wisdom in it. Hijab protects a woman’s honor from the “human wolves” who are looking for easy prey to attack and devour. See the detailed answer for more about why women cover their hair.,,"Praise be to Allah.Muslim women cover their hair because Allah has commanded them to do so, and it is not permissible for them to go against what He says and disobey His command. Allah has only commanded them to do this because there is great wisdom in it. 
Part of that wisdom is that it protects a woman’s honour from the “human wolves” who are looking for easy prey to attack and devour, and a morsel cannot be eaten unless it is prepared and ready – which is what we see in those woman who make a display of themselves, who by their appearance are calling those wolves to come and take whatever they want!
Confirmation of this is to be found in the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning):
“… That will be better, that they should be known (as free respectable women) so as not to be annoyed…” [al-Ahzab 33:59]. 
If a woman covers herself , then immoral and corrupt men will know that this is not part of their prey, thus Allah will protect them and take care of them.
Allah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) have issued a stern warning to women who make a display of themselves. An example of this is:
Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There are two types of the people of Hell whom I have not seen: a people with whips like the tails of cattle, with which they beat the people, and women who are clothed but naked, walking with an enticing gait and with their heads looking like the humps of camels, leaning to one side. They will not enter Paradise and will not even smell its fragrance, although its fragrance can be detected from such and such a distance.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2128).
A woman [or a man] should not try to comprehend Islamic rulings with her reason – which is unable to encompass the wisdom of Shari’ah. She should know that whatever Allah has enjoined upon her contains nothing but goodness and happiness for her, her family and society as a whole. 
It is known that a woman’s uncovering her hair makes her more attractive to men, which could lead to them forming hopes about her and committing immoral actions. 
Islam wants society to be clean, with no provocation of desires, outrage or uncovering of women’s charms – which include their hair – which can lead to others being tempted by her and which opens the door to evil and its people.
We need to point out again that Islam means submitting to Allah. The believer follows the command of Allah even if he does not know the wisdom behind it or he does not find anything to convince his reason for it, because his obedience of his Lord and his submission to His command take priority over all other things, and worship is based on obedience and submission.
We ask Allah to show us the truth and help us to follow it, and to show us falsehood and help us to avoid it.

If you would be so kind, I would like to ask you a question about Islam. I have heard that Islam says that if one does not marry, one cannot get into heaven. Is this true? If so, what is the basis? I would suppose that the reasons would be the propagation of humankind and to avoid promiscuity. The former of these seems to be common to other religions, but I am curious about the latter.

Usually no one forgoes getting married except one who is either impotent or promiscuous, as ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allah be pleased with him) said to a man who had not got married: “Nothing is keeping you from getting married except either impotence or immorality.”
In any case, Islam urges people to get married and considers marriage to be one of the ways of the Messengers; it is forbidden to forego getting married even if the intention is to devote oneself to worship. “There is no monasticism in Islam.”

He has also started to be so suspicious of me, that he has left his work to stay home so he can watch over me. What should I do?",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to stay with a husband who is like this, because by neglecting the salaah (prayer) he is a kaafir, and it is not permissible for a Muslim woman to marry a kaafir or stay with him.

“… if you ascertain that they [women] are true believers, send them not back to the disbelievers, they are not lawful (wives) for the disbelievers nor are the disbelievers lawful (husbands) for them…” [al-Mumtahinah 60:10]
The marriage between you and him is null and void, and there can be no nikaah (marriage) between you unless Allaah guides him and he repents to Allaah and comes back to Islam. In that case the marriage will remain valid. The husband’s conduct is not correct, and it seems to me that he is suffering from some kind of (mental) illness, namely paranoia and waswaas (insinuating whispers of the Shaytaan) from which some people suffer with regard to their worship and their dealings with others. Nothing will get rid of this sickness but remembering Allaah (dhikr), seeking refuge in Him and putting one’s trust in Him to get rid of it.

If this is not o.k. then what should a person who has done so (out of ignorance) do now?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: It is not permissible for a man to swear against himself and invoke the curse or wrath of Allaah upon himself, or swear an oath by saying that he will be a kaafir or beyond the pale of Islam or he will be an apostate and so on. The evidence for that is as follows: 
1 – The verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And were Allaah to hasten for mankind the evil (they invoke for themselves and for their children, while in a state of anger) as He hastens for them the good (they invoke) then they would have been ruined”
[Yoonus 10:11]
al-Qurtubi said: 
Mujaahid said: This was revealed concerning a man who prayed against himself, his wealth or his children when he got angry, saying, “O Allaah, destroy it, O Allaah, do not bless it and curse it” etc. If that were to be responded to as prayers for good were responded to, then they would have been ruined. So this verse was revealed to criticize this bad characteristic that exists in some people who pray for good and want a quick response, then sometimes their bad attitude makes them pray for bad things, but if those prayers were to be answered quickly they would be ruined. 
Tafseer al-Qurtubi, 8/315. 
2 – It was narrated from Thaabit al-Dahhaak (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever swears an oath by saying that he will belong to a religion other than Islam, then he is as he said.”  Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5700.
3 – The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) heard a man cursing his camel when it walked too slowly. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Who is cursing his camel?” He said: “It is me, O Messenger of Allaah.” He said: “Get down from it, for we do not want to be accompanied by something that is cursed. And do not pray against yourselves or against your children, and do not pray against your wealth, lest you say such a thing and it coincides with a time when Allaah answers prayers and responds to what you ask for.” Narrated by Muslim, 3014. 
Secondly:  With regard to what the one who has said such a thing should do, there is a difference of opinion among the scholars. Some of them are of the view that he has to offer expiation, and others are of the view that he does not have to offer expiation.
In al-Musannaf, ‘Abd al-Razzaaq narrated some reports that were transmitted from the salaf concerning that: 
It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas concerning a man who swore that he would be a Jew or a Christian or a Magian or out of Islam or that the curse of Allaah would be upon him or that he would be obliged to do something, that this was a binding oath. (15974). 
It was narrated that Tawoos said: “Whoever says ‘I am a kaafir’ or ‘I am a Jew or a Christian or a Magian’ or ‘May Allaah humiliate me’ and the like (if I do such and such), this is an oath (yameen) for which he must offer expiation.” (10975). 
It was narrated that Ibn Jurayj said: I heard a person say to ‘Ata’: “If a man says, May the wrath of Allaah be upon me, or May Allaah humiliate me or I pray to Allaah against myself or …, will that put him beyond the pale of Islam?” He said: “I would rather that he carried out what he resolved to do. If he did not carry out what he resolved to do, then he does not have to do anything because it is not an oath.” (15977). 
It was narrated that Ibn Jurayj said: I heard ‘Ata’ being asked about a man who says: “I give my promise and covenant to Allaah,” then he broke his word; was that an oath (yameen)? He said: “No, unless he intended it as an oath or he said, May Allaah humiliate me, or may the curse of Allaah be upon me, or he said I will associate someone else with Allaah or I will disbelieve in Allaah and so on. He said: No (meaning, it is not an oath), unless he swore by Allaah.” (15978). 
Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said that it is more likely that he does not have to offer expiation because there is no evidence to suggest that offering expiation in this case is obligatory.  See al-Mughni, 13/465. 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Jibreen (may Allaah preserve him) was asked about this matter and he said: This is not an oath (yameen) and no expiation is required, but he has to repent to Allaah from that. 
If the Muslim wants to be more on the safe side and offer kafaarat yameen (expiation for breaking an oath), that is fine.

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Yes, O slaves of Allah, seek cures for sickness, for Allah does not create any disease but He also creates the cure for it – or medicine for it – except for one disease.” They said, “O Messenger of Allah, what is that?” He said, “Old age.”

There are certain conditions attached to treatment and the giving of medicine, as follows:

It should not lead to a greater harm, such as a more severe sickness or death; some of the treatments for impotence may do this.
It should not use anything that is haraam, such as wine, impure substances (najaasah) or meat which we are not permitted to eat.

        warnings in the pure shareeah addressed to those who uuter curses. For example:

The groom can wear any kind of clothing that has been

It is not permitted for the couple to exchange rings,

It is not permissible for men and women to mix, at weddings

      what these have been and why they have emerged. How is it that despite the
      differences in Islam, it has been possible for Muslims of different
      persuasions to feel a sense of unity?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Know, may Allaah guide us and you to the truth and
      enable us to follow it, that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of
      Allaah be upon him) did not die before he had shown the way clearly to his
      ummah [nation]. There was no
      major or minor matter but he gave us knowledge about it from Allaah. At
      the end of the last Hajj [pilgrimage] performed by the Prophet 
 (peace
      and blessings of Allaah be upon him) there was revealed the aayah
      [verse] (interpretation of the meaning):
      
      
 “This
      day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you,
      and have chosen for you Islâm as your religion” [al-Maa’idah 5:3]
      
      
 The
      Sahaabah [Companions of the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be
      upon him] (may Allaah be pleased with them) adhered very closely to this
      path, and thus Allaah protected the followers of Islam from splitting in
      this blameworthy manner.
      
      
 They were
      followed in that by the Taabi’een [the generation that followed the
      generation of the Sahaabah] (may Allaah have mercy on them), but some
      internal and external factors led to the emergence of some reprehensible
      divisions following the three best generations. Among the external causes
      of that were:
      
      
Mixing with
      other, non-Muslim nations, such as the Persians, Romans, Indians and
      Greeks, and contact with other religious groups such as Jews, Christians,
      Sabians, Magians, Indian religions and others.
      
      
Among the
      internal causes were:
      
      
Following whims
      and desires, giving room to doubts, turning away from learning the
      religion and sharee’ah of Allaah, ignorance, extremism, and imitation of
      non-Muslims… etc.
      
      
 All of
      these reasons, and others, led to some small groups splitting from the
      right path which the majority of the Muslims followed, so there emerged
      some groups, innovations and opinions that differed from the path of the
      Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his
      Companions, and the Taabi’een and those who followed their path.
      
      
 But we
      may note that these groups and factions were in fact a discordant note
      that differed from the majority of Muslims, and their followers were
      shunned and opposed by the scholars, khulafaa’ [khaleefahs or Muslim
      rulers] and majority of Muslims, which meant that they were contained and
      their influence was prevented from becoming widespread during most periods
      of Islamic history.
 The
      majority of Muslims remained on the Sunni path – in general – and when
      forms of bid’ah emerged among them, the scholars of truth have always
      hastened to oppose them and point out their falsehood. Our Prophet
      Muhammad 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us that
      these divisions would emerge; he warned us about them and commanded us to
      adhere to the jamaa’ah
      [main body] of the Muslims. He said: “The Jews and the Christians split
      into seventy-two sects, all of which are in Hell; this ummah [nation] will split into seventy-three sects, all of
      which will be in Hell apart from one.” They asked, “Which one is that,
      O Messenger of Allaah?” He said, “Those who follow the path which I
      and my Companions are on today.”He
      said,“A group of my ummah will remain following the truth and will prevail, and
      those who oppose them will not harm them, until the Day of Judgement
      begins.” 
      
      
 There are
      many reasons why the Muslims have always felt a sense of unity, some of
      which we have mentioned above. But the most obvious reason is that this
      religion comes from Allaah and it is protected by Allaah. If any other
      religion had been exposed to the wars, conspiracies and plots that Islam
      has been exposed to, it would have vanished a long time ago (as we see in
      the case of other religions). Every rational person will see that a belief
      which for more than 1400 years has stayed exactly the same as it was at
      the time of the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him),
      and is still renewing itself in the hearts of its followers (in love and
      adherence) like the renweing of a flower in spring – this is the

Their claim that their orientation is natural serves only to propagate and spread immorality, and it is just an excuse for them. Many of them change their appearance so as to look odd, so how can we say that this is how they were created?
Allaah does not create anyone just to punish or torture them. He created mankind to worship Him, but He may try His slaves with hardship as a test of their faith, to expiate for their sins and to raise their status.

Is it okay for me to opt to pray alone, even when there is a jemaah waiting or in progress?",,,"Praise be to Allah.What you have mentioned, that you feel khushoo’ when you pray on your own but not when you pray in jamaa’ah, is the temptation of the Shaytaan which we are told not to fall prey to. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“and follow not the footsteps of Shaytaan (Satan). Verily, he is to you an open enemy” [al-Baqarah 2:168]
 Prayer in jamaa’ah is obligatory and the Shaytaan wants to distract you from fulfilling this obligation by making you doubt about your khushoo’. He makes the idea of praying alone so that you can have more khushoo’ appear attractive, but in fact he wants to keep you away from the house of Allaah and from the jamaa’ah of your Muslim brothers who pray in the mosque, so that you will be alone. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) explained that the Shaytaan has control over those who neglect praying in congregation. According to a hasan hadeeth narrated by Abu Dawood (may Allaah have mercy on him), Abu’l-Dardaa said: “I heard the  Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say, ‘There are no three people in a town or in the countryside who do not establish (congregational) prayer, but the Shaytaan has gained control over them. You must adhere to jamaa’ah, for the wolf eats the sheep that wanders off alone.’” (Sunan Abi Dawood, 547; see also Saheeh al-Jaami’. Zaa’idah said, al-Saa’ib said, jamaa’ah refers to praying in jamaa’ah).
 With regard to praying in jamaa’ah, Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (mayAllaah have mercy on him) said:
Allaah has given prayer in jamaa’ah a high status in His Book, and His Messenger Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) also gave it a high status. Allaah commanded us to establish regular prayer, and to do prayer in congregation. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Guard strictly (five obligatory) As‑Salawaat (the prayers) especially the middle Salaat (i.e. the best prayer ‑ ‘Asr). And stand before Allaah with obedience [and do not speak to others during the Salaat (prayers)]
[al-Baqarah 2:238]
 What indicates that it obligatory to pray in jamaa’ah is the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):
“And perform As-Salaat (Iqaamat-as-Salaat), and give Zakaat, and bow down (or submit yourselves with obedience to Allâh) along with Ar‑Raaki‘oon [Those who bow down or submit themselves with obedience to Allaah].”
[al-Baqarah 2:43]
 At the beginning of the aayah, Allaah commands us to perform prayer, then He commands us to join other worshippers in their prayer, by saying (interpretation of the meaning), “bow down … along with Ar‑Raaki‘oon [Those who bow down …].”
 Allaah has enjoined us to do the prayer in congregation (jamaa’ah) with others even at times of war, so how about at times of peace? Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“When you (O Messenger Muhammad) are among them, and lead them in As‑Salaat (the prayer), let one party of them stand up [in Salaat (prayer)] with you taking their arms with them; when they finish their prostrations, let them take their positions in the rear and let the other party come up which have not yet prayed, and let them pray with you taking all the precautions and bearing arms…” [al-Nisaa’ 4:102]
If anyone were to be permitted to not pray in jamaa’ah, it would be those who are engaged in combat.
 It was narrated in al-Saheehayn from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “I was thinking of ordering the prayer to be called and the iqaamah to be given, then I would appoint a man to lead the people in prayer, whilst I went out with some men carrying bundles of wood, to go to people who did not attend the prayer and burn their houses down around them.” (Saheeh al-Bukhaari, 2/852, no. 2288; Muslim, 1/451, no. 651). In Saheeh Muslim (1/453, no. 654) it is narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “Whoever would like to meet Allaah tomorrow as a Muslim, let him uphold these five prayers whenever the call to prayer is given. Allaah has prescribed for you the ways of guidance, and these prayers are among the ways of guidance. If you pray in your houses like this man who stays behind in his house, you have abandoned the Sunnah of your Prophet, and if you abandon the Sunnah of your Prophet, you will go astray. There is no man who purifies himself and does it well, then sets out for one of these mosques, but for every step he takes, Allaah will write down for him one hasanah (good deed) and raise his status by one degree, and wipe out for him one sayi’ah (bad deed). There was a time when no one stayed away from (the prayers) but the hypocrites who were known for their hypocrisy. A man would come supported by others on each side, so that he could stand in the rows (of worshippers)…”
 In Saheeh Muslim (1/452) it is narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that a blind man said, “O Messenger of Allaah, I do not have anyone to guide me to the mosque. Can I have a dispensation to pray in my house?” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Can you hear the call to prayer?” He said, “Yes.” He said, “Then answer it.”
 Praying regularly in congregation brings a number of benefits, such as getting to know one another, cooperating in righteousness and piety, advising one another with the truth and to follow it patiently, teaching the ignorant, manifesting the symbols of Islam, annoying the hypocrites, keeping away from their path, knowing who keeps away from praying in jamaa’ah, advising him and teaching him if it is because of laziness on his part or he has no excuse, visiting him if he is sick, and other benefits. Keeping away from praying in jamaa’ah may lead – Allaah forbid – to giving up prayer altogether. It is well known that not praying is kufr and misguidance which puts a person beyond the pale of Islam, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “All that stands between a man and kufr and shirk is his giving up prayer.” (Narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh, 1/88, no. 82, from Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah (may Allaah be pleased with him)).
 And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The covenant that separates us from them is salaah; whoever neglects it is a kaafir.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, who said it is a saheeh hasan hadeeth. Saheeh Ibn Hibbaan, 4/305, no. 1454).
 Know, my brother, that Allaah cannot enjoin a ruling upon His slaves and then goodness is to be found in something else. Allaah has enjoined prayer in jamaa’ah so this is what has to be done and we have to strive to feel khushoo’ in it. But it may so happen that sometimes a person feels more khushoo’ when he prays alone than when he prays in the mosque, as many worshippers feel during qiyaam al-layl, when they weep in their own houses in a way that they do not do in the mosque.  This does not mean that they should not pray in the mosque. What is required of us is that we should strive to implement the means of feeling khushoo’ when we pray in jamaa’ah and in other prayers, and we should do all the prayers as commanded by Allaah. For more information on the means of attaining khushoo’ in prayer, see “""33 ways of developing Khushoo’ in Prayer” "",
in the Books section of this web-site.
And Allaah knows best, and He is the Guide to the best Way. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

      dirty things whilst praying","Is it okay to keep
      things that might be dirty (like handkerchiefs, wallet & car keys) in
      our pocket while we pray? If not, are we supposed to keep them on the
      ground in front of us while we pray? Or by the side? Is it okay if it ends
      up in front of someone else, say in a congregational prayer?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Dirty things are of two types: Things that
    are considered dirty or unclean according to sharee’ah because of najaasah
    (impurity), such as human urine or faeces, and things that are considered
    dirty by people, but they are not naajis according to sharee’ah, such as
    mucus and spittle. It is not permissible to carry the former or have them on
    one’s person whilst praying or to put them in the mosque; it does not
    matter if one carries the latter in one's pocket whilst praying. And Allaah
    knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
6297,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6297,"Will Iblees enter    Hell, and why?","A non-muslim who does not believe in God, will he get more punishment then the Shaytan ( Iblis ) himself ? Iblis believes in Allah... Is there a verse in Quran that says that Iblis will go to hell ? Why did Iblis disobey Allah when he knew that Allah is AllPowerfull ? If Allah wanted him to disobey, then will he still have to be in hell for ever ? Please tell me about this issue...Will Iblis go to hell for ever ?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Praise be to Allah.
The matter of punishments is for Allaah to decide, and we know nothing about it except that which He has told us. The Kuffaar and Mushrikeen are major sinners who will abide in Hell forever, they and Iblees, may Allaah curse him. We will now look at some verses of the Qur'aan which are evidence of that, and we will discuss why Iblees disbelieved and what will be his fate and the fate of those who follow him.

Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
""(Remember) when your Lord said to the angels: 'Truly, I am going to create man from clay. So when I have fashioned him and breathed into him (his) soul created by Me, then you fall down prostrate to him.' So the angels prostrated themselves, all of them, Except Iblees (Satan), he was proud and was one of the disbelievers. (Allaah) said: 'O Iblees (Satan)! What prevents you from prostrating yourself to one whom I have created with Both My Hands. Are you too proud (to fall prostrate to Adam) or are you one of the high exalted?' [Iblees (Satan)] said: 'I am better than he. You created me from fire, and You created him from clay.' (Allaah) said: ""Then get out from here; for verily, you are outcast. And verily, My Curse is on you till the Day of Recompense.' [Iblees (Satan)] said: ""'My Lord! Give me then respite till the Day the (dead) are resurrected.' (Allaah) said: 'Verily, you are of those allowed respite Till the Day of the time appointed.' [Iblees (Satan)] said: 'By Your Might, then I will surely, mislead them all, Except Your chosen slaves amongst them (i.e. faithful, obedient, true believers of Islamic Monotheism).' (Allaah) said: 'The truth is - and the truth I say * That I will fill Hell with you [Iblees (Satan)] and those of them (mankind) that follow you, together.'"" [Saad 38:71-85]

Iblees disobeyed his Lord and refused, stubbornly and arrogantly, to prostrate to Adam. This indicates the serious nature of self-admiration and pride. We ask Allaah to keep us safe and sound from that.

The fact that Iblees believed in the existence of Allaah, acknowledged His Might and swore an oath by that did not benefit him at all, because his belief was cancelled out by his stubbornness, pride and arrogant behaviour before Allaah when he refused to obey His command.

Allaah created Iblees for reasons which are known to Him, may He be glorified and exalted, and to be a test and a trial for mankind. Whoever obeys Allaah and disobeys Iblees will enter Paradise, and whoever disobeys Allaah and obeys Iblees will enter Hell. The fact that Allaah created Iblees does not imply that He approves of what Iblees does - we seek refuge with Allaah - but this was the decree of the Lord of the Worlds. Allaah does not approve of kufr or sin. He says (interpretation of the meaning):
""If you disbelieve, then verily, Allaah is not in need of you, He likes not disbelief for His slaves. And if you are grateful (by being believers), He is pleased therewith for you. No bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another"" [al-Zumar 39:7]
The point of this aayah is: ""He likes not disbelief for His slaves"". Allaah's will is of two types: His shar'i (legislative) will, which refers to what He wills and loves, including that which He has prescribed for His slaves; and His kawni (universal) will, which refers to what He wills to happen - for reasons that are known to Him - but this does not necessarily mean that He likes what happens.

Who has guided us, and may He send peace and blessings upon our master Muhammad and his family and companions.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
