50508,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50508,He does not pray and he lives with his girlfriend; he wants to repent and marry her,"There is a French Muslim man who does not pray or fast, and he lives with his Christian girlfriend. He wants to repent and fast, but he is using the fact that this woman is living with him as an excuse. Is it permissible for him to marry her now, knowing that tomorrow is the first day of Ramadaan? If that is permissible, then what is the prescribed shar’i procedure for that?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.This person and others should note that not praying is kufr which puts a person beyond the pale of Islam. Islam does not accept for any of its followers not to pray or fast and to live with a girlfriend. 
What you have to do is to advise him and explain to him what Islam really is, which is submitting to the rulings of sharee’ah. The Muslim should be an example to others, especially in that (non-Muslim) country, for he is not representing himself only, rather he is representing Islam which he has embraced and committed himself to. So he has to give up the sin that he is committing and adhere to the rulings of sharee’ah, especially prayer which is the thing that distinguishes between Islam and kufr.
 Secondly: 
We are very happy to learn that he wants to repent, so what is stopping him from repenting? Allaah rejoices over the repentance of His believing slave. When a person turns to Allaah, Allaah turns to him and forgives his sin. So he should hasten to repent and not delay it or make it conditional upon certain things happening, lest he dies without having repented and he meets his Lord with a burden of sin and may even meet Him in state of kufr. 
Tell him that Allaah turns bad deeds into good deeds for the one who repents. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Except those who repent and believe (in Islamic Monotheism), and do righteous deeds; for those, Allaah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allaah is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful”
[al-Furqaan 25:70]
So he must hasten to repent by giving up all that he is doing that incurs the wrath of Allaah, namely not praying and living with his girlfriend. 
See the answers to questions no. 624, 13990, 34905, 22912. 
Thirdly: 
If he repents to Allaah, he should note that it is not permissible for him to marry that girlfriend, not because she is Christian, but because she is a zaaniyah (fornicatress) – according to what he has said. One of the conditions of marrying a woman of the People of the Book (i.e., a Jewish or Christian woman) is that she should be chaste, not a fornicatress or a woman who has a lover or boyfriend. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Made lawful to you this day are At‑Tayyibaat [all kinds of Halaal (lawful) foods, which Allaah has made lawful (meat of slaughtered eatable animals, milk products, fats, vegetables and fruits)]. The food (slaughtered cattle, eatable animals) of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) is lawful to you and yours is lawful to them. (Lawful to you in marriage) are chaste women from the believers and chaste women from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before your time when you have given their due Mahr (bridal-money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage), desiring chastity (i.e. taking them in legal wedlock) not committing illegal sexual intercourse, nor taking them as girlfriends”
[al-Maa’idah 5:5]
Allaah has stipulated that in order to marry them, they must be chaste. It is not permissible for a Muslim to marry a woman of the people of the Book who is not chaste. Even if a woman is a Muslim but she is not chaste, it is not permissible for a chaste Muslim man to marry her. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The adulterer — fornicator marries not but an adulteress — fornicatress or a Mushrikah; and the adulteress –fornicatress, none marries her except an adulterer — fornicater or a Mushrik. Such a thing is forbidden to the believers (of Islamic Monotheism)”
[al-Nur 24:3]
For more details on this issue, please see the answer to question no. 11195 and 2527. 
If he wants to marry her, that can only happen after he repents and comes back to Islam by starting to pray, and after they both repent from zina (fornication). 
This applies if he wants to marry her. 
The duty of being sincere (naseehah) compels us to tell him of the best way we know of setting straight both his religious and worldly affairs, which is that he should repent to Allaah sincerely, and hasten to leave this woman without any hesitation or delay, and look for another woman who is a chaste, believing Muslim. If he repents to Allaah, he will need someone who understands her religion and will stand by him and encourage him to obey the Most Merciful after this deviation. As for that woman, even if she repents from fornication she will never be able to help him to obey Allaah and she will never be trustworthy with regard to his household, his wealth and his honour, and she will never be fit to raise his sons and daughters. We mean nothing but good by offering this sincere advice. Let him use his mind and avoid being emotional, then he will know that this is right. 
If he looks around him, he will see other Muslims who have married non-Muslim women, and how bad their situations are, and how they regret it and wish that they had not married non-Muslim woman.

50522,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50522,They live in Holland – with whom should they start fasting?,"I live in Holland, and the people differed concerning the first day of Ramadaan. Some fasted with Egypt, and some waited until the announcement came from the Arabian Peninsula. What is the correct view?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
      Firstly: 

    According to sharee’ah, the onset of Ramadaan cannot be 
    proven except by sighting the new moon, because the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Fast when you see it and break the 
    fast when you see it.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1909; Muslim, 1081. There is 
    no room for the use of astronomical calculations in proving the onset of the 
    month. 

    Undoubtedly the moon sighting varies from one country to 
    another – especially those that are far away from one another. The dispute 
    is not about differences in moon sighting, for no one disputes that. Rather 
    the dispute is whether the differences in moon sighting have any effect on 
    proving that Ramadaan has begun from one country to another. 

    Secondly: 

    If Muslims who live in non-Muslim countries have an Islamic 
    organization or council to whom they can refer and depend on their moon 
    sighting to confirm that the month has begun and ended, then the Standing 
    Committee has issued a fatwa stating that this council comes under the same 
    ruling as an Islamic government for those Muslims, so they must follow them 
    with regard to the beginning and end of the month. 

    The details of this are given in the answer to question no. 
    1248. 

    But if they do not have an Islamic organization, there is no 
    sin on them if they follow a country that they trust, which follows the 
    moonsighting according to sharee’ah, not astronomical calculations, so they 
    start and end the fast with that country. 

    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked 
    about a person who was staying in Spain during Ramadaan and fasted according 
    to the Land of the Two Holy Sanctuaries. He replied: 
What you have mentioned 
    about your fasting with us and breaking the fast with us, because you are 
    staying in Spain during Ramadaan, there is nothing wrong with that and there 
    is no sin on you. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said: “Fast when you see it (the new moon) and stop fasting when you 
    see it, and if it is cloudy and you cannot see it, then complete the number 
    of days as thirty.” This is general in meaning and applies to all of the 
    ummah. The Land of the Two Holy Sanctuaries is most deserving to be followed 
    because they strive to rule according to sharee’ah – may Allaah increase 
    them in guidance – and because you are staying in a country which is not 
    ruled by Islam and its people do not pay any attention to Islamic rulings.

50536,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50536,Ruling on prayers being led by one whose pronunciation is defective,Our imam pronounces the Arabic letter ta’ as daad. What is the ruling on his leading the prayers?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.The one who substitutes one letter for another is known in Arabic as althagh (one whose pronunciation is defective). Several scenarios may apply in such a case: 
1 – The defect in his pronunciation may be mild, so that he basically pronounces the letter, but not perfectly. In this case the defective pronunciation does not matter and he may lead the prayers. 
It says in Tuhfat al-Manhaaj (2/285): 
A slight defect in pronunciation does not matter, in the sense that the person basically pronounces the letter but it is not exact. End quote. 
Al-Mardaawi narrated in al-Insaaf (2/271) that al-Aamidi said: If that – i.e., defective pronunciation – is mild, then it does not mean that the prayer is invalid, but if it is severe then the prayer is not valid. End quote. 
2 – If the defective pronunciation is severe, such as substituting one letter for another, and the person is able to correct it but does not do so, in this case the person’s prayer is not valid and he may not lead the prayers, if that (mispronounced) letter appears in al-Faatihah. 
Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmoo’ (4/359): 
It is essential to recite al-Faatihah in prayer with all its letters, including those which are doubled (letters with shaddah) … if a shaddah is omitted or one letter is substituted for another even though the person is able to pronounce it, then his recitation is not valid. End quote. 
He also said (4/166): 
If a person whose pronunciation is defective is able to learn how to pronounce things properly, then his prayer is invalid in and of itself, and it is not permissible to follow him as an imam, and there is no scholarly dispute on this point. End quote. 
Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni (2/15): 
Whoever omits a letter of al-Faatihah because he is unable to pronounce it, or substitutes another letter for it, such as pronouncing the ra’ as ghayn… if he is able to correct any of that and does not do so, then his prayer is not valid and neither is the prayer of anyone who follows him as an imam. End quote. 
3 – If the defective pronunciation is severe, such as substituting one letter for another, but he is not able to correct his pronunciation, in this case his prayer is valid, according to scholarly consensus. 
Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmoo’ (4/166): 
If a person with defective pronunciation is not able to learn, because his tongue cannot pronounce the letters or there is too little time, and he cannot do that, then his prayer is valid in and of itself. End quote. 
The scholars differed as to whether it is valid for such a person to lead the prayers or not. 
Many or most scholars are of the view that it is not valid; others are of the view that it is valid. 
In al-Majmoo’ (4/166), al-Nawawi narrated that the view that it is valid was favoured by al-Muzani, Abu Thawr and Ibn al-Mundhir; this is also the view of ‘Ata’ and Qataadah. 
In Haashiyat Ibn ‘Aabideen (1/582) it is narrated that the view favoured by some of the Hanafi scholars is that it is acceptable for a person whose pronunciation is defective to lead the prayer. 
These scholars quoted evidence for that, such as the following: 
1 – The verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allaah burdens not a person beyond his scope”
[al-Baqarah 2:286]
If a person is unable to pronounce the letters properly, then he is not burdened with more than he is able to do. 
2 – Analogy with one who is unable to stand. Standing is an essential part of the prayer without which an obligatory prayer is invalid, but it is waived in the case of one who is unable to stand and if he leads the prayer, the prayer is valid. The same applies to one whose pronunciation is defective leading the prayer, because he is unable to pronounce the words properly. 
See al-Majmoo’, 4/166. 
Ibn Hazm said in al-Muhalla (3/134): 
As for the one whose pronunciation is defective or the one whose recitation is not clear, or the one with a foreign tongue (one who does not differentiate between daad and za’ or between seen and saad, and so on), or the one who makes many mistakes in grammar, it is permissible to pray behind them, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allaah burdens not a person beyond his scope”
[al-Baqarah 2:286]
So they are not expected to do more than they are able to, or anything that they are not able to. They have performed their prayers as they were commanded, and whoever performs his prayer as he was commanded, has done well, and Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“No ground (of complaint) can there be against the Muhsinoon (good-doers)”
[al-Tawbah 9:91]
End quote. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was asked: 
I heard someone say that it is not valid for a person whose pronunciation is defective to lead the people in prayer, i.e., it is not valid to pray behind him, because he has a fault. Is this correct or not?  
He replied: 
This is correct according to some scholars, who think that if a person whose speech is defective substitutes one letter for another, such as substituting ghayn or laam for ra’, and so on, then it is not valid for him to lead the prayers, because he is like an illiterate man, and it is not valid for an illiterate man to lead anyone in prayer except others who are like him. Other scholars think that it is valid for him to lead others in prayer because if a person’s own prayer is valid, it is valid for him to lead others in prayer, and because he is doing what he is obliged to do, namely fearing Allaah as much as he can. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you can”
[al-Taghaabun 64:16]
If an imam is unable to stand, he may still lead others in prayer who are able to do so, and this case is similar, because in both cases the person is unable to do something which is an essential part of the prayer – one is unable to stand and one is unable to recite properly. This view is the one which is correct: it is valid for one whose pronunciation is defective to lead the prayer, even if he substitutes one letter for another, so long as this is what he is able to do. But nevertheless we should choose a person to lead the prayer who has no faults, so as to be on the safe side and avoid an area concerning which there is scholarly dispute.

Secondly: 
With regard to what the questioner mentions about substituting daad for taa’, if he really is substituting it with daad every time, then the ruling on this case is mentioned above. If this substitution is not obvious, then the defect in pronunciation may be mild and may not matter. 
It may be that the questioner is being inappropriately harsh.",Islam Q&A
50547,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50547,Is There Tarawih the Night before Ramadan?,"When should we start to pray Tarawih prayer, on the night of the first day of Ramadan (when the moon is sighted or the previous month is completed) or after ‘Isha prayer on the first day of Ramadan?","It is prescribed for the Muslim to perform Tarawih prayer after ‘Isha on the first night of Ramadan, which is the night on which the new moon is sighted or the Muslims complete thirty days of Sha`ban.","When does tarawih start?


When does tarawih end?


Is tarawih compulsory?

Can you pray tarawih outside of Ramadan?","Praise be to Allah.When does tarawih start?
It is prescribed for the Muslim to perform Tarawih prayer after ‘Isha on the first night of Ramadan, which is the night on which the new moon is sighted or the Muslims complete thirty days of Sha`ban. 
When does tarawih end?
Similarly at the end of Ramadan, Tarawih prayer should not be offered if it is proven that the month has ended, either by sighting of the new moon of ‘Eid or if the month of thirty days has been completed. 
It is clear that Tarawih prayer is not connected to the fast during the day in Ramadan, rather it is connected to the onset of the month at night in the beginning, and the last day of Ramadan at the end. 
Is tarawih compulsory?
We should not say that Taraweeh prayer is a nafl prayer and it is permissible to offer it on any night and in congregation, because Tarawih prayer is limited to the month of Ramadan, and those who offer this prayer are seeking the reward that comes for praying it. 
Should tarawih be offered in congregation?
The ruling on offering this prayer in congregation is different from the ruling on offering other prayers in congregation. In Ramadan, it is permissible to pray Tarawih in congregation on each night, whilst announcing it and encouraging others to join, unlike qiyam at other times, where praying qiyam in congregation is not part of the Sunnah unless it is done without having the intention beforehand, or it is done for the purpose of encouraging and teaching others.  So it is Sunnah to do it sometimes without committing to doing it all the time or persisting in that. 
Can you pray tarawih outside of Ramadan?
Shaykh Muhammad al-Salih al-‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Tarawih at times other than Ramadan is an innovation (bid’ah). For example, if the people wanted to gather to pray qiyam in congregation in the mosque at times other than Ramadan, this would be an innovation. 
There is nothing wrong with a person praying in congregation in his house occasionally at times other than Ramadan, because this is what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did. Once he led Ibn ‘Abbas, and once Ibn Mas’ud and once Hudhayfah ibn al-Yaman, in prayer in his house, but he did not adopt that as a regular Sunnah and he did not do that in the mosque.” (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 4/60, 61) 
Based on this, whoever offers Tarawih prayers before it is proven that Ramadan has begun is like one who offers a prayer at the wrong time. No reward will be written for him, even if he is free of the sin of doing that deliberately.

The scholars are unanimously agreed that it is permissible for those who are sick not to fast, and the basic principle concerning that is the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “but if any of you is ill or on a journey, the same number (should be made up) from other days”. End quote. 
Al-Mughni, 3/88 
The kind of sickness which makes it permissible not to fast is that in which a person will be harmed by fasting, or fasting will delay his recovery. Taking medicine is not an excuse unless it is not possible to take it at any time other than the day of the fast. If the sick person can take the medicine at the time of sahoor and after Maghrib, and fasting does not harm him, then it is not permissible for him not to fast. If he needs to take the medicine during the day, then there is no sin on him if he breaks the fast and makes up the days that he missed.
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:  
Our companions said: The condition that it be permissible not to fast is that fasting will cause him hardship that is too much for him to bear. As for a mild sickness that does not cause any obvious hardship, it is not permissible for him not to fast, and there is no difference of opinion among us. End quote. 
Al-Majmoo’, 6/257 
Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
The kind of sickness which makes it permissible not to fast is sickness which is severe and may get worse in the case of fasting, or where there is the fear that fasting may delay recovery.

Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
What is prescribed for the sick person is not to fast during Ramadan if fasting will harm him or is too difficult for him, or if he needs treatment during the day in the form of medicine, pills and the like, which are eaten or drunk, because Allah says, “but if any of you is ill or on a journey, the same number (should be made up) from other days”, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah likes His concession to be accepted just as He dislikes sins to be committed.” According to another report: “As He likes His commandments to be fulfilled.” End quote.
Fatawa Islaamiyyah, 2/139 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: 
If the sick person takes his medicine during Ramadan after dawn comes, then his fast is not valid, because he has deliberately broken the fast, but he has to refrain from eating and drinking for the rest of the day, unless it is too difficult for him to refrain because of his sickness, in which case he may break the fast because of the sickness, but he has to make it up, because he deliberately broke the fast. 
It is not permissible for a sick person to take medicine when he is fasting in Ramadan, except in the case of necessity, such as if we fear that he may die, in which case we would give him medicine to help him. In this case he is breaking the fast but there is no sin on him if he breaks his fast because of sickness. End quote. 
Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 19/question no. 76 
If your sickness is ongoing and chronic, and means that you cannot make up the fasts, then you do not have to fast or make up the fasts, rather what you have to do is to feed one poor person one meal for each day in Ramadan that you do not fast.

There is a sick man who has heart disease; only a small part of his heart works and he needs to take medicine all the time, i.e., approximately every six or eight hours. Is fasting waived in his case?

Yes, fasting is waived in his case, and he should feed one poor person for each day. If he wants he may give each poor person one-quarter of a saa’ of rice, and if he gives some meat too that will be better, or if he wants, he may offer them dinner on the last night of Ramadan, or lunch on any day after Ramadan.

I would like you to tell me some simple phrases that have to do with this question, and some phrases that will warn of punishment and encourage seeking reward.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    You can remind this person and advise him by explaining the 
    ruling on not praying, and on not praying in congregation in the mosque, and 
    explain how the early generations of Muslims were with regard to prayer. 

    The ruling on not praying:

    In a number of questions we have explained that the one who 
    does not pray is a kaafir who is beyond the pale of Islam; no good deeds 
    will be accepted from him on the Day of Resurrection; and his marriage 
    contract with his wife must be annulled if she does pray. This one who does 
    not pray should also understand that any meat slaughtered by him cannot be 
    eaten; and (if he dies) he cannot be washed, have the funeral prayer offered 
    for him, or be buried in the Muslim graveyard. 

    It was narrated from Samurah ibn Jundub (may Allah be pleased 
    with him) that the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon 
    him) mentioned a dream that he had seen and said: “Last night two people 
    came to me and said, ‘Let’s go,’ so I went with them. We came to a man who 
    was lying down, with another man standing over him, holding a big rock. He 
    threw the rock at the man’s head, smashing it. The rock rolled away, and the 
    one who had thrown it followed it, and picked it up. By the time he came 
    back to the man, his head had been restored to its former state. Then he 
    (the one who had thrown the rock) did the same as he had done before. I said 
    to (my two companions), ‘Subhaan Allaah! What is this?’ They said to me: 
    Move on…” 

    At the end of the hadeeth, he (blessings and peace of Allah 
    be upon him) said: “They said to me: ‘The first man whom you saw with his 
    head being smashed with the rock, is the man who learned the Qur’aan then 
    abandoned it, and he went to sleep, neglecting the obligatory prayers.’”

    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6640 

    Muhammad ibn Nasr al-Marwazi said: 

    I heard Ishaaq – i.e., ibn Raahawayh – say: It was narrated 
    in a saheeh report from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon 
    him) that the one who does not pray is a kaafir. It was the opinion of the 
    scholars from the time of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon 
    him) that the one who deliberately does not pray, without any excuse, until 
    the time for the prayer ends, is a kaafir. The time for the prayer ending 
    means delaying Zuhr until sunset and Maghrib until sunrise. 

    Ta‘zeem Qadr as-Salaah, 2/929 

    For the ruling on the one who does not pray, please see the 
    answers to questions no. 7864,
    5208 and
    2182 

    With regard to praying in congregation in the mosque:

    Just as the prayer is what differentiates between the Muslim 
    and the kaafir, praying in congregation is the sign that differentiates 
    between the believer and the hypocrite. The Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased 
    with them) regarded the one who did not attend prayer in congregation as a 
    hypocrite whose hypocrisy was known. 

    Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan (may Allah preserve him) was asked: 

    I am a young man, not married, and I pray but not 
    continually, i.e., I do not always offer the prayer on time, and sometimes I 
    miss the prayers for a whole day, or I do them all together. What is the 
    Islamic ruling on that? 

    He replied: 

    The Muslim is required to offer the prayers regularly on 
    time, with the congregation of Muslims. It is not permissible to delay the 
    prayer until its time is over. Allah, may He be exalted, says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, the prayer is enjoined on the 
    believers at fixed hours” [an-Nisa’ 4:103], i.e., it is enjoined at 
    specific times, at which it should be offered. According to a report: “Allah 
    has deeds at night that He does not accept during the day, and deeds during 
    the day that He does not accept at night.” Delaying the prayer until the 
    time for it is over is neglecting it. Allah, may He be exalted, says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): “Then, there has succeeded them a 
    posterity who have given up As-Salat (the prayers) (i.e. made their Salat 
    (prayers) to be lost, either by not offering them or by not offering them 
    perfectly or by not offering them in their proper fixed times, etc.) and 
    have followed lusts. So they will be thrown in Hell, except those who 
    repent…” [Maryam 19:59, 60]. 

    Putting two prayers together is not permissible, unless there 
    is a legitimate shar‘i excuse at the time of one of them, such as putting 
    Zuhr together with ‘Asr, or Maghrib together with ‘Isha’. But putting the 
    prayers of an entire day together is not permissible and prayers are not 
    valid if done in this manner.

    With regard to how the early generations of Muslims were 
    with regard to praying in congregation in the mosque:

    They regarded it as something of the utmost importance, to 
    which they paid a great deal of attention and were keen to offer the prayer 
    in congregation in the mosque even if they had excuses not to do so. 

    Wakee‘ ibn al-Jarraah said, narrating from al-A‘mash 
    Sulaymaan ibn Mahraan: al-A‘mash was nearly seventy years old but he never 
    missed the first takbeer. 

    Muhammad ibn al-Mubaarak as-Soori said: If Sa‘eed ibn ‘Abd 
    al-‘Azeez al-Tanookhi missed the prayer in congregation, he would weep. 

    It was narrated from Muhammad ibn Khafeef that he had a pain 
    in his side that, when it affected him, prevented him from moving. But when 
    the call to prayer was given, he would be carried on a man’s back. It was 
    said to him: Why don’t you take it easy on yourself? He said: If you hear 
    (the words of the adhaan), Hayya ‘ala as-salaah (come to prayer) and 
    you do not see me in the row (of worshippers), then look for me in the 
    graveyard. 

    ‘Aamir ibn ‘Abdillah ibn az-Zubayr heard the mu’adhdhin when 
    he was dying and he said: Hold my hand (and take me to the prayer). It was 
    said: You are sick. He said: I can hear the caller of Allah; should I not 
    respond to him? So they took him by the hand and he joined the imam in 
    praying Maghrib; he prayed one rak‘ah then he died.
