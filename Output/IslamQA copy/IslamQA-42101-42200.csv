On the Friday, I heard that it is not permissible to fast on the Days of al-Tashreeq and that Thursday was the third of the days of al-Tashreeq. Is there any sin on me if I fasted that day? Is it true that it is not permissible to fast on the days of al-Tashreeq or should we avoid fasting only on the first days of Eid?",Fasting on the two days of Eid is haram. It is also haram to fast on the days of al-Tashreeq which are the three days after Eid al-Adha.,"Can you fast on Eid?


Can you fast on Days of Tashreeq?


Can a pilgrim fast the Days of Tashreeq?","Praise be to Allah.Can you fast on Eid?
Fasting on the two days of Eid is haraam, as indicated by the hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade fasting on the day of al-Fitr and al-Nahr .” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1992; Muslim, 827) The scholars are unanimously agreed that fasting on these two days is haraam. 
Can you fast on Days of Tashreeq?
It is also haraam to fast on the days of al-Tashreeq which are the three days after Eid al-Adha (the 11th, 12th and 13th of Dhu’l-Hijjah).  because tThe Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The days of al-Tashreeq are days of eating, drinking and remembering Allah.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1141)
Abu Dawood (2418) narrated from Abu Murrah the freed slave of Umm Haani that he entered with ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr upon his father ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas. He offered them food and said, “Eat.” He said, “I am fasting.” ‘Amr said: “Eat, for these are the days on which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would tell us not to fast and forbade us to fast, and these are the days of al-Tashreeq .” (Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood) 
Can a pilgrim fast the Days of Tashreeq?
But it is permissible to fast on the days of al-Tashreeq for a pilgrim who does not have a hadiy (sacrificial animal). It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah and Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them) said: No one was allowed to fast on the days of al-Tashreeq except one who could not find a hadiy. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1998)
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: 
“It is permissible for those who are doing Hajj qiraan or tamattu’, if they cannot find a hadiy, to fast these three days so that the Hajj season will not end before they fast. But apart from that it is not permissible to fast on these days, even if a person is obliged to fast for two consecutive months; he should not fast on the day of Eid and the three days following it, but then he should continue his fast.” (Fataawa Ramadaan, p. 727)

42153,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/42153,Uncovering Shoulder During Tawaf: When?,"I did tawaf al-ifadah on the day of ‘Eid straight after moving from Muzdalifah, i.e., before stoning Jamarat al-‘Aqabah or shaving my head. Should I have uncovered my right shoulder in this tawaf, given that I was still in ihram? Thank you.","Uncovering the right shoulder and walking quickly with short steps (raml) are recommended in the tawaf of `Umrah, and in the tawaf of arrival (tawaf al-qudum) for those who are doing ifrad and qiran Hajj.",,"Praise be to Allah.It is only prescribed to uncover the right shoulder and walk quickly with short steps (raml) in the tawaf of `Umrah , and in the tawaf of arrival (tawaf al-qudum) for those who are doing ifrad and qiran Hajj. 
In other tawafs , these actions are not prescribed, so in tawaf al-ifadah there is no raml and no uncovering the shoulder, whether you did tawaf in ihram or not. 
Abu Dawud (2001) narrated from Ibn `Abbas that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not walk quickly in the seven circuits of tawaf al-ifadah. This was classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud. 
Uncovering the right shoulder and walking quickly with short steps (raml ) go together. When raml is prescribed, uncovering the right shoulder is also prescribed; when raml is not prescribed, uncovering the shoulder is not prescribed either. 
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Majmu’, 8/43 
“Uncovering the right shoulder goes along with raml. When it is mustahabb [recommended] to walk quickly (raml) it is also prescribed to uncover the right shoulder, and when it is not recommended to walk quickly, it is not prescribed to uncover the shoulder either. When the scholars differed, that had to do with both uncovering the shoulder and walking quickly [i.e., the two actions are not separated]. There is no difference of opinion on this matter. 
He also said: But raml and uncovering the shoulder are separate in one case, which is that uncovering the shoulder is Sunnah in all seven circuits, but raml is only Sunnah in the first three circuits, and one should walk (normally) in the last four.” (Al-Majmu’, 8/20) 
Ibn Qudamah said in al-Mughni (5/221), it is mustahabb to walk quickly and uncover the right shoulder in the Tawaf of ‘Umrah and in the Tawaf of arrival. Then he said: 
“It is not Sunnah to walk quickly or to uncover the right shoulder in tawaf except in the cases we have mentioned, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his Companions only walked quickly and uncovered their shoulders at those times.” 
It says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah (11/225): 
“It is Sunnah to uncover the right shoulder in all circuits of the tawaf of arrival only, and it is prescribed to walk quickly in the first three circuits of the tawaf of arrival for those doing Hajj and those doing ‘Umrah.” 
Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“He should walk quickly (raml) in the first three circuits of the first tawaf, which is the tawaf he performs when he first arrives in Makkah, whether he is doing ‘Umrah or tamattu’, or he has entered ihram for Hajj only, or is combining Hajj and ‘Umrah (qiran). And he should walk in the last four circuits, starting each circuit with rapid steps. And it is mustahabb for him to uncover his right shoulder throughout this tawaf, but not in others.” (Fatawa Ibn Baz, 16/60)

42165,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/42165,How can I advise someone who is addicted to pornography?,"I have a friend who uses the internet and goes to pornographic websites. What is the shar’i ruling on that, and how can I help him to keep away from such things?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to look at pornographic pictures that show the charms of women, either on internet web sites or in newspapers or magazines etc. That is because looking at them is a means of enjoying them and knowing the beauty of the woman in the picture. 
This may also be a means that leads to something haraam, so it is also regarded as haraam, because the means come under the same rulings as the ends. 
Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 2424. 
Many people take the matter of looking at pictures of non-mahram women lightly, on the grounds that these are just pictures and are not real. But this is a very serious matter, because it inevitably tempts a man to try to look at the woman directly. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts). That is purer for them”
[al-Noor 24:30]
Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Rasaa’il Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 1/268
You can help your friend to keep away from these things by always advising him and making him fear Allaah, and reminding him that Allaah is always watching him and that nothing is hidden from Him. And remind him of the blessings that Allaah has bestowed upon him, such as giving him eyes with which to see things that will benefit him, and He has forbidden him to use them to look at things that He has forbidden. Remind him that Allaah will question him about that, hence Allaah concludes the verse referred to above with the words (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, Allaah is All-Aware of what they do”
[al-Noor 24:30]
And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, the hearing, and the sight, and the heart of each of those ones will be questioned (by Allaah)”
[al-Isra’ 17:36]
If a wise man thinks about it, when he is looking at these haraam pictures, he will realize that there is nothing behind these glances but loss, pain and sorrow, because he cannot really get what he sees in these pictures. 
The poet spoke the truth when he said: 
“When you give free rein to your eyes, this will cause great pain to your heart.
You will see what you cannot have, and you will feel frustration because you do not have some of what you see.” 
So it is clear that there is nothing to be gained from these pictures except the wrath of Allaah, and wasting time and money on things that are not pleasing to Him, and tormenting yourself. 
The Muslim has to seek chastity by means of marriage, and try his best to achieve that. 
He should also give up bad company who may have a bad effect on him and encourage him to go to these bad web sites. 
He should also keep himself busy with things that will benefit him in both religious and worldly terms, such as memorizing the Book of Allaah, attending gatherings of dhikr, and going to useful websites that contain sound knowledge.",Islam Q&A
42178,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/42178,Punishment for not fulfilling vows,"What is the punishment of one who vows to do an act of worship, then is negligent and does not do it?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
Vows are of two types: 
1 – Conditional vows, in which the vow is dependent upon something happening, as when a person says, “If Allah heals me, I will give such and such in charity, or I will fast such and such a number of days,” and so on. 
2 – Unconditional vows (which are not connected to anything), such as saying, “I will fast such and such a number of days for Allah.” 
Both types of vows must be fulfilled, if what is vowed is to do an act of worship. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever vows to obey Allah, let him obey Him, and whoever vows to disobey Him let him not disobey Him.”  
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6696. 
The obligation to fulfil a vow is stronger in the case of an conditional vow, although it is obligatory to fulfil both types, as stated above. 
Ibn al-Qayyim said: 
If a person says: “If Allah delievers me I will give in charity,” then this is a promise that he has made to Allah and that he must fulfil, otherwise he will be included in the group mentioned in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So He punished them by putting hypocrisy into their hearts till the Day whereon they shall meet Him, because they broke that (covenant with Allah) which they had promised to Him and because they used to tell lies”
[al-Tawbah 9:77]
The promise that a person makes to his Lord is a vow that he must fulfil. The conditional vow is even more essential to fulfil than a vow in which a person says, “I will do such and such for Allah.” 
Breaking it will result in the punishment of hypocrisy in the heart. 
End quote. 
Secondly: 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) condemned those who made vows but did not fulfil them. Muslim (2535) narrated from ‘Imraan ibn Husayn that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of you are my generation, then those who follow them, then those who follow them, then those who follow them.” ‘Imraan said: I do not know whether the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “and those who follow them” two times or three. “Then after them will come people who will bear witness without being asked to do so, who will betray and not be trustworthy, who will make vows but not fulfil them, and fatness will appear among them.”  
Al-Nawawi said: 
This shows that it is obligatory to fulfil vows, and there is no dispute among the scholars concerning that.  
End quote. 
What is meant by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “and fatness will appear among them” is that these people will be negligent towards their religious affairs, and all they will care about is eating, drinking, relaxing and sleeping. The kind of fatness that is condemned is that which is acquired, not that which is the way a person is made. And Allah knows best. See ‘Awn al-Ma’bood, commentary on hadeeth no. 4657. 
Thirdly: 
Not fulfilling vows is one of the attributes of the hypocrites. 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And of them are some who made a covenant with Allah (saying): ‘If He bestowed on us of His Bounty, we will verily, give Sadaqah (Zakaah and voluntary charity in Allah’s Cause) and will be certainly among those who are righteous.’
Then when He gave them of His Bounty, they became niggardly [refused to pay the Sadaqah (Zakaah or voluntary charity)], and turned away, averse.
So He punished them by putting hypocrisy into their hearts till the Day whereon they shall meet Him, because they broke that (covenant with Allah) which they had promised to Him and because they used to tell lies.
Know they not that Allah knows their secret ideas, and their Najwa (secret counsels), and that Allah is the All-Knower of things unseen”
[al-Tawbah 9:75-78]
Fourthly: 
With regard to the punishment of one who does not fulfil the promise he made to Allah: 
There is the fear that Allah may punish him by instilling hypocrisy in his heart, so he will meet Allah as a hypocrite and will be one of the losers.
As Allah says in the verse quoted above (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So He punished them by putting hypocrisy into their hearts till the Day whereon they shall meet Him, because they broke that (covenant with Allah) which they had promised to Him and because they used to tell lies”
[al-Tawbah 9:77]
al-Sa’di said (p. 546): 
This means: among these hypocrites are those who made a covenant with Allah and said, “If He bestowed on us of His Bounty” in this world, granting us a life of ease and plenty, then “we will verily, give Sadaqah (Zakaah and voluntary charity in Allah’s Cause) and will be certainly among those who are righteous” and will uphold the ties of kinship and support the truth and do good deeds. 
Then “when He gave them of His Bounty”, they did not keep their promise, rather they “they became niggardly [refused to pay the Sadaqah (Zakaah or voluntary charity)], and turned away” from obedience and submission and were “averse” i.e., they had no interest in doing good. When they did not fulfil the promise that they had made to Allah, He punished them by “putting hypocrisy into their hearts” which will last “till the Day whereon they shall meet Him, because they broke that (covenant with Allah) which they had promised to Him and because they used to tell lies”. 
So let the believers beware of this evil characteristic whereby a person promises his Lord that if a certain hoped-for thing happens, he will do such and such, then he does not fulfil that promise, for Allah may punish him with hypocrisy just as He punished the people mentioned here. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, according to the hadeeth proven in al-Saheehayn: “The signs of the hypocrite are three: when he speaks, he lies; when he makes a covenant, he betrays it; and when he makes a promise, he breaks it.” 
This hypocrite who made a promise to Allah that if Allah gave him of His bounty he would give charity and be among the righteous, spoke and lied, make a covenant and betrayed it, and made a promise and broke it. Hence those who do such evil actions are addressed with the words (interpretation of the meaning): 
Know they not that Allah knows their secret ideas, and their Najwa (secret counsels), and that Allah is the All-Knower of things unseen”
[al-Tawbah 9:78]
Allah will recompense them for their deeds which are known to Him. 
And Allah knows best.",Islam Q&A
