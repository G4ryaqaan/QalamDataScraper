10301,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10301,The emergence of the Mahdi,Is it told in the Quran when the Mahdi will come to save the muslims? .,,,"Praise be to Allah.The Muslim must understand that evidence from both the Qur’aan and Sunnah are of the same level and must be followed equally. Both the Qur’aan and Sunnah are Revelation (Wahy) from Allah and must be followed. Allah says concerning His Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Nor does he speak of (his own) desire.
It is only a Revelation revealed” [al-Najm 53:4-3]
It was narrated from al-Miqdaam ibn Ma’dikarib that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Beware! I have been given the Qur’aan and something like it, yet the time is coming when a man replete on his couch will say: ‘Keep to the Qur’aan; what you find in it to be permissible treat as permissible, and what you find in it to be prohibited treat as prohibited.’” 
(Narrated by Abu Dawood, 4606; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani – may Allah have mercy on him – in Saheeh Sunan Abi Dawood, 3848). 
Secondly: 
Allah has enjoined that His Messenger is to be obeyed independently of the Qur’aan. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger (Muhammad), and those of you (Muslims) who are in authority” [al-Nisa’ 4:59]
“And whatsoever the Messenger (Muhammad) gives you, take it; and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it)” [al-Hashr 59:7]
Thirdly: 
It is not narrated in either the Qur’aan or the Sunnah precisely when the Mahdi will emerge, but he will emerge at the end of time. However we must point out the following: 
1-The emergence of the Mahdi will be one of the last minor signs of the Hour.
2- Many people claimed that the Mahdi has emerged or will emerge to support their personal aims and misguided beliefs, such as the Qadianis (Ahmadis), Baha’is, Shi’ah and other deviant groups. This has led some later scholars to reject the ahaadeeth which speak of the Mahdi or to misinterpret them by saying that what is meant by the Mahdi is the descent of ‘Eesa ibn Maryam (Jesus son of Mary – peace be upon him) at the end of time. Some of them quote a hadeeth that is attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) which says, “There is no Mahdi apart from ‘Eesa ibn Maryam.”
This hadeeth is da’eef (weak) and cannot be soundly attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). See al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah, 1/175, by al-Albaani  (may Allah have mercy on him).
3-Many scholars have written books confirming that the Mahdi will emerge, and describing that as part of the belief (‘aqeedah) of the Muslim. For example: al-Haafiz Abu Na’eem, Abu Dawood, Abu Katheer, al-Sakhaawi, al-Shawkaani, and others.
4-It is proven in the Sunnah that the Mahdi will meet ‘Eesa ibn Maryam (peace be upon him) and that ‘Eesa will pray behind him.
Muslim (156) narrated that Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say, ‘A group of my ummah will continue to fight for the truth and prevail until the Day of Resurrection. Then ‘Eesa ibn Maryam will come down and their leader will say, “Come and lead us in prayer.” But he will say, “No, you are leaders of one another” – as an honour to this ummah.’”
The leader mentioned in this hadeeth is the Mahdi. According to a report narrated by Abu Na’eem and al-Haarith ibn Usaamah, “Their leader the Mahdi will say…” Ibn al-Qayyim said, “Its isnaad is jayyid (good).”
5-The Muslim should not wait for the emergence of the Mahdi, rather he has to strive hard and devote his efforts to support Islam, and to do whatever he can for the religion. He should not hope and wait for the emergence of the Mahdi or anyone else, rather he should correct himself, his family and the people around him, so that when he meets Allah he meet Him having done his best.

(Narrated by Muslim, al-Hayd, 461)
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’: “It seems to me that the one who is junub should not sleep without doing wudu , this is mustahabb, as is also the case with regard to eating and drinking.

10323,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10323,Rulings on seizing things wrongfully,What is the ruling on taking another person’s property wrongfully (ghasb)?,,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          Ghasb in Arabic means to seize 
          something wrongfully. In Fiqh terminology, it means taking the property 
          of others wrongfully, by force.
 
           Ghasb is haraam according 
          to the consensus of the Muslims, because Allaah says (interpretation 
          of the meaning): 
 
          “And eat up not one another’s 
          property unjustly (in any illegal way, e.g. stealing, robbing, deceiving”
 
          [al-Baqarah 2:188]
 Ghasb 
          is one of the worst kinds of eating up another person’s property unjustly, 
          because the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)  said: “Your blood, 
          your property and your honour are sacred to you.” And he 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The property of a 
          Muslim is not permissible unless he gives his consent.” 
 
          The property that is seized by 
          force may be real estate or it may be moveable goods, because the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever seizes a 
          handspan of land unlawfully, will surround him to the depth of seven 
          earths.”  
 
          The one who has seized anything 
          unlawfully must repent to Allaah and return the seized property to its 
          owner and ask him for forgiveness. The Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever has done 
          any wrong to his brother, let him seek his forgiveness today, before 
          there will be no dinar and no dirham [i.e., the Day of Resurrection], 
          when if he has any hasanaat (good deeds), some of his hasanaat will 
          be taken and given to the one who was wronged, and if he  does 
          not have any hasanaat, some of the sayi’aat (bad deeds) of the one who 
          was wronged will be taken and thrown onto him, and he will be thrown 
          into Hell,” or as he 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)  said it. If the seized 
          property is still there, it should be returned as it is, and if it is 
          not there, then he must replace it.  
 
          Imaam al-Muwaffaq said: “The scholars 
          agreed that it is obligatory to return the seized property if it is 
          still in its original condition and has not changed.” 
 
          Similarly, he is obliged to return 
          the seized property along with any increase, whether it is connected 
          to it or separate, because that is the growth of the seized property, 
          so it also belongs to the original owner. 
 
          If the one who seized the property 
          has built anything or planted crops on the seized land, he has to remove 
          the buildings or crops if the owner asks him to, because the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “The sweat of the 
          evildoer counts for nothing.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi and others; classed 
          as hasan). If that has caused any damage to the land, he is to be penalized 
          for that damage. He also has to erase any traces of building or planting 
          that remain, so that the land may be given back to its owner in good 
          condition. 
 
          He also has to pay rent covering 
          the period from the time when he seized the land to the time when he 
          gave it back, - i.e., the rent for a similar piece of land – because 
          he unlawfully prevented its owner from benefiting from it during this 
          time. 
 
          If he seized something and kept 
          it until the price dropped, he has to make it up to the proper price, 
          according to the correct opinion. 
 
          If he mixed the seized property 
          with something else that can be told apart from it – like mixing wheat 
          with barley – the one who seized it has separate it and return it .  
          If he mixed it with something that cannot be told apart from it – such 
          as mixing wheat with wheat – then he has to give back the equivalent, 
          by volume or weight, without mixing it. If he mixed it with something 
          the same or better, or he mixed it with something different that cannot 
          be told apart from it, then the mixture should be sold and each of them 
          should take his share of the price, in proportion. If the value of the 
          seized goods is reduced in this fashion, and it sells for less than 
          what it would be sold for if sold on its own, then the one who seized 
          it has to make up the loss. 
 
          The scholars also mentioned regarding 
          this topic that “all hands involved in seizing property by force are 
          responsible and must guarantee its return.” This means that all hands 
          which received the seized property from the one who seized it must all 
          guarantee to replace the property if it is damaged or destroyed. These 
          hands number ten: the hand of the one who buys it etc.; the hand of 
          the one who rents it; the hand of the one who takes it in order to possess 
          it without paying anything in return, such as one who receives it as 
          a gift; the hand of the one who obtains it to serve the interests of 
          one who is paying him, such as an agent; the hand of the one who borrows 
          it; the hand of the one who seizes it by force unlawfully; the hand 
          of the one who has it under his control such as one who seeks to use 
          it for trade; the hand of the one who marries a woman who was seized 
          by force  ; the hand of the one who takes it in return for something 
          without any financial transaction being involved; and the hand of the 
          one who destroys the seized property on behalf of the one who seized 
          it.  
 
          In each of these cases, if the 
          second person knows the truth of the matter, and that the one who is 
          giving it to him is the one who seized it unlawfully, then he is also 
          responsible for replacing it, because he transgressed when he knew that 
          there was no permission from the owner of the property. If he did not 
          know the truth of the matter, then only one who seized it in the first 
          place is responsible for replacing it. 
 
          If the seized property is of a 
          type that is usually rented out, then the one who seized it has to pay 
          rent for property of that type for the period during which he kept it, 
          because the benefit is something that is to be measured in monetary 
          terms, so he has to repay that as well as returning the property itself. 
 
          All of the ways in which the one 
          who seized the property has disposed of it are null and void, because 
          he did not have the permission of the owner. 
 
          If something is seized and the 
          owner is not known, and it cannot be returned to him, then he should 
          hand it over to the governor who can restore it to its rightful place, 
          or he can give it in charity on behalf of its owner; if he gives it 
          in charity then the reward for that will go to the owner. In this manner 
          the one who seized it wrongfully may be absolved. 
 
          Wrongful seizure of property is 
          not restricted only to taking it by force; it may also include taking 
          it by way of false dispute or false oaths. Allaah says (interpretation 
          of the meaning):
 
          “And 
          eat up not one another’s property unjustly (in any illegal way, e.g. 
          stealing, robbing, deceiving), nor give bribery to the rulers (judges 
          before presenting your cases) that you may knowingly eat up a part of 
          the property of others sinfully”
 
          [al-Baqarah 2:188]
 
          The matter is serious and the 
          reckoning will be severe. 
 
          The Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever seizes a 
          handspan of land unlawfully, will surround him to the depth of seven 
          earths.”
 
           And he 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
 
           “If I decide in a person’s 
          favour mistakenly concerning that which is his brother’s right, let 
          him not take it, for I am giving him a piece of fire.”",From al-Mulakhkhas al-Fiqhi by Shaykh Saalih ibn Fawzaan ibn ‘Abd-Allaah Aal Fawzaan p:130

9 – Choosing companions


10 – Finally, good manners towards the shaykh","Praise be to Allah.Etiquettes of the seeker of knowledge
There is a certain amount of etiquette for seeking knowledge which the seeker of knowledge should follow. We will give you this advice and this etiquette for seeking knowledge ; may Allah cause you to benefit thereby.
1 – Patience
My dear brother, seeking knowledge is one of the highest of pursuits, and heights cannot be scaled except by working hard and striving. Abu Tamaam said, addressing himself:
“Let me scale the heights that cannot be scaled, for reaching high things is difficult whilst reaching low things is easy.
You want to scale the heights without any effort, but honey cannot be gathered without bee stings.”
Another poet said:
“You seek to attain glory, and those who seek to attain glory
Strive their utmost and roll up their sleeves for that purpose.
They strive hard but most of them become tired.
But those who have patience and perseverance attain the heights of the glory that they desired.
Do not think that attaining glory is as easy as eating dates;
You cannot attain glory until you swallow the bitterest medicine.”
So be patient and persevere. If jihaad requires an hour of patience, then the seeker of knowledge must be patient until the end of his life. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning)
“O you who believe! Endure and be more patient (than your enemy), and guard your territory by stationing army units permanently at the places from where the enemy can attack you, and fear Allâh, so that you may be successful.” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:200]
2 – Purity of intention in action
Adhere to purity of intention in what you do. Let your aim be to seek the Face of Allah (i.e., the pleasure of Allah) and the Home of the Hereafter. Beware of showing off and the love of making oneself appear to be superior to one’s peers. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever seeks knowledge in order to compete with the scholars or to prove himself superior to the ignorant or to make the people look up to him, Allah will cause him to enter Hell.” (narrated by al-Nasaa’i, 2654; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Nasaa’i).
To sum up, you have to be pure both outwardly and inwardly from every major and minor sin.
3 – Acting upon what you know
Know that acting upon what you know is the fruit of knowledge. Whoever knows but does not act upon his knowledge is like the Jews whom Allah likened to the ugliest things in His Book, when He said (interpretation of the meaning):
“The likeness of those who were entrusted with the (obligation of the) Tawraat (Torah) (i.e. to obey its commandments and to practise its laws), but who subsequently failed in those (obligations), is as the likeness of a donkey which carries huge burdens of books (but understands nothing from them). How bad is the example of people who deny the Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allah. And Allah guides not the people who are Zaalimoon (polytheists, wrongdoers, disbelievers)” [al-Jumu’ah 62:5]
And whoever acts without knowledge is like the Christians, who are the “daalleen (those who have gone astray)” mentioned in Soorat al-Faatihah. With regard to the books which you should study, they are mentioned in Question # 20191 ; please refer to this Question as it is important.
4 – Always being aware that Allah is watching
You must always be aware that Allah is watching you, in secret and in the open. Your attitude towards your Lord must always be balanced between fear and hope, which for the Muslims are like the two wings of a bird. Turn to Allah wholeheartedly and let your heart be filled with love for Him, your tongue with remembrance of Him (dhikr). Be happy and rejoice in His rulings and His wisdom.
Always call upon Allah (du’aa’) in every sujood, asking Him to bless you and grant you beneficial knowledge, for if you are sincere towards Allah, He will support you and help you, and will cause you to attain the level of the righteous scholars.
5 – Make the best use of time
Make the most of your youth and your whole life by learning. Do not be deceived by procrastination and wishful thinking about the future. Every hour of your life that passes cannot be replaced. Do away with whatever you can of distractions and obstacles which prevent you from striving your utmost to attain knowledge. Hence the salaf encouraged keeping away from one’s family and keeping a distance from one’s homeland, because when a person is distracted he will not be able to understand facts of knowledge and subtle issues. Allah has not given man two hearts in his chest, and similarly it is said that knowledge will not give you a part of it until you give it your all.
6 – Be cautious
Beware of being preoccupied in the beginning with the disputes among the scholars, or among people in general, because this confuses the mind. Also beware of musannafaat , because they will waste your time and make you confused. Instead, give your all to the book which you are reading or the topic which you are studying until you become competent in it. Beware of moving from one book to another (before completing the former), for that is a sign of boredom and failure. You must pay attention to each branch of knowledge, in order of importance.
7 – Precision and focus
Strive to verify that which you want to memorize so that you are certain of it, either from a shaykh or from someone else who can help you. Then memorize it properly and continually repeat it and review at specific times each day, lest you forget what you have memorized.
8 – Studying books
After you have memorized the summarized books properly, with their commentaries, and you have understood any difficult passages in them and understood the important points, then move on to studying the detailed versions, always reviewing what you have learned and noting the valuable points, subtle issues, strange minor issues, solutions to problems and differences between similar rulings, in all branches of knowledge. Do not think little of anything useful that you learn or any basic principle that you understand; instead, hasten to note and memorize it.
Let your concern to seek knowledge be uppermost; do not be content to learn only a little when you are able to do more. Do not be content with a little of the legacy of the Prophets (may the blessings of Allah be upon them), and do not delay learning anything that you can, or be distracted or put off by wishful thinking. Delay is a problem, and if you learn something now you can learn something else later.
Make the most of your time, when you are free and when you are busy. Make the most of your youth when your mind is fresh and you have less distractions, before you become distracted by false ambitions and the desire for worldly possessions.
You should try to obtain as many of the books you need as you can, because they are the tools of learning. Do not make getting and keeping a lot of them (without benefiting from them) the only share of knowledge that you have, and collecting them the only share of understanding that you have. You also have to use and benefit from them as much as you can.
9 – Choosing companions
Strive to choose righteous friends who are preoccupied with seeking knowledge and are of a good nature, who can help you in achieving your aim, add to the benefits you have already gained, encourage you to seek more knowledge and stop you from feeling bored and tired; friends who are religiously-committed, trustworthy and of good character, who are sincere towards Allah and who are not merely messing about. (See Tadhkirat al-Saami’ by Ibn Jamaa’aah).
Beware of the bad companion, for he may influence you and people are like birds, they will resemble one another [i.e., “birds of a feather flock together”]. So beware of mixing with people like that, for that is a sickness, and prevention is better than cure.
10 – Finally, good manners towards the shaykh
Knowledge cannot be gained only from books; you must also have a shaykh whom you trust to open the door to knowledge and keep you from making mistakes. So you must have good manners towards him, for this is the way to success, learning and strength. So you must honour, respect and be polite to the shaykh. Observe the utmost standards of etiquette when you sit with your shaykh and speak with him. Ask questions in a proper manner and listen attentively. Be polite when studying the book with him and do not try to argue with him or compete with him. Do not initiate conversation with him or walk ahead of him or speak too much in his presence, or interrupt him or interrupt him when he is teaching. Do not pressurize him to give you an answer, and avoid asking him too many questions, especially in front of other people, for this will make you appear to be showing off and make him bored with you. Do not call him directly by his name or nickname; rather say “O my shaykh” or “O our shaykh” (Yaa shaykhi or Yaa shaykhanaa)
If you think that the shaykh has made a mistake, do not let that make him lose respect in your eyes, because that will deprive you of his knowledge. Who is there who is entirely free from error? See Hilyat Taalib al-‘Ilm by Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd
We ask Allah to make you and us strong and steadfast, and to let us see the day when you will become one of the scholars of the Muslims and an authority in the religion of Allah and one of the imaams of the pious.  Ameen, ameen.. We hope to meet soon, and peace be upon you.

10326,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10326,TV and movie pictures and video pictures,"I have a question regarding pictures -Are pictures that are manafactured through means such as video, computers etc.
(i.e. they come on and off the screen)permissable? Can you please verify this with proof and evidence?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The ruling on a thing depends on the way in which it is perceived. It is essential to know how the picture-making you refer to is done. The author of Risaalat Ahkaam al-Tasweer (The ruling on picture-making) said: 
    1.Movie pictures or pictures on a cinema film: 
This is a method which transmits moving pictures with sound for a limited time span, showing all the events that happened within this time frame. The picture which is shown by the film on the screen is the shadow or reflection of that thing, not its real essence, after it has been recorded on the film. It says in al-Sharee’ah al-Islamiyyah wa’l-Funoon (Islamic sharee’ah and the Arts) that the cinema is called [in Arabic] akhyaliyyah [from khayaal, meaning shadow or dim reflection], “because it shows the shadows of things, not their real essence.” 
2 – TV pictures 
This is a method which transmits pictures and sounds at the same time via an electrical impulse. This is the result of the effect of light from the object whose picture is being taken being reflected on a mica sheet which is covered with a vast number of tiny particles made of photosensitive material, manufactured from silver oxide and caesium, of which the particles are separated from one another and isolated electrically. 
This kind of image-making using machines is very similar to the image on a movie film, but in TV pictures, the images are changed to electronic signals, then to electromagnetic waves, which are then either sent via antennas to be picked up by the receiving apparatus in TV sets, within the range that the signal can reach, or they are sent to be stored in the form of magnetic changes on plastic tapes that have been plated with the appropriate magnetic substance that can store these waves. 
In order to show what has been recorded on these tapes after these waves have been stored, it has to pass through a machine which transforms it once more into electronic signals then sends it to a screen in the form of electrical signals, so that it appears as a picture, but only after a complex operation. 
The TV set is the equipment which receives the electrical waves and gathers them, then transmits them in a regulated manner in the form of a picture with complete features. 
There is another kind which is considered to be similar to this kind of image-making. This is something similar to the telephone which is used in some industrially-advanced countries, which transmits both the voice and the image of the speaker, so both parties can see one another on the screen of the device on which they are talking. 
Similarly, there are cameras which are installed at the doors of houses. This system picks up the voice and image of the person who is coming to the house and transmits it to a screen inside the house, so that whoever is inside the house can see it clearly. And similarly there is equipment which is used to watch out for criminals stealing and so on in banks, stores, etc. 
These kinds of equipment are considered to be of one kind, but are used for a variety of purposes, whereby the camera covers the area which is to be watched over, and it transmits the images to a screen like a TV, where the image appears clearly. New things are appearing all the time, and we do not know what will appear in the future. If this indicates anything, it indicates the mind-boggling expansion of the use of machines to make images of both kinds, both still and moving, in many areas, including manufacturing, war, security, education, medicine, social, etc. 
Ahkaam al-Tasweer by Ahmad ibn ‘Ali Waasil, p. 65-67 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: 
With regard to pictures made in the modern fashion, they fall into two categories: 
The first category is those which have no tangible substance (and can only be seen by running them through a machine), as I was told is the case with pictures on video tapes. There is no ruling at all concerning these, and they do not come under the prohibition at all. Hence the scholars who forbid making pictures with cameras on paper (photographs) permitted this (video pictures), and said that there is nothing wrong with this. Then it was asked, is it permissible to film lectures which are given in the mosques? The (scholarly) view was that it is better not to do that, because it may disturb the worshippers and because they may film things that may not be appropriate, and so on. 
The second category is fixed or still pictures on paper (photographs) … 
But the matter needs further discussion if one wants to make these kind of permissible pictures. For they are subject to five rulings which depend on the intention. If the intention is something forbidden, then it is haraam. If he intends something waajib (obligatory), then it is waajib. Sometimes pictures may be essential, especially moving pictures. For example, if we see someone in the act of committing a crime against a person’s rights, such as an attempt to kill and so on, and we cannot prove it in any way but by taking pictures, then in this case taking pictures becomes waajib, especially in cases where pictures may decide the case. The means are subject to the rulings on the ends. If we make these pictures in order to prove the identity of a person for fear that someone else may be accused of the crime, this is also acceptable, indeed it is essential. 
But if we take these pictures just to enjoy looking at them, this is undoubtedly haram... And Allah knows best.” (See Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 2/197-199)",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
10329,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10329,"Meaning of the Hadeeth, “Faith retreats to Madeenah”","What is the meaning of the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “Faith retreats to Madeenah like a snake returns to its hole”?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    In this 
    hadeeth, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Faith 
    retreats to Madeenah like a snake returns to its hole.” The word “retreats 
    to” means to return and settle in Madeenah, just as a snake, when it goes 
    out from its hole, returns to it. Here the Prophet (peace and blessings of 
    Allah be upon him) was saying that this religion will retreat to Madeenah 
    after all other countries become corrupt, just as a snake comes out of its 
    hole and wanders about the land, then it goes back to its hole.  
    

    This 
    hadeeth also indicates that just as Islam spread from Madeenah, it will 
    return to it. Islam with its strength and authority spread from Madeenah, 
    although its roots stemmed from Makkah. Makkah was the place where the first 
    Revelation came down, but the Muslims did not have a state and power, and 
    engage in jihad (battle), until after they migrated to Madeenah. Hence Islam 
    with its power and authority, spread from Madeenah and will retreat to it at 
    the end of time.  

    Some of 
    the scholars said: this hadeeth refers to something that has already 
    happened, i.e., the people came in delegations to Madeenah and went back 
    there again to learn about sharee’ah (Islamic law) and the teachings of 
    Islam from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon 
    him). But the first meaning is the apparent meaning of the hadeeth and is 
    more correct.","Majmoo’ Fatawa wa Rasail Fadeelat al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-‘Uthaymeen, vol. 1, p. 55"
10332,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10332,Is it permissible to pay off the debt of a son who is in need when one has other children?,"I know that it is obligatory to treat one's children fairly, but one of my children is poor and has debts. Is it permissible for me to pay off some of his debts from my own money?",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is obligatory to treat 
    one's children fairly. See Question no. 22169. 
It is obligatory to treat 
    children equally in gift-giving and it is forbidden to single some out for 
    gifts or to show preferences, unless there is a compelling reason for doing 
    so. 
If there is a reason to 
    show preference to one or to single one out, then it is acceptable to do so, 
    such as if one of them is sick, blind or disabled, or he has a large family, 
    or he is a student, and other reasons. So in that case it is acceptable to 
    give him preference for those reasons. 
Imaam Ahmad referred to 
    that when he said – concerning singling out some of one's children to be 
    beneficiaries of a waqf – “There is nothing wrong with that if it is because 
    of a need, but I regard it as makrooh if it is by way of showing 
    favouritism.” 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn 
    Taymiyah said: “The hadeeth and the reports indicate that it is obligatory 
    to treat children fairly… but there are two kinds: 
1 – Those who need him to 
    spend on them in sickness and in health and so on, in which case fairness 
    means giving each of them what he needs, and it makes no difference if he 
    needs a little or a lot. 
2 – Needs which all the 
    children will have in common, such as gifts, maintenance and arranging their 
    marriages. Undoubtedly it is haraam to show preferences with regard to these 
    matters.
From these two stems a third kind, which is helping out one child for an extraordinary need, such as paying off the debt of one child, or paying compensation on his behalf (if he has caused injury to another), or paying the mahr on his behalf, or giving him the money he needs for his wife’s maintenance, and so on. Concerning whether or not he is obligated to give a similar amount to the other children is subject to further discussion.” (From al-Ikhtiyaaraat)","Tayseer al-‘Allaam Sharh ‘Umdat al-Ahkaam, p. 767"

He has to migrate from it, even if that means going against and disobeying his parents, because obedience to Allah takes priority, and obedience to parents is only with regard to good matters. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Obedience is only with regard to good things” and “There is no obedience to any created being if it involves disobedience to the Creator.” If a person cannot practise his religion openly or is forced to commit sin in any country, he has to migrate from that country.","Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah li Samaahat al-Shaykh al-‘Allaamah ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him), vol. 8, p. 278"

-- Fish is halal in all circumstances, because its being halal does not depend on how it is slaughtered or whether the name of Allah is mentioned over it.
-- With regard to other kinds of meat, if those who slaughter it – companies or individuals – are from the People of the Book, Jews or Christians, and it is known that they do not kill the animals by means of electric shocks, strangulation or blows to the head, as is known in the West, then the meat is permissible. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Made lawful to you this day are At-Tayyibaat [all kinds of halal (lawful) foods, which Allah has made lawful (meat of slaughtered eatable animals, milk products, fats, vegetables and fruits)]. The food (slaughtered cattle, eatable animals) of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) is lawful to you and yours is lawful to them” [al-Maa’idah 5:5]
But if they kill the animals by means of some of these methods (electric shocks, etc), then the meat is haram, because in that case the animals are counted as having been killed by strangling or by a violent blow (cf. Al-Maa’idah 5:3). If those who slaughter the meat are not Jews or Christians, then the meat that they offer is haram. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Eat not (O believers) of that (meat) on which Allah’s Name has not been pronounced (at the time of the slaughtering of the animal), for sure it is Fisq (a sin and disobedience of Allah)” [al-A’naam 6:121]

This hadeeth was narrated 
          by Imaam al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) in his Saheeh, 
          from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar, who said: “The Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) led us in praying ‘Ishaa 
          towards the end of his life. When he had said the salaam, he 
          stood up and said: ‘Do you see this night of yours? One hundred years 
          from now, there will not be anyone left of those who are on the face 
          of the earth.’”
There follow some comments 
          made by Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) on this hadeeth:
“Led us in prayer” means as 
          an imaam. 
“Towards the end of his life”. A corroborating 
          report narrated by Jaabir states that this was one month before he  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) died. 
“Do you see” means, “Think about (this 
          night).” 
“One hundred years from now” means, when 
          one hundred years have passed. 
“There will not be anyone left of those 
          who are on the face of the earth” means, anyone who was alive at that 
          time.
Ibn Battaal said: What the 
          Messenger  (peace and blessings 
          of Allaah be upon him) meant was that during this time-span their generation 
          would pass away. He was pointing out to them how short their lives were 
          and that their lives were not like those of the nations who came before 
          them, so that they would strive hard in worship.
Al-Nawawi said: What is meant 
          is that everyone who was on the face of the earth on that night would 
          not live for more than one hundred years after that night, whether he 
          was young on that occasion or not. It does not mean that anyone who 
          was born after that night would not live for a hundred years. And Allaah 
          knows best.
This hadeeth is one of the 
          signs of the Prophethood of the Prophet

          events which came to pass as he described them. The trustworthy scholars

I have divided journalists into three categories: those who are well-versed in deviant thought; those who are no more than an echo but do not really understand anything; and the ordinary kind who are not influenced by any ideology at all. The purpose of that is to guide those journalists who have gone astray. I have sent letters to a few of them, and I have had good and promising results, praise be to Allaah – especially from the women. This is by the grace of Allaah.

In my tradition people come to pay condolences By saying sorry to her about your loss etc after which they ask everyone present to raise their hands and say Fatihah and maybe darud also.
From my knowledge I have heard that this may be a Bi`ah, and I took the general rule that whatever is in life is permissible unless it has been made prohibited and whatever is in the religion is prohibited unless it's been made permissible. Thus not knowing what one is supposed to do i tried my best to stay away from doing anything which i had no knowledge of ering the body and putting the soil
4 can one place a mark or name on a rock etc at the grave
5 And after completion of putting the soil what Du`a if any should one say (because even in jannat al mualla ,after we had buried my father the workers at the graveyard had one worker making Du`a with raised hands and the others saying amin, is this allowed?)

How to offer condolences in Islam


What to avoid when offering condolences?","Praise be to Allah.Carrying the deceased and following the funeral
It is obligatory to carry the deceased and follow the funeral. This is one of the rights that the dead Muslim has over the Muslims, which will bring great reward and virtue to the one who does it. 
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever attends the funeral from the house (of the deceased) [according to one report: whoever follows the funeral of a Muslim out of faith and the hope of reward] until the funeral prayer is offered will have one Qirat, and whoever attends the funeral until the deceased is buried will have two Qirats.” He was asked, “O Messenger of Allah, what are the two Qirats?” He said, “Like two huge mountains.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, Al-Jana’iz, 1240).
It is not permitted to follow funerals in manners that go against the Shari`ah. That includes:

Crying or weeping in a loud voice; 
Following it with incense (Bukhur) etc.; 
Reciting Dhikr in a loud voice in front of the coffin as it is being carried, because that is Bid’ah. Qays ibn `Abbad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to regard it as disliked to raise the voice in front of the coffin” – and because it is an imitation of the Christians. 

How to bury the deceased in Islam
Muslims should not be buried with the disbelievers, nor the disbelievers with Muslims. The Muslim should be buried in the Muslim graveyard.  
The Sunnah is to put the deceased into the grave from the end, then he should be turned onto his right side in the grave, with his face directed towards the Qiblah . The one who puts him into the Lahd  should say, “Bismillahi wa ‘ala sunnat Rasul-Allahi or ‘ala millat Rasul-Allahi (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) (In the name of Allah and according to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah or according to the religion of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)).” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, Al-Jana’iz 967; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Sunan Abu Dawud, 836) 
It is recommended for those who are at the grave to throw handfuls of earth, three handfuls scooped up in both hands, after the Lahd has been sealed.
What to do after the burial?
After the burial is complete, there are several things which are Sunnah: 

To make the grave a little higher than the ground, approximately a handspan, and not to make it level with the ground, so that it may be distinguished as a grave and respected, and not subjected to disrespect. It should be made approximately a handspan higher than the ground, and there is nothing wrong with placing a marker such as a stone or something similar, so that others of his family may be buried near him later on. Water should be sprinkled on the grave so that the soil will settle and not fly around.
No one should stand by the grave telling the deceased that he will be questioned soon etc., as is the custom among some people.
Rather people should stand at the grave and pray for the deceased to be made steadfast and for forgiveness for him. Those who are present should be told to do this, because of the Hadith of `Uthman ibn `Affan (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: “When the deceased had been buried, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would stand by (the grave) and say: ‘Pray for forgiveness for your brother and ask for him to be made steadfast, for even now he is being questioned .’” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, Al-Jana’iz, 2804; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Sunan Abu Dawood, 2758) 
Nothing of the Quran should be recited at the graveside, because this is Bid`ah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not do this, and neither did his noble Companions. 
It is prohibited to build up graves or to plaster them or to write anything on them, because Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade us to plaster graves with gypsum, to sit on them or to build anything over them.” (Narrated by Muslim, Al-Jana’iz, 1610. According to Abu Dawud,  “He forbade us  to plaster graves with gypsum, to write on them or to step on them.” (Al-Jana’iz, 3226. Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Sunan Abu Dawud, 2763) 

How to offer condolences in Islam
It is prescribed in Islam to offer condolences to the family of the deceased. This should take the form of whatever is thought will bring them consolation, stem their grief and help them to be patient. 
Condolences should be offered in the manner reported from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) if one can remember that, otherwise use good words that come naturally which achieve the same purpose and align with Islamic principles. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “To Allah belongs that which He has taken and that which He gives, and with Him everything has an appointed end, so be patient and seek reward.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, Al-Jana’iz, 1204) 
What to avoid when offering condolences?
Two things must be avoided:

Gathering to offer condolences, even though the people do that.
The family of the deceased preparing food to offer to those who come to offer condolences.

The Sunnah is for the relatives and neighbours of the deceased to make food enough for the bereaved family.

10374,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10374,Bus driver being alone with a woman,"There are many women who attend courses in one of the centers for memorization of Qur’aan, and there is a bus that picks them up and drops them off, and the driver has no mahram with him such as his wife. The question is, with regard to the first female passenger in the morning and the last female passenger in the afternoon, is their being in the bus regarded as the kind of khulwah (being alone with a member of the opposite sex) that is haraam?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.There are many fatwas from scholars which say 
    that it is forbidden for a driver to be alone with a non-mahram woman, because of the text which states that it is haraam to be alone with a 
    non-mahram woman, and because of the obvious evil consequences to which that may lead, whether one is going to a center for memorizing Qur’aan or 
    to a mosque, so the prohibition is even stronger when going to the marketplace etc. This ruling has to do – as mentioned in the question – with 
    the first female passenger in the morning and the last female passenger in the afternoon. In order to avoid any problem, there should be two 
    female passengers who get on together first in the morning, and two who get off together last in the afternoon. There follow some of the fatwas of 
    the scholars: 
Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem (may Allaah 
    have mercy on him) said: 
There can be no doubt that if a non-mahram 
    woman travels with a driver without a mahram to accompany her, this is obviously wrong and involves a number of evils which are not insignificant. 
    The man who approves of this for his mahrams (female relatives) is lacking in religious commitment and manhood, and he has little protective 
    jealousy (gheerah) towards his mahrams. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “No man is alone with a non-mahram 
    woman but the Shaytaan is the third one present.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2165; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani, 1758).  For her to ride with 
    him in a car is more serious than being alone with him in a house etc, because he can take her wherever he wants in the city or outside the city, 
    whether she agrees to that or goes unwillingly, and there may result from that evils far worse than simply being alone with her. 
The fitnah (temptation) posed by women and 
    the evil things that result from that are well known. According to the hadeeth, “I have not left behind me any fitnah more harmful for men than 
    women.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5096; Muslim, 2740). According to another hadeeth: “Beware of this world and beware of women, for the first 
    fitnah of the Children of Israel was because of women.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2742) 
Because of this and other similar reports, 
    and because of what is in the public interest and what is required of us by our religion, we think that we should definite in not allowing any 
    non-mahram woman to ride with a taxi driver unless she is accompanied by one of her mahrams or people who could take the place of a mahram or a 
    trustworthy person who is connected to her mahram. 
Fataawa al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah, 
    2/553, 554 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah 
    have mercy on him) 
It is not permissible for a woman to travel 
    with a driver who is not her mahram when there is no one else with them, because this comes under the ruling on khulwah (being alone with a member 
    of the opposite sex). It was narrated that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No man should be alone 
    with a (non-mahram) woman unless her mahram is also present.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5233; Muslim, 1341). The Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) said: “No man should ever be alone with a non-mahram woman because the Shaytaan will be the third one present.”
 But if there is one or more other men 
    present, or one or more other women, then there is nothing wrong with that, because there is nothing dubious in this case, since there is no 
    khulwah when there are three or more people present. 
This has to do with situations that are not 
    regarded as travelling [i.e., journeys within one’s city or town etc]. With regard to travelling, it is not permissible for a woman to travel 
    without a mahram, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No woman should travel without a mahram.” (Saheeh – 
    agreed upon). 
It makes no difference whether the travel is 
    by land, by air or by sea. And Allaah is the Source of strength.
Fataawa al-Mar’ah 
    al-Muslimah, 2/556 
Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen 
    said: 
It is not permissible for a man to be alone 
    with a woman in a car unless he is her mahram, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No man should be alone 
    with a (non-mahram) woman unless her mahram is also present.” 
But if there are two or more women with him, 
    that is o.k., because there is no khulwah in this case, so long as he is trustworthy and they are not travelling. And Allaah is the Source of 
    strength.
Fataawa al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah, 
    2/554, 555 
Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan (may Allaah preserve 
    him) said: 
It is not permissible for a woman to travel 
    in a car on her own with a driver who is not her mahram, whether she is going to the mosque or anywhere else, because of the stern prohibition 
    against a man being alone with a woman whom he is not permitted to be with. 
But if there is a group of women with the 
    driver, then the matter is less serious, because this is not the khulwah which is forbidden. But they must observe proper etiquette and modesty, 
    and not joke or chat with the driver, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“then be not soft in speech, lest he in 
    whose heart is a disease (of hypocrisy, or evil desire for adultery) should be moved with desire, but speak in an honourable manner”

This is indicated by the following: 
1 – The story that Allaah tells us of two of His noble Prophets, namely Nooh and Loot (peace be upon them), whose wives were disbelievers. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allaah sets forth an example for those who disbelieve: the wife of Nooh (Noah) and the wife of Loot (Lot). They were under two of our righteous slaves, but they both betrayed them (their husbands by rejecting their doctrine). So they [Nooh (Noah) and Loot (Lot)] availed them (their respective wives) not against Allaah and it was said: ‘Enter the Fire along with those who enter!’”
[al-Tahreem 66:10]
2 – Islam does not allow an adulterer to marry a chaste woman, and it does not allow a chaste man to marry an adulteress. This indicates that such a thing could happen, and indeed it happens often. 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The adulterer — fornicator marries not but an adulteress — fornicatress or a Mushrikah; and the adulteress –fornicatress, none marries her except an adulterer — fornicater or a Mushrik [and that means that the man who agrees to marry (have a sexual relation with) a Mushrikah (female polytheist, pagan or idolatress) or a prostitute, then surely, he is either an adulterer — fornicator, or a Mushrik (polytheist, pagan or idolater). And the woman who agrees to marry (have a sexual relation with) a Mushrik (polytheist, pagan or idolater) or an adulterer — fornicator, then she is either a prostitute or a Mushrikah (female polytheist, pagan, or idolatress)]. Such a thing is forbidden to the believers (of Islamic Monotheism)”
[al-Noor 24:3] 
3 – The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said that a woman may be married for her wealth, her beauty, her lineage or her religious commitment, and the fact that he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) encouraged marrying the one who is religiously-committed indicates that marriages could occur for other reasons, so a man might marry a woman who is not like him.  
It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Woman are married for four things: for their wealth, their lineage, their beauty and their religious commitment. Marry the one who is religiously-committed, may your hands be rubbed with dust (i.e., may you prosper).” 
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4802; Muslim, 1466). 
4 – The fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded guardians to marry the women under their care to religiously-committed men indicates that something other than that could happen. 
It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If there comes to you one with whose religious commitment and character you are pleased, then marry (your daughter or other female relative under your care) to him, for if you do not do that there will be tribulation in the land and much corruption.” 
Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1084; Ibn Maajah, 1967. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 1022. 
So the one who is looking for a wife should look for one who is religiously-committed and has a good character; similarly, woman’s guardians should not marry them to anyone but those who are religiously-committed. For a man is influenced by those with whom he keeps company, especially if that lasts for a long time. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “A man will follow the way of his close friend, so let each of you look at whom he takes as a close friend.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2378; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 1937). 
“A man will follow the way of his close friend” i.e., he will follow the habits and path of his friends; “So let each of you look” means, think long and hard about; “whom he takes as a close friend” means, whom he regards as a friend and a brother. So if you like a person’s religious commitment and character, take him as a close friend, and if not, then avoid him. For characteristics are easily copied and keeping company with people has an effect on whether you will be good or bad. Al-Ghazaali said: Sitting with and mixing with one whose interest is worldly gain will make you also seek worldly gains; sitting with and mixing with one who is an ascetic will make you care little for worldly gains, because following characteristics are easily copied and one could copy the characteristics of one's friend without even realizing.

Degree of the Hadith about  Salat al-Hajah","Praise be to Allah.Worship Allah the Prophet’s way
It is prescribed for the Muslim to worship Allah in the ways that He has prescribed in His Book, and in the ways that have been proven from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The principle concerning matters of worship is tawqeef [i.e., following what is in the Quran and sahih Sunnah; with no room for individual opinion]. And we cannot say that any act of worship is prescribed unless there is sahih evidence.
What is Salat al-Hajah?
The so-called Salaat al-Hajah was narrated in da’if (weak) or munkar (denounced) ahadith – as far as we know – which cannot be used as proof and which are not fit to base acts of worship on. (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 8/162)
Degree of the Hadith about  Salat al-Hajah
The hadeeth narrated concerning Salat al-Hajah says:
“From ‘Abd-Allah ibn Abi Awfa al-Aslami, who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came out to us and said: ‘Whoever has need of something from Allah or any one of His creation, let him do wudu’ and pray two rak’ahs, then let him say, “There is no god but Allah, the Forbearing, the Most Generous. Glory be to Allah, Lord of the mighty Throne. Praise be to Allah the Lord of the Worlds. O Allah, I ask You for Your mercy and forgiveness and I ask You for all good things and for safety from all sins. I ask You not to leave any sin without forgiving it, or any distress without relieving it, or any need which it pleases You to fulfil without fulfilling it for me.” Then let him ask Allah for whatever matter of this world or the Hereafter that he wishes, for it will be fulfilled.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah, Iqamat al-Salah wa’l-Sunnah, 1374)
Al-Tirmdihi said: “This is a ghareeb [strange] hadeeth, and concerning its isnad it was said: Faid ibn ‘Abd al-Rahman is weak in hadith.
Al-Albani said: rather it is da’if jiddan (very weak). Al-Hakim said: mawdu’ (fabricated) ahadith were narrated from Abu Awfa. (Mishkat al-Masabih, vol. 1, p. 417)

It is better and more perfect and safer for you to  make du'a’ to Allah in the depths of the night and between the adhan and iqamah and at the end of every prayer before the taslim; and on Fridays, for then there are times when dua’ is answered; and when breaking one’s fast.

    of the evil innovators of the Murji’ah who restricted faith to the heart and 
    said that it had nothing to do with outward actions. Moreover, if the heart 
    is sound and filled with faith, that will be manifested in a person’s 
    actions. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “In the body there is a piece of flesh which, if it is sound, the entire 
    body will be sound, and if it is corrupt, the entire body will be corrupt. 
    Indeed it is the heart.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 52; Muslim, 1599). And he 
    also said: “Allaah does not look at the outward appearance or wealth of any 
    one of you; rather he looks at your hearts and deeds.” (Narrated by Muslim, 
    2564)

     Whatever the case, these words of those who stubbornly 
    refuse to follow the truth and carry out the commands of Islam is a sign of 
    their lack of faith by means of which they want to stop those who seek to 
    call them to Islam and advise them.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
10398,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10398,A taxi driver takes some people to haraam places,"My question to you is that i am a student living in australia i also drive cabs part time i want to ask you brother that some times we have to leave passengers to bars,clubs,pubs,and some times to brothels and some times we have to pick them up also when we get a job from there is it haraam to do so? because we do not tell them to go there and we cannot refuse to take them if they ask us to take them there because of the taxi cab laws as you would know people catch cabs in the western world when they are going to drink or come back from home.what should the muslim cab drivers do so in this situation?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Undoubtedly this is considered to be co-operating in sin and transgression. We advise you not to take these people to brothels, places or corruption and bars. You will find other people. This applies whether you are taking them from these places or to them. Whoever fears Allah and keeps his duty towards Him (taqwa), Allah will grant him a way out, so look for other passengers from other places. If it so happens that you take on these passengers and you did not know that this is where they were headed, then we do not say that the fare is haraam for you, because it is compensation for your efforts, or for the use of your car.
Shaykh ‘Abd-Allah ibn Jibreen.
 If you think that you are obliged to so something haraam in your work, then look for other work. We ask Allah to make your provision halaal. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
