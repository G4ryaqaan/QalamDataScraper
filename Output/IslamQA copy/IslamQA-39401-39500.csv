Is nutmeg prohibited?","Praise be to Allah.What is nutmeg?
The nutmeg tree is used as a kind of spice which gives food a fragrant smell and delicious taste. The ancient Egyptians used it as a medicine for stomach disease and to expel wind. 
Its effects are like those of hashish. If it is consumed in large quantities, a person ringing in his ears, severe constipation, difficulty urinating, anxiety, stress, suppression of the central nervous system and possibly death. 
Is nutmeg prohibited?
With regard to the rulings on it, the scholars differed and there are two opinions. 
The majority of scholars are of the view that it is prohibited to use it in small and large quantities. Others are of the view that it is permissible to use a little of it if it is mixed with other substances.  
Ibn Hajar Al-Haytami (d. 974 AH) (may Allah have mercy on him) said concerning nutmeg: 
“When there was a dispute concerning it between the scholars of the Haramayn and Egypt, and there were differences of opinion as to whether it is permissible or prohibited, this question arose: Did any of the imams or their followers state that it is prohibited to eat nutmeg? 
To sum up the answer – as was stated clearly by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Daqeeq Al-Eid – it is an intoxicant. Ibn Al-`Imad went further and regarded hashish as comparable to it. The Malikis, Shafa’is and Hanbalis agreed that it is an intoxicant and comes under the general text: “Every intoxicant is Khamr and all Khamr is prohibited.” The Hanafis are of the view that it is either an intoxicant or a drug, either of which affects the mind, so it is prohibitedin either case.” (See: Az-Zawajir `an Iqtirab Al-Kaba’ir (1/212) and Al-Mukhaddirat by Muhammad `Abd Al-Maqsud (p. 90)
During the eighth conference of medical Fiqh – “The Islamic View on Some Health Problems – prohibited and Impure Substances in Food and Medicine” – which was held in Kuwait between 22-24 Dhul-Hijjah 1415 AH (22-24 May 1995), they said: 
“Narcotic substances are prohibited, and it is not permissible to consume them unless that is for a specific medical purpose, and in the amount specified by doctors, but they are pure in and of themselves. 
There is nothing wrong with using nutmeg to improve the flavour of food, in small amounts that do not cause listlessness or intoxication.”
Shaykh Dr. Wahbah Az-Zuhayli (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“There is no reason why a small amount of nutmeg should not be used to improve the flavour of food, cakes and the like, but a large amount is prohibited, because it is a narcotic.” 
But to be on the safe side we should say that it is not allowed even if it is mixed with other things and there is only a small amount of it, because “that which intoxicates in large amounts, a small amount of it is prohibited.” 
It should be noted that it is prohibited to import nutmeg – both seed and powder – into the Land of the Two Holy Mosques (i.e., Saudi Arabia) and it is permitted only to import it when it is mixed with other spices in permitted proportions, which is no more than 20%.

39431,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39431,The person who is suffering from urinary incontinence does not have to wash himself before the time for prayer ends,"There is a person who is suffering from urinary incontinence. He did wudu after the time for prayer began, then he wanted to repeat his wudu, but the time for the next prayer had not begun. Does he have to wash his private parts (istinja’) when he wants to renew his wudu?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.If the person who is continually breaking his wudu– such as one who is suffering urinary incontinence – renews his wudu before the time for prayer is over, he does not have to wash his private parts when renewing it, because he has wudu according to the ruling.  
But if the time for one prayer ends, then he has to wash his private parts and do wudu again, then pray as much as he wants of obligatory and naafil prayers (during the time for the next prayer), because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to Faatimah bint Abi Hubaysh [who was suffering from prolonged vaginal bleeding], “Wash the blood from yourself then pray, then do wudu for each prayer until that time [i.e., the usual time of menstruation] comes.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 226; Muslim, 333. 
If we assume that he has done wudu, then nothing comes out of him until the time for the next prayer begins, then he does not have to do wudu again, and his first wudu is still valid. 
The words of the fuqaha’ – that he should do wudu at the time of each prayer – apply in cases where something has come out of him. 
Al-Bahooti said in al-Rawd al-Murabba’ (p. 57): “The woman who is suffering from istihaadah [non-menstrual vaginal bleeding], and others like her such as those who are suffering from urinary incontinence, continual emission of madhiy (prostatic fluid) or wind, a wound that bleeds continuously, or a continual nosebleed, should do wudoo when the time for each prayer begins if something has  come out, and they should pray so long as the time for prayer lasts, both obligatory and naafil prayers. If nothing has come out then they do not need to do wudu.

So what should she do? Should she wait until she has finished her studies? May Allaah reward you with good.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The Muslim woman is obliged to wear hijab in front of non-mahram men, because of a great deal of well-known evidence, such as the verses (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks (veils) all over their bodies (i.e. screen themselves completely except the eyes or one eye to see the way). That will be better, that they should be known (as free respectable women) so as not to be annoyed. And Allaah is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful”
[al-Ahzaab 33:59] 
“And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts) and not to show off their adornment except only that which is apparent (like both eyes for necessity to see the way, or outer palms of hands or one eye or dress like veil, gloves, headcover, apron), and to draw their veils all over Juyoobihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms) and not to reveal their adornment except to their husbands, or their fathers, or their husband’s fathers, or their sons, or their husband’s sons, or their brothers or their brother’s sons, or their sister’s sons, or their (Muslim) women (i.e. their sisters in Islam), or the (female) slaves whom their right hands possess, or old male servants who lack vigour, or small children who have no sense of feminine sex. And let them not stamp their feet so as to reveal what they hide of their adornment. And all of you beg Allaah to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful”
[al-Noor 24:31]
It is not permissible to take off hijab because of studying, because that is not a necessity that permits doing something that Allaah has forbidden. So this girl should adhere to her religion and keep her hijab, even if that means giving up her studies. 
It should be noted that whoever puts his trust in Allaah, Allaah will suffice him and protect him, and that whoever fears Allaah, Allaah will make things easy for him, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty).
And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allaah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allaah will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allaah has set a measure for all things”
[al-Talaaq 65:2-3]
She should bear patiently the annoyance and mockery that she may face, remembering the reward that Allaah has prepared for those who adhere to His religion, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There will come a time of patience when the one who adheres (to Islam) will have the reward of fifty martyrs from amongst you.” Narrated by al-Tabaraani from the hadeeth of Ibn Mas’ood; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, no. 2234.

39462,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39462,Some of the Sunnahs of fasting,What are the Sunnahs of fasting?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.There are many Sunnahs of fasting, including the following: 
1 – It is Sunnah if someone insults you to respond in a better manner and say, “I am fasting,” because of the report narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Fasting is a shield or protection so there should be no obscene or offensive talk or behaviour. If a person fights him or insults him, let him say, ‘I am fasting,’ twice. By the One in Whose hand is my soul, the smell coming from the mouth of the fasting person is better before Allah then the fragrance of musk. [Allah says:] ‘He gives up his food, drink and desire for My sake. Fasting is for Me and I will reward for it, and a good deed receives the reward of ten like it.’” Al-Bukhari, no. 1894; Muslim, 1151. 
2 – It is Sunnah for the fasting person to eat suhoor, because it was proven in al-Saheehayn that Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Eat suhoor for in suhoor there is blessing.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1923; Muslim, 1059). 
3 – It is Sunnah to delay suhoor because of the report narrated by al-Bukhari from Anas from Zayd ibn Thaabit (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: “We ate suhoor with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), then he got up to pray.” I said: “How much time was there between the adhaan and suhoor?” He said: “The time it takes to recite fifty verses.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1921). 
4 – It is Sunnah to hasten to break the fast because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The people will continue to be fine so long as they hasten to break the fast.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1957; Muslim, 1098). See also question no. 49716) 
5 – It is Sunnah to break the fast with fresh dates; if none are available then with dry dates; if none are available then with water – because of the hadith of Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to break his fast with fresh dates before praying; if there were no (fresh dates) then with dry dates, and if there were no (dried dates) then he would take a few sips of water.
(Nararted by Abu Dawood, no. 2356; al-Tirmidhi, 696; classed as hasan in al-Irwa’, 4/45) 
6 – It is Sunnah when breaking the fast to say what is narrated in the hadith, which is to say Bismillaah. This is obligatory according to the correct view because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoined that. The words “Allahumma laka sumtu wa ‘ala rizqika aftartu, Allahumma taqabbal minni, innaka antaal-samee’ al-‘aleem (O Allah, for You I have fasted and with Your provision I have broken my fast, O Allah accept (this fast) from me for You are the All-Hearing, All-Knowing) are da’eef (weak), as stated by Ibn al-Qayyim (Zaad al-Ma’aad, 2/51).  There is also another report: “Dhahaba al-‘zama’ wa abtallat al-‘urooq wa thabata al-ajr in sha Allah (the thirst is gone, the veins have been moistened and the reward is assured, if Allah wills).” (Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2357; al-Bayhaqi, 4/239; classed as hasan in al-Irwa’, 4/39). 
There are ahaadeeth which speak of the virtue of the du’aa’ of the fasting person, such as the following: 
(i)                It was narrated from Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Three prayers are not rejected: the prayer of a father, the prayer of a fasting person, and the prayer of a traveler.” Narrated by al-Bayhaqi, 3/345; classed as saheeh by al-Albani in al-Saheeh 1797. 
(ii)              It was narrated from Abu Umaamah in a marfoo’ report: “Every time the fast is broken Allah has people whom He ransoms.” Narrated by Ahmad, 21698; classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Targheeb, 1/491. 
(iii)            It was narrated from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri in a marfoo’ report: “Allah ransoms people every day and night – i.e., in Ramadaan – and every day and night the Muslim has a prayer that is answered.” Narrated by al-Bazzaar; classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Targheeb, 1/491.

He tells me, “I don’t differentiate between those who give me gifts and those who do not.” What is the situation with regard to the money we take from him, the food we eat and the clothes and gold we wear; and what is the situation with regard to our du’aa’ to Allaah. When he gives us food as a gift, should we accept it? Once he forced me to accept clothes from some of these people. Is it permissible for me to wear them?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for your father to accept what is given to him because of his work, because al-Bukhaari (6636) and Muslim (1832) narrated from Abu Humayd al-Saa’idi that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) appointed a man to collect the zakaah, and when he had finished his work, the man came and said, “O Messenger of Allaah, this is for you and this was given to me as a gift.” He said, “Why don’t you sit in the house of your father and mother and see whether you get any gifts or not?” Then the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stood up after ‘Isha’ prayer, testified (to the Oneness of Allaah) and praised Him as He deserves to be praised, then he said, “What is the matter with a zakaah-collector whom we appoint, then he comes and says, ‘This is for you, and this was given to me as a gift.’ Why does he not sit in the house of his father and mother and see whether he receives any gifts or not? By the One in Whose hand is my soul, no one of you steals anything from it [the zakaah] but he will come on the Day of Resurrection carrying it on his shoulders, even if it is a camel that he brings groaning, or a cow that he brings mooing, or a sheep that he brings bleating. I have conveyed the message.” Abu Humayd said: Then the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) raised his hand until I could see the whiteness of his armpit. 
So your father should be told what the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “ ‘Why don’t you sit in the house of your father and mother and see whether you receive any gifts or not?’ – because you are only getting these gifts because of the job to which you have been appointed.” 
If that is the case, then these gifts belong to the job, and he has no right to take them for himself. 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: This hadeeth indicates that it is obligatory for the person who is employed by the state to do the job for which he has been appointed, and he has no right to take any gift that has to do with his work. If he takes it then he should put it in the bayt al-maal (public treasury), and it is not permissible for him to take it for himself because of this saheeh hadeeth, and because that is a means that leads to evil and betraying trust. 
From Fataawa ‘Ulama’ al-Balad al-Haraam, p. 655 
Ahmad and al-Bayhaqi narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Gifts given to workers (employees) are ghulool (lit. stolen war booty)” i.e., a betrayal. This hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, no. 7021. 
Your father’s saying that he does not differentiate between those who give him things and those who do not does not alter the fact that this is haraam, but if he makes things difficult those who do not give him anything, then that makes his sin more serious. 
His claim that he does not differentiate between those who give him gifts and those who do not is dubious, because gifts have an effect on the heart. Man is created in such a way that he likes those who are kind to him, so these gifts may make your father biased towards the one who gave him the gift, so he may give him something he is not entitled to. So let him fear Allaah, and refrain from these haraam earnings, for all the pleasures of this world are temporary, so how about if they are also haraam? 
Whatever he has received of these gifts, it is not permissible for you to take them or make use of them, because this is haraam wealth, 
Whatever you have saved from your father’s salary that he was paid in return for his permissible work, there is nothing wrong with you benefitting from it. 
With regard to the clothes that he forced you to take, if they were bought for the regular price, there is nothing wrong with you wearing them, but if he took them as a gift or for a reduced price, you should not wear them. Try to advise your father, and remind him of the seriousness of haraam wealth, and encourage him to ask the scholars so that they can dispel his doubts.

But if the oil is not solid, the person should make sure that he passes his hand over the part of the body in question, because usually the oil repels water, so the water may not reach all areas of the part of the body being washed.",,"Praise be to Allah.It seems that the small amount of olive oil mentioned would not prevent the water from reaching the hair . 
The basic principle, as mentioned by Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) is that if a person uses cream or oil on the parts of the body washed during Wudu, the oil either remains solid, in which case it must be removed before doing Wudu, because if the oil remains solid, then it prevents the water from reaching the skin, and in that case Wudu is not valid.  
But if the oil is not solid, rather its trace is left on the part of the body washed during Wudu, then it does not matter . But in this case, the person should make sure that he passes his hand over the part of the body in question, because usually the oil repels water, so the water may not reach all areas of the part of the body being washed. (Fatawa At-Taharah, p. 147) 
It may be added that the matter is less crucial with regard to the head because the obligation with regard to the head is to wipe it , not wash it, and wiping means that it is not essential for the water to reach every single hair. 
Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was also asked: 
If a woman applies henna to her hair and it dries, and the like, can she wipe over it? 
He replied: 
“If a woman has applied henna to her hair and it has dried, then she may wipe over it and there is no need for her to undo her hair and wash off this henna, because it was proven that the Prophet had applied something to his hair to keep it together and prevent it from getting dusty whilst in Ihram, and what is applied to the hair is regarded as part of it. This indicates that there is some leeway with regard to purification of the head.” (Fatawa Al-Mar’ah Al-Muslimah, 1/28)

Can you pray tarawih with the wudu of ‘Isha in case of urinary incontinence?","Praise be to Allah.Wudu and prayer in case of urinary incontinence 
Whoever has a problem that constantly breaks his wudu, such as one who suffers from urinary incontinence and constant wind , should do wudu at the time of each prayer, and pray as much as he likes of obligatory and nafl prayers with that wudu, until the time for the next prayer begins. 
That is because of the report narrated in al-Sahihayn from `Aishah who said: Fatimah bint Abi Hubaysh came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: “O Messenger of Allah, I am a woman who suffers from constant non-menstrual bleeding (istihadah), and I never become pure. Should I give up prayer?” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “No, rather that is from a vein, and it is not menstruation. When your regular time of menstruation comes, then stop praying, and when that time is over, wash the blood off yourself and pray, then do wudu for every prayer until that time comes.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 226 – this version was narrated by him; and Muslim, 333.) 
The scholars regarded the one who suffers urinary incontinence as coming under the same rulings as the woman who suffers from istihadah (irregular non-menstrual bleeding). 
But if he knows that the urine will stop within the time when he will be able to purify himself and pray, then he has to delay the prayer until that time. 
Scenarios of urinary incontinence
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said: 
When a person suffers from urinary incontinence, one of two scenarios must apply: 
1.      If it is constant and does not stop, and every time any amount collects in the bladder it comes out, then when the time for prayer comes, he should cover his private part with something and pray, and it will not matter if something comes out. 
2.      If it will stop after he urinates, or ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after that, then he should wait until it stops, then do wudu and pray, even if he misses prayer in congregation.  (Asilah al-Bab al-Maftuh, Q. 17, no. 67) 
Purification in case of istihadah
The scholars differed with regard to the taharah (purification) of the woman who suffers from istihadah and others like her – is the taharah invalidated when the time for prayer ends or when the time for the next prayer begins? For example, one who does wudu for Fajr prayer – can she pray Duha prayer or ‘Eid prayer with this wudu or not? 
Those who say that her wudu is invalidated when the time for (Fajr) prayer ends say that she is not allowed to do that, because when the sun rises, her wudu comes to an end. 
Those who say that her wudu is invalidated when the time for the next prayer begins, say that it is permissible for her to pray Duha or ‘Eid prayer with the wudu for Fajr, because her wudu lasts until the time for Zuhr begins. 
Both views are narrated in the madhhab of Imam Ahmad and others (al-Insaf, 1/378; al-Mawsu’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 3/212) 
To be on the safe side, she should do wudu again for Duha and ‘Eid prayer; this was stated in a fatwa by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him). Please see question no. 22843 . 
When to make wudu for each prayer
Based on the above, you cannot do wudu before the time for prayer, whether that is so that you can pray in congregation or for some other reason, because your wudu will be invalidated when the time for the next prayer begins. 
But we would like to point out that this ruling applies only when the impurity is ongoing. But if we assume that the person who has incontinence does wudu, then nothing comes out of him until the time for the next prayer begins, he does not have to do wudu, and his first wudu is still valid. 
The words of the jurists – let him do wudu for each prayer – apply if something comes out of him. 
Al-Bahuti said in al-Rawd al-Murabba’ (p. 57): 
“For the woman who is suffering istihadah and those who suffer incontinence or continual emission of madhiy (prostatic fluid) or wind… should do wudu when the time for each prayer begins, if something comes out, and should offer obligatory and nawafil prayers so long as that time lasts. If nothing comes out then they do not have to do wudu.” 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The woman who is suffering from istihadah has to do wudu at the time for each prayer, if something comes out; if nothing comes out of her then her first wudu remains valid.” (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 1/438) 
How to clean clothes in case of urinary incontinence 
If you are outside the home and your wudu is invalidated because the time for the next prayer begins, and you want to pray, then you have to repeat your wudu, after washing the private part and covering it with something that will prevent the emission coming out as much as possible. 
Underwear is purified by washing it. If you single out a clean garment for prayer which you can carry with you, that will be easier for you. If it is too difficult to wash your clothes or change them, then pray as you are. 
Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“The sick person who is suffering with urinary incontinence and cannot be cured with treatment has to do wudu for each prayer after the time for prayer begins. He should wash off whatever has gotten onto his body and set aside clean clothes for prayer, if that is not too difficult for him. If he cannot do that then he is excused, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and has not laid upon you in religion any hardship” [al-Hajj 22:78] 
“Allah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you” [al-Baqarah 2:185]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If I command you to do a thing, then do as much of it as you can.” He should take precautions to prevent urine spreading on his body or clothes or the place where he prays.” (Fatawa Islamiyyah, 1/192) 
If it is too hard for you to do wudu and wash your clothes for every prayer, then it is permissible for you to join Zuhr and `Asr and pray them with one wudu at the time of either of them, and to join Maghrib and ‘Isha likewise, whether that is in your house or elsewhere. 
Can you join prayers in case of urinary incontinence 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 24/14: 
“Those who are sick or suffering from istihadah may join their prayers .” 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 4/559: 
“It is permissible for the woman who is suffering from istihadah to join Zuhr and `Asr, and Maghrib and `Isha, because it is difficult for her to do wudu for every prayer.” 
Can you pray tarawih with the wudu of ‘Isha in case of urinary incontinence? 
You can pray Tarawih with the wudu you did for `Isha, even if the Tarawih prayers last until after midnight. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: 
Is it permissible for a woman who is suffering from istihadah to pray qiyam al-layl if it will end at midnight, with the wudu of `Isha’? 
He replied: 
“This is an area concerning which there is a difference of scholarly opinion. Some of the scholars said that when midnight comes she has to repeat her wudu, and some said that she does not have to repeat her wudu – this is the more correct opinion.” (Fatawa al-Taharah, p. 286)

For two years I have been tasting the bitterness of patience whilst they are living with love and ecstasy as he says and as I see him. Will it ever end and will I suffer this torment forever? I pray to Allaah the Almighty for forgiveness and I pray to Him night and day but I see that nothing happens to her, she is like a mountain that will never collapse. I am caught between my husband’s mistreatment and his love for another right before my eyes. I feel that I am no longer a human being and I think that I have lost all trust in anything. What should I do? Pray to Allaah to save me from this and to make my faith steadfast and to protect me from their evil and their arrogance…. Ameen.",,,"Praise be to Allah.We ask Allaah to grant you relief from your distress and to increase your faith 
    and steadfastness. 
What you have mentioned about your husband’s actions is something reprehensible 
    with which Allaah and His Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) are not pleased, and of which His righteous slaves do not 
    approve. 
Romantic relationships between men and women are not allowed, and it is clearly 
    haraam, whether that is via the internet or over the phone, or otherwise. If it goes beyond that to meetings and immoral actions, then this is the 
    essence of doom. 
Were it not for this ecstasy that your husband is experiencing, he would feel 
    pain, alienation and confusion, which is what is usually felt by the sinner who persists in his sin. 
Do not believe that he is living a life of pleasure and enjoyment, rather it is 
    intoxication, negligence and a drifting away from Allaah, as Allaah says concerning those who commit immoral actions (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 
“Verily, by your life (O Muhammad), in their wild intoxication, they were 
    wandering blindly”
[al-Hijr 15:72]
One of the most abhorrent of actions is when a person commits his sin openly and 
    boasts about it, not caring about the punishment that awaits him. Hence the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “All of 
    my ummah may be forgiven except those who commit sin openly, and part of committing sin openly is when a man does something at night, then in the 
    morning, when Allaah has concealed him, he says, ‘O So and so, I did such and such last night,’ when his Lord had concealed him all night but he 
    discloses that which Allaah had concealed.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6069. 
You should praise Allaah for protecting you and sapring you, and making you better 
    than women of that ilk. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever sees a person who is afflicted with some trial 
    and says, ‘Al-hamdu Lillaah alladhi ‘aafani mimma abtalaaka bihi wa faddalani ‘ala katheer mimman khalaqa tafdeelan (Praise be to Allaah 
    who has spared me that with which He has tested you and has favoured me over many of those whom He has created),’ that trial will not befall him.” 
    Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (3432) and Ibn Maajah (3892); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
You should note that Allaah gives the evildoer respite until, when He seizes him, 
    He does not let him go, as the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah gives respite to the wrongdoer until, when 
    He seizes him, He does not let him go.” Then he recited (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Such is the Seizure of your Lord when He seizes the (population of) towns 
    while they are doing wrong. Verily, His Seizure is painful (and) severe”
[Hood 11:102]
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4409; Muslim, 2583. 
So you should not be deceived by the fact that this woman continues to do wrong 
    and seems to get away scot-free, for there is no barrier between the prayer of the oppressed and Allaah. 
Perhaps you can find some good people who will advise him and remind him of 
    Allaah, even if that is via a Friday khutbah, for example, condemning such haraam relationships and describing the punishments in this world and 
    the Hereafter for those who do such things. 
Make a lot of du’aa’ to Allaah, especially at times when prayers are answered, 
    such as the last third of the night, between the adhaan and iqaamah, between ‘Asr and Maghrib on Friday. There is nothing wrong with your making 
    du’aa’ against her because she is an evildoer, but it is better to pray that Allaah will improve your situation. 
You have to be kind to your husband and make yourself beautiful for him, for 
    perhaps that woman has captured his heart with kind words that he did not hear from you, or by making herself beautiful when you did not. So try 
    to win him over in that way. And you have to be patient, for this is a test from Allaah by means of which your sins will be expiated and you will 
    be raised in status. 
And Allaah knows best.",Islam Q&A
