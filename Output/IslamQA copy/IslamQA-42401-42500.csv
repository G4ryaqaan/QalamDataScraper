There is nothing wrong with saying, “Fulaan al-marhoom (So and so upon whom Allaah has 
    mercy?),” and “May Allaah shower him with His Mercy,” because saying “marhoom (the one on whom Allaah has mercy)” comes under the heading of 
    optimism and hope, not of giving news. If it comes under the heading of optimism and hope, there is nothing wrong with it. 
With regard to saying “He has gone to the mercy of Allaah,” this also appears to come under the 
    heading of optimism, not of giving news, because this is one of the matters of the unseen, and we cannot be certain of it. 
But we should not say, “He has gone to join the higher ranks.”","From Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him), 3/85"

What must we do now? Should we cut our hair now? Is my marriage contract invalidated for this reason, because I did it this year?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.You have to cut your hair now, but you do not have to do anything else. The scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas were asked about a woman who did Hajj and did all the actions of Hajj, except that she did not cur her hair until now, out of ignorance or forgetfulness. She has reached her homeland and she is asking what she has to do. 
They replied: If the matter is as the questioner has described, that she did everything except cutting her hair, either out of forgetfulness or ignorance, then she has to cut her hair in her homeland, and she does not have to do anything else due to her delaying it because of ignorance or forgetfulness, with the intention of completing her Hajj.

As for the marriage contract, it is valid, because if the pilgrim does all the rituals but omits to shave his head, then it becomes permissible for him to do all the things that are forbidden whilst in ihraam (which includes getting married), except intercourse.

42458,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/42458,Ruling on bringing in satellite channels,"I had an argument with my wife about bringing a satellite dish into the house, because she wants to watch these channels but I am worried that they will contain haraam things. What is your opinion?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The one who hears and reads and sees what is presented in 
    these channels, will have no hesitation in regarding it as haraam to bring 
    this equipment into the home, because of the great damage that it does to 
    religious commitment and morals, especially when there are children in the 
    house and there is a lack of spiritual awareness and religious commitment. 

    That can be avoided by bringing in Islamic channels such as 
    al-Majd. As for indecent channels, the situation is obviously clear. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) warned 
    against bringing this equipment into the home in one of his khutbahs, where 
    he said: 

    We spoke about the [satellite] dish two weeks ago and we 
    explained the danger that it poses to a person during his life and after his 
    death. Many people were surprised that the warning was so stern. But we will 
    pose some questions, by answering which we will reach a conclusion. We 
    should ask about the words of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him): “There is no person whom Allaah appoints in charge of 
    people’s affairs and he dies neglecting them, but Allaah will forbid 
    Paradise to him.” Is this hadeeth saheeh? Yes, it is saheeh and is proven in
    Saheeh al-Bukhaari, Saheeh Muslim and elsewhere. 

    Secondly: 

    Is a man the shepherd of his family or not? The answer is 
    yes, he is the shepherd of his family. The Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) appointed him as such when he said: “The man is the 
    shepherd of his family and is responsible for his flock.” This may also be 
    understood from the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “O you who believe! Ward off yourselves and your families 
    against a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones”

    [al-Tahreem 66:6]. 

    The second question is: If a man installs a dish for his 
    family and sees the great evils and things that go against sound morals, is 
    he neglecting them or being sincere towards them? 

    I believe that we would all respond by saying that he is 
    undoubtedly neglecting them, because this is going against the words of 
    Allaah, “ you who believe! Ward off yourselves and your families against 
    a Fire…”, and because watching the things that we hear of is a cause of 
    moral decline. And if morals decline, religious commitment and belief 
    (‘aqeedah) will decline too. Nations rise and fall according to their degree 
    of morality, and as this is the case, if he dies with this dish in his 
    house, he will be counted as neglecting the flock in charge of whom Allah 
    appointed him by the words of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him). So there is no way out other than removing 
    this dish from the home altogether. In our previous khutbah we explained 
    that it is not permissible to sell it, because if it is sold it will be used 
    for disobedience towards Allaah, so that will come under the heading of 
    helping others to disobey Allaah. In that case there is no better way to 
    discharge one's duty than breaking it, and Allaah will compensate him for 
    that. Do you not see that the Prophet of Allaah Sulaymaan (peace be upon 
    him) had “ displayed before him, in the afternoon, well trained horses of 
    the highest breed” [Saad 38:36], and they distracted him from 
    remembering Allaah until the sun had set. Then he called for them and began 
    to strike their necks and feet, because they had distracted him from the 
    remembrance of Allaah. So he killed them lest they distract him again, The 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was given a fine, 
    printed garment (khameesah) and he put it on, but whilst he was praying he 
    looked at it once, and when he said the salaam he  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) said: “Take this khameesah of mine and give it to Abu 
    Jahm, and bring me his plain garment.” Abu Jahm was the one who had given it 
    to him, and he did not want to hurt his feelings, so he  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, explaining why he was doing that: “It 
    distracted me from my prayer just now.” This indicates that if a man sees 
    something in his possessions that will distract him from remembrance of 
    Allaah or cause him to disobey Allaah, he should get rid of it altogether.  

    I repeat once again: some people understood from what I said 
    before that if a person dies with a dish in his house, that he will be one 
    of the people of Hell, but this is a misunderstanding, because the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) only said: “Allaah will 
    deprive him of Paradise”. This is a warning which is to be understood in the 
    light of what it says in the Qur’aan and Sunnah, that if a man commits a sin 
    but he has faith in his heart, then he will not abide in Hell forever, 
    because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  

    “Verily, Allaah forgives not that partners should be set 
    up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to 
    whom He wills”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:48]

    But I was pleased that one of the people who heard my 
    previous khutbah – may Allaah bless him and reward him with good – went and 
    broke the dish that he had and destroyed it completely. He will find the joy 
    of that in his heart, because this is a sign of complete faith. When a woman 
    came to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) wearing 
    two heavy bracelets of gold on her arm, he said: “Do you pay zakaah on 
    these?” She said: No. He said: “Would you like Allaah to give you two 
    bracelets of fire instead of them?” She took them off and gave them to the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: They are 
    for Allaah and His Messenger. When the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) saw a man with a gold ring on his finger, he said: 
    “Would one of you go to a burning ember and put it in his hand – or on his 
    finger?” Then the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    took the ring and threw it aside. Then it was said to the man, after the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had gone away: Take 
    your ring and benefit from it (by selling it). He said: By Allaah, I will 
    not pick up a ring that the Prophet SAW threw away. Think about how the 
    Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) were and how they hastened to 
    give up that which was forbidden by Allaah and His Messenger. Hence they 
    were the most perfect of this ummah in faith, and they were the best of 
    generations, as it was narrated that the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) said: “The best of people are my generation, then 
    those who come after them, then those who come after them. I say it once 
    again: I fear for the one who brings this equipment that destroys morals and 
    leads people astray. If he is truly wise he will break it so that his home 
    will be free of these haraam things, and so that he will die being sincere 
    towards his family, in sha Allaah. So fear Allaah and fulfil the trust. O 
    Allaah, help us to fulfil the trust and to do that which You love and are 
    pleased with, O Lord of the Worlds. O Allaah,  guide us and guide (our 
    families) for us, and guide by means of us, O Lord of the Worlds. End quote 
    from the shaykh’s website:

    These words are sufficient, in sha Allaah, to explain the 
    ruling on this dish and its dangers.

She has done many things in her life that she has bitterly regretted and sincerely repented for, and she is always wishing she could go back in time and correct the past.

Recite, if you wish: ‘No person knows what is kept hidden for them of joy’"".

    Firstly: 

    You should note, may Allaah bless you, that people’s life 
    spans are in the hand of Allaah, Who says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“For everything there is 
    a time prescribed”
[al-Ra’d 13:38 - 
    Pickthall] 

    “and no person knows in what land he will die”

    [Luqmaan 31:34]

    It is not possible for anyone to know when he will die; it is 
    only speculation which may be proven true or may be proven false. 

    Sickness – for example – does not mean that a person will die 
    soon, just as being young and strong does not mean that a person will live 
    for a long time. 

    How often have people assumed that a sick person will die 
    soon, then he has lived for a long time. And how often has death come 
    suddenly to a healthy person. 

    The poet spoke the truth when he said:

     Equip yourself with piety, for you do not know, when night 
    comes, whether you will live till dawn.

    How many young men laugh in the evening and the morning, when 
    their shrouds have been prepared but they do not realize?

    How often do people hope for a long life for young people, 
    then their bodies enter the darkness of the grave.

    How many brides have been adorned for their grooms, when it 
    has been decreed on Laylat al-Qadar that their souls are to be taken.

    How many healthy people have died for no reason, and how many 
    sick people lived for a long time. 

    What is required of the believer is to prepare for death at 
    any time, by repenting to Allaah and doing righteous deeds. Ibn Maajah 
    (4259) narrated that Ibn ‘Umar said: I was with the Messenger of Allaah  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when a man from among the Ansaar 
    came to him and greeted the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) with salaam, then he said: “O Messenger of Allaah, which of the 
    believers is best?” He said: “The one who is best in attitude.” He said: 
    “Which of the believers is most wise?” He said: “The one who remembers death 
    the most, and is best prepared for what comes after it. Those are the wise.” 
    Al-Iraaqi said: its isnaad is jayyid. It was classed as hasan by al-Albaani 
    in Saheeh Ibn Maajah. 
Who 
    has guided your sister to repent and to regret what she has done in the 
    past. 
    
    We send her the glad tidings that if she is sincere in her 
    repentance, then Allaah will accept her repentance and will turn her bad 
    deeds into good deeds. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Except those who repent and believe (in Islamic 
    Monotheism), and do righteous deeds; for those, Allaah will change their 
    sins into good deeds, and Allaah is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful”

    [al-Furqaan 25:70]

    See also question no.

    Secondly: 

    When the believer enters Paradise, Allaah will give him all 
    that he wishes for, and more than he wishes for. Allaah says (interpretation 
    of the meaning): 

    “Trays of gold and cups will be passed round them; (there 
    will be) therein all that inner‑selves could desire, and all that eyes could 
    delight in and you will abide therein forever”

    [al-Zukhruf 43:71]

    Al-Bukhaari (806) narrated from Abu Hurayrah and Abu Sa’eed 
    al-Khudri (may Allaah be pleased with them) in a lengthy hadeeth that the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told them of the 
    last of the people of Paradise to be admitted to Paradise. Allaah will say 
    to him:  

    “Tell Me your wishes.” So he will say all that he wishes for, 
    and Allaah will prompt him to mention other wishes and when he cannot wish 
    for any more, Allah will say “You will have that and a similar amount 
    besides.” Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allaah be pleased with him) said to Abu 
    Hurayrah, The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said, “Allaah said, ‘You will have that and ten times more.’” Abu 
    Hurayrah said, “I only remember the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) saying, ‘You will have that and a similar 
    amount besides.’” Abu Sa’eed said, “I heard him saying, ‘You will have that 
    and ten times more.’” 

    But if a believer wishes to go back to this world then he 
    will not be granted that, because Allaah has decreed that no one will go 
    back to this world. 

    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And a ban is laid on every town (population) which We 
    have destroyed that they shall not return (to this world again, nor repent 
    to Us)”

    [al-Anbiya’ 21:95]
i.e., the people of the 
    towns that Allaah has destroyed will wish to go back to this world so that 
    they can make up for what they missed. 

    See Tafseer al-Sa’di, 868. 

    Al-Bukhaari (2817) and Muslim (1877) narrated that Anas ibn 
    Maalik said: The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said: “No one who enters Paradise will wish to come back to this world, even 
    if he were to be given all that it contains, except for the martyr, who will 
    wish that he could come back and killed ten times because of the honour that 
    he sees.” 

    But that wish will not be granted to him. 

    Al-Tirmidhi (3010) and Ibn Maajah (190) narrated that Jaabir 
    ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Haraam said: “The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) met me on the day of Uhud and said: ‘O 
    Jaabir, shall I not tell you what Allaah said to your father?’ I said: ‘Yes, 
    O Messenger of Allaah.’ He said: ‘Allaah has never spoken to anyone except 
    from behind a screen, but He spoke to your father directly and said: “O My 
    slave, ask something from Me and I shall give it to you.” He said, “O Lord, 
    bring me back to life so that I may be killed for Your sake a second time.” 
    The Lord, may He be glorified, said: “I have already decreed that they will 
    not return to life.” He said, “My Lord, then convey (this news) to those 
    whom I have left behind.” Allaah said:

    “Think not of those as dead who are killed in the way of 
    Allaah. Nay, they are alive, with their Lord, and they have provision”

    [Aal ‘Imraan 3:169].’” 
Classed as saheeh by 
    al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah. 

    We ask Allaah to bless your sister and all the Muslims with 
    sincere repentance.

42475,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/42475,He was given some charity that was came from riba-based wealth; can he go for hajj with it?,"I have not performed the obligatory Hajj, and someone gave me some money with which to go for Hajj, but it is known that he deals with riba. Is it permissible for me to use this money to go for Hajj?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    If a person is given some charity by someone who deals in 
    riba, there is nothing wrong with him using that money to go for Hajj, and 
    there is no sin on him if he accepts what is given to him, because the sin 
    of riba is borne by the one who engages in it. As for the one who takes it 
    in a manner that is approved of in sharee’ah, such as by being given it as a 
    gift or a charity, there is no sin on him.  

    The evidence for that is the fact that the Messenger  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) accepted gifts from the Jews, 
    and he ate the food of the Jews, and bought from the Jews, even though the 
    Jews are known for dealing in riba and consuming haraam wealth. 

    Yes, if we assume that someone steals a sheep from a man’s 
    flock and comes and gives it to him, then in that case it is haraam, because 
    you know that this sheep does not belong to him. But if he was dealing in 
    riba, then his sin is on himself, and whoever takes it from him in a manner 
    that is approved of in sharee’ah, it is permissible for him. So we say to 
    this woman: there is no sin on you if you go for Hajj with the money that 
    has been given to you by one who is known to deal in riba. End quote.","Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him)  - Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 21/105"
