42804,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/42804,Fasting is not sufficient when one is able to feed poor persons for kafaarat al-yameen,"I had to offer kafaarat al-yameen (expiation for breaking an oath), so I fasted for three days even though I was able to feed ten poor persons. Is what I did correct?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not sufficient to fast when one is able to feed or clothe poor persons or free a slave, because Allaah stated that one should fast only if one is unable to feed or clothe poor persons or free a slave. He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allaah will not punish you for what is unintentional in your oaths, but He will punish you for your deliberate oaths; for its expiation (a deliberate oath) feed ten Masaakeen (poor persons), on a scale of the average of that with which you feed your own families, or clothe them or manumit a slave. But whosoever cannot afford (that), then he should fast for three days. That is the expiation for the oaths when you have sworn”

42822,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/42822,Owner of a medical laboratory giving doctors some money so that they will send their patients to him,"Is it permissible for the owner of a medical laboratory to make an agreement with some doctors so that they will send their patients to him in return for a payment for these tests? 

Please note that this will not be paid for by the patients and that the charges for these tests will be the same as the charges in other labs.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
      It is not permissible for the owner of the lab to give the 
      doctor who sends a patient to him for testing a share of the money, 
      because that is regarded as a kind of bribe, which is haraam. 

    And Allaah is the Source of strength. May Allaah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.","From Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 23/566"
42863,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/42863,It is not permissible to elect to city councils etc those who mock the Islamic religion,Is it permissible for a Muslim to elect to city councils or any other kind of council someone who believes in communism or mocks religion or embraces nationalism and regards it as a religion?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible 
      for a Muslim to elect to city councils or any other kind of council 
      someone who is known to be a communist or to mock the Islamic religion or 
      to believe in nationalism and regard it as a religion, because by electing 
      him he is accepting him as his representative and helping him to be in a 
      position where he could spread evil or cause corruption, and help those 
      who agree with him and his beliefs. That position may enable him to harm 
      those who differ from him and deprive them of their rights or some of 
      them. It is also a way of encouraging him to persist in his false beliefs 
      and implement them as much as he wants.","From Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah li’l-Ifta, 23/404"
42869,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/42869,Supervisor of a waqf asking daa’iyahs to give a monthly report does not detract from their sincerity,"There is an organization that employs a number of daa’iyahs to work in da’wah, and asks them to submit a report at the end of each month describing their da’wah activities such as lessons, conferences and lectures, to be given to the supervisor of the waqf. Some of the daa’iyahs are reluctant to submit reports and think that it detracts from sincerity towards Allaah and is more akin to showing off. 

My question: is this permissible? I mean, asking for a report on da’wah activities – does it detract from sincerity or not?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
      For the organization that is in charge of da’wah activities 
      to ask for monthly reports on the activities undertaken during the month 
      to submit to the waqf supervisor does not detract from sincerity towards 
      Allaah, and does not come under the heading of showing off if the 
      intention of the daa’iyah is preparing the report is to demonstrate that 
      he has done what is required of him and to allow the supervisor of the 
      waqf to see what he has been doing and ensure that the money paid to the 
      daa’iyahs is being spent appropriately. 
In fact, this is 
    something which is required in employment, because it encourages 
    productivity and allows for recognition of achievement, and creates a motive 
    for striving harder. And Allaah is the Source of strength. May Allaah send 
    blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and 
    companions.","From Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah li’l-Ifta’, 23/409"
42894,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/42894,Pharmaceutical company offering bribes to doctors for fear that their products may not sell,"I am a pharmacist working in one of the pharmaceutical companies as an advertising rep selling some of this company’s drugs. We give gifts to the doctors in the hospitals and private and public clinics, such as pens and watches on which is written the name of the product or the name of the distributing company. This is so that the doctor will prescribe this medicine or the medicines that we distribute to the patients. Most of the competing companies do that and do it to a great extent, such that we find ourselves forced to do it, otherwise our products will not sell. Hence patients fall victim to competition. What is the ruling on doing such things?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible 
      to do such things, and it is regarded as a bribe which is haraam, because 
      it makes the employee limit himself to the company that has given him a 
      gift and ignore the other companies. This is consuming people’s wealth 
      unlawfully and harming others. What you must do is to avoid this and warn 
      others against it, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
      be upon him) cursed the one who gives a bribe and the one who takes it. We 
      ask Allaah to keep us safe and sound. 

    From Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 23/576 

    There is another wrongful action which the questioner refers 
    to, which is: 

    This action may also harm the patient, as the doctor may 
    prescribe this medicine to him, in the hope of getting a gift from the 
    company that produces it, even though some other medicine may be more 
    beneficial to the patient. 

    And Allaah knows best.",Islam Q&A
