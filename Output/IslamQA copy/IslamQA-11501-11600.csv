11502,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11502,Ruling on buying and keeping stuffed animals,It is permissible to buy and sell and to keep stuffed animals?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
      Firstly: 
Allaah and His Messenger 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade wasting money. 
    Al-Bukhaari (5975) and Muslim (593) narrated from al-Mugheerah ibn Shu’bah 
    that he said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) say: ‘Allaah has forbidden three things: gossip, asking 
    too many questions, and wasting money.’” 

    Each person will be asked, on the Day of Resurrection, about 
    his wealth: where he acquired it from and on what he spent it. Narrated by 
    al-Tirmidhi, 2417; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 

    Secondly: 

    The Muslim whom Allaah has blessed with surplus wealth should 
    thank his Lord for this wealth, and send it forth for his Hereafter by 
    spending it on charitable purposes. 

    One of the greatest means of doing so is by helping his 
    Muslim brothers and meeting their needs. This is what is required by the 
    brotherhood of faith. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “The believers are nothing else than brothers (in Islamic 
    religion)”

    [al-Hujuraat 49:10]

    And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said: “The Muslim is the brother of his fellow Muslim.” Narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari and Muslim. 

    It is no secret that many Muslims are suffering from hunger 
    and sickness in many parts of the world. 

    Thirdly: 

    Shaykh Ibn Baaz was asked about the ruling on keeping stuffed 
    birds and animals, and what is the ruling on selling them? Is there any 
    difference between animals which it is haraam to keep when alive and animals 
    which it is permitted to keep when alive, if they are stuffed? 

    He replied: 
Keeping stuffed birds and 
    animals, regardless of whether it is haraam or permissible to keep them when 
    alive, is a waste of money and a kind of extravagance, because these things 
    cost money. Allaah has forbidden extravagance and wastefulness, and the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade wasting 
    money. This is also a means of making images of birds etc that have souls, 
    and displaying them in houses, offices, etc, which is haraam. So it is not 
    permissible to sell them or keep them.

11505,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11505,He wants to open accounts to save money for each of his children,"I have some funds with me. I have four children and I want to save some money for each one of them and have tentatively  planned the saved funds to be used towards their education /marriage. My idea  is to open one bank account for each one of them and place equal or different amount in each account. From my side I intend to consider these amounts as their money (that is in their milkiyyah). Suppose I need some  money later at any stage for day-to-day living of my family, I want to use it for this purpose. This is because of a hearsay (as I have no hadith to offer) that funds of children are funds of father. By the way, except one, my children have not  attained adult age. I know I will have to pay Zakat on these amounts. 

My questions are:- 

How to achieve what I have planned religiously? Is it allowed this way? 

Can I use the money as explained above.",,,"Praise be to Allah.You 
          can open bank accounts for each of your children, but on the condition 
          that you treat them fairly, and do not prefer any of the males over 
          the others, or any of the  females over the others. So each male 
          should have the share of two females. This is an important matter which 
          must be paid attention to. If you need any of this money, then you may 
          take whatever you want, but you must make sure that you are fair so 
          that the amounts left are fair, and that the males have twice the share 
          of the females, and you do not show preference to one child over another.  
          
        You 
          must also pay attention to zakaah each time a year passes. Try to find 
          a bank that does not deal in ribaa (if there is one) so that you will

      person was infertile, and the doctors told him, you do not have any sperm.
      He went abroad and made an agreement to take sperm from someone else and

      she does not know the truth. Then he repented to Allaah and he is asking

      Of course these are not his children.
       
      
      Question: He knows
      that the sperm did not come from him.
Answer: They are not
      his children. Some scholars say that if a zaani claims his child as his
      own, the child may be named after him, but this is not his child. He is
      not like a zaani, because in the case of a zaani the sperm comes from him,
      but this sperm did not come from this man. He has to disown these children
      and give them to the government or do something with them (by putting them
      in a place where they will be taken care of or giving them to a charitable
      organization which will sponsor their upbringing).
 Question: Shall
      we tell him, you should not call them after yourself (give them your
      name)?
Answer: Yes, (tell
      him) to disown them, and give them to the government, or let them stay
      with their mother, on the condition that they are not named after this
      man.
      
      
      Question: Does the hadeeth “the child is for the bed” apply in this
      case?
      
      
      Answer: No, it does not apply.

      We ask Allaah to keep us safe and sound. This is one of
      the (crimes) which modern civilization has committed against people’s
      lineages and honour, and one of the ways in which it has deceived people.
      Social disasters of this sort are the expected result of the sins of
      lying, forgery and deceit which this man has committed against his wife.
      How could he have done this thing, which is forbidden by sharee’ah, and
      which goes against the shar’i aims of protecting lineages and against
      his own manhood? This is a particularly ugly way of cooperating in sin and
      transgression and taking part in falsehood, on the part of the donor or
      vendor of the sperm, and the criminal doctor who agreed to do the
      operation. It is to Allaah that we complain when religion becomes a
      stranger in people’s lives and the immoral enemies of Islam prevail. And

11515,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11515,Prohibition on quid-pro-quo marriage and its evil consequences,Two men agreed that each of them would give his sister in marriage to the other. What is the ruling on this marriage?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.This marriage is known in Arabic as nikaah al-shighaar (quid-pro-quo marriage). It is haraam and was forbidden by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
Nikaah al-shighaar refers to when a man gives his daughter, sister or other female relative whose guardian he is in marriage on the basis that the other man will give him a female relative in marriage, or will let his son or nephew marry his daughter, sister or niece, and so on. The marriage contract done on this basis is invalid, whether a mahr is stated or not, because the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade that and warned against it. And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And whatsoever the Messenger (Muhammad) gives you, take it; and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it)” [al-Hashr 59:7]
In al-Saheehayn it is narrated from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade shighaar. 
In Saheeh Muslim (1416) it is narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade shighaar. Ibn Numayr added: Shighaar means when a man says to another: “Give me your daughter in marriage and I will give you my daughter in marriage, or give me your sister in marriage and I will give you my sister in marriage.” 
And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no shighaar in Islam.” Narrated by Muslim, 1415. 
These saheeh ahaadeeth indicate that nikaah al-shighaar is haraam and invalid, and that it goes against the laws of Allah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not differentiate between that in which a mahr is mentioned and that in which no mahr is mentioned. 
With regard to what was narrated in the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Umar, explaining shighaar as being when one man gives his daughter in marriage to another on the basis that he (the latter) will give him (the former) his daughter in marriage with no dowry (mahr) between them – the scholars have stated that these are the words of Naafi’, the narrator who transmitted it from Ibn ‘Umar, and are not the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained it as narrated in the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah quoted above, as being when a man gives his daughter or sister in marriage on the basis that the other man will give him his daughter or sister in marriage. He did not say, “with no dowry between them.” This indicates that whether there a dowry is mentioned or not has no effect on that. Rather the factor that determines that this marriage contract is invalid is the idea of exchange or reciprocity. That leads to a great deal of corruption, because it may lead to women being forced to marry people they have no desire to marry, and giving precedence to the interests of guardians over the interests of women. This is an evil thing and injustice towards women. It also deprives women of the dowries that their peers receive, as happens among those who engage in this wrongful contract, except those whom Allah wills. It also leads to a great deal of arguments and disputes after marriage; this is an example of the immediate punishment (in this world) for those who go against sharee’ah. 
Ahmad (16414) and Abu Dawood (2075) narrated with a saheeh isnaad from ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Hormuz that al-‘Abbaas ibn ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Abbaas gave his daughter in marriage to ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn al-Hakam, and ‘Abd al-Rahmaan gave his daughter to him in marriage, and each of them gave a dowry. Mu’aawiyah ibn Abi Sufyaan, who was the caliph, wrote to Marwaan ordering him to separate them, and he said in his letter: “This is the shighaar which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade.” 
This incident which took place at the time of the caliph Mu’aawiyah clearly shows us what was meant by the shighaar that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade in the hadeeths quoted above, and demonstrates that mentioning a dowry does not make the marriage valid or alter the fact that it is shighaar, because al-‘Abbaas ibn ‘Abd-Allah and ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn al-Hakam both mentioned a dowry, but Mu’aawiyah (may Allah be pleased with him) did not pay any attention to that, and he ordered that they be separated and said: “This is the shighaar which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade.” Mu’aawiyah (may Allah be pleased with him) had a better knowledge of the Arabic language and the meanings of the hadeeths of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) than Naafi’, the freed slave of Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them all). 
With regard to the solution for one who has become involved in a shighaar marriage and who loves his wife and his wife loves him, the answer is for them to do a new marriage contract with a wali (guardian) and a new mahr, and with two witnesses of good character. In this manner they will have done what is required of them and the wife will become permissible (for the husband). They must also repent to Allah for what happened before, and if they have children, they are to be attributed to the father because they thought that the marriage was valid. But if the husband does not love the wife or vice versa, then he has to divorce her with one talaaq, which will be a revocable divorce, and she will have the right to marry someone else once her ‘iddah is over. If the husband wants to take her back, then he may do so with a new marriage contract, if she wants to go back, in which case there are two divorces left, and there is nothing wrong with him marrying her anew during the ‘iddah period.",From Hukm Nikaah al-Shighaar by Shaykh ;Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz

11527,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11527,Moving the forefinger during the Tashahhud,"What is the detailed explanation for moving the forefinger during the Tashahhud, and is there a hadeeth about that?
 
May Allah reward you with good and benefit the ummah by your knowledge.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is Sunnah to point with the forefinger and move it during the Tashahhud, because of the report narrated by Ahmad (18890) and al-Nasaa’i from Waa’il ibn Hajar who said: I said, I will watch how the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prays. So I watched him and he stood up and said “Allahu akbar,” and raised his hands until they were level with his ears, then he placed his right hand over his left and left wrist and left forearm. Then when he wanted to bow he raised his hands likewise. He put his hands on his knees, then when he raised his head he raised his hands likewise. Then he prostrated and put his hands level with his ears, then he sat resting on his left foot and placed his left hand on his thigh and left knee, and he put the elbow of his right hand on his right thigh. Then he made a circle with two of his fingers, then he raised his finger and I saw him moving it and making du’aa’ with it.” This hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Nasaa’i. 
Muslim (580) narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar said: When he – meaning the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) – sat during the prayer, he would place his right hand on his right thigh and clench all his fingers, and point with the finger that is next to the thumb, and he would place his left hand on his left thigh. 
According to a report narrated by Muslim from Ibn ‘Umar, when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sat during the prayer, he would put his hands on his thighs and raise the finger of his right hand that is next to the thumb, and make du’aa’ with it, and his left hand would be resting on his left thigh. 
Al-Nasaa’i (1273) narrated that Sa’d said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) passed by me whilst I was making du’aa’ with my fingers and he said, “One, one,” and pointed with his index finger. Meaning: point with one finger, namely the index finger. 
Ahmad (5964) narrated that Naafi’ said: When ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar sat during the prayer, he would put his hands on his thighs and point with his finger whilst looking at it. Then he said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “It is harder on the Shaytaan than iron,” meaning the index finger. This hadeeth was classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Sifat Salaat al-Nabi (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), p. 159. 
These ahaadeeth indicate two things: 
1 – That one should point with the finger throughout the entire Tashahhud
2 – That one should move it when making du’aa’. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) explained the phrases narrated for the du’aa’ in the Tashahhud. He said: 
Every time you make du’aa’ then move your finger towards upwards towards the One upon Whom you are calling, so we say: 
Al-salaamu ‘alayka ayyuha’l-Nabiyyu (Peace be upon you O Prophet) – you should point your finger whilst reciting this because the salaam is a kind of du’aa’. 
Al-salaamu ‘alayna (peace be upon us) – point your finger. 
Allahumma salli ‘ala Muhammad (O Allah, send prayers upon Muhammad) – point your finger. 
Allahumma baarik ‘ala Muhammad (O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad) – point your finger. 
A’oodhu Billaaih min ‘adhaabi Jahannam (I seek refuge with Allah from the torment of Hell) – point your finger. 
Wa min ‘adhaab il-qabr (and from the torment of the grave) – point your finger. 
Wa min fitnat il-mahyaa wa’l-mamaat (and from the trials of life and death) – point your finger. 
Wa min fitnat il-maseeh il-dajjaal (and from the trial of the Dajjaal) – point your finger. 
Every time you make du’aa’ point upwards towards the One upon Whom you are calling. This is closer to the Sunnah.

    to makrooh actions but also to some sins. For example, a man may be 
    committing some sins and not others. So he should start with those which are 
    more serious then move on to those that are less serious. For example, if 
    there is a person who does not pray, and he disobeys his parents or there is 
    the suspicion that he drinks alcohol, or some other sin. The one who wants 
    to advise him should start with the issue of prayer, and explain to him how 
    important it is and that not praying is kufr. If he starts to pray, then the 
    one who wants to offer advice should explain about the other wrongful 
    actions, if he thinks that there is some benefit in doing so. If he thinks 
    that denouncing all of them will not affect the goal and he hopes that

11529,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11529,Al-Ibaadiyyah,Who are the Ibaadis?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.1 – Definition. 
The Ibaadis are a group of Khaarijis who are 
    named after their founder, ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Ibaad al-Tameemi. They claim that they are not Khaarijis, and they deny this origin. But the truth is 
    that they are not extreme Khaarijis like the Azraqis, but they agree with the Khaarijis in many issues such as denying the divine attributes, 
    saying that the Qur’aan is created, and allowing rebellion against oppressive rulers. 
2 – After whom are the Ibaadis named? 
Their first founder was ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Ibaad 
    from the tribe of Banu Murrah ibn ‘Ubayd ibn Tameem.  He was named after Ibaad which is a village in al-Yamaamah known nowadays as al-‘Aarid. 
    ‘Abd-Allaah was a contemporary of Mu’aawiyah and died at the end of the reign of ‘Abd al-Maalik ibn Marwaan. 
3 – Their most important beliefs: 
·From their books it seems that they deny the divine attributes, and they agree to a large extent with 
    the Mu’tazilah in the misinterpretation of divine attributes. But they claim that their views are based on sound evidence, when they interpret the 
    divine attributes in a metaphorical sense, which explains the meaning without likening Allaah to His creation. But the truth of this matter is the 
    view of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah, who follow the evidence and affirm the names and attributes of Allaah as He Himself has affirmed them, 
    without denying them, discussing how, they are, misinterpreting them or likening Allaah to His creation.
·They deny that the believers will see Allaah in the Hereafter.
·They misinterpret some matters having to do with the Hereafter and deny that they are real, such as 
    the Balance (Meezaan) and the Siraat.
·The attributes of Allaah are not additional to His Essence, they are His Essence.
·The Qur’aan in their view is created, and they agreed with the Khaarijis in that. Al-Ash’ari said in
    Maqaalaat al-Islamiyyeen, “All the Khaarijis say that the Qur’aan was created.” Maqaalaat al-Islamiyyeen, 1/203.
·In their view the one who commits a major sin is a kaafir in the sense of being ungrateful to Allaah 
    or being a hypocrite.
·In their view people fall into three categories:
- Believers who are sincere in their faith
- Mushriks whose shirk is obvious
- People who have affirmed belief in Tawheed 
    and Islam, but who do not adhere to its practices and acts of worship, so they are not mushriks because they have affirmed belief in Tawheed, but 
    they are not believers either because they do not adhere to the requirements of faith. So they are included with the Muslims in rulings having to 
    do with this world, because of their affirmation of Tawheed, and they are included with the mushriks in rulings having to do with the Hereafter 
    because they were not sincere in their faith and they went against the requirements of Tawheed. 
·They believe that those of the people of the qiblah who differ from them are kaafirs but not 
    mushriks; it is permissible to marry them and inherit from them. Their weapons, horses and anything that may be used for war is permissible as war 
    booty and everything else is haraam.
·The one who commits a major sin is a kaafir and when he is committing sin and persisting in it, he 
    cannot be admitted to Paradise if he has not repented, for Allaah does not forgive major sins unless those who commit 
    them repent before death.
·They call the one who commits a major sin a kaafir, claiming that this is kufr in the sense of 
    ingratitude to Allaah or in the sense of hypocrisy, not in the sense that he is a kaafir who is beyond the pale of Islam. Ahl al-Sunnah 
    wa’l-Jamaa’ah on the other hand call such a person disobedient or a sinner. Whoever dies in such a state – according to Ahl al-Sunnah – is subject 
    to the will of Allaah: if He wills, He will forgive him by His grace, and if He wills, He will punish him by His justice until he is cleansed of 
    his sin, then he will be moved to Paradise. But the Ibaadis say that the sinner will abide in Hell forever, so in 
    this regard they agree with the rest of the Khaarijis and Mu’talizah who say that the sinners will abide in Hell forever.
·They deny that there will be any intercession for the sinners who are believers in Tawheed, because 
    sinners – in their view – will abide in Hell forever, so there can be no intercession for them to be brought forth from Hell.
·Some of them criticized the caliph ‘Uthmaan ibn ‘Affaan, Mu’aawiyah ibn Abi Sufyaan and ‘Amr ibn 
    al-‘Aas (may Allaah be pleased with them).","Mawsoo’ah al-Adyaan wa’l-Madhaahib al-Mu’aasirah, 1/63"

Is it permissible for me to delay Hajj?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.One of the conditions of Hajj being obligatory is being able to do it, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah) to the House (Ka‘bah) is a duty that mankind owes to Allaah, those who can afford the expenses”
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:97]
This includes being able to do it both physically and financially. 
With regard to being able to do it physically, this means being physically sound and able to endure the hardship of travelling to the Sacred House of Allaah and performing the rituals of Hajj. 
With regard to being able to do it financially, this means being able to afford the means of transportation to and from the Sacred House of Allaah. 
The Standing Committee (11/30) said: 
With regard to being able to perform Hajj, this means being physically healthy as well as having the means of transportation to the Sacred House of Allaah by plane, car or riding animal, or being able to pay for that, according to one's situation, as well as having sufficient provisions for the journey there and back. That is in addition to having enough to cover the expenses of those on whom he is obliged to spend until he returns from Hajj. A woman should also have a husband or mahram with her when travelling for Hajj or ‘Umrah. Ends. 
So it is essential that the money which one uses to travel to the Sacred House is money that is surplus to one’s basic needs, financial shar’i obligations, and any debts that may need to be paid off. Debts here refers to duties that one owes to Allaah, such as expiations, and the rights of other people. 
If a person owes a debt and he cannot afford both to perform Hajj and pay off the debt, then he should start by paying off the debt, and Hajj is not obligatory for him. Some people think that the reason is that the lender has not given him permission and that if he asks him for permission and he gives it, there is nothing wrong with that. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said (in al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 7/30): There is no basis for this notion, rather the reason is his being under an obligation. Ends. 
If the lender gives the debtor permission to go for Hajj then the debtor still owes the money, and his obligation is not discharged by him being given this permission. Hence it is said to the debtor: Pay off the debt first, then if you have enough money left to perform Hajj, do so, otherwise Hajj is not obligatory for you. 
If a debtor who did not perform Hajj because of debt dies, he will meet Allaah with his Islam complete and he will not be regarded as neglectful or heedless, because Hajj was not obligatory for him. Just as zakaah is not obligatory for one who is poor, the same applies to Hajj. 
But if he gives Hajj priority over paying off his debt and he dies before paying off the debt, then he will have made a mistake. If a martyr is forgiven everything except debt, then what about anyone other than a martyr? 
What is meant by shar’i financial obligations is expenditure that is required by sharee’ah, such as spending on oneself and one’s family, without being extravagant or wasteful. If a person is of average means but he wants to look like he is rich, so he buys an expensive car to compete with rich people, and he does not have enough money to perform Hajj, then he has to sell the car and use that money to perform Hajj, and he should buy a car that suits his means. His spending on this car is not a legitimate shar’i expense, rather it is a kind of extravagance, which is forbidden in sharee’ah. 
What matters in spending is that he should have enough to provide for himself and his family until he returns from Hajj, and he should have enough after he returns to cover his own expenses and those of the people under his care, such as rent, salaries and business, etc. 
So he does not have to perform Hajj with the capital of his business, from the profit of which he spends on himself and his family, if that reduction of his capital will result in a reduction of his profits which will mean that there will not be enough to provide for himself and his family. 
The Standing Committee (11/36) was asked about a man who had a sum of money in an Islamic bank and his salary, along with the returns from his investment, is sufficient for him to live a moderate lifestyle. Does he have to perform Hajj using that capital, knowing that this will affect his monthly income and standard of living? 
They replied: 
If your situation is as described then you are not obliged to perform Hajj because you are not able to do so according to the criteria stipulated in sharee’ah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah) to the House (Ka‘bah) is a duty that mankind owes to Allaah, those who can afford the expenses”
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:97] 
“and [Allaah] has not laid upon you in religion any hardship”
[al-Hajj 22:78] 
What is meant by basic needs is that which a person needs a great deal in his life and which it is too hard for him to do without, such as books for a seeker of knowledge. We would not tell him to sell his books and use that money to perform Hajj, because they are basic needs for him. The same applies to a car that a person needs; we would not tell him to sell it and use the money to perform Hajj. But if a person has two cars and only needs one, then he has to sell one of them and use the money to perform Hajj. 
Similarly a craftsman does not need to sell his tools, because he needs them. And a man who drives a taxi and spends on himself and his family from the money he earns from it, he does not have to sell it and perform Hajj. 
Another basic need is the need to get married. If a man has money but he needs to get married and is going to use that money to do so, then he should give priority to marriage. 
See also Question no. 27120. 
So what is meant by being financially able is that a person should have enough money to perform Hajj after paying off his debts, fulfilling his shar’i financial obligations and meeting his basic needs.",Islam Q&A

“O mankind! it is you who stand in need of Allaah. But Allaah is Rich (Free of all needs), Worthy of all praise” [Faatir 35:15]
This aayah indicates that people are in need of their Lord in all their affairs, and for their very existence and survival, to benefit them and keep them safe from all evils. Allaah is the One Who bestows all that. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning),
“Allaah is He Who created you, then provided food for you, then will cause you to die, then (again) He will give you life (on the Day of Resurrection)” [al-Room 30:40]
“And whatever of blessings and good things you have, it is from Allaah” [al-Nahl 16:53]
Allaah is free from any need of His slaves and to Him belongs all dominion and praise. His slave cannot benefit Him or harm Him. If all of them were to believe, that would not increase His dominion at all, and if they were all to disbelieve, that would not reduce His dominion at all. He is the Lord of the Worlds, the Lord of the first and the last. He is the True God, besides Whom no other is deserving of worship. Everything else that is worshipped apart from Him is false. The meaning of Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah is, there is none who is rightfully worshipped apart from Allaah. This is the correct meaning. It does not mean that there is no creator apart from Allaah, or there is none who is able to meet all needs apart from Allaah. These are also implied in its meaning, for the True God is the Creator of all things, the One Who is Able to do all things. What this shaykh said, that the meaning of Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah is “none is capable of fulfilling needs except Allaah” – if he meant that this is part of the meaning, then this is correct; but if he said that this is what is meant by it, then this is false. If what is meant by this phrase is what the shaykh said, then why did the early mushrikeen refuse to say it when the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to them, “Say Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah and you will prosper”? Because they affirmed that there was no creator besides Allaah, and they understood what was meant by this phrase, which is that there is none who is rightfully worshipped except Allaah. Allaah is the One Who is rightfully worshipped, and anything else that is worshipped apart from Him is false. This implies that the gods of the mushrikeen which they worship are false. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“That is because Allaah, He is the Truth, and that which they invoke besides Him is Al Baatil (falsehood, Satan and all other false deities); and that Allaah, He is the Most High, the Most Great” [Luqmaan 31:30]
Because the mushrikeen knew what it meant, and that it implied that their gods were false, they refused to say it, and they recommended one another to remain constant to their gods, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And the disbelievers say: ‘This (Prophet Muhammad) is a sorcerer, a liar.
Has he made the aalihah (gods) (all) into One Ilaah (God — Allaah). Verily, this is a curious thing!’
And the leaders among them went about (saying): ‘Go on, and remain constant to your aalihah (gods)! Verily, this is a thing designed (against you)!’” [Saad 38:4]
Hence you may know that what many say, which goes against what your shaykh said concerning the meaning of Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah, is what is correct.
What your shaykh said, ‘That we are in need of Allaah… ’ means that Allaah Alone is the One Who gives us life, and that is correct. But that is not the meaning of Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah. Rather what it means is that there is none who is rightfully worshipped except Allaah, as stated above. The True God is the One who deserves to be worshipped, and He is the One Who gives life and gives death, and He is Allaah, may He be exalted.
What your shaykh said, that ‘if a person could live … many people are against sufism’, if he meant that a person could do without food and drink constantly, this is a false notion, because there is no person who can do without food and drink constantly, not even the Prophets, let alone anyone else. His claim that a Sufi can live without food and drink, and that making dhikr enables him to do without that constantly, is false. If anyone among them makes such a claim, he is a liar. So do not be deceived by this shaykh, for he is either ignorant and misguided, or he is a liar and an imposter. Beware of him and his ilk.

Could you please tell me when it is good to raise one's hands in du’a? Could we raise our hands after a supererogatory prayer?,Any du`a which has not been narrated in a report and which is not part of another act of worship is regarded as general du`a; in this case there is nothing wrong with raising the hands.,"Du`a: An act of worship


Raising hands in du`a


When to raise hands in du`a


Raising hands in du`a in nafl prayer","Praise be to Allah.Du`a: An act of worship
It is important to note that du`a is an act of worship, and every act of worship should only be done on the basis of evidence. 
Raising hands in du`a
The basic principle here is that the hands should be raised when making du`a, except when the du`a is part of another act of worship, in which case raising the hands is regarded as an additional action (and should not be done). 
Examples of such acts of worship include prayer, khutbah (Friday sermon) , tawaf (circumambulation of the Ka`bah), sa`i (running between al-Safa and Marwah), etc. 
Prayer includes du`a at the beginning of the prayer, in ruku’ (bowing), when standing up from ruku’, in the two sajdahs (prostrations) and in the sitting between the two prostrations – but whoever raises his hands in these places is considered to have committed an act of bid’ah (reprehensible innovation). 
The same applies to raising the hands when making du`a on the pulpit, except in the case of istisqa (praying for rain). And the same applies when making du`a when doing tawaf or sa`i.  
When to raise hands in du`a
When there is evidence to show that it is permissible to raise the hands in certain situations, then there is no dispute. Any du`a which has not been narrated in a report and which is not part of another act of worship is regarded as general du`a; in this case there is nothing wrong with raising the hands.
Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) spoke of a man who raised his hands to the sky and said, “O Lord, O Lord,” whilst his food was haram, his drink was haram, his clothing was haram, he had been nourished with haram, so how could his du`a be answered?  
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) also said: “Allah feels shy to let His slave raise his hands to Him and bring them back empty.”  
Raising hands in du`a in nafl prayer 
With regard to raising the hands after a nafl prayer, if that is not a du`a that is regularly offered, such as when a man is faced with some emergency, and he calls upon Allah at that moment, there is nothing wrong with that. But if he regularly makes du`a and raises his hands after praying an obligatory prayer, there is no clear evidence to support doing so.

    It is not obligatory to pray Jumu’ah in this place, rather 
    you should pray Zuhr, because you are not permanent residents there and 
    there are no permanent residents with whom you can pray Jumu’ah. 

    The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked about some 
    people who left the city to work in agriculture, and they stayed there for 
    as long as the work lasted, no less than two to four months each year. It is 
    difficult for them to go back to the city to pray Jumu’ah whilst they are 
    working. Is Jumu’ah prayer obligatory for them? Is it permissible for them 
    to hold Jumu’ah prayers in their work place or not, or do they have to go to 
    the city even though that is difficult for them? Or is it waived in their 
    case as it is for travellers? What is the length of time in the workplace at 
    which Jumu’ah is waived for them? 

    They replied: 

    If the farms on which they work are permanently inhabited, 
    then they have to pray Jumu’ah, with the permanent residents. They can pray 
    with them or with others with whom it is easy for them to pray Jumu’ah, 
    because of the general meaning of the evidence which indicates that Jumu’ah 
    is obligatory and it is obligatory to make the effort to attend Jumu’ah 
    prayers. 

    If those who work on these farms can hear the adhaan for 
    Jumu’ah from their village or from another village near their farms, then 
    they must go and pray with the congregation (jamaa’ah) of the Muslims, 
    because of the general meaning of the verse in which Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “O you who believe 
    (Muslims)! When the call is proclaimed for the Salaah (prayer) on Friday 
    (Jumu‘ah prayer), come to the remembrance of Allaah [Jumu‘ah religious talk 
    (Khutbah) and Salaah (prayer)]”

    [al-Jumu’ah 63:9]
If there are no permanent 
    residents on these farms and they cannot hear the adhaan for Jumu’ah from 
    the village that is near their farm, they do not have to pray Jumu’ah but 
    they should pray Zuhr in congregation. 

    There were tribes and farms in the al-‘Awaali districts 
    around Madeenah at the time of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him), and he did not command the people there to come to 
    Jumu’ah prayers. If he had, that would have been narrated. This indicates 
    that it is not obligatory for such people because of the hardship involved.

    Jumu’ah is obligatory, you do not have to offer Jumu’ah prayers, rather you 
    have to pray Zuhr. But if the company is in a place where Jumu’ah prayers 
    are held or near such a place and you can hear the adhaan, or there are

Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may 
    Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about some students living away from 
    home and the ruling on holding Jumu’ah prayers in foreign lands. He 
    replied: 

    The scholars have stated that you and people like you do not 
    have to hold Friday prayers, and there is some dispute as to whether Friday 
    prayers offered by you are valid. Rather what you have to do is to pray 
    Zuhr, because you are more akin to travellers and those who live in the 
    desert. Jumu’ah is only obligatory for permanent residents. The evidence for 
    that is the fact that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) did not command travellers or those living in the desert to pray 
    Jumu’ah, and he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not do 
    that when he was travelling, and neither did his companions (may Allaah be 
    pleased with them). It is proven in the saheeh ahaadeeth that during the 
    Farewell Pilgrimage the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) prayed Zuhr in ‘Arafah on a Friday; he did not pray Jumu’ah or command 
    the pilgrims to do so, because they came under the ruling on travellers. I 
    do not know of any differing opinion among the scholars of Islam regarding 
    this matter, praise be to Allaah, apart from some odd views among some of 
    the Taabi’een, with which we need not concern ourselves. 

    But if there are some permanent Muslim residents who pray 
    Jumu’ah there, then it is prescribed in sharee’ah for you and others like 
    you who are staying in that place temporarily in order to seek knowledge, do 
    business, etc, to pray with them so that you may attain the virtue of 
    praying Jumu’ah. Some the scholars have stated that it is obligatory for the 
    traveller to join the permanent residents if he stays in a place where 
    Jumu’ah prayers are held and his stay exceeds the period during which 
    shortening the prayers is allowed.

          If there is a necessary reason why this 
          student should stay (with his parents), then it is better for him to 
          do so. However, he can stay with them whilst also seeking knowledge,

          he will be able to seek more knowledge by traveling, then there is nothing 
          wrong with him travelling to seek knowledge. But at the same time he 
          should not forget the rights of his parents, so he should come back

If you know that you have learned it properly, then you can move on.","From Fatawa al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, Kitab al-‘Ilm, p. 157, 158"
11562,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11562,Will a Muslim be rewarded for learning math?,"If a student learns math with the intention of seeking the pleasure of Allaah, will he be rewarded for that or not?",,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          If this math is something which will benefit the Muslims 
          in their daily lives and the person intends to benefit the people thereby, 
          then he will be rewarded according to his intention. But math is not 
          like Islamic knowledge or sharee’ah, although it is a permissible matter 
          and a means. If it is a means that will benefit the people in their 
          lives, then a person will be rewarded for it, because the Islamic principle 
          is that the category of permissible things is very broad, but one issue 
          which in principle is permissible may change to be haraam, or makrooh, 
          or mustahabb or waajib. 
 
          We may say, for example, that selling is permissible 
          in principle, but it may be mustahabb or makrooh. If a person wants 
          to buy something from you that will save his life, such as food and 
          drink, what is the ruling on selling? The ruling is that (in this case) 
          it is obligatory. But another person wants to buy grapes from you in 
          order to make wine – in this case selling is haraam. Another person 
          wants to buy water to do wudoo’ and he has no water; in this case selling 
          is obligatory. On this basis we say that if the permissible thing is 
          a means to something which is prescribed in Islam, then it is prescribed, 
          but if it is a means to something haraam then it is haraam.","From Fataawa al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, Kitaab al-‘Ilm, p. 143"
11563,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11563,Are Nashids Haram?,What is the ruling on Islamic nashids that are free of music?,"Nashids are permissible whether recited individually or in unison, but no forbidden musical instruments should be used, and they should not be the focus of the Muslim’s mind. Also, nashids should not be recited by women (in front of men), or include haram or obscene speech.",,"Praise be to Allah.The clear sahih texts indicate in a number of ways that it is permissible to recite poetry and listen to it. It was narrated in sahih reports that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his noble Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) listened to verse, recited it (as nashid) and asked others to recite it, both when they were travelling and when they stayed at home, in their gatherings and whilst they were working, individually, as in the case of Hassan ibn Thabit, ‘Amir ibn al-Akwa’ and Anjashah (may Allah be pleased with them), and in unison, as in the hadith of Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) which describes the digging of the ditch (al-khandaq). 
Anas said: When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw how exhausted and hungry we were, he said (in verse):
“O Allah, there is no life except the life of the Hereafter, so forgive the Ansar and the Muhajirin.”
And they said in response:
“We are the ones who have pledged allegiance to Muhammad, to make jihad for as long as we live.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3/1043)
And in gatherings too: Ibn Abi Shaybah narrated with a hasan isnad that Abu Salamah ibn ‘Abd al-Rahman said: “The Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not speak in devious tones or in a soft manner. They used to recite verses in their gatherings, denouncing the affairs of their jahiliyyah, but if it was the matter of their religion, they would become very serious and cautious (8/711).  
This evidence indicates that nashids are permissible , whether recited individually or in unison. The word nashid in Arabic means raising the voice when reciting verse and making the voice sound beautiful and gentle.
There are conditions to which attention must be paid with regard to this matter: Not using forbidden musical instruments in nashid. Not doing it too much or making it the focus of the Muslim’s mind , occupying all his time, or neglecting obligatory duties because of it.
 Nashid should not be recited by women , or include haram or obscene speech.
They should not resemble the tunes of the people of immorality and promiscuity. They should be free of vocal effects that produce sounds like those of musical instruments. They should not have moving tunes which make the listener feel “high” as happens to those who listen to songs. This is the case with many of the nashids which appear nowadays, so that the listeners no longer pay any attention to the good meaning of the words, because they are so entranced by the tunes. 
And Allah is the Source of strength.

Prophet Muhammad: Exalted example of character","Praise be to Allah.Why did Allah send Prophet Muhammad?
Differences and disputes arose among the Children of Israel. They introduced alterations and changes in their beliefs and laws. Thus truth was extinguished and falsehood prevailed, oppression and evil became widespread, and people needed a religion that would establish truth, destroy evil and guide people to the straight path, therefore Allah sent Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) as Allah said (interpretation of the meaning):
“And We have not sent down the Book (the Quran) to you (O Muhammad), except that you may explain clearly unto them those things in which they differ, and (as) a guidance and a mercy for a folk who believe.” [al-Nahl 16:64]
Allah sent all the Prophets and Messengers to call for the worship of Allah alone, and to bring people from darkness to light. The first of these Messengers was Nuh and the last of them was Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) as Allah said (interpretation of the meaning):  
“And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (community, nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): ‘Worship Allah (Alone), and avoid (or keep away from) Taghut (all false deities, i.e. do not worship Taghut besides Allah).’” [al-Nahl 16:36]
Is Prophet Muhammad the last prophet?
The last of the Prophets and Messengers is Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), so there is no Prophet after him, as Allah said: 
“Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but he is the Messenger of Allah and the last (end) of the Prophets.” [al-Ahzab 33:40]
Every Prophet was sent exclusively to his own people, but Allah sent His Messenger Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to all of mankind as Allah said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allah revealed to His messenger the Quran by which to guide people And We have not sent you (O Muhammad) except as a giver of glad tidings and a Warner to all mankind, but most of men know not” [Saba 34:28]
Why did Allah send the Quran?
Allah sent the Quran to His Messenger, to guide people and bring them forth from darkness to light by the will of their Lord. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“(This is) a Book which We have revealed unto you (O Muhammad) in order that you might lead mankind out of darkness (of disbelief and polytheism) into light (of belief in the Oneness of Allah and Islâmic Monotheism) by their Lord’s Leave to the path of the All Mighty, the Owner of all praise” [Ibrahim 14:1]
When was Prophet Muhammad born?
The Messenger of Allah, Muhammad ibn ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib al-Hashimi al-Qurashi was born in Makkah in the year of the Elephant, the year when the companions of the Elephant came to Makkah to destroy the Ka’bah, but Allah destroyed them. 
His father died before he was born, and after he was born, Haleemah al-Sa’diyyah nursed him. When he was six years old, he visited his maternal uncles in Madinah with his mother Aminah bint Wahb. On the way back to Makkah, his mother died in al-Abwa. 
Then his grandfather ‘Abd al-Muttalib became his guardian. But ‘Abd al-Muttalib died when Muhammad was eight years old. Then his paternal uncle Abu Talib became his guardian. He took care of him, treated him kindly and defended him for more than forty years, but when Abu Talib died he had not come to believe in the religion of Muhammad lest he be reproached by Quraysh for abandoning the religion of his forefathers 
What was Prophet Muhammad’s profession?
When he was young, Muhammad used to tend sheep for the people of Makkah, then he traveled to Syria to do business on behalf of Khadeejah bint Khuwaylid, and he made a good profit. Khadijah was impressed with his character, and his sincerity and honesty, so he married her when he was twenty-five, and she was forty, and he did not marry any other woman until after she died. 
Prophet Muhammad’s character before prophethood
Allah made Muhammad grow in a good manner, and Allah took care of him, so he was the best of his people in physical wellbeing and in attitude, he was the most generous, the most patient, the most truthful, the most sincere and the most honest, so his people called him al-Amin (the trustworthy) . 
Then he was given an inclination towards solitude, so he used to spend many days and nights alone in the cave of Hira, worshiping and praying to his Lord. He hated idols, alcohol and promiscuous conduct, so he never paid any attention to them all his life 
When Muhammad reached the age of thirty-five he took part in the rebuilding of the Ka’bah, which had been destroyed by a flood. A dispute arose concerning who should put the Black Stone back in its place, and they appointed him as an arbitrator to resolve the dispute, so he called for a garment and placed the stone on it then he told the tribal chiefs to hold the garment at the edges so that all of them could lift it together, then Muhammad put it in place and put stones and mortar around it. 
What did the people of Arabia believe before Islam?
The people of the Jahiliyyah used to have some good characteristics such as generosity, loyalty and courage, and they used to follow some teachings of the religion of Ibrahim, such as venerating the Ka’bah and making Tawaf around it, performing Hajj and ‘Umrah, and offering sacrifices. But besides that they used to have some bad habits and traditions, such as fornication, drinking alcohol, consuming riba (usury or interest), killing their daughters, oppression and worshiping idols. 
The first one to introduce changes in the religion of Ibrahim, and to call for the worship of idols was ‘Amr ibn Luhayy al-Khuza’i, who brought idols to Makkah and other places, and called people to worship them. Among these idols were Wudd, Suwa’, Yaghooth, Ya’uq, and Nasra. 
Later on, the Arabs also worshipped other idols such as the idol of Manat in a place called Qadeed, and al-Lat in al-Taif, al-‘Uzza in Wadi Nakhlah, Hubal inside the Ka’bah, and other idols around the Ka’bah, and idols in their homes. People used to consult soothsayers, fortune tellers and magicians to judge between them. 
When was Prophet Muhammad called for prophethood?
When shirk and corruption became so widespread, Allah sent Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), when he was forty years old, to call the people to worship Allah Alone and to give up idol-worship. Quraysh denounced him for that and said:
“Has he made the alihah (gods) (all) into One Ilah (God — Allah). Verily, this is a curious thing!” [Saad 38:5 – interpretation of the meaning]
These idols continued to be worshipped instead of Allah until Allah sent His Messenger Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) with the Message of Tawheed (Oneness of Allah). So he and his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) broke them and destroyed them, truth prevailed and falsehood was vanquished:
“And say: ‘Truth (i.e. Islamic Monotheism or this Quran on Jihad against polytheists) has come and Batil (falsehood, i.e. Satan or polytheism) has vanished. Surely, Batil is ever bound to vanish’” [al-Israa’ 17:81 – interpretation of the meaning]
An account of the first revelation to Prophet Muhammad 
The first revelation that was sent down to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was in the cave of Hira where he used to go to worship, when Jibril came to him and commanded him to read. The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “I am not a reader.” This happened again, and on the third time, he said to him:
“Read! In the Name of your Lord Who has created (all that exists).
He has created man from a clot (a piece of thick coagulated blood).
Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous” [al-‘Alaq 96:1-3 – interpretation of the meaning]
The Messenger went back home, his heart pounding. He entered upon his wife Khadijah and told her what had happened, saying “I feared for myself.” She calmed him down and said, “By Allah, Allah will never forsake you, for you uphold the ties of kinship, help the weak, honour your guests, give in charity and help when someone is stricken with calamity.” Then she went with him to her cousin Waraqah ibn Nawfal, who had become a Christian. When he told him what had happened, he gave him glad tidings and told him, this is the Namus whom Allah sent to Musa. He encouraged him to be patient if his people persecuted him and expelled him. Then the wahy stopped for a while, and the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was saddened by that. Then whilst he was walking one day, he saw the angel again, between the heavens and the earth. He went back to his house and wrapped himself in his blanket. Then Allah revealed the words (interpretation of the meaning):
“O you (Muhammad) enveloped in garments! Arise and warn!” [al-Muddaththir 74:1-2]
After that, revelations came one after another to the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
What were the stages of Prophet Muhammad’s mission?
The Prophet stayed in Makkah for thirteen years, calling for the worship of Allah alone, in secret then openly, when Allah commanded him to proclaim the truth. So he called them in a gentle and kind manner, without fighting. He called his clan and closest relatives, then he warned his people and those around them, then he warned all the Arabs, then he warned all of mankind. Then Allah said: 
“Therefore proclaim openly (Allah's Message Islamic Monotheism) that which you are commanded, and turn away from Al Mushrikun (polytheists, idolaters, and disbelievers)” [al-Hijr 15:94]
A few people, rich people, nobles, the weak and poor, men and women, believed in the Messenger. All of them were persecuted for their faith. Some were tortured and some were killed. Some of them migrated to Abyssinia, fleeing from the persecution of Quraysh, and some of them were persecuted with the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), until Allah caused His religion to prevail. 
When the Messenger reached the age of fifty and ten years of his mission had passed, his uncle Abu Talib, who had protected him from the persecution of Quraysh, died. Then his wife Khadهjah, who had been his consolation, also died, and the persecution of his people intensified. They harassed him and persecuted him with all kinds of torments, and he bore it with patience, seeking the reward of Allah. May the blessings and peace of Allaah be upon him. 
Prophet Muhammad’s visit to al-Taif
When the persecution of Quraysh became too intense, he went out to al-Taif and called its people to Islam but they did not respond; instead they insulted him and threw stones at him, until his heels started to bleed. He went back to Makkah and continued to call his people to Islam during Hajj and at other times. 
Prophet Muhammad’s Night Journey 
Then Allah took His Messenger on the Night Journey from al-Masjid al-Haram in Makkah to al-Masjid al-Aqsa (in Jerusalem), riding on al-Buraq, accompanied by Jibril. He stopped and led the prophets in prayer, then he was taken up into the lowest heaven, where he saw Adam, with the souls of the blessed to his right and the souls of the doomed to his left. Then he was taken up to the second heaven where he saw ‘Isa and Yahya; then to the third heaven where he saw Yusuf; then to the fourth heaven where he saw Idris; then to the fifth heaven where he saw Harun; then to the sixth heaven where he saw Musa; then to the seventh heaven where he saw Ibrahim. 
Then he was taken up to Sidrat al-Muntaha (the Lote-tree of the utmost boundary), and his Lord spoke to him and enjoined fifty prayers upon him and his ummah each day and night. Then that was reduced to five prayers to be performed, with a reward for fifty, and the prayer was confirmed to be five prayers each day and night for the ummah of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Then he returned to Makkah before dawn came, and he told them what had happened to him. The believers believed him but the kafirs did not. 
“Glorified (and Exalted) be He (Allah) [above all that (evil) they associate with Him]
Who took His slave (Muhammad) for a journey by night from Al-Masjid Al-Haram (at Makkah) to Al Masjid Al Aqsa (in Jerusalem), the neighbourhood whereof We have blessed, in order that We might show him (Muhammad) of Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, lessons, signs, etc.). Verily, He is the All Hearer, the All Seer.” [al-Isra 17:1 – interpretation of the meaning]
Some tribes accept Islam
Then Allah sent to His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) people who would help and support him.  During the Hajj season, he met a group from the tribe of Khazraj in Madinah. They embraced Islam, then they went back to Madinah and spread Islam there. The following year, they were over ten people, whom the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) met, and when they left he sent Mus’ab ibn ‘Umayr with them to teach them the Quran and Islam. Many people became Muslim through him, including the leaders of the tribe of Aws, Sa’d ibn Mu’adh and Usayd ibn Hudayr. 
The following year when the Hajj season came, more than seventy men from al-Aws and al-Khazraj came and invited the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to come to Madinah after the people of Makkah had persecuted him and boycotted him. During the night of one of the days of Tashreeq, the Messenger made an appointment to meet them at ‘Aqabah. When one third of the night had passed, they came out to meet him and found the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), accompanied by his uncle al-'Abbas, who was not a believer, but he wanted to take care of his nephew’s affairs. Al-'Abbas, the Messenger and the people spoke together in a pleasant manner, then the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)  accepted their oath of allegiance on the basis that he would migrate to them in Madinah and they would protect him, support him and defend him, and Paradise would be theirs in return. They gave their oath of allegiance, one by one, then they left. Quraysh found out about them, so they set out in pursuit of them. But Allah saved them from them, and the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) remained in Makkah for a while: 
“Verily, Allaah will help those who help His (Cause). Truly, Allah is All Strong, All Mighty” [al-Hajj 22:40 – interpretation of the meaning]
An account of Prophet Muhammad’s Migration to Madinah
Then the Messenger commanded his Companions to migrate to Madinah , so they migrated in groups except for those who were prevented from doing so by the mushrikeen. Then there were no Muslims left in Makkah apart from the Messenger of Allah, Abu Bakr and ‘Ali. When the mushrikeen realized that the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had migrated to Madinah, they feared that he would join them and become strong. So they agreed to kill him. Jibril told the Messenger of Allah about that, so the Messenger commanded ‘Ali to sleep in his bed, and he returned the things that had been entrusted to the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to their owners. The mushrikeen spent the night at the door of the Messenger, waiting to kill him when he came out, but he came out in the midst of them and went to the house of Abu Bakr, after Allah had saved him from their plot. And Allah revealed the words (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And (remember) when the disbelievers plotted against you (O Muhammad) to imprison you, or to kill you, or to get you out (from your home, i.e. Makkah); they were plotting and Allah too was plotting; and Allah is the Best of those who plot” [al-Anfal 8:30]
Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) resolved to migrate to Madinah, so he and Abu Bakr set out to the cave of Thawr and stayed there for three nights. They hired ‘Abd-Allah ibn Abi Urayqit, who was a mushrik, as their guide, and they let him lead their camels.  Quraysh was alarmed when he left, and they looked for him everywhere, but Allah protected His Messenger. When the search for them died down, they travelled to Madinah.
When Quraysh despaired of finding them, they offered to anyone who could bring one or both of them to them two hundred camels. So the people intensified their search and on the way to Madinah, Suraqah ibn Malik found them; he was a mushrik and he set out after them, so the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed against him and his horse’s legs sank into the ground. So he realized that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was protected, so he asked the Messenger to pray for him and said that he would not harm him. So the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed for him and Suraqah went back, and diverted the people away from them. Then he became Muslim after the conquest of Makkah. 
How was Prophet Muhammad received in Madinah?
When the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) reached Madinah, the Muslims exclaimed “Allahu akbar!” with joy at his coming. Men, women and children came out to meet him, rejoicing. He stayed in Quba, where he and the Muslims built the mosque of Quba. He stayed there for over ten nights, then he rode on Friday and prayed Jumu’ah amongst Bani Salim ibn ‘Awf, then he rode his camel and entered Madinah, with the people all around him taking the reins of his camel so that he would come and stay with them. The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told them to leave her, for she would be guided (by Allah), so she walked on until she sat down in the place where the Mosque is today. 
Allah made it possible for His Messenger to stay with his maternal uncles near the mosque, so he stayed in the house of Abu Ayyub al-Ansari, then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sent someone to bring his family and his daughters, and the family of Abu Bakr, from Makkah, and thus he brought them to Madinah. 
Then the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his Companions started to build his mosque in the place where the camel had sat down. He made the qiblah facing towards Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem). Its pillars were made of tree trunks and its roof was made of palm branches. Then the qiblah was changed to the Ka’bah more than ten months after he had come to Madinah. 
Prophet Muhammad’s treaty with the Jews of Madinah
Then the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) established brotherhood (mua-khah) between the Muhajireen and the Anaar. The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) made a treaty with the Jews and wrote a document agreeing to peace and to defend Madinah. The Jewish scholar ‘Abd-Allah ibn Salam became Muslim but most of the Jews insisted on remaining kafirs. In that year the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)  married ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her). 
In the second year, the adhan was prescribed, and Allah changed the qiblah to the Ka’bah, and the fast of Ramadan was enjoined. 
Permission to fight those who fought against Muslims
The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) remained in Madinah and Allah supported him with His help. The Muhajirun and Anaar consolidated their ranks around him, and their hearts were devoted to him. The mushrikun, Jews and hypocrites came together to oppose him; they slandered him and fabricated lies against him, and they declared war on him, but Allah commanded him to be patient, forbearing and tolerant.  When their evildoing became too intense, Allah gave the Muslims permission to fight, and the ayah was revealed (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Permission to fight (against disbelievers) is given to those (believers) who are fought against, because they have been wronged; and surely, Allah is Able to give them (believers) victory.” [al-Hajj 22:39]
Then Allah enjoined the Muslims to fight those who fought against them: 
“And fight in the way of Allah those who fight you, but transgress not the limits. Truly, Allah likes not the transgressors” [al-Baqarah 2:190 – interpretation of the meaning]
Then Allah commanded them to fight all the mushrikeen: 
“and fight against the Mushrikun (polytheists, pagans, idolaters, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah) collectively as they fight against you collectively.” [al-Tawbah 9:36 – interpretation of the meaning]
The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his Companions began to call people to Allah and to strive in jihad for the sake of Allah. He foiled the plots of their enemies and relieved the oppression of the oppressed. Allah supported them with His help, until the religion was all for Allah. 
Battles of Prophet Muhammad
He fought the mushrikeen at Badr in 2 AH, in Ramadan, and Allah granted him victory over them and he defeated them. In 3 AH the Jews of Bani Qainuqa' committed treason by killing one of the Muslims, so the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) expelled them from Madinah to Syria. Then Quraysh avenged their dead who were slain at Badr. They camped around Uhud in Shawwal of the year 3 AH. Battle raged and the archers disobeyed the command of the Messenger, so the Muslims did not achieve victory, but the mushrikun went back to Makkah without having entered Madinah. 
Then the Jews of Bani al-Nudayr committed treason and resolved to kill the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) by throwing a rock on him, but Allah saved him. Then he besieged them in 4 AH and expelled them to Khaybar.  
In 5 AH the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) attacked Bani al-Mustalaq in order to repel their aggression. He was victorious over them, and took their wealth and their women and children as booty. Then the Jewish leaders tried to incite the Confederates (al-Ahzab) against the Muslims, in order to put an end to Islam in its heartland. So the mushrikun, al-Ahbash and the Jewish tribe of Ghatafan gathered around Madinah, but Allah foiled their plot and granted victory to His Messenger and the believers: 
“And Allah drove back those who disbelieved in their rage: they gained no advantage (booty). Allah sufficed for the believers in the fighting (by sending against the disbelievers a severe wind and troops of angels). And Allah is Ever All Strong, All Mighty” [al-Ahzab 33:25 – interpretation of the meaning]
Then the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) besieged the Jews of Bani Qurayzah , because of their betrayal and their breaking the treaty. Allah granted him victory over them so he killed their men, took their women and children prisoner, and took their wealth as booty. 
In 6 AH, the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) resolved to visit the Ka’bah and perform Tawaf around it, but the mushrikun prevented him from doing so. He entered into a treaty with them at al-Hudaybiyah, to stop the fighting for ten years, during which time the people would be safe and could choose what they wanted. Then the people entered Allah’s religion in crowds [cf. al-Nasr 110:2]. 
In 7 AH, the Messenger attacked Khaybar in order to put an end to the Jewish leaders who were harming the Muslims. He besieged them, and Allah gave him victory over them. He took their wealth and land as booty, and he sent letters to the kings of the earth, inviting them to Islam. 
In 8 AH, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sent an army, led by Zayd ibn Harithah, to deal with the aggressors. But the Romans gathered a huge army and killed the Muslim commanders, but Allah saved the rest of the Muslims from their evil. 
Then the kuffar of Makkah broke the treaty, so the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) headed towards them with a great army and conquered Makkah. He cleansed the Ka’bah of idols and freed it from the custodianship of the kuffar. 
Then came the campaign of Hunayn in Shawwal of 8 AH, to repel the aggression of Thaqeef and Hawazen. Allah defeated them and the Muslims captured a lot of booty. Then the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) continued his march to al-Taif and besieged it, but Allah did not decree that it should be conquered, so the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed for them, then went away. They subsequently became Muslim, then he went back and distributed the war-booty. Then he and his Companions performed ‘Umrah, then they went back to Madinah. 
In 9 AH the campaign of Tabuk came at a time of difficulty, hardship and intense heat. The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went to Tabuk in order to defeat the plots of the Romans. He camped there, but no fighting took place, but he made a treaty with some of the tribes. He captured war-booty, then he came back to Madinah.  This was the last military campaign in which he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) fought. 
In the same year delegations came from the tribes, wanting to enter Islam. Among them were the delegations from Tameem, Tayy, ‘Abd al-Qays and Bani Hanifah. They all became Muslim, then the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded Abu Bakr to lead the people in Hajj that year. He sent ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) with him and told him to recite Surah Bara-ah [al-Tawbah] to them, to declare disavowal (bara-ah) of the mushrikun. He told him to call out to the people, so ‘Ali said on the Day of Sacrifice: “O people, no kafir will enter Paradise, and no mushrik will perform Hajj after this year, and no naked person shall perform Tawaf around the Ka’bah. Whoever has a treaty with the Messenger of Allah, then the treaty will stand until it expires.” 
Conquest of Makkah
In 10 AH, the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) resolved to perform Hajj, and he called the people to do likewise. Many people from Madinah and elsewhere performed Hajj with him. He entered ihram at Dhu’l-Hulayfah and reached Makkah in Dhu’l-Hijjah. He performed Tawaf and Sa’i, and he taught the people their rituals.
The Farewell sermon of Prophet Muhammad
He gave a great and comprehensive sermon at ‘Arafah, in which he affirmed the just rulings of Islam. He said: 
“O people, listen to my words, for I do not know if I will meet you again after this year. O people, your blood, your wealth and your honour are sacred to you as the sanctity of this day of yours, in this month of yours, in this land of yours. Every practice of the jahiliyyah is beneath my feet and the blood feuds of the jahiliyyah are cancelled. The first claim of blood that I abolish is that of Ibn Rabi'ah ibn al-Harith, who was suckled among the tribe of Bani Sa’d and was killed by Hudhayl. The riba of the jahiliyyah is abolished, and the first riba that I abolish is that of ‘Abbas ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib. It is abolished completely. 
Fear Allah concerning women, for you have taken them on the security of Allah and have made their bodies lawful to you by the words of Allah.  Your right over them is that they should not allow anyone whom you dislike to sit on your bed. If they do that, then hit them, but not severely. Their rights over you are that you should be kind to them and clothe them properly.  
I have left you with something which, if you adhere to it, you will not go astray after I am gone: the Book of Allah. If you were asked about me, what would you say?” They said: “We would bear witness that you have conveyed (the message), fulfilled (the trust) and advised us sincerely.” Then he pointed with his index finger towards the sky and then towards the people, and said, “O Allah, bear witness, O Allah bear witness,” three times. 
When Allah perfected this religion and its basic principles had been established, Allah revealed to him in ‘Arafah: 
“This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion.” [al-Maidah 5:3 – interpretation of the meaning]
This Hajj is called Hajjat al-Wada’ (the Farewell Pilgrimage) because in it the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) bade farewell to the people, and he did not perform Hajj after that. Then after completing his Hajj, the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) returned to Madinah, 
When did Prophet Muhammad die?
In 11 AH, in the month of Safar, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) fell sick. When the pain became too intense, he told Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) to lead the people in prayer. In Rabi’ al-Awwal, his sickness became worse and he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) died in the morning of Monday 12 Rabi’ al-Awwal 11 AH. 
The Muslims were grief-stricken by that. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was washed (ghusl) and the Muslims offered the funeral prayer for him on the 13th, in the evening, and he was buried in the house of ‘Aishah. The Messenger died, but his religion will remain until the Day of Resurrection. 
Then the Muslims chose the one who had been his Companion in the cave and during the Hijrah, Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) to be their khalifah. After him, the position of khalifah passed to ‘Umar, then to ‘Uthman, then to ‘Ali. These are the Khulafa al-Raashidun (the Rightly-Guided Khalifahs), may Allah be pleased with them all. 
Prophet Muhammad: Exalted example of character 
Allah blessed His Messenger Muhammad greatly and enjoined upon him noble characteristics, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Did He not find you (O Muhammad) an orphan and gave you a refuge? And He found you unaware (of the Quran, its legal laws and Prophethood) and guided you? And He found you poor and made you rich (self sufficient with self contentment)? Therefore, treat not the orphan with oppression. And repulse not the beggar. And proclaim the Grace of your Lord (i.e. the Prophethood and all other Graces)” [al-Duha 93:6-11]
Allah honoured His Messenger with noble characteristics which were not combined in any other person, to the extent that his Lord praised him for these characteristics: 
“And verily, you (O Muhammad) are on an exalted standard of character” [al-Qalam 68:4 – interpretation of the meaning]
With these noble and praiseworthy characteristics, he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was able to bring people together and soften their hearts, by Allah’s leave: 
“And by the Mercy of Allah, you dealt with them gently. And had you been severe and harsh hearted, they would have broken away from about you; so pass over (their faults), and ask (Allah’s) forgiveness for them; and consult them in the affairs. Then when you have taken a decision, put your trust in Allah, certainly, Allah loves those who put their trust (in Him)” [Al ‘Imran 3:159 – interpretation of the meaning]
Allah sent His Messenger Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to all of mankind. He revealed to him the Quran and commanded him to call people to Allah, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O Prophet (Muhammad)! Verily, We have sent you as witness, and a bearer of glad tidings, and a warner, And as one who invites to Allah [Islamic Monotheism, i.e. to worship none but Allah (Alone)] by His Leave, and as a lamp spreading light (through your instructions from the Quran and the Sunnah the legal ways of the Prophet” [al-Ahzab 33:46]
Allah favoured His Messenger Muhammad over the other Prophets in six ways, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: 
“I have been favoured above the other Prophets in six ways: I have been given the ability of concise speech; I have been supported with fear [in the hearts of my enemies]; war booty has been made permissible for me; the earth has been made pure and a mosque [place of worship] for me; I have been sent to all of mankind; and I am the seal of the Prophets.” (Narrated by Muslim, 523)
All of mankind must believe in him and follow his shari’ah in order to enter the Paradise of their Lord: 
“and whosoever obeys Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad) will be admitted to Gardens under which rivers flow (in Paradise), to abide therein, and that will be the great success” [al-Nisa 4:13 – interpretation of the meaning]
Allah praises those among the People of the Book who believe in the Messenger, and He gives them the glad tidings of a two-fold reward, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Those to whom We gave the Scripture [i.e. the Tawrat (Torah) and the Injil (Gospel)] before it, they believe in it (the Quran).
And when it is recited to them, they say: ‘We believe in it. Verily, it is the truth from our Lord. Indeed even before it we have been from those who submit themselves to Allah in Islam as Muslims (like ‘Abdullâh bin Salâm and Salmân Al Farisî).
These will be given their reward twice over, because they are patient, and repel evil with good, and spend (in charity) out of what We have provided them” [al-Qasas 28:52-54]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There are three who will be given a two-fold reward: a man from among the People of the Book who believed in his prophet then lived until the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and believed in him and followed him – he will have two rewards…”

11576,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11576,A student is asking about zakaah; her income is $400 per month,I am a student who wishes to know when Zakat is due? If I make about $200-$300 dollars every two weeks do I have to pay Zakat? What is the minimum money a person has to make in order to pay Zakat? Where do I give Zakat to? Does it have to be to a muslim/ and please give me examples of places in Kaafir countries where I can give Zakat (ex. mosques),,,"Praise be to Allah.1-The time when zakaah 
  is due is when you have kept the money for a whole year. Then zakaah becomes 
  due, and the rate is 2.5%. This amount that you get every two weeks is not subject 
  to zakaah unless you have kept it for a whole year, or it is income from a business 
  for which the time has come to pay zakaah. 
2-Pay your zakaah 
  in the country in which you live, if there are poor people there. If there is 
  another country where there are poor people who are in greater need than people 
  in your country, then it is OK to give your zakaah to them. 
3-Yes, the one who 
  receives the zakaah has to be Muslim, except in the case where there is a kaafir 
  whom we want to encourage to become Muslim. If we think that that is most likely 
  to encourage him to become Muslim, it is permissible for us to give zakaah to 
  him.  
Shaykh 
  Sa’d al-Humayd.  
This 
  applies if that kaafir has a high status among the kuffaar and we hope that 
  by his becoming Muslim his people, tribe or clan will also become Muslims.  
The lowest amount at 
  which zakaah becomes due varies according to the type of wealth, whether it 
  is gold or silver. You are undoubtedly asking about an amount of currency such 
  as dollars. It appears that the amount mentioned in the question will be subject 
  to zakaah if it is kept for a whole year, because it is more than the nisaab.

For example right now I am ill and I have a very strange period,I asked him to take me to the doctors and he refused he doesn't think it is nessary even though I have told him that I think I am pragnant and it might harm the baby. He just says its in the hands of Allah (which I agree) But dont we have to take the nessary steps to take care of our selves? A thing to note is I am not allowed out with out him (which I'm glad for) but that means I cant go to the doctor by myself. After 8 days of having a strange period and feeling ill he is finelly taking me By the Mercy of Allah. Also if I approch him for my needs in the bed he gets angry and tells me that woman from back home would never do such a thing (back home being Arabic country)

With 
          regard to the second matter, according to Islam there is nothing wrong

          to them. But if you cannot convince him then in both your interests,

By getting married a person can, with the help of Allah, overcome many of the traps of evil, for marriage helps him to lower his gaze and guard his chastity. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said in the Hadith, “O young men, whoever among you can afford it, let him get married , for it is more effective in lowering the gaze and guarding chastity…” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)

It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘If any one of you feels something in his stomach, and he is not sure whether anything came out of him or not, let him not leave the mosque unless he hears a sound or detects an odour.’” (Narrated by Muslim, 362)
It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn Zayd said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was told about a man who imagined that he felt something whilst he was praying. He said, ‘Let him  not stop [praying] unless he hears a sound or detects an odour.’” (Agreed upon). 
Imaam al-Nawawi said in Sharh Muslim, 4/49: this hadeeth forms one of the basic principles of Islam and an important principle of fiqh. Things are judged to remain as they are until there is certainty that a change has occurred, and having doubts does not alter the fact.
It is not considered to be najaasah until it emerges. Sounds may come from a person’s stomach as the result of food being moved (along the digestive tract). If the worshipper hears a sound inside his stomach but nothing comes out of him that would break his wudu, and he does not note anything that would indicate that, such as hearing a sound or smelling an odour, then he should not pay any attention to it, because the basic principle is that he remains taahir (pure). So his wudu is not broken and he should not stop praying unless he is certain that something has come out of him, because what is certain is not overruled by what is doubtful.
