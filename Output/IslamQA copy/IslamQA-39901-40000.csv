    The internet may be used for both halaal and haraam purposes, 
    for both good and evil. If you can control the place and prevent people from 
    using the internet in haraam ways, then the income that comes from this café 
    is halaal. 

    But if the owner of the café is careless about denouncing 
    evil actions of his customers and he does not prevent them from doing haraam 
    things, then he is a sinner, because he does not denounce evil and he 
    cooperates with them in sin. In that case his income is evil and is haraam.

39923,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39923,He looks for bad sites to send them to the centre which will block them. Is this good or bad?,I was searching the web hunting down the unethical sites and sind them to king abdulaziz city of sciences and technology to block them not to be seen . is this work for me or against me as a moslem ?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
      This brother is to be commended for his protective jealousy 
      regarding haraam things and for his hatred of sin and desire to combat it 
      and rid the people of its evils. But we do not advise him to look for bad 
      sites in order to tell the centre to block them. That is for many reasons, 
      including the following: 

    1 – the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) has informed us of and warned us against the temptation (fitnah) of 
    women. Undoubtedly the fitnah of naked women in different poses is very 
    great. 

    It was narrated that Usaamah ibn Zayd (may Allaah be pleased 
    with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) said: “I have not left behind me any fitnah that is more 
    harmful to men than women.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4808; Muslim, 2740. 

    2 – The Muslim is commanded to keep away from places of 
    fitnah and to flee from places where it is present and shun its people. 
    Undoubtedly seeking out these sites goes against all of that. 

    It was narrated that ‘Imraan ibn Husayn (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever hears of the Dajjaal, let him flee from 
    him, for by Allaah, a man may come to him thinking that he is a believer, 
    then follow him because of the specious arguments that he presents.” 
    Narrated by Abu Dawood, 4319; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh 
    al-Jaami’, 6301. 

    Ibn al-Jawzi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
Beware – may Allaah have 
    mercy on you – of exposing yourself to the causes of calamity, for it is 
    unlikely that those who approach fitnah will be safe from it. Just as 
    caution leads to being safe, so too exposing oneself to fitnah leads to 
    doom, and it is rare that one remains safe from fitnah when approaching it; 
    even those who are safe from fitnah when they approach it will not be safe 
    from thinking about it or being influenced by it. 

    Dhamm al-Hawa, p. 126 

    3– The Muslim is commanded to lower his gaze and avoid 
    looking at haraam things; checking on these permissive websites and what is 
    in them goes against this command. 

    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking 
    at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual 
    acts). That is purer for them. Verily, Allaah is All‑Aware of what they do”

    [al-Noor 24:30]

    Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    This is a command from Allaah to His believing slaves to 
    lower their gaze and avoid looking at that which is forbidden to them, so 
    they should not look at anything except that which Allaah has permitted them 
    to look at. If their gaze happens to fall upon something haraam, then it is 
    unanimously agreed (among the scholars) that if a person’s gaze falls upon 
    something haraam unintentionally, then he should look away immediately. It 
    was narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh that Jareer ibn ‘Abd-Allaah 
    al-Bajali (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: I asked the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about an accidental glance, and 
    he told me to look away. 

    Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 3/282 
4 -  The saheeh text 
    states that it is forbidden for a man to look at the ‘awrah of another man, 
    so what about a man looking at the ‘awrah of a woman? 

    It was narrated from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri that the Messenger 
    of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No man 
    should look at the ‘awrah of another man, and no woman should look at the 
    ‘awrah of another woman.” 

    Narrated by Muslim, 338. 

    5 – The Muslim is forgiven the first glance, but repeatedly 
    looking at corrupt sites goes against that. 

    It was narrated that Buraydah ibn al-Husayb said: The 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to 
    ‘Ali: “O ‘Ali, do not follow one glance with another; you are forgiven the 
    first but not the second.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2777; Abu Dawood, 2149. 
    classed as hasan by Shaykh al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Targheeb, 1903. 

    It was narrated that Jareer ibn ‘Abd-Allaah said: I asked the 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about 
    an accidental glance, and he told me to look away. Narrated by Muslim, 
    2159. 

    Al-Nawawi said: 

    What is meant by an accidental glace is if one's gaze falls 
    upon a non-mahram woman accidentally; there is no sin in that initially, but 
    he must look away immediately. If he looks away immediately, there is no sin 
    on him, but if he persists in looking, then he has sinned, because of this 
    hadeeth, for the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    commanded him to look away. And Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking 
    at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual 
    acts)…”

    [al-Noor 24:30]
    Men must lower their gaze and avoid looking at women at all times, except 
    for sound and legitimate purposes, namely testimony, medical treatment, 
    proposing marriage, buying a slave girl, buying and selling, etc. In these 
    cases it is permitted to look only as much as is necessary and no more. And 
    Allaah knows best. 

    Sharh Muslim, 14/139 

    6 – The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) called a forbidden glance the “adultery of the eye”. In addition to it 
    being haraam in the sense of transgressing the limits with regard to 
    looking, it is also an act of ingratitude for the gift of sight that Allaah 
    has bestowed upon the Muslim. 

    It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah has decreed for 
    the son of Adam his share of zina (adultery), which will inevitably happen. 
    The zina of the eyes is looking, the zina of the tongue is speaking; the 
    heart hopes and wishes for that and the private parts confirm it or deny 
    it.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5899; Muslim, 2657. 

    Al-Nawawi said: 

    What this hadeeth means is that a share of zina is decreed 
    for the son of Adam; in some cases zina will be in a real sense, namely 
    unlawful sexual relations; in other cases it will be zina in a metaphorical 
    sense, by looking at haraam things, or listening to stories of zina and 
    things that have to do with it, or by touching a non-mahram woman with his 
    hand or kissing her, or by walking to zina, or looking, or touching, or 
    speaking in haraam ways with a non-mahram woman, and so on, or by thinking 
    of it in one’s heart. All these are metaphorical kinds of zina. 
“The private parts 
    confirm that or deny it” means, zina with the private parts may or may not 
    take place even though a person may have been approaching that. And Allaah 
    knows best. 

    Sharh Muslim, 16/206 

    7 – There are an estimated 8 billion permissive websites, up 
    from approximately half a billion in 1998. So how about now? If you were to 
    give each website a quick glance, how would your heart end up? How much time 
    would you waste in seeking them out? Undoubtedly doing that would destroy 
    one's heart and body, and would be a waste of time. 

    8 – Continually looking at these evil and provocative sites 
    may cause one to become attached to them, so his heart would be filled with 
    forbidden love and become corrupted. Thus he will have exposed himself to 
    fitnah and doom after having been sound and healthy. 

    Ibn al-Jawzi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
A person may be exposed 
    to the causes of love so he falls in love, and he may see a person and this 
    first glance does not create love, but repeatedly looking at that person and 
    mixing with him or her may lead to what was unthinkable. Some people may 
    look at a person and that creates some kind of love, but then they keep away 
    and the love disappears, because continual looking may cause love to grow, 
    like a garden planted with seeds which, if it is neglected, will shrivel and 
    die, but if it is watered it will flourish. 

    Dhamm al-Hawa, p. 237 

    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
The more looks follow 
    one another, the more the heart becomes attached, like water with which a 
    tree is irrigated. If too much water is given the tree is damaged. Similarly 
    if glances are repeated that undoubtedly corrupts the heart. If the heart is 
    exposed to this problem, it will turn away from what it has been commanded 
    and the person will be faced with problems which will inevitably lead him to 
    commit forbidden actions, and his heart will be destroyed. The reason for 
    that is that the one who looks enjoys looking the first time, then he wants 
    to look again, like eating delicious food, when he takes the first bite. But 
    if he had lowered his gaze from the outset, his heart would be at peace. 

    Rawdat al-Muhibbeen, p. 94, 95 

    And he said: 

    Letting one's gaze wander leads to becoming heedless about 
    Allaah and the Hereafter, and will make him intoxicated with love, as Allaah 
    says concerning the lovers of images (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, by your life (O Muhammad), in their 
    wild intoxication, they were wandering blindly”

    [al-Hijr 15:72]

    Looking is like a glass of wine, and love is the intoxication 
    that results from that. The drunkenness of love is worse than the 
    drunkenness caused by wine, for the drunkenness caused by wine will pass, 
    but the drunkenness of love rarely passes until one is in the throes of 
    death. 

    Rawdat al-Muhibbeen, p. 104 
9 – Repeatedly looking 
    at those evil sites may lead a person to commit haraam actions, or to 
    imitate the things he sees. So it starts with looking, and ends with 
    committing haraam deeds. 

    Ibn al-Qayyim said: 

    Looking is the origin of most of the problems that befall 
    man, because looking generates thoughts, then thoughts generate ideas, and 
    ideas generate desires, and desires generate will, which then becomes 
    stronger and becomes firm resolve, in which case the deed will inevitably be 
    done unless there is something to prevent it. Hence it was said that 
    patience in lowering the gaze is easier than patience in bearing the pain 
    that comes afterwards. 

    Al-Jawaab al-Kaafi, p. 106 

    10 – Repeatedly looking at those evil sites causes other 
    kinds of harm too, such as desensitization, and after a while you will never 
    regard that thing as evil and you will get used to looking. This is a sign 
    that the heart has died and lost the shar’i sensitivity towards sin. Another 
    effect is that you expose yourself to suspicion, if someone sees you going 
    to these sites or if others see that on your computer.  

    Finally, 

    What you should keep away from is looking at these sites, 
    even if the purpose is to inform the authorities of them, for the Shayatan 
    may make you go to these sites on this basis and then lead you to worse sins 
    after that. 

    There are technical means available which mean that the 
    Muslims does not need to seek out these sites, and there are specialized 
    committees in some government departments and companies who block these 
    sites. Undoubtedly when a committee in a work place views such things, that 
    is not like a person viewing these sites alone at home, because the person 
    who is doing that alone is more likely to fall into the trap of these sites. 
     

    We are not speaking of something imaginary or something that 
    is impossible or unlikely. We often hear stories of righteous young men who 
    have been tempted by these sites; they start with a glance, then they waste 
    their time with them. 

    You have no need of all that; protect your capital and do not 
    take risks. We ask Allaah to write your reward in full and to make you 
    steadfast in adhering to truth and guidance.

39931,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39931,He has repented from a relationship with a non-mahram woman but he still loves her and feels attached to her,"I am a young man who had a relationship with a girl, but I did not commit any haraam action with her. I know that what I did is not permissible according to sharee’ah, so I ended my contact with her and she accepted that. But I cannot forget her. I love her very much but I cannot marry her, and I often meet her. Is there any means of ridding myself of these feelings and forgetting this girl? I am confused and my confusion may cause me to make a mistake.",,,"Praise be to Allah.We have already explained in the answers to more than one question that it is haraam for a man to have a relationship with a non-mahram woman outside the framework of marriage. See the answer to question no. 23349 and 9465. 
The haraam things that the people who have these relationships fall into include: betrayal, being alone with a non-mahram member of the opposite sex, touching and looking; these are the ways that lead to falling into the sin of zina (fornication, adultery). This is in addition to the harmful effects it has on the heart, causing confusion and distracting it from the purpose for which it was created. 
You say that you still meet this girl, and the results of these meetings are obvious to anyone with common sense. You have to persist in your repentance from your former relationship with her, and cut off all ties with this girl. 
The solution to such a problem is to marry this girl, thus foiling the Shaytaan and protecting yourself from falling into sin. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “We do not think there is anything better for two who love one another than marriage.” Narrated by Ibn Maajah, classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah, 1847. 
What this hadeeth means is that the greatest remedy for treating love is marriage, because this is the only cure for it. See Fayd al-Qadeer by al-Mannaawi, 295. 
But you say that you cannot marry her, so you have no choice other than to be patient, strive to control your nafs (self), and keep yourself busy so that you will not think of her. Your marriage to someone else may be the means of your forgetting her, and you should avoid meeting her as much as you can. 
You should know that the life of this world is very short, and the shortest thing in this life is haraam pleasure and the moments in which a person disobeys his Lord. But the joy of the Hereafter will last forever, so how can a smart person like you sacrifice that eternal joy for a moment of brief pleasure that will blacken the record of his deeds? 
You should know that Allaah may decree death for you when you are alone with her, so how will you meet your Lord in such a state? What will you leave behind of shame and scandal for your family and for hers? 
You should know that Allaah may punish you through your daughter or sister, because you were content to besmirch the honour of another, so you may expect the punishment of Allaah in this world rather than the Hereafter. Allaah protects the family and children of the righteous Muslim by means of his righteousness, but if a man is corrupt the only result can be is that his family and sons and daughters will be corrupt too. How can it be otherwise when he has set them the example by his own actions? 
There is no way to forget about this girl except by filling your heart with the love of Allaah and fear of His punishment, and trying to keep the blessing of Allaah from being diminished because of this sin. Think about the consequences of this action whether in this world or in the Hereafter. Hasten to give up this sin and seek the reward for that with Allaah, so that you will then see – in sha Allaah – the blessings of faith, piety and delight in worship that your Lord will bestow upon you.

39941,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39941,"He swore to divorce her if she visited her family, and now he has recanted. Does he have to offer kafaarat yameen?",My husband swore to divorce me if I visited my family. Now he has recanted. Does he have to offer kafaarat yameen (expiation for breaking a vow)?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
It is prescribed for the Muslim not to use divorce in arguments between him and 
    his wife. That is because of the bad consequences that result from divorce. Many men take the matter of divorce lightly and every time they have 
    an argument with their wives they swear to divorce them, and every time they have a dispute with their friends they swear to divorce their wives, 
    and so on. This is a kind of playing with the word of Allaah, so how about the one who takes divorce as his habit, so that every time he wants to 
    stop his wife doing something or make her do something, he swears to divorce her! 
Al-Nasaa’i (3401) narrated that Mahmoud ibn Labeed said: The Messenger of Allaah 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was told about a man who had divorced his wife three times in one sitting. He stood up angrily 
    and said, “Is he playing with the Book of Allaah whilst I am still among you?” Then a man stood up and said, “O Messenger of Allaah, shall I not 
    kill him?” Al-Haafiz said: the men of its isnaad are trustworthy. This was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Ghaayat al-Maraam, 261. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
Those foolish men who utter words of divorce for every matter, minor or major, are going 
    against the teaching of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) who said: “Whoever swears (an oath), let him swear by Allaah 
    or else remain silent.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2679. So if a believer wants to swear an oath, let him swear by Allaah. 
Moreover we should not make a lot of oaths, because Allaah says (interpretation of 
    the meaning): 
“And protect your oaths (i.e. do not swear much)”
[al-Maa'idah 5:89]
The commentaries on this verse may be summed up as saying that what it means is: 
    do not swear a great deal by Allaah. 
But swearing to divorce one’s wife, such as saying, “My wife is divorced if she 
    does such and such,” or “My wife is divorced if she does not do such and such,” or “if I do such and such then my wife is divorced,” or “If you do 
    not do such and such then my wife is divorced,” and so on, is contrary to the teachings of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him). 
Fataawa al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah, 2/753. 
Secondly: 
As to whether or not divorce takes place as a result of that, the reference point here is the 
    husband’s intention. If he intended to divorce her, then the divorce takes place if his wife does the thing that he swore she should not do. If he 
    did not intend to divorce her, rather he only intended to stop her doing something, then the ruling in this case is the ruling on vows. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: 
The most correct view is that if divorce is used as a vow, in the sense that the 
    intention behind it is to urge someone to do something, or to stop them from doing something, or to prove that someone is telling the truth or 
    lying, or to confirm something, then it comes under the rulings on vows, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O Prophet! Why do you forbid (for yourself) that which Allaah has allowed to 
    you, seeking to please your wives? And Allaah is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful.
Allaah has already ordained for you (O men) the absolution from your oaths”
    [al-Tahreem 66:1-2]
So Allaah has made forbidding something to oneself a vow or oath. 
And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Actions 
    are but by intentions, and every man will have but that which he intended.” Al-Bukhaari, 1.  
This man did not intend to divorce, rather he intended to swear an oath, or 
    something of that nature. So if he breaks his vow, then it is sufficient for him to offer kafaarat yameen. This is the more correct view. 
Fataawa al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah, 2/754 
The Standing Committee was asked about a man who said to his wife, “You will be divorced if 
    you do not come with me,” and she did not go with him. Does this mean that they are divorced? 
They replied: 
If you did not intend that divorce should take place, rather you meant to urge her to go with 
    you, then divorce has not taken place. But you have to offer kafaarat yameen, according to the more sound of the two scholarly opinions. If you 
    did intend that divorce should take place and she did not do as you said, then she has been divorced once.

39947,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39947,She relieved herself in a cup in the Haram,"A woman went to the Haram and entered the area where Zamzam is. She should not control the urge to urinate, so she urinated in a cup and threw it into the water that was flowing from the taps. What is the ruling on that?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
Relieving oneself in the mosque is haraam, so how about if that is in al-Masjid 
    al-Haraam? 
It was narrated that Anas ibn Maalik said: Whilst we were in the mosque with the 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), a Bedouin came and started to urinate in the mosque. The companions of the 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Stop, stop!” The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said, “Do not interrupt him; leave him.” So they left him alone until he had finished urinating, then the Messenger of Allaah 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) called him and said to him: “These mosques are not the place for urinating or for anything 
    filthy, rather they are for the remembrance of Allaah, prayer and reading Qur’aan.” Then he told a man to bring a bucket of water and he threw it 
    over (the urine). 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 217; Muslim 285. 
The Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) felt a sense of pride and 
    protective jealousy (gheerah), so they shouted at that Bedouin and wanted to stop him and denounce him so that he would not carry on 
    urinating. It may be understood from this that it is not permissible to approve of an evil action, rather we must hasten to denounce the one who 
    is doing something wrong, but in this incident denunciation may have led to something even more harmful, and it was for that reason that the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told them not to do it, and he rebuked them for shouting at the Bedouin. 
This is the first issue that should be noted with regard to this question, which is that it is 
    haraam to relieve oneself in the mosque. That applies if a person is going to relieve himself on the floor of the mosque, but if it is going to be 
    in a vessel then some scholars were of the view that it is permissible if that is necessary or if it is too difficult to go out of the mosque 
    because one is sick etc. That appears to be the case in the situation mentioned here. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in al-Fataawa al-Kubra: 
(With regard to) urinating in a vessel in the mosque, some of them forbade that 
    and some allowed it if that is necessary. 
And he said elsewhere that it may be permissible if there is a need for that. He 
    said in al-Fataawa al-Misriyyah: 
It is more likely that it is permissible when necessary. 
Secondly: 
If a person needs to relieve himself then he should conceal himself so that no one 
    will see him and look at his private parts. 
It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas said: The Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) passed by two graves and said: “They are being punished but they are not being punished for anything that was difficult to 
    avoid, but it is a major sin. One of them used not to take care to avoid getting urine on his clothes, and the other used to walk around spreading 
    malicious gossip (nameemah).” Then he took a green date palm leaf, cut it in two and placed one on each grave. They said, “O Messenger of Allaah, 
    why did you do that?” He said, “So that their punishment might be reduced until this dries out.” 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 213 and 5708 – this version was narrated by him; and by 
    Muslim, 292. 
This is the second issue that should be noted with regard to this question, which 
    is that it is essential to conceal one’s ‘awrah when relieving oneself and indeed in all situations. If the sister was keen to do this and did do 
    it, then there is no sin on her, in sha Allaah. 
Thirdly: 
The third issue that should be noted with regard to this question is the disposal 
    of this urine. If she had kept it in a safe container until she took it outside the Haram, or in a place where it could not come into contact with 
    pure (taahir) things, that would have been better. But with what she did – which was to throw it into the place where the water of Zamzam is 
    disposed of – there is the fear that it may have contaminated some of the people who were there at the taps. If the urine was disposed of in such 
    a way that the people would not have been contaminated by it, then there is nothing wrong with this action, but the first action suggested above 
    is more correct, as we have mentioned. 
In conclusion, what this woman did is permissible because she needed to do that, 
    but we should take into consideration the fact that she should conceal herself when relieving herself so that her ‘awrah will not become visible 
    and she will not annoy the people or contaminate them with this najaasah (impurity).

“Thus We have made you [true Muslims — real believers of Islamic Monotheism, true followers of Prophet Muhammad and his Sunnah (legal ways)], a just (and the best) nation, that you be witnesses over mankindand the Messenger (Muhammad) be a witness over you”  [al-Baqarah 2:143]
There are saheeh ahaadeeth from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) which explain this verse and state that what is meant by ummatan wasata is just and best, and what is meant by bearing witness over mankind is bearing witness against the nations on the Day of Resurrection, that their Messengers conveyed the Message to them. The words of the mufassireen do not refer to anything other than that. 
Al-Bukhari (4487) narrated that Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Nooh (peace be upon him) will be called on the Day of Resurrection and it will be said to him: ‘Did you convey (the message)?’ He will say: ‘Yes.’ Then his people will be called and it will be said to them: ‘Did he convey (the message) to you?’ They will say: ‘No warner came to us and no one came to us.’ It will be said to Nooh: ‘Who will bear witness for you?’ He will say: ‘Muhammad and his ummah.’” He said: “That is the words of Allah, ‘Thus We have made you a just (and the best) nation.’” Ahmad (10891) added: He said: “And they will be called and they will bear witness that he conveyed (the message), then I will bear witness for you.” 
Imam Ahmad (1164) and Ibn Maajah (4284) narrated that Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “A Prophet will come on the Day of Resurrection accompanied by one man, and a Prophet will come accompanied by two men, or more than that. Then his people will be called and it will be said to them: ‘Did this one convey the message to you?’ and they will say, ‘No.’ It will be said to him: ‘Did you convey the message to your people?’ and he will say: ‘Yes.’ It will be said to him: ‘Who will bear witness for you?’ He will say: ‘Muhammad and his ummah.’ So Muhammad and his ummah will be called, and it will be said to them: ‘Did this one convey the message to his people?’ They will say: ‘Yes.’ It will be said: ‘How did you know that?’ They will say: ‘Our Prophet came to us and told us that the Messengers had conveyed the message.’ That is the words of Allah, ‘Thus We have made you a just (and the best) nation.’ He said: Just, so that you will be witnesses over mankind and the Messenger will be a witness over you.”
Classed as saheeh by al-Albani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 2448. 
Ibn Jareer al-Tabari said in his commentary on this verse: 
What this means is that just as We have made you a just nation, bearing witness for My Prophets and Messengers against their nations, that they conveyed the message to them that I commanded them to convey, so too My Messenger Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) will be a witness for you, that you believed in him and in what he brought to you from Me.

Jaami’ al-Bayaan, 2/8 
Ibn Katheer said in his commentary on this verse: 
Wasata here refers to the best and most excellent, as it was said: Quraysh awsat al-‘arab nasaban wa daaran, i.e., Quraysh are the best of the Arabs in lineage and abode, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was wasatan fi qawmihi, i.e., the best of his people and noblest in lineage. And al-salaat al-wusta means the best prayer, namely ‘Asr prayer, as is narrated in the books of Saheeh and elsewhere. 
“that you be witnesses over mankind” means: so that you will be witnesses over the nations on the Day of Resurrection, because they will all acknowledge your virtue. End quote. 
Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 1/181 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
What we learn from this verse is the superiority of this ummah over other nations, because Allah says wasatan. 
And we learn that this ummah is just, because Allah says “that you be witnesses over mankind”, and the witness is the one whose word is accepted. 
And we learn that this ummah will bear witness over the nations on the Day of Resurrection, because Allah says “that you be witnesses over mankind.” Testimony may be given in this world and in the Hereafter. When the people are gathered and the Messengers are asked: “Did you convey the message?” they will say, “Yes.” Then the nations will be asked: “Was the message conveyed to you?” and they will say, “No bringer of glad tidings or warner came to us; no one came to us.” Then it will be said to the Messenger, “Who will bear witness for you?” He will say: “Muhammad and his ummah.” So they will be asked to bear witness on the Day of Resurrection and they will bear witness, so they will be witnesses over mankind. 
If someone were to say: How can they bear witness when they did not see? 
We say: But they heard it from one whose words are more authentic than what one sees with one’s own eyes, i.e., the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). End quote. 
Tafseer Soorat al-Baqarah, 2/115, 116 
Al-Baghawi narrated in his Tafseer (1/122) that al-Kalbi said: Wasatan means the followers of the wasat religion, one that represents a middle path between exaggeration and negligence, because both are blameworthy in the matter of religion.  
Shaykh al-Sa’di said in his Tafseer (p. 66): 
i.e., just and best. Allah has made this ummah just in all matters of religion, and in the middle with regard to the Prophets, between those who exaggerated about them like the Christians, and those who shunned them like the Jews, because they believed in all of them in an appropriate manner. 
And they are in the middle with regard to divine laws; they did not go to extremes like the Jews or neglect them like the Christians. 
And with regard to purity and food, unlike the Jews whose prayers are not valid except in their own synagogues and who cannot be cleansed of impurity by water, so good things were forbidden to them as a punishment; and unlike the Christians who do not regard anything as impure or forbidden, rather they permitted everything that exists. Rather the Muslims’ concept of purity and purification is the best and most perfect. Allah permitted to them (the Muslims) all good things with regard to food, drink, clothing and marriage and He forbade to them all that is impure and evil. Hence this ummah has the most complete religion, the noblest attitude and the best of deeds. Allah has bestowed upon them knowledge, forbearance, justice and kindness  such as He did not bestow upon any other nation. Hence they are ummatan wasata, perfect and just, so that they may be “witnesses over mankind” because of their justice and fairness, so they will pass judgement over the people of all other religions, but no one else will pass judgement over them. Whatever this ummah testifies is worthy of acceptance will be accepted, and whatever they testify is worthy of rejection will be rejected. 
If it is said: How can their ruling against others be accepted, because when there are two disputing parties, the word of one against the other cannot be accepted? 
The answer is that the word of one of the disputants cannot be accepted, if there is some doubt about his character. But if there is no doubt and there is certainty of justice and good character, as in the case of this ummah, then the aim is to rule with justice and truth. The condition of that is knowledge and fairness, which both exist in this ummah so its word will be accepted. End quote.",Islam Q&A
39991,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39991,Whoever breaks the fast when making up a missed Ramadaan fast only has to make up one day,"A woman was making up one of the days that she did not fast in Ramadaan because of menstruation, then her period came on that day when she was making up the fast. Does she have to make up one day or two?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.She only has to make up the day that she did not fast in Ramadaan, because the day she was fasting when her period came was only to replace the day that she did not fast in Ramadaan; it was not a new obligatory fast. 
Ibn Hazm said in al-Muhalla (6/271): Whoever deliberately breaks a fast observed to make up for a missed Ramadaan fast only has to make up one day, because the obligation to make up the fast applies only to the Ramadaan fast. It was narrated in a saheeh report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) made up that day he missed of Ramadaan. So it is not permissible to add more to it without any shar’i text to support that and without any scholarly consensus. It was narrated from one of the salaf that he has to make up two days, the day from Ramadaan and the day when he was making up that fast. 
It says in al-Taaj wa’l-Ikleel: Whoever breaks a fast observed to make up for a missed day from Ramadaan only has to make up one day. 3/387.
