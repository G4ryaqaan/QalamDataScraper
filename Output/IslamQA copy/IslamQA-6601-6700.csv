6620,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6620,Should he change his wife’s name Sahira?,"I got married recently . My wife's name is ""SAHIRA"".
1. What does ""Sahira"" mean in Quranic Arabic?;
2. If it has a bad meaning then should I change it?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Sihr (magic, witchcraft) is a word used to describe spells, incantations and knots [used for purposes of witchcraft] which have an effect on people’s hearts and bodies, so that may cause sickness, kill or cause division between a man and his wife. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And from these (angels) people learn that by which they cause separation between man and his wife”
[al-Baqarah 2:102]
Sihr is a devilish action, most of which is only achieved by means of shirk and drawing close to the shayaateen (devils) by means of that which they love. 
The saahir (practitioner of witchcraft) is the one who does this action. The word Saahirah describes a woman who does that. 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And from the evil of those who practise witchcraft when they blow in the knots”
[al-Falaq 113:4]
This is a references to female witches (sawaahir pl. of saahirah). 
Sihr is a major sin. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and the magician will never be successful, to whatever amount (of skill) he may attain”
[Ta-Ha 20:69]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Avoid the seven sins which doom a person to Hell” – among which he mentioned sihr (witchcraft). 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2767; Muslim, 89. 
The word sihr is sometimes used to refer to permissible things such as eloquence and the ability to express oneself in a clear and moving manner, which stirs people’s hearts, as in the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Some eloquent speech is as effective as magic.” 
Whatever the case, it is preferable to change this name, but you must avoid names which may have false meanings or which may cause confusion or lead to the person being accused. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to change ugly names to good names. 
See question no. 14622, Is it obligatory to change a name if it is not good? 
It was narrated from Ibn ‘Umar that ‘Umar had a daughter whose name was ‘Aasiyah (meaning disobedient). The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) named her Jameelah instead. Narrated by Muslim, 2139. 
Names carry meanings, as it is said, and everyone is influenced by his name. So we are required to choose good names that have meanings.

6622,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6622,The meaning of enslavement in Islam,"Can you please clarify the subject of Slaves in Islam. In The Koran, there are many mentions of this term in particular the instance where man is the slave to his Master Allah, which I fully understand and agree. But in many instances the Koran cites where one man/woman is the slave of another man/woman. In what context has Allah made this permissible, if it is permissible. Your clarification on this subject would be most grateful.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The enslavement of the Muslim to Allaah, may He be glorified, is what He had commanded in His Book and is the Message with which He sent the Messengers, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (community, nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): “Worship Allaah (Alone), and avoid (or keep away from) Taaghoot (all false deities, i.e. do not worship Taaghoot besides Allaah)” [al-Nahl 16:36].
The word ‘Uboodiyyah (enslavement) in Arabic comes from the word Ta’beed (enthrallment, subjugation). The phrase ‘abbadtu’l-tareeq means “I made the way smooth and easy to walk on.” The enslavement of the slave to Allaah has two meanings, one general and one specific. If by “slave” I mean al-mu’abbad, i.e., one who is subjugated, this is the general meaning which includes every created thing in the both the higher and the lower realms, sentient and otherwise, animate and inanimate, moving and stationary, kaafir and mu’min, righteous and immoral, for every creature is subjugated by Allaah and is subject to His control, and for each of them there is a limit at which it stops.
If by “slave” I mean al-‘aabid, one who worships Allaah and obeys His commands, this meaning applies specifically to the believers to the exclusion of the kaafireen, because the believers are the true slaves of Allaah who attribute Lordship and Divinity to Him Alone and recognize Him by His Names and Attributes, and do not associate anything with Him. As Allaah says in the story of Iblees (interpretation of the meaning):
“[Iblees (Satan)] said: ‘O my Lord! Because You misled me, I shall indeed adorn the path of error for them (mankind) on the earth, and I shall mislead them all. Except Your chosen, (guided) slaves among them.’ (Allaah) said: ‘This is the Way which will lead straight to Me. Certainly, you shall have no authority over My slaves, except those who follow you of the Ghaawoon (Mushrikoon and those who go astray, criminals, polytheists, and evildoers).’” [al-Hijr 15:39-42]
With regard to the ‘ibaadah (worship) which Allaah enjoins upon us, this is a word which includes everything that Allaah loves and is pleased with of words and deeds, both open and hidden, and excludes anything that may cancel that out. This definition includes the Shahaadatayn, Salaah, Hajj, fasting, jihaad for the sake of Allaah, enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, and believing in Allaah, the angels, the Messengers and the Last Day. The basis for this worship is purity of intention, so that the aim of the worshipper is to seek the Face of Allaah, may He be glorified, and the Home of the Hereafter. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And Al-Muttaqûn (the pious) will be far removed from it (Hell). He who spends his wealth for increase in self-purification, And who has (in mind) no favour from anyone to be paid back, Except to seek the Countenance of his Lord, the Most High. He surely, will be pleased (when he will enter Paradise).” [al-Layl 92:17-21]
So purity of intention is essential, as is sincerity, so that the believer strives to follow what Allaah has commanded and to avoid what He has forbidden, prepares himself for the Meeting with Allaah (may He be exalted), gives up feeling helpless and lazy, and refrains from following his own desires, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“O you who believe! Be afraid of Allaah, and be with those who are true (in words and deeds).” [al-Tawbah 9:119]
It is also essential to follow the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), so the worshipper should worship Allaah in accordance with what He has prescribed and not in accordance with what created beings desire or innovate. This is the aim of following the Prophet who was sent from Allaah, Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Purity of intention, sincerity and following the Messenger are all essential. Once these matters are understood, then it will be clear to us that everything that goes against these essentials is in fact enslavement to people. So showing off is a form of enslavement to people; Shirk is a form of enslavement to people; neglecting Allaah’s commands and angering the Lord in order to earn people’s approval is a form of enslavement to people. Everyone who puts following his own desires before obeying his Lord has gone beyond the bounds of ‘Uboodiyyah (enslavement to Allaah) and has deviated from the Straight Path. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Doomed is the slave of the dinar, doomed is the slave of the dirham, doomed is the slave of fine cloth and doomed is the slave of velvet. If he is given something he is pleased and if he is denied, he is angry. Doomed is he! If he is pierced by a thorn, may he never be able to remove it.”
Enslavement to Allaah includes and implies love, fear and hope. The slave loves his Lord, fears His punishment and hopes for His Mercy and reward. These are the three essential pillars of ‘Uboodiyyah or enslavement.
Enslavement to Allaah is an honour, not a cause of humiliation, as the poet said:
“What increases me in honour and pride, so that my feet nearly stepped on the Pleiades, is that I am included in Your words ‘O My slaves,’ and that You made Ahmad my Prophet.”
We ask Allaah to make us among His righteous slaves. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
6648,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6648,How      can his deceased relatives benefit from his reading Quran?,"When I read the Holy Quran I would like my relatives who passed away to benefit from my reading .Besides,I want to make supplications after reading the Quran for myself and my family.What actions are exactly to be done ,for as far as I know raising hands and wiping the face are bid'ah?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The correct view is that the dead can benefit from the physical acts of worship undertaken by their living relatives with the intention of giving the reward to them (such as fasting and other than that). The same applies to financial acts of worship, such as giving charity on behalf of the deceased or freeing a slave on his behalf, even though some of these actions are not prescribed as such.
 This is indicated by the hadeeth of Sa’d ibn ‘Ubaadah (may Allah be pleased with him), who gave his garden in charity on behalf of his mother who had died, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) approved of that (narrated by al-Bukhaari), and other ahaadeeth.
 But giving charity on behalf of the deceased is better than reading Quran for them, just as making du’aa’ for them and seeking forgiveness for them is better than other deeds.
 If you give in charity on behalf of your deceased relative, or you make du’aa’ for him – or other actions – the deceased will benefit from that, and you will also have the reward for that, for the Bounty of Allah is immense.
 With regard to raising one's hands when making du’aa’: this is not bid’ah; in fact it is Sunnah and is part of the teachings of guidance and one of the means of having one’s du’aa’s answered. It was narrated in a saheeh report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah is modest and most generous; if a man raises his hands to Him, He cannot send them back empty and unanswered,” (Narrated by Ahmad and Abu Dawood from the hadeeth of Salmaan).
 But it is makrooh to raise one’s hands at certain times, such as when the khateeb makes du’aa’ at Jumu’ah prayers, unless the khateeb is praying for rain at Jumu’ah prayers, in which case it is prescribed to raise one's hands. This was reported in a saheeh hadeeth from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).
 Similarly, it is not permitted to raise one's hands in congregation or individually after praying a fard prayer, as there is no evidence for doing so. Wiping the face, chest or body after making du’aa’ is bid’ah and is not permitted. And Allah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
6652,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6652,What Is the Meaning of “Allah Is Beautiful and Loves Beauty”?,"What is the meaning of the hadith which says that Allah is beautiful and loves beauty? What is meant here by beauty, especially since some people use this hadith as evidence that it is permissible to look at beautiful women and to enjoy every beautiful thing? Can you clarify this?","Allah loves to see the external beauty of His slaves which reflects His blessings on them, and the inner beauty of their gratitude to Him for those blessings. Just as Allah loves beauty in words, deeds, garments and outward appearance, He hates ugliness in words, deeds, garments and outward appearance.","Meaning of Allah Is Beautiful and Loves Beauty


Types of beauty in clothing and outward appearance","Praise be to Allah.Meaning of Allah Is Beautiful and Loves Beauty
The hadith mentioned in the question was narrated by Muslim in his Sahih, no. 131, from ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ud, who narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No one will enter Paradise who has an atom’s-weight of pride in his heart.” A man said, “What if a man likes his clothes to look good and his shoes to look good?” He said, “Allah is beautiful and loves beauty. Pride means denying the truth and looking down on people.”
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said, commenting on this hadith:
“The phrase “Allah is beautiful and loves beauty” includes the beautiful clothing which was asked about in the same hadith. It is included by way of generalization, i.e., that beauty in all things is what is meant here. In Sahih Muslim no. 1686, it says: “Allah is good and only accepts that which is good.” In Sunan al-Tirmidhi it says: “Allah loves to see the effects of His blessing on His slave.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, no. 2963; he said it is hasan sahih)
It was reported that Abu’l-Ahwas al-Jashami said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw me wearing old, tattered clothes, and asked me, “Do you have any wealth?” I said, “Yes.” He said, “What kind of wealth?” I said, “All that Allah has given me of camels and sheep.” He said, “Then show the generous blessings that He has given you.” (Narrated by Ahmad, no. 15323; al-Tirmidhi, 1929; al-Nasai, 5128) 
Allah, may He be glorified, loves the effects of His blessings to His slave to be made manifest, for this is part of the beauty that He loves, and that is part of the gratitude for His blessings which forms an inner beauty (beauty of character). Allah loves to see the external beauty of His slaves which reflects His blessings on them, and the inner beauty of their gratitude to Him for those blessings . Because He loves beauty, He sends down on His slaves clothes and adornments with which they may make their outward appearance beautiful and He gives them Taqwa which makes their inner characters beautiful. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“O Children of Adam! We have bestowed raiment upon you to cover yourselves (screen your private parts, etc.) and as an adornment, and the raiment of righteousness, that is better.” [al-A’raf 7:26]
And He says, speaking of the people of Paradise (interpretation of the meaning):
“… and [Allah] gave them Nadratan (a light of beauty) and joy. And their recompense shall be Paradise and silken garments, because they were patient.” [al-Insan 76:11-12]
Their faces will be made beautiful with the Nadrah (light of beauty), their innermost being with joy and their bodies with silken garments.
Just as Allah loves beauty in words, deeds, garments and outward appearance, He hates ugliness in words, deeds, garments and outward appearance . He hates ugliness and its people, and loves beauty and its people. But two groups are misguided with regard to this issue: a group who say that everything that He has created is beautiful, so He loves all that He has created and we should love all that He has created and not hate anything. They say: whoever realizes that all that exists comes from Him will see that it is beautiful… These people have no sense of jealousy for the sake of Allah or hatred and enmity for the sake of Allah, or denouncing what is evil (munkar), or jihad for the sake of Allah, or adhering His limits. They regard the beauty of images, male or female, as being part of the beauty that Allah loves, and seek to worship Allah through immoral acts. Some of them may even go so far as to claim that the One Whom they worship is manifested or incarnated in those images.
The second group, on the other hand, say that Allah condemns the beauty of images, forms and outward appearances. Allah says about the Munafiqun (hypocrites) (interpretation of the meaning):
“And when you look at them, their bodies please you…” [al-Munafiqun 63:4]
“And how many a generation have We destroyed before them. Who were better in wealth, goods and outward appearance?” [Maryam 19:54]
In Sahih Muslim, it is reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah does not look at your outward appearance and your wealth, rather He looks at your hearts and deeds.” (Sahih Muslim, no. 4651)
According to another hadith: “Shabbiness is part of faith.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah, 4108; Abu Dawud, 3630; classed as sahih by al-Albani, may Allah have mercy on him). 
Allah condemns those who are extravagant, which applies to extravagance in clothing as well as in food and drink.
Types of beauty in clothing and outward appearance
In order to settle this dispute, we may say that beauty in clothing and outward appearance is of three types, one of which is commendable, one is blameworthy and one of which is neither. 

The kind of beauty which is to be commended is that which is done for the sake of Allah, to help one to obey Allah and fulfill His commands, such as when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) made himself look beautiful (i.e. handsome) when meeting the delegations that came to him. This is like wearing armour or battle-dress when fighting, or wearing silk and showing off (in front of the enemy). This is commendable because it is done to make the word of Allah supreme and to support His religion and annoy His enemies.
The blameworthy kind of beauty is that which is done for the sake of this world, for reasons of power, false pride and showing off, or to fulfill some (selfish) desires. This also includes cases where beauty is an end in itself for a person and is all he cares about. Many people have no other concern in life. 
As for the kind of beauty which is neither commendable nor blameworthy, it is that which has nothing to do with either of the two purposes mentioned above (i.e., it is neither for the sake of Allah nor for the sake of worldly purposes).

The hadith under discussion refers to two important principles, knowledge and behaviour. Allah is to be acknowledged for beauty that bears no resemblance to anything else, and He is to be worshipped by means of the beauty which He loves in words, deeds and attitudes. He loves His slaves to beautify their tongues with the truth, to beautify their hearts with sincere devotion (Ikhlas), love, repentance and trust in Him, to beautify their faculties with obedience, and to beautify their bodies by showing His blessings upon them in their clothing and by keeping them pure and free of any filth, dirt or impurity, by removing the hairs which should be removed, by circumcision, and by clipping the nails. Thus they recognize Allah through these qualities of beauty and seek to draw close to Him through beautiful words, deeds and attitudes. They acknowledge Him for the beauty which is His attribute and they worship Him through the beauty which He has prescribed and His religion. The hadith combines these two principles of knowledge and behaviour.” (Al-Fawaid, 1/185)
Where are these deep meanings of this hadith, as explained by Ibn al-Qayyim, in the misguided interpretations of those who follow their whims and desires, who want to follow deviant interpretations in order to justify their evil aims and goals? We ask Allah to protect us. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
6653,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6653,Jumu’ah Sunnah Prayer,"When I go to the mosque on Friday the adhan is pronounced, then everyone prays 2 or 4 rak’ahs. Then the adhan is again pronounced and immediately after it iqamah. Having prayed 2 Jum'ah rak’ahs, people pray again 2 or 4 rak’ahs. Besides, the imam when supplicating raises hands then wipes his face and everyone follows him. Is it bid'ah?","There is no sunnah prayer before Jumu’ah prayer. When the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) prayed Jumu’ah, he would enter his house and pray two Rak’ahs of Sunnah, and he commanded those who had prayed it to pray four rak’ahs afterwards.","Sunnah prayer before Jumu’ah


Du`a behind the imam after Jumu’ah prayer


Wiping the face after du`a","Praise be to Allah.Sunnah prayer before Jumu’ah
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to come out of his house on the day of Jumu’ah (Friday) and climb up on his minbar. Then the muadhdhin would give the Adhan, and when he finished, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would start his khutbah.
If there were any Sunnah prayer to be done before Jumu’ah , he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would have told them about it and directed them to do it after the Adhan, and he would have done it himself.
At the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), there was nothing apart from the Adhan just before the khutbah.
Hence the majority of the imams agreed that there is no sunnah to be done at a specific time before Jumu’ah with a specific number of rak’ahs, because that would have been reported from the words or actions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and nothing of that nature has been reported from him. This is the madhhab of Malik, al-Shaf’i and most of his companions, and is the well known view in the madhhab of Ahmad.
Al-Iraqi said:
“I have not seen anything to indicate that the three imams recommended praying Sunnah before it [Jumu’ah].”
Al-Albani commented:
“For that reason this so-called Sunnah is not mentioned in Kitab al-Umm by Imam al-Shafi’i, or in al-Masail by Imam Ahmad, or by any of the other early imams, as far as I know.
Hence I say:
Those who pray this Sunnah are not following the Messenger or imitating any of the imams; on the contrary, they are imitating the later scholars who are like them in that they are also imitators [of earlier scholars] rather than mujtahidin [scholars who investigate and form their own rulings]. I am amazed to see an imitator imitating another imitator.” (Al-Qawl al-Mubin, 60, 374)
Moreover, between the first call of Jumu’ah prayer and the second call, there should be sufficient time for people to get ready to pray, not just the time it takes to pray two rak’ahs or thereabouts, as is done in some countries and some mosques.
Du`a behind the imam after Jumu’ah prayer
With regard to making du’a together in one voice behind the imam after the prayer, Shaykh Ibn Uthaymin answered this question in al-Fatawa, p. 368, where he said:
“This is one of the bid’ahs which was not reported from the Prophet or from his Companions. What is prescribed in Islam is for people to remember Allah Alone after the prayer, in accordance with the teachings of the Messenger of Allah, and this should be done aloud, as reported in Sahih al-Bukhari from Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both), who said: People used to raise their voices in Dhikr [remembrance of Allah] after finishing the prescribed prayer at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).”
Sunnah prayer after Jumu’ah
With regard to the prayer after Jumu’ah, Ibn al-Qayyim said in al-Zad (1/440):
When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had prayed Jumu’ah, he would enter his house and pray two Rak’ahs of Sunnah, and he commanded those who had prayed it to pray four rak’ahs afterwards. 
Our Shaykh, Abul-’Abbas Ibn Taymiyah said: if he prayed in the mosque, he would pray four, and if he prayed at home, he would pray two. I say: this is what is indicated by many ahadith. Abu Dawud reported in his Sunan (1130) from Ibn ‘Umar that when he prayed in the mosque, he prayed four and when he prayed at home, he prayed two.
Wiping the face after du`a
With regard to wiping the face after making du’a , this is not reported in any sahih hadith; indeed, some of the scholars stated that it is bid’ah. (Mu’jam al-Bida’, p. 227)
Do not do that which is bid’ah and do not take part in it; advise and enjoin people to follow the Sunnah; remind them and tell them about the Islamic ruling.

If the situation you describe, the occasional emission of a few drops of urine, is beyond your control, then your case is like that of one who is incontinent , so do the following:

Wash the private parts with water.
Wash the part of your clothes that the urine has gotten onto (there is no need to change your clothes).
Put a pad or a piece of cotton, or something similar, over the private parts so that the urine will not spread.

  nothing to that effect has been narrated from the Prophet

  the beard should be left as it is.
Muslim (2344) reported that Jaabir ibn Samurah (may Allaah

  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to have a very hairy beard.”
An-Nisaa’ (5232) reported from al-Baraa’ that he

  a thick beard; according to another report, he had a bushy beard; according 
  to another report, he had a wide beard.
Some scholars permit cutting the hair of the beard that exceeds 
  the amount that may be grasped in the fist, because Ibn ‘Umar did this; 
  but most of the scholars regard this as makrooh, which is more apparent because 
  of the reports referred to above.
Al-Nawawi said: the best is to leave it as it is and not touch 
  it or shorten it at all. (Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi, 8/39).
- As for the hadeeth, “He used to reduce the length and 
  width (of his beard)” – this is a false and fabricated hadeeth.

Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Indeed in the Messenger of Allaah (Muhammad) you have 
  a good example to follow for him who hopes for (the Meeting with) Allaah and 
  the Last Day…” [al-Ahzaab 33:21]
“And whatsoever the Messenger (Muhammad) gives you, take 
  it; and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it).” [al-Hashr 59:7]
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah preserve him) said: 
  The definition of the beard as stated by the scholars of (Arabic) language is: 
  the hair of the face, jawbone and cheeks, in the sense that all the hair on 
  the cheeks, jawbone and chin is part of the beard and removing any of it is 
  counted as a sin, because the Messenger  (peace 
  and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Let your beards grow,” 
  “Leave your beards alone,” “Let your beards increase,” “Let 
  your beards be full.” This indicates that it is not permissible to remove 
  anything from the beard. But the sin may vary in degree – shaving the beard 
  is worse than shortening it, because it is a more obvious contradiction of the 
  Sunnah.

How to deal with the question: Who created Allah?


Prior existence of Allah","Praise be to Allah.Origin of the Question: Who Created Allah?
This question which the non-Muslims have asked you is inherently false and self-contradictory. If we were to say – for the sake of argument – that someone created Allah, then they would ask you, Who created the creator of the Creator? Then, who created the creator of the creator of the creator?! And so on, ad infinitum. This is irrational and impossible.
All of creation goes back to the Creator Who created all things. No one created Him; He created everything other than Himself. This is what makes sense and is logical. This Creator is Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.
With regard to what our religion tells us, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told us about this question, where it comes from, and how to respond to it.
Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “People will keep on asking questions until someone will say, ‘Allah created the universe , but who created Allah?’ Whoever encounters anything like that, let him say, ‘Amantu Billah (I believe in Allah).’”
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The Shaytan will come to one of you and say, ‘Who created heaven? Who created the earth?’ He will say, ‘Allah’” – then he mentioned something similar (to the previous report), and added, “And His Messengers.” [i.e., amantu Billah wa Rusulihi = I believe in Allah and His Messengers]
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The Shaytan will come to one of you and say, ‘Who created such and such?’ until he says to him, ‘Who created your Lord ?’ When it reaches that stage, let him seek refuge with Allah [say A’udhu Billahi min ash-shaytan ir-rajim = I seek refuge with Allah from the accursed Shaytan] and stop thinking about it.”
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The Shaytan will come to a person and say, ‘Who created such and such…’” and he narrated the whole report. (Imam Muslim, 134)

to stop pursuing these thoughts and these tricks of the Shaytan
to say, “I believe in Allah and His Messengers”
to seek refuge with Allah from the Shaytan.

It was also reported that one should spit dryly three times to one’s left, and recite Qul Huwa Allahu ahad. (See ""Problems and Solutions"")
Prior existence of Allah
With regard to the prior existence of Allah , our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has told us about this, for example:
He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “O Allah, You are the First and there is nothing before You; O Allah, You are the Last and there is nothing after You.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2713)
He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah existed when there was nothing apart from Him.” According to another report, “There was nothing before Him.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari; the first report 3020; the second report 6982).
This is in addition to what is stated in the verses of the Quran. The believer believes without doubt, the non-Muslim denies and the hypocrite doubts. We ask Allah to grant us sincere and certain faith with no doubts. And Allah is the Source of strength.

6666,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6666,Should    she continue working in place where she mixes with men?,"I am a muslim woman raised with basic Islamic teachings but overall in a more Western way - educated abroad in a European university, and worked thereafter in a large multinational following what is traditionally known as the ""career path"". This way of life has been encouraged by the parents and the lifestyle under which I have been raised. Furtheremore as my parents are no longer working I have become the financial support for the family. I am currently living alone at 31 years in a Western country where there are no Arabs or Mulsims around. And due to my Islamic upbriging find myself islolated from my surroundings as I have no interest in going to parties, bars, dating etc....
My choices are 2. To return home under the parents umbrella and settle for any work to keep me busy and if lucky find a husband. This will however mean sacrificing income at least for the short term which will be difficult for the family as well as sacrificing a very good position at the company I am in. Or alternately continue in this career path hoping that someday I will meet a good muslim man who can help me live a more mulsim way of life.
What is the isalmic point of view in such instances.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The choice facing our sister is a choice between what is right and what is wrong, between what is halal and what is haram.
Hence we can only advise our sister to protect the best thing that she possesses, which is her religion and chastity, and to stay with her family so as to protect herself and be among those who will protect her. Perhaps Allah will make it easy for her to find work that is acceptable according to sharee’ah, and a righteous husband. We give her the glad tidings of the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Whoever gives up something for the sake of Allah, Allah will compensate him with something better than that.”
(Classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani – may Allah have mercy on him – in Hijaab al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah).
How many brothers and sisters have left their work– even when they were earning lots of money – leaving for the sake of Allah after learning that the environment they were in went against Islamic rulings, then Allah opened many ways for them and gave them a bountiful provision, and guided their hearts to something better than they had been following before.
We also want to remind our sister about her parents, and tell her that staying with them and taking care of them is much better than being apart from them. She should not pay attention to their wishes that she should do work that is not acceptable according to sharee’ah. Many people are keen for worldly things, and they do not pay attention to the forbidden and objectionable things that may surround the work their daughters and sons do.
Striving for the purpose of this transient world at the expense of one’s religion is not something that we accept for our sisters or daughters, or for the sister who is asking this question.
You should not pay any attention to the fact that this is an international company or that the salary is tempting. That does not mean anything if it also brings the wrath of Allah. It is bad enough that you are with non-mahram men at work, let alone that you are in a country where there are no Muslims. Moreover, you may have to travel without a mahram to the kuffaar countries and stay among them. You may be living in a house on your own, which poses a danger to your religious commitment, your person and your honour, as is quite obvious. The Islamic texts indicate that it is haram for women to mix with men, to travel without a mahram and to settle among the kuffaar.
Your idea of isolating yourself of which you speak may not last for long, because of the many temptations and the lack of help and support. The path of evil starts with one step, and if a person follows it, it may be difficult for him to think of himself and his Hereafter. By the Grace of Allah towards you, you are seeking advice and knowledge of the Islamic rulings, so do not feel any regrets about this world. Simple things are sufficient for the one who is content with what Allah gives him; it is greed that destroys taqwa and robs people of their common sense.
There is nothing to stop you from looking for work that is acceptable according to sharee’ah, especially since some companies now employ people at home, letting them do their work via the Internet. This may be a suitable alternative, especially for Muslim women.
We ask Allah to guide you to that which will be beneficial for you, and to protect your religious commitment, for He is the One Who is the Guardian of that and is Able to do that. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.

6670,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6670,Ruling on greeting    with a gesture,What is the ruling in Islaam on greeting by means of gesture with the hands. One usually does this if the person is afar. Is this permissible or does it have no basis?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Al-Tirmidhi narrated in al-Sunan (5/56) from ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “He is not one of us who imitates others. Do not imitate the Jews or the Christians, for the greeting of the Jews is a gesture with the fingers and the greeting of the Christians is a gesture with the hand.” Al-Albani said: (it is) hasan.
The words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) “he is not one of us” means he is not one of those who follow the same path as us and pay attention to doing things our way. “Who imitates others” means, he imitates those who are not of our religion. The meaning is: do not imitate them at all in any of their deeds, especially in these two characteristics. They would only give or return a greeting by means of a gesture, without speaking the words of salam (peace), which is the way of Adam and his descendents among the Prophets and awliyaa’ (close friends of Allah). Al-Nasaa’i reported with a jayyid isnaad from Jaabir, attributing it to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “do not give the greeting of the Jews, for they greet by means of a gesture of the head and hand.” Note: al-Nawawi said: this (the hadeeth of Jaabir) does not contradict the hadeeth of Asmaa’ bint Yazeed: the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) passed through the mosque where a group of women were sitting, and he greeted them with a wave of his hand. This hadeeth is to be interpreted as meaning that he greeted them with both a gesture and the words of greeting. Abu Dawood also reported this hadeeth from her, saying, “and he greeted us.” The prohibition on greeting with a gesture only is limited to those who are able – both physically and within the limits of sharee’ah – to speak the words of greeting. Otherwise it is permissible for the one who is doing something that prevents him from speaking to respond to a greeting with a gesture – such as when one is praying, or when one is far away; it is also permissible to use gestures if one is unable to speak (“dumb”), or when greeting the deaf.
Greeting with a gesture and without speaking is an imitation of the Jews or Christians. The same applies to many military salutes. The scholars have stated that it is bid’ah to greet with a gesture and without saying the words of greeting (i.e., “al-salamu ‘alaykum”). See: al-Lama’ by al-Turkmaani, 1/285, 282.

Whoever does not regard the Mushrikeen as kaafirs or doubts that they are kaafirs or regard their way as correct, is a kaafir according to scholarly consensus.
After enumerating them, he said (may Allaah have mercy on him):
In the case of all these things that nullify Islam, there is no difference whether a person is joking or is serious or is afraid except in cases where he is forced to do something. All of them are among the things that are very dangerous and which happen very often. The Muslim has to beware of them and fear them happening to him.

Shirk and kufr are the same when it comes to the ruling (hukm)


Ibn Hazm said:
Kufra and shirk are the same; every kaafir is a mushrik and every mushrik is a kaafir. This is the view of al-Shaafa and others.
(al-Fisl, 3/124).
The Jews and Christians are kuffaar and mushrikeen. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
And the Jews say: Uzair (Ezra) is the son of Allaah, and the Christians say: Messiah is the son of Allaah. That is their saying with their mouths, resembling the saying of those who disbelieved aforetime. Allaahs Curse be on them, how they are deluded away from the truth! They (Jews and Christians) took their rabbis and their monks to be their lords besides Allaah (by obeying them in things which they made lawful or unlawful according to their own desires without being ordered by Allaah), and (they also took as their Lord) Messiah, son of Maryam (Mary), while they (Jews and Christians) were commanded [in the Tauraat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] to worship none but One Ilaah (God Allaah) Laa ilaaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He). Praise and glory be to Him (far above is He) from having the partners they associate (with Him). [al-Tawbah 9:30-31].
It was reported from Abu Hurayrag that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: By the One is Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, not one of this nation, Jew or Christian, will hear of me and will die without having believed in that with which I have been sent, but he will be one of the dwellers of Hell fire.
(Narrated by Muslim, 153)
Whoever says that the Jews are not kaafirs is disbelieving in the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meanings):
And their hearts absorbed (the worship of) the calf because of their disbelief [al-Baqarah 2:93]
Among those who are Jews, there are some who displace words from (their) right places and say: We hear your word (O Muhammad) and disobey, and Hear and let you (O Muhammad) hear nothing. And Raaina [in Arabic it means Be careful, listen to us, and we listen to you, whereas in Hebrew, it means an insult] with a twist of their tongues and as a mockery of the religion (Islâm). And if only they had said: We hear and obey, and Do make us understand, it would have been better for them, and more proper; but Allaah has cursed them for their disbelief [al-Nisa 4:46]
Because of their breaking the covenant, and of their rejecting the Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allaah, and of their killing the Prophets unjustly, and of their saying: Our hearts are wrapped (with coverings, i.e. we do not understand what the Messengers say) nay, Allaah has set a seal upon their hearts because of their disbelief, so they believe not but a little. And because of their (Jews) disbelief and uttering against Maryam (Mary) a grave false charge (that she has committed illegal sexual intercourse);  And because of their saying (in boast), We killed Messiah Eesaa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), the Messenger of Allaah, but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but it appeared so to them the resemblance of Eesaa (Jesus) was put over another man (and they killed that man)] [al-Nisa 4:155-157]

And We have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating torment [al-Nisa 4:150-151]
Whoever says that the Christians are not kuffaar is disbelieving in the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meanings):
Surely, in disbelief are they who say that Allaah is the Messiah, son of Maryam (Mary) [al-Maaidah 5:17]
Surely, disbelievers are those who said: Allaah is the third of the three (in a Trinity). But there is no Ilaah (god) (none who has the right to be worshipped) but One Ilaah (God Allâh). And if they cease not from what they say, verily, a painful torment will befall on the disbelievers among them [al-Maaidah 5:73]

Some of these conditions are agreed upon, and others are disputed. The conditions that are agreed upon are:  
1.Islam
Ibn Quddamah said: The kaafir cannot be the wali of a Muslim woman, according to the consensus of the scholars.
A similar view was also narrated from Ibn al-Mundhir. (al-Mughni, 7/356) 
2.Being of sound mind. 
3.Majority (having reached puberty)  
4.Being male.
Ibn Rushd said: (The scholars) agreed that among the conditions of guardianship are: being Muslim, being an adult and being male.
Bidaayat al-Mujtahid, 2/12
Ibn Qudaamah said: Being male is a condition of guardianship according to all (the scholars). (al-Mughni, 7/356) 
The conditions concerning which the scholars disputed are:  
1.Being free
The condition of being free is listed by most of the scholars; the Hanafis were of a different view.
The basis of describing freedom as a condition is that a slave has no power of guardianship over himself, so it is more likely that he cannot have the power of guardianship over anyone else.
(See the two references mentioned above)   
2.Being of good character
Imaam al-Shaafa'i and Imaam Ahmad were of the view that this is one of the conditions of guardianship.
What is meant by good character is appearing to be of good character. It is not necessary for the wali to be of good character both outwardly and inwardly. Such a requirement would be too difficult and would lead to most marriages being invalid. (Khashshaaf al-Qinaa’, 3/30)  
It is important to note that the questioner may want to marry the woman, then if he discusses some issues with her guardian and they have an argument, he might accuse him of not believing in referring to the Qur’aan and Sunnah. This would be overstepping the mark and a major sin, because it is accusing a Muslim of something that would put him beyond the pale of Islam. 
But if the wife’s guardian really does not believe in the Sunnah, like that group which calls itself al-Qur’aaniyyeen, then he should argue with him, explain the truth to him, dispel his confusion and establish proof against him. Then if he persists he is a kaafir, and it is not permissible for him to be the guardian of a Muslim woman for marriage even if she is his daughter. He forfeits the right of guardianship, which then passes to the closest Muslim relative of the woman. And Allah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

Can men wear chains?","Praise be to Allah.Can men wear rings made from silver?
With regard to men wearing rings of silver , this is permissible and there is nothing wrong with it.
Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wanted to send a letter to the Romans, he was told that they would not read any letter unless it had a seal on it, so he took a ring of silver. It is as if I can see it shining on his hand, and engraved on t were the words ‘Muhammad the Messenger of Allah.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5537; Muslim 2092)
A similar report was also narrated by Ibn ‘Umar (al-Bukhari, 5528; Muslim, 2091).
Shaykh al-Islam (Ibn Taymiyah) was asked about men wearing silver, and he said:
“As for rings of silver , this is permissible according to the consensus of the imams. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had a ring of silver and his Companions wore rings . This is unlike gold rings , which are forbidden according to the consensus of the four imams. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade that. 
As for wearing silver, there is no general statement that it is forbidden, and no one has the right to say that it is forbidden if there is no Shar’i evidence to that effect. As the Sunnah permits wearing silver rings, this is evidence that wearing silver is permissible…” (Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 25/63-65)         
Can men wear chains?
With regard to wearing chains, this is not permissible for men, because this is an imitation of women, and there is no report which says that it is permissible for men to wear chains made of silver.
Wearing adornments on the wrist and neck, and on the ears is an imitation of women, as this is something that is only for women. So it is not permissible for men to wear bracelets, earrings, anklets, or chains.
