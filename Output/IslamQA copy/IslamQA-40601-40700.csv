40608,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/40608,What should a menstruating woman do from the meeqaat until the end of Hajj?,What should a woman do if her period comes at the beginning of the days of Hajj before she enters Makkah?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.If a menstruating woman passes the meeqaat and intends to enter ihraam from the meeqaat, then when she reaches Makkah she should do all the actions of Hajj except for tawaaf around the House and saa’i between al-Safa and al-Marwah, which she should delay until she becomes pure. This is also what a woman should do if her period comes after she enters ihraam and before she does tawaaf. 
But if her period comes after doing tawaaf, then she may do saa’i between al-Safa and al-Marwah even if she is menstruating.  
The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked: 
What is the ruling on a menstruating woman doing Hajj? 
They replied: 
A menstruating woman is allowed to do Hajj. The one who enters ihraam has to do all the actions of Hajj, but she should not circumambulate the House until her period ends and she does ghusl. The same applies to women who are bleeding following childbirth. If they do all the essential parts of Hajj then their Hajj is valid. 
Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah li’l-Buhooth al-‘Ilmiyyah wa’l-Ifta’, 11/172-173. 
Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen said: 
If a woman intends to do ‘umrah, it is not permissible for her to pass the meeqaat without entering ihraam, even if she is menstruating. So she should enter ihraam even if she is menstruating and her ihraam is valid. The evidence for that is the fact that Asma’ bint ‘Umays, the wife of Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with them both) gave birth, when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was camped at Dhu’l-Hulayfah on his way to perform the Farewell Pilgrimage. She sent word to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) asking him what she should do. He said: “Do ghusl and tie a piece of cloth around yourself and enter ihraam.” 
The blood of menstruation is like the blood of nifaas. So we say to the menstruating woman: if she passes the meeqaat and she intends to do ‘Umrah or Hajj, we say to her: Do ghusl, tie a piece of cloth around yourself and enter ihraam. What is meant by tying a piece of cloth is placing a piece of cloth over the vagina and tying it in place, then entering ihraam whether for Hajj or ‘Umrah. But when she enters ihraam and reaches Makkah, she should not go to the Ka’bah or circumambulate it until she becomes pure. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to ‘Aa’ishah, when she menstruated during ‘umrah: “Do everything that the pilgrims do, but do not circumambulate the House until you become pure.” This report was narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim. According to Saheeh al-Bukhaari ‘Aa’ishah stated that when she became pure she circumambulated the House and did saa’i between al-Safa and al-Marwah. This indicates that if a woman enters ihraam for Hajj or ‘Umrah when she is menstruating, or her period comes before she does tawaaf, then she should not do tawaaf or saa’i until she becomes pure and does ghusl. But if she did tawaaf when she was pure and after she finished tawaaf her period came, then she should continue and do saa’i even if she is menstruating, and she should cut her hair and end her ‘umrah, because tahaarah (purity) is not essential for saa’i between al-Safa and al-Marwah.

40618,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/40618,Can she uncover her face in front of her sister’s husband?,"My sister’s husband sleeps in our house sometimes and sometimes he stays all day, and I cannot cover my face in front of him. Am I sinning thereby? What is the solution?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Your sister’s husband is a stranger (non-mahram) to you, and you have to cover your face in front of him and not be alone with him. Similarly it is haraam for him to look at you or to be alone with you. Unfortunately people are careless in their homes with regard to the in-laws, even though sharee’ah speaks strongly concerning them more than others, because people mix freely with them in their houses and the family members trust them. 
It was narrated from ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Aamir that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Beware of entering upon women.” A man from among the Ansaar said: “O Messenger of Allaah, what about the in-law?” He said: “The in-law is death.” 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4934; Muslim, 2172. 
The in-law is the husband’s relative. 
We notice here that the Sahaabi wanted to make an exception in the case of the husband’s relatives, but the ruling was re-emphasized in the strongest terms, because no one regards it as strange if he enters the house. 
Al-Nawawi said: 
With regard to the Prophet’s words, “The in-law is death,” what this means is that the fear in his case is greater than in the case of others, and evil is expected on his part and the fitnah (temptation) is greater, because he is able to reach the woman and be alone with her with no one denouncing him, unlike the stranger or non-mahram. What is meant by the in-law here is the husband’s relatives, except for his father/grandfather and sons/grandsons.His father/grandfather and sons/grandsons are mahrams of the wife and it is permissible for them to be alone with her; they are not described as “death”. Rather what is meant here is the brother, nephew, uncle, cousin and others who are not mahrams. People customarily take things lightly with regard to them, so a man will often be alone with his brother’s wife. This is what is described as death and it is more important that he be stopped than a stranger, for the reasons we have mentioned above. What I have mentioned is the correct meaning of the hadeeth… Ibn al-A’raabi said: This is something that the Arabs say, as in the phrase al-asad al-mawt (the lion is death), because meeting it is like dying. Al-Qaadi said: What is meant is that being alone with the in-laws leads to fitnah (temptation) and the destruction of one’s religious commitment, so this is described as being akin to the destruction of death.  
Sharh Muslim, 14/154. 
We advise this sister and others to fear Allaah and strive to wear proper hijaab in front of non-mahram men.

40649,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/40649,Do not betray the one who betrays you,"There is a person who works in a private office, but he had some health problems and had to stop working during the period of medical treatment. After that he went back to work and asked for his rights (his wages) for the days when he had worked, but his boss did not acknowledge his rights. This person is in need of the money, so he started to take some from the amount that he collects each day during the course of his work. He does not want to do anything except take what is due to him, no more than that. Is this haraam or halaal?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not 
    permissible for him to do that, because the money that he is taking, 
    claiming that he is entitled to it, is something that his boss has entrusted 
    him with, and the one who is entrusted with something is obliged to honour 
    that trust and render it back to its owner. It is not permissible for him to 
    betray him with regard to that.

“Verily, 
    Allaah commands that you should render back the trusts to those, to whom 
    they are due”

Fataawa 
    al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 15/145 
Shaykh 
    al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 30/372: 
If a man has a right due 
    to him from another, can he take it or its equivalent without his 
    permission? This falls into two categories:  
1 – If the 
    reason for his demanding his right is obvious and does not require proof, 
    such as a woman’s right to maintenance from her husband, or the child’s 
    right to maintenance from his father, or the guest’s right to hospitality 
    from the people with whom he is staying, then in this case he has the right 
    to take it without permission from the one who owes that to him without a 
    doubt. It was proven in al-Saheehayn that Hind bint ‘Utbah ibn 
    Rabee’ah said: “O Messenger of Allaah, Abu Sufyaan is a stingy man and he 
    does not give me sufficient maintenance for myself and my child.” He said: 
    “Take what is sufficient for you and your child, on a reasonable basis.” In 
    this report the Prophet (S) permitted her to take her maintenance, on a 
    reasonable basis, without asking the permission of the owner of the money. 
    Similarly, if it is known that a person’s wealth has clearly been wrongfully 
    seized and the people know about that, he may take the seized wealth or its 
    equivalent from the one who seized it, and so on. 
2 – If the 
    reason for demanding his right is not obvious, such as when a person denies 
    that he owes him money, or denies that he seized his wealth unlawfully, and 
    the claimant has no proof. There are two scholarly views in this case. One 
    is that he should not take it; this is the view of Maalik and Ahmad. The 
    other is that he can take it; this is the view of al-Shaafa’i. 
Those who say that he 
    should not take it if he has no clear proof of his right quote as evidence 
    the report narrated in al-Sunan from Abu Hurayrah, that the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Render back the 
    trust to the one who entrusted it to you, and do not betray those who betray 
    you.” And in al-Musnad it is narrated that Basheer ibn al-Khasaasah 
    said: “O Messenger of Allaah, we have neighbours who do not leave anything, 
    great or small, but they take it. If we have the opportunity to take 
    something from them, should we take it?” He said, “No. Render back the trust 
    to the one who entrusted it to you, and do not betray those who betray you.” 
     
These 
    ahaadeeth explain that if the right of the one who is wronged is not 
    obvious, and he takes it in a sneaky manner, he does not have the right to 
    do that, even if all he intends is to take something equivalent to his 
    right, but he does that by betraying someone who trusted him. That is 
    because when he entrusted him with his wealth and he took some of it without 
    his permission and there is no clear proof of his rights, then this is a 
    betrayal of trust. 
That is 
    because betrayal in and of itself is haraam, so it should not be used as a 
    means of taking one’s rights. Betrayal is akin to lying. If it is said that 
    this is not a betrayal, rather it is taking one’s rights and the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) only forbade betraying the one who betrays you, in the sense of taking more from his wealth than is your right – it should be noted that this argument is weak on a number of counts, one of which is that in the hadeeth it says, “we have neighbours who do not leave anything, great or small, but they take it. If we have the opportunity to take something from them, should we take it?”  He said, “No. Render back the trust to the one who entrusted it to you, and do not betray those who betray you.”  The second is that he said: “Do not betray those who betray you,” i.e., you should not respond to the one who betrays you by doing the same thing to him as he did to you. The third is that this action is undoubtedly a betrayal. Rather those who allowed it did so as a retaliatory measure, because there are cases in which retaliation is allowed, such as murder, banditry and seizing wealth unlawfully. And there are some cases in which retaliation is not allowed, such as immoral actions, lying, etc. When he said here, “Do not betray those who betray you,” it is known that this is a case in which it is not permitted to punish in like manner.",Islam Q&A

Is selling pork prohibited?


Is there proof that it is permissible to sell to non-Muslims?","Praise be to Allah.Ruling on giving Fatwas without knowledge
It is not permissible for anyone to issue Fatwas concerning the religion of Allah without knowledge. It is essential to understand the seriousness of doing that, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say (O Muhammad): (But) the things that my Lord has indeed forbidden are great evil sins (and every kind of unlawful sexual intercourse) whether committed openly or secretly, sins (of all kinds), unrighteous oppression, joining partners (in worship) with Allah for which He has given no authority, and saying things about Allah of which you have no knowledge.” [Al-`Araf 7:33]
So it is not permissible for anyone to say, this is lawful and that is prohibited, if he has no sound evidence to that effect. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And say not concerning that which your tongues put forth falsely: `This is lawful and this is forbidden,’ so as to invent lies against Allah. Verily, those who invent lies against Allah will never prosper.” [An-Nahl 16:116]
Is selling pork prohibited?
Selling pork is prohibited whether it is sold to a Muslim or to a non-Muslim. The evidence for that is as follows: 

Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“Say (O Muhammad): I find not in that which has been revealed to me anything forbidden to be eaten by one who wishes to eat it, unless it be a dead animal or blood poured forth (by slaughtering or the like), or the flesh of pork; for that surely, is impure or impious (unlawful) meat (of an animal) which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allah (or has been slaughtered for idols, or on which Allah’s Name has not been mentioned while slaughtering.” [Al-An`am 6:145]
And the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught us an important principle when he said: “When Allah forbids a thing, He (also) forbids its price.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 3488; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Ghayat Al-Maram, 318) 

It was narrated from Jabir ibn `Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) that he heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say when he was in Makkah at the time of the Conquest: “Allah and His Messenger have forbidden the sale of alcohol , dead meat, pork and idols.” It was said: “O Messenger of Allah, what do you think of the fat of dead animals, for ships are caulked with it and animal skins are daubed with it, and the people use it to light their lamps?” He said: “No, it is prohibited.” Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “May Allah curse the Jews, for when Allah forbade them animal fat, they melted it down and sold it, and consumed its price.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1212 and Muslim, 1581) 

An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“With regard to dead meat, alcohol and pork, the Muslims unanimously agreed that it is prohibited to sell all of these. 
Al-Qadi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This Hadith indicates that whatever we are forbidden to eat or make use of, we are also forbidden to sell, and it is not permissible to consume its price, as in the case of the animal fat mentioned in this Hadith.” (Sharh Muslim, 11/8) 
Ibn Rajab Al-Hanbali (may Allah have mercy on him) said, after quoting the Hadiths about the prohibition on alcohol: 
“The conclusion we may draw from all these Hadiths is that whatever Allah has forbidden us to make use of, it is also prohibited to sell it and consume its price, as is stated clearly in the Hadith: “When Allah forbids a thing, He (also) forbids its price.” This is a general, comprehensive phrase which applies to everything which is intended to be used in prohibited ways. These fall into two categories: 

Things which are to be used and will remain as they are, such as idols. The purpose for which they are used is Shirk or association of others with Allah, which is the greatest of all sins. We may add to that books of Shirk, witchcraft, innovation (Bid’ah) and misguidance, forbidden images, forbidden means of entertainment and also buying slave women who will serve as singers.
Things which are to be used and which will be used up. If in the majority of cases a thing is used for prohibited purposes, then it is prohibited to sell it. For example, it is prohibited to sell pork, alcohol and dead meat even though they may – on rare occasions – be used for a permissible purpose, such as eating dead meat for those who are in extreme need, or using alcohol to stop oneself choking or to put out a fire, or using pig hairs for beading, or making use of the hair and skin of a pig – according to those who approve of that.  But because these are not the reason for which these things are produced, and the usual use for pigs and dead meat is to eat them, and the usual use for alcohol is to drink it, so no attention should be paid to these reasons, and it is prohibited to sell these things.

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) indicated this when it was said to him: “What do you think of the fat of dead animals, for ships are caulked with it and animal skins are daubed with it, and the people use it to light their lamps?”  He said: “No, it is prohibited.” (Jami` Al-`Ulum wal-Hikam, 1/415, 416)
The Standing Committee was asked: Is it permissible to deal in alcohol and pork if one is not selling them to a Muslim? 
They replied:
“It is not permissible to deal in foods and other things that Allah has forbidden, such as alcohol and pork, even if one is selling them to non-Muslims, because it is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When Allah forbids a thing, He also forbids its price.” And because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed alcohol, the one who drinks it, the one who sells it, the one who buys it, the one who carries it, the one to whom it is carried, the one who consumes its price, the one who squeezes (the grapes, etc.) and the one for whom it is squeezed.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 13/49) 
Is there proof that it is permissible to sell to non-Muslims? 
With regard to the questioner saying, “selling pork to non-Muslims is not prohibited, and there is no text in the Quran or Sunnah that says that it is prohibited to sell it to non-Muslims”, this is not correct. 
We have quoted above evidence from the Quran and Sunnah, and have stated that the scholars are agreed that it is prohibited to sell pork. The general meaning of the evidence indicates that it is prohibited to sell it to Muslims and non-Muslims alike, because the evidence indicates that the prohibition on selling it is general in application, and no differentiation is made between Muslims and others. 
Indeed, if we were to say that what is meant by the prohibition on selling it is selling it to non-Muslims, that would not be far-fetched, because the basic assumption concerning the Muslim is that he would never buy pork: what would he do with it when he knows that Allah has forbidden it? 
Similarly, the questioner’s saying that “pork existed at the time of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and if he had wanted to forbid it and curse it he would have done so as he did with alcohol” is also not correct, because it is not essential for a thing to be forbidden that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) should have cursed the one who does it. Rather it is sufficient that he forbade it or stated that it is prohibited, as he forbade the sale of pork. 
With regard to your taking this money, now that you know that it is prohibited, it is more befiiting for you to refuse to take it, especially since your taking it is like giving approval to what the company owner is doing. You have to advise him, denounce what he is doing and exhort him to give up these prohibited actions. Whoever gives up something for the sake of Allah, Allah will compensate him with something better than it. 
With regard to the money that you took before you found out that it is prohibited, there is no sin on you, in sha Allah. Allah says in the verses in which He forbids Riba (usury, interest) (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So whosoever receives an admonition from his Lord and stops eating Riba , shall not be punished for the past; his case is for Allah (to judge).” [Al-Baqarah 2:275]

 What is the ruling on my fast, and how can I expiate for this grave sin? Please note that I do not know how many days I did this.","If you engaged in masturbation but no semen came out as a result, then the fast is not invalidated. If it did come out, then the fast was invalidated and you have to make up the missed day.",,"Praise be to Allah.It should be noted that masturbation is haram according to Shari’ah, as is indicated in the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
Masturbation is something that is repulsive to sound human nature and reason, and it is not befitting for a Muslim to lower himself to this level. 
It should also be noted that masturbation has negative consequences for a person , in this world and in the Hereafter, if he does not repent and if Allah does not bestow His mercy upon him. 
With regard to the ruling on the matter mentioned in the question, if you engaged in masturbation but no semen came out as a result, then the fast is not invalidated, according to the most sound scholarly opinion, because what matters is the emission of semen . If it did come out then the fast was invalidated and it has to be made up. If it did not come out then the fast is not invalidated. But whatever the case you have to repent to Allah and seek His forgiveness for wasting the fast by doing such things. 
Semen may be emitted a short while later even if you prevented it from coming out. In that case the fast of that day is invalidated and you have to make it up. If you do not know how many days your fast was invalidated, then try to work it out until you reach a figure you think is most likely, then make up the days that you owe. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said in Sharh Zad al-Mustaqni’: Is it possible for semen to move without being emitted? 
“Yes, that is possible, when a person’s desire subsides for some reason, then semen does not come out. 
And they gave another example: if a person holds his penis so that no semen comes out. Even though the fuqaha gave this as an example, it is very harmful. The fuqaha (may Allah have mercy on them) gave something as an example regardless of how harmful or not it may be. But usually in such cases the semen is released after the person lets go of his penis. 
Some of the scholars said that ghusl is not required if the semen moves. This is the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam and is the correct view. The evidence for that is as follows:  
1- The hadith of Umm Salamah in which it says: “Yes, if she sees water.” He did not say, If she feels it moving. If ghusl were required when it moves, then he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would have pointed it out because there would have been a need to do so.
2- The hadith of Abu Sa’id al-Khudri: “Water is for water.” In this case there is no water (i.e., emission). So this hadith indicates that if there is no water (emission) there is no need for water (ghusl).
3- The basic principle is that the person remains pure (tahir) and no ghusl is required. This principle cannot be changed unless there is evidence to that effect.” (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 1/280)

“The Angel of Death” is well known by the name Azra’il, but this is not correct, rather this was narrated from Jewish sources.

If he/she is poor and cannot feed others, then fasting and repentance is sufficient and he/she does not have to feed others.",,"Praise be to Allah.She has to make up for those days, and to be on the safe side she should feed one poor person for each day. 
Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked (15/184): 
I have a sister who for several years did not make up the fasts that she missed because of her period, because she was unaware of the ruling, especially since some of the common folk told her that she did not have to make up the fasts that she missed. What should she do? 
He (may Allah have mercy on him) replied: 
“She has to ask Allah for forgiveness and repent to Him, and she has to fast the days that she missed and feed one poor person for each day , as was stated by a number of the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). This means giving half a Sa`, which is equivalent to one and a half kilograms. What some ignorant women told her about her not having to do anything does not mean that this obligation is waived. `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “We were commanded to make up the missed fasts but we were not told to make up the prayers.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim) 
If another Ramadan comes before she makes up the missed fasts, then she is sinning and she has to make up the missed fasts and repent, and also feed one poor person for each day if she is able to.
If she is poor and cannot feed others, then fasting and repentance is sufficient and she does not have to feed others. 
If she cannot remember how many days she has to fast, she should proceed on the basis of what she thinks is most likely, and fast the days that she thinks she missed during Ramadan, and that will be sufficient, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can.” [At-Taghabun 64:16]”
The Standing Committee (10/151) was asked about an elderly woman who had reached the age of sixty, and she was unaware of the ruling on menstruation for all the years during which she used to menstruate, so she did not make up any missed Ramadan fasts because she thought that she did not have to make them up, based on what she had heard from the common folk. 
The committee replied: 
“She has to repent to Allah from that, because she did not ask the people of knowledge. As well as that she also has to make up the days that she did not fast, according to what she thinks is most likely to be the number of days that she missed, and she should offer expiation for each day by feeding one poor person half a Sa` of wheat, dates, rice or whatever is the staple food of the country, if she is able to do so. If she cannot feed others, then she does not have to do that and it is sufficient for her to make up the fasts.”

Is this regarded as one of the things that invalidate the fast?","Acid reflux is something that happens involuntarily.

Does vomiting break your fast?","Praise be to Allah.Does acid reflux break your fast?
Acid reflux is something that happens involuntarily. A person may feel some acidity or bitter taste in his esophagus but it does not reach the mouth. In this case, it is not regarded as one of the things that invalidate the fast, because it does not come out to the mouth. 
But if it comes out to the mouth, then in that case it comes under the ruling on reflux or vomiting. 
Does vomiting break your fast?
The word qalas (translated above as reflux) was interpreted as meaning vomiting , or as referring to a small amount of vomit that reaches the throat but does not fill the mouth. And it was said that it was that which is regurgitated by the stomach when it is full. (See al-Majmu’ by al-Nawawi, 4/4)
The ruling on this is that if it is returned to the stomach when it could have been expelled, this breaks the fast, and if a person swallows it because he is unable to expel it, then it does not affect the fast. 
It says in al-Sharh al-Saghir (1/700) concerning qalas: 
“If he is not able to expel it – such as when it does not pass the throat – then he does not have to do anything.”  
Ibn Hazm said in al-Muhalla (4/225): 
“Reflux that comes out of the throat does not invalidate the fast, so long as the person does not deliberately swallow it back after it reaches the mouth when he is able to expel it.” 
Then he said (4/348): 
“We do not know of any difference of opinion concerning the fact that reflux and blood, which come out from a person and do not go back to the throat, do not invalidate the fast. Even if there were a differing opinion, we would not pay any attention to it, because there is no text that says that this invalidates the fast.” 
It says in al-Muntaqa Sharh al-Muwatta (2/65): 
“It was narrated from Malik that he said: Whoever burps and reflux reaches his mouth but he swallows it back down, he does not have to make up that day of the Ramadan fast. Ibn al-Qasim said: Malik said: If it comes out to a place where if he wanted to he could expel it, but then he swallows it back down, then he has to make up that fast. If he suppresses it before that, then he does not have to do anything.” 
It says in al-Insaf: 
“If some vomit or reflux reaches his mouth and he swallows it, then he has broken his fast. This was stated by Imam Ahmad. This ruling applies even if it is a little because it is possible to avoid doing that.” 
It says in Hashiyat al-‘Adawi (1/448), after mentioning the ruling on reflux: 
“Reflux is like vomit , which is what is regurgitated by the stomach when it is full.”

40698,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/40698,Water entering the throat by mistake,"If water enters the throat by mistake when rinsing the nose during wudoo’, does that invalidate the fast?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.None of the things that break the fast – apart from menstruation and bleeding following childbirth – invalidate the fast unless three conditions are met: 
(i)that the person knows that this breaks the fast and is not unaware of that
(ii)that he remembered that he was fasting and had not forgotten
(iii)that he does it voluntarily and is not coerced.
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If a fasting person does any of these things that break the fast without meaning to, then his fast remains valid. If he rinses his mouth and some water reaches his stomach without him meaning it to, then his fast is valid. Majmoo’ al-Fataawa 19. 
And he (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If a gnat flies into the mouth of a fasting person or something enters his mouth without him wanting it to, or he rinses his mouth or nose and some water reaches his throat without him meaning it to, then his fast is still valid and he does not have to make it up. Majaalis Sharh Ramadaan, no. 15. 
Based on the above, if the water enters the stomach by accident, then he does not have to do anything, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And there is no sin on you concerning that in which you made a mistake, except in regard to what your hearts deliberately intend”
[al-Ahzaab 33:5]
It should be noted that the fasting person is not allowed to go to extremes in rinsing the nose, so that water will not go down into his stomach by accident. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Go to extremes in rinsing the nose except when you are fasting.”
