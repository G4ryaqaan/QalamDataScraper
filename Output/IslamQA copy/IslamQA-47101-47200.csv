47103,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47103,His father gave him more than he gave to him; is this regarded as riba?,"I pay for some household goods for my father from my own pocket, say 150 riyals, with the intention of it being an act of charity, but sometimes my father gives me 200 riyals and says, “Don’t pay from your pocket.” If he gives me 200 riyals is this regarded as riba?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Honouring one’s parents is one of the greatest means of 
    attaining Paradise. What a great loss it is if a person’s parents reach old 
    age and he does not make honouring them a means of entering Paradise. The 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “May his nose 
    be rubbed in the dust, may his nose be rubbed in the dust, may his nose be 
    rubbed in the dust.” It was said: “Who, O Messenger of Allaah?” He said: 
    “The one who lives to see his parents reach old age, one or both of them, 
    and he does not enter Paradise because of them.” Narrated by Muslim, 2551. 
    See also questions no. 22782 and 
    5326. 

    One of the ways of charity through which a person may seek 
    reward with Allaah is to spend on his parents and take care of them with his 
    own wealth. By doing that you will have the reward of doing charity in sha 
    Allaah. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “If a person spends on his parents, seeking reward, it will be an act of 
    charity for him.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 55. 

    With regard to your question, if you buy goods for your 
    father worth 150 riyals and he gives you 200, there is no sin in that, as he 
    has voluntarily given you more than you paid. There is no riba in this case. 
    Riba can hardly be imagined between a son and his father, and both of you 
    are doing well in sha Allah. You wanted to give him the value of the goods 
    and he wanted to give you something extra. We ask Allaah to reward you both 
    and to bless you both in your wealth.",Islam Q&A
47123,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47123,Sometimes he feels too lazy to pray – what is the remedy?,"I am a young Muslim man who believes in Allaah and His Messengers and His Books, praise be to Allaah. But sometimes I feel too lazy to pray. I am looking for a solution and a way to make me not be so lazy. Please note that this is what I want but the tricks of the Shaytaan are too strong.",,,"Praise be to Allah.If a person truly believes in Allaah, His Messengers and His Books, and believes that prayer is obligatory and is the greatest pillar of Islam after the Shahaadatayn, we cannot imagine that he would neglect to pray or be careless in performing the prayers. Rather he would never feel at ease unless he performs this important ritual regularly. 
The more a person’s faith increases, the more he will be concerned to do that which Allaah has enjoined upon him, and this is also because of his strong faith. Hence the way to make you pray more regularly may be summed up as follows: 
1 – You should believe firmly that prayer is obligatory and that it is the greatest pillar of Islam. You should realize that a stern warning is issued to the one who neglects prayer, and he is a kaafir who is beyond the pale of Islam according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions, based on a great deal of evidence, such as the hadeeth in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Between a man and shirk and kufr there stands his giving up prayer.” Narrated by Muslim, 82. 
And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The covenant that stands between us and them is prayer; whoever gives it up is a kaafir.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2621; al-Nasaa’i, 463; Ibn Maajah, 1079; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
2 – You should understand that delaying prayer beyond the time when it is due is a major sin, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Then, there has succeeded them a posterity who have given up As-Salaah (the prayers) [i.e. made their Salaah (prayers) to be lost, either by not offering them or by not offering them perfectly or by not offering them in their proper fixed times] and have followed lusts. So they will be thrown in Hell”
[Maryam 19:59]
Ibn Mas’ood said concerning al-Ghayy [translated in the verse quoted above as Hell): This is a valley in Hell which is very deep and foul. 
And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So woe unto those performers of Salaah (prayers) (hypocrites),
5. Those who delay their Salaah (prayer from their stated fixed times)”
[al-Maa’oon :4,5]
3 – You should strive to offer the prayers in congregation in the mosque, and not neglect any of them, knowing that praying in congregation in the mosque is obligatory according to the more sound of the two scholarly opinions, based on a great deal of evidence, such as the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Whoever hears the call to prayer and does not respond, his prayer is not valid unless he has an excuse.” Narrated by Ibn Maajah, 793; also by al-Daaraqutni and al-Haakim, who classed it as saheeh; also classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah. 
Muslim (653) narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: A blind man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: “O Messenger of Allaah, I do not have anyone to guide me to the mosque,” and he asked the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to give him a dispensation allowing him to pray in his home and he allowed him that, then when he turned away he called him back and said: “Can you hear the call to prayer?’ He said, “Yes.” He said: “Then answer it.” 
And there is other evidence too. See question no. 40113. 
4 – There is the hope that if you adhere to that, you will be included among the seven whom Allaah will shade with His shade (on the Day of Resurrection), among whom is “a young man who grew up worshipping his Lord” and “a man whose heart was attached to the mosque”. Al-Bukhaari, 660; Muslim, 1031. 
5 – You will earn the great reward for prayer, especially prayer in congregation. In al-Saheehayn it is narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “A man’s prayer in congregation is twenty-five times better than his praying in his house or marketplace, because when he does wudoo’ and does it well, then goes out to the mosque, only going there to pray, he does not take a single step but he is raised in status and a sin is erased thereby. When he prays, the angels continue to send blessings upon him so long as he is still in the place where he prayed, (saying), ‘O Allaah, send blessings on him, O Allaah have mercy on him.’ And one of you is still in a state of prayer so long as he is waiting for the prayer.” 
Al-Bukhaari, 647; Muslim, 649. 
Muslim (232) narrated that ‘Uthmaan ibn ‘Affaan said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “Whoever does wudoo’ for prayer and does wudoo’ well, then walks to (perform) the prescribed prayer, and offers the prayer with the people or with the congregation or in the mosque, Allaah will forgive him his sins.” 
6 – You should read about the virtue of prayer, and the sin of those who are careless or too lazy to pray. We advise you in particular to read the book Al-Salaah, limadha (Prayer – why?) by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ismaa’eel al-Muqaddim; and listen to the lecture, “Limadha la tusalli (Why don’t you pray?) by Shaykh Muhammad Husayn Ya’qoob, as these will be very beneficial for you in sha Allaah. 
7 – You should choose good friends who are keen to pray and pay attention to that, and keep away from those who are the opposite, because a person is influenced by his friends. 
8 – Keep away from sin in all aspects of your life, and adhere to the rulings of sharee’ah in your dealings with others, especially with women, because sin is one of the things that most distract a person from doing acts of worship and increase the Shaytaan’s influence on him. 
We ask Allaah to make us and you among His righteous slaves and those who are close to Him.

47130,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47130,Fighting witchcraft with witchcraft to solve marital problems,What is your advice to one who fights witchcraft with witchcraft in order to solve marital problems?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
      Firstly:  

    Curing a person who have been bewitched or had a spell cast 
    on him, if it done by permissible means, comes under the heading of the 
    treatment of sickness and disease. It is one of the best of deeds if one 
    seeks the pleasure of Allaah thereby, especially if that is also for the 
    purpose of solving marital or family problems. 

    There are two scenarios that may apply in curing one who has 
    been bewitched: 

    1 – Lifting the spell by means of further witchcraft, where 
    the practitioner of witchcraft and the sick person seek to draw close to the 
    jinns and devils in order to cure the spell. This is haraam and it is a 
    great evil and the work of the Shaytaan, as it says in Musnad Ahmad 
    (3/294) and Sunan Abi Dawood (3868), where it is narrated that Jaabir 
    ibn ‘Abd-Allaah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was asked about 
    nushrah, and he said, “It is the work of the Shaytaan.” Classed as 
    saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 3868. 

    Nushrah means curing a person who has been bewitched. What is 
    referred to here is the type of nushrah that was used during the 
    Jaahiliyyah, which is curing witchcraft by means of witchcraft or by using 
    the services of the devils. 

    See al-Qawl al-Mufeed ‘ala Kitaab al-Tawheed, by 
    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him). 

    The way in which this hadeeth indicates that it is haraam is 
    that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) described 
    it as being the work of the Shaytaan, and whatever is the work of the 
    Shaytaan is haraam, for the Shaytaan enjoins evil, immorality and saying of 
    Allaah what one does not know. 

    2 – Lifting the spell by means of the ruqyahs and prayers for 
    refuge with Allaah that are prescribed in Islam, and using permissible kinds 
    of medicine. This is permissible and is a righteous deed for which a person 
    will be rewarded, so long as he observes the proper etiquette of treatment 
    and performing ruqyah. See question no. 12918. 

    Secondly: 

    Our advice to the who uses witchcraft to fight witchcraft is 
    to fear Allaah and to hasten to repent from this action which poses a threat 
    to his religious commitment and his Islam, before the Angel of Death comes 
    down to him and catches him unawares, whereupon regret will be to no avail 
    and there will be no turning back. The danger that witchcraft poses to one's 
    religious commitment is very real and very serious. Allaah has told us in 
    His Book that learning and teaching witchcraft is kufr as He says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “They followed what the Shayaateen (devils) gave out (falsely 
    of the magic) in the lifetime of Sulaymaan (Solomon). Sulaymaan did not 
    disbelieve, but the Shayaateen (devils) disbelieved, teaching men magic and 
    such things that came down at Babylon to the two angels, Haaroot and 
    Maaroot, but neither of these two (angels) taught anyone (such things) till 
    they had said, ‘We are for trial, so disbelieve not (by learning this magic 
    from us).’”

    [al-Baqarah 2:102]

    So learning and teaching witchcraft constitutes kufr or 
    disbelief in Allaah. In al-Saheehayn it is narrated from Abu Hurayrah 
    (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) said: “Avoid the seven (sins) that doom a person to 
    Hell.” They said: “O Messenger of Allaah, what are they?” He said: 
    “Associating others with Allaah (shirk), witchcraft, killing a soul whom 
    Allaah has forbidden killing, except in cases required by law, consuming 
    riba, consuming the orphan’s wealth, running away from the battlefield, and 
    slandering chaste and innocent believing women.”  

    These are all sins which will doom a person to Hell, so let 
    this practitioner of witchcraft beware of the wrath and punishment of 
    Allaah, for His punishment is painful and severe. Let him beware of the 
    traps of the Shaytaan who makes this deed appear attractive and makes him 
    think that it is in the interests of the Muslims and a solution to their 
    problems, until he drags him to Hell and causes him to be thrown therein, 
    what a terrible end. Beware, for the matter is very serious, it is the 
    matter of eternal bliss or eternal misery; we seek refuge with Allaah from 
    loss and utter misery. 

    Thirdly: 

    Our advice to the sick person who has been bewitched is to be 
    patient and seek reward from Allaah. He should realize that this is a test 
    through which he may raise his status before Allaah if he is patient and 
    seeks reward. Al-Tirmidhi (2396) and Ibn Maajah (4031) narrated from Anas 
    ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The greatest reward comes with the 
    greatest trial. When Allaah loves a people He tests them. Whoever accepts 
    that wins His pleasure but whoever is discontent with that earns His wrath.” 
    Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 2396. 

    He should depend on Allaah alone and put his trust in Him in 
    all his affairs, as well as following the means prescribed in sharee’ah and 
    the permissible practical means of treating his disease. He should turn to 
    Allaah and beseech Him with du’aa’ at the end of the night, and following 
    each prayer, for Allaah is the One who removes harm and relieves distress. 
    He is merciful to His believing slaves and answers the du’aa’ of the one who 
    is in difficulty. 

    “Is not He (better than your gods) Who responds to the 
    distressed one, when he calls on Him, and Who removes the evil, and makes 
    you inheritors of the earth, generations after generations? Is there any 
    ilaah (god) with Allaah? Little is that you remember!”

    [al-Naml 27:62]

    Let him beware of approaching the ways of witchcraft, 
    soothsaying and fortunetelling, for they are a disease and a malady which 
    lead to certain doom. In Saheeh Muslim (2230) it is narrated from one 
    of the wives of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “Whoever goes to a fortune teller and asks him about anything, his prayers 
    will not accepted for forty days.” In Musnad al-Imam Ahmad (9252) it 
    is narrated from Abu Hurayrah and al-Hasan (may Allaah be pleased with them) 
    that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “Whoever goes to a soothsayer or a fortune teller and believes what he says 
    has disbelieved in that which was revealed to Muhammad.” Classed as saheeh 
    by Shaykh al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 5939. So let the Muslim 
    beware of asking them about anything or believing them, in obedience to 
    Allaah and His Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), 
    and so as to protect his religious commitment and his belief (‘aqeedah), and 
    out of fear of the punishment of Allaah, and so as to avoid the things that 
    lead to shirk and kufr, for whoever dies in a state of shirk or kufr will 
    have lost in this world and in the Hereafter, and that is true loss. 

    For more information on this matter and the ways of treating 
    witchcraft that are prescribed in sharee’ah, please see questions no.

47142,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47142,Giving women gifts as a compensation for taking their inheritance,What is your opinion on those who give women gifts as a compensation for taking their inheritance?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    During the Jaahiliyyah, the wealth of the deceased would be 
    given to his oldest son; if he had no son then it would go to his brother or 
    paternal uncle. Children and women did not inherit, on the grounds that they 
    could not protect that which should be protected (one’s family and one's 
    honour), nor did they fight or earn booty in war. 

    All of these are jaahili ideas which have been revived in the 
    hearts of some of those whose nature has become distorted in these times. 
    Islam came to declare the Jaahili system of inheritance to be false in 
    general terms, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “There is a share for men and a share for women from what 
    is left by parents and those nearest related, whether, the property be small 
    or large — a legal share”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:7]
Then the verses were 
    revealed which explain how the estate is to be shared out among women and 
    men, with justice and wisdom from the Wisest of rulers. 

    See al-Tahqeeqaat al-Mardiyyah fi’l-Mabaahith al-Fardiyyah, 
    p. 17 
From this it may be 
    understood that depriving women of their inheritance with no legitimate 
    shar’i reason is a serious crime and a transgression against the laws of 
    Allaah and His sacred limits. Allaah says, following the verses on 
    inheritance (interpretation of the meaning): 
“These are the limits 
    (set by) Allaah (or ordainments as regards laws of inheritance), and 
    whosoever obeys Allaah and His Messenger (Muhammad) will be admitted to 
    Gardens under which rivers flow (in Paradise), to abide therein, and that 
    will be the great success.
14. And whosoever 
    disobeys Allaah and His Messenger (Muhammad), and transgresses His limits, 
    He will cast him into the Fire, to abide therein; and he shall have a 
    disgraceful torment”
[al-Nisa’ 4:13-14]

    and it was proven in the hadeeth of Abu Umaamah that the 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “Whoever appropriates the right of a Muslim by means of a (false) oath, 
    Allaah would decree Hell-fire forhim and would 
    forbid Paradise to him.” Aman said to him: “O 
    Messenger of Allah, even if it issomething 
    insignificant?” He said: “Even if it is the twig of the arak tree.” 

    With regard to giving women gifts to make up for not being 
    given their inheritance etc, this does not do any good at all and does not 
    absolve the sin of the one who does that, no matter what he gives, even if 
    he were to give them gifts that are worth more than their inheritance, 
    because he is giving them that as a gift and he is not giving them the share 
    of inheritance that is theirs according to sharee’ah. 

    If he gives it to them on the basis that it is compensation 
    for them, instead of their rights of inheritance, that will not do any good 
    at all either, because a gift is one thing and sales and compensation are 
    something else. Their rightful inheritance must be given to them, and they 
    must be enabled to dispose of it by keeping it as it is, selling it, giving 
    it away or whatever else an owner is entitled to do with his property. 

    With regard to keeping the inheritance under the control of 
    men, forcing women to sell it to them or to give it up in return for some 
    compensation, or with no compensation, this is not permitted, rather this is 
    usurping and oppression. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “O you who believe! Eat not up your property among 
    yourselves unjustly except it be a trade amongst you, by mutual consent”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:29]
And the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Transactions can only 
    take place by mutual consent.” Narrated by Ibn Maajah, 2185; classed as 
    saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah. 

    And he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “It is not permissible (to take) a person’s property except with his 
    consent.” Narrated by Ahmad, 20172; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in 
    Saheeh al-Jaami’, no. 7662. 
The same applies if what 
    makes a woman sell is her shyness in front of men and her eagerness to 
    please them, because of the general meaning of the evidence quoted above. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    A sale is not valid if it is based on compulsion, except when 
    there is a justifiable reason for that. If an unjust ruler forces a person 
    to sell this product to someone and he sells it, that transaction is not 
    valid, because it was not based on mutual consent. Similarly, if you know 
    that this vendor is selling to you out of shyness or embarrassment, it is 
    not permissible for you to buy from him so long as you know that if it were 
    not for his shyness or embarrassment he would not be selling it to you. 

    Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 8/121 
The sin is compounded 
    further if the women who is being deprived of her inheritance is an orphan, 
    i.e., she has not yet reached the age of puberty and her father has died, 
    and she has been deprived of her inheritance, because that is a 
    transgression of the limits set by Allaah, and also comes under the heading 
    of consuming orphans’ wealth. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, those who 
    unjustly eat up the property of orphans, they eat up only fire into their 
    bellies, and they will be burnt in the blazing Fire!”

Are they in Paradise or in Hell? We hope you can tell us of a hadith which proves the answer?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.There is a hadith from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) which indicates that they are in Hell. 
Muslim (203) narrated from Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) that a man said: “O Messenger of Allah, where is my father?” He said: “In Hell.” When he turned away he called him back and said: “My father and your father are in Hell.” 
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
This shows that whoever dies in a state of kufr will be in Hell. And being related to one who is close to Allah will not avail him anything. It also shows that whoever died during the fatrah (the interval between the Prophethood of ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) and that of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)) and was the follower of the way of the Arabs at that time, which was idol worship, will also be among the people of Hell. There is no excuse for the call not reaching them, because the call of Ibraaheem and other Prophets (peace be upon them) had reached these people. 
Muslim (976) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I asked my Lord for permission to pray for forgiveness for my mother, but He did not give me permission. And I asked Him for permission to visit her grave, and He gave me permission.” 
It says in ‘Awn al-Ma’bood: 
“But He did not give me permission” means: because she was a kaafirah (disbeliever) and it is not permissible to pray for forgiveness for the kuffaar. 
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
This shows that it is not permitted to pray for forgiveness for the kuffaar. 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “My father and your father are in Hell,” he spoke with knowledge, for he did not speak on the basis of his whims and desires, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“By the star when it goes down (or vanishes).
2. Your companion (Muhammad) has neither gone astray nor has erred.
3. Nor does he speak of (his own) desire.
4. It is only a Revelation revealed”
[al-Najm 53:1-4]
Were it not that proof has been established against ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib, the father of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would not have said what he did about him. Perhaps he had heard something that established proof against him on the basis of the religion of Ibraaheem, because they used to follow the religion of Ibraaheem until the innovations were introduced by ‘Amr ibn Luhayy al-Khuzaa’i and his innovations became widespread among the people, such as the propagation of idols and praying to them instead of to Allah. Perhaps ‘Abd-Allah had heard something that showed him that the idol worship of Quraysh was wrong, but he still followed them, and thus proof was established against him. Similarly, the hadith which says that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked for permission to pray for forgiveness for his mother but it was not granted, and he asked for permission to visit her grave and he was permitted to do so but not to pray for forgiveness for her, perhaps she had heard something that established proof against her, or perhaps the people of the Jaahiliyyah are to be treated as kuffaar as far as rulings in this world are concerned, so we should not pray for them or pray for forgiveness for them, because outwardly they seem to be kuffaar, and should be regarded and dealt with as such, and their case in the Hereafter is for Allah to judge. 
Fatawa Noor ‘ala al-Darb 
Al-Suyooti (may Allah have mercy on him) was of the view that the parents of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) will be saved (from Hell), and that Allah brought them back to life after they had died and they believed in him. 
This view was rejected by the majority of scholars who ruled that the ahaadith which indicate that are fabricated (mawdoo’) or very weak (da’eef jiddan). 
It says in ‘Awn al-Ma’bood: 
Most of the reports that been narrated to the effect that the parents of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) were brought back to life and believed in him and were saved are fabricated and false. Some of them are very weak and cannot be saheeh under any circumstances, as the imams of hadith are unanimously agreed that they are fabricated, such as al-Daaraqutni, al-Jawzaqaani, Ibn Shaheen, al-Khateeb, Ibn ‘Asaakir, Ibn Naasir, Ibn al-Jawzi, al-Suhayli, al-Qurtubi, al-Muhibb, al-Tabari, Fath al-Deen ibn Sayyid al-Naas, Ibraaheem al-Halabi and others. The scholar Ibraaheem al-Halabi explained at length the fact that the parents of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) have not been saved from Hell in a separate essay, as did ‘Ali al-Qaari in Sharh al-Fiqh al-Akbar and in a separate essay. The basis for this opinion is the  soundness of this hadith (“My father and your father are in Hell”). Shaykh Jalaal al-Deen al-Suyooti differed from the huffaaz and scholars and affirmed that they had believed and had been saved, and he wrote numerous essays on that topic, including al-Ta’zeem wa’l-Minnah fi anna Abaway Rasool-Illaah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) fi’l-Jannah. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Is there any saheeh report from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that Allah brought his parents back to life so that they could become Muslims, then they died (again) after that? 
He replied: There is no saheeh report to that effect from the scholars of hadith. Rather the scholars are agreed that this is an invented lie… There is no dispute among the scholars that this is one of the most obvious of fabrications, as was stated by those who have knowledge. That does not appear in any of the reliable books of hadith, either in the Saheehs or the Sunans or the Musnads or any other well-known books of hadith. It was not mentioned by the authors of the books of Maghaazi or Tafseer, even though they narrated da’eef (weak) reports along with saheeh (sound) ones. The fact that this is a lie is clear to any one who has any knowledge of religion. If such a thing had happened there would have been a great deal of motivation to transmit it, because it is something that is extraordinary on two counts: the raising of the dead and believing after death. Such a thing would have been more deserving of being transmitted than anything else. Since no trustworthy narrated transmitted it, it may be understood that this is a lie. 
Moreover, this goes against the Qur’aan and the saheeh Sunnah, and the consensus of the scholars. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allah accepts only the repentance of those who do evil in ignorance and foolishness and repent soon afterwards; it is they whom Allah will forgive and Allah is Ever All‑Knower, All‑Wise.
18. And of no effect is the repentance of those who continue to do evil deeds until death faces one of them and he says: ‘Now I repent;’ nor of those who die while they are disbelievers”
[al-Nisa’ 4:17-18]
So Allah states that there is no repentance for one who dies as a disbeliever. And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Then their Faith (in Islamic Monotheism) could not avail them when they saw Our punishment. (Like) this has been the way of Allah in dealing with His slaves. And there the disbelievers lost utterly (when Our Torment covered them)”
[Ghaafir 40:85]
 So He tells us that the way in which He deals with His slaves is that faith will be to no avail once they have seen the punishment, so how about after death? And there are other similar texts. Then he quoted the two hadith which we quoted at the beginning of our answer.

47190,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47190,Is he regarded as sponsoring an orphan if he simply pays money to a charity that sponsors orphans?,"I sponsor an orphan through Jama’iyyat al-Birr in Jeddah, paying 200 riyals a month which is given to the mother of the child through them. I am not responsible for anything else concerning the child apart from paying this money. Is this what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoined when he said, “I and the one who sponsors an orphan will be in Paradise”? Please advise me, may Allah reward you with good.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: sponsoring an orphan is one of the righteous deeds which Islam encourages us to do and tells us are among the means of entering Paradise, and indeed of attaining the highest positions therein. There is sufficient encouragement for the believer to do these actions in the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “I and the one who sponsors an orphan will be in Paradise like these two” – and he gestured with his forefinger and middle finger, holding them apart. Al-Bukhari, 5304. 
Ibn Battaal (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “It is a duty for the one who hears this hadeeth to act upon it, so that he will be with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in Paradise.” (Quoted by Ibn Hajar in Fath al-Bari, 10/436. 
Secondly: spending money on an orphan is something that is encouraged in particular. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “This money is fresh and sweet. Blessed is the wealth of the Muslim, from which he gives to the poor, the orphan and the wayfarer” or as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said it. Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1465; Muslim, 1052. 
But this spending is not the be-all and end-all of the sponsorship that is encouraged in Islam, for which a person is promised a high status in Paradise, rather it is just one kind and one aspect of sponsorship and kind treatment of the orphan until he grows up. Rather sponsorship in the complete sense means looking after him, guiding him with regard to his religious and worldly affairs, educating him, and treating him kindly until he is no longer regarded as an orphan (i.e., when he reaches adulthood). Ibn al-Atheer said: “The sponsor is the one who takes care of the orphan’s affairs and brings him up.” Al-Nihaayah, 4/192.  In Riyaadh al-Saaliheen, al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) defined the sponsor of an orphan as being the one who takes care of his affairs. The commentator on this book said: (that means) his religious and worldly affairs, by spending on him, clothing him, etc. Daleel al-Faaliheen, 3/103. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Sponsoring an orphan means taking care of his religious and worldly interests, teaching him and guiding him etc with regard to religious matters, and taking care of his food, drink, shelter and other worldly concerns. Sharh Riyaadh al-Saaliheen, 5/113. 
The religious and educational affairs of the orphan both come under the heading of sponsorship; it is not only the matter of material, worldly interests. Indeed, these (religious and educational interests) are more important, just as a father’s educating and disciplining his children is more important than his simply spending on them. Shaykh Ibn Sa’di said – concerning a man educating his children: When you feed them, clothe them and train them physically, you are fulfilling their rights for which you will be rewarded; by the same token, when you train them spiritually and impart beneficial knowledge to them, and guide them towards good morals and manners and warn them against the opposite, you are also fulfilling rights which are even more important.” Bahjat Quloob al-Abrar, 128. 
This is the true sponsorship of an orphan, bringing him up like one's own son, which is not limited to feeling compassion for him and being kind to him, and teaching him and disciplining him and educating him in the best manner. Fayd al-Qadeer by al-Manaawi, 1/108. 
Al-‘Iraaqi (may Allah have mercy on him) wondered whether this was the reason why the one who sponsors an orphan would be close to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in Paradise. He said: “Perhaps the reason why the one who sponsors an orphan will be so close to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in Paradise is because a Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is usually sent to people who do not know about Allah and the true religion, so a Prophet is like a sponsor, teacher and guide for them, and the one who sponsors an orphan is taking care of one who does not understand his religion, or even his worldly affairs, so he guides him, teaches him and disciplines him. (Quoted by al-Haafiz in al-Fath, 10/437. 
Moreover, limiting it to spending, especially when the orphan is far away, deprives the sponsor of one of the means of softening the heart and meeting needs, which is embracing the orphan and treating him kindly. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Bring the orphan close to you, wipe his head and give him some of your food, for that will soften your heart and fulfil your need.” Al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 854. 
The point is that the best way of sponsoring an orphan is for a man to bring him in with his own children, and raise him as he raises them, and spend on him as he spends on them. 
If the sponsor cannot afford to spend on the orphan, or if the orphan has enough wealth to be independent of means, and a man brings him in with his own children, this is good, even if it is lower in status than the first suggestion. This is one of the greatest types of sponsorship, and serves one of its greatest aims. Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “This virtue is attained by the one who sponsors an orphan from his own wealth or from the orphan’s wealth under legitimate shar’i guardianship. Quoted by Ibn ‘Alaan in Daleel al-Faaliheen, 3/104. 
If a man has wealth from which he can spend on an orphan, as in the case of the person asking this question, then he is doing something very good in sha Allah, and it will be sufficient to protect him from the fitnah (trial, temptation) of wealth and stinginess. And it will fulfill the condition stipulated by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “… from which he gives to the poor, the orphan and the wayfarer.” But this is not sponsorship in the fullest sense, for which a person is promised closeness to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in Paradise. But if he has a pure and sincere intention he may achieve thereby that which he could not attain by his deeds. It was narrated from Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was on a campaign and he said: “There are people whom we have left behind in Madeenah, but we did not travel though any mountain pass or valley but they were with us. They were detained by some excuse.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2839.",Islam Q&A
47196,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47196,She had injections to make her infertile – what is the ruling on that?,"There is a woman who has been married for 20 years. All these years she has not been keen to have children because she is afraid of getting pregnant, after she miscarried during her first pregnancy. She used contraceptive pills during this time but Allah decreed that she could not prevent pregnancy altogether. She has three children, all of whom were born by caesarian section. After the last child she went to the doctor who gave her injections which made her completely infertile. Now she regrets what she did and is asking whether she has to do anything. She says that her husband knows about that; what does she have to do besides repenting?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Islam encourages us to have many children, and the Prophet of Allah Shu’ayb (peace be upon him) reminded (his people) of this blessing and said to them: “And remember when you were but few, and He multiplied you” [al-A’raaf 7:86]. And it was narrated from Ma’qil ibn Yasaar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Marry those who are loving and fertile, for I will be proud of your great numbers before the nations.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2050; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani. See also question no. 13492. 
Being sterilized permanently may mean one of two things: 
1 – It may be done out of necessity, such as if it is determined by trustworthy medicinal evidence that pregnancy will pose a danger to the mother’s life, and there is no hope of a cure, so permanent sterilization will ward off that danger. In this case it is permissible to be sterilized. 
2 – When there is no need for it. Undoubtedly in this case it is a criminal act and a major sin, because it is a transgression against the creation of Allah for no reason, and preventing the production of offspring which was encouraged by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and being ungrateful for the blessing of children which Allah bestows upon His creation. 
It says in al-Insaaf: It says in al-Faa’iq: And it is not permissible to do anything that will put a stop to pregnancy. (1/383). 
The Islamic Fiqh Council stated the following in its report no. 39 (1/5): 
It is haraam to sterilize both men and women, if there is no necessary reason for doing so unless there is a necessity which is to be determined according to the guidelines set out by sharee’ah. It is permissible to take temporary measures to space pregnancies or prevent them for a limited period of time, if there is a legitimate shar’i need to do so, so long as this decision is made on the basis of mutual consultation and approval between the spouses. That is subject to the condition that no harm should result from that, and that the means should be acceptable according to sharee’ah, and that there should be no harm caused to an existing pregnancy. End quote. 
Based on this, if your preventing pregnancy is for a legitimate reason as outlined above, then you do not have to do anything. But if it was not for a necessary reason, then you have done something which is haraam, and you have to repent sincerely to Allah and stop taking these injections immediately. If there is anything that will reverse their effect without causing harm, then you must take it.
And Allah knows best.",Islam Q&A
