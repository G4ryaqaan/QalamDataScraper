it permissible to use if it is being applied to the skin only?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
If the medicine containing alcohol is essentially an intoxicant, such that drinking a large amount 
of it would make one drunk, then it is haraam to take it or to give it, because the Prophet 
SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""Whatever makes one drunk in large 
amounts, a little of it is haraam"" (Reported by the four muhadditheen and others; see also Saheeh al-Jaami’, 
no. 5530). If it is not an intoxicant, then it is permitted to give it and to apply it to the skin, etc.

604,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/604,Justification for following the Sunnah,"Why do we have to follow the sunnah of the prophet Muhammad and not just follow the quran ?
Why do we have to follow a specific Mathab?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The first question may appear strange and somewhat surprising to committed, practising Muslims. How can something which is so obviously one of the bases of Islaam become a matter for discussion and debate? But since the question has been asked, we will present, with the help of Allah, the principles and bases of the importance of the Sunnah, the obligation to follow it and the ruling concerning those who reject it. By so doing, we will also refute the doubters and the misguided group who call themselves “Quraniyyeen” (the Quran has nothing to do with them!) In sha Allah this discussion will be of benefit to everyone who wants to understand the truth of the matter.
Proof of the importance of the Sunnah
(1) The Quran speaks of the importance of the Sunnah, for example:
(a) Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “He who obeys the Messenger has indeed obeyed Allah . . .” [al-Nisaa’ 4:80] Allah described obedience to the Prophet (peace be upon him) as being a part of obedience to Him. Then He made a connection between obedience to Him and obedience to the Prophet (peace be upon him): “O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger . . .” [al-Nisaa’ 4:59]
(b) Allah warns us not to go against the Prophet (peace be upon him), and states that whoever disobeys him will be doomed to eternal Hell. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “. . . And let those who oppose the Messenger’s commandment beware, lest some fitnah (trial, affliction, etc.) befall them or a painful torment be inflicted on them.” [al-Nur 24:63]
(c) Allah has made obedience to His Prophet a religious duty; resisting or opposing it is a sign of hypocrisy: “”But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you [Muhammad] judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission.” [al-Nisaa’ 4:65]
(d) Allah commands His slaves to respond to Him and His Messenger: “O you who believe! Answer Allah (by obeying Him) and (His) Messenger when he calls you to that which will give you life . . .” [al-Anfaal 8:24]
(e) Allah also commands His slaves to refer all disputes to him: “. . . (And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allah and His Messenger . . .” [al-Nisaa’ 4:59]
(2) The Sunnah itself indicates the importance of the Sunnah. For example:
(a) Al-Tirmidhi reported from Abu Raafi’ and others that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “I do not want to see any one of you reclining on his couch and, when he hears of my instructions or prohibitions, saying ‘I don’t accept it; we didn’t find any such thing in the Book of Allah.’” Abu ‘Eesaa said: This is a saheeh hasan hadeeth. (See Sunan al-Tirmidhi, Shaakir edition, no. 2663).
Al-’Irbaad ibn Saariyah, may Allah be pleased with him, reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “Would any of you think, reclining on his couch, that Allah would only describe what is forbidden in the Quran? I tell you, by Allah, that I have warned and commanded and prohibited things that are as important as what is in the Quran, if not more so.” (Reported by Abu Dawud, Kitaab al-Khiraj wa’l-imaarah wa’l-fay’).
(b) Abu Dawud also reported from al-’Irbaad ibn Saariyah, may Allah be pleased with him, that “the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) led us in prayer one day, then he turned to us and exhorted us strongly . . . (he said), ‘Pay attention to my sunnah (way) and the way of the Rightly-guided Khaleefahs after me, adhere to it and hold fast to it.’” (Saheeh Abi Dawud, Kitaab al-Sunnah).
(3) The scholars’ consensus (ijmaa’) affirming the importance of the Sunnah.
Al-Shaafi’i, may Allah have mercy on him, said: “I do not know of anyone among the Sahaabah and Taabi’een who narrated a report from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) without accepting it, adhering to it and affirming that this was sunnah. Those who came after the Taabi’een, and those whom we met did likewise: they all accepted the reports and took them to be sunnah, praising those who followed them and criticizing those who went against them. Whoever deviated from this path would be regarded by us as having deviated from the way of the Companions of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and the scholars who followed them, and would be considered as one of the ignorant.
(4) Common sense indicates the importance of the Sunnah.
The fact that the Prophet (peace be upon him) is the Messenger of Allah indicates that we must believe everything he said and obey every command he gave. It goes without saying that he has told us things and given instructions in addition to what is in the Quran. It is futile to make a distinction between the Sunnah and the Quran when it comes to adhering to it and responding to it. It is obligatory to believe in what he has told us, and to obey his instructions.
The ruling concerning those who deny the importance of the Sunnah is that they are kaafirs, because they deny and reject a well-known and undeniable part of the religion.
As regards your second question, about whether a Muslim is required to follow a particular madhhab, the answer is that he does not have to. For the average “rank and file” Muslim, his madhhab is that of his mufti or the scholar whom he consults for religious verdicts; he must ask those pious scholars whom he trusts for opinions when necessary. If a person has enough knowledge to distinguish which evidence and opinion is stronger, then he must follow the scholarly opinion which has the strongest support from the Quran and Sunnah. It is acceptable for a Muslim to follow one of the four well-known madhhabs, on the condition that he understands that the truth in any given issue may lie with another madhhab, in which case he must ignore his own madhhab’s opinion and follow the truth. The Muslim’s aim is to follow the truth that is in accordance with the Quran and Sunnah. The madhhabs of fiqh are only a means of reaching ahkaam (rules) based on the Quran and Sunnah, they are not Quran and Sunnah.
We ask Allah to show us the truth and help us to follow it, and to show us falsehood and help us to avoid it. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

606,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/606,Why Does Allah Refer to Himself as ‘We’?,"Why does the Quran use the term ""We"" when referring to Allah in its verses? Many non-believers believe that this may be in reference to Jesus?","1- It is a feature of literary style in Arabic that a person may refer to himself by the pronoun nahnu, ‘We’, for respect or glorification. 
2- He may also use the word ana, ‘I’, indicating one person, or the third person huwa, ‘He’. All three styles are used in the Quran, where Allah addresses the Arabs in their own tongue.",,"Praise be to Allah.It is a feature of literary style in Arabic that a person may refer to himself by the pronoun nahnu, ‘We’, for respect or glorification. He may also use the word ana, ‘I’, indicating one person, or the third person huwa, ‘He’ . All three styles are used in the Quran , where Allah addresses the Arabs in their own tongue. (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 4/143)
“Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, sometimes refers to Himself in the singular, by name or by use of a pronoun, and sometimes by use of the plural, as in the phrase (interpretation of the meaning): ‘Verily, We have given you a manifest victory” [Al-Fath 48:1], and other similar phrases. But Allah never refers to Himself by use of the dual, because the plural refers to the respect that He deserves, and may refer to His names and attributes, whereas the dual refers to a specific number (and nothing else), and He is far above that.” (Al-‘Aqidah al-Tadmuriyyah by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah, p. 75)
These words, inna (“Verily We”) and nahnu (“We”), and other forms of the plural, may be used by one person speaking on behalf of a group, or they may be used by one person for purposes of respect or glorification, as is done by some monarchs when they issue statements or decrees in which they say “We have decided…” etc. [This is known in English as “The Royal We” – Translator].
In such cases, only one person is speaking but the plural is used for respect. The One Who is more deserving of respect than any other is Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, so when He says in the Quran inna (“Verily We”) and nahnu (“We”), it is for respect and glorification, not to indicate plurality of numbers. If a verse of this type is causing confusion, it is essential to refer to the clear, unambiguous verses for clarification. 
If a Christian, for example, insists on taking verses such as “Verily, We: it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e., the Quran)” [al-Hijr 15:9 – interpretation of the meaning] as proof of divine plurality, we may refute this claim by quoting such clear and unambiguous verses as (interpretation of the meanings): “And your god is One God, there is none who has the right to be worshipped but He, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful” [al-Baqarah 2:163] and “Say: He is Allah, the One” [al-Ikhlas 112:1] – and other verses which can only be interpreted in one way. 
Thus confusion will be dispelled for the one who is seeking the truth. Every time Allah uses the plural to refer to Himself, it is based on the respect and honour that He deserves, and on the great number of His names and attributes, and on the great number of His troops and angels.” (See Al-‘Aqidah al-Tadmuriyyah by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah, p. 109)

608,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/608,What Will Women Get in Jannah?,"I am a firm believer in the Quran and Allah. Thank Allah my faith and trust in Him grows each day. My concern is this: the Quran mentions over and over the blessings of Heaven. It repeatedly mentions beautiful, pure maidens as a bounty of Heaven. People often say Islam is a male dominance religion.
Why is there no mention of rewards for women?","Allah promised those who do good deeds, be they men or women, if they believe in Allah and His Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him), that He will make them live a good life in this world and they will be rewarded in the Hereafter.","All address to men in the Quran is address to women


What will women get in Jannah?","Praise be to Allah.All address to men in the Quran is address to women
Since you believe in Allah and His Book, you must know that {and not one will thy Lord treat with injustice}, Verse 49, Surat al-Kahf, or the Cave, and {Allah is never unjust in the least degree: if there is any good (done), He doubles it, and gives from His Own Self a great reward}, Verse 40, Surat an-Nisa, or the Women. (Translation of the meanings)
Allah has meant this Law of Islam (Shari'ah) for both men and women. All address to men in the Quran is address to women as well, and all rules affecting men affect women as well unless evidence is established that one of them is meant and not the other as in the rules relating to Jihad (fighting for Islam), menstruation, custodianship, rule etc.
The evidence that women are included in Verses of the Quran in the male gender is a Hadith by ‘Aishah who said that the Prophet (may peace and blessings be upon him) was asked about a man who sees traces of semen but does not remember having any dream of a sexual nature. The Prophet (may peace and blessings be upon him) said: ""Such a man should perform the Ghusl (ritual bath).”
He was also asked of a man who remembers a dream of a sexual nature but sees no traces of semen. He said: ""Such a man does not have to perform the Ghusl (ritual bath). Umm Salim said ""A woman may have the same experience. Does she have to perform the Ghusl (ritual bath)?"" The Prophet (may peace and blessings be upon him) said: ""Yes, there is no difference in this between man and woman."" (Narrated by Abu Dawud, at-Tirmidhi 113 and others. The last phrase is in Sahih al-Jami’ under No. 2333)
What will women get in Jannah?
With respect to rewards in the Hereafter and what women have in Heaven , we include a number of Verses and Hadiths as follows:
Umm Salamah said: ""O Messenger of Allah. I did not hear a Verse in the Quran regarding the Hijrah (migration with the Prophet) of women."" Then was revealed the Verse: {And their Lord has accepted of them, and answered them: Never will I suffer to be lost the work of any of you, be he male or female: ye are members, one of another: those who have left their homes, and were driven out therefrom, and suffered harm in My cause, and fought and were slain, verily I will blot out from them their inequities, and admit them into gardens with rivers flowing beneath; ... A reward from Allah, and from Allah is the best of rewards.}, Verse 195, Surat al-Imran, or the Family (translation of the meaning). The Hadith was narrated by at-Tirmidhi under No. 3023.
Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said the Verse {fastajaba lahum rabbuhum} means Allah replied to their queries ... and the Verse {anni la udi’u ‘amala ‘amilin minkum min thakarin aw untha} is an explanation of the reply meaning that good deeds will not be lost or ignored. All men and women will have the just reward for their deeds. The Verse {ba’dukum min ba’d} means you will be treated equally with respect to rewards .
{If any do deeds of righteousness, be they male or female, and have faith, they will enter Heaven, and not the least injustice will be done to them.}, Verse 124, Surat an-Nisa, or the Women (translation of the meaning).
In explanation of this Verse, Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said the Verse shows Allah’s kindness, generosity and mercy in accepting the good deeds of all people, men and women, provided that they believe, in allowing them into Heaven and in not decreasing rewards for their good deeds, not even in the least.
{Whoever works righteousness, man or woman, and has faith, verily, to him will we give a life that is good and pure, and we will bestow on such their reward according to the best of actions.}, Verse 97, Surat an-Nahl, or the Bees (translation of the meaning).
Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said this is a promise by Allah, the Exalted, to those who do good deeds i.e. deeds acceptable to Allah in which a Muslim follows the rules set in the Book of Allah, the Exalted, and the Sunnah of His Prophet (may peace and blessings be upon him), be they men or women, if they believe in Allah and His Messenger (may peace and blessings be upon him), that He will make them live a good life in this world and will be rewarded in the Hereafter. A good life would include all types of comfort.
{He that makes evil will not be requited but by the like thereof; and he that makes a righteous deed whether man or woman and is a believer, such will enter the garden (of bliss): therein will they have abundance without measure.}, Verse 40, Surat al-Muminun, or the believers (translation of the meaning).
Finally; Dear Sister, here is a Hadith that will dispel any doubt you may have with respect to the mentioning of women:
Umm Umarah al-Ansariyyah said that she went to the Prophet (may peace and blessings be upon him) and said to Him: ""I feel that everything is for men. Women are not mentioned as having anything. Then was revealed the Verse (translation of the meaning): {For Muslim men and women, for believing men and women etc}, Verse 35, Surat al-Ahzab, or the Confederates. The Hadith is narrated by at-Tirmidhi under No. 3211, and is in Sahih at-Tirmidhi under No. 2565.
In the collection of Hadiths of Imam Ahmad was narrated the Hadith that Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: ""I said ""O Messenger (may peace and blessings be upon him) of Allah. Why aren’t we mentioned in the Quran in an equal footing with men?"" Then; I was surprised to hear Him call one day from the pulpit: ""O people."" As I was combing my hair at the moment, I wrapped it up and came close to the door and stood there listening to him say: ""Allah, Mighty and Sublime be He, revealed that (in meaning) {For Muslim men and women; for believing men and women; for devout men and women, for true men and women; for men and women who are patient and constant; for men and women who humble themselves; for men and women who give in charity; for men and women who fast; for men and women who guard their chastity; and for men and women who engage much in Allah's remembrance, for them has Allah prepared forgiveness and great reward.} Verse 35, Surat al-Ahzab, or the Confederates.
We ask Allah to give us all the ability to show sincerity in words and deeds and to continue as well-established Muslims.

  I went and sat with Abu Hurayrah and said: I asked Allaah to bless me

  prayers. Then all his deeds will be examined and dealt with in the same 
  way. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, no. 413; see

  met Abu Hurayrah. He said: He asked me about my lineage so I told him 
  about it, then he said: O young man, shall I not tell you a hadeeth? 
  I said, Of course, may Allaah have mercy on you, and I think he 
  mentioned it from the Prophet  (peace and blessings

  about on the Day of Resurrection will be their prayers. Our Lord will say to 
  His angels (although He knows best): Look at My slaves prayers: 
  are they complete or is something lacking? If they are complete, they 
  will be recorded as such, but if something is lacking, He will say: Look 
  and see if My slave has any voluntary prayers to his credit. If this proves

Thus the texts issue stern warnings to those who claim to belong to anyone other than their fathers. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Whoever claims to belong to anyone other than his father on him will be the curse of Allaah and the angels and all the people.
(Reported by Ibn Maajah, 2599; Saheeh al-Jaami, 6104). This action is also a major sin comprised of two major sins, lying in order to consume wealth unlawfully and claiming to belong to someone other than one's father.
This person has to go back to what is true, and give up the nationality he aquired improperly. He should go back to using his proper documents that prove his real lineage. This is obligatory upon him. I am astounded that anyone would do such a thing for worldly gains. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
Whoever wishes for the quick-passing (transitory enjoyment of this world), We readily grant him what We will for whome We like. Then, afterwards, We have appointed for him Hell, he will burn therein disgraced and rejected, (- far away from Allaahs Mercy). [al-Isra 17:18]
The one who does this had to repent to Allaah, and Allaah has forgiven what is past [al-Maaidah 5:95 interpretation of the meaning]. With regard to whatever money he has taken as a result of having that nationality, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) So whoever receives an admonition from his Lord and stops eating riba [usury] shall not be punished for the past [al-Baqarah 2:275]. This aayah is speaking about the one who consumes riba (interest or usury), so it applies even more in the case of lesser sins. And Allaah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

What is the legal ruling of men wearing jewelery that is 18k gold ""electroplated"" such as watches, belts, rings, etc.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Wearing gold is haraam for men.
‘Abdullah ibn ‘Abbaas reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw a gold ring on a man’s hand. He took it off and threw it aside, saying, ""Would any of you take a burning coal and hold it in his hand?"" When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had gone away, someone said to the man, ""Take your ring and benefit from it (i.e., sell it)."" He said, ""No, by Allah, I will not take it after the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has thrown it away."" (reported by Muslim, no. 2090).
‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr ibn al’Aas reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""Whoever of my ummah wears gold and dies wearing it, Allah will deny him the gold of Paradise. Whoever of my ummah wears silk and dies wearing it, Allah will deny him the silk of Paradise."" (Reported by Imam Ahmad).
This prohibition applies to men only, not to women, as ‘Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, reported that the Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) took a piece of silk in his right hand and a piece of gold in his left, and said: ""These are forbidden for the males of my ummah."" (reported by al-Nisaa’i and Abu Dawud).
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) also said: ""Wearing silk and gold is permitted for the women of my ummah and prohibited for the males."" (Reported by Imam Ahmad)
Gold is permitted for women because of their delicate and gentle nature, and their need for adornment. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""(Do they then like for Allah) a creature who is brought up in adornments (wearing gold and silk ornaments, i.e., women), and in dispute cannot make herself clear?"" [al-Zukhruf 43:18]
As for men, it is a sign of instability and an unmasculine nature to adorn oneself with gold. Islaam wants the differences between the sexes to be marked clearly, and their distinct characteristics to stand out, because when they resemble one another, much corruption results therefrom. The prohibition of gold for men includes pure gold, gold alloys, cut pieces, joined pieces, gold inlay, etc. As for gold-plating and gilding, some scholars are of the opinion that such articles are forbidden for men if it is possible to extract gold from them (by peeling or shaving off, for example); if no gold can be extracted from it, then such items are permitted. Some scholars say that it is not permitted to wear an item which is wholly or mostly gold-plated, but if only a little part of it is gold-plated (like the hands of a watch, or the numerals, or the tiny points denoting numbers), then it is permitted to wear it. They say that the issue is its appearance, not its value: if the gold-plating is very obvious and covers everything, it is not permitted, because many people will not make the distinction between gold-plate and real gold, and some may follow this person’s example and begin to wear pure gold.

Du`a (Supplication)","Praise be to Allah.How to control anger
Anger is one of the evil whispers of Shaytan, which leads to so many evils and tragedies, of which only Allah knows their full extent. For this reason Islam has a great deal to say about this bad characteristic, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) described cures for this ""disease"" and ways to limit its effects, among which are the following:
Seeking refuge with Allah from the Shaytan
Sulayman ibn Sard said: ""I was sitting with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and two men were slandering one another. One of them was red in the face, and the veins on his neck were standing out. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ‘I know a word which, if he were to say it, what he feels would go away. If he said ""I seek refuge with Allah from the Shaytan,"" what he feels (i.e., his anger) would go away.’"" (Reported by al-Bukhari, al-Fath, 6/337)

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""If a man gets angry and says, ‘I seek refuge with Allah ,’ his anger will go away."" (Sahih al-Jami’ al-Saghir, no. 695)
Keeping silent
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""If any of you becomes angry, let him keep silent."" (Reported by Imam Ahmad, al-Musnad, 1/329; see also Sahih al-Jami’, 693, 4027)

This is because, in most cases, the angry person loses self-control and could utter words of kufr/disbelief (from which we seek refuge with Allah), or curses, or the word of divorce (talaq) which would destroy his home, or words of slander which would bring him the enmity and hatred of others. So, in short, keeping silent is the solution which helps one to avoid all that.
Not moving
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""If any of you becomes angry and he is standing, let him sit down, so his anger will go away; if it does not go away, let him lie down.""

The narrator of this hadith is Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him), and there is a story connected to his telling of it: he was taking his camels to drink at a trough that he owned, when some other people came along and said (to one another), ""Who can compete with Abu Dharr (in bringing animals to drink) and make his hair stand on end?"" A man said, ""I can,"" so he brought his animals and competed with Abu Dharr, with the result that the trough was broken. [i.e., Abu Dharr was expecting help in watering his camels, but instead the man misbehaved and caused the trough to be broken]. Abu Dharr was standing, so he sat down, then he laid down. Someone asked him, ""O Abu Dharr, why did you sit down then lie down?"" He said: ""The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: . . ."" and quoted the hadith. (The hadith and this story may be found in Musnad Ahmad, 5/152; see also Sahih al-Jami’, no. 694).

According to another report, Abu Dharr was watering his animals at the trough, when another man made him angry, so he sat down . . . (Fayd al-Qadir, al-Manawi, 1/408)

Among the benefits of this advice given by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the fact that it prevents the angry person from going out of control, because he could strike out and injure someone, or even kill - as we will find out shortly - or he could destroy possessions and so on. Sitting down makes it less likely that one will become overexcited. Lying down makes it even less likely that he will do something crazy or harmful.
Al-’Allamah al-Khattabi, may Allah have mercy on him, said in his commentary on Abu Dawud:
""One who is standing is in a position to strike and destroy, while the one who is sitting is less likely to do that, and the one who is lying down can do neither. It is possible that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told the angry person to sit down or lie down so that he would not do something that he would later regret. And Allah knows best."" (Sunan Abi Dawud, with Ma'alim al-Sunan, 5/141)
Following the advice of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)
Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, reported that a man said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), ""Advise me."" He said, ""Do not become angry."" The man repeated his request several times, and each time the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told him, ""Do not become angry."" (Reported by al-Bukhari, Fath al-Bari, 10/456)

According to another report, the man said: ""I thought about what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, and I realized that anger combines all kinds of evil."" (Musnad Ahmad, 5/373)
Do not become angry and Paradise will be yours 
This is an authentic hadith. (See Sahih al-Jami’, 7374. Ibn Hijr attributed it to al-Tabarani, see al-Fath 4/465)
Remembering what Allah has promised to the righteous (muttaqin) who keep away from the causes of anger and struggle within themselves to control it, is one of the most effective ways of extinguishing the flames of anger. One of the hadiths that describe the great reward for doing this is: ""Whoever controls his anger at the time when he has the means to act upon it, Allah will fill his heart with contentment on the Day of Resurrection."" (Reported by al-Tabarani, 12/453, see also Sahih al-Jami’, 6518).

Another great reward is described in the Prophet’s words: ""Whoever controls his anger at the time when he has the means to act upon it, Allah will call him before all of mankind on the Day of Resurrection, and will let him choose of the Hur al-’Iyn whoever he wants."" (Reported by Abu Dawud, 4777, and others. It is classified as hasan (sound) in Sahih al-Jami’, 6518)
Knowing the high status and advantages offered to those who control themselves
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""The strong man is not the one who can overpower others (in wrestling); rather, the strong man is the one who controls himself when he gets angry."" (Reported by Ahmad, 2/236; the hadith is agreed upon). 
The greater the anger, the higher the status of the one who controls himself. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""The strongest man is the one who, when he gets angry and his face reddens and his hackles rise, is able to defeat his anger."" (Reported by Imam Ahmad, 5/367, and classified as hasan in Sahih al-Jami’, 3859)

Anas reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) passed by some people who were wrestling. He asked, ""What is this?"" They said: ""So-and-So is the strongest, he can beat anybody."" The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ""Shall I not tell you who is even stronger than him? The man who, when he is mistreated by another, controls his anger, has defeated his own shaytan and the shaytan of the one who made him angry."" (Reported by al-Bazzar, and Ibn Hijr said its isnad is sahih. Al-Fath, 10/519)
Following the Prophet’s example in the case of anger
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is our leader and has set the highest example in this matter, as is recorded in a number of hadiths. One of the most famous was reported by Anas, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: ""I was walking with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and he was wearing a Najrani cloak with a rough collar. A Bedouin came and seized him roughly by the edge of his cloak, and I saw the marks left on his neck by the collar. Then the Bedouin ordered him to give him some of the wealth of Allah that he had. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) turned to him and smiled, then ordered that he should be given something."" (Agreed upon. Fath al-Bari, 10/375)

Another way in which we can follow the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is by making our anger for the sake of Allah, when His rights are violated. This is the kind of anger which is praiseworthy. So the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) became angry when he was told about the imam who was putting people off the prayer by making it too long; when he saw a curtain with pictures of animate creatures in ‘Aishah’s house; when Usamah spoke to him about the Makhzumi woman who had been convicted of theft, and he said ""Do you seek to intervene concerning one of the punishments prescribed by Allah?""; when he was asked questions that he disliked, and so on. His anger was purely for the sake of Allah.
Knowing that resisting anger is one of the signs of righteousness
The righteous (al-muttaqun) are those praised by Allah in the Quran and by His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Paradise as wide as heaven and earth has been prepared for them. One of their characteristics is that they (interpretation of the meaning) ""spend (in Allah’s Cause) in prosperity and in adversity, [they] repress anger, and [they] pardon men; verily, Allah loves al-muhsinun (the good-doers)."" [Al ‘Imran 3:134]

These are the ones whose good character and beautiful attributes and deeds Allah has mentioned, and whom people admire and want to emulate. One of their characteristics is that (interpretation of the meaning) "". . . when they are angry, they forgive."" [al-Shura 42:37]
Listening to reminders
Anger is a part of human nature, and people vary in their anger. It may be difficult for a man not to get angry, but sincere people will remember Allah when they are reminded, and they will not overstep the mark. Some examples follow:

Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that a man sought permission to speak to ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him), then he said: ""O son of al-Khattab, you are not giving us much and you are not judging fairly between us."" ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) was so angry that he was about to attack the man, but al-Hurr ibn Qays, who was one of those present, said: ""O Amir al-Mu’minin, Allah said to His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) (interpretation of the meaning): ‘Show forgiveness, enjoin what is good, and turn away from the foolish’ [al-A’raf 7:199]. This man is one of the foolish."" By Allah, ‘Umar could go no further after al-Hurr had recited this ayah to him, and he was a man who was careful to adhere to the Book of Allah. (Reported by al-Bukhari, al-Fath, 4/304)

This is how the Muslim should be. The evil hypocrite was not like this when he was told the hadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and one of the Companions said to him, ""Seek refuge with Allah from the Shaytan."" He said to the one who reminded him, ""Do you think I am crazy? Go away!"" (Reported by al-Bukhari, al-Fath, 1/465). We seek refuge with Allah from failure.
Knowing the bad effects of anger
The negative effects of anger are many; in short they cause damage to one’s own self and to others. The angry person may utter words of slander and obscenity, he may attack others (physically) in an uncontrolled manner, even to the point of killing. The following story contains a valuable lesson:

`Alqamah ibn Wail reported that his father (may Allah be pleased with him) told him: ""I was sitting with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when a man came to him leading another man by a rope. He said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, this man killed my brother.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked him, ‘Did you kill him?’ He said, ‘Yes, I killed him.’ He asked, ‘How did you kill him?’ He said, ‘He and I were hitting a tree to make the leaves fall, for animal feed, and he slandered me, so I struck him on the side of the head with an axe, and killed him.’ . . ."" (Reported by Muslim, 1307, edited by al-Baqi)

Anger could lead to less than killing, such as wounding and breaking bones. If the one who caused the anger runs away, the angry person turns his anger on himself, so he may tear his clothes, or strike his cheeks, or have a fit, or fall unconscious, or he may break dishes and plates, or break furniture.

In the worst cases, anger results in social disasters and the breaking of family ties, i.e., divorce. Ask many of those who divorced their wives, and they will tell you: it was in a moment of anger. This divorce results in misery for the children, regret and frustration, a hard and difficult life, all as a result of anger. If they had remembered Allah, come to their senses, restrained their anger and sought refuge with Allah, none of this would have happened. Going against the shari’ah (Islamic law) only results in loss.

The damage to health that results from anger can only be described by doctors, such as thrombosis, high blood pressure, tachycardia (abnormally rapid heartbeat) and hyperventilation (rapid, shallow breathing), which can lead to fatal heart attacks, diabetes, etc. We ask Allah for good health.
The angry person should think about himself during moments of anger
If the angry person could see himself in the mirror when he is angry, he would hate himself and the way he looks. If he could see the way he changes, and the way his body and limbs shake, how his eyes glare and how out of control and crazy his behaviour is, he would despise himself and be revolted by his own appearance. It is well-known that inner ugliness is even worse than outer ugliness; how happy the Shaytan must be when a person is in this state! We seek refuge with Allah from the Shaytan and from failure.
Du`a (Supplication)
Du`a is always the weapon of the believer, whereby he asks Allah to protect him from evil, trouble and bad behaviour and seeks refuge with Him from falling into the pit of kufr (disbelief) or wrongdoing because of anger. One of the three things that can help save him is: being fair at times of contentment and of anger (Sahih al-Jami’, 3039). One of the Du`as of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was:

""O Allah, by Your knowledge of the Unseen and Your power over Your creation, keep me alive for as long as You know life is good for me, and cause me to die when You know death is good for me. O Allah, I ask You to make me fear You in secret and in public, and I ask You to make me speak the truth in times of contentment and of anger. I ask You not to let me be extravagant in poverty or in prosperity. I ask You for continuous blessings, and for contentment that does not end. I ask You to let me accept Your decree, and for a good life after death. I ask You for the joy of seeing Your face and for the longing to meet You, without going through diseases and misguiding fitnah (trials). O Allah, adorn us with the adornment of faith and make us among those who are guided. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.""

      this card? Me because I gat it for him Or Him because he asked for it .

the options that I have. 
I thank you tremendously for you time.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Al-hamdu lillaah
You have two options;
Your first option is: The woman must be a chaste kitaabiyya (be among people of the 
book, i.e. Christian or Jewish), and in that case you can marry her following what 
Allaah said (interpretation of the meaning):
""and chaste women among the believers and chaste women among those who were 
given the Scripture (Jews and Christians)"" Al-Maidah 4:5.
The second option you have is that she converts to Islam and then you marry her.
Otherwise, remember the hell fire, and remember what Allaah said in the Quraan 
(interpretation of the meaning): 
""And do not marry Al-Mushrikat ( idolatresses, etc.) until they believe ( worship Allaah 
alone). And indeed a slave woman who believes is better than a (free) Mushrikah 
(idolatress, etc.) even though she pleases you. And give not your daughters in 
marriage to Al-Mushrikoon until they believe (in Allaah alone) and verily, a believing 
slave is better than a (free) Mushrik ( idolater, etc.), even though he pleases you. They 
(Al-Mushrikoon) invite you to the Fire, but Allaah invites (you) to Paradise and 
Forgiveness by His leave, and makes His aayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, 
signs, revelations) clear to mankind so that they may remember "". Al-Baqarah, verse 
#2:221 
The meaning of ""a slave woman who believes is better than a non-believer"" is simply 
that she is better than a non-believer who is (free) even if the non-believer pleases you, 
even if she pleases you, EVEN IF SHE PLEASES YOU!

673,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/673,Calling aathaan inside the masjid or prayer room,"Is it against the Sunnah to call the adhan inside the Musallah? I believe the 
way of the Salaf is to call it from the tallest structure/house near the masjid or 
the masjid itself.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Al-hamdu lillaah.
There is absolutely nothing wrong with calling the athaan in the musallah; on the 
contrary, it is better than abandoning it altogether. Prophet Muhammad  (peace be 
upon him) taught two men who were traveling how to make the call for prayer while 
traveling, where no mosques or musallahs may be found. As was narrated in the 
hadeeth saheah by Malik Ibn Al-Huwayrith: ""My cousin and I came to the Prophet 
SAWS and he said to us, ‘If you travel, (meaning while you are traveling) perform the 
call for prayer, and call the iqamah before prayer and let the older one of you be the 
Imam."" Narrated by Al Bukhari, Fath ul-Baari hadeeth #658 and Al Tirmidhi, hadeeth 
#189. According to Abu Eissa (Al Tirmidhi) this hadeeth is hasan saheeh. There were 
two views on the hadeeth. The majority of the Muslim scholars agreed on the validity of 
calling the aathaan while traveling. Others however, have said that the iqamah alone is 
sufficient, and that the purpose of the aathaan is to gather people for prayer. According 
to Ahmad and Ishaaq, the first view is more sound. 
In another Hadeeth narrated by ‘Ukbah bin ‘Aamir he said: I heard the Prophet  say, 
""Allaah is pleased by a shepherd who, while on the top of a mountain, calls for prayer 
and prays. Allaah the Almighty says, ‘Look at my worshipperhe calls the aathaan, 
and he prays; he fears me. I have forgiven my worshipper, and I have sent him to 
heaven ( meaning that Allah chose for this person to go to heaven).’"" Narrated by 
Al-Nisaa’i, Abu Dawood, and Ahmad and was confirmed sound by Al Albany in his 
book Saheeh Al-Jami’, Hadeeth #8102.
The benefits of the aathaan are many and they are by no means limited to gathering 
people, or announcing prayer time. They encompass: repelling Satan, getting rewarded 
in the afterlife for calling for prayer, and furthermore, for announcing and repeating the 
oneness of Allaah, etc.

right to prevent him from getting married for the reason stated in the question. Allaah 
is the Provider and those brothers and sisters are part of His creation; He will never

himself chaste. He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
""And marry those among you who are single (i.e. a man who has no wife and a 
woman who has no husband) and (also marry) the saalihoon (pious, fit and 
capable ones) of your (male) slaves and maid-servants (female slaves). If they be 
poor, Allaah will enrich them out of His Bounty. And Allaah is All-Sufficient for His

695,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/695,"Can one celebrate completing the
Qur’aan?","A young girl has finished reading the Qur’aan for
  the first time, and wants to invite her friends for a celebration on this occasion. What
  should she write on the invitation cards?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
This is a wonderful thing for such a young person (11 years old) living in a non-Muslim
country and deviant society to accomplish. The fact that she has not given her name is a
sign of sincerity, in sha Allaah. I think that this should only be announced for the
purposes of encouraging others to do the same. The affair should be limited to a small
gathering where some relatives or friends invite a few of the girl’s friends, tell
them of her achievement in completing the Qur’aan in order to encourage them - not to
show off or boast - and some of the mothers say a few words about the greatness of the
Qur’aan, the importance of reading it and how the Muslim should treat the
Qur’aan. Or this girl could invite her friends to a meal to mark the occasion and
give thanks for this blessing. There is nothing wrong with such activities, as long as one
is careful not to let it turn into a celebration. 
It is clear from the above that celebrating a person’s completion of reciting or
memorizing the Qur’aan, inviting people and offering food, is an action in which
there is a risk of two fitnahs (temptations): 
(1) that it might be an occasion for showing off and boasting, and 
(2) that it may constitute bid’ah, if people believe that such celebrations are part
of the religion and must be held every time a person completes the reading of the
Qur’aan. The first danger may be avoided by striving within oneself to be sincere
towards Allaah, and the second by restricting the invitees to a small number of family and
friends. 
We should not hold such gatherings regularly, lest people think it is a part of the Sunnah

696,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/696,Punishment of the one who leaves Islaam,"I am currently in a philosophy of religion class and my teacher is an atheist. He 
claims that under an Islamic state if a born Muslim converts to another religion he 
is killed. Please tell me if this is true.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
The punishment for apostasy (riddah) is well-known in Islaamic Sharee’ah. The one who leaves 
Islaam will be asked to repent by the Sharee’ah judge in an Islaamic country; if he does not 
repent and come back to the true religion, he will be killed as a kaafir and apostate, because of 
the command of the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): ""Whoever 
changes his religion, kill him."" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 3017).
It is well-known in Sharee’ah that the punishments (hudood) are not carried out on minors, 
because they have not yet reached the age of responsibility; but in the case of those who have 
reached the age of responsibility, the punishment (hadd) applies, without a doubt.
The person who knows the truth and believes in it, then turns his back on it, does not deserve 
to live. The punishment for apostasy is prescribed for the protection of the religion and as a 
deterrent to anyone who is thinking of leaving Islaam. There is no doubt that such a serious 
crime must be met with an equally weighty punishment. If the kuffaar do not give people the 
freedom to cross a red light, how can we give freedom to people to leave Islaam and disbelieve 
in Allaah when they want to? 
It seems that the intention of the teacher mentioned in the question was to shock the students 
with news of this ruling, in order to mislead them from the way of Allaah. You must respond 
and explain to him and the other students as much as you can. 
May Allaah make you and us bearers of His Message and defenders of His Sharee’ah.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
