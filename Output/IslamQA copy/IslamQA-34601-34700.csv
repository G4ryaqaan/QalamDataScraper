Can the one who gave him the car buy it or is it not permissible for him to buy it?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    It is not permissible for the giver to buy the thing he gave 
    to his brother. It was narrated that ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) 
    said: I gave a horse to someone (to ride in jihad) for the sake of Allaah, 
    and its owner neglected it. I thought that he would sell it cheaply, so I 
    asked the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) about that, and he said: “Do not buy it, even if he gives it to you for 
    a dirham, for the one who takes back his charity is like a dog that goes 
    back to its vomit.”

34604,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34604,Will a person be rewarded for any calamity such as disease or an accident that befalls him?,"Witchcraft and the evil eye are trials from Allah. Will a person be rewarded if he is afflicted by either of them? Will a person be rewarded for any calamity such as disease or an accident that befalls him, or are there things that Islam says must be followed in order to attain the reward?",,,"Praise be to Allah.We have already posted, in the answer to question no. 10936, the fatwa of Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih ibn ‘Uthyameen (may Allah have mercy on him), which states that the calamities for which a Muslim may be rewarded are those which he bears with patience and seeks the reward from Allah, may He be blessed and exalted. 
Undoubtedly being afflicted by the evil eye and witchcraft are some of the greatest calamities that may befall a Muslim, for their effects on the mind, heart and body of the victim may be serious. Bearing that with patience will bring a great reward from Allah. 
It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas that a black woman came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: “I suffer from epilepsy and I become uncovered. Pray to Allah for me.” He said: “If you wish, you can be patient and Paradise will be yours, or if you wish I will pray to Allah to heal you.” She said, “I will be patient.” Then she said: “But I become uncovered. Pray to Allah that I will not become uncovered.” So he prayed for her. Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5652; Muslim, 2576. 
The calamities that befall a person and affect him or his wealth or his family are not completely bad, rather they may result in a lot of good for a person. 
Allah has told us in His Book of that which may reduce the impact of the calamity on a person and encourage him to seek reward, namely patience and saying Inna Lillaahi wa inna ilayhi raaji’oon (Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return). This is a promise from Allah that He will fulfil. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“but give glad tidings to As- Saabiroon (the patient).
156. Who, when afflicted with calamity, say: ‘Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return.’
157. They are those on whom are the Salawaat (i.e. who are blessed and will be forgiven) from their Lord, and (they are those who) receive His Mercy, and it is they who are the guided ones” [al-Baqarah 2:155-157]
Ibn al-Qayyim said: 
This phrase is one of the greatest means of dealing with calamity and is one of the most beneficial in this world and in the Hereafter. It comprises two great principles which, if a person understands them properly, will bring him consolation for the calamity that has befallen him: 
1 – That the person, his family and his wealth all belong to Allah in a real sense; they have been given to him as a loan, and if they are taken from him, that is like the lender taking back his property from the borrower. 
2 – The person will ultimately return to Allah his Lord. He will inevitably leave this world behind and come before his Lord on his own as He created him the first time, with no family, no wealth, no tribe, rather with good deeds and bad deeds. If this is how he started and is how he is going to end, then how can he rejoice over what he has or grieve over what he does not have? Thinking about how he began and how he will end is the best remedy for this problem. ""Zad al-Ma’ad, 4/189""
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has told us that bearing hardships and calamities with patience is something that can only be done by those who have achieved true faith. 
It was narrated that Subhayb al-Roomi (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “How wonderful is the affair of the believer, for his affair is all good, and this applies to no one except the believer. If something good happens to him, he gives thanks and that is good for him, and if something bad happens to him, he bears it with patience, and he will be rewarded for that, so everything that Allah has decreed for the Muslim is good.” Narrated by Muslim, 2999. 
Trials and calamities are a test, and are a sign of Allah’s love for a person. They are like medicine: even if it is bitter, you offer it despite its bitterness to one whom you love – and for Allah is the highest description. According to a saheeh hadeeth: “The greatest reward comes with the greatest trial. When Allah loves a people He tests them. Whoever accepts that wins His pleasure but whoever is discontent with that earns His wrath.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2396; Ibn Maajah, 4031; classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albani. 
We should not hate the trials that Allah has decreed for us. Al-Hasan al-Basri (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Do not hate the trials that befall you or the calamities that happen to you, for they may be something that you hate but it leads to your salvation, and there may be something that you love, but it leads to your doom.

34605,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34605,Soundness of the Hadeeth “Whoever persists in saying the first takbeer at the beginning of Fajr prayer for forty days…”?,Is there a hadeeth which says that one who persists in saying the first takbeer (saying Allahu Akbar) at the beginning of Fajr prayer for forty days will be free of kufr (disbelief) and hypocrisy?,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    In Shu’ab 
    al-Eeman by al-Bayhaqi there is a marfoo’ hadeeth (report) narrated from 
    Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) according to which the 
    Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever prays Fajr 
    and ‘Isha in congregation and does not miss one rak’ah, he will be recorded 
    as being free from two things: free from the Fire and free from 
    hypocrisy.” (Shu’ab al-Eeman, 3/62). 

    It says in 
    al-‘Ilal al-Mutanahiyah: This hadeeth is not saheeh (authentic) and its 
    narrators are not known apart from Bakr ibn Ahmad narrating from Ya’qoob ibn 
    Tahiyyah, both of whose condition is unknown. (1/432).  

    But a 
    different version was narrated in Sunan al-Tirmithi, where it says: “Whoever 
    prays to Allah for forty days in congregation, catching up with the first 
    takbeer, he will be recorded as being free from two things: free from the 
    Fire and free from hypocrisy.” (al-Tirmithi no. 241; classed as da’eef by 
    al-Tirmithi but as hasan/sound by al-Albani). 

    This 
    hadeeth was also classed as da’eef by a number of earlier scholars, who 
    stated that it is mursal (chain does not reach the Companions), but it was 
    classed as hasan by some of the later scholars. See Talkhees al-Habeer, 
    2/27. 

    The 
    hadeeth is not limited to Fajr prayer only, rather the reward mentioned in 
    the hadeeth is connected to being present for the opening takbeer of all the 
    five daily prayers. 

    
    Undoubtedly being keen to catch up with the opening takbeer for this period 
    of time is an indication of the strength of a person’s religious 
    commitment. 

    So long as 
    the hadeeth can be interpreted in a sound manner, there is the hope that the 
    one who is keen to do what is mentioned therein will attain this great 
    virtue. The least that he will attain by means of this keenness is training 
    himself to regularly observe this important rite of Islam.

Is there a difference between men and women? Is it essential that the one who lowers a woman into her grave be one of her mahrams?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah

    is knowledgeable, and the one who is knowledgeable may direct the one who has no knowledge to carry out this task. 
It is not essential for the one who lowers

Charity is given to the poor and needy to meet their needs, and is done with the intention of seeking the Face of Allah. There is no intention of giving it to a specific person, rather it is given to any poor or needy person. 
A gift is not necessarily given to a poor person, rather it may be given to rich or poor; the intention is to show friendship and to honour the recipient. 
Both of them – charity and gift-giving – are righteous deeds for which a person will be rewarded, but which is better? 
Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah] said in Majmoo’ al-Fataawa: 
Sadaqah (charity) is that which is given for the sake of Allah as an act of worship, without intending to give it to a specific person and without seeking anything in return, rather it is given to charitable causes, such as to the needy. A gift is given with the intention of honouring a specific person, either because you love him and he is your friend, or because you want something. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to accept gifts and reward people for them, so that no one could remind him of their favours, but he did not accept the “refuse” of people that they gave to purify themselves of sins, namely charity. He did not accept charity for this and other reasons. Once this is understood, then charity is better, but there is a sense in which a gift is better than charity, such as giving a gift to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) during his lifetime out of love for him, or the gifts which a person gives to a relative in order to uphold the ties of kinship, or to a brother in Islam. These gifts may be better than charity. 
End quote. 
Based on this, if you give a gift to one of your relatives, that may be better than giving charity, because it is more befitting to uphold the ties of kinship. The same may apply if you give a gift to a friend of yours, because that will strengthen the bonds of love between you. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Exchange gifts, you will love one another.” Narrated by al-Bukhari in al-Adab al-Mufrad. Ibn Hajar said: its isnaad is hasan. It was also classed as hasan by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Adab al-Mufrad, 463. 
What the hadeeth means is that giving gifts may generate and increase love.

    cannot hear the voice of the muezzin without amplification, then Jumu’ah prayer is not obligatory on you, and you can pray Zuhr. 
But if you are inside the city, or you are 
    outside but you can hear the adhaan, then it is obligatory for you to attend Jumu’ah prayer. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    was asked about some workers who are not permitted by their employers to attend Jumu’ah on the grounds that they work as guards on a farm.  
He answered: 
If these workers are so far from the mosque 
    that they would not be able to hear the adhaan without a loudspeaker, and they are outside the town, then they do not have to pray Jumu’ah. The 
    workers may rest assured that there is no sin on them if they stay on the farm and pray Zuhr. But we advise their employer to give them permission

The five daily prayers should be offered in 
    the mosque in congregation, so you have to perform them in congregation in the mosque. You have to be patient and seek reward in doing that, and

34618,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34618,One of the signs of the Hour is that time will pass more quickly,Is it one of the signs of the hour that days will pass quickly and will become short?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Perhaps the questioner is referring to the hadeeth narrated 
    by al-Bukhaari (1036) from Abu Hurayrah who said: The Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The Hour will not begin until 
    knowledge is taken away, earthquakes increase, time passes quickly, 
    tribulations appear, and there is a lot of haraj, which is killing, 
    killing, and until there will be a lot of wealth among you and it will 
    become abundant.” 

    And Ahmad narrated (10560) that Abu Hurayrah said: The 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “The Hour will not begin until time passes quickly, so a year will be like a 
    month, and a month will be like a week, and a week will be like a day, and a 
    day will be like an hour, and an hour will be like the burning of a braid of 
    palm leaves.”  

    Ibn Katheer said: Its isnaad is (saheeh) according to the 
    conditions of Muslim. And it was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in 
    Saheeh al-Jaami’, 7422. 

    These two ahaadeeth indicate that one of the signs of the 
    Hour is that time will pass more quickly. 

    The scholars differed concerning the meaning of the phrase 
    taqaarub al-zamaan (time passing more quickly). There are many views, the 
    strongest of which is:  

    That the phrase taqaarub al-zamaan (time passing quickly) may 
    be interpreted literally or metaphorically. 

    The metaphorical meaning is that barakah (blessing) will 
    disappear from time, which is something that started a long time ago. 

    This was the view favoured by al-Qaadi ‘Iyaad, al-Nawawi and 
    al-Haafiz ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on them). 

    Al-Nawawi said: what is meant by its becoming short is that 
    there will be no barakah in it, and that the benefit that a person gets from 
    one day, for example, will be the equivalent of the benefit that he used to 
    get in a single hour. 

    Al-Haafiz said: The fact of the matter is that what it means 
    is that barakah will disappear from everything, even from time. That is one 
    of the signs that the Hour is at hand. 
The metaphorical meaning 
    also includes ease and speed of travel between distant places, so that it 
    may be regarded as time passing more quickly. Distances that took months to 
    cross in the past do not take more than a number of hours nowadays. 

    Shaykh Ibn Baaz said, in his commentary on Fath al-Baari, 
    2/522: the time passing quickly mentioned in the hadeeth may be interpreted 
    in the sense of what has happened nowadays, where the distances between 
    cities and regions have grown shorter and it takes less time to travel 
    between them, because of the invention of planes, cars, broadcasting, etc. 
    And Allaah knows best. 

    With regard to the literal meaning, that days will become 
    shorter in a real sense, so that the hours of night and day pass quickly, 
    this has not happened yet, but it is not something impossible. This is 
    supported by the fact that the days of the Dajjaal will become longer so 
    that a day will be like a year or a month or a week in length. Just as days 
    may become longer, they may also become shorter. That will be because of the 
    world system going out of control and the approach of the end of the world. 

    In al-Fath, al-Haafiz quoted Ibn Abi Jamrah as 
    saying: 
It may be that what is 
    meant by time passing quickly is that time will literally become shorter, 
    based on what is said in the hadeeth: “The Hour will not begin until a year 
    is like a month.” Based on this, then the shortening of time may be 
    understood in a literal sense, or it may be metaphorical. In the real sense 
    it has not started yet, but it may be one of the things that will happen 
    when the Hour is at hand. With regard to the metaphorical sense, it appeared 
    some time ago. This is known to the religious scholars and also to those who 
    are smart and involved in worldly affairs, for they find that none of them 
    can do as much work as they used to do before, and they complain about that 
    and do not know the reason for it. Perhaps that is because of the weakness 
    of faith and the emergence of things that go against Islam in many ways. The 
    worst of that lack of barakah is mostly manifested in provision, because the 
    sources of provision are either completely haraam or are dubious, as is 
    obvious to everyone, to such an extent that many people do not care where 
    their provision comes from; wherever they can get they take it and they do 
    not care.  In fact the barakah in time, provision and agriculture can only 
    be obtained by means of strength of faith, following Allaah’s commands and 
    heeding His prohibitions. The proof of that is the words of Allaah 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And if the people of the towns had believed and had the 
    Taqwa (piety), certainly, We should have opened for them blessings from the 
    heaven and the earth”

    [al-A’raaf 7:96]

    Al-Suyooti said something similar in al-Haawi li’l-Fataawi 
    (1/44), where he said concerning the meaning of this hadeeth: 

    It was said that this is in fact literal, and that the hours 
    of day and night will grow shorter when the onset of the Hour is at hand. 
    And it was said that it is metaphorical, and that what is meant is that days 
    will pass quickly and the barakah will be removed from all things, even from 
    time…. And there are other opinions as well. And Allaah knows best. 

    There is no contradiction between these three views, that it 
    means the removal of blessing, ease of transportation and time passing more 
    quickly in a literal sense. There is no reason why the hadeeth should not be 
    interpreted as meaning all of them. And Allaah knows best. 

    There are other opinions concerning the meaning of “time 
    passing quickly,” but they are not as strong as the opinions quoted above. 
    For example there is the view of al-Khattaabi, which is that life will 
    become enjoyable. Al-Haafiz said: It means – and Allaah knows best – that 
    this will happen at the time of the Mahdi, when security and justice prevail 
    throughout the earth, and life will become enjoyable at that time, and 
    people will feel that time is shorter; because people feel that times of 
    ease are short even when they are long, and they feel that times of hardship 
    last long, even if they are short. Then al-Haafiz said: Rather al-Khattaabi 
    interpreted it in this manner because that this shortness of time had not 
    yet happened in his era. But what the hadeeth refers to is happening in our 
    time, for we see that days are passing quickly in a way that did not happen 
    during previous times, even though there is no easy life. In fact the 
    meaning is metaphorical and refers to the removal of barakah. 

    Another opinion was that of Ibn Battaal, which is that what 
    is meant is that people will become similar to one another in their lack of 
    religious commitment, so that there will not be anyone among them who 
    enjoins what is good and forbids what is evil, because of the prevalence of 
    evil and its people. 

    This interpretation goes against the apparent meaning of the 
    hadeeth and is refuted by what the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said in another hadeeth: “The Hour will not begin until 
    time passes more quickly so that a year will be like a month…” It is obvious 
    that what is meant is that time itself will pass more quickly, not that 
    people will start to resemble one another in their lack of religious 
    commitment. 

    And Allaah knows best.

Some of the Sahaabah used this word with regard to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Khillah (close friendship) is the highest form of mahabbah (love). 
But the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had no khaleel (close friend) because Allaah took him as a close friend. But this does not contradict what the Sahaabah said about regarding him as their khaleel, because it is not a condition of khillah (close friendship) that each party regards the other as a khaleel. 
It was narrated that Abu Dharr said: I heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say, five days before he died, “I declare before Allaah that I have no khaleel from among you, for Allaah has taken me as a khaleel as He took Ibraaheem as a khaleel. But if I were to have taken anyone from among my ummah as a khaleel, I would have taken Abu Bakr as a khaleel. But those who came before you used to take the graves of their Prophets and righteous men as places of worship. Do not take graves as places of worship, for I forbid you to do that.” 
Narrated by Muslim, 532. 
And it was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: My close friend (khaleel – i.e. the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)) enjoined three things upon me that I will not give up until I die: fasting three days of each month, praying Duha, and sleeping after Witr. 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1124; Muslim, 721. 
Al-Haafiz Ibn Jahar said: 
The khaleel is a sincere friend whom one takes as a close friend because love for him takes deep root in one’s heart.  There was some scholarly dispute as to whether khillah (close friendship) is of a higher status than mahabbah (love) or vice versa. These words of Abu Hurayrah do not contradict what we have quoted above from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “But if I were to have taken anyone from among my ummah as a khaleel, I would have taken Abu Bakr as a khaleel”, because the fact that he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not take anyone as a close friend does not rule out the opposite, and no one says that close friendship can only be complete if each party regards the other as a khaleel, because the Sahaabi looked at this relationship from his own point of view, or perhaps he only meant companionship and love.  
Fath al-Baari, 3/57 
This word was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) more than once. 
This word was also used by the great Sahaabi Abu Dharr al-Ghifaari with regard to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), as was narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1342; Muslim, 992. And it was mentioned in another hadeeth narrated by Muslim, 648. 
It is worth pointing out here that we should think before we speak such words that indicate deep love and sincere friendship, and look at the basis and purpose of the relationship, and ensure that it is far removed from any haraam attachment or things that are not pleasing to Allaah, so that it will not be a source of loss and regret on the Day of Resurrection:

Four things to be avoided regarding belief in Allah’s Names and Attributes","Praise be to Allah.Meaning of belief in Allah
Faith in Allah means believing firmly in His existence, Lordship and Divinity, and in His Names and Attributes. 
Four things necessary for achieving belief in Allah 
Faith in Allah implies four things, whoever believes in them is a true believer. 
1 – Belief in the existence of Allah. 
The existence of Allah is something indicated by reason and by man's innate nature, let alone the large amount of shar’i (revelatory) evidence to that effect. 
(1) The evidence of man’s innate nature that Allah exists: every man has been created with an innate belief in his Creator without having to first think about it or be taught, and no one deviates from this innate nature except the one who has been exposed to misguiding influences. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no child who is not born in a state of fitrah (the natural inclination of man), but his parents make him a Jew, a Christian or a Magian.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1358; Muslim, 2658.
(2) The evidence of reason that Allah exists: all these created things, past, present and future, must have a Creator Who brought them into existence, because it is not possible for them to have created themselves or to have come into existence by accident.
It is impossible for them to have come into existence by themselves because a thing cannot create itself: before it existed it was non-existent, so how could it be a creator?! And it is impossible for them to have come into existence by accident, because everything that happens must have a cause. Moreover, this creation is done in a wondrous and precise manner, and every created being is in harmony with the rest of creation, and there is a strong connection between cause and effect. All of this makes it impossible that this universe could have come into being accidentally, because what happens accidentally does not happen in a precise and perfect manner, so how could it remain so precisely balanced?  
If it is not possible for these things to have created themselves or to have come into existence by accident, then there must be One Who brought them into existence, namely Allah the Lord of the Worlds. 
Rational evidence and definitive proof of the existence of Allah in the Qur’an
Allah has mentioned this rational evidence and definitive proof in Surat al-Toor, where He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Were they created by nothing? Or were they themselves the creators?” [al-Toor 52:35]
They were not created without a Creator, and they did not create themselves, so their Creator must be Allah, may He be blessed and exalted. Hence when Jubayr ibn Mut’im heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) reciting Soorat al-Toor, and he reached these verses (interpretation of the meaning):
“Were they created by nothing? Or were they themselves the creators?
 Or did they create the heavens and the earth? Nay, but they have no firm Belief.
Or are with them the treasures of your Lord? Or are they the tyrants with the authority to do as they like?” [al-Toor 52:35-37]
Jubayir was a mushrik at that time, and said: “My heart almost soared, and that was the first moment that faith entered my heart.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari in several places. )
We will give you an example that will help to explain that:  
If a person were to tell you of a beautiful palace, surrounded by gardens among which rivers flowed, filled with furniture and couches, decorated with all kinds of luxuries and adornments, and told you that this palace and all that it contains created itself, or came into existence like that by accident without anyone building it, you would hasten to deny that and regard it as a lie, and you would regard this as foolish speech. So after that can it be possible that this wondrous, vast and well balanced universe with its earth, heavens and stars, could have created itself or come into being by accident with no Creator?! 
This rational evidence was understood by a Bedouin who lived in the desert and who expressed it most eloquently, when he was asked, “How do you know your Lord?” He said: “If you see the camel dung you know that a camel has passed this way, and if you see a footstep you know that a person has passed this way, so the heaven with its stars and the earth with its mountain passes and the oceans with their high waves all point to the existence of the All-Hearing, All-Seeing.” 
2 – Belief in the Lordship of Allah 
We mean the belief that He alone is the Lord, with no partner or helper. 
The Lord (Rabb) is the One Who has the power of  creation, dominion and control. There is no Creator except Allah, no Sovereign except Allah, no controller of affairs except Allah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Surely, His is the creation and commandment” [al-A’raaf 7:54] 
“Say (O Muhammad): ‘Who provides for you from the sky and the earth? Or who owns hearing and sight? And who brings out the living from the dead and brings out the dead from the living? And who disposes the affairs?’ They will say: ‘Allah.’ Say: ‘Will you not then be afraid of Allah’s punishment (for setting up rivals in worship with Allah)?’”[Yoonus 10:31] 
“He manages and regulates (every) affair from the heavens to the earth; then it (affair) will go up to Him” [al-Sajdah 32:5] 
“Such is Allah, your Lord; His is the kingdom. And those, whom you invoke or call upon instead of Him, own not even a Qitmeer (the thin membrane over the date stone)” [Faatir 35:13]
Think about what Allah says in Soorat al-Faatihah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The Only Owner (and the Only Ruling Judge) of the Day of Recompense (i.e. the Day of Resurrection) [Maaliki Yaawm il-deen]” [al-Faatihah 1:4]
And there is an alternative reading, Maliki yawm il-deen. If we  combine the two readings we will see a wondrous meaning, for the Malik (King) has more power and authority than the Maalik (Owner), but a king may sometimes be a king in name only, with no control over affairs, in which case he is a king but not an owner. But as Allah is both Malik and Maalik, then this is confirmation both of His Sovereignty and His control over all affairs. 
3 – Belief in His Divinity 
We mean the belief that He is the One True God, with no partner or associate. 
Allaah (God) means the One Who is loved, i.e., the One Who is worshipped out of love and veneration. This is what is meant by Laa ilaaha ill-Allah (there is no god but Allah), i.e., there is none who is rightfully worshipped except Allah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And your Ilaah (God) is One Ilaah (God — Allah), Laa Ilaaha illa Huwa (there is none who has the right to be worshipped but He), the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful” [al-Baqarah 2:163] 
“Allah bears witness that Laa ilaaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), and the angels, and those having knowledge (also give this witness); (He always) maintains His creation in justice. Laa ilaaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the All-Mighty, the All-Wise” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:18]
Everything that is taken as a god alongside Allah and worshipped instead of Him, its divinity is false. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“That is because Allah He is the Truth (the only True God of all that exists, Who has no partners or rivals with Him), and what they (the polytheists) invoke besides Him, it is Baatil (falsehood). And verily, Allah He is the Most High, the Most Great” [al-Hajj 22:62]
Calling them gods does not give them the rights of divinity. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“They are but names which you have named you and your fathers for which Allah has sent down no authority” [al-Najm 53:23]
Allah tells us that Yoosuf (peace be upon him) said to the prison guard (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Are many different lords (gods) better or Allah, the One, the Irresistible?
You do not worship besides Him but only names which you have named (forged) — you and your fathers — for which Allah has sent down no authority” [Yoosuf 12:39-40]
No one deserves to be worshipped or singled out for worship except Allah, and no one has any share in this right with Him, no angel who is close to Him nor any Prophet who was sent. Hence the call of all the Messengers, from the first to the last of them, was the call to say Laa ilaaha ill-Allah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And We did not send any Messenger before you (O Muhammad) but We revealed to him (saying): Laa ilaaha illa Ana [none has the right to be worshipped but I (Allah)], so worship Me (Alone and none else)” [al-Anbiya’ 21:25] 
“And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (community, nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): “Worship Allah (Alone), and avoid (or keep away from) Taaghoot (all false deities, i.e. do not worship Taaghoot besides Allah)” [al-Nahl 16:36]
But the mushrikeen (polytheists) rejected that and took other gods instead of Allah, which they worshipped alongside Allah, seeking their support and help. 
4 – Belief in His Names and Attributes
We mean affirming the names and attributes which Allah has affirmed for Himself in His Book and in the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in a manner that befits Him, without distorting or denying the meanings, or asking how, or likening Him to His creation. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allah, so call on Him by them, and leave the company of those who belie or deny (or utter impious speech against) His Names. They will be requited for what they used to do” [al-A’raaf 7:180]
This verse indicates that the Most Beautiful names belong to Allah.
And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“His is the highest description (i.e. none has the right to be worshipped but He, and there is nothing comparable unto Him) in the heavens and in the earth. And He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise” [al-Room 30:27]
This verse indicates that the attributes of perfection belong to Allah, because “the highest description” is the attribute of perfection. These two verses prove that the most beautiful Names and the most sublime attributes belong to Allah in general terms. With regard to the details of that, there is a great deal of information in the Qur’aan and Sunnah. 
This field of knowledge, i.e., the names and attributes of Allah, is one of the fields in which there has been a great deal of dispute and division among the ummah, and the ummah has split into various factions regarding the names and attributes of Allah.  
Our attitude towards these differences is that enjoined by Allah when He said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“(And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allah and His Messenger, if you believe in Allah and in the Last Day” [al-Nisa’ 4:59]
We refer this dispute to the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), seeking guidance therein from the way in which the righteous salaf (predecessors), the Sahaabah (Companions)and Taabi’een (generation after the Companions), understood these verses and ahaadeeth, for they are the most knowledgeable of this ummah as to what Allah and His Messenger meant. ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ood spoke the truth when he described the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) by saying: “Whoever wants to follow a path, let him follow the path of one who has died, for there is no guarantee that the one who is still alive will not be tempted. Those are the companions of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), the most pure in heart  of this ummah and the most deep in knowledge, the least sophisticated and complicated, people whom Allah chose to establish His religion and accompany His Prophet. So acknowledge their rights and adhere to their guidance, for they are following true guidance.”
Everyone who deviates from the path of the salaf in this matter is erring and going astray, and is following a path other than that of the believers, so he deserves the warning issued in the verse where Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger (Muhammad) after the right path has been shown clearly to him, and follows other than the believers’ way, We shall keep him in the path he has chosen, and burn him in Hell — what an evil destination!” [al-Nisa’ 4:115]
Allah has stipulated that in order to be correctly guided, we must believe what the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) believed, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So if they believe in the like of that which you believe then they are rightly guided” [al-Baqarah 2:137] 
Everyone who deviates and wanders far from the path of the salaf is lacking in guidance to the extent that he strays from the path of the salaf. 
Based on this, then what we must do in this case is to affirm what Allah has affirmed for Himself or what His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has affirmed of the divine names and attributes; we should take the texts of the Qur’aan and Sunnah at face value, and believe in them as the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did, as they are the best and most knowledgeable of this ummah (may Allah be pleased with them). 
Four things to be avoided regarding belief in Allah’s Names and Attributes
But it should be noted that there are four things to be avoided, whoever falls into one of them has not attained true belief in the names and attributes of Allah as he is obliged to do. Belief in the names and attributes of Allah is not correct unless one avoids these four things, which are: tahreef (distortion), ta’teel (denial), tamtheel (likening Allah to His creation) and takyeef (asking or discussing how).  
Hence we say that what is meant by belief in the names and attributes of Allah is “affirming the names and attributes which Allah has affirmed for Himself in His Book and in the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in a manner that befits Him, without distorting or denying the meanings, or asking how, or likening Him to His creation.” 
There follows a brief explanation of these four things that are to be avoided: 
1.      Tahreef (distorting)
What is meant is changing the meaning of the texts of the Qur’aan and Sunnah from their true meaning, which means affirming that the most beautiful names and sublime attributes belong to Allah, to another meaning which was not intended by Allah or His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
For example: 
They distort the meaning of the Hand of Allah which is mentioned in many texts and say that it refers to His blessing or power. 
2.                Ta’teel (denying)
What is meant is denying the beautiful names and sublime attributes and saying that Allah does not possess them or some of them. 
Everyone who denies one of the names or attributes of Allah that are proven in the Qur’aan or Sunnah does not truly believe in the names and attributes of Allah.
3.                Tamtheel (likening Allah to His creation)
This means likening the attribute of Allah to the attribute of a human being, such as saying that Allah’s Hand is like a man’s hand, or that Allah hears as a man hears, or that Allah rose over the Throne like a man sitting on a chair… and so on. Undoubtedly likening the attributes of Allah to the attributes of His creation is wrong and false. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“There is nothing like Him, and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer” [al-Shoora 42:11]
4.                Takyeef (discussing how)
This means discussing how the attributes of Allah are, whereby a person tries to imagine or put into words how the attributes of Allah are. 
This is definitely invalid, and man cannot know this. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“but they will never encompass anything of His Knowledge” [Ta-Ha 20:110]
Whoever attains these four things believes truly in Allah. 
We ask Allah to make us steadfast in faith and cause us to die therein. 
And Allah knows best.

34631,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34631,Giving zakaah to a seeker of knowledge,"If a man devotes all his time to seeking Islamic knowledge, is it permissible to give him zakaah to cover his living expenses and to buy books?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.There are eight areas in which zakaah may be spent. These are mentioned in the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“As-Sadaqaat (here it means Zakaah) are only for the Fuqaraa’ (poor), and Al Masaakeen (the poor) and those employed to collect (the funds); and to attract the hearts of those who have been inclined (towards Islam); and to free the captives; and for those in debt; and for Allaah’s Cause (i.e. for Mujaahidoon — those fighting in a holy battle), and for the wayfarer (a traveller who is cut off from everything); a duty imposed by Allaah. And Allaah is All-Knower, All-Wise”
[al-Tawbah 9:60]
What is meant by fi sabeel-Illaah (for Allaah’s Cause) is jihad fought so that the Word of Allaah will be supreme. So the mujaahid should be given what he needs to cover his expenses and to buy weapons.
The scholars said: fi sabeel-Illaah (for Allaah’s Cause) also includes a man who devotes all his time to seeking Islamic knowledge, so he should be given from the zakaah funds enough to cover his expenses for clothing, food and drink, accommodation and the books of knowledge that he needs, because Islamic knowledge is a kind of jihad for the sake of Allaah. Indeed, Imam Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: There is nothing like knowledge for the one whose intention is sound.
Knowledge is the foundation of the whole religion, and there is no religion without knowledge. Allaah revealed the Book so that mankind may keep up justice, and learn the rulings of their religion, and the beliefs, words and deeds that are enjoined upon them.
With regard to jihad for the sake of Allaah – yes, it is the noblest of deeds, and is indeed the pinnacle of Islam, and there is no doubt concerning its virtue. But knowledge has a high status in Islam, and the fact that it is included in jihad is obvious and there is no doubt concerning that.
Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 337-338.
The Standing Committee was asked:
Is it permissible to give zakaah funds to seekers of knowledge who are in desperate need?
They replied:
Yes, it is permissible to give them zakaah to meet their needs.
Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 10/17.
It says in al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah:
The fuqaha’ are agreed that it is permissible to give zakaah to seekers of knowledge. This was clearly stated by the Hanafis and Shaafa’is and Hanbalis, and this is what is understood from the Maaliki madhhab. Some of the Hanafis were of the view that it is permissible for a seeker of knowledge to accept zakaah even if he is rich, if he is devoting all his time to seeking knowledge and teach others, because he is unable to earn a living otherwise.
Al-Nawawi said: If he is able to earn a living that suits his situation, but he is too busy acquiring Islamic knowledge to such an extent that if he were to start earning a living he would have to stop seeking knowledge, then it is permissible for him to receive zakaah, because seeking knowledge is a communal obligation (fard kafaayah).
Ibn Taymiyah was asked about someone who did not have enough money to buy books to study. He said: It is permissible for him to take zakaah for what he needs to buy books of knowledge that he needs for his religious and worldly interests.
Al-Buhooti said: Perhaps that is included in the areas where zakaah may be given, because that comes under the heading of what the seeker of knowledge needs, so it is like his other expenses. The fuqaha’ said that it is permissible to give zakaah to seekers of Islamic knowledge only.
The Hanafis clearly stated that it is permissible to transfer zakaah from one land to another to give it to a seeker of knowledge.

34634,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34634,Can it be said of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) “Habeeb-Allaah (the Beloved of Allaah)”?,Can the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) be described as “Habeeb-Allaah (the Beloved of Allaah)”?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is undoubtedly the Beloved of Allaah; he loves Allaah and Allaah loves him. But there is a better description than that, which is Khaleel-Allaah (the Close Friend of Allaah). The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was the Close Friend of Allaah, as he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah has taken me as a close friend (khaleel) just as he took Ibraaheem as a close friend.” (Narrated by Muslum, 532). 
Being a close friend is the most perfect form of love. 
Hence whoever describes him as “habeeb” only is not giving him his full due. Close friendship (being a “khaleel”) is greater and more sublime than love. All the believers are beloved to Allaah, but the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) occupies a higher status than that, which is close friendship. Allaah took him as a close friend just as He took Ibraaheem as a close friend. Hence we say that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the Close Friend of Allaah. This is better than saying that he is the Beloved of Allaah, because the Arabic word khillah (close friendship) implies love and more, because it is the ultimate love. 
Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him), 1/319. 
Shaykh al-Islam said in Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 10/204: 
The view of some people that Muhammad is the Beloved of Allaah and Ibraaheem is the Close Friend of Allaah, and their notion that love (hubb) is superior to close friendship (khillah), is a weak view, because Muhammad is also the Close Friend of Allaah (Khaleel-Allaah), as was proven in many saheeh ahaadeeth. 
And Ibn al-Qayyim said in Rawdat al-Muhibbeen, 1/49: 
Some of those who have no knowledge think that a “beloved (habeeb)” is superior to a “close friend (khaleel)”, so they say “Muhammad is the Beloved of Allaah and Ibraaheem is the Close Friend of Allaah.” This is false for many reasons: 
For example: close friendship is specific whereas love is general. Allaah loves those who repent, and He loves those who purify themselves, and He says of His believing slaves (interpretation of the meaning): 
“whom He will love and they will love Him”
[al-Maa'idah 5:54]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stated that he had no close friend among the people of this world, but he stated that the most beloved of women to him was ‘Aa’ishah and the most beloved of men to him was her father. 
And he said: “Allaah has taken me as a close friend (khaleel) just as he took Ibraaheem as a close friend.” 
And he said: “If I were to have taken any of the people of this world as a close friend, I would have taken Abu Bakr as a close friend, but (between us) is the brotherhood and love of Islam.” 
Note: 
There is a hadeeth which appears to contradict the above statement that close friendship (khillah) is superior to love (hubb). It was narrated by al-Tirmidhi (3161) from Ibn ‘Abbaas who said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Ibraaheem was the Close Friend of Allaah and Moosa was the one with whom Allaah spoke, and ‘Eesa was a spirit and Word created by Allaah, and Adam was chosen by Allaah, but I am the Beloved of Allaah and I am not boasting…” 
This hadeeth is da’eef (weak) and is not soundly narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). It was classed as da’eef by al-Albaani in Da’eef al-Tirmidhi.",Islam Q&A

Should I accept it or is it better to refrain and be content with what I have?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Al-Bukhaari (2585) narrated that ‘Aa’ishah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to accept gifts and reward people for giving them. 
“Reward people for giving them” means giving the giver something of equal value at least in return. This was the view of al-Haafiz in al-Fath. 
This hadeeth indicates that accepting gifts and giving something of equal value to the giver is the way of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoined responding in kind to favours, as he said: “Whoever does you a favour, respond in kind, and if you cannot find the means of doing so, then keep praying for him until you think that you have responded in kind.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 1672. classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
“Whoever does you a favour” means, whoever treats you kindly in word or deed. 
“Respond in kind” means, treat him kindly just as he has treated you kindly. 
“If you cannot find the means of doing so” means if you do not have the money. 
“Until you think that you have responded in kind” means, repeat the du’aa’ until you think that you have given him his due. 
One of the du’aa’s that you can say is Jazaak Allahu khayran (may Allah reward you with good). Al-Tirmidhi (2035) narrated that Usaamah ibn Zayd said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever has a favour done for him and says Jazaak Allahu khayran (may Allah reward you with good) has done his utmost to thank him.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2035; classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
“Done his utmost to thank him” means, he has done his utmost to express his thanks, because he has acknowledged his shortcomings and that he is unable to reward him and thank him, so he refers the matter to Allah, that He might reward him in the best manner. One of them said: If you are unable to give him back in kind, then speak at length thanking him and making du’aa’ for him. From Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi. 
The Standing Committee was asked a similar question, and replied as follows: 
There is nothing wrong with accepting it (an amount of money as a gift), without you longing for that, and you can respond in kind if you are able to with an appropriate gift, or you can make du’aa’ for him, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does you a favour, respond in kind, and if you cannot find the means of doing so, then keep praying for him until you think that you have responded in kind.”   Narrated by Abu Dawood and al-Nasaa’i.

34644,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34644,Mistakes in Tawaf,"During tawaf, we noticed that some people stand at the beginning of tawaf and utter out loud their intention of doing tawaf. We also noticed that some of them push and shove in order to reach the Black Stone, and even fight over it. What is your opinion about these actions?",Some of the mistake made in tawaf include: 1- Uttering the intention out loud; 2- Pushing and shoving too much when touching Black Stone; 3- Thinking touching the Black Stone is done for barakah; 4- Reciting a specific du’a in each circuit.,"Mistakes made in tawaf


Ruling on one those who make mistakes in tawaf","Praise be to Allah.Mistakes made in tawaf
These are mistakes that occur during tawaf , and are of various types: 

Uttering the intention out loud when wanting to do tawaf , so you see the pilgrim standing facing the Black Stone when he wants to do tawaf, saying, “O Allah, I intend to do seven circuits of tawaf for ‘Umrah” or “O Allah, I intend to do seven circuits of tawaf for Hajj,” or “O Allah, I intend to do seven circuits of tawaf in order to draw closer to You.” 

Uttering the intention out loud is bid’ah (an innovation). The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not command his ummah to do that. Everyone who worships Allah in a manner in which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not worship Him or command his ummah to do so has introduced an innovation into the religion of Allah that is not part of it. 
So uttering the intention out loud when doing tawaf is a mistake and an innovation. Just as it is a mistake from the point of view of Shari’ah, it is also a mistake from a rational point of view. 
What is the point of uttering the intention out loud when the intention is a matter between you and your Lord, and Allah knows what is in people’s hearts and He knows that you are going to circumambulate this House. If Allah knows that then there is no need to say that out loud to the slaves of Allah. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did tawaf before you and he did not speak the intention out loud. The Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) did tawaf before you and did not speak the intention out loud when they did tawaf, or when doing any other act of worship, so this is a mistake. 

Some of those who do tawaf push and shove too much when they touch the Black Stone and the Yemeni Corner , and they are disturbed by the overcrowding and disturb others. They may be pushing and shoving a woman, and the Shaytan may tempt him and fill his heart with desire when he is crowding this woman in this narrow place. People are only human and may be overwhelmed by their souls that prompt them to do evil, so an evil action may take place in the shadow of the House of Allah. This is a matter that becomes even worse in light of where it takes place, although it is a fitnah in any place it happens. 

It is not prescribed to push and shove when touching the Black Stone or the Yemeni Corner, rather if it is easy for you to do so in a calm and dignified manner, then you must do it, and if it is not easy for you to do it, then you should just point to the Black Stone. 
With regard to the Yemeni Corner, there is no report from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that he pointed to it, and we cannot compare it to the Black Stone, because the Black Stone is greater than it, and it was proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) pointed to the Black Stone.  
Just as crowding is not prescribed in this situation and there is the fear that it may cause fitnah when one is crowded together with women, so too it may also cause annoyance, because in crowded situations a person will inevitably hear words that he dislikes and he will feel annoyed and angry when he leaves this place.  
What the person who is doing tawaf should do is always remain calm and dignified, so that he will have the proper presence of mind for worshipping Allah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Tawaf around the House and (Sa’i) between al-Safa and al-Marwah and the stoning of the Jimar have only been prescribed so that remembrance of Allah (dhikr) will be established.”

Some people think that tawaf is not valid unless one kisses the Black Stone , and that kissing the Black Stone is one of the conditions of tawaf being valid, and of Hajj and ‘Umrah being valid too. This is a mistaken notion. Kissing the Black Stone is Sunnah, and it is not an independent Sunnah either, rather it is Sunnah for the one who is doing tawaf. I do not know that kissing the Black Stone is Sunnah except in tawaf. Based on this, since kissing the Black Stone is Sunnah and is not obligatory and is not a condition of Tawaf, then if a person does not kiss it, we do not say that his tawaf is invalid or that his tawaf is lacking and he is sinning. Rather his tawaf is valid and if there is a lot of crowding then pointing is better than touching, because this is what the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did when the place was crowded, and because by doing this a person avoids harm that he may do to others or that others may do to him. 

If someone were to ask us: If the Mataf (place of tawaf) is very crowded, what do you think – is it better to push in and touch and kiss the Black Stone, or to point to it? 
We say that it is better to point to it, because that is the Sunnah. That was narrated from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 

Kissing the Yemeni Corner. There is no proof concerning this from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and if an act of worship is not proven from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) then it is bid’ah and is not an act of worship that brings one closer to Allah. Based on this, it is not prescribed to kiss the Yemeni Corner, because that was not proven from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Rather that was narrated in a da’if (weak) hadith that cannot be taken as evidence. 
Some people, when they touch the Black Stone or Yemeni Corner, touch it with their left hands in a careless manner. This is a mistake, because the right hand is better than the left hand, and the left hand is only used for unclean things such as cleaning oneself after relieving oneself, or rinsing one's nose, and so on. When it comes to matters of kissing and respect, the right hand should be used. 
They think that touching the Black Stone and the Yemeni corner is done for barakah or blessing, not as part of the ritual of tawaf, so they touch them seeking barakah from them. This is undoubtedly contrary to the purpose, for the purpose of touching the Black Stone or wiping it or kissing it is to glorify Allah. Hence when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) touched the Black Stone he said: “Allahu akbar,” as an indication that the purpose of this action is to glorify Allah, not to seek barakah by touching this stone. Hence when the caliph ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) touched the Black Stone he said: “By Allah, I know that you are just a stone and can neither cause harm nor bring benefit. Were it not that I had seen the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) kiss you, I would not have kissed you.” 

This mistaken notion held by some people – that the purpose behind touching the Yemeni Corner and the Black Stone is to seek barakah – has led some of them to bring their young children and touch the Corner or the Stone with their hands, then wipe their children with their hands. This is a corrupt belief that should be denounced. We should explain to people that these stones can neither harm nor benefit, and that the purpose of touching them is to glorify Allah and establish His remembrance (dhikr), and to follow the example of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
All of these matters and others are not prescribed in shari’ah. Rather they are innovations (bid’ah) and do not benefit those who do them in any way. But if the one who does that is ignorant and does not realize that this is bid’ah, then there is the hope that he may be forgiven. But if he knows that this is bid’ah or is negligent and does not ask about his religion, then he is sinning. 

Some people recite a specific du’a in each circuit . This is a kind of bid’ah that was not narrated from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or his Companions. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not recite a specific du’a in each circuit, and neither did his Companions. The most that can be said concerning that is that between the Yemeni Corner and the Black Stone the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say: “Our Lord! Give us in this world that which is good and in the Hereafter that which is good, and save us from the torment of the Fire!” [al-Baqarah 2:201 – interpretation of the meaning].  

And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Tawaf around the House and (Sa’i) between al-Safa and al-Marwah and the stoning of the Jimar have only been prescribed so that remembrance of Allah (dhikr) will be established.” 
This bid’ah is even more wrong when the person carries a small booklet in which there is a du’a for each circuit, and he reads this booklet, not knowing what he is saying, either because he does not know Arabic and does not understand the meanings, or because although he is an Arab and speaks Arabic he does not know what he is saying. We even hear some of them say du’as that clearly deviate from Islamic teaching; for example, we have heard someone saying, “O Allah, make me independent of means by Your Majesty (jalalika) so I have no need of that which You have forbidden” when he should have said, “by that which You have permitted (halalika).” 
We also see some people reading this booklet, and when they finish the du’a for the circuit they are doing, they stop and do not recite any other du’as for the rest of that circuit. If there are not many people in the Mataf, they finish the circuit before they finish the du’a, so they cut the du’a short. 
The remedy for that is to explain to the pilgrims that during tawaf a person can say whatever du’a he wants, and he can remember Allah (dhikr) however he wants. If this is explained to the people this problem will go away. 
Ruling on one those who make mistakes in tawaf
With regard to these actions, people are either: 

Completely ignorant and do not realize that what they are doing is haram. In this case there is the hope that there will be no blame on such people.
Or they know but they are deliberately going astray and leading others astray. Such a person is undoubtedly a sinner and will also bear the burden of the sins of those who follow his example.
Or they are unaware and are negligent, not caring to ask people who know. There is the fear that these people may be sinning because of their carelessness and their failure to ask.

These are the errors that we have noticed during tawaf. We hope that Allah will guide our Muslim brothers to put things right so that their tawaf will be in accordance with the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), for the best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Religion is not based on emotions and inclinations, rather it is to be based on what has been narrated from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
And Allah knows best.",From Daleel al-Akhta’ allati yaqa’ fiha al-Haaj wa’l-Mu’tamir by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him)
34647,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34647,The reason why jihaad is prescribed,Why do Muslims wage jihad?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Allaah has enjoined jihad for His sake upon the Muslims, for the great benefits that result from that and because of the harm caused by abandoning jihad.
Some of the reasons why jihad for the sake of Allaah is prescribed in Islam are as follows: 
1 – The main goal of jihad is to make the people worship Allaah alone and to bring them forth from servitude to people to servitude to the Lord of people. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And fight them until there is no more Fitnah (disbelief and worshipping of others along with Allaah) and (all and every kind of) worship is for Allaah (Alone). But if they cease, let there be no transgression except against Az-Zaalimoon (the polytheists, and wrong-doers)”
[al-Baqarah 2:193] 
“And fight them until there is no more Fitnah (disbelief and polytheism, i.e. worshipping others besides Allaah), and the religion (worship) will all be for Allaah Alone [in the whole of the world]. But if they cease (worshipping others besides Allaah), then certainly, Allaah is All-Seer of what they do”
[al-Anfaal 8:39]
Ibn Jareer said:  
So fight them until there is no more shirk, and none is worshipped except Allaah alone with no partner or associate, and trials and calamities, which are disbelief and polytheism, are lifted from the slaves of Allaah on earth, and religion is all for Allaah alone, and so that obedience and worship will be devoted to Him alone and none else. 
Ibn Katheer said: Allaah commands us to fight the kuffaar so that there will be no fitnah, i.e., shirk, and the religion will all be for Allaah alone, i.e., the religion of Allaah will prevail over all other religions. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “""I have been commanded (by Allaah) to fight the people until they testify that there is no god but Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah, and they establish regular prayer and pay zakaah, then if they do that, then they save their lives and property from me except for Islamic laws and then their reckoning will be with Allaah."" Narrated by al-Bukhaari (24), Muslim (33). 
And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “I have been sent just before the Hour with the sword, so that Allaah will be worshipped alone with no partner or associate.”
Narrated by Ahmad, 4869; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 2831. 
This purpose of jihad was present in the minds of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) during their battles with the enemies of Allaah. Al-Bukhaari (2925) narrated that Jubayr ibn Hayyah said: ‘Umar sent people to all the regions to fight the mushrikeen… so ‘Umar recruited us and appointed al-Nu’maan ibn Muqarrin to lead us. When we were in the land of the enemy, the representative of Chosroes came out to us with forty thousand troops. An interpreter stood up and said: “Let one of you speak to me.” Al-Mugheerah said: “Ask whatever you want.” He asked, “Who are you?” He (al-Mugheerah) said: “We are some people from among the Arabs. We used to lead a harsh and miserable life, sucking on animal skins and date stones because of hunger, wearing clothes made of camel and goat hair, worshipping trees and rocks. While we were in this state, the Lord of the heavens and the earth, exalted be His name and glorified be His greatness, sent to us a Prophet from amongst ourselves, whose father and mother we know. Our Prophet, the Messenger of our Lord, (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), commanded us to fight you until you worship Allaah alone or pay the jizyah. Our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us the message from our Lord, that whoever among us is killed will go to Paradise to enjoy delights such as no one has ever seen, and whoever among us is left will become your master.” 
This is the truth that the Sahaabah and leaders of the Muslims proclaimed in their military campaigns. 
Rab’i ibn ‘Aamir said, when Rustam the commander of the Persian armies asked him, “Why have you come?”: “Allaah has sent us to bring forth whomsoever He wills from the worship of man to the worship of Allaah.  
When ‘Uqbah ibn Naafi’ reached Tangiers, he rode his horse into the water until the water was up to its chest, then he said: “O Allaah, bear witness that I have done my utmost, and were it not for this sea I would have travelled throughout the land fighting those who disbelieve in You, until none is worshipped except You.” 
2 – Repelling the aggression of those who attack the Muslims. 
The scholars are unanimously agreed that repelling the aggression of those who attack the Muslims is fard ‘ayn (an individual obligation) upon those who are able to do that. 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And fight in the way of Allaah those who fight you, but transgress not the limits. Truly, Allaah likes not the transgressors”
[al-Baqarah 2:190] 
“Will you not fight a people who have violated their oaths (pagans of Makkah) and intended to expel the Messenger while they did attack you first? Do you fear them? Allaah has more right that you should fear Him if you are believers”
[al-Tawbah 9:13]
3 – Removing fitnah (tribulation) 
Fitnah is of different types: 
(i)That which is caused by the kuffaar who persecute the Muslims or apply pressure to them to make them give up their religion. Allaah has commanded the Muslims to fight in jihad in order to save those who are weak and oppressed. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And what is wrong with you that you fight not in the Cause of Allaah, and for those weak, ill-treated and oppressed among men, women, and children, whose cry is: “Our Lord! Rescue us from this town whose people are oppressors; and raise for us from You one who will protect, and raise for us from You one who will help”
[al-Nisa’ 4:75]
(ii)The fitnah of the kuffaar themselves and their preventing others from hearing and accepting the truth. That is because the kaafir systems corrupt the innate nature and reason of people, and make them get used to worshipping and submitting to things other than Allaah, getting addicted to alcohol, wallowing in the mire of sexual licence, and losing all characteristics of virtue. Whoever is like that can rarely tell truth from falsehood, good from evil, right from wrong. So jihad is prescribed in order to remove those obstacles that prevent people from hearing and accepting the truth and getting to know it.
4 – Protecting the Islamic state from the evil of the kuffaar. 
Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) ordered that the leaders of the kuffaar be killed, those who incited the enemies against the Muslims, such as the Jews Ka’b ibn al-Ashraf and Ibn Abi’l-Haqeeq. 
Another aspect of jihad is to protect the borders against the kuffaar. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) encouraged that as he said: “Guarding the border for one day for the sake of Allaah is better than this world and everything in it.” Al-Bukhaari, 2678. 
5 – Frightening the kuffaar, humiliating them and putting them to shame. 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Fight against them so that Allaah will punish them by your hands and disgrace them and give you victory over them and heal the breasts of a believing people,
 And remove the anger of their (believers’) hearts. Allaah accepts the repentance of whom He wills. Allaah is All-Knowing, All-Wise”
[al-Tawbah 9:14-15] 
 
“And make ready against them all you can of power, including steeds of war (tanks, planes, missiles, artillery) to threaten the enemy of Allaah and your enemy”
[al-Anfaal 8:60]
Hence it is prescribed to fight in a manner that will strike terror into the heart of the enemy. 
Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah – may Allaah have mercy on him] was asked whether it is permissible for a soldier to wear silk or gold or silver when fighting or when the envoys of the enemy come to the Muslims. 
He replied: 
With regard to wearing silk in order to frighten the enemy, there are two scholarly views, the more correct of which is that it is allowed. The soldiers of Syria wrote to ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab saying: “When we met the enemy we saw that they had covered their weapons with silk and we found that this struck terror in our hearts.” ‘Umar wrote back to them saying: “You should cover your weapons as they do.” And wearing silk is a kind of showing off, and Allaah likes showing off at the time of fighting, as it is narrated in al-Sunan that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is a kind of showing off that Allaah likes, and a kind of showing off that Allaah hates. The showing off that Allaah likes is when a man shows off at the time of war. The kind of showing off that Allaah hates is showing off for the purpose of pride and boasting.” On the day of Uhud, Abu Dujaanah al-Ansaari showed off among the ranks, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “This is a kind of walking that Allaah hates except in this situation.” Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 28/17 
6 – Exposing the hypocrites 
Allaah says (Interpretation of the meaning): 
“But when a decisive Soorah (explaining and ordering things) is sent down, and fighting (Jihaad — holy fighting in Allaah’s Cause) is mentioned (i.e. ordained) therein, you will see those in whose hearts is a disease (of hypocrisy) looking at you with a look of one fainting to death”
[Muhammad 47:20]
At times of ease and plenty, the Muslims may be joined by those who seek to make worldly gains, and they do not want to make the word of Allaah prevail over the word of kufr. These people may conceal their real nature from many of the Muslims, and the most effective means of exposing them is jihad, because jihad means sacrificing oneself but these hypocrites are only indulging in hypocrisy in order to save themselves.  
Exposing the hypocrites was one of the major purposes that Allaah wanted the believers to achieve on the day of Uhud. 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allaah will not leave the believers in the state in which you are now, until He distinguishes the wicked from the good”
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:179]
Ibn al-Qayyim said:  
This means: Allaah will not leave you in the state in which you are, where the believers are indistinguishable from the hypocrites, until the believers are made distinct from the hypocrites, as they were distinguished by the test on the day of Uhud, and Allaah will not disclose to you the unseen matters by which the one group is distinguished from the other, for they are distinguished from one another in the knowledge of the unseen that He has, but He wants to distinguish them from one another in a clear and visible manner, so that His unseen knowledge will become known and visible. 
7 – Purifying the believers of their sins and ridding them thereof 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And so are the days (good and not so good), that We give to men by turns, that Allaah may test those who believe, and that He may take martyrs from among you. And Allaah likes not the Zaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers).
 And that Allaah may test (or purify) the believers (from sins) and destroy the disbelievers.
 
Do you think that you will enter Paradise before Allaah tests those of you who fought (in His Cause) and (also) tests those who are As-Saabiroon (the patient)?”
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:140-142]
8 – Acquiring booty 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “I have been sent ahead of the Hour with the sword so that Allaah will be worshipped alone, and my provision has been placed in the shade of my spear, and humiliation has been decreed for those who go against my command, and whoever imitates a people is one of them.”  Narrated by Ahmad, 4869; Saheeh al-Jaami’, 2831. 
Al-Haafiz said: 
This hadeeth indicates that war booty is permissible for this ummah, and that the provision of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) has been placed in war booty and not in other kinds of earnings. Hence some of the scholars said that it is the best kind of earnings. 
Al-Qurtubi said: 
Allaah sent provision to His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) by means of his striving and He made it by means of the best kind of striving which is earning it by means of force and strength. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) went out for the battle of Badr to meet the caravan of Abu Sufyaan. 
Al-Qurtubi said: The fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) went out to meet the caravan indicates that it is permissible to take booty because it is a halaal source of income. This refutes Maalik’s view that this is makrooh, when he said that this was fighting for worldly gains.  
Al-Shawkaani said: Ibn Abi Jamrah said: The scholars of hadeeth are of the view that if the primary motive is to make the word of Allaah supreme, it does not matter what else is also achieved. 
9 – Taking martyrs. 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“If a wound (and killing) has touched you, be sure a similar wound (and killing) has touched the others. And so are the days (good and not so good), that We give to men by turns, that Allaah may test those who believe, and that He may take martyrs from among you. And Allaah likes not the Zaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers).
 And that Allaah may test (or purify) the believers (from sins) and destroy the disbelievers”
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:140-141]
Martyrdom is one of the highest statuses before Allaah, and the martyrs are the closest of His slaves to Him. There is no status higher than that of siddeeq apart from martyrdom. Allaah loves to take martyrs from among His slaves, who shed their blood for His love and to earn His pleasure, preferring His pleasure and His love above themselves. There is no way to attain this status except by circumstances that may lead to it such as enemies coming against the Muslims.  
This was said by Ibn al-Qayyim in Zaad al-Ma’aad. 
This is the great wisdom and  those who try to put the Muslims off jihad and make them fear it, and say that jihad is no more than death, and making women widows and children orphans, pale into insignificance. 
10 – Ridding the world of corruption. 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“For had it not been that Allaah checks one set of people by means of another, monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques, wherein the Name of Allaah is mentioned much would surely, have been pulled down. Verily, Allaah will help those who help His (Cause). Truly, Allaah is All-Strong, All-Mighty”
[al-Hajj 22:40] 
“And if Allaah did not check one set of people by means of another, the earth would indeed be full of mischief. But Allaah is full of bounty to the ‘Aalameen (mankind, jinn and all that exists)”
[al-Baqarah 2:251]
Muqaatil said: 
Were it not that Allaah checked the mushriks by means of the Muslims, the mushriks would have overrun the earth and killed the Muslims and destroyed the mosques. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in al-Jawaab al-Saheeh, 2/216: 
So the kuffar are repelled by means of the Muslims and the worse of the two parties is repelled by the better, just as the Magians (Persians) were repelled by the Christian Byzantines, then the Christians were repelled by the believers of the ummah of Muhammad. 
Al-Sa’di said: The world would be corrupted if the kuffaar and evildoers were to prevail. 
 
These are some of the reasons why jihad is prescribed.
We ask Allaah to bring the Muslims back to their religion. May Allaah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad.",Islam Q&A
34648,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34648,He is denying the torment of the grave on the grounds that if he were to open a grave he would not see any change,How should we respond to one who denies the torment of the grave on the grounds that if he were to open a grave he would not see any change or notice that it has been made constricted or widened?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: One who denies the torment of the grave on the grounds that if he were to open a grave he would not see any change may be answered on several points, including the following: 
Firstly: 
The torment of the grave is proven according to sharee’ah. Allaah says concerning the people of Pharaoh (interpretation of the meaning): 
 
“The Fire, they are exposed to it, morning and afternoon. And on the Day when the Hour will be established (it will be said to the angels): ‘Cause Fir‘awn’s (Pharaoh) people to enter the severest torment!’”
[Ghaafir 40:46]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Were it not that you would not bury one another, I would have asked Allaah to make you hear the torment of the grave that I can hear.” Then he turned to us and said: “Seek refuge with Allaah from the torment of the Fire,” and they said, “We seek refuge with Allaah from the torment of the Fire.” He said, “Seek refuge with Allaah from the torment of the grave,” and they said, “We seek refuge with Allaah from the torment of the grave.” Narrated by Muslim, 2867. 
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said concerning the believer: “His grave will be made spacious for him, as far as the eye can see.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1374; Muslim, 2870. 
And there are other texts too. 
So it is not permissible to object to or reject these texts because of our mistaken notions, rather we must believe them and submit. 
Secondly: 
The torment of the grave happens to the soul, and it is not something that has a physical effect. If it had a physical effect it would not be the matter of belief in the unseen and believing in it would not serve any purpose. But it is one of the matters of the unseen, and the way things are in al-Barzakh cannot be compared to the way things are in this world. 
Thirdly: 
Torment and blessing, and whether the grave is widened or constricted, are matters that the deceased feels but others do not. A man may see in his dream, whilst he is lying on his bed, that he is standing and coming and going, hitting or being hit. He may see himself in a confined and frightening place, or in a spacious and pleasant place, but those around him cannot see or feel that.  
What we are obliged to do regarding such matters is to say “We hear and obey, and we believe and affirm.”","Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him), 2/29"
34649,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34649,The reason why the torment of the grave is hidden from man,Is the torment of the grave one of the matters of the unseen or of the seen world? What is the reason why it is made one of the matters of the unseen?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
The torment of the grave is one of the matters of the unseen. How many people in these graves are being tormented but we do not realize it, and how many of their neighbours are being blessed with a door opened for them to Paradise, but we do not realize it? What is beneath the graves is known only to the Knower of the Unseen. The torment of the grave is one of the matters of the unseen, and were it not for the revelation that came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), we would not know anything about it. Hence when the Jewish woman entered upon ‘Aa’ishah and told her that the dead are tormented in the grave, she was alarmed, until the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came and she told him, and he confirmed that. But Allah may cause whomsoever He wills of His slaves to see that, as He caused His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to see the two men who were being punished, one for going about spreading malicious gossip, and the other for not taking precautions to protect himself from urine. 
The reasons why this is one of the matters of the unseen are as follows: 
1 – Allah is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy, for if we were to see the torment of the grave this would make our lives a misery, because if a person were to know that his father or brother or son or spouse or relative is being punished in the grave and he is not able to save him, then he would be distressed and unable to relax. So this is a blessing from Allah.  
2 – It would be a scandal for the deceased. If Allah had concealed him and we did not know his sins, which were a matter between him and his Lord, then he died and Allah showed us his torment, that would be a great scandal for him. So concealing him is a mercy from Allah towards the deceased. 
3 – It might become difficult to bury the dead, as it was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Were it not that you would not bury one another, I would have asked Allah to make you hear the torment of the grave.” Narrated by Muslim, 2868. 
This indicates that burial might become too difficult and people would not do it, even though if a person deserves to be punished he will be punished even if he is lying on the surface of the earth. But people might imagine that the torment only takes place when the person is buried, so they would not bury one another. 
4 – If it were visible, belief in it would serve no purpose, because it would be visible and no one could deny it. And this might force all people to believe, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So when they saw Our punishment, they said: We believe in Allah Alone” [Ghaafir 40:84]
So if the people saw those who had been buried and heard their screams, they would believe and none of them would disbelieve, because he would be certain that the torment is real and he would see it with his own eyes as if it were happening to him. 
But the wisdom of Allah is great, and the true believer is the one who believes with certainty what Allah tells him more than what he sees with his own eyes, because what Allah tells us cannot be subject to confusion or lies, but what the eyes see may be imaginary. How many people have sworn that they have seen the new crescent moon, when it was in fact a star; how many people have seen the new moon and it turned out to be a white hair on his eyebrow; how many have seen a shadow and said that it was a person coming towards him, but it turned out to be the trunk of a palm tree; how many people have seen a stationery object moving and a moving object standing still.

34651,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34651,Mutawaatir hadith,What is the ruling on mutawaatir hadith in Islam?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Mutawaatir is an Arabic word that is derived from the word tawaatur, which means succession, one after the other. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Then We sent Our Messengers in succession”
[al-Mu’minoon 23:44]
What this means in sharee’ah terminology is a report which was narrated by a group who could not possibly have agreed upon a lie, from a similar group, and which is based on what they saw or heard. 
The scholars have mentioned four conditions for a hadith to be regarded as mutawaatir: 
1 – It should have been narrated by a large number
2 – The number should be so large that it is impossible that they could have agreed upon a lie.
3 – There should be a large number of narrators at every stage of the chain of narration (isnaad), so it should have been narrated by a large number from a large number, all the way back to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).
4 – It should be based on what they saw or heard, so they should say, “We heard” or “We saw”, because if it is not like that it is possible for error to creep in, so it is not mutawaatir. 
With regard to the types of mutawaatir, these are: 
1 – Mutawaatir in the wording –  
For example: 
“Whoever tells a lie against me deliberately, let him take his place in Hell.” 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 107; Muslim, 3; Abu Dawood, 3651; al-Tirmidhi, 2661; Ibn Maajah, 30, 37; and Ahmad, 2/159. 
This hadith was narrated by more than seventy-two Sahaabah, and was narrated from them by a huge number of narrators whom it is impossible to list. 
2 – Mutawaatir in the meaning – this is where the same meaning is narrated in mutawaatir hadith, but not necessarily in the same wording each time. 
For example: the ahaadeeth about raising the hands when making du’aa’. Nearly one hundred ahaadeeth are narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in each of which it says that he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) raised his hands when making du’aa’. Al-Suyooti compiled them in a chapter which he entitled Fadd al-Wi’aa’ fi Ahaadeeth Raf’ al-Yadayn fi’l-Du’aa’. 
With regard to the ruling on mutawaatir reports: a mutawaatir report must be accepted, because it is definitive and certain, even if there is no other corroborating evidence. And there is no need to examine the biographies of its narrators. This is a matter concerning which no wise man will have any doubts.

“And marry those among you who are single (i.e. a man who has no wife and the woman who has no husband) and (also marry) the Saalihoon (pious, fit and capable ones) of your (male) slaves and maid-servants (female slaves). If they be poor, Allah will enrich them out of His Bounty” [al-Noor 24:32]
And it was enjoined by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ood (may Allah be pleased with him) said:  The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “O young men, whoever among you can afford it, let him get married, for it is more effective in lowering the gaze and guarding one’s chastity. And whoever cannot afford it, let him fast, for it will be a shield for him.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5065; Muslim, 1400. 
And there is the story of the three men who came to ask about the worship of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). When they were told about it, it was as if they thought it was not much. One of them said, “I keep away from women and I will never get married.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to this man and to his companions that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) fasted and broke his fast, he stayed up praying and slept, and he married women. Then he said: “Whoever turns away from my Sunnah is not of me.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5063; Muslim, 1401.

They vary in the extent to which they do that. In some cases most of the person’s wealth comes from haraam sources and in some cases only a little of his earning is haraam. Is it permissible for us Muslims to mix with them and eat their food if they invite us? Is it permissible for us to accept their donations from this wealth for the mosque?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly:  
You have to advise them and warn them of the 
    evil consequences of dealing in haraam things and earning money from haraam sources. You should cooperate with your brothers in reminding them and 
    warning them of the punishment of Allaah and how severely He deals with those who disobey Him. You should tell them that the pleasures of this 
    world are insignificant, and that the Hereafter is better and more lasting. If they respond, then praise be to Allaah, and they will become 
    thereby your brothers in Islam. Then you should advise them to restore the rights of those whom they have wronged, if they know who they are, and 
    to follow up bad deeds with good, so that Allaah may accept their repentance and turn their bad deeds into good. In that case it will be 
    permissible for you to mix with them as brothers and to eat their food, and to accept their donations for building and furnishing the mosque, etc, 
    because by repenting and restoring people’s rights it is possible that they may be forgiven for what they did in the past, because Allaah says 
    concerning those who deal in riba [usury] (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So 
    whosoever receives an admonition from his Lord and stops consuming Ribaa, shall not be punished for the past”
[al-Baqarah 2:275]
Secondly: 
If they refuse to heed the advice and reminders, and they persist in their haraam actions,

    hope that they will give up their evil ways.

What is the evidence for that?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
We have already discussed the issue of naafil prayers at times when prayer is forgiven. Please se questions no. 306, 8818 and 20013. 
Secondly: 
The prostration of recitation is not prayer according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions. We have already discussed this in questions no. 4913 and 22650. 
Based on this, it is permissible to prostrate when reading one of the Qur’aanic verses where prostration is required at times when prayer is not allowed, according to the more correct of the two scholarly views, because that does not come under the same rulings as prayer. Even if we assume that it does come under the same rulings as prayer, it is permissible to do it at times when prayer is otherwise not allowed because it is something that is done for a reason, like the eclipse prayer, and the two rak’ahs following tawaaf if one has done tawaaf at a time when prayer is not allowed. 
Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 7/264. 
Thirdly: 
Your saying, “the two rak'ahs for seeking forgiveness”; perhaps what you mean is the two rak’ahs of repentance, which are prescribed when repenting from sin. It was narrated that Abu Bakrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “There is no man who commits a sin then he gets up, purifies himself and prays two rak’ahs, then asks Allaah to forgive him, but Allaah will forgive him.” Then he recited this verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And those who, when they have committed Faahishah (illegal sexual intercourse) or wronged themselves with evil, remember Allaah and ask forgiveness for their sins; — and none can forgive sins but Allaah — and do not persist in what (wrong) they have done, while they know”
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:135]
Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 408; Abu Dawood, 1521; Ibn Maajah, 1395. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 1346. 
The two rak’ahs of repentance constitute a prayer for which there is a reason, so it is permissible to do that at a time when prayer is otherwise not allowed. And Allaah knows best. 
In other saheeh reports there are other descriptions of the two rak’ahs which expiate for sin. This may be summed up as follows: 
-There is no one who does wudoo’ and does it well (because sins come out from the washed limbs with the water or with the last drop of water)
Part of doing wudoo’ well is to say Bismillaah (In the name of Allaah) before starting it, and reciting dhikr after it, as follows: Ashhadu an laa ilaaha ill-Allaah wahdahu laa shareeka lah, wa ashhadu anna Muhammadan ‘abduhu wa rasooluhu. Allaahumma aj’alni min al-tawwaabeena waj’alni min al-mutatahhareen. Subhaanaka Allaahumma wa bi hamdika, ashhadu an laa ilaaha illa anta, astaghfiruka wa atoobu ilayk (I bear witness that there is no god but Allaah alone, with no partner or associate, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger. O Allaah, make me one of those who repent and make me one of the purified. Glory and praise be to You, O Allaah, I bear witness that there is no god but You, I seek Your forgiveness and I repent to You). This dhikr recited after wudoo’ brings a great reward. 
-Then he gets up and prays two rak’ahs
-In which he does not make any mistake
-And does not let his mind wander
-And he remembers Allaah and focuses with proper humility
-Then he asks Allaah to forgive him
The outcome will be: that he is forgiven for his previous sins and will deserve Paradise.

    internet cafes unless they are free of evils, which includes not allowing the visitors to go to haraam websites, by denying them access to such

    help one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allaah. Verily, Allaah is Severe in punishment”

    from their reward in the slightest, and whoever calls others to misguidance will have a burden of sin like that of those who follow him without 
    that detracting from their sins in the slightest.” Narrated by Muslim, 2674.

Is this view correct? 
If it is correct, then can we draw the analogy from this that it is permissible to sell cigarettes, tobacco, women’s pants and revealing swimsuits for men and women, even though Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Help you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression”

I hope you can explain. May Allaah bless you and keep you.",,,"Praise be to Allah.This hadeeth was narrated by al-Bukhaari (2104) and Muslim (2068) and others, in several places and via several isnaads. For example, al-Bukhaari narrated it under the heading Baab al-Tijaarah fima yukrah libsuhu li’l-rijaali wa’l-nisa’ (Chapter on dealing in things that are makrooh for men and women), via Saalim ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar from his father, who said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sent a hullah (garment) of silk and he saw him wearing it and said, “I did not send it to you for you to wear it, for the one who wears it is one who has no share (in the Hereafter). Rather I sent it to you so that you could make use of it,” i.e., sell it. 
This hadeeth indicates that it is permissible to deal in clothes that may be used in one way but not in another, and it is permissible to give them to others, and the one who buys such a thing or to whom it is given has to use it in ways that are permissible, not in ways that are forbidden. Examples of that include gold jewellery, weapons, knives, grapes and other things that may be used for halaal or haraam purposes. It is permissible to deal in them and to give them to others. 
The one who buys or is given such things must use them in ways that are permissible, such as selling them, giving them as gifts, etc; he should not use them in any way that is forbidden. 
But if the thing is something that is forbidden to use in any way, then it is not permissible to deal in it or to give it as a gift, such as pigs, lions and wolves. There is nothing in the hadeeth to suggest that it is permissible to sell the things mentioned in the question, so it is not valid to draw an analogy between selling cigarettes, tobacco and revealing swimsuits for men and woman and selling things that may be used in one way but not another, or under some circumstances but not others, because it is haraam to use them in all circumstances.

Similarly is it permissible to be alone with them or not? 

Is the temporary prohibition on marriage between a man and his wife’s sister or aunt the same as the temporary prohibition on marriage between a man and another man's wife or not?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
It is not permissible for a man to shake hands with his wife’s sister or aunt, and it is not

    not enough to make them like mahrams with regard to being alone and shaking hands with them. 
Secondly: 
If it is established that a person is a 
    mahram through blood ties, breastfeeding or ties of marriage, then that is permanent. There is no such thing as a temporary mahram, rather there 
    is a temporary prohibition on marriage. The wife’s sister or aunt are not mahrams of a man, rather it is haraam for him to marry any of them

“Forbidden to you (for marriage) are: your 
    mothers, … and two sisters in wedlock at the same time”
[al-Nisa’ 4:23]
And because the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade being married to a woman and her aunt at the same time. With regard to the wife of another man, she is 
    temporarily forbidden to anyone other than her husband, so long as she is still married to him. If the marriage ends through his death or through

It is mustahabb to make du`a’ when prostrating, reciting whatever you can of the du`a’s prescribed in sharee’ah, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:  “When bowing glorify your Lord, and when prostrating strive in making du`a’, for then you are more likely to receive an answer.”

When you say the tashahhud in the last prayer, then praise Allah and send blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), then prostrate and recite the Opening of the Book (Surah al-Fatihah) seven times whilst prostrating, and say, ‘La ilaha ill-Allah wahdahu la shareeka lah, lahu’l-mulk wa lahu’l-hamd wa huwa ‘ala kulli shay’in qadeer (There is no god but Allah alone, with no partner or associate; to Him belongs all sovereignty and to Him be praise, and He is Able to do all things),’ ten times.

He said, It was narrated only by ‘Amir ibn Khadash al-Nisapuri. He said: our shaykh, al-Hafiz Abu’l-Hasan said: he was a narrator of munkar (rejected) reports. He was the only one who narrated it from ‘Umar ibn Haroon al-Balkhi, who is matrook and mutahham (i.e., his hadeeths are rejected), and only Ibn Mahdi praised him. 
Hence it is known that this hadeeth is da’eef (weak) from the point of view of its isnad (chain of narrators). 
Moreover, the saheeh ahadeeth (authentic narrations) indicate that it is not allowed to recite Quran when prostrating, so the hadeeth is also weak from the point of view of its text. It is not permissible to act upon it because it is not saheeh (sound) and because it contradicts the saheeh ahadeeth.

34694,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34694,"How will the kaafir be brought to account in the Hereafter, when he is not required to adhere to sharee’ah?","How will the kaafir be brought to account on the Day of Resurrection, when he is not required to adhere to sharee’ah?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
This question is based on an incorrect understanding, because the kaafir is subject to the same requirements as the believer, but he is not obliged to follow them in this world. The fact that this is required of him is indicated by the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Except those on the Right (i.e. the pious true believers of Islamic Monotheism).
In Gardens (Paradise) they will ask one another,
About Al‑Mujrimoon (polytheists, criminals, disbelievers) (and they will say to them):
‘What has caused you to enter Hell?’
They will say: ‘We were not of those who used to offer the Salaah (prayers)
Nor we used to feed Al‑Miskeen (the poor);
And we used to talk falsehood (all that which Allaah hated) with vain talkers.
And we used to belie the Day of Recompense’”
[al-Muddaththir 74:39]
If they would not be punished for not praying and not feeding the poor, etc, the verse would not have mentioned these things. This indicates that they will be punished with regard to minor issues of Islam. As this is proven in the texts, it is also indicated by rational thinking, because if Allaah will punish His believing slave for his shortcomings with regard to the obligations of his religion, how can He not then punish the kaafir? 
Moreover, the kaafir will be punished for all the blessings that Allaah bestowed upon him of food, drink and other things. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Those who believe and do righteous good deeds, there is no sin on them for what they ate (in the past), if they fear Allaah (by keeping away from His forbidden things), and believe and do righteous good deeds, and again fear Allaah and believe, and once again fear Allaah and do good deeds with Ihsaan (perfection). And Allaah loves the good‑doers”
[al-Maa'idah 5:93]
 The wording of this verse states that the believers will be spared any blame for what they ate, which implies that the kaafirs will be subjected to blame for what they ate. Similarly Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say (O Muhammad): ‘Who has forbidden the adornment with clothes given by Allaah, which He has produced for His slaves, and At-Tayyibaat [all kinds of Halaal (lawful) things] of food?’ Say: ‘They are, in the life of this world, for those who believe, (and) exclusively for them (believers) on the Day of Resurrection (the disbelievers will not share them)’”
[al-A’raaf 7:32]
The words “They are, in the life of this world, for those who believe” in this verse indicate that non-believers have no right to enjoy them in this world – i.e., they have no rights according to sharee’ah, but according to real life as Allaah has decreed it to be, Allaah has created these blessings and the kaafirs are benefitting from them, and this is something that no one can deny. This indicates that the kaafir will be brought to account for what he ate of permissible things and what he wore. What is implied by the text is also implied by reason, otherwise how could this kaafir who disobeys Allaah and does not believe in Him deserve to enjoy that which Allaah has created and has bestowed upon His slaves? If this is clear to you then the kaafir will also be brought to account on the Day of Resurrection for his deeds, but the reckoning of the kaafir on the Day of Resurrection will not be like the reckoning of the believer, because the believer’s reckoning will be easy; his Lord will address him in secret and will tell him of his sins until he confesses, then He will say to him, “I concealed them for you in the world and I forgive you for them this Day.” But for the kaafir – we seek refuge with Allaah – his reckoning will involve his being told of his sins and being disgraced in front of the witnesses: 
“and the witnesses will say, ‘These are the ones who lied against their Lord!’ No doubt! the Curse of Allaah is on the Zaalimoon (polytheists, wrongdoers, oppressors)”

Is what I did correct? What should I have done?","The majority of scholars are of the view that wudu is an essential condition of tawaf. However, wudu is not essential for sa`i.","Is tawaf without ablution valid?

Is wudu necessary for sa`i?","Praise be to Allah.Is tawaf without ablution valid?
You did well by renewing your wudu and repeating your tawaf. You did that which is better and more on the safe side. The majority of scholars are of the view that taharah (being pure, i.e., having wudu) is an essential condition of tawaf, like prayer, being valid. Just as prayer is not valid unless one has done wudu, so too tawaf is not valid without wudu. 
Ibn Qudamah said: 
“Taharah (being pure, having wudu) is a condition of tawaf being valid. This is the well-known view of Ahmad, and it is the view of Malik and al-Shafi'i.”
Evidence for wudu being a condition for tawaf
The majority of scholars quote several pieces of evidence to support this view, such as the following: 

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Tawaf around the House is (a kind of) prayer, except that you may speak during it.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 960; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Irwa al-Ghalil, 121) 
It is proven in al-Sahihayn that ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “When he [the Prophet] (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wanted to do tawaf, he did wudu.” And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Learn from me your rituals (of Hajj and ‘Umrah).” (Narrated by Muslim, 1297) (Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 17/213-214)
It was proven in al-Sahihayn that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to ‘Aishah when her menses came: “Do what the pilgrims do, but do not circumambulate the House until you are pure [i.e., until your period ends].” 

Any expiation for making tawaf without wudu?
Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: I have a female relative who did ‘Umrah during Ramadan and when she entered the Haram she broke her wudu by passing wind, but she felt too embarrassed to tell her family that she wanted to do wudu. Then she did tawaf and when she finished tawaf she went off by herself and did wudu, then she did sa’i. Does she have to offer a sacrifice or any expiation (kaffarah)? 
He replied: 
“Her tawaf is not valid, because one of the conditions of tawaf being valid is taharah (purity), as in the case of prayer. So she should go back to Makkah and circumambulate the House. It is also recommended for her to repeat sa’i, because most of the scholars are of the view that it is not permissible to do sa’i before tawaf. Then she should cut some hair from all parts of her head and exit ihram. If she has a husband who had intercourse with her, then she has to slaughter a sheep in Makkah to be distributed to the poor, and she has to do another ‘Umrah from the miqat from which she entered ihram for the first ‘umrah, because the first ‘umrah was invalidated by that intercourse. She should do what we have mentioned, then do another ‘Umrah from the mهqat from which she entered ihram for the first ‘umrah, whether she does that now or at another time, depending on her ability. And Allah is the source of strength.” (Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 17/214-215)
He was also asked: 
A man started to do tawaf, then he passed wind. Does he have to stop his tawaf or should he continue? 
He replied: 
“If a person passes wind or urine or semen, or he touches his private part, etc. during tawaf, then he should stop his tawaf, as (he is required to do if any of these things happen) in the case of prayer. He should go and purify himself, then start tawaf again. This is the correct view; there is a difference of scholarly opinion concerning this matter, but this is the correct view concerning both prayer and tawaf, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If one of you breaks wind silently during prayer, let him go and do wudu then repeat the prayer.” Narrated by Abu Dawud and classed as sahih by Ibn Khuzaymah. Tawaf comes under the same heading as prayer in general…” (Majmu’ Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 17/216-217)
Some of the scholars are of the view that purity from hadath (minor impurity) is not essential for tawaf. This is the view of Abu Hanifah (may Allah have mercy on him) and was the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah. They responded to the evidence quoted in support of the first view in the following manner: 
With regard to the hadith: “Tawaf around the House is (a kind of) prayer”, they said that this is not a sahih report from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), rather these are the words of Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him). Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmu’: The correct view is that this is a mawquf report which stops at Ibn 'Abbas. This was mentioned by al-Bayhaqi and other scholars of hadith. 
With regard to the actions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his doing tawaf in a state of taharah (purity), they said: This does not indicate that it is obligatory, rather it only indicates that it is recommended, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did that, but it is not reported that he commanded his Companions to do that. 
With regard to the Prophet’s saying to ‘Aishah: “Do what the pilgrims do, but do not circumambulate the House until you are pure [i.e., until your period ends],” the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told her not to do tawaf because she was menstruating, and the menstruating woman is forbidden to enter the mosque. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: 
“Those who say that it is obligatory to have wudu in order to do tawaf have no proof at all, because no one narrated, with either a sahih isnad or a da’if one, that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoined having wudu in order to do tawaf. It should be noted that very many people did Hajj with him, and he did ‘Umrah numerous times and the people did ‘Umrah with him. If wudu were obligatory for tawaf, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would have pointed that out to everyone, and if he had stated that, then the Muslims would have transmitted it from him and would not have been negligent concerning that.  But it is proven in al-Sahih that when he did tawaf he did wudu. This on its own does not indicate that it is obligatory, for he used to do wudu for each prayer and he said: “I do not like to remember Allah except in a state of purity.”  (Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 21/273)
Even though this view –that taharah is not an essential condition for tawaf – has some strength and the evidence may be interpreted in this manner, people should not start tawaf without being in a state of purity, because it is undoubtedly better to do tawaf in a state of purity; that is more on the safe side and by doing that one will avoid going against the view of the majority of scholars. 
But a person may do that if it is too difficult to keep or repeat one's wudu, such as during the days of Hajj, or if a person is sick or elderly and it is hard to keep his wudu as well as deal with the crowds and so on. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said, after responding to the evidence quoted by the majority: 
“Based on this, the more correct view which gives peace of mind is that it is not essential to be pure from minor impurity (i.e., have wudu) in order to do tawaf, but it is undoubtedly better and is following the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and no one should neglect purity and go against the majority of scholars in this matter. But sometimes one is compelled to follow the view of Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, such as if a person breaks his wudu when there is too much crowding, in which case the view that he has to go and do wudu and come back in this severe crowding, especially when he only has a few circuits left, will cause too much hardship. With regard to matters which cause too much hardship and regarding which there is no clear text, we should not force people to adhere to them, rather we should follow that which is more lenient, because forcing people do things that are too hard with no clear proof contradicts what Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you.” [al-Baqarah 2:185] (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 7/300)
Is wudu necessary for sa`i?
With regard to sa’i, it is not essential to have wudu for sa’i . This is the view of the four Imams, Abu Hanifah, Malik, al-Shafi'i and Ahmad. Indeed it is permissible for menstruating women to perform sa’i between al-Safa and al-Marwah, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) only told menstruating women not to do tawaf, as he said to ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her), when her menses came: “Do what the pilgrims do, but do not circumambulate the House.”  (See al-Mughni, 5/246)
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said: 
“If a person does sa’i when he does not have wudu, or when he is junub [in a state of impurity following sexual activity], or if a woman does sa’i when she is menstruating, then this is valid, but it is better to do sa’i in a state of taharah.”  (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 7/310, 311)
