1103,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1103,Ruling on Intercourse with a Woman in her rectum,"Please accept my apology if this questions offends, but in the pursuit of Islamic knowledge, we cannot afford to be shy for fear that if we are not well advised, we may commit a sin.
I have been advised by a friend that there is a ""qawl"" (opinion) among some ulamaa' (scholars) that it is permissible to conduct anal sex (anal penetration) (between man and wife only) during the time of the wife's haydh (menstruation).
Is this correct?
Please also advise the laws and penalties relevant to it.",,,"Praise be to Allah. 

Your apology is accepted. Striving to understand the rulings of Sharee'ah in this and similar matters is not haraam or shameful; it is necessary.

As regards your question, anal intercourse with one's wife is a major sin, whether it occurs at the time of menstruation or not. The Prophet SAWS (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) cursed the one who does this: ""Cursed is the one who approaches his wife in her rectum"" (Reported by Imaam Ahmad, 2/479; see also Saheeh al-Jaami', 5865).

The Prophet SAWS (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) also said: ""The one who has intercourse with a menstruating woman, or with a woman in her rectum, or who goes to a fortune-teller, has disbelieved in what was revealed to Muhammad."" (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, no. 1/243; see also Saheeh al-Jaami', 5918).

In spite of the fact that many wives of sound nature refuse this, there are some husbands who threaten their wives with divorce if they do not obey them (in this matter), and some even deceive their wives, who are too shy to ask scholars about it, into thinking that it is permissible. The Prophet SAWS (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) said that a man may approach his wife in any way he likes, from the front or the back, so long as intercourse takes place in the place from through which a child is born. There is no doubt that the rectum is the place from which waste matter is expelled, not the place from which a child is born.

Another reason why some may commit this immoral act is that they enter upon what should be a clean married life with some jaahili (ignorant) traditions and odd practices, or with memories of scenes from indecent movies, for which they have not repented to Allaah.

It is known that this act is forbidden even if both partners agree to it. Mutual consent to a haraam deed does not make it halaal.

I ask Allah to bestow upon us a proper understanding of His religion and to make us adhere to its limits, for He is the All-Hearing, the One Who answers prayers.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
1106,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1106,Differences in Prayer for Men and Women,"Is there any prove from the Sunnah or ijtihad of the Sahaba that the praying (salat) 
of a woman is on some points different from the man, like it is in the Hanafi 
madhhab?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
  The general principle is that women are equal to men in all religious rulings, 
  because of the hadeeth ""Women are the twin halves of men"" (Reported 
  by Imaam Ahmad and classified as saheeh in Saheeh al-Jaami’ 1983), except 
  when there is evidence (daleel) of a specific ruling which applies only to women. 
  One of the cases in which the scholars mention specific rules for women is prayer, 
  where there are differences as follows:
Women do not have to give adhaan or iqaamah, 
    because adhaan requires raising the voice, which women are not permitted to 
    do. Ibn Qudaamah, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: ""We know of no 
    difference between the scholars (on this point)."" (Al-Mughni 
    ma’a al-Sharh al-Kabeer, 1/438). 
All of the woman’s body is ‘awrah 
    and must be covered during prayer, except for her face, because the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    ""No prayer will be accepted from an adult woman unless she wears a khimaar 
    (head-cover). (Reported by the five Muhadditheen) 
    There is some dispute as to whether her heels and feet should be covered. 
    The author of al-Mughni (2/328) said: ""As for the rest of the free woman’s 
    body, it must be covered during prayer. If any part becomes uncovered, it 
    renders her prayer invalid, except if only a little bit is uncovered. Maalik, 
    al-Oozaa’i and al-Shaafi’i said the same.
The woman should keep her limbs close 
    to her body during rukoo’ and sujood, and not spread them out, because 
    this is more modest and covering. (Al-Mughni 2/258). Al-Nawawi 
    said: ""Al-Shaafi’i said, in al-Mukhtasar: there is no difference 
    between men and women in prayer, except that women should keep the parts of 
    their bodies close to one another, and they should make their stomachs touch 
    their thighs during sujood. This is more covering and preferable, in rukoo’ 
    and the rest of the prayer too."" (See al-Majmoo’ 
    3/429).
It is preferable for women to pray in 
    congregation, led by one of their number, because the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told Umm Waraqah to lead the women 
    of her household in prayer. There is some difference among scholars on this 
    matter. (See al-Mughni, 2/202 and al-Majmoo’ al-Nawawi, 
    4/84-85). The woman leading the prayer should read aloud 
    as long as no non-mahram man can hear her.
It is permissible for women to go out 
    and pray in the mosque with men, although their prayer at home is better for 
    them, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) said: ""Do not prevent the women from going out 
    to the mosques, even though their homes are better for them."" (For 
    more details on this matter, see Question#973).
Imaam al-Nawawi, may Allaah have mercy 
    on him, said (al-Majmoo’ 3/455): 
    ""Women differ from men in congregational prayer in a number of ways:
(1) Congregational prayer is not required 
    of them in the same way as it is of men.
    (2) The imam of a group of women stands in the middle of the (first) row.
    (3) (If one woman and one man are praying), she should stand behind him, not 
    next to him.
    (4) If women are praying in rows behind men, the back rows are better for 
    them than the front rows.
What we can learn from the above is that 
  women and men are forbidden to mix. Allaah is our Helper and Support.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

I eagerly await your response insha'Allah.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to watch these kinds of movies which tell stories of shirk. Seeing and hearing them can cause serious damage to the heart of the Muslim. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) got angry with Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allah be pleased with him) when he saw him with a piece of the Tawraat (Torah) in his hand, and told him to destroy it. Many of the Muslims do not have sufficient protection or the level of knowledge required to recognize the corrupt ideas in these movies, so some viewers may develop doubts that damage their eemaan and shake their belief; they may start to believe some of the false ideas and their hearts may be filled with evil poisons as a result of watching these movies. This is in addition to the haraam content in many of these movies, such as pictures of women, music and so on. We may also note the recent appearance of movies based on distorted Biblical beliefs or the false prophecies of liars and charlatans. These movies have become very popular in the West because of the spiritual vacuum resulting from the lack of true religion. Due to the environment surrounding the Muslims in western countries, some of them have started to follow these movies. Muslims should fear their Lord and avoid watching these films of kufr. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): Verily! The hearing, and the sight, of each of those you will be questioned by Allah. [Al-Isra 17:36]

1108,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1108,The Unlettered Prophet,Is there any evidence that the Prophet Muhammad was unable to read or write?,,,"Praise be to Allah.

Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
""Those who follow the Messenger, the Prophet who can neither read not write whom they find written with them in the Tawraat and the Injeel, - he commands them for al-Ma’roof (i.e., Islamic monotheism and all that Islaam has ordained); and forbids them from al-Munkar (i.e., disbelief, polytheism of all kinds, and all that Islaam has forbidden); he allows them as lawful al-Tayyibaat (i.e., all good and lawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons, foods, etc.), and prohibits them as unlawful al-khabaa’ith (i.e., all evil and unlawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons, foods, etc.), he releases them from their heavy burdens (of Allaah’s Covenant) and from the fetters (bindings) that were upon them. So those who believe in him (Muhammad), honor him, help him and follow the light (the Qur’aan) which has been sent down with him, it is they who will be successful.""
[al-A’raaf 7:157]

Al-Qurtubi, may Allaah have mercy on him, said in his tafseer of this aayah: ""Allaah says ‘al-ummi.’ Ibn ‘Abbaas, may Allaah be pleased with him, said: ‘Your Prophet was unlettered, unable to read or write or calculate.’ Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘Neither did you (O Muhammad) read any book before it (this Qur’an), nor did you write any book (whatsoever) with your right hand . . .’
[al-‘Ankaboot 29:48].""

Ibn Katheer, may Allaah have mercy on him, said in his tafseer of the second aayah quoted [al-‘Ankaboot 29:48]:
""Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘Neither did you (O Muhammad) read any book before it (this Qur’aan), nor did you write any book (whatsoever) with your right hand . . .’ i.e., ‘you (O Muhammad) lived among your people for a while before you brought this Qur’aan to them, and you never read any book or were able to write anything. Everyone among your people and others knows that you are an unlettered man, who does not read or write.’ This is how he was described in the previous Books as Allaah said (interpretation of the meaning): ‘Those who follow the Messenger, the Prophet who can neither read not write whom they find written with them in the Tawraat and the Injeel, - he commands them for al-Ma’roof (i.e., Islamic monotheism and all that Islaam has ordained); and forbids them from al-Munkar (i.e., disbelief, polytheism of all kinds, and all that Islaam has forbidden) . . .’ [al-A’raaf 7:157].

Hence the Prophet will remain unable to write even one line or one letter, until the Day of Resurrection. He had scribes who would write down in front of him the Revelation and letters to different regions. . . . Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘. . . In that case, indeed, the followers of falsehood might have doubted.’ [al-‘Ankaboot 29:48], i.e., if you had been good at it (reading and writing), some of the ignorant people would have doubted you and said that you had learnt this from the previous Books left by the Prophets. Indeed, they say this despite the fact that they know he was unlettered and unable to write, as it says in the Qur’aan (interpretation of the meaning): ‘And they say: ""Tales of the ancients, which he has written down, and they are dictated to him morning and afternoon.""’ [al-Furqaan 25:5]""

Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):

""He it is Who sent among the unlettered ones a Messenger from among themselves, reciting to them His Verses, purifying them (from the filth of disbelief and polytheism), and teaching them the Book and al-Hikmah (al-Sunnah). And verily, they had been before in manifest error.""
[al-Jumu’ah 62:2]

Al-Qurtubi, may Allaah have mercy on him, said in his tafseer of this aayah:
""It was said: ‘the unlettered ones’ means those who do not write. Such were the Quraysh. Mansoor reported from Ibraaheem, who said: ‘Al-ummi (the unlettered one) is the one who neither reads nor writes. ""A Messenger from among themselves"" means Muhammad , who was unlettered and never read a book nor learned how.’ Al-Mawardi said: ‘What is good about the fact that Allaah sent an unlettered Prophet? There are three things:
(i) his message fulfilled the foretelling of the previous Prophets;
(ii) this made him similar to and closer to other Prophets (illiterates);
(iii) this would eliminate all suspicion that he had learned the message he preached from books and writings that he had read.""

I say: all of this is evidence of the miraculous nature and truth of his Prophethood.

The ruling of having girlfriends and boyfriends in Islam","Praise be to Allah.The Quran prohibits having girlfriends or boyfriends
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“… Wed them with the permission of their own folk and give them their mahr (dowry) according to what is reasonable; they should be chaste, not adulterous, nor taking boyfriends…” [al-Nisa 4:25]
In his commentary on this ayah, Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
“Muhsanat [translated as “chaste”] means that they should be pure, not indulging in zina (unlawful sexual conduct), hence they are described as not being musafihat , which means promiscuous women who do not refuse anyone who wants to commit immoral acts with them. 
Regarding the phrase wa la muttakhidhati akhdan (‘nor taking boyfriends’), Ibn 'Abbas said: ‘al-musafihat means those who are known to commit zina, meaning those who will not refuse anyone who wants to commit immoral acts with them.’ Ibn 'Abbas also said: ‘muttakhidhati akhdan means lovers.’ A similar interpretation was narrated from Abu Hurayrah, Mujahid, al-Sha’bi, al-Dahhak, ‘Ata al-Khurasani, Yahya ibn Abi Kathir, Muqatil ibn Hayyan and al-Saddi. They said: (it means) lovers. Al-Hasan al-Basri said: ‘It means a (male) friend.’ Al-Dahhak also said: ‘wa la muttakhidhati akhdan also means a woman who has just one boyfriend or lover with whom she is happy. Allah has also forbidden this, meaning marrying her so long as she is in that situation…’”
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Made lawful to you this day are al-tayyibat [all kinds of halal (lawful) foods…]. The food of the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) is lawful to you and yours is lawful to them. (Lawful to you in marriage) are chaste women from the believers and chaste women from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before your time, when you have given their due mahr (bridal money given by the husband to the wife at the time of marriage), desiring chastity (i.e., taking them in legal wedlock), not committing illegal sexual intercourse, nor taking them as girlfriends. And whosoever disbelieves in the Oneness of Allah and in all the other articles of Faith, then fruitless is his work, and in the Hereafter he will be among the losers.” [al-Maidah 5:5]
Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
“Muhsineen ghayr musafiheen wa la muttakhidhi akhdan (‘desiring chastity (i.e., taking them in legal wedlock), not committing illegal sexual intercourse, nor taking them as girlfriends’ ). Just as Allah imposed the condition of chastity on women, meaning that they refrain from zina, so it is also imposed on men. The man must also be pure and chaste. So they should be ghayr musafiheen, meaning they should not be adulterers who do not refrain from sin and do not refuse any who come to them (for immoral purposes). Nor should they be muttakhidhi akhdan, meaning those who have girlfriends or female lovers with whom they have an exclusive relationship, as quoted above from Surat al-Nisa. (The one with many lovers or the one with just one lover) are both the same. For this reason Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal (may Allah have mercy on him) said that it is not right to marry a promiscuous woman unless she has repented, or to arrange a marriage of such a woman to a chaste man, so long as she is still conducting herself in this manner. Similarly, he (Ahmad) says that it is not right for a promiscuous man to marry a chaste woman unless he repents and gives up his immoral conduct, because of this ayah… We will discuss this matter in further detail after quoting the ayah (interpretation of the meaning):
“Let no man guilty of fornication or adultery marry any but a woman similarly guilty, or an unbeliever: nor let any but such a man or an unbeliever marry such a woman: to the believers such a thing is forbidden.” [al-Nur 24:3]
The Sunnah prohibits having girlfriends or boyfriends
Among the stories that show that it is forbidden to have girlfriends or to marry them is the story of Marthad ibn Abi Marthad, who used to smuggle Muslim prisoners-of-war from Makkah to Madinah. There was a prostitute in Makkah, called ‘Anaq, who had been a friend of Marthad’s. Marthad had promised to take one of the prisoners from Makkah to Madinah. He said: “I came to the shade of one of the gardens of Makkah on a moonlit night, then ‘Anaq came and saw my shadow by the garden. When she reached me, she recognized me and said: ‘Marthad?’ I said, ‘Marthad.’ She said: ‘Welcome! Stay with us tonight.’ I said, ‘O ‘Anaq, Allah has forbidden zina (unlawful sexual relations)’ … I came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and asked him, ‘O Messenger of Allah, should I marry ‘Anaq?’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) remained silent and did not answer me at all, until the ayah ‘Let no man guilty of adultery or fornication marry any but a woman similarly guilty, or an unbeliever; nor let any but such a man or an unbeliever marry such a woman; to the believers such a thing is forbidden’ [al-Nur 24:3 – Yusuf ‘Ali’s translation] was revealed. Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘O Marthad, Let no man guilty of adultery or fornication marry any but a woman similarly guilty, or an unbeliever; nor let any but such a man or an unbeliever marry such a woman, so do not marry her.’” (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 3101; he said: it is a hasan gharib hadith).
‘Abd-Allah ibn Mughaffal reported that there was a woman who had been a prostitute during the days of ignorance (before Islam). A man passed by her, or she passed by him, and he touched her. She said: “Stop it! (Mah! A word connoting a rebuke or denunciation). Allah has done away with shirk and had brought Islam.” So he left her alone and went away, still looking at her, until he walked into a wall, hitting his face. He came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and told him what had happened. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “You are a man for whom Allah wishes good. When Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, wishes good for His slave, He hastens the punishment for his sin, so that it is dealt with before the Day of Resurrection.” (Reported by al-Hakim, 1/349, who said this hadith is sahih according to the conditions of Muslim, and al-Dhahabi agreed with him. See Sahih al-Jami’, 308).

These ayat and ahadith clearly indicate that it is haram (forbidden) for men to have any kind of friendship or relationship with non-mahram women (women to whom they are not closely-related and to whom they could get married).

Is there any evidence from the Quran and Sunnah that I can present to them to show that these are indeed very sinful practices?",It is not permissible to join in the non-Muslim festivals because this entails imitating or resembling them and taking part in their festivals is a kind of befriending them and showing love for them.,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to join in the non-Muslim festivals for the following reasons: 

Firstly: because this entails imitating or resembling them , and “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud). This is a serious warning. `Abdullah ibn Al-`Aas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Whoever lives in the land of the disbelievers and celebrates their Nowruz (New Year) and their Mahrajan (festivals), and imitates them until he dies, he will be a loser on the Day of Resurrection. 
Secondly: taking part in their festivals is a kind of befriending them and showing love for them. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):

“O you who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians as Awliya’ (friends, protectors, helpers), they are but Awliya’ of each other. And if any amongst you takes them (as Awliya’), then surely, he is one of them…”  [Al-Ma’idah 5:51]
“O you who believe! Take not My enemies and your enemies (i.e. disbelievers and polytheists) as friends, showing affection towards them.” [Al-Mumtahanah 60:1] 

Thirdly: festivals are matters that are related to religion and beliefs and not to worldly customs, as is indicated by the Hadith: “Every nation has its Eid, and this is our `Eid.” Their `Eid or festival reflects their corrupt disbelief and polytheism. 
Fourthly: “And those who do not witness falsehood, and if they pass by some evil play or evil talk, they pass it by with dignity.” [Al-Furqan 25:72 – interpretation of the  meaning] The scholars interpreted this verse was referring to the festivals of the non-Muslims.

But Allah has been gracious to us, and has saved us from the torment of the Fire. Verily, we used to invoke Him (Alone) before. Verily, He is the Most Kind, the Most Merciful."" [al-Toor 52:25-28]
They will also remember the evil people who tried to make the people of faith have doubts and called them to kufr. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""Then they will turn to one another, mutually questioning. A speaker of them will say, ‘Verily, I had a companion (in the world), who used to say, ""Are you among those who believe (in resurrection after death), (that) when we die and become dust and bones, shall we indeed (be raised up) to receive reward or punishment (according to our deeds)?"" [al-Saffaat 37:50-53]
They will remember the trials and tribulations they went though in this world, with regard to themselves, their children, their families and their wealth, and they will say joyfully: ""… ‘All praise and thanks be to Allah, Who has removed from us (all) grief. Verily, our Lord is indeed Oft-Forgiving, Most Ready to appreciate (good deeds and to recompense).’"" [Faatir 35:34]
They will also be reminded of this life when they see the fruits which will resemble those which they used to eat in this world, but whose size and taste are different. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""… Every time they will be provided with a fruit therefrom, they will say: ‘This is what we were provided with before,’ and they will be given things in resemblance (i.e., in the same form but different in taste)…"" [al-Baqarah 2:25]
They will also recall their du’aa’s in times of hardship, when they raised their hands to heaven asking for their deeds to be accepted and for help to do righteous deeds and to be included among those who would inherit blessings. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""And some of them draw near to others, questioning, saying: ‘Aforetime, we were afraid with out families (of the punishment of Allah). But Allah has been gracious to us, and has saved us from the torment of the Fire. Verily, we used to invoke Him (Alone) before. Verily, He is the Most Kind, the Most Merciful."" [al-Toor 52:25-28]
As regards the matter of them desiring something like the blessings of this world, they will in fact desire something better than that, because even the person who is the lowest in status in Paradise will enjoy something like ten times the joys of this world. ‘Abdullaah ibn Mas’ood said: ""The Messenger of Allah (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) said: ‘I know who will be the last person to be brought out of Hell and the last person to enter Paradise. It will be a man who will come out of Hell crawling. Allah will say to him, ""Go and enter Paradise."" So he will go there and think that it is full, so he will come back and say, ""O Lord, I found it full."" Allah will say to him a second time, ""Go and enter Paradise."" So he will go there and think that it is full, so he will come back and say, ""O Lord, I found it full."" Allah will say to him, ""Go and enter Paradise, for there you will have something like the world and ten times more."" The man will say, ""Are You making fun of me (or are You laughing at me), and You are the King of all?""’ - and I saw the Messenger of Allah (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) smiling so broadly that his back teeth could be seen. He used to say, ‘That is the person who is lowest in status in Paradise.’"" [Agreed upon; this version is reported by Muslim, no. 272]
Everything that the people of Paradise desire will be theirs, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""… (there will be) therein all that one’s inner-self could desire, all that the eyes could delight in, and you will abide therein forever."" [al-Zukhruf 43:71]
A number of ahaadeeth state that the people of Paradise will have their desires for children or to grow things fulfilled, without having to wait for them.
Abu Hurayrah reported that the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) was speaking about the people of Paradise one day when a Bedouin was present. He described how a man of the people of Paradise will ask his Lord’s permission to grow some plants. (In Arabic, the past tense is used here to show that this will undoubtedly happen). Allah will ask him, ""Do you not already have all that you want?"" He will say, ""Yes, but I like to grow things."" So he will go and plant his seeds, and within the blinking of an eye they will grow, ripen, be harvested and piled up like mountains. Allah will say, ""Here you are, O son of Adam, nothing makes you satisfied!"" The Bedouin said, ""O Messenger of Allah, you will find that he is either from Quraysh or the Ansaar, for they are the ones who like to grow things; we don’t like to grow anything!"" The Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) smiled broadly. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 6965).
Ibn Hijr reported the following hadeeth in Fath al-Baari; from it we learn that whatever worldly desires one wishes for in Paradise can be fulfilled.
Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri reported that the Messenger of Allah (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) said: ""If the believer in Paradise wishes for a child, it will be conceived and delivered, and will grow to the desired age in an instant."" (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 2487. Abu ‘Eesaa said: This is a ghareeb hasan hadeeth; see also Saheeh al-Jaami’, 6649)
We ask Allah to make us among the people of Paradise by His Grace and Mercy.

    zakaah to a Raafidi","What is the ruling on giving the zakaah
      of the Sunnis to the Raafidi (Shi’ah) poor? If a Muslim who is obliged to pay zakaah
      gives it to a poor Raafidi, has he discharged his responsibility or not?",,,"Praise be to Allah.In the chapters of their books which discuss who is
    entitled to receive zakaah funds, the scholars have stated that these funds are not to be
    given to a kaafir or an innovator (follower of bid’ah). The Raafidis are undoubtedly
    kuffaar for four reasons:
They cast aspersions on the Qur’aan, claiming that two-thirds of it
        has been omitted, as is stated in their book by al-Noori which is called Fasl
        al-Khitaab fi Ithbaat Tahreef Kitaab Rabb al-Arbaab, and in Al-Kaafi, and other
        books. Whoever casts aspersions on the Qur’aan is a kaafir who disbelieves in the
        words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): “and surely, We will guard it
        (from corruption)” [al-Hijr 15:9]

They cast aspersions upon the Sunnah and the saheeh ahaadeeth. They do
        not follow them, because they were narrated from the Sahaabah who, according to them, are
        kuffaar. They believe that the Sahaabah became kaafirs after the Prophet 
 (peace and
        blessings of Allaah be upon him) died, apart from ‘Ali and his descendents, Salmaan,
        ‘Ammaar and a few others. But with regard to the first three khaleefahs and the
        majority of the Sahaabah who gave their bay’ah (oath of allegiance) to them,
        they think that they all apostatized and became kaafirs, so their ahaadeeth cannot be
        accepted. This is stated in al-Kaafi and other books of theirs.

They regard the Sunnis (Ahl al-Sunnah) as kaafirs, so they do not
        pray with you. Whoever prays behind a Sunni will repeat his prayer. Indeed, they think
        that we are naajis (impure), and when they shake hands with us they go and wash
        their hands. Whoever regards the Muslims as kaafirs is himself a kaafir, so we regard them
        as kaafirs just as they regard us as kaafirs, and more so.

They commit clear shirk in their exaggerations about ‘Ali
        and his descendents and in their calling upon them alongside Allaah. This is stated
        clearly in their books, where they exaggerate about them and describe them in terms that
        are befitting only for the Lord of the Worlds. We have heard this in their tapes. They do
        not participate in the charity work of the Ahl al-Sunnah, or give charity to the Sunni
        poor; if they do these things, it is with deeply rooted and hidden hatred, and they do
        that as a form of taqiyyah (dissimulation, calculated deception). On these grounds,
        anyone who has given zakaah to them must pay his zakaah again, because he has given it to
        someone who will be helped in his kufr and to wage war against the Sunnah thereby. Whoever
        is obliged to pay zakaah is forbidden to give it to a Raafidi; if he does this, he has not
        discharged his obligation and he has to pay it again because he did not give the money
        with which he had been entrusted to the people who were entitled to receive it. Whoever
        doubts this, let him read the books that have been written in refutation of them, such as
        the book by al-Qifaari which refutes their way, and al-Khutoot al-‘Areedah by
        al-Khateeb, and the books of Ehsan Ilahi Zaheer, and others. And Allaah is the Source of

As for your first question, if circumcision does not cause you harm, you can have it performed by a surgeon whos experience and skill you trust. If it would cause you harm, then you dont have to do it and that will not adversely affect your Islam, InShaa'a Allah (Allah Willing).
As for changing your name, note that the most beloved names to Allah are: Abdul-llah (The Slave/worshipper of Allah) and Abdul-Rahman (The Slave/worshipper of the Most Merciful one of the names of Allah). This came to us in the authentic Hadeeth (sayings) of the Prophet (Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon Him) which was narrated by Muslim (hadeeth number 3975).
If you want us to choose one of the names that you have listed, you can use Aasim which means: protector preserver defender guarder.

Does she still perform the salah if she is having contractions but no fluid has come from her body yet?,,,"Praise be to Allah.We put the following question to Shaykh
    Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, may Allaah preserve him:
If a woman whose pregnancy has reached full term passes blood
    and has pains, but she does not know whether these are the contractions that will lead to
    childbirth or contractions that will later ease off [“practice” contractions,
    also known as Braxton-Hicks contractions], should she pray or not?
He answered, may Allaah preserve him:
Of course, there are two things we may assume here: 
The first is that the pregnancy will continue without
    contractions.
The second is that the apparent case is that these are
    contractions, so she should stop praying.
If this is what usually happens to her, and she may carry on
    having contractions for four or five days without giving birth, then in this case she
    should still pray.
Question:
If she acts upon the second assumption, then the contractions
    ease off, should we tell her to make up the prayers she has missed?
Answer:
It is preferable to make them up, because she took her
    decision on the basis of an assumption.
In summary, then:
If this woman usually has contractions for a number of days
    – more than two or three – then this is not nifaas and she should pray. If that
    is not what usually happens, then we assume that it is nifaas in the sense that she should
    stop praying. If she stops praying, then it turns out that it was not nifaas, then in this
    case we say that if she makes up the prayers she has missed, this is good, and if she does
    not make them up, there is nothing wrong with that because she acted on an assumption.

(Some Muslim scholars that he should be physically reprimanded if he does not fast by the age of 10, which is the same rule that is applied to prayer; refer to Al Mughni 3/90). The boy will get a reward for fasting and his parents will get a reward for teaching him well and guiding him to that which is good. Al Rubayyi’ bint Mu’awwadh (may Allah be pleased with her) said about fasting ‘Aashouraa’ at the time when it was mandatory to fast it and not voluntary: we used to make our young boys fast, and we made them a toy made out of wool. If one of the boys cried [wanting] food, we would give him [the toy to distract him] until it was time to break the fast."" (Al Bukhari Fath # 1960). (Ashouraa is the tenth day of the month of Muharram. Although fasting this day is now voluntary the majority of Muslims usually fast.) Some people are quite lenient and lax when it comes to making their children fast. A situation may even arise where the young child feels enthusiastic and chooses to fast and is physically capable of doing so, then his father or mother order him to break his fast claiming that it is out of sympathy. Little do they know that real sympathy is in stressing the importance of fasting and teaching the child about it. Allah said in Surat ul-Tahreem (interpretation of the meaning): ""O you who believe! Ward yourselves and your families off from a fire (Hell) whose fuel is of men and stones, over which are appointed angels stern and severe, who do not disobey the commands they receive from Allah, and execute that which they are commanded."" We must pay extra attention to the young girl when she first starts fasting after she reaches puberty.

  our beards grow in order to be different from the mushrikeen, but nowadays they let their
  beards grow too. What is your opinion?",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is waajib (obligatory) to let the beard grow, and shaving it is
haraam (forbidden). Imaam Ahmad, al-Bukhaari, Muslim and others narrated from Ibn
‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him and his father) that the Prophet 
 (peace
and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Be different from the mushrikeen: let
your beards grow and trim your moutsaches.” Ahmad and Muslim reported from Abu
Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of
Allaah be upon him) said: “Cut your moustaches and let your beards grow: be different
from the Magians.” Persisting in shaving one’s beard is a major sin (kabeerah);
the one who does this should be advised against it, and his action should be denounced,
especially if he is in a position of religious leadership. 
The idea of being different from the Magians and other mushrikeen does
not mean being different from them in every single thing, particularly if they happen to
be doing something righteous or good in accordance with the fitrah (natural inclinations
of man). What is meant is that we should be different from them in matters where they have
gone astray and deviated from the truth and the dictates of the fitrah, and gone against
the way of the Prophets and Messengers by shaving their beards. We should differ from them
in this case by letting our beards grow and cutting our moustaches, following the guidance
of the Prophets and Messengers, and in accordance with the fitrah. It is proven that the
Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Ten
things are part of the fitrah: cutting the moustache, letting the beard grow, cleaning the
teeth with a siwaak, rinsing the nose with water, cutting one’s nails, washing
between the finger-joints, plucking the armpit hairs, shaving the pubic hair and cleaning
one’s private parts with water.” (Reported by Ahmad, Muslim and the four
authors of Sunan, from the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah, may Allaah be pleased
with her). Even if the kaafiroon start letting their beards grow, this does
not mean that the Muslims are allowed to shave theirs, because as we have stated above,
the idea is not to be different from them in everything, only in the things in which they
have deviated from the truth and from the fitrah.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

This raises a number of questions, such as whether the person who has AIDS should be forcibly isolated from people who do not have the disease. What is the ruling on a person who deliberately transmits the disease to others? Is the person who has this disease considered to be suffering a terminal illness, because this is a factor in matters of divorce and financial transactions?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: isolation of the sick.
The medical information that is currently available states that the AIDS virus is not transmitted through living with a person or touching him; it is not airborne; it is not transmitted through insects or through sharing food, drink, swimming pools, seats, eating utensils, and whatever else has to do with the ordinary details of living together day by day. The disease is primarily transferred in one of the following ways:

Sexual contact, of whatever kind.
Transfusion of infected blood or blood products.
Using infected needles, especially among those who use drugs; using infected razors.
AIDS may be passed from an infected mother to her child during pregnancy or childbirth. 

On the basis of the above, it is not necessary to isolate infected people from their healthy colleagues if there is no fear of them passing on the disease. The patient may be dealt with according to regular medical procedures. 
Secondly: deliberately transmitting the disease.
Deliberately passing on AIDS to a healthy person is the deliberate commission of a haraam (forbidden) deed, and is counted as a serious major sin. It requires a punishment in this world, to be determined in accordance with the level of the crime and its impact on individuals and society as a whole.
If the intention was to spread this terrible disease in society, this is counted as a kind of aggression and spreading mischief on earth, which should be met with one of the punishments referred to in the aayah:
“The recompense of those who wage war against Allaah and His Messenger and do mischief in the land is only that they shall be killed or crucified or their hands and their feet be cut off on the opposite sides, or be exiled from the land. That is their disgrace in this world, and a great torment is theirs in the Hereafter.” [al-Maa’idah 5:33]
If his aim is to deliberately infect a specific person, and this is what happens, but the person who has been infected has not yet died, the person who did this should be punished with ta’zeer (a punishment to be determined by the qaadi or judge). If the infected person dies, then the matter of execution should be looked into.
If his aim is to deliberately infect a specific person, but this does not happen, then he should be punished with ta’zeer.
Thirdly: considering AIDS to be a terminal illness:
In sharee’ah, AIDS is counted as a terminal illness once it is full-blown and the patient is no longer living a normal life and death is approaching.","Majma’ al-Fiqh al-Islaami, pp. 204-206."

    to Allaah and in order to earn His pleasure, even if His creatures are angry. You must
    also avoid the sources of trouble, and put your trust in Allaah, hoping that He will
    provide a way out for you. Allaah says (interpretation of the meanings): “…
    And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get
    out (from every difficulty). And He will provide him from (sources) he never could
    imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allaah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allaah
    will accomplish His purpose. Indeed, Allaah has set a measure for all things”

    to Him, He will make his matter easy for him. That is the Command of Allaah, which He has
    sent down to you, and whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He will remit his
    sins from him and will enlarge his reward.” [al-Talaaq 65:5].

Ibn ‘Umar narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Be different from the polytheists; let your beards grow and trim your moustaches.” According to another report: “Trim your moustaches and let your beards grow .” 
There are other hadith which convey the same meaning, which is to leave the beard as it is and let it grow long, without shaving, plucking or cutting any part of it. 
Ibn Hazm reported that there was scholarly consensus that it is an obligation to trim the moustache and let the beard grow . He quoted a number of ahadith as evidence, including the hadith of Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) quoted above, and the hadith of Zayd ibn Arqam in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does not remove any of his moustache is not one of us.” (Classed as sahih by al-Tirmidhi). 
Ibn Hazm said in al-Furu’: “This formula according to our colleagues [i.e., the Hanbalis] means that it is haram to shave the beard .” 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“The Quran, Sunnah and ijma’ (scholarly consensus) all indicate that we must differ from the unbelievers in all aspects and not imitate them, because imitating them on the outside will make us imitate them in their bad deeds and habits, and even in beliefs, which will result in befriending them in our hearts, just as loving them in our hearts will lead to imitating them on the outside. Al-Tirmidhi reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “He is not one of us who imitates people other than us. Do not imitate the Jews and Christians.” According to another version: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them. ” (Reported by al-Imam Ahmad)
‘Umar ibn al-Khattab rejected the testimony of the person who plucked his beard. Al-Imam Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said in al-Tamhid: “It is forbidden to shave the beard, and no one does this except men who are effeminate” i.e., those who imitate women. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had a thick beard (reported by Muslim from Jabir). It is not permitted to remove any part of the beard because of the general meaning of the texts which forbid doing so.”

1195,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1195,Is It Haram to Have Long Nails?,"What is the ruling on men or women letting their nails grow long? If it is forbidden, what is the wisdom behind this prohibition?",Having long nails is against the fitrah. The reason behind cutting the nails is cleanliness and hygiene because dirt can gather under the nails.,,"Praise be to Allah.Cutting the nails is part of the fitrah . Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The fitrah is five things: circumcision , removing the pubic hair, trimming the moustache, cutting the nails, and plucking the armpit hairs .” (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim).
According to another hadith, ten things are part of the fitrah, including cutting the nails. Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) set a time limit for us to cut our moustaches, cut our nails, pluck our armpit hairs and shave our pubic hairs: we were not to leave it any longer than forty days.” (Reported by Ahmad, Muslim and al-Nasai; this version narrated by Ahmad).
Whoever does not cut his nails is going against the fitrah. The reason behind this is cleanliness and hygiene, because dirt can gather under the nails. It also serves the purpose of making us different from those among the non-Muslims who allow their nails to grow long, and from animals that have claws and talons. (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 5/173)
Another bad habit that many people have is to leave one nail long. All of this is clearly contrary to the ways of the fitrah.

1196,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1196,Is Muhammad peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) created from light? What is wrong with celebrating his birthday?,"In our locality there are people who hold
      celebrations of the birthday of the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
      him) every year. They think that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
      him) is not like the rest of mankind, but that he is light from the Light of Allaah
      Himself, that he is present and watching in every place, and that he himself attends every
      gathering held to celebrate his birthday, he hears what the people say about him, and he
      is there with them. For that reason they stand up and say in unison: “Yaa
      Nabi-Allaah, yaa Rasool-Allaah, yaa Habeeb-Allaah, salaam ‘alayka (O Prophet of
      Allaah, O Messenger of Allaah, O Beloved of Allaah, peace be upon you).” They call
      out to him as if he were present and ask for his help and support. What is the Islamic
      ruling on this? Is it correct or not? Is it sunnah, bid’ah, or what?",,,"Praise be to Allah.alone, and peace and blessings be upon 
  His Messenger and his family and companions.

Celebrating the birthday of the Prophet  
      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is an innovation (bid’ah) 
      which goes against the guidance of the Prophet  
      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and of the Rightly Guided Khaleefahs 
      (al-khulafaa’ al-raashidoon) and the Sahaabah, may Allaah be 
      pleased with them. It is proven that the Prophet  
      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever does anything 
      that is not part of this matter of ours (i.e., Islam), will have it rejected.” 
      (For more details, please see Question # 249).


Believing that the Prophet  (peace 
      and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is not like the rest of humanity, and 
      that he is light from the Light of Allaah Himself is not a correct belief, 
      because it contradicts the Qur’aan. Allaah has stated that the Prophet 
       (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
      is human, and has explained what makes the Prophet  
      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) different from the rest of mankind. 
      He said (interpretation of the meaning):

“Say (O Muhammad): ‘I am only a man like you. It 
    has been inspired to me that your God is One God (Allaah). So whoever hopes 
    for the Meeting with his Lord, let him work righteousness and associate none 
    as a partner in the worship of his Lord.” [al-Kahf 18:110]
Mankind, human beings, are created, as Allaah says (interpretation 
    of the meaning):
“O mankind! Be dutiful to your Lord, Who created you from 
    a single person (Adam), and from him He created his wife (Hawwa/Eve), and 
    from them both He created many men and women…” [al-Nisaa’ 4:1]
“O mankind, if you are in doubt about the Resurrection, 
    then verily! We have created you from dust, then from a nutfah (mixed drops 
    of male and female sexual discharge)…” [al-Hajj 22:5]
“O Prophet! Verily, We have sent you as witness, and a 
    bearer of glad tidings, and a warner, - and as one who invites to Allaah by 
    His leave, and as a lamp spreading light.” [al-Ahzaab 33:45-46]
In contrast, Allaah is the First, and He has no beginning, as 
    He says (interpretation of the meaning):
“He is the First (nothing is before Him) and the Last (nothing 
    is after Him), the Most High (nothing is above Him), and the Most Near (nothing 
    is nearer than Him). And He is the All-Knower of every thing.” [al-Hadeed 
    57:3]
Allaah called His Prophet “light” and a “lamp 
    spreading light” because of the guidance and light with which Allaah 
    sent him, with which Allaah guides all those who answer his call  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), as He says (interpretation of 
    the meaning):
“… Indeed, there has come to you a light (Prophet 
    Muhammad  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him)) and a plain Book (this Qur’aan).” [al-Maa’idah 5:15]
Saying that he is present and watching in every place, that 
      he is himself present at every gathering to celebrate his birthday, and 
      that he hears what the people present are saying, is all false. There is 
      no basis for this in either the Qur’aan or the Sunnah.
Calling on him and seeking his help and support is a form 
      of major shirk which is not permitted, whether one is calling on the Prophet 
       (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
      or on any other created being, because Allaah says (interpretation of the 
      meaning):
“… so invoke not anyone along with Allaah.” 
      [al-Junn 72:18]
“And whoever invokes (or worships) besides Allaah, any 
      other god of whom he has no proof, then his reckoning is only with his Lord. 
      Surely! Al-kaafiroon (the disbelievers) will not be successful.” [al-Mu’minoon 
      23:117]
(Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 3/4)
The Muslim should follow, not innovate. He should believe in 
  Allaah alone, call on Him alone and seek His help alone. He should not call 
  on or seek the help of anyone else. The consequences of shirk are devastating, 
  as it will wipe out all a person’s good deeds and lead to his doom in Hell. 
  Bid’ah is a serious matter, which will cause a person’s deeds to be 
  thrown back at him, not accepted. The Muslim should love, respect, honour and 
  obey the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
  be upon him), and give his words precedence over the words of any other human 
  being, but it is not permitted to exaggerate about him, or to raise his status 
  above that which has been bestowed upon him by Allaah, or to call on him instead 
  of Allaah, because this is a violation of the rights of Allaah, and involves 
  directing acts of worship to someone other than Allaah, when they should only 
  be directed towards Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted. We ask Allaah to 
  help us to do that which will please Him and to avoid that which will earn His 
  wrath, and to help us to love Him and His Prophet  
  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.
