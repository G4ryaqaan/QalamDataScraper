23301,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/23301,Funeral prayer for a child,Should a child be washed and the janaazah (funeral) prayer be offered for him? Please note that the child is 8 years old.,,,"Praise be to Allah.A child should be washed and the funeral prayer offered for him according to all the scholars. Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said that there was no dispute concerning this matter. Ibn al-Mundhir narrated that there was consensus among the scholars that a child should be prayed for. See al-Mughni, 3/458. 
When the prayer is offered for a child, there should be no prayer for forgiveness, and it should not be said in the prayer “Allahumma aghfir lahu (O Allah forgive him),” because no sins were recorded for him. Rather prayers should be said for forgiveness and mercy for his parents. That is because of the report narrated by Abu Dawood (3180) and al-Tirmidhi (1031) from al-Mugheerah ibn Shu’bah, that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The funeral prayer should be offered for him and prayers should be said for forgiveness and mercy for his parents.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Ahkam al-Jana’iz, p. 73.

23302,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/23302,Sitting with non-mahrams in complete hijab,Must a woman wear jilbab in the house in front of non-mahrams such as brother in laws or can she wear loose fitting clothes and head scarf?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.What Allaah has enjoined on women is to 
    conceal their whole bodies from non-mahrams, including the face and hands. The clothing should be loose and not show the shape of any part of the 
    body, and it should not provoke desire. 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah 
    have mercy on him) said: 
It is permissible for a woman to sit with her 
    husband’s brother or cousins etc., so long as she is wearing proper Islamic hijab, covering her face, hair and all of her body, because she is 
    ‘awrah and a source of temptation, and so long as there is nothing suspect about this sitting with them, and she is not sitting alone with any one 
    of them. 
With regard to sitting alone with one of 
    them, or in a suspicious manner, that is not permissible. 
It is more important that a woman should 
    observe hijab in front of her husband’s relatives such as his brothers, because the husband’s relatives can enter upon her and sit with her 
    without anyone denouncing that, then that may lead to regrettable consequences. See question no.

23308,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/23308,Can You Say Bismillah in the Bathroom before Wudu?,Is it ok to say Bismillah in the heart because my wudhu area is attached to the toilet and I do not want to mention the name of Allah aloud there?,"If the place where you do wudu is inside the bathroom, then it is makruh to utter the name of Allah in this place, even though it is prescribed to say Bismillah when doing wudu. Some scholars say you can say Bismillah in your heart without uttering it.",,"Praise be to Allah.It is makruh to mention the name of Allah in the place where one relieves oneself , out of respect for the name of Allah so that His name will not be mentioned in a place of impurity which is the abode of the devils. 
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Adhkar (p. 21-22): 
“It is makruh to recite dhikr and to speak when relieving oneself, whether that is in the desert or inside a building. All kinds of dhikr and speech are the same in this regard, except in cases of necessity. Some of our companions even say that if a person sneezes (in the bathroom), he should not say “al-hamdu Lillah”, and one should not say “yarhamuk-Allah” to a person who sneezes, or return the greeting of salam, or respond to the muadhdhin in the bathroom. All of that is makruh but is not haram. If a person sneezes and praises Allah in his heart without moving his tongue, there is nothing wrong with that. The same applies when having intercourse  
And we narrated that Ibn ‘Umar said: A man passed by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) whilst he was urinating and greeted him with salam, but he did not return the greeting. (Narrated by Muslim in his Sahih, 370). And it was narrated that al-Muhajir ibn Qunfudh (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) whilst he was urinating and greeted him with salam, but he did not return the greeting until he had done wudu, then he apologized to me and said: I do not like to mention the name of Allah unless I am in a state of purity.” (A sahih hadith narrated by Abu Dawud, al-Nasai and Ibn Majah with a sahih isnad).”
Based on this, if the place where you do wudu is inside the bathroom – which is the place for relieving oneself and is not used for washing only – then it is makruh to utter the name of Allah in this place, even though it is prescribed to say Bismillah (when doing wudu) . Some of the scholars say that a person should say Bismillah in his heart without uttering it on his tongue. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’ (1/130): 
“If a person is in the bathroom, then Imam Ahmad said: If a man sneezes he should praise Allah in his heart. It may be deduced from this report that he should also say Bismillah in his heart. 
Others suggested that it is most likely that it is still prescribed to say Bismillah. They said: He should say it out loud and it is not makruh in this place.” 
Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“There is nothing wrong with doing wudu inside the bathroom if necessary, and saying Bismillah at the beginning , because saying Bismillah is obligatory according to some scholars, and is strongly encouraged according to the majority. So he should do that, and the ruling on it being makruh is waived, because such rulings are waived when it is necessary to say Bismillah. A person is commanded to say Bismillah when starting to do wudu, so he should say it and complete his wudu.” (Majmu’ Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 10/28)
It says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 5/94:
“It is makruh to utter the name of Allah in the bathroom where a person relieves himself, out of respect for His name, but it is prescribed to say Bismillah when starting to do wudu, because it is obligatory according to a group of scholars.
If the place where one does wudu is outside the bathroom, even if it is attached to it, then it is prescribed for the person who is doing wudu to utter Bismillah and it is not makruh in this case because he is not inside the bathroom.”

23317,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/23317,Problem of forgetting appointments,"I am a young mother of two young children.  

I have found that since i have had my children my memory has gotten very bad. Subhanallah I forget so much.  

So many people ask things of me and i say yes to them and have full intention of doing it for them however i simply forget. I know that this is a problem also for most of the sisters these days also. 

I was told by my maternal nurse that it is normal when women start having children. can it also be because of sins? Will i be in sin for not keeping my word?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Perhaps your forgetfulness – or your weak memory – is a 
    result of giving birth, as your doctor said. This is not something to worry 
    about. Or this forgetfulness may be caused by sin, because sins result in 
    punishments that affect the heart and the body. Imaam Ibn al-Qayyim (may 
    Allaah have mercy on him) mentioned more than sixty punishments for sin in 
    his book al-Daa’ wa’l-Dawa’. 
So if a person feels that 
    he is losing some blessing, he should hasten to repent to Allaah. Allaah 
    says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “That is so because Allaah will never change a grace which 
    He has bestowed on a people until they change what is in their ownselves”

    [al-Anfaal 8:53]

    If a person makes a promise then forgets it unintentionally, 
    there is no sin on him, because Allaah has forgiven this ummah for what they 
    forget, as is indicated by the texts. For example, the last two verses of 
    Soorat al-Baqarah (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error”

    [al-Baqarah 2:286]

    And Allaah has said: “I have done that.” (Narrated by 
    Muslim) 

    There are also means that will help you to remember 
    appointments, such as using a diary (in book or electronic form) to record 
    appointments by day and date. This is a means which is proven to work. How 
    many people forget their appointments, but they organize them by using these 
    reminders. 

    Another means is using an electronic alarm clock or a mobile 
    phone to remind you of the time of an appointment… and other modern means 
    that are available. 

    There are also audio reminders on which you can record 
    appointments and it will speak to remind you of the appointment. 

    Each person must pay as much attention as possible to this 
    matter, because breaking promises is one of the signs of the hypocrites, as 
    it says in the hadeeth: “There are four characteristics, whoever has them is 
    a pure hypocrite, and whoever has one of them has one of the attributes of 
    hypocrisy until he gives it up: when he speaks, he lies; when he makes a 
    pledge he betrays it; when he makes a promise he breaks it; and when he 
    disputes he resorts to obscene speech.”

     (Narrated by Muslim, 53)

     Keeping appointments is one of the signs of the people of 
    faith.

     Similarly those who miss appointments for a reason such as that mentioned in the question should explain their reasons to the other party involved, so that he will not be offended.

23320,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/23320,To whom should ba’yah (allegiance) be given?,Can you please clarify whether it is compulsory for every Muslim to take BAIT on some one's Hand as people did with The Prophet PBU and Khula Rashedeen.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Bay’ah can only be given to the leader of the Muslims, and bay’ah 
    is given by the decision makers – i.e., the scholars and people of virtue and status. Once they give their allegiance to him, his position of 
    leadership is confirmed, and the common folk do not have to give allegiance to him themselves, rather they have to obey him so long as that does 
    not entail disobedience towards Allaah.  
Al-Maaziri said: With regard to bay’ah being given to the leader 
    of the Muslims, it is sufficient for the decision makers to give him their bay’ah. It is not essential for each individual Muslim to come to him 
    and put his hand in his, rather it is sufficient to commit oneself to obeying him and submitting to him by not going against him or rebel against 
    him.  
Quoted from Fath al-Baari. 
Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said 
    in Sharh Saheeh Muslim: 
With regard to bay’ah (oath of allegiance): 
    the scholars are agreed that in order for it to be valid it is not essential for all the people or all the decision makers to give their bay’ah. 
    Rather, if bay’ah is given by those scholars and people of virtue and status who are present, that is sufficient. It is not obligatory for each 
    person to come to the leader and put his hand in his and give his oath of allegiance to him. Rather what is required of each individual is to 
    submit to him and not go against him or rebel against him. 
What is narrated in the ahaadeeth narrated in 
    the books of Sunnah about bay’ah refers to giving allegiance to the Muslim leader, such as when the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “Whoever dies and did not make an oath of allegiance (to the Muslim leader) has died a death of jaahiliyyah.” (Narrated by Muslim, 
    1851). 
And he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “Whoever gives his oath of allegiance to a leader and gives him his hand and his heart, let him obey him as much as he can. If 
    another one comes and disputes with him (for leadership), kill the second one.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1844) 
And he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “If allegiance is given to two khaleefahs, then kill the second of them.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1853). 
All of that undoubtedly has to do with giving 
    allegiance to the Muslim leader. 
Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan (may Allaah preserve 
    him) said, answering a question about giving allegiance to the various groups: Bay’ah only has to do with the leader of the Muslims; these various 
    bay’ahs are innovated and they are among the causes of division. The Muslims who are living in one country or one kingdom should have one 
    allegiance to one leader; it is not permissible to have several kinds of bay’ah. al-Muntaqa min Fataawa al-Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan, 1/367 
With regard to how the allegiance should be given to the leader, 
    in the case of men it is done in word and in deed, namely with a handshake. In the case of women, it is done by word only. This is proven in the 
    ahaadeeth which speak of how allegiance was given to the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
For example, ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased 
    with her) said: “No, by Allaah, the hand of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) never touched the hand of any 
    (non-mahram) woman. Rather he would accept their allegiance (bay’ah) in words only.”
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5288; Muslim, 
    1866) 
Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said 
    in his Sharh (commentary): “This indicates that for women, allegiance is given in words only, without taking the hand of the leader, and 
    for men it is done in words and by taking his hand.

23325,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/23325,Making friends with a kaafir woman,"Is it allowed for a muslim woman to be friends with a non-muslim woman who is very decent, without neglecting her one religion and is there a severe punishment if she does?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Undoubtedly making friends with a kaafir woman will adversely 
    affect her religious commitment, because a kaafir woman does not behave in 
    the same manner or have the same attitude as a Muslim woman, and she does 
    not worship Allaah according to the religion of Islam. Therefore she will 
    not avoid doing things that may adversely affect this Muslim woman who may 
    be deceived by the modest dress or good manners of this kaafir woman, 
    especially in matters that will adversely affect her religious commitment. 

    Similarly, making friends with her may lead to some kind of 
    approval in one's heart for the rituals that she does as part of her own 
    religion, and this will weaken the sense of friendship and enmity for the 
    sake of Allaah (al-wala’ wa’l-bara’). 

    Indeed, it may lead some ignorant people to disapprove of the 
    ruling of Allaah that the kaafirs are disbelievers who will abide in Hell 
    forever – we seek refuge with Allaah. Hence the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Do not keep company with anyone but 
    a believer and do not let anyone eat your food but one who is pious.” 
    (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2395; Abu Dawood, 4832; classed as saheeh by Ibn 
    Hibbaan, 2/314; classed as hasan by Shaykh al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 
    7341). 
We do not mean, however, 
    that this Muslim woman should cut herself off completely from the kaafir 
    woman; she may visit with her, visit her when she is sick and give her 
    gifts, but without forming an emotional attachment or joining in their 
    festivals and celebrations. And the Muslim woman should aim, in those visits 
    and gift-giving, to call this kaafir woman to Islam. This is what our 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did, as is 
    mentioned in two hadeeths: 

    1 – It was narrated from Sa’eed ibn al-Musayyib that his 
    father said: “When Abu Taalib was on his deathbed, the Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) entered upon him, and Abu Jahl and 
    ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Abi Umayyah were present. The Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, ‘O uncle, say Laa ilaaha 
    ill-Allaah, and I will plead for you before Allaah.’ Abu Jahl and 
    ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Abi Umayyah said: ‘O Abu Taalib, will you turn away from the 
    religion of ‘Abd al-Muttalib?’ The Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: ‘I will keep on praying for forgiveness for you 
    until I am forbidden (by Allaah) to do so.” Then the following aayah was 
    revealed: 
“It is not (proper) for 
    the Prophet and those who believe to ask Allaah’s forgiveness for the 
    Mushrikoon, even though they be of kin, after it has become clear to them 
    that they are the dwellers of the Fire (because they died in a state of 
    disbelief)”

    [al-Tawbah 9:113]

    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4398; Muslim, 24 

    2 – It was narrated that Anas (may Allaah be pleased with 
    him) said: “There was a Jewish boy who used to serve the Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and he fell sick. The Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came to visit him; he sat by his 
    head and said, ‘Become Muslim.’ The boy looked at his father, who was 
    present, and he (the father) said: ‘Obey Abu’l-Qaasim  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him).’ So he became Muslim, and the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) left, saying, ‘Praise be to 
    Allaah Who has saved him from the Fire.’” 

    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1290. 

    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    gave permission to Asma’ bint Abi Bakr to receive her mushrik mother (when 
    she came to visit her), and ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) gave a 
    gift of a garment to his mushrik brother. 

    It was narrated that Asma’ bint Abi Bakr (may Allaah be 
    pleased with her) said: “My mother came to visit me at the time of the 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and 
    she was a mushrik. So I consulted the Messenger of Allaah,  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) and asked him, ‘My mother wants to visit me 
    and expects me to treat her kindly; should I uphold the ties of kinship with 
    my mother?’ He said, ‘Yes, uphold the ties of kinship with your mother.’” 

    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2477; Muslim, 1003 

    It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be 
    pleased with them both) said: “ ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab saw a silken garment 
    being sold at the door of the mosque. He said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, why 
    don’t you buy it and wear it on Fridays and when the delegations come to 
    you?’ He said, ‘This is worn by one who has no share in the Hereafter.’ 
    Later on some silken garments were brought and the Messenger of Allaah  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) gave one to ‘Umar. He said, ‘Are 
    you giving me this to wear when you said what you said about the garment of 
    ‘Utaarid?’ He said, ‘I did not give it to you to wear.’ So ‘Umar gave it to 
    a mushrik brother of his in Makkah to wear.” 

    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2470; Muslim 2068. 

    Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan said: There is nothing wrong with 
    visiting kaafirs in order to call them to Islam. The Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) visited his paternal uncle Abu Taalib when 
    he was dying and called him to Islam, and he visited the Jewish boy and 
    called him to Islam. 

    But visiting kaafirs in order to have a good time with them 
    is not permitted, because it is obligatory to hate them and shun them. It is 
    permissible to accept their gifts because the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) accepted gifts from some of the kaafirs, 
    such as the gift from al-Muqawqis the ruler of Egypt. But it is not 
    permissible to congratulate them on the occasion of their festivals because 
    this implies befriending them and approving of their falsehood.

Prohibition of backbiting, slander and gossip in Islam 


Expiation for backbiting, slander and gossip","Praise be to Allah.Importance of guarding the tongue in Islam
The Muslim has to guard his tongue and avoid things that have been forbidden. Among these forbidden things which people often take lightly are ghibah (backbiting), buhtan (slander ) and namimah (malicious gossip ). 
Ghibah or backbiting means speaking about a Muslim in his absence and saying things that he would not like to have spread around or mentioned. Buhtan or slander means saying things about a Muslim that are not true, or in other words telling lies about him. Namimah or malicious gossip means telling one person what another said in order to cause trouble between them. 
Prohibition of backbiting, slander and gossip in Islam 
There is a great deal of evidence to show that these actions are haram (impermissible). It will suffice for us to mention just a few of them in order to demonstrate that they are haram. 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Neither backbite one another. Would one of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother? You would hate it (so hate backbiting). And fear Allah. Verily, Allah is the One Who forgives and accepts repentance, Most Merciful” [Al-Hujurat:12] 
Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do you know what ghibah (backbiting) is?” They said, “Allah and His Messenger know best.” He said, “Saying something about your brother that he dislikes.” It was said, “What if what I say about my brother is true?” He said, “If what you say is true then you have backbited about him, and if it is not true, then you have slandered him.” [Muslim]
Ibn ‘Abbas said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) passed by two graves and said, “They are being punished, but they are not being punished for anything that was difficult to avoid. One of them used to walk about spreading malicious gossip (namimah), and the other used not to take precautions to avoid getting urine on himself when he urinated.” Then he called for a green branch, which he split in two and planted a piece on each grave, and said, “May their torment be reduced so long as these do not dry out.” [al-Bukhari, Muslim] 
For a person to say of another, “He cannot control his tongue (or he has a loose tongue)” is undoubtedly one of those things that a person would dislike to have said about him. If it is true, then it is ghibah (backbiting), and if it is not true then it is buhtan (slander). 
Expiation for backbiting, slander and gossip
Everyone who does any kind of backbiting , slander or malicious gossip has to repent and pray for forgiveness, and that is between him and Allah. 
If he knows that any of his words reached the person about whom he was speaking, then he should go to him and ask him to forgive him. 
But if he does not know, then he should not tell him; rather he should pray for forgiveness for him and make du’a (supplication) for him, and speak well of him in his absence just as he spoke against him. 
Similarly, if he knows that telling him will provoke more enmity, then it is sufficient to make du’a for him, speak well of him and pray for forgiveness for him. 
Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever has wronged his brother with regard to his honour or anything else, let him seek his forgiveness today, before there will be no dinar and no dirham, and if he has any good deeds to his credit they will be taken from him in a manner commensurate with the wrong he did, and if he has no good deeds, then some of his counterpart’s bad deeds will be taken and added to his burden.” [al-Bukhari] 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: 
Whoever wrongs a person by slandering him, backbiting about him or insulting him, then repents, Allah will accept his repentance, but if the one who was wronged finds out about that, he has the right to settle the score. 
But if he slandered him or backbit about him and the person did not hear of that, then there are two views according to the scholars, both of which were narrated from Ahmad, the more correct of which is that he should not tell him that he spoke against him in his absence. It was said that he should rather speak well of him in his absence just as he spoke badly of him in his absence, as al-Hasan al-Basri said: the expiation for ghibah is to pray for forgiveness for the person about whom you backbit.” (Majmu’ al-Fatawa)

Many of them, such as the short and very tight clothes, or light clothes, are incompatible with Islamic dress which involves the woman being completely covered. That includes pants, because they show the size of the woman’s legs, stomach and waist, etc. So wearing them comes under the same category as that mention in the saheeh hadeeth, “Two types of the people of Hell… women who are clothed yet naked.”
Majallat al-Da’wah, 1/1476
The woman who does that should be rebuked and reminded of the fearful punishment of Allah, and she should be called to repent.
It is not permissible to look at a woman when she is wearing these “naked” clothes, because Muslim (338) narrated from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No man should look at the ‘awrah of another man, and no woman should look at the ‘awrah of another woman.”
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
This shows that it is haraam for a man to look at the ‘awrah of another man and for a woman to look at the ‘awrah of another woman. There is no scholarly dispute on this point. Similarly it is haraam for a man to look at the ‘awrah of a woman and for a woman to look at the ‘awrah of a man, according to scholarly consensus.”
The prohibition on looking at a woman when she is in this state does not apply to the husband, because each spouse may look at the ‘awrah of the other, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And those who guard their chastity (i.e. private parts, from illegal sexual acts)
Except from their wives or (the slaves) that their right hands possess, * for then, they are free from blame”

Can we have sex in the night and take bath before doing the suhur?,"Intercourse during the day in Ramadan is haram for men and women while intercourse during the night in Ramadan is allowed. For more, please see the detailed answer.","Intercourse during the day in Ramadan 


Expiation for having intercourse during Ramadan


Intercourse during the night in Ramadan","Praise be to Allah.Intercourse during the day in Ramadan 
Intercourse during the day in Ramadan  is haram for men and women alike, who are obliged to fast during the day. Doing that is a sin for which expiation (kaffarah) must be offered. 
Expiation for having intercourse during Ramadan
The kaffarah is to free a slave; if that is not possible then the person must fast for two consecutive months; whoever is not able to do that must feed sixty poor persons. 
Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Whilst we were sitting with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), a man came to him and said, “O Messenger of Allah, I am doomed!” He said, “What happened?” He said, “I had intercourse with my wife when I was fasting [in Ramadan].” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Are you able to free a slave?” He said, “No.” He said, “Are you able to fast for two consecutive months?” He said, “No.” He said, “Can you feed sixty poor persons?'' He said, “No.” Then the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) remained silent for a while, and whilst we were like that, a large vessel of dates was brought to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and he said, “Where is the one who was asking?” He said, “Here I am.” He said, “Take these and give them in charity.” The man said, “Is there anyone more poor than me, O Messenger of Allah? For there is no household between the two harrahs (lava fields – i.e., in Madinah) that is poorer than my household.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) smiled until his eye teeth could be seen, then he said, “Feed it to your family.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1834, 1835; Muslim, 1111) 
Intercourse during the night in Ramadan 
With regard to intercourse during the night in Ramadan, this is permitted and is not forbidden, and the time when it is permitted lasts until the onset of dawn. When dawn comes, intercourse becomes forbidden. 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“It is made lawful for you to have sexual relations with your wives on the night of As-Sawm (the fasts). They are Libas [i.e. body-cover, or screen, or Sakan (i.e. you enjoy the pleasure of living with them] for you and you are the same for them. Allah knows that you used to deceive yourselves, so He turned to you (accepted your repentance) and forgave you. So now have sexual relations with them and seek that which Allah has ordained for you (offspring), and eat and drink until the white thread (light) of dawn appears to you distinct from the black thread (darkness of night), then complete your Sawm (fast) till the nightfall.” [al-Baqarah 2:187]
This verse clearly states that it is permissible to eat, drink and have intercourse during the nights of Ramadan until dawn. 
After having intercourse it is obligatory to do ghusl, then pray Fajr.

Depositing money in the bank in return for interest is riba (usury), which is a major sin. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Be afraid of Allah and give up what remains (due to you) from Ribaa (from now onward) if you are (really) believers.
279. And if you do not do it, then take a notice of war from Allah and His Messenger but if you repent, you shall have your capital sums. Deal not unjustly (by asking more than your capital sums), and you shall not be dealt with unjustly (by receiving less than your capital sums)” [Al-Baqarah 2:278-279]
If a Muslim is forced to put his money in the bank, because he cannot find any other means of keeping his money safe apart from putting it in the bank, then there is no sin in that, in sha Allah, subject to two conditions:
1-That he does not take any interest in return
2-That the bank does not deal only with interest, rather it should have some other activities that are permissible in which it invests the money deposited. See questions no. 22392 and 49677
It is not permissible to make use of the interest (riba) which the banks pay to their customers. They must get rid of it by donating it to charitable causes. 
The Scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas said:  
The interest which the banks pay to depositors on the money that they deposit in them is regarded as riba (usury). It is not permissible to make use of this interest, and the customer must repent to Allah from depositing his money in riba-based banks. He should withdraw the money that he deposited and the interest, keep the original amount and donate the extra to charity, to the poor and needy or for renovating public facilities etc. Fatawa Islamiyyah, 2/404 
And Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:

For a man to form an illicit relationship with a non-mahram woman is not just cheating on his wife, it is also a sin and an act of disobedience towards his Lord. Allaah has forbidden such relationships and has barred the ways that may lead to the greater form of immorality which is zina (unlawful sexual relationships), which is what is referred to in the question. 
The forbidden acts which people commit when they have such relationships are many and include being alone with that person (khulwah), shaking hands with them, looking at them, etc. These are sins which are forbidden in the texts in and of themselves, and because of the sin of zina to which they may lead. 
Secondly: 
For a Muslim woman to form an illicit relationship with a man who is not her mahram – whether he is married or not – is also a major sin and is worse than what is mentioned in the first part of the question, because it results in mixing of lineages and it makes the husband doubt whether his children are really his or not, which leads to a great deal of mischief. 
There follow the fatwas of some of the scholars concerning something that is less serious than meetings between the sexes, so what about things that are more serious? 
1 – Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: 
It is not permissible for any person to correspond with a woman who is not his mahram, because of the fitnah (temptation) involved in that.  The person who is sending these letters may think that there is no fitnah involved, but the Shaytaan will keep at him until he tempts the man by means of the woman and vice versa. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded those who hear the Dajjaal to keep away from him, and he said that a man may come to him as a believer, but the Dajjaal will keep at him until he tempts him and leads him astray. 
There is a great deal of temptation and danger in correspondence between young men and young women, so they must keep away from it, even  though the questioner may say that there is no love involved. 
Fataawa al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah, 2/578 
2 – Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah al-Jibreen said, when he was asked about corresponding with a non-mahram woman: 
This action is not permissible, because it will provoke desire between them and will make them want to meet one another. This kind of correspondence often causes fitnah (temptation) and plants the seeds of zina in the heart, which leads to evil actions. So we advise those who are seeking that which is in their own best interests and who wish to protect themselves to avoid writing to or speaking with non-mahrams, etc., so as to protect their religious commitment and their honour, and Allaah is the Source of help.

Sometimes, I like songs which are devoted to people, but what if I sing this song, as if I'm singing this to my Lord?",,,"Praise be to Allah.We have previously explained – in question no. 5000 and 5011 – the ruling on musical instruments, and that they are haraam according to the evidence of the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and according to the actions of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) and the words of the imams after them. This ruling applies to all kinds of music, even if it is accompanied by singing some words that have good meanings. Please review the answers to the questions mentioned. 
As for singing or humming a few (poetic) verses in which there is praise of Allaah or commending some good characteristics and other good meanings, the basic principle is that poetry is words; if the words are good it is good and if they are bad it is bad.  So if the words are free of any bid’ah or exaggeration that is condemned by sharee’ah, and it is free of any bad or ugly words that are inappropriate and should not be said of Allaah, then it is acceptable to sing such things occasionally, on condition that it is not done in the manner of singers and promiscuous people, because that is imitating people of immorality and sin (“and whoever imitates a people is one of them”). Hating those singers for the sake of Allaah implies that we should not resemble them or imitate their style of singing.
 With regard to some words or poems which were originally said about people, it is not correct to repeat them and devote them to Allaah. Rather the believer should glorify and venerate Allaah by reciting aayahs from the Qur’aan and dhikr as prescribed in sharee’ah, and du’aa’s narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), focusing on the greatness, majesty and glory of Allaah. If he occasionally recites some verses of poetry which praise Allaah and mention His blessings and bounty, there is nothing wrong with that so long as they meet the conditions mentioned above.

I'm afraid may be it means that we can not even take a picture of unanimated things also?",,,"Praise be to Allah.and blessings and peace 
    be upon the Messenger of Allaah.
    
    The majority of scholars say that it is 
    permissible to make pictures of inanimate objects such as trees, buildings, 
    etc, and they quote several texts as evidence for that, including the 
    following:

    The report narrated by al-Bukhaari (5963) 
    and Muslim (2110) from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him), who 
    said: “I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) say, ‘Whoever makes an image in this world will be told to 
    breathe life into it in the Day of Resurrection, and he will not be able to 
    do so.’” The prohibition mentioned in this hadeeth has to do with animate 
    objects. What confirms this interpretation is that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah 
    be pleased with him), who was the narrator of this hadeeth, issued a fatwa 
    permitting the drawing of trees and inanimate objects, as was narrated in 
    Saheeh al-Bukhaari (2225) and Saheeh Muslim (2110) from Sa’eed 
    ibn Abi’l-Hasan, who said: “I was with Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased 
    with him) when a man came to him and said, ‘O Ibn ‘Abbaas, I am a man who 
    earns a living by the work of my hands, and I make these pictures (or 
    images).’ Ibn ‘Abbaas said: ‘I will only tell you what I heard the Messenger 
    of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say, and I heard 
    him say, “Whoever makes an image in this world will be punished until he 
    breathes life into it, and he will never be able to do so.’’ The man became 
    very upset and his face turned pale. He – meaning Ibn ‘Abbaas – said, ‘Woe 
    to you! If you insist on making them (images), then you can make images of 
    these trees and everything that does not have a soul.’”

    In Saheeh al-Bukhaari (5181) and 
    Saheeh Muslim (2108) it is narrated that ‘Aa’ishah, the wife of the 
    Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The 
    Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    ‘The makers of these images will be punished on the Day of Resurrection and 
    it will be said to them: ‘Bring to life that which you have created!’” and 
    he said that the angels will not enter a house in which there are images.

    This hadeeth indicates that the punishment 
    has to do with images of animate beings, because the Prophet (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said that they will be told, “Bring to life 
    that which you have created!”

    With regard to the words of the Prophet 
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “Let them create a grain of 
    wheat or a grain of barley,” what is meant by that is to show that they are 
    incapable of doing so, because no matter what humans make that may resemble 
    these grains or plants in shape, they can never instill in them the 
    characteristics of these plants, so they cannot be planted and will never 
    grow, and so on. If humans are unable to create a single grain with some of 
    the characteristics that Allaah has created in it, then they are incapable 
    of breathing life into the images and statues that they make. Hence it 
    becomes clear that what is meant by the hadeeth is not that which may first 
    spring to mind, that making images of grains and trees and inanimate objects 
    is haraam, rather what is meant is to show that man is incapable as we have 
    mentioned above. And Allaah knows best.",Islam Q&A

The guest has rights, as the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said. There should be no doubt about this matter. If guests come without being invited, they should be

Yes, if they are bad friends or are those who 
    have nothing better to do and impose themselves on others all the time, then they should be treated in a manner that befits them, because they 
    annoy the people with their actions.  
But if it is your husband who is inviting a 
    lot of people to your house, then in this case you should speak to him in a gentle manner, and come to an agreement about how to invite people, so 
    that he will not invite anyone without speaking to you first, and you can agree to reduce the number of invitations in a suitable manner. 
You – may Allaah bless you – should not 
    express displeasure to your husband when the guests are there, because this is something that will make matters worse and will not solve the 
    problem. You have to be patient, because patience is the key to finding a way out. 
Strive to create a calm atmosphere in your 
    house, with good words and kind treatment. Some husband may resort to inviting a lot of friends over in an effort to relax, because their wives 
    may not be good at creating an atmosphere that suits their husbands, so that makes them look for this atmosphere with their friends. So try to 
    understand your husband’s nature so that you can create a suitable atmosphere that will make him happy and relaxed, which is what is he is looking 
    for with his friends.

According to a report narrated by Ahmad (3400): The Shaitan cannot resemble me.” 
Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar said: 
‘We have narrated it with a complete isnad from Isma’il ibn Ishaq al-Qadi from Sulayman ibn Harb – who was one of the shaykhs of al-Bukhari – from Hammad ibn Zayd from Ayyub who said: If a man told Muhammad (meaning Ibn Sirin) that he had seen the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) [in a dream], he would say, “Describe to me the one whom you saw.” If he gave a description that he did not recognize, he would say, “You did not see him.” Its isnad is sound, and I have found another report which corroborates it. Al-Hakim narrated via ‘Asim ibn Kulayb (who said), my father told me: I said to Ibn ‘Abbas, “I saw the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in a dream.” He said, “Describe him to me.” He said, “I mentioned al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali and said that he looked like him.” He said, “You did indeed see him.” Its isnad is good.” (Fath al-Bari, 12/383, 384)
Does Prophet Muhammad appear in all forms in dreams?
With regard to those who say that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) may appear in all forms [in dreams], quoting as evidence the report narrated by Ibn Abi ‘Asim from Abu Hurayrah, that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever sees me in a dream has indeed seen me, for I may be shown in all forms” – this hadith is da’if (weak). 
Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar said: 
“Its isnad includes Salih the freed slave of al-Tawamah, who is weak who became confused (in old age), and this is a report from someone who heard it after he became confused.” (Fath al-Bari, 12/384) 
Is it possible to see Prophet Muhammad in a dream as a young man or a child?
What is mentioned in the question about having seen the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) as a young man or a child is possible , but it is also subject to the conditions mentioned above, which is that he should look as he would have looked at that age. 
Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar said:  
“The phrase “[the Shaitan] cannot” indicates that although Allah gave him the ability to appear in any form he wants, He does not allow him to appear in the form of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). This was the opinion of a group who said concerning the hadith: What this refers to is when a person sees him as he really looked. 
Some of them restricted it even further and said: He must see him as he looked when he died, so he must even take into consideration the number of his white hairs which was no more than twenty. 
The correct view is that he may be seen at any age or in any condition, so long as he appears as he really looked at any time, whether as a youth, in the prime of manhood, in old age or any other time of his life.” (Fath al-Bari, 12/386) 
Can the Shaitan come to a person in his sleep and claim to be the Prophet ?
Once this is understood, it is possible for the Shaitan to come to a person in his sleep and claim to be the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), if he comes in a form other than the way in which Allah formed him at all stages of his life. 
The fact that there was a voice like in old times, or very handsome men, or someone who said “Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)” has nothing to do with seeing the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in his true form.

There were four people with him, two of whom died. All were unmarried. The family of the first forfeited the diyah (blood money) and did not take it. The father of the second took the full amount of diyah. The mother of the dead boy had died giving birth to him, and he was young, He had a paternal grandmother and a maternal grandmother. They were not given the diyah, because when the court ruled that diyah should be paid, they asked for witnesses to state whether he had heirs other than his father, and I was one of the witnesses. We testified that he had no heir apart from his father, because we were afraid that the court might demand that the grandmothers, who were very old, attend court, and because we were unaware of the rights of inheritance.

 What do I have to do, knowing that the father of the one who died is poor and has nothing?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Undoubtedly you have dome something which is a major sin, 
    namely giving false testimony or bearing false witness, especially since it 
    has caused the loss of rights of some of the heirs of the deceased.

    he sat up and said, “And false speech and false witness, and false speech 
    and false witness,” and he kept on saying it until I thought he would never 
    stop. 

    (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5631; Muslim, 87). 

    So we say to the brother who asked this question: if the 
    father has given the two grandmothers their share of the inheritance, then 
    you have to repent and seek forgiveness from Allaah for having given false 
    witness, but you do not have to go to the court and announce that. You have 
    to conceal that which Allaah has concealed.

     But if the father took all the money himself and did not 
    give the grandmothers their rightful share, then you must try to convince 
    him to give them what is their due. If he does that, then all well and good, 
    otherwise you have to go to the court, tell them that you lied, and suffer 
    the consequences of your sin. In this way you will restore to people what is 
    rightfully theirs.

     There is no expiation for false witness apart from 
    repentance and restoring people’s rights, if that false testimony resulted 
    in depriving others of what was rightfully theirs.

     The judge or qaadi has the right to impose whatever ta’zeer 
    punishment he sees fit for the one who bore false witness.

23388,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/23388,Paying interest because of inflation is riba,"I know that taking interest is haraam,but I would like to know what does islaam say about taking interest based on inflation.For example,if you borrow 50 pounds and you want to return the 50 pounds in 5 years time,the value of the 50 pounds that you borrowed would be higher in 5 years time.Therefore you payback the equivalent amount to the 50 pounds that you borrowed.I ask this question because I want to know if it is allowed for me to take out a student loan which has interest based on inflation.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
If you borrow 50 pounds from a person or an institution for a period of five years, you have to pay back this amount in the same currency, even if its value goes down (because of inflation), so long as transactions in this currency are still valid.  
We have already explained in Question no. 12541 that paying extra on a loan because of devaluation of the currency is haraam and is regarded as a kind of interest. This is the view of the majority of fuqaha’. 
Secondly: 
Whoever takes a loan in one currency and agrees to pay back in another, has fallen into riba, because what he has really done is to sell one kind of currency now in return for another currency to be paid later on. This is haraam and is one of the two kinds of riba which is called riba al-nasi’ah. 
But the borrower may agree with the lender – at the time of repaying the loan – to hand over the money in a different currency. In the example referred to above, when five years have passed and you have to pay back 50 pounds, you can agree with the lender – on the day of paying back – to give him the equivalent in another currency, such as dollars, but that is subject to the condition that it be at the exchange rate that is current on the day you pay it back. 
Thirdly: 
With regard to taking a loan with interest based on inflation. We have already stated that paying interest on a loan to make up for inflation is haraam, and that it is a kind of riba. Based on this, it is not permissible for you to take this loan, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed the one who consumes riba, the one who pays it, the one who writes it down and the two who witness it. He said: “They are all the same.” Narrated by Muslim, 1598.

 Im asking this question because my husband has chosen to work to help other muslims with their deen and his parents do not agree. His father wants him to go back home and get a job on his original profession. I do not know what to do since his father wants me to convince my husband to do so. I am the only one in the family who supports my husband's choices for the sake of Allah. I have renounced my rights as a wife to allow him to proceed with his work.

 What should be my behaviour? I do not wnat to disobey my father-in-law but I do not want to interfere in my husband's choices for life. We both have agreed with a simple life.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    There is no doubt that Allaah has enjoined obedience towards 
    parents. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Say (O Muhammad): ‘Come, I will recite what your Lord has 
    prohibited you from: Join not anything in worship with Him; be good and 
    dutiful to your parents; kill not your children because of poverty’ — We 
    provide sustenance for you and for them. Come not near to Al-Fawaahish 
    (shameful sins and illegal sexual intercourse) whether committed openly or 
    secretly; and kill not anyone whom Allaah has forbidden, except for a just 
    cause (according to Islamic law). This He has commanded you that you may 
    understand”

    [al-An’aam 6:151]

    It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with 
    him) said: A man came to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) and said, “O Messenger of Allaah, who is most deserving of my good 
    companionship?” He said, “Your mother.” He asked, “Then who?” He said, “Your 
    mother.” He asked, “Then who?” He said, “Your mother.” He asked, “Then who?” 
    He said, “Your father.”

    (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5626; Muslim, 2548). 

    It is haraam to disobey one's parents. It was narrated that 
    al-Mugheerah ibn Shu’bah said: The Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah has forbidden you to disobey your mothers, 
    to bury infant girls alive, to withhold the rights of others, to demand what 
    is not rightfully yours, to pass on everything that you hear, to ask too 
    many questions and to waste money.”

    (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2277; Muslim, 593) 

    Working for Islam is obligatory upon a Muslim as much as he 
    is able to. Your husband may have to stay in the country to serve the 
    Muslims, teach them and take care of their affairs. Therefore your husband 
    should not go back to his country and give up calling people to Allaah and 
    working for the ummah. A man asked Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may 
    Allaah have mercy on him): 

    For a number of years I have been teaching people to memorize 
    Qur’aan in a place far away from the city in which my parents live, and they 
    are asking me to stop teaching and work with one of my brothers who live 
    with them. I am hesitant about this matter because I am afraid that if I 
    stop teaching, the students will be neglected and will forget the Qur’aan 
    that they have memorized. What to you advise me to do? May Allaah reward you 
    with good. 

    He replied: 

    We advise you to continue teaching Qur’aan memorization, 
    because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “The best of you are those who learn the Qur’aan and teach it to others” 
    (narrated by Imaam al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh); and because that is in 
    the general interests of the Muslims. You do not have to obey your parents 
    in giving that up, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) said: “Obedience is only with regard to what is good and 
    proper.” But it is prescribed for you to explain that to them in a kind and 
    polite manner. 

    And Allaah is the Source of strength.

    Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 
    5/412 

    Secondly: 

    Your husband could obey his parents and return to his country 
    if there is someone who could take his place in working for Islam there and 
    if there is also a need to work for Islam in the country where his family 
    is. In this manner he can do two things at once, fulfilling his father’s 
    wishes and also working for Islam. His own country may be in greater need, 
    and his staying in the country where he is now may not allow him to practise 
    Islam openly or raise his children in Islam.

     But if your husband will be coming back to work in his 
    specialty without working for Islam, then you should be on his side and 
    encourage him to stay and work for Islam. Undoubtedly this will be good for 
    you in religious terms, if not in worldly terms. For what is with Allaah is 
    better and more lasting. We should also note that a person is not like a 
    candle and should not burn himself to provide light for others. If the 
    environment in which he is does not help him to obey Allaah and give your 
    children a sound Islamic upbringing, then try to change it and move to a 
    good environment where your children can grow up in Islam. May Allaah help 
    us all to do that which He loves and which pleases Him. And Allaah knows 
    best.",Islam Q&A

    your patience and for fulfilling your husband’s desires in obedience to the command of your Lord. 
The solution to the problem you mention is by 
    speaking frankly. That does not mean embarrassing your husband or accusing him of being inconsiderate. This problem often stems from the fact that 
    the husband is not aware that there is a problem at all, not from the fact that he is inconsiderate. The husband may go ahead and have intercourse 
    and not pay attention to some things that he should be doing, one of which is fulfilling his wife’s needs. Perhaps you could benefit by reading 
    some books on the topic which explain the basis of the relationship and intimacy between a man and a woman such as Tuhfat al-‘Aroos by 
    Mahmood Mahdi Istanbuli. 
The point is that there is nothing wrong with 
    speaking to your husband about this matter, and suggesting that he read about it. Speaking frankly is preferable to suffering in this manner, and 
    the problem can be solved easily. 
This does not excuse the woman from sharing 
    some of the responsibility. She also has things that she must do, such as adorning herself for her husband, being loving towards him and 
    encouraging him to be intimate with her.

23397,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/23397,Meaning of the verse “And raise the dust in clouds the while” [al-‘Aadiyaat 100:4 – interpretation of the meaning],"I would like to know the most accurate translation of one of the Quranic Ayah in English.  The Surrah number is 100 and the Ayah number is 4.
My questions are:

1.  Is the Arabic words raised, dust, in, and clouds found in that Ayah?

2.  If yes, then what are the words in Arabic that are used in Quran 100:4 as raised, dust, in, and clouds?

3.  If there is any translator of the Quran who has translated Ayah 100:4 most accurately, what is his/her name?

4.  Can you please list all the Arabic words that are used in Ayah 100:4 separately along with the English translation?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    1 – The words “raise” and “dust” are present in the meaning 
    of the verse. The word “in” is not present as such, but this meaning is 
    indicated because dust can only be raised “in” the air. The word “clouds” is 
    not present as such and is not implied by the wording. 

    2 – The word “raise” has many synonyms in the Qur’aan, such 
    as the following: 

    (a)Al-Nash’ 
    (bring up, originate, rise), as in the verses (interpretation of the 
    meaning):

    “And it is He Who brings up (or originates) [yunshi’] the 
    clouds, heavy (with water)”

    [al-Ra’d 13:12]

    “Verily, 
    the rising [naashi’ah] by night (for Tahajjud prayer) is very hard and most 
    potent and good for governing oneself, and most suitable for (understanding) 
    the Word (of Allaah)”

    [al-Muzzammil 73:6]

    (b)al-Hadab 
    (mound, hill), as in the verse (interpretation of the meaning):

    “Until, when Ya’jooj 
    and Ma’jooj (Gog and Magog people) are let loose (from their barrier), and 
    they swoop down from every mound [hadab]”

    [al-Anbiya’ 21:96]

    Al-Farra’ said: (this means) from every hill and elevated 
    place. 

    (c)al-‘Urooj 
    (ascent), as in the verse (interpretation of the meaning):

    “The angels and the 
    Rooh [Jibreel (Gabriel)] ascend [ta’ruju] to Him in a Day the measure 
    whereof is fifty thousand years”

    [al-Ma’aarij 70:4].

    This means: ascending or rising up. 

    (d)al-Mawj 
    (wave), as in the verse (interpretation of the meaning):

    “So it (the ship) 
    sailed with them amidst waves [mawj] like mountains”

    [Hood 11:42]

    Mawj refers to water rising 
    above water. 

    (e)al-Rabwah 
    (high ground), as in the verse (interpretation of the meaning):

    “And We made the son of Maryam (Mary) and his mother as a 
    sign, and We gave them refuge on high ground [rabwah], a place of rest, 
    security and flowing streams”

    [al-Mu’minoon 23:50]

    The word rabwah refers to an elevated place. 

    (f)al-Nashz 
    (rising up), as in the verse (interpretation of the meaning):
“O you who believe! 
    When you are told to make room in the assemblies, (spread out and) make 
    room. Allaah will give you (ample) room (from His Mercy). And when you are 
    told to rise up [anshuzu] [for prayers, or Jihaad (holy fighting in Allaah’s 
    Cause), or for any other good deed], rise up”

    [al-Mujaadilah 58:11]

    Nushooz means rising up 

    With regard to the word dust, another word with the same 
    meaning is also used in the Qur’aan, which is the word haba’, as in 
    the verses (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And We shall turn to whatever deeds they (disbelievers, 
    polytheists, sinners) did, and We shall make such deeds as scattered 
    floating particles of dust [haba’]”

    [al-Furqaan 25:23]

    With regard to the word “clouds”, several synonymous words 
    are used in the Qur’aan, such as the following: 

    (a)al-mu’siraat 
    (rain clouds), as in the verses (interpretation of the meaning):

    “And We have sent down from the rainy clouds 
    [al-mu’siraat] abundant water”

    [al-Naba’ 78:14]

    (b)al-muzn 
    (rain clouds), as in the verses (interpretation of the meaning):
“Is it you who 
    cause it from the rain clouds [al-muzn] to come down, or are We the Causer 
    of it to come down?”

    [al-Waaqi’ah 56:69]

    3 – One of the best commentaries on the Qur’aan in general, 
    in the sense that it includes all kinds of tafseer (commentary) and is based 
    on sound belief is the Tafseer of al-Tabari among the earlier 
    scholars and the Tafseer of Ibn Katheer among the later scholars. 

    In his commentary on the verse: 

    “And raise the dust in clouds the while” 

    [al-‘Aadiyaat 100:4 – interpretation of the meaning]

    al-Tabari said: “Fa atharna bihi naq’an (translated 
    here as ‘And raise the dust in clouds the while’)” means, they raise up dust 
    (or dust clouds) in the valley. 
The ha’ in the 
    word bihi alludes to a noun of place which is not mentioned 
    specifically, because it is known that dust can only be stirred up from a 
    place, and the listeners will understand that with no need to mention it 
    specifically. 

    The mufassireen said something similar to that which we have 
    mentioned. 

    Tafseer al-Tabari, 30/275, 276 

    Ibn Katheer said in his commentary on the same verse:

     The word ghubaar means a battle ground where horses 
    fight.

    Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 
    4/542.

     The verse word-for-word is as follows:

    Fa atharna bihi naq’an

     Fa atharna

    Then 
    they (the horses) raised in clouds

    Bihi

     In it (i.e., in the place where the horses are running) 
Naq’an

     The dust.
