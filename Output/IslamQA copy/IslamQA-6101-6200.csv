          Sahl ibn Sa’d said: the people used to be instructed to place the right 
          hand over the left forearm when praying. (narrated by al-Bukhaari, no. 
          740)
 It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may 
          Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “We Prophets have 
          been commanded to delay our suhoor and to break our fast straight away, 
          and to place our right hands over our left hands when praying.” (narrated 
          by Ibn Hibbaan in al-Saheeh, 3/13-14).
 From these two ahaadeeth it is clear 
          to us that the one who puts his hands by his sides in prayer is making 
          a mistake. Putting the right hand over the left hand is the teaching 
          of our Prophet  (peace and blessings 
          of Allaah be upon him) and of the Prophets who came before him.
 (See Zaad 
          al-Ma’aad, 1/202)
 Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said:
 Nothing to the contrary has been narrated  
          from the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
          of Allaah be upon him), and this is the view of the majority of the 
          Sahaabah and Taabi’een. This is what was mentioned by Maalik in al-Muwatta’, 
          and Ibn al-Mundhir and others did not narrate any differing view from 
          Maalik… (See al-Fath, 2/224; Nayl al-Awtaar, 
          2/201)
 The Maalikis said, concerning the report 
          about holding one hand with the other in fard and naafil prayers, that 
          this is the more correct meaning, because people were commanded to do 
          this during the earliest generations (See al-Qawaaneen, 
          65).  
What is well-known 
          from the later books of the Maalikis is that it is recommended for the 
          worshipper to place the hands below the chest and above the navel, in 
          both naafil and fard prayers. If a person does this with the intention 
          of following the Sunnah, or with no specific intention,this is fine, 
          but if his intention is to lean on his hands or find a more comfortable 
          position by putting one hand on top of the other, then this is makrooh.
 Al-Baaji, one of the prominent Maalikis, 
          said: “It may be that Maalik said that placing one hand on top of the 
          other is makrooh because he was afraid that the common people would 
          believe that this was one of the esential pillars of the prayer and 
          that prayer would be invalid if one did not do this.”  
Anyone who thinks 
          about this matter will realize for certain that they all acknowledge 
          that the Sunnah of the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is for the worshipper to 
          place his hands on his front, not to hold them by his sides. Whatever 
          Imaam Maalik said about holding the hands by one's side – if indeed 
          the reports from him are saheeh – was only to counteract an action that 
          was not prescribed in the Sunnah, which was leaning on the hands, or 
          an incorrect belief, i.e., the belief of the common people that this 
          was obligatory. It was said that when Maalik (may Allaah have mercy 
          on him) refused to accept the position of qaadi (judge), he was beaten, 
          and he could not put his hands on his chest when praying, so he held 
          them by his sides because of the pain. Some of those who saw that thought 
          this was Sunnah so they transmitted this from him. But he (may Allaah 
          have mercy on him) definitely did not say that the arms should be held 
          by one’s side at all. This is a misunderstanding of some written statement 
          and it goes against what he stated clearly in al-Muwatta’ 
          about the right hand being placed on top of the left. This was explained 
          by a group of Maalikis and others, in various books which number approximately 
          thirty, apart from what is mentioned in various commentaries. 
Moreover, if it were 
          proven that Maalik did hold his arms by his side for no reason, which 
          is more deserving of being followed, the actions and words of the Prophet 
           (peace and blessings of Allaah 
          be upon him), as mentioned in the ahaadeeth quoted above, or the words 
          of Imaam Maalik?  
Every seeker of the 
          truth will follow the Sunnah of Muhammad  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and give it priority over 
          the views of anyone else.

Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“It is He Who made the sun a shining thing and the moon as a light and measured out for it stages that you might know the number of years and the reckoning. Allah did not create this but in truth. He explains the signs in detail for people who have knowledge.” [Yunus 10:5]
“And from among His Signs are the night and the day, and the sun and the moon. Prostrate yourselves not to the sun nor to the moon, but prostrate yourselves to Allah Who created them, if you (really) worship Him.” (Fussilat 41:37)
Is Salat al-Kusuf sunnah?
Salat al-Kusuf is a confirmed Sunnah according to the consensus of the scholars. The evidence for this is the Sunnah reported from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)
Eclipses are signs from Allah
Eclipses are signs from Allah by means of which Allah makes His slaves afraid . Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And We sent not the signs except to warn, and to make them afraid (of destruction)” [al-Isra 17:39]
How was Salat al-kusuf legislated?
When the sun was eclipsed at the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), he went out rushing nervously to the mosque, dragging his cloak behind him, and led the people in prayer. He told them that the eclipse was one of the signs of Allah, with which Allah makes His slaves afraid, and that it may be the cause of punishment coming upon the people. He commanded them to do that which could prevent the punishment, so he commanded them to pray when an eclipse happens, and to make du`a, seek His forgiveness, give charity, free slaves and do other righteous deeds so that the punishment would go away and not befall the people. So the eclipse is a reminder to people, making them afraid so that they will turn back to Allah and pay attention to Him.
Divine wisdom behind the occurrence of eclipses
During the Jahiliyyah, people used to believe that eclipses happened to mark the birth or death of a great person, but the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) declared this belief to be false and explained the divine wisdom behind the occurrence of eclipses:
Imam al-Bukhari and Muslim narrated that Ibn Mas’ud al-Ansari said: the sun was eclipsed the day Ibrahim, the son of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) died, and the people said, The sun is eclipsed because of the death of Ibrahim. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: The sun and the moon are two signs from Allah, and they do not become eclipsed for the death or the birth of anyone. If you see that, hasten to remember Allah and to pray.
According to another hadith in al-Sahihayn, “Call on Allah and pray until [the eclipse] is over.”
It is reported in Sahih al-Bukhari that Abu Musa said: These signs that Allah sends are not for the death or life of anyone, but Allah makes His slaves afraid through them, so if you see anything of that [eclipses], then hasten to remember Allah and call on Him and seek His forgiveness.
Allah causes eclipses to happen to these two mighty signs, the sun and the moon, to teach His slaves and show them that these things are created and are subject to imperfections and changes just like any other created entities. Thus He shows them His perfect ability and that He Alone is deserving of worship, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And from among His Signs are the night and the day, and the sun and the moon. Prostrate yourselves not to the sun nor to the moon, but prostrate yourselves to Allah Who created them, if you (really) worship Him.” (Fussilat 41:37)
The time for Salat al-Kusuf
The time for Salat al-Kusuf lasts from the beginning of the eclipse until it is over, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: When you see that, then pray. (Agreed upon) According to another hadith, “If you see anything of that, then pray until it is over.” (Reported by Muslim)
Salat al-Kusuf should not be done once the eclipse is over, because the time has gone. If an eclipse ends before one knows about it, one does not have to pray, because the reason for this prayer is no longer there.
How to perform Salat al-Kusuf
The way in which  Salat al-Kusuf is done is to pray two Rak’ahs in which Quran is recited aloud, according to the correct one out of the two scholarly opinions. 
In the first Rak’ah, one should recite al-Fatihah and a long surah such as Surat al-Baqarah or the equivalent, then do a long ruku’, then raise one's head and say, Sami’a Allahu liman hamidah, Rabbana wa lakal-hamd (Allah listens to the one who praises Him; our Lord to You be praise) after standing upright, as in other prayers. 
Then one should then recite al-Fatihah and another long surah, shorter than in the first recitation, equivalent in length to Surat Al ‘Imran. Then one should do another long ruku’ shorter than the first, and when raising one's head, say, Sami’a Allahu liman hamidah, Rabbana wa lakal-hamd hamdan kathiran tayyiban mubarakan fih, mil al-samawati wa mil al-ard wa mil ma shita min shayin ba’d (Allah listens to the one who praises Him; our Lord to You be praise, much good and blessed praise, filling heaven and earth and whatever You will besides that). 
Then he should do two lengthy sujuds, without making the sitting between them too long. Then one should pray the second rak’ah like the first, with two long ruku’s and two long sujuds, as he did in the first rak’ah. Then he should recite the Tashahhud and say the salam.
This is the description of Salat al-Kusuf as prayed by the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), as was reported with a number of isnads. Some of these reports are in al-Sahihayn, including the hadith narrated by ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her): The sun was eclipsed at the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went out, stood up and said Takbir (Allahu akbar), and the people formed rows behind him. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) recited a lengthy recitation and did a lengthy ruku’, then he raised his head and said, Sami’a Allahu liman hamidah, Rabbana wa lakal-hamd. Then he stood upright and recited another lengthy recitation, shorter than the first. Then he said Allahu akbar and did another lengthy ruku’, shorter than the first. Then he said, Sami’a Allahu liman hamidah, Rabbana wa lakal-hamd. Then he did sujud. Then in the second rak’ah he did likewise, until he had completed four ruku’s and four sujuds, and the eclipse was over before he had finished. (Agreed upon)
Can you pray salat al-kusuf in congregation?
It is sunnah to pray Salat al-Kusuf in congregation, because this is what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did, but it is permissible to pray it individually, as with all other nafl prayers. However, praying it in congregation is better.
Should the imam give khutbah after salat al-kusuf?
It is sunnah for the imam to address the people after the prayer, and to warn them against negligence and being led astray, and to tell them to make lots of du’a and ask for forgiveness. In al-Sahih it is narrated from ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) finished his prayer then addressed the people and started by praising Allah then he said, The sun and the moon are two of the signs of Allah, and they do not become eclipsed for the death or the birth of anyone. If you see that, then call on Allah, perform salah, give charity
Should you repeat salat al-kusuf if the eclipse does not end?
If the prayer ends before the eclipse does, then remember Allah (dhikr) and call on Him (du’a) until the eclipse ends. The prayer should not be repeated. If the eclipse ends before the prayer, then the prayer should be completed quickly, but it should not be stopped or cut off abruptly, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “and render not vain your deeds [Muhammad 47:33]. The prayer should be at the time of the eclipse, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “until it (the eclipse) is over and he also said, until what you are going through is over.”
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: 
“Sometimes eclipses last for a long time, and sometimes for a short time, depending on how much of the sun or moon is eclipsed. The entire sun or moon may be eclipsed, or only half of it, or one-third. If it is a total eclipse, then the prayer should last long enough for all of al-Baqarah or something of similar length to be recited in the first rak’ah, and in the next rak’ah a shorter recitation is made. There are authentic hadiths narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), as we have mentioned, and it is prescribed to shorten the prayer if the reason for it [i.e., the eclipse] is no longer there. So if it is known that the eclipse will not last for long, or if it started to get less, one should still pray, but the prayer should be shortened. This is the opinion of the majority of scholars, because this prayer is prescribed for a specific reason, and if the reason is no longer there and the eclipse is over, one should not pray.”

How about athan and the Iqamah.",,,"Praise be to Allah.In Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah wa’l-Buhooth (6/392) it says the following:
It was reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to recite aloud in the two Rak’ahs of Subh (Fajr), and in the first two rak’ahs of Maghrib and ‘Ishaa’. So reciting aloud in these cases is Sunnah, and it is prescribed for his Ummah to follow his example, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Indeed in the Messenger of Allah you have a good example to follow for him who hopes in (the Meeting with) Allah and the Last Day and remembers Allah much.” [al-Ahzaab 33:21].
It was reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Pray as you have seen me praying.”
Reciting silently when one is supposed to recite aloud implies that one is neglecting the Sunnah, even though this does not invalidate the prayer.
So the Muslim should recite aloud during Fajr prayer and in the first two rak’ahs of Maghrib and ‘Ishaa’, even if he is praying alone, because this is the Sunnah.
He should not recite aloud during Zuhr and ‘Asr. He should recite aloud during the first two rak’ahs of Maghrib and ‘Ishaa’, and in the fard of Fajr prayer, and he should recite silently in the third Rak’ah of Maghrib and in the last two rak’ahs of ‘Ishaa’. These times of reciting aloud or silently are mustahabb when praying alone, according to Imaam al-Shaafa’i and others. The Hanbalis say: the person who is praying alone has the choice of reciting aloud at the appropriate points; if he wants to he may recite aloud, and if he wants to he may lower his voice.
(al-Mufassal li Ahkaam al-Mar’ah by ‘Abd al-Kareem Zaydaan, p. 330).
With regard to the second part of your question, in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah wa’l-Buhooth (6/56) its says:
It is permissible for a person praying alone to pray without the Adhan, but if he is in the desert or on a remote farm and the like, it is prescribed for him to recite the Adhan even if he is going to pray alone, and the Iqaamah is prescribed at all times, because of the general meaning of the evidence, and because Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri said to ‘Abd-Allah al-Ansaari: “I see that you like sheep and the wilderness. When you are with your sheep in your wilderness, and you recite the Adhan for your prayers, raise your voice, for no jinn or man or anything within the voice range of the muezzin hears the call, but will bear witness for him on the Day of Resurrection.” Abu Sa’eed said: I heard this from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).

      you have knowledge and understanding of the religion of Allaah that
      enables you to call others to Allaah and teach the people good things, and
      refute specious arguments and practise your religion openly among the
      kaafirs around you, then it is OK, because if a person who is as we have
      described and who has equipped himself with knowledge stays there, he can
      benefit himself and others. Allaah may guide many people through him if he
      strives hard in da’wah and is patient, and his intention is sincerely
      for Allaah alone. But if a person does not have this religious
      understanding or he does not have the patience for da’wah, or he fears
      that he may fall into things which Allaah has forbidden, or he cannot
      practise his religion openly by calling others to worship Allaah alone and
      warning them against shirk and explaining that to the people around
      him, then it is not permissible for him to stay among the mushrikeen,
      because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:

6190,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6190,The Approach of the Hour,Is the day of Judgement near as everyone seems to be committing so many sins at the moment?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Draws near for mankind their reckoning, while they turn away
    in heedlessness.” [al-Anbiyaa’ 21:1]
Ibn Katheer said in his Tafseer/exegesis (3/172): Here Allaah is pointing
    out that the Hour is approaching and is at hand, and that people are unaware of it, i.e.,
    they are not working and preparing for it.
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“The Event (the Hour or the punishment of disbelievers and
    polytheists or the Islamic laws or commandments) ordained by Allaah will come to pass, so
    seek not to hasten it. Glorified and Exalted be He above all that they associate as
    partners with Him” [al-Nahl 16:1].
Ibn Katheer said in his Tafseer (2/560): 
Here Allaah tells us about the approach of the Hour and that it is at
    hand. The fact that it is expressed in the past tense [in the original Arabic] indicates
    that it is true and will undoubtedly come to pass.
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has been cleft
    asunder” [al-Qamar 54:1]
Ibn Katheer said in his Tafseer (4/360):
Here Allaah tells us of the approach of the Hour and the passing of
    this world.
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“It is Allaah Who has sent down the Book (the Qur’aan) in
    truth, and the Balance (i.e., to act justly). And what can make you know that perhaps the
    Hour is close at hand?” [al-Shoora 42:17]
At-Tirmidhi reported in As-Sunan (1980 – with as-Saheeh) that the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
    “How can I enjoy life when the bearer of the horn (or trumpet) has
    put the horn to his lips and is listening, waiting for the command to blow?” It was
    as if this was difficult for the companions of the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah
    be upon him) to hear, so he said to them:
“Say: Hasbuna Allaah wa ni’am al-wakeel, ‘ala Allaah
    tawakkalnaa (Sufficient for us is Allaah, and He is the Best Disposer of affairs, in
    Allaah we put our trust).”
Ahmad and Muslim narrated that Ibn Mas’ood said: the Messenger of
    Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The Hour will only come
    upon the most evil of people.” (Narrated by Muslim, no. 5243, and by Ahmad,
    no. 3548).
    Ahmad and al-Bukhaari narrated that Mardaas al-Sulami
    said:
The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
    “The righteous people will vanish, the best first, then the next best and so on, and
    there will be left worthless chaff like the chaff of barley or dates, and Allaah will not
    care about them at all.” (See al-Jaami’ al-Saheeh, 7934).
    Ahmad and the two Shaykhs (al-Bukhaari and Muslim)
    narrated that Anas said: I shall tell you a hadeeth which no one else will tell you after
    I am gone. I heard the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)
    say:
“Among the signs of the Hour are: knowledge will be reduced,
    ignorance will prevail, zinaa will be widespread, and there will be many women and few
    men, until for fifty women there will be one guardian.” (Narrated by
    al-Bukhaari, no. 79 –this version was narrated by him. Also narrated by Muslim, no.
    4825; Ahmad, no. 12735; and al-Tirmidhi, no. 2131).
    At-Tabaraani narrated that Sahl ibn Sa’d said: the
    Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
“At the end of time there will be earthquakes, falling rocks from the sky, transmutation into animals [or disfigurement, deformity], when stringed instruments and
    female singers will be widespread, and wine will be permitted.” (Saheeh
    al-Jaami’, 3665).
    All of these texts clearly indicate that the Hour is
    approaching and that an abundance of sin and evil is one of its signs. The disbelievers think that the Hour is unlikely to happen and that it is taking too long, but the fact of the
    matter is as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Verily! They see it (the torment) afar off, But We see it
    (quite) near.” [al-Ma’aarij 70:6-7].

6194,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6194,Is it permissible to sell to drunken customers?,My father has grocery shop and sometimes we have drunken customers that come in. I would like to know if it is permissable to deal with such customers and if by doing so it breaks wuduu as some of them smell strongly of alcohol or have cans of beer in their hand which they are drinking.,,,"Praise be to Allah.We put the following question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn
    Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen:
A shopkeeper doing business in the West has Christians who come in,
    drunk or staggering, to buy things that are permissible. Is it permissible for him to sell
    to them?
He replied, may Allaah preserve him:
Yes, so long as they are Christian.
Question:
Why?
Answer:
It is permissible because the Christians believe that it is permissible
    to drink alcohol.
Question:
The question in our minds is that one of the two parties [engaged in
    the transaction] is not in his right mind.
Answer:
Does he not know how to make a purchase?
Question:
There are different types of drunkenness: a person may or may not be
    aware that he is buying something.
Answer:
If they are in such a state that they do not know (what they are
    doing), then it is not permissible to deal with them.
Question:
But if he is drunk and does know what he is doing?
Answer:
Then there is nothing wrong with it, as it says in the aayah
    (interpretation of the meaning):
“Approach not As-Salaah (the prayer) when you are in a drunken
    state until you know (the meaning) of what you utter” [al-Nisaa’ 4:43]

I understand that, but what do you do if you don't know your father's last name. Should you keep that name of your mother's family? I currently have my mother's family name. I plan to change my first name to an Islamic name, should I do the same for my last name?",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is haraam for a person to call himself after anyone other than his father, or after people to whom he does not belong. This was stated in the saheeh hadeeth narrated from Abu Dharr, who heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: There is no one who knowingly calls himself after someone other than his father, but he is guilty of Kufr
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3371; Muslim, 61).
According to the version narrated by al-Bukhaari: who calls himself after people to whom he does not belong
Falsely attributing a person to people he does not belong to results in violation of the laws of Mahram (close blood ties dictating who is and is not permissible for marriage), inheritance, custody, guardianship in marriage, etc.
With regard to what should be done, we put this question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-Uthaymeen, may Allaah preserve him, who answered as follows:
She cannot take the name of anyone other than her family, and it is not permissible to do so. She has to change her name.
If she does not know her fathers name or family, she can call herself by a general name such as Faatimah bint Abd-Allaah or Faatimah bint Abd al-Rahmaan.

    (rough translation) stating when Ad-Dajjal comes there will be eight gates in Madina, and
    each gate will have two angels as a guard to prevent Dajjal to enter Madina.
As far as my knowledge goes Madina at this present time do not have any
    gates, but only paths.
  My question is does the word gate in the hadith refers to pathways, if
    it does then how many pathways are there to Madina.",,,"Praise be to Allah.There is a mistake in the quoting of the hadeeth in
    question. The hadeeth was narrated by al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) in his Saheeh,
    in Kitaab Fadaa’il al-Madeenah (the Book of the Virtues of Madeenah, 1879) and
    in Kitaab al-Fitan (The Book of Tribulations, 7125), from the hadeeth of Abu Bakrah
    (may Allaah be pleasaed with him), who narrated that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him) said:
“The feeling of terror of the Dajaal will not enter Madeenah. At
    that time it will have seven gates, at each of which will be two angels.”
Ibn Hajar al-‘Asqallaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in
    his footnote on this hadeeth, with regard to the phrase “At that time it will have
    seven gates”:
‘Iyaad said: this supports the idea that what is meant here by
    gates is paths, as in the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah. It was reported in al-Saheeh
    from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
    him) said:
On the pathways of Madeenah there are angels, and neither the plague
    nor the Dajjaal will enter it.
Al-Haafiz said in Al-Fath (4/96): “Al-Anqaab
    (pathways) is the plural of Naqab… Ibn Wahb said: what is meant by this is
    entrances, or it was said that it means gates. The original meaning of Naqab was a
    path between two mountains. It was said that al-anqaab were the routes which people
    followed, as in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):
“… they ran for a refuge (naqqabu) in the land” [Qaaf
    50:36]
This is all that al-Haafiz said in his commentary on the gates. There
    is still room for ijtihaad on this issue, and it could mean for example:
That Madeenah will have gates in the future when the Dajjaal comes, even
        though it does not have gates at the present time.

That what is meant by gates is the main entrances to the city, even if
        they do not take the form of gates.

That the angels who are appointed to guard it are covering seven points,
        at each of which there are two angels, and the points were described as gates – which
        is acceptable in Arabic.
