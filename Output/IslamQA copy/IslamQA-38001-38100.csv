38007,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/38007,He started fasting in London and broke his fast in Riyadh,"With regard to fasting, I started fasting in London and broke my fast in Riyadh. What is the ruling on the time difference?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Your fast is valid, because with regard to breaking the fast, what matters is the place where the fasting person is 
    when the sun sets; the time difference does not matter, whether the day is long or short. 
In Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (10/296) it says: 
The scholars are unanimously agreed that the fast lasts from dawn until sunset, 
    and each person who fasts is subject to the rulings on the place where he is, whether he is on the ground or in a plane that is in the air. 
In another fatwa (10/295): 
The basic principle is that with regard to starting to fast, breaking the fast and 
    the time of prayer, each person is subject to the ruling of the land he is in or the air through which he is travelling. If the plane he is in 
    takes off a few minutes before sunset and the day continues for him, it is not permissible for him to break his fast or to pray Maghrib until the 
    sun sets from the point of view of the air through which he is travelling, even if he passes through the airspace of a city whose people have 
    broken the fast and prayed Maghrib, so long as he can see the sun. 
Based on this, whoever starts to fast then travels in a plane towards the west 
    should break his fast when the sun sets in the place where he is. Similarly if he travels by plane towards the east and wants to fast, he should 
    not break his fast until the sun sets in the place where he is. The time difference does not matter.

38013,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/38013,Her husband cannot have intercourse with her because of the pain she feels. What is the solution?,"I apologize for this question,but I feel really bad. I am a muslim sister and married for 2 months now. The problem is this: I love my husband very much but every time when we have intercourse he can't put his penis in my vagina. It hurts so much for me. I know this is called frigidity. I had a bad youth, an uncle touched me when I was young and I know I cant have intercourse with my husband because my uncle did this to me. My husband is very patience with me and very sweet,but he don't know what to do either. Can you please help me?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The husband has to be gentle with his wife if intercourse is painful for her or causes her psychological difficulty. He has to be patient with her until she recovers from her problem or gets used to him and feels at ease with him, and she herself wants it as much as he does. 
Ibn Hazm said: 
Slaves and free women are obliged not to prevent their masters or husbands having intercourse with them when they call them, so long as the woman who is called is not menstruating or sick and will not be harmed by having intercourse, or is observing an obligatory fast. 
Al-Muhalla, 10/40. 
This matter is undoubtedly difficult, especially for one who is recently married, but it is better than causing problems that will wreck married life. The sister mentions that she loves her husband; he should take note of that and use it to fulfil his desires in a permissible manner. 
We advise the husband to read the answer to question no. 5560, which explains the matter further. 
The wife should also try to treat herself, physically and mentally. She should not give in to the psychological pain or be a prisoner of the past. Her husband is not her evil uncle who abused her when she was small. Now she is a grown up and she is with her husband, and they are permissible for one another. 
With regard to the physical pain, this is something natural when one is first married. This pain will soon go away, in sha Allah. All it needs is a little patience. 
You should both make a lot of du’aa’ and strive to follow the commands of Allaah by regularly performing the obligatory duties, observing the commands of Allaah on time and adhering to what He enjoins with regard to dress etc. All of that may be a means of Allaah hastening to relieve you and remove whatever psychological and other barriers may be present.

38021,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/38021,Is Tarawih Prayer Bid`ah?,"On the occasion of the blessed month of Ramadan, the people turn to Tarawih prayer. My question is: there are some who pray eleven rak’ahs immediately after ‘Isha’ prayer, following the example of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him); and there are those who pray twenty-one rak’ahs, ten after ‘Isha’ and ten before Fajr, then they pray Witr. What is the Shar’i ruling on this way of praying Tarawih? Please note that there are those who say that praying Qiyam before Fajr is Did’ah. May Allah reward you with good.","•	How can Tarawih prayer be a Bid`ah when the Prophet encouraged us to do it and the Muslims unanimously agreed that it is recommended!? 
•	The Prophet prayed Tarawih in congregation with his companions for many nights, then he stopped doing that lest it be made obligatory upon the Muslims.
•	The time for Tarawih prayer is from after `Isha’ prayer until dawn comes and there is no specific number of rak`ahs for Tarawih prayer.","Is Tarawih Prayer Bid`ah?


Is gathering to offer Tarawih prayer in the mosques Bid`ah?


Number of Rak`ahs in Tarawih prayer","Praise be to Allah.Is Tarawih Prayer Bid`ah?
Tarawih prayer is Sunnah according to the consensus of the Muslims, as Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Majmu’. 
Tarawih prayer was encouraged by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), for example when he said: “Whoever spends the nights of Ramadan in prayer out of faith and in the hope of reward, his previous sins will be forgiven.” Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 37; Muslim, 760 
So how can Tarawih prayer be a Bid`ah when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) encouraged us to do it and the Muslims are unanimously agreed that it is recommended!? 
Is gathering to offer Tarawih prayer in the mosques Bid`ah?
Perhaps the one who said that Tarwaih prayer is Bid`ah meant that gathering to offer Tarawih prayer in the mosques is Bid`ah. 
This too is incorrect, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed Tarawih in congregation with his companions for many nights, then he stopped doing that lest it be made obligatory upon the Muslims. Then when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) died and the revelation came to an end, this concern was no longer an issue, because it could not be made obligatory after the death of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). So `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) gathered the Muslims to pray Tarawih in congregation .
The time for Tarawih prayer is from after `Isha’ prayer until dawn comes. 
Number of Rak`ahs in Tarawih prayer
There is no specific number of Rak`ahs for Tarawih prayer , rather it is permissible to do a little or a lot. The two ways mentioned in the question are both permissible. 
That should be based on whatever the people in each mosque think is suitable for them. 
However, the best is that which was proven from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), which is that he never prayed more than eleven Rak’ahs when praying Qiyam Al-layl, in Ramadan or at other times. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said, after mentioning the number of Rak'ahs in Tarawih prayer:
“The matter is broad in scope. No one should be denounced for praying eleven or twenty-three, because the matter is broader in scope than that, praise be to Allah.” (Fatawa Al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 1/407)

Things that do not invalidate your fast


References:","Praise be to Allah.Allah has prescribed fasting in accordance with the highest wisdom. 
He has commanded the fasting person to fast in a moderate manner, so he should not harm himself by fasting or consume anything that will invalidate the fast. 
Types of things that invalidate the fast
Hence the things that invalidate the fast are of two types: 
1- Some of the things that invalidate the fast involve things coming out of the body, such as intercourse, deliberate vomiting, menstruation and cupping. These things that come out of the body weaken it. Hence Allah has described them as being things that invalidate the fast, so that the fasting person will not combine the weakness that results from fasting with the weakness that results from these things, and thus be harmed by his fast or his fast no longer be moderate.
2- And some of the things that invalidate the fast involve things entering the body, such as eating and drinking. If the fasting person eats or drinks, he does not achieve the purpose of fasting. (Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 25/248)
Allah has summed up the things that break the fast in the verse where He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So now have sexual relations with them and seek that which Allah has ordained for you (offspring), and eat and drink until the white thread (light) of dawn appears to you distinct from the black thread (darkness of night), then complete your Sawm (fast) till the nightfall.” [al-Baqarah 2:187]
In this verse Allah mentions the main things that invalidate the fast, which are eating, drinking and intercourse. The other things that break the fast were mentioned by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in his Sunnah. 
7 Things invalidate your fast
There are seven things that break the fast, as follows: 

Intercourse
Masturbation
Eating and drinking
Anything that is regarded as coming under the same heading as eating and drinking
Letting blood by means of cupping and the like
Vomiting deliberately
Menstruation and nifaas

Intercourse
The first of the things that invalidate the fast is: intercourse.
This is the most serious and the most sinful of the things that invalidate the fast. 
Whoever has intercourse during the day in Ramadan deliberately and of his or her own free will, in which the two circumcised parts meet and the tip of the penis disappears in either of the two passages, has invalidated his fast, whether he ejaculates or not. He has to repent, complete that day (i.e., not eat or drink until sunset), make up that day’s fast later on and offer a severe expiation. The evidence for that is the hadith narrated by Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: A man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, “I am doomed, O Messenger of Allah!” He said, “Why are you doomed?” He said, “I had intercourse with my wife (during the day) in Ramadan.” He said, “Can you free a slave?” He said, “No.” He said, “Can you fast for two consecutive months?” He said, “No.” He said, “Can you feed sixty poor persons?” He said, “No.”… (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1936; Muslim, 1111)
No expiation is required for any of the things that break the fast apart from intercourse. 
Masturbation
The second of the things that invalidate the fast is masturbation.
This means causing ejaculation or climax by using the hand etc. 
The evidence that masturbation is one of the things that invalidate the fast is the words of Allah in the hadith qudsi in which He says of the fasting person: “He gives up his food and drink and desire for My sake.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1894; Muslim, 1151) Causing ejaculation comes under the heading of the desire which the fasting person gives up. 
Whoever masturbates during the day in Ramadan has to repent to Allah and refrain from eating and drinking for the rest of the day, and he has to make up that fast later on.  
If he starts to masturbate then stops without ejaculating, he has to repent, but his fast is still valid, and he does not have to make it up later because he did not ejaculate. The fasting person should keep away from everything that provokes desire and shun bad thoughts. 
With regard to the emission of madhiy (prostatic fluid), the most correct view is that it does not invalidate the fast. 
Eating or drinking 
The third of the things that invalidate the fast is eating or drinking 
This refers to food or drink reaching the stomach via the mouth. 
If anything reaches the stomach via the nose, this is like eating or drinking. 
Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Snuff up water deeply into the nose (when doing wudu), except when you are fasting.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 788)
If water reaching the stomach via the nose did not invalidate the fast, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would not have told those who are fasting not to snuff up water deeply into the nose. 
Anything that is regarded as coming under the same heading as eating and drinking
The fourth of the things that invalidate the fast is anything that is regarded as coming under the same heading as eating and drinking 
This includes two things: 
1.      Transfusion of blood to one who is fasting – such as if he bleeds heavily and is given a blood transfusion. This invalidates the fast because blood is formed from food and drink.
2.      Receiving via a needle (as in the case of a drip) nourishing substances which take the place of food and drink, because this is the same as food and drink. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin, Majalis Shahr Ramadan, p/ 70.
With regard to injections which do not replace food and drink, rather they are administered for the purpose of medical treatment – such as penicillin or insulin – or are given to energize the body, or for the purpose of vaccinations , these do not affect the fast, whether they are intravenous or intramuscular (injected into a vein or a muscle). (Fatawa Muhammad ibn Ibrahim, 4/189) But to be on the safe side, these injections may be given at night. 
Kidney dialysis, in which blood is extracted, cleaned and then returned to the body with the addition of chemical substances such as sugars and salts etc. is regarded as invalidating the fast. (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 10/19)
Letting blood by means of cupping 
The fifth of the things that invalidate the fast is letting blood by means of cupping 
Because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The cupper and the one for whom cupping is done have both invalidated their fast.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 2367; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud, 2047)
Donating blood comes under the same heading as cupping, because it affects the body in the same way. 
Based on this, it is not permissible for a person who is fasting to donate blood unless it is essential, in which case it is permissible. In that case, the donor has broken his fast and must make up that day later on. (Ibn ‘Uthaymin, Majalis Shahr Ramadan, p. 71)
If a person suffers a nosebleed, his fast is valid, because that happened involuntarily. (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 10/264)
With regard to bleeding that results from extraction of a tooth, surgery or a blood test etc., that does not invalidate the fast because it is not cupping or something that is similar to cupping, unless it has an effect on the body similar to that of cupping. 
Vomiting deliberately 
The sixth of the things that invalidate the fast is vomiting deliberately 
Because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever vomits involuntarily does not have to make up the fast, but whoever vomits deliberately let him make up the fast.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 720, classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi, 577)
Ibn al-Mundhir said: The scholars agree that the fast of one who vomits deliberately is invalidated. (Al-Mughni, 4/368)
Whoever vomits deliberately by sticking his finger in his throat, pressing his stomach, deliberately smelling something nasty or persisting in looking at something that makes him vomit, has to make up his fast later on. 
If his gorge rises, he should not suppress it, because that will harm him. (Majalis Shahr Ramadan, Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, p. 71) 
The blood of menses and nifas 
The seventh of the things that invalidate the fast is the blood of menses and nifas 
Because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Is it not the case that when she gets her period, she does not pray or fast?” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 304) 
When a woman sees the blood of her period or nifas (postpartum bleeding), her fast becomes invalid even if that is one moment before sunset. 
If a woman feels that her period has started but no blood comes out until after sunset, her fast is still valid. 
If the bleeding of a woman who is menstruating or in nifas ceases at night and she has the intention of fasting, then dawn comes before she does ghusl, the view of all the scholars is that her fast is valid. Al-Fath, 4/148. 
It is preferable for a woman to keep to her natural cycle and to accept that which Allah has decreed for her, and not to take any medicine to prevent her period. She should accept what Allah has decreed for her of not fasting during her period, and make up for those days later on. This is what the Mothers of the Believers and the women of the Salaf used to do. (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 10/151)
In addition, it has been medically proven that these means of preventing menstruation are harmful and many women have suffered menstrual irregularities as a result. If a woman takes pills and her period stops as a result, that is fine, she can fast and her fast is acceptable.  
These are things that invalidate the fast. All of them – apart from menses and nifas – only invalidate the fast if three conditions are met: that the person was aware of the ruling and not ignorant of it; that he did it knowingly and not out of forgetfulness; and that he did it by choice and was not forced to do it. 
Things that do not invalidate your fast
We should also note some things that do not invalidate the fast: 
1.      Enemas, eyedrops, eardrops, tooth extraction and treatment of injuries do not invalidate the fast. (Majmu’ Fatawa Shaykh al-Islam, 25/233; 25/245)
2.      Medical tablets that are placed under the tongue to treat asthma attacks etc, so long as you avoid swallowing any residue. 
3.      Insertion of anything into the vagina such as pessaries, or a speculum, or the doctor’s fingers for the purpose of medical examination. 
4.      Insertion of medical instruments or IUD into the womb. 
5.      Anything that enters the urinary tract of a male or female, such as a catheter tube, or medical scopes, or opaque dyes inserted for the purpose of x-rays, or medicine, or a solution to wash the bladder. 
6.      Fillings, extractions or cleaning of the teeth, whether with a siwak or toothbrush, so long as you avoid swallowing anything that reaches the throat.  
7.      Rinsing the mouth, gargling, sprays etc. so long as you avoid swallowing anything that reaches the throat.  
8.      Oxygen or anaesthetic gases, so long as that does not give the patient any kind of nourishment. 
9.      Anything that may enter the body via absorption through the skin, such as creams, poultices, etc.  
10.   Insertion of a fine tube via the veins for diagnostic imaging or treatment of the veins of the heart or any part of the body. 
11.   Insertion of a scope through the stomach wall to examine the intestines by means of a surgical operation (laparoscopy). 
12.   Taking samples from the liver or any other part of the body, so long as that is not accompanied by administration of solutions. 
13.   Endoscopy, so long as that is not accompanied by administration of solutions or other substances. 
14.   Introduction of any medical instruments or materials to the brain or spinal column.

Anas ibn Maalik said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to break his fast with fresh dates before he prayed; if there were no fresh dates, then with dried dates; if no dates were available then with a few sips of water.

“It is by His wisdom that Allah has prescribed a variety of acts of worship, so as to test people with regard to how they will obey all these commands. Will they only choose to do that which suits them, or will they do that which pleases Allah? If we think about the five acts of worship: testimony of faith, prayer, zakah, fasting and pilgrimage, we will see that some of them are purely physical, some are purely financial, some are both, so that the miser will become distinct from the generous. For some people it may be easy for them to pray one thousand rak’ahs but not to give a single dirham; for others it may be easy to give a thousand dirhams but not to pray a single rak’ahs. So Islam came to prescribe a variety of acts of worship so as to determine who will follow in obedience to the command of Allah and who will follow only that which suits him. 
Prayer , for example, is a purely physical action, but its prerequisites require some expenditure, such as the water for wudu, and clothes to cover the ‘awrah. These are not part of the prayer but they are its prerequisites. 
Zakah is purely financial, but physical actions are required to fulfil this duty such as calculating one's wealth and transferring the zakah to the poor and needy. These are not part of zakah but they are its prerequisites.   
Hajj involves spending wealth and physical action, except for the people of Makkah who may not need money, but they are very few compared with those who live in Makkah. 
Jihad for the sake of Allah may require both money and physical effort. A person may spend money for the sake of Allah and not fight, or he may go and fight but not spend money. 
Commands are of two types: commands to refrain from things that man is inclined towards, and commands to spend that are precious.
Refraining from things that are loved includes fasting, and expenditure of things that are loved includes zakah. Wealth is something that is loved and no one spends the wealth that he loves except for something that is loved even more. 
The same applies to refraining from things that are loved, for a person may like to spend a thousand dirhams, but not fast a single day, or vice versa.” (Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin, al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 6/190) 
Thirdly: 
Wisdom of prescribing fasting in Islam
There is another great reason why fasting is prescribed, which has been discussed in part in the answer to question no. 26862 . 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin was asked about the reason why fasting was enjoined? 
He replied: 
“If we read the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“ O you who believe! Observing As-Sawm (the fasting) is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, that you may become Al-Muttaqun (pious).” [al-Baqarah 2:183] 
we will know the reason why fasting was prescribed, which is taqwa (piety) and submission to Allah. Taqwa means giving up haraam things, and in general terms includes both doing what is commanded and abstaining from what is forbidden. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does not give up false speech and acting upon it and offensive speech and behaviour, Allah has no need of his giving up his food and drink.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 6057( See also questions no. 37658  and 37989 . 
Things to avoid while fasting
Based on this, it is important for the one who is fasting to carry out religious duties and avoid haram things in word and deed. So he should not backbite about people, tell lies, or spread malicious gossip among them, or engage in haraam transactions, and he should avoid all haraam things. 
If a person does that for a whole month, the rest of the year will go well, but unfortunately in the case of many of those who fast, there is no difference between a day when they fast and a day when they do not; they behave as they usually do, neglecting obligatory duties and doing forbidden things. You do not see the dignity that is to be expected of the fasting person. These actions do not invalidate their fast but they do detract from its reward and may cancel out the reward altogether. (Fatawa Arkan al-Islam, p. 451)

38068,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/38068,When Does Suhur Time End?,"In reference to question 12602 , where you stated that stopping eating about 5 minutes before fajr (when fasting) is a form of bid'ah. I found the following hadith in Al-Bukhari: Narrated Anas: Zaid bin Thabit said ""We took the sahur with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Then he stood for prayer."" I asked, ""What was the interval between the sahur and the adhan?"" He replied ""The interval was sufficient to recite fifty verses of the Quran."" Chapter 13, 3:144. Reciting 50 verses should take about 5 or 10 minutes, even more. So how is it a bid'ah to stop eating 5 minutes before fajr?",It is recommended to delay suhur and it is not recommended to stop eating and drinking a while before Fajr. Allah has permitted those who intend to fast to eat and drink until they are certain that dawn has come.,"End of Suhur time


When to stop eating and drinking in Ramadan


Should we stop eating and drinking 20 minutes before Fajr?","Praise be to Allah.End of Suhur time
Al-Bukhari (1921) narrated from Anas that Zayd ibn Thabit said: “We ate suhur with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), then he stood up to pray.” I [Anas] said: “How long was there between the adhan and suhur?” He said: “As long as it takes to recite fifty verses.”
This hadith indicates that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to eat suhur this amount of time before the adhan, not that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) started to fast and stopped eating and drinking this amount of time before Fajr. 
There is a difference between the time of suhur and the time of stopping eating and drinking . This is clear, praise be to Allah. It is like saying, “I ate suhur two hours before Fajr.” This does not mean that you started fasting from that time, rather you are simply stating what time you ate suhur at. 
What may be understood from the hadith of Zayd ibn Thabit (may Allah be pleased with him) is that it is mustahabb to delay suhur and it is not mustahabb to stop eating and drinking a while before Fajr. 
Allah has permitted those who intend to fast to eat and drink until they are certain that dawn has come. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and eat and drink until the white thread (light) of dawn appears to you distinct from the black thread (darkness of night), then complete your Sawm (fast) till the nightfall.” [al-Baqarah 2:187]
“So it is permissible to have intercourse, eat and drink during the nights of Ramadan from the beginning of the night until dawn comes, then we are commanded to complete the fast until night comes.” (Abu Bakr al-Jassas in Ahkam al-Quran, 1/265) 
Al-Bukhari (1919) and Muslim (1092) narrated from ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that Bilal used to give the adhaan at night, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Eat and drink until Ibn Umm Maktum calls the adhan, for he does not call the adhan until the dawn comes.” 
Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmu’ (6/406): 
“Our companions and other scholars agree that suhur is Sunnah, and that delaying it is preferable. The evidence for all of that is the sahih ahadith. And because suhur and delaying suhur helps one to fast, and they involve being different to the disbelievers. Moreover the time for fasting is the day, so there is no sense in delaying iftar or refraining from eating suhur at the end of the night. 
When to stop eating and drinking in Ramadan
The Standing Committee (10/284) was asked: I read in some tafsirs that the fasting person should stop eating and drinking 20 minutes before the adhan of Fajr, and this is described as being on the safe side. How much time should there be between stopping eating and drinking and the adhan of Fajr in Ramadan? What is the ruling on one who hears the muadhdhin saying “al-salatu khayrun min al-nawm (prayer is better than sleep)” and he says that he can still drink so long as the adhan is still going on. Is this correct? 
They replied: 
The basic principle regarding when the fasting person should stop eating and drinking and should break the fast is the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“…and eat and drink until the white thread (light) of dawn appears to you distinct from the black thread (darkness of night), then complete your Sawm (fast) till the nightfall.” [al-Baqarah 2:187]
It is permissible to eat and drink until the dawn appears, which is the white thread of light that Allah has made the latest time when it is permissible to eat and drink. When the second dawn appears, it is haram to eat and drink and do other things that break the fast. Whoever drinks whilst hearing the adhan for Fajr , if the adhan comes after the second dawn, then he has to make up that day, but if that was before dawn, then he does not have to make it up.” 
Should we stop eating and drinking 20 minutes before Fajr?
Shaykh Ibn Baz was asked about making the time for stopping eating and drinking approximately fifteen minutes before Fajr . He replied: 
“I do not know of any basis for this, rather what is indicated by the Quran and Sunnah is that we should stop eating and drinking when dawn comes, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“…and eat and drink until the white thread (light) of dawn appears to you distinct from the black thread (darkness of night), then complete your Sawm (fast) till the nightfall.” [al-Baqarah 2:187]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Dawn is of two types, a dawn when it becomes haram to eat and permissible to pray, and a dawn when you should not pray [i.e., Fajr prayer] and it is permissible to eat.” (Narrated by Ibn Khuzaymah and al-Hakim, who classed it as sahih in Bulugh al-Maram)
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Bilal calls the adhan at night, so eat and drink until Ibn Umm Maktum gives the call to prayer.” The narrator said: Ibn Umm Maktum was a blind man who did not give the call to prayer until someone said to him, ‘Morning has come, morning has come.’” (Sahih – agreed upon) (Majmu’ Fatawa Ibn Baz, 15/281)

Does masturbation without ejaculation break the fast?","Praise be to Allah.Does masturbation break the fast?
Masturbation is one of the things that invalidates the fast, and the one who does that has to make up for the day that he broke his fast. He must also repent from this great sin. 
Shaykh Ibn Baz said: 
“Masturbation during the day in Ramadan invalidates the fast if it is done deliberately and semen is emitted as a result. The person must make up the day if that was an obligatory fast, and he must repent to Allah, because masturbation is not permissible whether one is fasting or not. It is an action which people call the ‘secret habit’. “ (Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 15/267)
Does masturbation without ejaculation break the fast?
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“If a fasting person masturbates and ejaculates , this breaks his fast, and he has to make up the fast of the day on which he masturbated, but he does not have to offer any expiation, because the expiation is only required of one who has intercourse. And he has to repent from what he did.” (Fatawa Arkan al-Islam, p. 478) 
This applies if he masturbated and ejaculated; if he did not ejaculate then this does not break the fast. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’ (6/388):  
“If he masturbated without ejaculating, this does not invalidate the fast.” 
And Allah knows best.",Islam Q&A
38079,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/38079,Minimum Distance for Breaking Fast and Shortening Prayers,What is the minimum distance of travelling at which fasting is excused?,"The distance which allows a traveller to break his fasting and shorten his prayers is approximately 80 km according to the view of the majority of scholars. This distance is called travelling according to the custom of the Muslims. So if a person travels by camel, car, plane or ship, for this distance or more, he is regarded as a traveller.",,"Praise be to Allah.The majority of scholars are of the view that the distance at which a traveller may join prayers and not fast is forty-eight miles. 
Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Mughni: 
The view of Abu `Abd-Allah [i.e., Imam Ahmad] is that it is not permissible to shorten the prayers for a distance of less than sixteen Farsakhs, and a Farsakh is three miles, so the distance is forty-eight miles . This was the estimation of Ibn `Abbas. He said: From `Usfan to Makkah, or from Al-Taif to Makkah, or from Jeddah to Makkah.” 
Based on this, the distance at which it is permissible to shorten prayers is the distance of two days’ travel aiming directly for that destination. This is the view of Ibn `Abbas and Ibn `Umar, and the view of Malik, Al-Layth and al-Shafi`i. 
The equivalent in kilometres is approximately 80 km. 
Shaykh Ibn Baz said in Majmu` Al-Fatawa (12/267), explaining what is meant by travelling: 
“The view of the majority of scholars is that this is equivalent to approximately eighty kilometres for one who travels by car, plane or ship. This distance is what is called travelling according to the custom of the Muslims. So if a person travels by camel, car, plane or ship, for this distance or more, he is regarded as a traveller.” 
The Standing Committee was asked (8/90) about the distance at which a traveller may shorten his prayers, and can a taxi-driver who covers more than three hundred kilometres shorten his prayer? 
They replied: 
“The distance at which a traveller may shorten his prayers is approximately 80 km according to the view of the majority of scholars. It is permissible for a taxi driver or anyone else to shorten his prayers, if he is going to cover the distance mentioned at the beginning of the question, or more.” 
Some scholars are of the view that travelling is not to be defined by a specific distance, rather it should be defined according to custom: whatever people customarily regard as travelling is the travelling to which the Shar`i rulings apply, such as joining and shortening prayers, and not fasting . 
Shaykh Al-Islam said in Al-Fatawa (24/106): 
“The evidence supports those who regard shortening prayers and not fasting as being applicable to all types of travel and do not single out one kind of travelling to the exclusion of another. This view is the correct one.” 
Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin was asked in Fatawa Arkan Al-Islam (p. 381) about the distance at which a traveller may shorten his prayers and whether it is permissible to join prayers without shortening them. 
He replied: 
“The distance at which a traveller may shorten his prayers was defined by some of the scholars as being approximately eighty-three kilometres, and some defined it as being what is customarily regarded as travelling, even if the distance is not 80 km, and that what the people say is not travelling should not be regarded as such, even if it is as far as one hundred kilometres. 
The latter view is the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him), because Allah did not state a specific distance that makes shortening prayers permissible, and neither did the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: If the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) set out for a journey of three miles or three farsakhs, he would pray two Rak`ahs. (Narrated by Muslim, 691) 
The view of Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah is closer to what is correct. 
There is nothing wrong, if there is a conflict between customary views, in going by the opinion which suggests that travel should be defined in terms of distance, because this was the view of some of the Imams and scholars and Mujtahids. So there is nothing wrong with that in sha Allah. But so long as custom gives a clear definition, then referring to what is customary is the right thing to do.”
