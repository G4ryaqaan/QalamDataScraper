This is narrated in the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) who said that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) placed the deceased in the grave he would say (and according to another version, he said: When you place your dead in the graves say:) “BismIllah wa ‘ala sunnati Rasool-Illah”; according to another report: “wa ‘ala millati Rasool-Illah.” 
This was narrated by Abu Dawood, 3213; al-Tirmidhi, 1046; Ibn Maajah, 1550; al-Haakim, 1353; classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Ahkaam al-Janaa’iz, p. 192. 
After completion of the burial it is Sunnah to pray for forgiveness for the deceased and pray for him to be made steadfast, because of the hadeeth of ‘Uthmaan ibn ‘Affaan (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had finished burying the deceased he would stand over him and say: “Pray for forgiveness for your brother, and ask that he be made steadfast, for now he is being questioned.” 
Narrated by Abu Dawood, 3221; classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Ahkam al-Janaa’iz, p. 198. 
Standing over him means standing over his grave. 
“and [said]: Pray for forgiveness for your brother” means: ask for forgiveness for him from Allah, i.e., say: “O Allah forgive him.” 
“and ask that he be made steadfast” means: ask Allah to make his tongue steadfast in answering the two angels, i.e., say: “O Allah make him steadfast in speech.” 
“for now he is being questioned” i.e., at that moment the two angels are coming to him, namely Munkar and Nakeer, so he is in the greatest need of prayers for forgiveness and steadfastness.",Islam Q&A
47924,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47924,Expiation for committing adultery with a married woman,What is the expiation for one who committed adultery with a married woman?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Zina (adultery) is 
      nothing but evil. But with a married woman it is a greater sin because 
      that is a transgression against the husband’s honour. Allaah says 
      concerning zina (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And come not near to unlawful sex. Verily, it is a 
    Faahishah (i.e. anything that transgresses its limits: a great sin), and an 
    evil way (that leads one to hell unless Allaah forgives him)”

    [al-Isra’ 17:32]
The Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If a man commits 
    zina, faith will come out of him until it becomes like a cloud over him, and 
    when he stops, his faith comes back to him.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 4690; 
    al-Tirmidhi, 2625; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 

    Ibn Hajar al-Haythami said in al-Zawaajir ‘an Iqtiraaf 
    al-Kabaa’ir (2/138): Thus it is also known that there are different 
    categories of zina. If it is done with a non-mahram woman who has no husband 
    it is a serious matter. It is more serious if it is with a non-mahram woman 
    who has a husband; it is more serious still if it is with a mahram. The zina 
    of a previously-married person is worse than zina of a virgin, which is 
    indicated by the fact that the punishment is different. And the zina of an 
    old man who is of sound mind is worse than the zina of a young man, and the 
    zina of a free man or a knowledgeable man is worse than the zina of a slave 
    or one who is ignorant. End quote. 

    The expiation for committing zina with a married woman or any 
    other is sincere repentance that fulfils all the conditions of repentance. 
    That involves giving up the sin completely, regretting what one has done and 
    resolving never to go back to it. Whoever does that has repented to Allaah, 
    and whoever repents, Allaah will accept his repentance and turn his bad 
    deeds into good deeds, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Know they not that Allaah accepts repentance from His 
    slaves and takes the Sadaqaat (alms, charity), and that Allaah Alone is the 
    One Who forgives and accepts repentance, Most Merciful?”

    [al-Tawbah 9:104] 

    “And those who invoke not any other ilaah (god) along with 
    Allaah, nor kill such person as Allaah has forbidden, except for just cause, 
    nor commit illegal sexual intercourse  
    and whoever does this shall receive the punishment.

    69. The torment will be doubled to him on the Day of 
    Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace;

    70. Except those who repent and believe (in Islamic 
    Monotheism), and do righteous deeds; for those, Allaah will change their 
    sins into good deeds, and Allaah is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful”

    [al-Furqaan 25:68-70]

    Al-Bukhaari (4436) and Muslim (174) narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas 
    (may Allaah be pleased with him) that some people from among the mushrikeen 
    who had killed and killed a great deal, and committed zina and done it a 
    great deal came to Muhammad  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    and said: “What you are saying and calling us to is good, if only you could 
    tell us that there is any expiation for what we have done.” Then the words
    “And those who invoke not any other ilaah (god) along with Allaah, nor 
    kill such person as Allaah has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit 
    illegal sexual intercourse” [al-Furqaan 25:68] and “Say: O ‘Ibaadi 
    (My slaves) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil 
    deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allaah” [al-Zumar 39:52] 
    were revealed. 

    Whoever falls into zina must hasten to repent to Allaah and 
    conceal himself with His concealment, and not disclose what he has done, 
    because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “Avoid this filthy thing that Allaah has forbidden, and whoever commits any 
    sin of that nature let him conceal himself with the concealment of Allaah.” 
    Narrated by al-Bayhaqi and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah 
    al-Saheehah, 663. 
Muslim (2590) narrated 
    from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah does not cover any 
    slave in this world but Allaah will also cover him on the Day of 
    Resurrection.”

47951,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47951,Is it permissible to use the expression “greetings” or “best wishes”?,"At the end of official communications between government departments it says “with my compliments (la lakum tahiyyaati)” or “with our compliments (wa lakum tahiyyaatuna).” But it is well known that al-tahiyyaat (greetings or compliments) are only for Allaah alone, with no partner or associate. [As said in the tashahhud in prayer].  What is your opinion on that?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
      There is nothing wrong with one person saying to another, 
      “with my compliments (la lakum tahiyyaati)” or “with our 
      compliments (wa lakum tahiyyaatuna)” and other such phrases. 

    With regard to the tahiyyaat that are for Allaah alone, that 
    refers to perfect tahiyyaat, as in the tashahhud in prayer: “Al-tahiyyaatu 
    Lillaahi wa’l-salawaat wa’l-tayyibaat (all compliments, prayers and pure 
    words are for Allaah).” 

    But there is nothing wrong with the greetings or compliments 
    that are given by one person to another. 

    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have 
    mercy on him) was asked about these words, “arjuka (I hope that 
    you…)”, “tahiyyaati (my compliments)”, “an’am sabaahan (good 
    morning)” and “an’am masaa’an (good evening)”. 

    He replied: 
There is nothing wrong 
    with saying to someone, “I hope that you…” with regard to something that he 
    can fulfil your hope in. The same applies to saying, “My compliments to you” 
    and so on, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “When you are greeted 
    with a greeting, greet in return with what is better than it, or (at least) 
    return it equally”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:86]
Similarly there is 
    nothing wrong with saying “Good morning” or “Good evening” etc, so long as 
    these are not adopted as greetings instead of the salaam that is prescribed 
    in sharee’ah. 

    Al-Manaahi al-Lafziyyah 
    (question 8). 

    In questions 9 and 20, the Shaykh was also asked about the 
    phrases “with our best wishes (wa lakum tahiyyaatuna)” and “I give 
    you my compliments (uhdi lakum tahiyyaati).” 

    He replied: 

    There is nothing wrong with the phrases “with our best wishes 
    (wa lakum tahiyyaatuna)” and “I give you my compliments (uhdi 
    lakum tahiyyaati)” and other similar phrases. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “When you are greeted 
    with a greeting, greet in return with what is better than it, or (at least) 
    return it equally”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:86]
It is 
    permissible for one person to give greetings or compliments (tahiyyaat) to 
    another, but tahiyyaat in the general sense belongs to Allaah, as we also 
    say “Praise be to Allaah”, and “Thanks be to Allaah,” but at the same time 
    it is also valid to say, “I praise So and so for doing such and such” and “I 
    thanked him such and such”. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):

Never despair of Allah’s mercy


Will I be punished even if I repent from zina?","Praise be to Allah.Repentance: Your way to forgiveness
We praise Allah for having enabled your friends to repent, and we ask Him to reward them and make them steadfast. Undoubtedly the immoral actions that they committed are causes of Allah's punishment in this world and in the Hereafter, but there is the hope that sincere repentance from this action, regret for what was done, resolve not to do it again, and weeping for having sinned against Allaah and violated the sanctity of the Muslims will all be good for this repentant person and will be the cause of his or her bad deeds being turned to good deeds. 
Never despair of Allah’s mercy
This sister’s repentance should not lead her to despair of the mercy of Allah, for the Shaytan will exploit this and will prevent her from repenting and doing good deeds. 
It is good that she regrets what she did and weeps and repents and prays for forgiveness, out of recognition of the seriousness of the sin that she and her husband committed. But it is not good for her to despair of the mercy of Allah and think badly of Him, may He be exalted. 
Our Lord has told us that He forgives all sins, no matter how great they are or how many, if we repent to Him, and He has forbidden us to despair of His mercy, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say: O ‘Ibadi (My slaves) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allah, verily, Allah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful” [al-Zumar 39:53]
And He has told us that He will turn evil deeds to good deeds for the one who is sincere in his repentance, even if he has committed shirk and murder and zina, which are the gravest of sins. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And those who invoke not any other ilah (god) along with Allah, nor kill such person as Allah has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse -- and whoever does this shall receive the punishment.
The torment will be doubled to him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace;
Except those who repent and believe (in Islamic Monotheism), and do righteous deeds; for those, Allah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful” [al-Furqaan 25:68-70]
Will I be punished even if I repent from zina?
Our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told us that Allah rejoices over the repentance of His slave and that the one who repents from sin is like one who did not sin. 
Hence we can see that it is wrong to say that the one who commits zina will be punished in this world and in the Hereafter even if he repents. The evidence quoted above proves that this idea is false. Rather Allah encourages His slaves to repent and rewards them for it if they do it; He does not punish them. 
So there is no need to fear having children and no need to be anxious. 
Ask Allah for righteous children, and seek the help of your Lord, and do many good deeds. We ask Allah to help you to do that which pleases Him.

      to write “salla Allaahu ‘alayhi wa salaam (May Allaah send 
      blessings and peace upon him)” in full, and not to write it in abbreviated 
      form, such as writing (S) or (SAWS) etc. 

    Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    said: 
As it is prescribed to 
    send blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    in prayer when saying the tashahhud, and it is prescribed when giving 
    khutbahs, saying du’aa’ and praying for forgiveness, and after the adhaan, 
    and when entering and exiting the mosque, and when mentioning him in other 
    circumstances, so it is more important to do so when writing his name in a 
    book, letter, article and so on. So it is prescribed to write the blessing 
    in full so as to fulfil the command that Allaah has given to us, and so that 
    the reader will remember to say the blessing when he reads it. So we should 
    not write the blessing on the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) in short form such as writing (S) or (SAWS) etc, or other forms that 
    some writers use, because that is going against the command of Allaah in His

“Send your Salaah on

    with the Islamic way of greeting (salutation, i.e. As‑Salaamu ‘Alaykum)”

    [al-Ahzaab 33:56]
And that (writing it in abbreviated form) does not serve 
    that purpose and is devoid of the virtue of writing “salla Allaahu

But my question is that I used to fast Ramadaan, but I did not make up the fasts I owed for nine years. There are about 50 days and I cannot fast all of them. I can do half of them and I will give money for the rest of them. Is that permissible? How much should I give?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
for having guided you and enabled you to do that which He loves. We give glad tidings to you of the forgiveness of Allaah, for the one who repents from sin is like one who has not sinned at all. And whoever turns to Allaah, Allaah will turn to Him. 
Secondly: 
Those who break the fast in Ramadaan for a legitimate shar’i excuse, such as travellers, those who are sick and menstruating women have to make up the days when they did not fast, if they are able to fast. It is not permissible to feed poor people instead when one is able to fast, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number [of days which one did not observe Sawm (fasts) must be made up] from other days” [al-Baqarah 2:185]
i.e., he must fast the number of days that he missed. 
It was narrated that Mu’aadhah said: I asked ‘Aa’ishah: “Why does the menstruating woman have to make up the fasts and not the prayers?” She said: “That used to happen to us, and we were commanded to make up the fasts but we were not commanded to make up the prayers.” Narrated by Muslim, 335. 
Thirdly: 
It is not obligatory for you to fast them one after the other; you can fast them separately, so fast one day and not the next, or fast a number of consecutive days then do not fast for a number of days, and so on… according what is easiest for you, until Allaah enables you to make up all the days you owe. 
You should start by making up the days missed in Ramadaan of last year, so that the next Ramadan will not start before you have fasted them. 
See question no. 26865, for it is important. 
Seek the help of Allaah and ask Him to help you to obey Him. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to say in his du’aa’: “O Allaah, help me to remember You, be thankful to You and worship You well.”

47996,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47996,Ruling on religious songs; and is it a sin to listen to songs in stores and on public transport?,"What is the ruling on singing? What is the ruling on listening to songs? If it is haraam, what is the ruling on religious songs? What is the ruling on listening to songs unintentionally (such as on the bus or in stores)?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
      If singing is accompanied by musical instruments then it is 
      haraam to do it or to listen to it, whether it is done by a man or a 
      woman. The only exception that is made is singing that is accompanied by 
      the daff, done by women at weddings or on Eid, and when one who has been 
      absent returns. We have already discussed this in detail in the answer to 
      question no. 5000 and
      20406. 

    With regard to religious songs, if they are accompanied by 
    music (with instruments) or if they are sung by a woman to men, then they 
    are haraam, and calling them religious songs in this case is calling 
    something by a name other than its real name in order to confuse and deceive 
    people so that they will accept it. How can they be religious songs when 
    Allaah and His Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    have forbidden them? 

    If they are free of musical accompaniment, and are done by a 
    man and contain good and beneficial meanings, then they are permissible, but 
    one should not listen to them too much. 

    The Standing Committee issued a detailed fatwa on the topic 
    of Islamic nasheeds, which says the following: 

    You are correct in saying that songs in the current form are 
    haraam because they include bad words and things in which there is no good; 
    indeed they comprise idle speech, provocation of desires, indecent meanings 
    and tempting voices. May Allaah help us and you to do all that is good. 

    It is permissible for you to replace these songs with Islamic 
    nasheeds which contain words of wisdom and exhortation and lessons, which 
    promote keenness to follow Islam and invoke Islamic feelings, which put one 
    off evil and the things that promote it, and which motivate the one who 
    “sings” them and the one who hears them to obey Allaah and discourage them 
    to disobey Him or transgress His limits; they make one keen to protect His 
    sharee’ah and strive in jihad for His sake. But you should not take that as 
    a habit which one persists in, rather that should be something that is done 
    only sometimes, on special occasions such as weddings or when travelling for 
    jihad and so on, and when one feels low, in order to revive the spirit and 
    motivate oneself to do good, or when one feels inclined towards evil, so 
    listening to such nasheeds may ward that off. 
What is better than that 
    is to take a portion of Qur’aan to recite, and a wird of saheeh dhikrs, for 
    that is more purifying for the soul and is better for bringing peace of 
    mind. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Allaah has sent down the Best Statement, a Book (this 
    Qur’aan), its parts resembling each other (in goodness and truth) (and) 
    oft‑repeated. The skins of those who fear their Lord shiver from it (when 
    they recite it or hear it). Then their skin and their heart soften to the 
    remembrance of Allaah. That is the Guidance of Allaah. He guides therewith 
    whom He wills; and whomever Allaah sends astray, for him there is no guide”

    [al-Zumar 39:23]

    “Those who believed (in the Oneness of Allaah — Islamic 
    Monotheism), and whose hearts find rest in the remembrance of Allaah verily, 
    in the remembrance of Allaah do hearts find rest.

    29. Those who believed (in the Oneness of Allaah — Islamic 
    Monotheism), and work righteousness, Tooba (all kinds of happiness or name 
    of a tree in Paradise) is for them and a beautiful place of (final) return”

    [al-Ra’d 13:28, 29]
It was the habit of the 
    Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) to focus on the Qur'aan, 
    memorizing it, studying it and acting upon it. However they also had 
    nasheeds and chants that they would “sing”, such as when they were digging 
    the Ditch (al-khandaq) and when building mosques, when travelling for jihad 
    and on other such occasions, without making that their symbol or paying too 
    much attention to it. Rather it was something in which they would 
    occasionally find relaxation and stir up positive feelings. With regard to 
    the drum (tabl) and other kinds of musical instruments, it is not 
    permissible to use them with these nasheeds, because the Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his companions (may Allaah be 
    pleased with them) did not do that. And Allaah is the Guide to the Straight 
    Path; may Allaah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his 
    family and companions. 

    Fataawa Islamiyyah, 4/532. 
With regard to hearing 
    songs and music without intending to and without listening attentively to 
    them, such as when a person hears them in a store and so on, there is no sin 
    on him. What is forbidden is listening, not just hearing. But he must also 
    try to advise others against doing evil actions. 

    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: As for 
    simply hearing without intending to or listening attentively to them, such 
    as when a person who is walking down the street hears the sound of songs 
    coming from shops or passing cars, or when he is in his own house and hears 
    songs coming from his neighbours’ houses without wanting to hear it, in such 
    cases he has no control over the situation and there is no sin on him. But 
    he should advise others and speak out against this evil with wisdom and 
    beautiful preaching, and he should strive to avoid it as much as possible. 
    And Allaah does not burden any person beyond his scope.
