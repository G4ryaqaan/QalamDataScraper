In Arabic, the word ""Quran"" comes from the word meaning al-qar, which means ""gathering"" and ""putting things together."" It is so called because it is a collection of all the siwar (plural of surah). It was also suggested that it is so called because it combines the fruits of the previously-revealed books, or because it combines all kinds of knowledge.
(See al-Itqaan by al-Suyooti, 1/162-163).

Types of faults that necessitate plastic surgery


Plastic surgery: Difference between what is permitted and what is forbidden 


Haram cosmetic surgical procedures","Praise be to Allah.Ruling on performing plastic surgery
Your question revolves around the ruling on performing plastic surgery, on which we will give you a brief summary.
Doctors who specialize in plastic or cosmetic surgery define it as surgery performed to improve the appearance of part of the body. This may be done by choice, or because it is necessary.
Plastic surgery that is considered necessary is that which is done when there is a need for it, when something does not look right, when something is missing, if there is too much or too little of something, or because something has been destroyed or deformed . At the same time, it is regarded as cosmetic surgery because it results in improved appearance.
Types of faults that necessitate plastic surgery
Faults may be of two types: physical or congenital faults and faults which result from illness. Congenital faults include abnormally turned-out lips , hare-lips, twisted fingers or toes, etc. Faults which result from illness include the scars left by leprosy or other skin diseases, or scars caused by accidents and burns. 
There is no doubt that such faults and scars cause physical and psychological pain and harm, therefore Islam allows people afflicted with them to remove or reduce them by surgical means. They cause the kind of mental and psychological pain that allows this surgery as an urgent need, where necessity permits something that is ordinarily forbidden. 
Any cosmetic surgery which comes under this heading of need because of the fact that the reason for the surgery is causing harm is permissible, and is not considered to be changing the creation of Allah.
Plastic surgery: Difference between what is permitted and what is forbidden 
To further understand the difference between what is permitted and what is forbidden, we will quote the words of al-Imam al-Nawawi in his commentary on the hadith: 
“Allah has cursed the women who make tattoos and the women who have this done, the women who pluck facial(eyebrow) hair and the women who have this done, and women who widen the gap between their own or others teeth for the sake of beauty, changing what Allah has created.” (Sahih Muslim, 3966)
Al-Imam al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“The woman who tattoos is one who uses a needle or similar implements to prick the skin of the hand, wrist, lips or other part of a woman's body until she draws blood, then she puts dye into the wound. It is haram to do this or have it done by choice. Similarly, plucking or removing hair from the face is also haram, whether one does it or asks someone else to do it for one, unless a woman has a beard or moustache, in which case it is not haram to remove it. Widening the gap between the teeth is done by filing between the incisors. This is done by old women to give the appearance of youth and make the teeth look beautiful, because this attractive gap between the teeth is characteristic of young girls. When a woman gets old, her teeth get big and look ugly, so she may file them to make them look more attractive and give the impression that she is younger. It is haram to do this or have it done by another, because of this hadith, and because it involves changing what Allah has created, and is a form of deception and falsehood. Widening the gap between the teeth is something that is done to make a person look beautiful, which indicates that what is haram is when this is done in the pursuit of beauty, but if it were done as a form of treatment because of some problem or deformity in the teeth, then there is nothing wrong with it. And Allah knows best.” (al-Nawawi, commentary on Sahih Muslim, 13/107)
We should point out here that cosmetic surgeons do not distinguish between cases of serious need and other cases. Their concern is to earn money and satisfy their customers. Materialists and proponents of freedom think that man is free and can do whatever he wants with his body, but this is wrong; the body belongs to Allah and He can command whatever He wills concerning it. 
Allah has told us about the ways in which Iblis (Shaytan) promised to lead people astray, one of which is (interpretation of the meaning): “and indeed I will order them to change the nature created by Allah.” [al-Nisa 4:119]
Haram cosmetic surgical procedures
There are cosmetic surgical procedures which are haram and are not considered to be excusable; these are seen as tampering with the creation of Allah for the sake of beauty. Examples include: breast enlargement or reduction, and procedures aimed at reversing the signs of ageing, such as face-lifts etc. 
The Islamic view is that these are not permitted, because there is no urgent need or necessity for them; rather, the aim is to change and tamper with the creation of Allah for reasons of human vanity. This is haram and the one who does it is cursed because it involves two things mentioned in the hadith: pursuit of beauty and changing what Allah has created.
Added to this is the fact that these operations are aimed at deceit, and may involve the injection of materials extracted from aborted foetuses. These are very serious crimes. Moreover, many of these operations result in ongoing pain and other side effects, as the specialists themselves say. (See Ahkam al-Jirahah (Rulings on surgery) by Dr. Muhammad Muhammad al-Mukhtar al-Shanqiti).
On the basis of the above, we say to you: if the disfigurement that you are dealing with is incidental and is causing you severe embarrassment as well as putting your husband off, for example, and you are not doing this operation for the purpose of making yourself more beautiful, but only to remove or reduce an accidental disfigurement, then there is nothing wrong with doing it, in sha Allah.

    that he uses mercury, this is deceit and taking peoples money under false pretences,

    illusions and magic, and it is known that they do not possess any kind of money or

names other than of Allah) which are offered here in India, after Fatehakhani done in 
the names of saintly persons like Abdul Qadar Jeelani?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The meaning of the Quranic Verse: ""Forbidden to you (for food) are: ..., and that on which has 
been invoked the name of other than Allah,..."" (Al-Baqarah, or the heifer, V173)

Ibn Kathir (May Allah have mercy on him) said in explanation of the above Verse:
""..that on which has been invoked the name of other than Allah,..."" means slaughtered animals 
on which has been invoked a name other than the name of Allah; such as an idol, an antagonist, 
an arrow of divination and the like for which Arabs of pre-Islamic periods slaughtered animals.
In explanation of Verse 3 of Surat al-Ma’ida, or the table, Ibn Kathir said: ""The Verse: ""..., and 
that on which has been invoked the name of other than Allah,..."" means that eating of animal 
food on which, upon slaughtering a name other than Allah is invoked is forbidden because Allah, 
the Exalted, prescribed that His Great Name be invoked upon slaughtering any of His creatures. It 
is the unanimous opinion that one is forbidden to select to invoke a name of an idol of any 
creature upon slaughtering an animal.
In explanation of the Verse ""... that which is sacrificed on stone (altars)..."", Mujahid and Ibn 
Jurayj said: Those were stones (altars) put around the Ka’bah. Ibn Jurayj said: There were 360 
stones (altars) at which pre-Islamic Arabs used to slaughter animal ... They would grill meat and 
put it on these stones.. Allah forbade such act and disallowed eating of such meat even if the 
name of Allah is invoked on it. Slaughtering of animal at stones (altars) is part of polytheism, 
which is prohibited by Allah and His Messenger. Comparison should be made to the foregoing to 
decide the rule for slaughtering of animals on which is invoked other than the name of Allah.
All slaughtered animals on which a name other than the name of Allah; such is the name of a 
prophet, a holy man, an idol, the devil, or an item of worship such as the cross and the like may 
not be eaten.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

It was narrated that al-Miqdaam ibn Ma’diYakrab said: “I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: ‘The son of Adam does not fill any vessel worse than his stomach. It is sufficient for the son of Adam to eat a few mouthfuls to give him enough strength. If his desire for food overwhelms him, then let him fill one-third with food, one-third with drink and leave one-third for air.” (Narrated by Ibn Maajah, al-At’imah, 3340; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan Ibn Maajah, no. 2704). Hence some of the scholars included this hadeeth under the heading of controlling desires. You should also fast a lot, heeding the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “O young men! Whoever among you can afford to get married, let him do so, and whoever is not able to do that then let him fast, for it will be a shield for him.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, al-Nikaah, 4677).

It is not permitted to accept invitations to birthday celebrations , because this involves supporting and encouraging bid’ah. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Or have they partners with Allah (false gods) who have instituted for them a religion which Allah has not allowed…?” [Al-Shura 42:21]
“Then We have put you (O Muhammad) on a plain way of (Our) commandment. So follow that, and follow not the desires of those who know not. Verily, they can avail you nothing against Allah (if He wants to punish you). Verily, the wrongdoers are protectors to one another, but Allah is the Protector of the pious.” [Al-Jathiyah 45:18-19]
“Follow what has been sent down unto you from your Lord, and follow not any awliya (protectors, helpers, etc.) besides Him. Little do you remember!” [Al-A’raf 7:3]
According to sahih reports, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does something that is not a part of this matter of ours (i.e., Islam) will have it rejected.” (Reported by Muslim); and “The best of speech is the Book of Allah and the best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The most evil of things are those which have been newly invented (in religion), and every innovation is a going astray.” There are many other ahadith that convey the same meaning.
Besides being bid’ah and having no basis in shari’ah, these birthday celebrations also involve imitation of the Jews and Christians in their birthday celebrations. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, warning us against following their ways and traditions: “You would follow the ways of those who came before you step by step, to such an extent that if they were to enter a lizard’s hole, you would enter it too.” They said, “O Messenger of Allah, (do you mean) the Jews and Christians?” He said, “Who else?” (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim).

    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The marriage 
    contracts of the disbelievers are valid and may be accepted if they become 
    Muslim. There is no need to examine the nature of their marriage contract or 
    how it was done, and it is not essential that their contract should have 
    fulfilled the conditions of the Muslim marriage contract, namely the wali 
    (woman’s guardian), witnesses and the format of the proposal and acceptance, 
    and so on. There is no difference of opinion among the Muslims concerning 
    that. Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said: The scholars are unanimously agreed that if a 
    couple become Muslim together at the same time, they remain together on the 
    basis of their (original) marriage contract, so long as there are no ties of 
    blood or via breastfeeding between them. Many people became Muslim at the 
    time of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), 
    and their wives also became Muslim, and their marriage contracts were 
    accepted. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)

as long as she knows who her real father is, and she carried 
her real father's name? Her real father is muslim, but she calls 
him daddy, and for the sake of unity in the home, we want her 
to call her stepfather Abi like the others do.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
Before answering this question, it will be useful to shed more light on the 
issue of adoption and giving a child a name or lineage that is not really his.
In Islam, adoption (i.e., giving your name to a child who is not yours) is 
haraam, and is considered to be a major sin because of the wrongdoing 
and corruption that result from it. Allaah says (interpretation of the 
meaning): ""Call them (adopted sons) by (the names of) their fathers, that 
is more just with Allaah"" [al-Ahzaab 33:5]. 
The Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
him) said: ""Whoever claims knowingly to belong to someone other than his 
father will be denied Paradise."" (Reported by al-Bukhaari and Muslim, Fath, no. 
3982). He also said: ""Whoever claims to belong to someone other than his 
father, will be cursed by Allaah, the angels and all the people, and Allaah 
will not accept any deeds or excuses from him on the Day of 
Resurrection."" (Reported by Muslim, may Allaah have mercy on him, in his Saheeh, no. 
2433).
In his commentary on this hadeeth, al-Nawawi said: ""This is clearly stating 
the emphatic prohibition of claiming to belong to anyone other than one's 
real father because this involves ingratitude and a denial of the rights of 
inheritance, as well as cutting family ties and undutifulness to parents."" 
(al-Nawawi's statement ends). It also involves not carrying out the rules of 
inheritance, and ignoring the prohibited degrees of marriage to women [i.e. a 
man may unknowingly marry someone he is not permitted to, such as a sister, when true 
origins are concealed by not calling a child after his real father - translator's note], etc.
If a man wants to sponsor an orphan, the child must still be named after his 
father, if his name is known; it is not permissible to attribute this child to 
himself by giving him his name. If the child's real origins are not known, 
then he should be given an appropriate name by which he may be known to 
others, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""Call them (adopted 
sons) by (the names of) their fathers, that is more just with Allaah. But if 
you know not their father's (names, call them) your brothers in faith "" 
[al-Ahzaab 33:5]
In answer to your question, which has to do with a girl - for example - 
addressing the one who is sponsoring her and bringing her up as ""Father"" 
or ""Daddy,"" Shaykh 'Abd al-'Azeez ibn Baaz has issued a fatwa (ruling) 
stating that this is allowed, because he is acting in the position of a father to 
her, and we should not be so strict in this matter.
Note:	If a man is sponsoring a very young girl (less than two years old) he 
should try to establish the relationship of mahram by letting her breastfeed 
from his wife, mother or sister, so that she will become his mahram, 
otherwise he has to make sure that she does not uncover (take off her 
hijaab) in front of him when she grows up. The exception to this is a 
step-daughter (his wife's daughter from a previous marriage); she does not 
have to wear hijaab in front of her mother's husband even if no relationship 
is established through breastfeeding (al-radaa').",Islam Q&A

According to the majority of scholars, the feet must be covered. However, some scholars allow uncovering the feet.",,"Praise be to Allah.The free woman who has attained the age of maturity is obliged to cover her entire body during prayer , apart from her face and hands, because all of her body is `Awrah. If she prays and any part of her `Awrah becomes uncovered , such as a shin or foot or all or part of her head, then her prayer is invalid, because the Prophet said:
""Allah will not accept the prayer of a woman who has started to menstruate, except with a Khimar (covering)"" (Reported by Ahmad, Abu Dawud, Ibn Majah and At-Tirmidhi, with an authentic chain of narration)
Abu Dawud reported from Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) that she asked the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) about a woman who prayed wearing a Dir’ (chemise or upper garment) and a Khimar (head cover), but no Izar (lower garment). He said: ""The woman is `Awrah.""
As for the face, the Sunnah is to uncover it during prayer , so long as no Non-Mahram men are present. 
According to the majority of scholars, the feet must be covered ; some scholars allow uncovering the feet but the majority say the opposite. 
Abu Dawud reported from Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) that she was asked about a woman who prayed in a Khimar and Qamis (dress or gown). She said, ""There is nothing wrong with it if the Dir’ (chemise) covers her feet."" In any case, it is better to cover the feet, to be on the safe side.
As far as the hands are concerned, there is more leeway: there is nothing wrong with either covering them or uncovering them, although some scholars think that it is better to cover them.

Anbasah ibn Abi Sufyan quoted Umm Habibah as saying ""Allah’s Messenger (may peace and blessings be upon him) said:
""A house will be built in Heaven for one who prays 12 Rak'at in a day and evening as follows: 4 Rak'at before and 2 after the Zhuhr Prayer, 2 after the Maghrib Prayer, 2 after the ‘Isha Prayer and 2 before the Fajr Prayer.""

The ‘Asr (Late-Afternoon) Prayer has no routine Sunnah (basic recommended voluntary prayer). However, it is mustahab (preferable and recommended) that one prays 4 Rak'at before the ‘Asr Prayer. The 4 Rak'ahs are of less reward and significance in importance of adhering to them compared to the ""sunan al-rawatib"" described above. The 4 Rak'ahs are the ones intended by the Prophet (may peace and blessings be upon him) in saying: ""May Allah have mercy on one who prays 4 rak’at before the ‘Asr Prayer.""

      At-Taqwa (piety, righteousness). So fear Me, O men of understanding!”
      [al-Baqarah 2:197] –

      and in the Hereafter. Those who are not “men of understanding” are
      those who waste their efforts and their minds in things that earn the
      wrath of Allaah.
What
      the questioner has asked about, organizing singing parties and soirees to
      which singers and actors from all over are invited, to which entrance is
      free or there is a charge, and attending or watching these events, or
      taking part in them or supporting them – all of that is haraam and is
      not permitted, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And
      of mankind is he who purchases idle talks (i.e. music, singing) to mislead
      (men) from the path of Allaah without knowledge, and takes it (the path of
      Allaah, or the Verses of the Qur’aan) by way of mockery. For such there
      will be a humiliating torment (in the Hell-fire).” [Luqmaan 31:6]
Ibn Mas’ood
      – may Allaah be pleased with him – used to swear that what this
      referred to was singing, because undoubtedly singing misleads people far
      away from the path of Allaah by wasting their time. It was reported from
      Abu ‘Aamir and Ibn Maalik al-Ash’ari (may Allaah be pleased with them)
      that the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
      him) said: “There will be among my ummah people who will permit illegal
      sexual activity (zinaa), silk, alcohol and musical instruments…”
      (narrated by al-Bukhaari). The meaning of the phrase “[they] will permit
      illegal sexual activity (zinaa), silk, alcohol and musical
      instruments…” is that these things are basically haraam. The word
      translated as “there will be” refers to something which will happen in
      the future. What this means is that there will be people who regard as
      halaal and allow themselves things that are haraam, such as zinaa, silk
      and musical instruments.  
It was
      reported from Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) in a marfoo’ report:
      “In this ummah there will be landslides, stones falling from heaven and
      transformation (of humans into monkeys, etc.). This will happen when
      alcohol is drunk, when people bring in female singers and play musical
      instruments.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi).
No doubt the
      things that bring about these punishments are haraam, and are in fact
      major sins – laa hawla wa laa quwwata
      illa Billaah (there is no strength and no power except with
      Allaah). The earlier scholars, such as Imaam Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy
      on him) stated that musical instruments – such as the ‘ood (lute),
      tanboor (long-necked stringed instrument similar to a mandolin), shabbaab
      (reed flute) and rabaab (stringed instrument resembling a fiddle) – are
      haraam, so the instruments that are known nowadays, which cause far more
      fitnah (temptation) are even more haraam than those which were known to
      the earlier scholars. Therefore: it is haraam to organize singing
      parties such as these. Let those who organize them fear Allaah, and let
      those who are in positions of authority fear Allaah and not take their
      children and families to these places. Let them realize that they are
      sinning by doing so, and tomorrow they will be asked about what they have
      done. Let them know that they can find relaxation in obeying Allaah and
      adhering to His Book and the Sunnah of His Messenger 
 (peace and
      blessings of Allaah be upon him), by fasting, visiting the Haramayn
      (Makkah and Madeenah), and by striving in jihaad for the sake of Allaah,
      spreading the religion of Allaah and calling others to Islam, and other
      kinds of good and righteous deeds. They can also find relaxation in other
      permissible activities, such as learning to swim, shoot and ride horses,
      as well as sailing, going to gardens and parks, etc., so long as they

With regard to the verses in the Qur’aan which contain oaths sworn by “those sent forth” (al-mursalaat), the winds that scatter (al-dhaariyaat), those who pull out (al-naazi’aat), the break of day (al-fajr), the Time (al-‘asr), the forenoon (al-duhaa) and the mansions of the stars (mawaaqi’ al-nujoom – see al-Waaqi’ah 56:75), etc., these are oaths sworn by Allaah, and Allaah has the right to swear oaths by whatever He wills, but the created being can swear only be his Lord, may he be exalted.","From al-Lu’lu’ al-Makeen min Fataawaa ibn Jibreen, p. 32"

My question has two parts: 
First, what is the position of a man accepting Islam with a Christian wife, and practicing Islam independently of her, and 
Second, what of a promise to raise my children in a religion other than Islam.  Obviously, I would seek to expose them to Islam, but I am wondering about things such as supporting her desire to have them attend her church, etc.Thanks very much, (name witheld).",,,"Praise be to Allah.Dear (name witheld),

As-salaamu 'ala man ittaba'a al-huda
(peace be upon those who follow the true guidance).
I was delighted to learn of your serious consideration and possible intention to accept the Islamic religion.  No doubt that step would be the greatest thing in the entire NN years of your life.  This step is the one that will protect you from the everlasting punishment of Hell and open to you the path to Heaven after death and will result in success and happiness in this life and the hereafter.  I advise you to hasten with your decision and do not hesitate and postpone.  You seem to me to be of sound wisdom that will lead you the path of truth by the will of God (Allaah).


As for your first question, it is permissible in the Islamic religion for a Muslim to marry a woman from the People of the Book (Christain or Jew) if she is chaste (i.e. of high moral character) and virtuous, as Allaah has stated in the noble Qur'aan (interpretation of the meaning of verse number 5 in the chapter entitled ""Al-Maa'ida,"" The Table):


""This day are (all) things Good and pure made lawful unto you. The food of the People of the Book is lawful unto you and yours is lawful unto them.  (Lawful unto you in marriage) are (not only) chaste women who are believers, but chaste women among the People of the Book, revealed before your time, when you give them their due dowers, and desire chastity, not lewdness, nor secret intrigues (girlfriends or lovers)...""


Based on this verse, your marriage contract will remain valid if you accept Islaam and become a Muslim, and it will not require renewal.  Your remaining with your current wife is permissible as long as she is virtuous and chaste in marriage.


As for your second question, the child in Islamic law must follow the Muslim among his or her parents, and it is the Muslim parent's right and responsibility to ensure his or her proper upbringing, guidance, and supervision.  Your statement that you would seek to expose your children to Islaam is a wise and judicious foresight.  And we hope that with the passing of time that they will be convinced of this religion and implement it in their lives.


No doubt that you will face some difficulty in convincing your wife to raise your children in the Islamic religion considering the promise you have made to her.  However, the use of wisdom and gentle judgment will aid you, God willing, in overcoming this difficulty.  This is important especially considering that it is expected that you will exert a concentrated effort in inviting your wife to Islam, since if she accepts it, the problem will be solved from its roots.


In any case, and no matter what the results, the first step towards success will be your accepting the religion of Islaam yourself.  We pray to God (Allaah) the Almighty and Magnificent that He eases your affairs and brings you success in finding the path of truth and that he guides your entire famliy to Islam.


I would be more than happy to dicuss any other questions or concerns you may have.

1078,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1078,How Often ِAre Husband and Wife Supposed to Have Intercourse?,"Are a men and women allowed to have sex on their wedding night?
If so, how often are the husband and the wife allowed to have intercourse; once a week and so on?",There is nothing in the Shari`ah to indicate how often the husband and wife make love because this varies according to circumstances and personal preferences.,How often husband and wife make love,"Praise be to Allah.How often husband and wife make love
Yes, the couple can have intercourse on the first night of their marriage if they want to. There is nothing in the Shari`ah to indicate the number of times a couple may or should have intercourse, because this varies according to circumstances and personal preferences. 
As long as people vary in their abilities, it is not possible for the Shari`ah to impose a specific number in such cases. But intercourse is the right of the wife and is a duty on the husband . 
Ibn Qudamah al-Hanbali (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Intercourse is a duty on the man – i.e., the husband should have intercourse with his wife – so long as he has no excuse. This is also the opinion of Malik.” (al-Mughni, 7/30)
Imam al-Bukhari reported from ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘As, who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘O ‘Abd-Allah, have I not heard that you fast all day and stand all night in prayer?’ I said, ‘Yes, O Messenger of Allah.’ He said: ‘Do not do that. Fast and break your fast, stand in prayer and sleep. For your body has rights over you, your eyes have rights over you, and your wife has rights over you.’” In the commentary on this hadith, it says: “The husband should not exhaust himself in worship to the extent that he becomes too weak to fulfil her rights by having intercourse with her and by earning a living.” (Fath al-Bari)
It is also the wife’s right that her husband should spend his nights with her. Ibn Qudamah al-Hanbali said: “If he has a wife, he should spend one night in four with her, so long as he has no excuse.” (Al-Mughni, 7/28; Kashf al-Qina’, 3/144).
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: 
“It is obligatory for the husband to have intercourse with his wife as much as is needed to satisfy her, so long as this does not exhaust him physically or keep him away from earning a living… If they dispute over this matter, the judge should prescribe more in the way of intercourse just as he may prescribe more in the way of spending.” (Al-Ikhtiyarat al-Fiqhiyyah min Fatawa Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, p. 246)
The Shari`ah also requires that a wife be protected from immorality by means of her husband having intercourse with her, as much as is needed to satisfy her and to provide this protection. But there is no way that this can be stated in terms of a specific period of time, such as four months, or more, or less. It should be defined according to the wife’s needs and her husband’s ability to fulfil her rights… All of this applies in normal circumstances, when the husband is present and living with his wife.
If the husband is absent from his wife because he is travelling for a legitimate purpose or other legitimate excuse, in this case the husband should try not to be absent from his wife for too long.
If he is absent because he is doing something for the benefit of the Muslims as a whole, such as participating in jihad for the sake of Allah or patrolling the borders of Islam, he should be permitted to go back to his family once every four months or less, so that he can spend time with them before returning to his duties in jihad or border patrol. This was the policy of ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him), who stipulated that soldiers and members of the border patrol should be absent from their wives for only four months, after which time they should be brought back and others sent to take their place…” (Al-Mufassal fi Ahkam al-Marah by Zaydan, 7/239)

And the moon, We have measured for it mansions (to traverse) till it returns like the old dried curved date stalk (36:39)
I will appreciate your help. May Allah guide, protect and bless you for all the help you have given to so many people across the world by answering our questions and ending our dilemmas.",,,"Praise be to Allah.

First of all, let me congratulate you for reaching a conviction that Islam is true and that it is the only religion which meets the needs of mans soul and fills it with tranquillity and joy. From the way in which you phrased your question, it is clear that what you have read about Islam has had an effect on you, so much so that if you had not stated that you are Hindu, we would have thought you were Muslim.

The most important thing I want to say to you is to advise you to hasten to enter Islam, and do it sooner rather than later. Once a person is convinced of the truth, what reason is there to delay embracing Islam?

There is another point which also needs to made clear. Some of those who want to enter Islam delay doing so until they have learnt some practical aspects of this faith, such as how to pray and so on, because they think that they are not fit to enter the religion until they have learnt some of its teachings. This is not correct; once the truth is clear to a person, it is his duty to follow it and enter Islam straight away. Then he can learn about the Quran and Sunnah and broaden his understanding of Islam. The Muslim is required to take learning and practice step by step, as much as he is able to, because no one knows when he or she will die. If a person meets Allaah (dies) with a religion other than Islaam, he will be one of the doomed. Furthermore, a person will not be rewarded and no hasanaat will be recorded for him until after he has entered Islaam, so he will lose a lot of benefits if he delays his Islaam; time wasted can never be recovered.

Now let us go back to your question, which has to do with the thirty-ninth aayah of Soorah Yaa-Seen.

In this aayah, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""And the moon, We have measured for it mansions (to traverse)"" [Yaa-Seen 36:39], i.e., We have made it progress through stages by which the passing of months can be measured, just as night and day are known from the sun.

Allaah says (interpretation of the meanings):
""They ask you about the new moons. Say: These are signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the pilgrimage . . ."" [al-Baqarah 2:189]
""It is He Who made the sun a shining thing and the moon as a light , and measured out its (their) stages, that you might know the number of their years and the reckoning. . ."" [Yoonus 10:5]

Allaah has given the sun its own light and has given the moon a (reflection) of light, and has made their courses different, so that the sun rises every day and sets at the end of of the day with one unchanging kind of light, but the positions of its rising and setting vary from summer to winter, because of which the days may be long and the nights short, then the days become short and the nights long. The sun is dominant in the day, so it is the heavenly body of the daytime.

As for the moon, Allaah has measured for it mansions or stages, so that on the first night of the month it rises as a faint crescent, giving little light, then its light increases in stages and its position gets higher each night. Every time its position is higher, it has more light, even though it is a reflection of the suns light, until its light becomes complete, on the fourteenth of the month, when it is a full moon. Then it starts to decrease until, at the end of the month, it ""returns like the old dried curved date stalk""

Ibn Abbaas, may Allaah be pleased with him, said: ""This is the stalk of a bunch of dates."" Mujaahid said: ""It is a dried stalk."" Ibn Abbaas meant: the stalk of a bunch of dates when it becomes old, dry and bent. (Reference: Tafsir Ibn Katheer).

This likening of the moon at the end of the month to an old dried curved date stalk is a beautiful example of eloquence, by choosing a simile from the environment of the first listeners.

1087,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1087,Ruling on saying ‘I am a Salafi’,"I have come to know a person who follows the Salafi da’wah and I have read a book about this movement. I believe that the Salafi da’wah is correct and that those who follow it have the sound ‘aqeedah (belief), but there are some matters I want to ask about.
How correct is it from an Islamic point of view to use the word “Salafi” and to describe oneself in this way?
If a person says that he is a Salafi, is he praising himself? Is this considered to be dividing the ummah?
If we tell the Sufis that their madhhab is not correct, and that neither the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or his Companions taught it, they will respond that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or his Companions did not use the word “Salafi” either, so how should we reply to them?","Each person is obliged to follow the guidance of the Prophet Muhammad and his Companions. This is the way of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jama’ah and the followers of the righteous predecessors (al-salaf al-salih). For more about saying ‘I am a Salafi’, see the detailed answer.","Who are Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jama’ah?


Who are the Salaf? 


Can you say ‘I am a Salafi’?


Response to the Sufi claims


Your way to salvation","Praise be to Allah.Who are Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jama’ah?
We can answer this question with the following points:
Each person is obliged to follow the guidance of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his Companions. This is the way of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jama’ah and the followers of the righteous predecessors (al-salaf al-salih). Allah says (interpretation of the meanings):
“Say (O Muhammad): ‘This is my way; I invite unto Allah with sure knowledge, I and whosoever follows me with sure knowledge. And Glorified and Exalted be Allah (above all that they associate as partners with Him). And I am not of the mushrikeen (polytheists… those who worship others along with Allah or set up rivals or partners to Allah).” [Yusuf 12:108]
“And whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger (Muhammad) after the right path has been shown clearly to him, and follows other than the believers’ way, We shall keep him in the oath he has chosen, and burn him in Hell – what an evil destination!” [al-Nisa 4:115]
Who are the Salaf? 
Whoever follows the way of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) belongs to the salaf al-salih , even if the people call him something else; by the same token, whoever goes against it and deviates from the Sunnah is an innovator, even if he claims to be a Salafi.
Can you say ‘I am a Salafi’?
If a person calls himself a Salafi to express his gratitude for having been guided to this way, or to clearly distinguish himself from innovation, then this is OK and is allowed in Islam. But if he says it only for the purpose of praising himself, then this is not allowed, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… therefore justify not yourselves…” [al-Najm 53:32]. 
Similarly, it is not allowed if it is said in a spirit of tribalism or sectarianism, because such attitudes are forbidden, as is clear from the following story: Jabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah said: “A man from the Muhajireen shoved a man from the Ansar from behind, so each man’s people gathered around him, saying ‘O Muhajireen (come and help)!’ or ‘O Ansar (come and help)!’ News of this reached the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and he said, ‘Stop this, for it is repulsive.’ Then he said, ‘What is this call of the people of jahiliyyah? What is this call of the people of jahiliyyah?’” (Reported by Imam Ahmad, 14105; the hadeeth is also to be found in al-Sahihayn).
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) called it the call of the people of jahiliyyah and described it as repulsive, even though the words “Ansari” and “Muhajiri” are Islamic words, the first referring to those who supported Allah and His Messenger, and the second referring to those who left the land of kufr and migrated to Allah and His Messenger. Why were they described in this manner? Because in this instance, the words were not used in a permissible fashion; the usage was a sectarian and political one that could have led to fighting between the two groups. The same applies to the word “Salafi”.
If the Ahl al-Sunnah and the salaf draw a line between themselves and the innovators, this is not considered to be dividing the ummah, as those who criticize the use of this word think is the case, but this distancing of oneself has to be done in accordance with the degree of bid’ah – whether it is major or minor – and should be regulated by the overall interests of the Islamic da’wah.
Response to the Sufi claims
The Sufi claims mentioned in the question are not valid. The denunciation is not merely because of the word “Sufi”, which is a general word that may be applied to things approved of in Islam, such as asceticism (zuhd) and fear of Allah, or it may be applied to innovations such as monasticism and extremism. Rather the denunciation is because of the various types of shirk, major and minor, that are connected with Sufism and its tariqahs . 
The word Tasawwuf (Sufism) now refers to the Sufi tariqahs and the kinds of innovations they have. Sufism – as is obvious from their books and how Sufis actually are – includes deviant ideas of kufr, such as hulool (incarnation or the belief that the Creator may be indwelling in His creation – exalted be Allah above what they say), ittihad (union) and wahdat al-wujood (pantheism or the unity of existence, which is the belief that the Creator and His creation are the same thing, and that everything in existence is Allah – exalted be Allah above what they say), and going to extremes in what they say about the awliya, in addition to their innovations in the matter of acts of worship and awrad (du’as).
Your way to salvation
The one who is seeking salvation has to work hard to gain beneficial knowledge and do righteous deeds, and he should avoid vain arguments and futile discussions in which there is no benefit.

Some of the mufassireen said that these aayat mention only four of the prayers; ‘isha’ is not mentioned here, but it is mentioned in Soorat Hood, where Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… and in some hours of the night…” [Hood 11:114] 
Most of the mufassireen are of the first opinion. Al-Nahhaas (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The scholars of Tafseer say that the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): ‘So glorify Allah when you come up to the evening and when you enter the morning…’ [al-Room 30:17] refers to the prayers.” 
Imaam al-Jassaas (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘… The prayer is enjoined on the believers at fixed times [mawqootan].’ [al-Nisa’ 4:103]. It was reported that ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ood said: ‘[Mawqootan means that] Salaah has an appointed time just as Hajj does.’ It was reported that Ibn ‘Abbaas, Mujaahid and ‘Atiyyah said [that mawqootan means] ‘It is obligatory’… The word ‘mawqootan’ means that it is obligatory at certain times. The times are referred to in general terms in this aayah and are explained elsewhere in the Book, without defining precisely when those times start and end – that was explained in detail by the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).  What Allah mentioned about the times of the prayers in His Book is (interpretation of the meaning): “Perform al-Salaah from mid-day till the darkness of the night and recite the Quran in the early dawn…” [al-Isra’ 17:78]. Mujaahid reported from Ibn ‘Abbaas: “’Mid-day’ means when the sun has passed its zenith for salaat al-zuhr, and ‘the darkness of the night’ means the beginning of the night, for salaat al-maghrib.” It was also reported from Ibn ‘Umar that mid-day meant the zenith…  Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And perform al-salaah at the two ends of the day and in some parts of the night” [Hood 11:114]. ‘Amr reported from al-Hasan that ‘the two ends of the day’ means fajr at the first end and zuhr and ‘asr at the other; ‘some parts of the night’ means maghrib and ‘isha’. So according to this opinion the aayah refers to all five prayers….  Layth reported from al-Hakam from Abu ‘Ayyaad that Ibn ‘Abbaas said: “This aayah mentions all five prayers together. ‘So glorify Allah when you come up to the evening’ refers to maghrib and ‘isha’, ‘and when you enter the morning’ refers to fajr, ‘in the afternoon’ is ‘asr; and ‘the time when the day begins to decline’ is zuhr.” Something similar was also reported from al-Hasan. 
Abu Razeen reported from Ibn ‘Abbaas: “ ‘…and glorify the praises of your Lord before the rising of the sun and before (its) setting’ [Qaaf 50:39 – interpretation of the meaning] refers to the prescribed prayers. ‘… and glorify the praises of your Lord before the rising of the sun, and before its setting, and during some of the hours of the night, and at the sides of the day, that you may become pleased with the reward which Allah shall give you.’ [Ta-Ha 20:130 – interpretation of the meaning] This aayah also includes the times of the prayers. All of these aayaat mention the times of the prayers.” 
Ahkaam al-Quran by al-Jassaas, Baab Mawaaqeet al-Salaah. 
What you should also know is that the Quran does not contain details of all the rules. The Quran mentions many rules, but it also tells us that the Sunnah is a source of evidence in which many rules are mentioned in detail that are not mentioned in the Quran. Allah says (interpretation of the meanings):
“… and We have also sent down to you (O Muhammad) the reminder and the advice (the Quran), that you may explain clearly to men what is sent down to them and that they may give thought.” [al-Nahl 16:44]
“… and whatsoever the Messenger gives you, take it…” [al-Hashr 59:7]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I have been given the Quran and something like it with it…” (Reported by Imaam Ahmad, 16546; this is a saheeh hadeeth).

Once this distinction and contrast is made clear, there can be no brotherhood between a monotheistic believer and a polytheistic disbeliever, as Allaah says in the Quraan (interpretation of the meaning): Indeed there has been an excellent example for you in Ibraaheem and those with him, when they said to their people, Verily, we are free from you and whatever you worship besides Allaah. We have rejected you, and there has started between us and you, hostility and hatred forever, - until you believe in Allaah Alone, except the saying of Ibraaheem to his father: Verily, I will ask for forgiveness (from Allaah) for you, but I have no power to do anything for you before Allaah. Our Lord! In You (Alone) we put our trust, and to You (Alone) we turn in repentance, and to You (Alone) is (our) final Return, - Certainly, there has been in them an excellent example for you to follow, - for those who look forward to (the Meeting with) Allaah (for the reward from Him) and the Last Day. And whosoever turn away, then verily, Allaah is Rich (Free of all wants), Worthy of all Praise. [al-Mumtahinah 60:4,6]


Once this separation and enmity is clear, it is unavoidable that there will be hostility and disavowal and the resulting struggle against the enemies of Allaah. So long as the laws and wisdom of Allaah dictate that there should the distinction between believers and disbelievers, there has to be this clearly-stated enmity. There can be no change to the laws of Allaah.
There cannot be harmony between Jews who are usurpers and aggressors, who have oppressed and persecuted others, and who are known for their treachery and corruption throughout the world, historically and in the present age and the purely monotheistic Muslim owners of the land, whose menfolk the Jews have killed, and imprisoned their sons, and destroyed their homes, and taken possession of their lands by force, and prevented them from earning a proper living, and carried out chemical and radiational experiments on their prisoners, and taken organs from them for transplant into Jewish patients and all other kinds of persecutions and atrocities.
In addition to this, the Jews are people of treachery and betrayal; it is not possible to trust them at all. Their current conduct bears this out: is there any treaty or agreement signed by them that they have actually fulfilled? This is no big surprise for the Muslims, who know what Allaah has said in His Book about the Jews (interpretation of the meaning): Is it not (the case) that every time they make a covenant, some party among them throws it aside? Nay! The truth is most of them believe not. [al-Baqarah 2:100].
Moreover, if the Muslims agreed to live in peace with the Jews, who would be in charge? One of the basic principles of Islam is that Islam should prevail, not be prevailed over. One of the conditions for People of the Book (Jews and Christians) living with Muslims in a Muslim country is that they should live under certain conditions (shuroot ahl al-dhimmah) in return for the security and protection afforded them by the Muslims. One of the most important of these conditions is that they should not openly display their shirk and kufr (polytheistic disbelief) in the Muslim lands, whether by word or deed.
As the Muslims and Jews are enemies residing in opposing religious and doctrinal camps, it is not possible for them to be brought together unless one is made to submit to the other by force. Indeed, the Jews now are not allowing the Muslims to remain in their homes, even if there was no provocative action on the part of the Muslims; they are seizing the Muslims property by force, building their settlements on the Muslims lands and expelling the Muslims by any means. They have expelled millions to the neighbouring countries, which have accommodated them in the so-called Palestinian refugee camps.
Finally, although the Muslims nowadays are in a position of weakness and humiliation because they have turned away from their religion and are unable to fight the Jews, take back their stolen lands and impose the rule of Islamic shareeah in Palestine, this does not mean that this will always be the case until the end of the world. Things have to change, and one of the indications of this is the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who informed us of some things that are to happen in the future. He was supported by Revelation from his Lord; he did not speak of his own whims and desires, but of that which was revealed to him. He said:
You will fight the Jews and will prevail over them, so that a rock will say, O Muslim! There is Jew behind me, kill him!
(Reported by Muslim, 2921; al-Bukhaari, 2926).
According to a report narrated by Muslim from Abu Hurayrah, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The Hour [the Day of Judgement] will not begin until the Muslims fight the Jews and kill them. A Jew will hide behind a rock or a tree, and the rock or tree will say, O Muslim, O slave of Allaah! There is a Jew behind me, come and kill him! except for the gharqad (box thorn), for it is one of the trees of the Jews.
(Reported by Muslim, 2922).
We would like to express our appreciation for your question, your desire to find out the truth, and the polite and eloquent manner in which your inquiry was phrased. We invite you to believe in Allaah as your Lord, in Islam as your religion, and in Muhammad as your Prophet, for this by Allaah will save you and benefit you and protect you in this world, in the grave after death, and in the Hereafter on the Day of Reckoning. May Allaah help us and you to do all that is good.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
