3402,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3402,Having an interest-based credit card in cases of necessity,"In my area one of the requirements for renting a car is to have a credit      card. You don't have to charge anything on the card, you just must present it for safety precautions. When the car is returned you can pay cash and nothing is ever charge to the card. So, I would like to know, is it halal to get a credit card for this purpose.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The basic principle is that interest-based transactions are haraam and
    it is not permissible to engage in them. This includes the conditions mentioned in the
    contracts for credit cards. In some countries they rely a great deal on these credit
    cards, and you can hardly find anyone who does not use them. We put the following question
    to Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-Uthaymeen:
Credit cards include conditions based on riba (interest/usury) 
    if you delay payments, they charge an extra penalty. But in the place where I live in
    America, I cannot rent a car or a shop or use many other services unless I have a credit
    card. If I do not use a credit card, I will suffer unbearable hardship. If I commit myself
    to make the payments within a certain time limit, so that I do not have to pay the
    interest charges, will this allow me to have a credit card and thus relieve some of the
    hardship I am facing?
The shaykh, may Allaah preserve him, answered as follows:
If the hardship he is facing is certain, and the likelihood that he
    will delay payments is remote, then I hope there is nothing wrong with him having the
    credit card.
Question:
Do the conditions relating to interest make a transaction invalid or
    not?
Answer:
If a contract contains an invalid condition, this
    does not invalidate the entire contract, for a number of reasons: (1) necessity, (2)
    because it does not really affect anything. The man thinks that he is going to make the
    payments before interest is due. Because this is more likely than the condition of having
    to pay interest, and because it is necessary  which is the main point  I hope
    that there is nothing wrong with it. We have a definite matter  necessity  and
    a matter which is not necessarily going to happen  which is delay in payment 
    and the matter that is definite takes precedence over something which may not even happen.

3404,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3404,A      woman walked in front of our row when we were praying in jamaa’ah,"A sister walked in front of a row of sisters praying behind the imaam. (There were only a few of us in the row and the sister walked so quickly that we could not stop her before she took her place in line.)I understand that three things invalidate the prayer if they pass between the praying person and the sutra, which are the donkey, black dog, and a woman . How should we start our prayer again and still follow the imaam ?",,,"Praise be to Allah.With regard to the idea that a person’s prayer is invalidated if a woman, donkey or black dog passes in front of him, this is correct.
 It was reported from ‘Abd-Allah ibn al-Saamit that Abu Dharr said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘If any one of you stands up to pray, then he has a sutrah [an item placed in front of a praying person as a “screen”] if he has something the height of the back of a saddle in front of him. If he does not have something the height of the back of a saddle in front of him, then his prayer is invalidated if a donkey or a woman or a black dog passes in front of him.’” I [‘Abd-Allah] asked, “O Abu Dharr, what is the difference between a black dog and a red or yellow dog?” He said, “O son of my brother, I asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) the same question, and he said, ‘The black dog is a shaytaan (devil).’” (Narrated by Muslim, 510).
 The height of the back of a saddle is one cubit or 2/3 of a cubit.
 But this ruling applies only when one of these three pass in front of the imaam or a person who is praying on his own, not when they pass between the rows of a congregation praying behind the imaam during prayer in jamaa’ah, as the sister who asked the question thinks.
 The evidence for that is the report in which ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Abbaas said: “I came along riding on a female donkey one day when I had just reached the age of puberty. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was leading the people in prayer in Mina, without any kind of wall in front of him. I passed in front of part of the row, then I got down and sent the donkey to graze, and joined the row, and no one rebuked me for that.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 472; Muslim, 504)
 Imaam al-Bukhari gave this hadeeth the heading of “Sutrat al-Imaam sutrat man khalfahu (the sutrah of the imaam is the sutrah of those behind him).” This hadeeth clearly proves our point, which is that the person who is praying behind the imaam does not have to have a sutrah, and it does not matter what passes in front of him, especially since Ibn ‘Abbaas passed in front of them with his donkey, which is one of the things which invalidates prayer if it passes in front of the imaam or a person who is praying on his own.
 Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said:
 This hadeeth – i.e., the hadeeth narrated by al-Bukhari (487) and Muslim (505) from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri which says “If any one of you is praying, he should not let anyone pass in front of him. Let him push him away as much as he can, and if he insists then let him fight him, for he is nothing but a shaytaan (devil)” – indicates that it is makrooh to pass in front of a person who is praying if he is praying on his own and without a sutrah. The same ruling applies to the imaam if he is praying without a sutrah. But with regard to the person who is praying behind the imaam, it does not matter what passes in front of him, just as it does not matter what passes in front of the imaam or person praying alone if it passes behind the sutrah. The sutrah of the imaam is also the sutrah of those who are praying behind him.
 We say this concerning the imaam and the person who prays alone, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “If any one of you is praying…” According to the scholars, this means praying on his own, because of the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas. Hence we say that the person who is praying behind the imaam does not have to push away the person who passes in front of him, because Ibn ‘Abbaas said:“I came along riding on a female donkey one day when I had just reached the age of puberty. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was leading the people in prayer in Mina, without any kind of wall in front of him. I passed in front of part of the row, then I got down and sent the donkey to graze, and joined the row, and no one rebuked me for that.”(al-Tamheed, 4/187)
 On this basis, the sister who asked this question, and other people, do not have to push away anyone who passes in front of them if they are praying behind the imaam, and there is no sin on the person who passes in front of the row if this is donefor a reason. Pushing a person away and preventing them from passing in front is to be done by the imaam or the person who is praying alone, if a person wants to pass between him and his sutrah.

3408,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3408,Stories of Women who Became Muslim and Left their Non-Muslim Husbands,"I know that Muslim women are not allowed in Islam to marry non-Muslim men; there is a sister on a converts’ list who recently became Muslim and who was asking what to do regarding her non-Muslim husband who accepted her conversion without any problems and who also lets her educate the children the Islamic way. However, when she asked for an advice, most of us told her that the husband has to take shahada (become Muslim) or she should not remain married to him otherwise. Unfortunately, some other people don't believe so and advised her the opposite way; that she just should remain with the husband and so on,.... I would like you to send me concrete cases at the time of the Prophet where Muslim women (sahabiyyat) would leave their non-Muslim husbands if they decided not to convert. I think those cases would be the only proof to convince the people of that list that Muslim women are not allowed to marry or remain married to non-Muslim men even though they are not against the woman's conversion.",,,"Praise be to Allah.What you have said in your question about it being haraam (unlawful)for a Muslim woman to marry a non-Muslim man is correct, and there is no doubt concerning that.


Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):


And give not (your daughters) in marriage to Al-Mushrikoon (polytheists)till they believe [al-Baqarah 2:221]
Al-Qurtubi said:
And give not (your daughters) in marriage means, do not give Muslim women in marriage to Mushrik (pagan)men. The ummah (Muslim nation)is agreed that a Mushrik should not marry a Muslim woman because this is like putting Islam in an inferior position. (Tafseer al-Qurtubi, 3/72).
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
They are not lawful (wives) for the disbelievers nor are the disbelievers lawful (husbands) for them [al-Mumtahanah 60:10]
Al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:
Chapter: when a mushrik or Christian woman who is married to a dhimmi (non-Muslim living under Muslim rule) or a harbi (non-Muslim belonging to a people who are hostile towards Islam) becomes Muslim. Abd al-Waarith said, narrating from Khaalid from Ikrimah from Ibn Abbaas: if a Christian woman becomes Muslim shortly before her husband, she is forbidden for him Mujaahid said: if he becomes Muslim during the iddah [waiting period following divorce], then he may (re)marry her. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): They are not lawful (wives) for the disbelievers nor are the disbelievers lawful (husbands) for them [al-Mumtahanah 60:10]. Al-Hasan and Qutaadah said concerning two Magians who became Muslim that their marriage was still valid. If one of them had become Muslim and the other had refused, the woman would have been divorced and he would no longer have any rights over her.
(Saheeh al-Bukhaari. See al-Fath, 9/421).


Examples of such women include:


Zaynab, the daughter of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). She was married to Abul-Aas ibn al-Rabee during the Jaahiliyyah (pre-Islamic days of ignorance) but when she became Muslim, their marriage was annulled, and she went and stayed with her father (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). When her husband became Muslim, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sent her back to him.
(Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1143; Abu Dawood, 2240; Ibn Maajah, 2009; classed as saheeh by Imaam Ahmad, 1789. Al-Tirmidhi said, there is nothing wrong with its isnaad).
The correct view is that the husband can go back to her with no need to renew the marriage contract.
If the woman is still in her iddah (waiting period), he has more right (than anyone else) to marry her. If her iddah has ended, she is free to choose whether to go back to him or not.
Al-Tirmidhi said:
On the basis of this hadeeth, the scholars said that if a woman becomes Muslim before her husband, then her husband becomes Muslim whilst she is still in her iddah, then the husband has more right to her whilst she is still in her iddah. This is the view of Maalik ibn Anas, al-Oozaai, al-Shaafai, Ahmad and Ishaaq.
(Sunan al-Tirmidhi, Hadeeth 1142).
Ibn Abd al-Barr said:
There is no dispute among the scholars concerning the fact that if a non-Muslim woman becomes Muslim then her iddah ends, her husband has no rights concerning her if he has not become Muslim during her iddah.
(Al-Tamheed, 12/23).
Ibn al-Qayyim said:
But what the ruling of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) indicates is that the marriage comes to a halt. If he becomes Muslim before the end of her iddah, then she is (still) his wife, but if her iddah ends, then she may marry whomever she wants. If she likes, she can wait for him, and if he becomes Muslim she is his wife and there is no need to renew the marriage contract.
(Zaad al-Maaad, 5/137, 138)
Al-Qurtubi said:
Talhah ibn Ubayd-Allaah was married to Arwaa bint Rabeeah ibn al-Haarith ibn Abd al-Muttalib. They were separated by Islam, then in Islam Khaalid ibn Saeed ibn al-Aas married her. She was one of the [Muslim] wives of the non-Muslims who fled to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) kept her in Madinah and married her to Khaalid.
(Tafseer al-Qurtubi, 18/65, 66)
It was reported that Anas said: Abu Talhah married Umm Sulaym and the mahr (dowry)between them was Islam. Umm Sulaym became Muslim before Abu Talhah. He proposed marriage to her and she said, I have become Muslim. If you become Muslim I will marry you. So he became Muslim and that was the mahr between them.
(Narrated by al-Nasaai, 3340)
The daughter of al-Waleed ibn al-Magheerah, the wife of Safwaan ibn Umayyah, became Muslim before him, and the marriage was annulled. Then he became Muslim later on, and she went back to him. It was narrated by Maalik in al-Muwatta, 1132. Ibn Abd al-Barr said: I do not know of any unbroken saheeh isnaad for this hadeeth, but it is famous and well known to the scholars of seerah, Ibn Shihaab, the leader of the scholars of seerah, and al-Shubi. The fame of this hadeeth is stronger than its isnaad in sha Allaah.
(al-Tamheed, 12/19)
Umm Hakeem bint al-Haarith ibn Hishaam, the wife of Ikrimah ibn Abi Jahl. Her marriage was annulled, then he became Muslim during her iddah, so she went back to her husband.

          question was answered for us by Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Munayyi’, who 
          said:
“One 
          of the basic principles of sharee’ah is the hadeeth of the Messenger 
           (peace and blessings of Allaah

          harm.’ Part of this principle is that the Muslim is not permitted to 
          harm himself, which includes not using contaminated water for doing 
          wudoo’.
So it 
          is forbidden to do wudoo’ using contaminated water, but if a person 
          does do wudoo’ using such water his wudoo’ is still valid, because it

3431,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3431,When does    obedience to a created being become shirk akbar?,"At what point does obedience to the creation in disobedience to Allah, become shirk? For example if my parents tell me to shave my beard, and I listen, am I then committing shirk? When is it considered to be shirk?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Obedience to a created being becomes shirk in situations such as obeying that person in matters where what is forbidden is deemed to be allowed, and vice versa, or when that person issues rules and regulations, or laws, that go against the laws of Allah, and the follower believes that these laws are more complete and better than the laws of Allah, or as good as His laws, or that the laws of Allah are better but it is permissible to follow these man-made laws. The evidence for this is the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): “They (Jews and Christians) took their rabbis and their monks to be their Lords besides Allah (by obeying then in things which they made lawful or unlawful according to their own desires without being ordered by Allah)…” [al-Tawbah 9:31]. ‘Adiyy ibn Haatim said: “O Messenger of Allah, we do not worship them.”
[He was a Christian who became a Muslim - Translator]. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do they not allow you that which Allah has forbidden and forbid what Allah has allowed?” He said, “Yes.” He said, “This is a kind of worship.” The Christians’ obedience of their priests in sin and in accepting what they say about what is lawful or unlawful is a form of worshipping something other than Allah, which is a kind of shirk akbar (major shirk), that contradicts Tawheed (true monotheism).
With regard to your question, if the person who obeys his parents in sin believes that it is in fact a sin, but he does what he does because of his own desires or because he is afraid of his parents’ punishment, but it is not the matter of being forced to do so, then he is a sinner who has gone against the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), There is no obedience to a created being if it involves disobedience of the Creator”
(reported by Ahmad, 1041; a saheeh hadeeth) – but he is not considered to be guilty of shirk akbar. But if the son believes that what his parents say overrules what Allah says about halaal and haraam, then he is guilty of shirk akbar. The Muslim has to strive against himself to bring his desires in line with what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught, and so that he gives precedence to obeying Allah and His Messenger over obeying anyone else, and so that Allah and His Messenger are more beloved to him than anyone else. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “None of you truly believes until I am more beloved to him than his son, his father, and all the people.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 63).

3434,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3434,Fasting During Pregnancy: Obligatory?,Is it better Islamically for a pregnant Muslim woman to fast or not fast in the month of Ramadan?.,"A pregnant Muslim woman is obliged to fast unless she fears for herself or for her baby, in which case it is permissible for her not to fast. For more, please see the detailed answer.","Is a pregnant woman obliged to fast?


Cases of fasting during pregnancy","Praise be to Allah.Is a pregnant woman obliged to fast?
A pregnant Muslim woman is obliged to fast , just like anyone else, unless she fears for herself or for her baby, in which case it is permissible for her not to fast. 
Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said, concerning the verse (interpretation of the meaning):  
“And as for those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g. an old man), they have (a choice either to fast or) to feed a miskeen (poor person) (for every day).” [al-Baqarah 2:184] 
“This was a concession granted to old men and old women who are able to fast but it is difficult, so they are allowed not to fast, and must feed one poor person for each day ; and for those who are sick or pregnant, if they fear for their children, they are allowed not to fast and must feed (one poor person for each day).” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 2317; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Irwa al-Ghalil, 4/25, 18) 
Cases of fasting during pregnancy
It should be noted that it may be permissible, obligatory or haram for a pregnant woman not to fast. 

It is permissible for her not to fast if fasting is too difficult for her, but will not harm her. 
It is obligatory for her (not to fast) if fasting will cause harm to her or her baby. 
It is haraam for her (not to fast) if no hardship results from her fasting. 

Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
In the case of a pregnant woman, one of two scenarios must apply: 

She is strong and active, and fasting does not cause any hardship to her or affect her baby. This woman is obliged to fast, because she has no excuse for not fasting. 
When a woman is not able to fast, because the pregnancy is too difficult for her, or because she is physically weak, or for some other reason. In this case she should break the fast, especially if it will cause harm to her baby – in which case she is obliged not to fast. (Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 1/487)

Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Pregnant and breastfeeding women come under the same ruling as those who are sick. If fasting is too difficult for them, it is prescribed for them to break the fast, and they have to make up missed fasts when they are able to do so, just as in the case of one who is sick. 
Some of the scholars were of the view that it is sufficient for them to feed one poor person for each day missed, but this is a weak view. The correct view is that they have to make up the missed days, as is the case of those who were sick and for travelers, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“but if any of you is ill or on a journey, the same number (should be made up) from other days.” [al-Baqarah 2:184] 
This is also indicated by the hadith of Anas ibn Malik al-Ka’bi, according to which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Allah has exempted the traveler from the obligation of fasting and has reduced the prayer by half for him, and has exempted pregnant and breastfeeding women from the obligation of fasting.” (Narrated by the five) (Tuhfat al-Ikhwan bi Ajwibah Muhimmah Tata’allaq bi Arkan al-Islam, p. 171)

Wall of Dhu’l-Qarnayn: Real or imaginary?


Hadiths about Yajuj and Majuj","Praise be to Allah.Who are Yajuj and Majuj?
There is no doubt that Yajuj and Majuj are two huge nations of the sons of Adam. Anyone who reads the story of Dhu’l-Qarnayn and how he dealt with this nation in Surat al-Kahf will know for sure that they exist and that the barrier which was built is not metaphorical or imaginary, but is a physical barrier built of iron and melted copper. 
The basic principle is that we should take this Quranic text as it is, without resorting to any kind of misinterpretation or trying to twist the intended meaning.
Wall of Dhu’l-Qarnayn: Real or imaginary?
The Quran has told us how the barrier was built and what materials were used, so it is not right to say that it is a metaphorical or imaginary barrier. In Surat al-Kahf, Allah has told us the story of the Muslim king and the great leader Dhu’l-Qarnayn (may Allah have mercy on him):
“Until, when he reached between two mountains, he found, before (near) them, a people who scarcely understood a word.
They said, ‘O Dhu’l-Qarnayn! Verily! Yajuj and Majuj are doing great mischief in the land. Shall we then pay you a tribute in order that you might erect a barrier between us and them?’
He said: ‘That (wealth, authority and power) in which my Lord has established me is better (than your tribute). So help me with strength (of men), I will erect between you and them a barrier.
Give me pieces (blocks) of iron,’ then, when he had filled up the gap between the two mountain-cliffs, he said, ‘Blow,’ till when he had made it (red as) fire, he said, ‘Bring me molten copper to pour over it.’
So they [Yajuj and Majuj ] were made powerless to scale it or dig through it.
(Dhu’l-Qarnayn) said: ‘This is a mercy from my Lord, but when the Promise of my Lord comes, He shall level it down to the ground. And the Promise of my Lord is ever true.’” [al-Kahf 18:93-98]
Hadiths about Yajuj and Majuj 
What indicates that these nations exist at present, and indeed are attempting on a daily basis to get out and attack people, is the hadith reported by Ibn Majah with a sahih isnad from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said that Yajuj and Majuj are digging every day until they can almost see sunlight, then the one who is in charge of them says, “Go back, we will dig again tomorrow.” Then Allah restores (the barrier) and makes it stronger than it was. (This will continue) until the appointed time. When Allah wishes to send them against the people, they will dig until they can almost see sunlight, then the one who is in charge of them will say, “Go back, we will dig again tomorrow, in sha Allah.” This time he will say “in sha Allah”, so when they come back (the next day), they will find it as they left it, so they will dig their way out and emerge to attack the people. They will dry up water (by drinking it, because of their great numbers), and the people will seek to protect themselves from them in their fortresses. They will fire their arrows into the sky, and the arrows will come back down covered in blood (as a test for them), and they will say, “We have defeated the people of the earth and have gained the upper hand over the people of heaven.” Then Allah will send worms on the napes of their necks, which will kill them. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “By the One in Whose hand is my soul, the beasts of the earth will grow fat from their flesh.” (Sahih Ibn Majah, 3298)
Umm Habibah bint Abi Sufyan reported from Zaynab bint Jahsh (may Allah be pleased with them) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) entered upon her in an agitated state and said, “La ilaha ill-Allah, woe to the Arabs from an evil that has approached! Today a hole like this has been opened in the barrier of Yajuj and Majuj ,” and he made a circle with his thumb and forefinger. Zaynab bint Jahsh said: “I said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, will we be destroyed even though there are righteous people among us?’ He said, ‘Yes, if evil becomes overwhelming.’” (Reported by al-Bukhari, 3097).

May Allah accept your effort in helping your Muslim brothers to better understand their religion.","It is not permissible to combine all five prayers at one time even if it is because of travelling. Indeed, it is not permissible to combine three prayers, so it is not correct to combine Maghrib, `Isha and Fajr.
What is permitted is to combine Zuhr and `Asr, and Maghrib and `Isha’, but Fajr cannot be combined with any other prayer.",,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to combine all five prayers at one time, even if it is because of travelling. Indeed, it is not permissible to combine three prayers, so it is not correct to combine Maghrib, `Isha and Fajr, for example. 
What is permitted is to combine Zuhr and `Asr , and Maghrib and `Isha’ , but Fajr cannot be combined with any other prayer. 
The reason for this is that each one of the five prayers has its appointed time which is clearly defined, and which should be adhered to as it says in the Quran:
“… Verily, the prayer is enjoined on the believers at fixed hours.” [Al-Nisa 4:103]
This is also indicated by the hadith in which Jibril (peace be upon him) defined the times of each prayer and explained them to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).
It was not reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) combined all five prayers, only that he combined Zuhr and `Asr , and Maghrib and `Isha . 
Acts of worship are based on reports, and combining prayers is an issue that has to do with acts of worship, so we should adhere to what it says in the texts and not try to take the matter any further. Ibn Daqiq al-‘Eid reported scholarly consensus on this issue, as did Ibn Hubayrah. Ibn Hajar al-Haythami said: “`Asr should not be combined with Maghrib, nor `Isha with Subh (Fajr), `Asr can only be combined with Zuhr, in accordance with what was reported.”
Al-Rafi’i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “It is not permitted to combine Fajr prayer with any other prayer, or to combine `Asr and Maghrib, because no such thing was reported from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).” (Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar agreed with him in Talkhis al-Habir, 4/427)
Al-Nawawi said:
“It is not permitted to combine Fajr with any other prayer or to combine `Asr with Maghrib .”

3440,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3440,The misguided sect    of al-Qur’aaniyyeen,"There is a deviant group of people who claim to follow the Quran only, and not the Sunnah of the Holy Prophet . Please provide us with scholarly proof that they are on the wrong path, so we can give them da'wah, Insha Allah.
Wassalaam",,,"Praise be to Allah.Some people have started to claim that the Sunnah is not a source of legislation. They call themselves al-Quraniyyeen and say that we have the Quran, so we take as halaal whatever it allows and take as haraam whatever it forbids. The Sunnah, according to their claims, is full of fabricated ahaadeeth falsely attributed to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). They are the successors of other people about whom the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told us. Ahmad, Abu Dawood and al-Haakim reported with a saheeh isnaad from al-Miqdaam that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Soon there will be a time when a man will be reclining on his couch, narrating a hadeeth from me, and he will say, Between us and you is the Book of Allah: what it says is halaal, we take as halaal, and what it says is haraam, we take as haraam. But listen! Whatever the Messenger of Allah forbids is like what Allah forbids. (Al-Fath al-Kabeer, 3/438. Al-Tirmidhi reported it with different wording, and said that it is hasan saheeh. Sunan al-Tirmidhi bi Sharh Ibn al-Arabi, al-Saawi edn., 10/132). The name al-Quraniyyeen does not befit these people, because the Quran tells us, in almost one hundred aayahs, to obey the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Obedience to the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is considered in the Quran to be a part of obedience to Allah, may He be glorified. He who obeys the Messenger, has indeed obeyed Allah, but he who turns away, then we have not sent you (O Muhammad) as a watcher over them. [al-Nisa 4:80 interpretation of the meaning]. The Quran, which they claim to follow, denies the faith of the one who refuses to obey the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and does not accept his ruling: But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you (O Muhammad) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission. [al-Nisa 4:65 interpretation of the meaning]
Their suggestion that the Sunnah is contaminated with fabricated ahaadeeth is not valid, because the scholars of this ummah took the utmost care to purify the Sunnah from all alien elements. If they had any doubts about the truthfulness of any narrator, or there was the slightest possibility that he could have forgotten something, this would be sufficient grounds for rejecting a hadeeth. Even the enemies of this ummah have stated that no other nation has paid so much attention to examining its reports and their narrators, especially in the case of reports narrated from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).
For it to be obligatory to follow a hadeeth, it is sufficient for it to be known that it is a saheeh (authentic, sound) hadeeth narrated from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was content to convey his message by sending just one of his Companions, which proves that the hadeeth reported by one trustworthy person must be followed.
Moreover, we would ask these people: where are the aayaat which tell us how to pray, or which tell us that the obligatory prayers are five times daily, or which tell us about the nisaab on various kinds of wealth for the purpose of zakah, or about the details of the rituals of Hajj, and other rulings which we can only know from the Sunnah?

3452,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3452,The virtues of Qiyaam (prayer at night) during Ramadan,What is the virtues of Qiyaam (prayer at night) during Ramadan ?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to encourage us to pray at night in Ramadan, without making it obligatory. Then he said, ‘Whoever prays at night in Ramadan out of faith and the hope of reward, all his previous sins will be forgiven.’ When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) died, this is how things were (i.e., Taraaweeh was not prayed in congregation), and this is how they remained during the khilaafah of Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him), until the beginning of the khilaafah of ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him).”
‘Amr ibn Murrah al-Juhani said: “A man from Qudaa’ah came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, ‘O Messenger of Allah! What do you think if I testify that there is no god except Allah, and that you, Muhammad, are His Messenger, and I pray the five daily prayers, and fast in the month (of Ramadan), and pray at night in Ramadan, and pay zakah?’ The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Whoever dies on that will be among the siddeeqeen (those who tell the truth) and the martyrs.’”
Laylat al-Qadr and its timing
2 – The best of its nights is Laylat al-Qadr, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever prays at night during Laylat al-Qadr and manages to “catch” it out of faith and the hope of reward, all his previous sins will be forgiven.”
3 – According to the most correct opinion, it is the twenty-seventh night of Ramadan. Most of the ahaadeeth state this, such as the hadith of Zurr ibn Hubaysh, who said: “I heard Ubayy ibn Ka’b saying – and it was said to him that ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ood said: ‘Whoever follows the Sunnah will ‘catch’ Laylat al-Qadr!’ – Ubayy (may Allah be pleased with him) said: ‘May Allah have mercy on him, he did not want people to take it for granted and only stay up to pray on one night. By the One besides Whom there is no other god, it is in Ramadan – he was swearing without a doubt – and by Allah, I do know which night it is. It is the night in which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded us to pray (qiyaam). It is the night the morning of which is the twenty seventh, and the sign of it is that the sun rises on that morning white and without rays.’”
In another report, this was attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). (Reported by Muslim and others).
Praying qiyaam in congregation
It is allowed to pray qiyaam in congregation, indeed it is better than praying individually, because this is what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did himself and explained its virtues. Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “We fasted Ramadan with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and he did not lead us in qiyaam at all until there were only seven days left, when he led us in prayer until a third of the night had passed. When there were six days left, he did not lead us in qiyaam. When there were five days left, he led us in prayer until half the night had passed. I said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, I wish that you had continued until the end of the night.’ He said, ‘If a man prays with the imaam until he finishes, it will be counted as if he prayed the whole night.’ When there were four nights left, he did not lead us in qiyaam. When there were three nights left, he brought together his family, his wives and the people, and led us in qiyaam until we were afraid that we would miss al-falaah. I asked, ‘What is al-falaah?’ he said, ‘Suhoor. Then he did not lead us in qiyaam for the rest of the month.’” (Saheeh hadith reported by the authors of Sunan).
The reason why the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not continually lead the people in praying qiyaam in congregation
5 - The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not lead them in qiyaam for the rest of the month because he feared that it would then become obligatory, and they would not be able to do it, as is stated in the hadith of ‘Aa’ishah reported in al-Saheehayn and elsewhere. Following the death of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), that fear was no longer a factor, because Allah had completed the religion. The reason for not praying qiyaam in congregation during Ramadan no longer applied, and the previous ruling, that congregational prayer is something prescribed in Islam, remained in effect. So ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) revived the practice, as is recorded in Saheeh al-Bukhari and elsewhere.
Women can pray qiyaam in congregation
Women can attend the prayers too, as is stated in the hadith of Abu Dharr referred to above. Indeed, it is permissible to appoint an imaam just for them, apart from the imaam of the men. It was proven that when ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) gathered the people to pray qiyaam, he appointed Ubayy ibn Ka’b to lead the men and Sulaymaan ibn Abi Hathmah to lead the women. ‘Arfajah al-Thaqafi said: “ ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him) used to command the people to pray during the night in Ramadan, and he would appoint an imaam for the men and an imaam for the women. I was the imaam for the women.”
I say: this is fine in my view so long as the mosque is big enough so that they will not disturb one another.
Number of rak`ahs of qiyaam
7 – The number of rak`ahs is eleven, and it is preferable in our opinion not to exceed this number, following the practice of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), because he never did more than that in his life. ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) was asked about how he prayed in Ramadan. She said, “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) never prayed more than eleven rak`ahs (of qiyaam), whether during Ramadan or any other time. He would pray four, and don’t ask me how beautiful or how long they were. Then he would pray four, and don’t ask me how beautiful or how long they were. Then he would pray three.” (Reported by al-Bukhari, Muslim and others).
8- A person may do less than that, even if it is only one rak`ah of witr, because of the evidence that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did this and spoke about it.
With regard to him doing it: ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) was asked how many rak`ahs the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to pray in witr? She said, “He used to pray four and three, or six and three, or ten and three. He never used to pray less than seven, or more than thirteen.” (Reported by Abu Dawood, Ahmad and others).
With regard to him speaking about it, he said: “Witr is true, so whoever wishes can pray five, and whoever wishes can pray three, and whoever wishes can pray one.”
Reciting Qur’aan in qiyaam
9 – As regards reciting from the Qur’aan during qiyaam, whether in Ramadan or at other times, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not set a limit or state what was too much or too little. His recitation used to vary, sometimes it would be long, at other times short. Sometimes in every rak`ah he would recite the equivalent of ‘Yaa ayyuha’l-muzammil, which is twenty aayaat; sometimes he would recite the equivalent of fifty aayaat. He used to say, “Whoever prays at night and reads one hundred aayaat will not be recorded as one of the negligent.” According to another hadith: “…and reads two hundred aayaat, will be recorded as one of the devout and sincere believers.”
When he was sick, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) recited the seven long soorahs in his night prayers, i.e., al-Baqarah, Aal ‘Imraan, al-Nisaa’, al-Maa’idah, al-An’aam, al-A’raaf and al-Tawbah.
In the account of Hudhayfah ibn al-Yamaan praying behind the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), in one rak`ah he recited al-Baqarah, al-Nisa’ and Aal ‘Imraan, and he recited them in a slow and measured tone. It is proven with the soundest (most saheeh) of isnaads that when ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) appointed Ubayy ibn Ka’b to lead the people in praying eleven rak`ahs in Ramadan, Ubayy used to recite aayaat by the hundreds, so that the people behind him would be leaning on sticks because the prayers were so long, and they did not finish until just before Fajr.
It is also reported in a saheeh account that ‘Umar called the readers during Ramadan, and told the fastest of them to recite thirty aayaat, the moderate ones to recite twenty-five aayaat, and the slowest ones to recite twenty aayaat.
However, is a person is praying qiyaam by himself, he can make it as long as he wishes; if others agree with the imaam, he may also make it as long as he wishes. The longer it is, the better, but a person should not go to extremes and spend the whole night in qiyaam, except on rare occasions, following the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who said: “The best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad.” If a person is praying as an imaam, he should make it only as long as is easy for the people behind him, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If any of you leads the people in prayer, let him make it short, because among them are the young and the old, the weak, and those who have pressing needs. But if he is praying alone, let him make it as long as he likes.”
The timing of qiyaam
10 – The time for praying qiyaam is from after ‘Isha until Fajr, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has added one more prayer for you, which is witr, so pray it between Salaat al-‘Isha’ and Salaat al-Fajr.”
11 – Praying at the end of the night is better, for those who can manage it, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever is afraid that he will not get up at the end of the night, let him pray witr at the beginning of the night, but whoever feels that he will be able to get up at the end of the night, let him pray witr at the end of the night, for prayer at the end of the night is witnessed [by the angels???], and that is better.”
12 – If it is the matter of choosing between praying in congregation at the beginning of the night and praying alone at the end of the night, it is preferable to pray with the jamaa’ah, because that is counted as if one had prayed the whole night through.
This is what the Sahaabah did at the time of ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him). ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn ‘Abd al-Qaari said: “I went out with ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab to the mosque one night during Ramadan, and saw the people scattered throughout the mosque, some praying individually, and some praying in small groups. He said, ‘By Allah, I think that if I gathered all of them behind one reader it would be better.’ So he resolved to do that, and he gathered them behind Ubayy ibn Ka’b. Then I went with him on another night, and the people were all praying behind their reader, and ‘Umar said, ‘What a good innovation this is. What they sleep and miss – meaning the latter part of the night – is better than what they are doing,’ – the people used to pray qiyaam at the beginning of the night.”
Zayd ibn Wahb said: “‘Abd-Allah used to lead us in prayer in Ramadan, and he used to finish at night.”
13 – The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade praying witr as three rak`ahs, and explained this by saying: “Do not make it resemble Salaat al-Maghrib.” Therefore the person who wants to pray three rak`ahs for witr must find a way to make it different (from Maghrib). There are two ways he can do this: either by giving salaam after the first two rak`ahs, which is the best way; or by not sitting after the first two rak`ahs (i.e., praying three rak`ahs non-stop). And Allah knows best.
Recitation during three rak`ahs of witr
14 – It is Sunnah to recite Sabbih bi ismi Rabbika al-‘A’laa in the first rak`ah, Qul Yaa ayyuha’l-Kaafiroon in the second rak`ah, and Qul Huwa Allahu ahad in the third rak`ah. Sometimes Qul a’oodhu bi Rabbi’l-Falaq and Qul a’oodhu bi Rabbi’l-Naas may be added as well.
It was reported in a saheeh report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) once recited one hundred aayaat of Soorat al-Nisa’ in one rak`ah  of witr.
Du`a al-Qunoot
15 – A person may also humble himself before Allah by reciting the du`a which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught to his grandson al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him), which is:
“Allahumma’hdinee fiman hadayta wa ‘aafinee fiman ‘aafayta wa tawallanee fiman tawallayta wa baarik lee fimaa a’tayta wa qinee sharra maa qadayt, fa innaka taqdee wa laa yuqdaa ‘alayk. Wa innahu laa yadhillu man waalayta wa laa ya’izzu man ‘aadayt. Tabaarakta Rabbanaa wa ta’aalayt. Laa majaa minka illa ilayk (O Allah, guide me along with those whom You have guided, pardon me along with those whom You have pardoned, be an ally to me along with those whom You are an ally to, and bless for me that which You have bestowed. Protect me from the evil You have decreed for verily You decree and none can decree over You. For surety, he whom You show allegiance to is never abased and he whom You take an enemy is never honored and mighty. O our Lord, Blessed and Exalted are You. There is no refuge from You except with You).”
Sometimes one may send blessings on the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and there is nothing wrong with adding other du`as that are known from the Sunnah.
16 – There is nothing wrong with reciting Qunoot after rukoo’, or with adding curses against the kuffaar, sending blessings on the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or praying for the Muslims in the second half of Ramadan, because it is proven that the imaam used to do this at the time of ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him). At the end of the hadith of ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn ‘Ubayd al-Qaari mentioned above, it says: “… They used to curse the kuffaar in the middle, saying, ‘Allahumma qaatil al-kafarata alladheena yasuddoona ‘an sabeelik wa yukadhdhiboona rusulak wa laa yu’minoona bi wa’dik. Wa khaalif bayna kalimatihim wa alqi fi quloobihim al-ru’b wa alqi ‘alayhim rijzaka wa ‘adhaabak ilaah al-haqq (O Allah, destroy the kuffaar who are trying to prevent people from following Your path, who deny Your Messengers and who do not believe in Your promise (the Day of Judgement). Make them disunited, fill their hearts with terror and send Your wrath and punishment against them, O God of Truth).” Then he would send blessings on the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and pray for good for the Muslims as much as he could, and seek forgiveness for the believers.
After he had finished cursing the kuffaar, sending blessings on the Prophet, seeking forgiveness for the believing men and women and asking for his own needs, he would say: “Allahumma iyyaaka na’bud wa laka nusalli wa najud, wa ilayka nas’aa wa nahfud, wa narju rahmataka rabbanaa wa nakhaafu ‘adhaabak al-jadd. Inna ‘adhaabaka liman ‘aadayta mulhaq (O Allah, You do we worship, to You do we pray and prostrate, for Your sake we strive and toil. We place our hope in Your Mercy, O our Lord, and we fear Your mighty punishment, for Your punishment will certainly overtake the one whom You have taken as an enemy.” Then he would say “Allahu akbar” and go down in sujood.
What should be said at the end of witr
17 – It is Sunnah to say at the end of witr (before or after the salaam):
“Allahumma innee a’oodhu bi ridaaka min sakhatika wa bi mu’aafaatika min ‘aqoobatika, wa a’oodhu bika minka. La uhsee thanaa’an ‘alayka, anta kamaa athnayta ‘ala nafsik (O Allah, I seek refuge in Your good pleasure from Your wrath, and in Your protection from Your punishment. I seek refuge with You from You. I cannot praise You enough, and You are as You have praised Yourself.”
18 – When he gave salaam at the end of witr, he said: “Subhaan il-Malik il-Quddoos, subhaan il-Malik il-Quddoos, subhaan il-Malik il-Quddoos (Glory be to the Sovereign, the Most Holy), elongating the syllables, and raising his voice the third time.
Two rak`ahs after witr
19 – A person may pray two rak`ahs after witr if he wishes, because it is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did this. Indeed, he said, “This travelling is exhausting and difficult, so after any one of you prays witr, let him pray two rak`ahs. If he wakes up, this is fine, otherwise these two rak`ahs will be counted for him.
20 – It is Sunnah to recite Idha zulzilat al-ard and Qul yaa ayyuha’l-kaafiroon in these two rak`ahs.",From Qiyaam Ramadaan by al-Albaani

3454,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3454,Arabic numerals vs. European numerals,"There is a theory current among some educated people which says that the Arabic numerals in their current form (?-?-?-?, etc.)
 are actually Indian numerals, and that the European numerals (1-2-3-4, etc.) are the original Arabic numerals. This conclusion leads them a step further, so that they call for the use of the European form of numerals in Arab countries, supporting their demand with the fact that the European numerals are used in calculations and dealings with foreign states and institutions which have come to have a great deal of influence on the economic and social affairs of Arab countries. They also refer to the appearance of calculators and      computers which only use these numerals, and this – they claim – makes the use of European numerals in Arab countries something to be desired, if not unavoidable. What do you think?",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to change the Arabic numerals which are currently
    in use and replace them with the numerals used in the western world, for the following
    reasons:
Firstly: there is no proof of what the advocates of change say about
    the numerals used in the West being Arabic numerals. What is known is something other than
    that, as is proven by reality and the fact that for centuries the current numerals were
    used in different circumstances and different fields, which makes them Arabic. There are
    words in the Arabic language which were not originally Arabic, but they became part of the
    Arabic language through usage, to the extent that some of these words are to be found in
    the Qur’aan; these words are described as Arabized.
Secondly: this idea has bad consequences and harmful effects, because
    it is a step towards the gradual Westernization of Islamic societies.
Thirdly: it paves the way for changing the Arabic script and using
    Latin script instead of Arabic, even in the long run.
Fourthly: it is an aspect of imitating the West and approving of its
    ways.
Fifthly: all the copies of the Qur’aan (masaahif), books of
    Tafseer, Arabic dictionaries and other books use the current Arabic numerals in numbering
    their pages etc., and in referring to other sources. All these books represent a vast
    store of knowledge. If the foreign numerals are used instead, this will make it very
    difficult for the coming generation to access this vast store of knowledge.
Sixthly: It is not necessary to follow certain Arab countries which are
    accustomed to using these European numerals. Many of these countries have also abolished
    something even more important, which is ruling according to the whole sharee’ah of
    Allaah, which is the source of honour, power and happiness in this world and the next, so
    what they (those countries) have done is nothing to go by.","Fataawa Islamiyyah,P 528"

Jibreel used to review the Qur’aan with him at night, and when Jibreel met with him, he was more generous in charity than the blowing wind. He was the most generous of people, and he was at his most generous in Ramadaan. At this time he used to give more in charity and treat people even more kindly; he would read more Qur’aan, pray more, recite more dhikr, and spend time in I’tikaaf (retreat). This is the guidance of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in this aspect of this holy month.
As to whether it is better to read Qur’aan or to pray voluntary prayers, this depends on people’s circumstances, and the true evaluation of this is up to Allaah, because He knows all things.

Tarawih prayer is not obligatory for women, and it is still better for them to perform the Night Prayer at home. Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon Him) said:
""Do not prevent your women from going to the mosque, even though their houses are better for them."" (Reported by Abu Dawud in al-Sunan, Bab ma ja-a fi khuruj al-nisa ila'l-masjid: Bab al-tashdid fi dhalik. See also Sahih al-Jami', no. 7458)
Whenever a woman prays in a place that is more private and more hidden, that is better for her, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon Him) said: ""A woman's prayer in her house is better than her prayer in her courtyard , and her prayer in her bedroom is better than her prayer in her house."" (Reported by Abu Dawud in al-Sunan, Bab ma ja-a fi khuruj al-nisa ila'l-masjid. See also Sahih al-Jami', no. 3833)
Umm Humayd, the wife of Abu Humayd al-Sa'idi reported that she came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon Him) and said: ""O Messenger of Allah, I love to pray with you."" He said: ""I know that you love to pray with me, but praying in your house is better for you than praying in your courtyard, and praying in your courtyard is better for you than praying in the mosque of your people, and praying in the mosque of your people is better for you than praying in my mosque."" So she ordered that a prayer-place be built for her in the furthest and darkest part of her house, and she always prayed there until she died. (Reported by Imam Ahmad; the men of its isnad are trustworthy. )
But the fact that praying at home is preferable does not mean that women are not permitted to go to the mosque, as is clear from the following hadith:
`Abdullah ibn `Umar said: ""I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon Him) say: 'Do not prevent your women from going to the mosque if they ask your permission.'"" Bilal ibn `Abdullah said, ""By Allah, we will prevent them."" (Ibn `Umar) turned to him and told him off in an unprecedented fashion, saying: ""I tell you what the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon Him) said, and you say 'By Allah, we will prevent them'!!"" (Muslim, 667)
Conditions of women going out to the mosques 
But there are conditions attached to the permission for women to go to the mosque , as follows:

She should wear complete hijab.
She should not go out wearing perfume.
She should have the permission of her husband.

Her going out should not involve any other kind of prohibited acts, such as being alone in a car with a non-mahram driver. If a woman does something wrong like that, her husband or guardian has the right to stop her; in fact it is his duty to do so.

I asked our Shaykh, 'Abd al-'Aziz, about Tarawih prayer in particular, and whether it is better for a woman to perform this prayer in the mosque . He replied in the negative and said that the hadiths that state that it is preferable for a woman to pray in her house apply to all prayers, and this includes Tarawih as well as others.

He may like to continue doing what he is used to doing, and it may upset the father if his son tells him “Don’t give zakaat on my behalf.” So the son should give his father the opportunity to give zakaat on his behalf, and he should also give it on his own behalf. Some people consider the father’s continued giving of zakaat on behalf of his children to be a continuation of his connection to his children and a sign that they are still under his authority and care, so the son should let his father do what makes him happy.

Please explain.,,,"Praise be to Allah.If one is reciting Quran in situations other than in prayer, then reading from the Mushaf is better, because it is more accurate and helps one to remember better. But if reciting from memory is easier and helps one to concentrate more and have better presence of mind (khushoo’), then one should recite from memory.
In prayer, however, it is better to recite from memory, because if a person recites from the Mushaf, he will be doing repeated actions such as holding the Mushaf, putting it down, turning its pages and looking at the letters. By doing so he will miss out on putting his right hand over his left hand on his chest when standing during the prayer, or spreading out his arms during rukoo’ and sujood, if he puts the Mushaf under his arm. Hence we think that it is preferable for a person who is praying to recite from memory rather than from the Mushaf.
We see some people when they pray behind the imaam, carrying the Mushaf and following the imaam’s recitation. This is something which should not be done, for the reasons we have referred to above, and because they do not need to do anything except follow the imaam.
However, if the imaam does not have such a good memory, and he says to one of the members of the congregation, “Pray behind me, and follow me (my recitation) in the Mushaf, and if I make a mistake, correct me,” then there is nothing wrong with this.","From the fataawa of Shaykh ibn ‘Uthaymeen, al-Fataawa al-Islamiyyah, 8/4)"

3471,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3471,What should a non-Arab do for the adhkar in    salah?,"I have become Muslim, al-hamdu-Lillaah, but I do not know Arabic. What should I do with regard to the adhkar (phrases praising Allah) in the prayer and reading Quran in Arabic?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The majority of fuqaha’ say that if the non-Arab can speak Arabic, he should not recite Takbeer (saying “Allahu akbar (Allah is Most Great)”) in any other language. The evidence for this is that the texts instruct this particular wording, which is Arabic, and that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not do it any other way.
But if a non-Arab cannot speak Arabic and is unable to pronounce it, then according to the majority of fuqaha’ it is OK for him to say the Takbeer in his own language after it has been translated from Arabic, according to the statements of the Shaafa’is and Hanbalis, no matter what the language is. The Takbeer is remembrance or mentioning of Allah, and Allah can be remembered or mentioned in every language, so a language other than Arabic is an alternative, and the person has to learn how to say it in the other language. There is some controversy as to whether all of the adhkar of the prayer, such as tashahhud, qunoot, du`a, and the tasbeehaat in rukoo’ and sujood may be said in languages other than Arabic.
With regard to reading Quran, the majority say that it is not permissible to read it in any language other than Arabic. The evidence for this is the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):
“Verily, We have sent it down as an Arabic Quran…” [Yoosuf 12:2]
Moreover, the Quran is a miracle in its wording and its meaning; if it is changed, this is no longer the case, and it is no longer Quran but an interpretation (tafseer).
(al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, part 5: A’jami).
Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
“Section: It is not right to read it in any language other than Arabic, or to substitute other words in Arabic, whether the person can read it well in Arabic or not, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “…an Arabic Quran …’ [Yoosuf 12:2] and ‘In the plain Arabic language’ [al-Shu’ara’ 26:195]. The Quran is a miracle in both its wording and its meaning, but if it is changed this is no longer the case, it is not Quran or anything like it. It is only an interpretation (tafseer), and if the interpretation were like the Quran itself, they would not be unable to meet the challenge of producing a soorah like it.
If a person cannot read well in Arabic, he has to learn. If he does not learn when he is able to, his prayers are not valid. If he is not able, or he fears that he does not have time to learn before the time for the next prayer is over, and he knows one aayah of al-Faatihah, he should repeat it seven times… If he can recite more than that, he should repeat it as much as he needs to make his recitation equivalent to the length of Soorat al-Fatihah, or he could make it up by reciting other aayaat. If he knows some aayaat he does not have to repeat, he could recite another aayah instead, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded the one who could not recite Quran well to say ‘Al-Hamdu Lillaah (Praise be to Allah)’ and other phrases, which is part of an aayah, but he did not command him to repeat it. If he cannot do anything, but he knows some of the Quran by heart, he should recite whatever he can, and nothing else will do, because of the report narrated by Abu Dawood from Rifaa’ah ibn Raafi’, who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When you get up to pray, if you know some Quran, recite it, otherwise say al-hamdu Lillaah (praise be to Allah), and La ilaaha ill-Allah (there is no god but Allah), and Allahu akbar (Allah is Most Great).” This is more like Quran, and is more appropriate (than any other words). He should also recite as much as he needs to make it equivalent in length to Soorat al-Faatihah. If he cannot recite anything of the Quran, and cannot learn before it is too late to pray the current prayer, he should say Subhaan Allah wa’l-hamdu Lillaah wa Laa ilaaha ill-Allah wa Allahu akbar wa Laa hawla wa laa quwwata illa Billaah (Glory be to Allah; praise be to Allah; there is no god but Allah; Allah is Most Great; and there is no strength and no power except with Allah). Abu Dawood reported that a man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: “I cannot learn anything of the Quran. Teach me something that will suffice me.” He said, “Say Subhaan Allah wa’l-hamdu Lillaah wa Laa ilaaha ill-Allah wa Allahu akbar wa Laa hawla wa laa quwwata illa Billaah.”

“One: The following five methods are forbidden according to Shari`ah. They are forbidden either in and of themselves, or because of their consequences such as mixing lineages, not knowing who the child’s mother is, or other reasons that are objectionable according to Shari`ah.


When fertilization takes place between sperm taken from the husband and an egg taken from a woman who is not his wife, then the embryo is placed in his wife’s womb.
When fertilization takes place between sperm taken from a man who is not the husband, and an egg taken from the wife, then the embryo is placed in the womb of the wife.
When fertilization is done externally between the sperm and egg of the couple, then the embryo is placed in the womb of a woman who volunteers to carry it (“surrogate motherhood”).
When fertilization is done externally between the sperm of a man who is not the husband and the egg of a woman who is not the wife, then the embryo is placed in the womb of the wife.
When fertilization is done externally between the sperm and egg of the two spouses, then the embryo is placed in the womb of another wife (of the husband).


Two: The sixth and seventh methods are acceptable as a last resort in cases of necessity, when it is certain that all necessary precautions have been taken. These two methods are:


When the sperm is taken from the husband and an egg is taken from the wife, fertilization is done externally, then the embryo is planted in the womb of the wife.
When the sperm of the husband is taken and injected into a suitable place in the cervix or womb of the wife so that fertilization may take place internally.

Other reservations that pose a concern in this matter include: the uncovering of the woman’s `Awrah and most private parts; the possibility of mistakes in the laboratory; the possibility that some weak-minded people in some hospitals may breach their trust and deliberately switch eggs or sperm in order to make the operation a success and earn more material gains.

What du`a to say in ruqyah?


Dua for Ruqyah from the Sunnah","Praise be to Allah.Can you do ruqyah for yourself?
There is nothing wrong with the Muslim reciting ruqyah for himself. That is permissible; indeed it is a good Sunnah, for the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) recited ruqyah for himself, and some of his Companions recited ruqyah for themselves. 
‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was ill, he would recite al-Mu'awwidhat over himself and spit drily. When his pain grew intense, I recited over him and wiped him with his own hand, seeking its barakah (blessing).” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 4728; Muslim, 2192) 
With regard to the hadith narrated by Muslim (220), according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) described the seventy thousand of this ummah who will enter Paradise without being brought to account or punished, and in which it says: “They are those who did not recite ruqyah or ask for ruqyah to be done , and they did not believe in bad omens and they put their trust in their Lord” – the phrase “they did not recite ruqyah” is the words of the narrator, not of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Hence al-Bukhari narrated this hadith (no. 5420) and he did not mention this phrase. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
These people are praised because they did not ask anyone to recite ruqyah for them, and ruqyah is a type of du`a, so they did not ask others to pray for them. The phrase “and they did not recite ruqyah” which is mentioned in the hadith is a mistake (on the part of the narrator), for their ruqyah for themselves and for others is a good deed. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) recited ruqyah for himself and for others; he did not ask anyone to recite ruqyah for him. His reciting ruqyah for himself and others was like his making du`a for himself and others; this is something that is enjoined, for all the Prophets asked of Allah and prayed to Him, as Allah tells us in the stories of Adam, Ibrahim, Musa and others.” (Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 1/182) 
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
This phrase is inserted in the hadith, but it is a mistake on the part of some of the narrators. (Hadi al-Arwah, 1/89)
Ruqyah is one of the greatest remedies that the believer should use regularly.  
What du`a to say in ruqyah?
With regard to the du`a that is prescribed for the Muslim to say if he wants to recite ruqyah for himself or for someone else, there are many such du`as, the greatest of which are al-Fatihah and al-Mu'awwidhat.
A group of the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) set out on a journey and travelled until they came near one of the Arab tribes. They asked them for hospitality but they refused to do so. Then the leader of that tribe was stung, and they tried everything but nothing helped him. Then some of them said, Why don’t you go to those people who are staying (nearby)? Maybe some of them have something. So they went to them and said, O people, our leader has been stung and we have tried everything and nothing helped him. Do any of you have something? One of them said, Yes, by Allah. I will perform ruqyah for him, but by Allah we asked you for hospitality and you did not give us anything, so we will not perform ruqyah for you unless you give us something in return. So they agreed on a flock of sheep, then he started to blow on him and recite Al-hamdu Lillahi Rabb il-‘Alamin. Then he recovered quickly from his complaint and started walking, and there was nothing wrong with him. Then they gave them what they had agreed to, and some of them (the Sahabah) said, Let us share it out. The one who had performed ruqyah said, Do not do anything until we come to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and tell him what happened, and we will wait and see what he tells us to do. So they came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and told him what had happened. He said, “How did you know that it is a ruqyah?” Then he said, “You did the right thing. Share them out, and give me a share.” And the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) smiled. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2276, and by Muslim, 2201).
‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was ill, he would recite al-Mu'awwidhat over himself and spit drily. When his pain grew intense, I recited over him and wiped him with his own hand, seeking its barakah (blessing).” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 4728; Muslim, 2192)
Dua for Ruqyah from the Sunnah
The du`as that have been narrated in the Sunnah include the following:

Muslim (2202) narrated from ‘Uthman ibn Abi’l-As that he complained to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about pain that he had felt in his body from the time he had become Muslim. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him: “Put your hand on the part of your body where you feel pain and say ‘Bismillah (in the name of Allah) three times, then say seven times, ‘A’udhu bi ‘izzat-illah wa qudratihi min sharri ma ajid wa uhadhir  (I seek refuge in the glory and power of Allah from the evil of what I feel and worry about).”

Al-Tirmidhi (2080) added: He said, I did that, and Allah took away what I had been suffering, and I kept on enjoining my family and others to do that.” (Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi, 1696)

Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to seek refuge for al-Hasan and al-Husayn, and he would say: “Your father [ meaning Ibrahim, peace be upon him] used to seek refuge with Allah for Isma’il and Ishaq with these words: Audhu bi kalimat Allah al-tammah min kulli shaytanin wa hammah wa min kulli ‘aynin lammah (I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allah, from every devil and every poisonous reptile, and from every evil eye).’” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3191)

      doctor in the army of the kuffaar who are not in a state of war with the Muslims?",,,"Praise be to Allah.We put this question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih
    al-Uthaymeen, may Allaah preserve him, with whom we had a conversation which is
    summarized below:
Shaykh: Is this so that he may gain experience, or what?
- He is a doctor who is treating their sick, but they are not in
    a state of war.
Shaykh: And they are not at war with the Muslims?
- It is possible that they may be at war with the Muslims in the
    future.
Shaykh: We do not give the future precedence over the present
    (i.e., we do not count on that or take it into consideration).
- This questioner says, 'I work in a place where the soldiers are
    not fighting the Muslims. But it is possible that some of the army may be fighting them in
    other places, and it is possible that we may be involved in such fighting in the future,
    but the military bases where I work now are not involved in fighting against the
    Muslims.
Shaykh: But is this nation (in which this army is) one of those
    who are fighting the Muslims?
- The questioner is working for the American army, he is a Muslim
    working in America.
Shaykh: Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, says
    (interpretation of the meaning): Allaah does not forbid you to deal justly and
    kindly with those who fought not against you on account of religion and did not drive you
    out of your homes. Verily, Allaah loves those who deal with equity. [al-Mumtahinah
    60:8].
- And what if they are not driving us out of our homes, but they
    are helping others to do so, as mentioned in the next aayah?
Shaykh:  It is only as regards those who fought you on
    account of religion, and have driven you out of your homes, and helped to drive you out,
    that Allaah forbids you to befriend them [al-Mumtahinah 60:9 
    interpretation of the meaning].
- So if it is clear to him that these people are helping to drive
    us out of our homes, for example, would working for them for a salary come under the just
    and kind treatment mentioned in the aayah?
Shaykh: No doubt it does come under that heading.
- Even if you are working for money and not as a volunteer?
Shaykh: Yes, but they are benefitting from it.
- So how may we sum up your answer?
Shaykh: This is not permissible unless the nation in whose army
    he is working is not fighting the Muslims.
- And not driving them out of their homes or helping others to do
    so?
Shaykh: Yes.

3491,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/3491,Jalsah al-Istiraahah (Sitting for a brief rest during prayer),What is the ruling on jalsah al-istiraahah?,,,"Praise be to Allah.It is mustahabb to have the habit of sitting for a brief rest during prayer, i.e., after the two prostrations of each rak’ah in which one does not recite the Tashahhud immediately after the prostrations. A hadeeth to this effect was reported in Saheeh al-Bukhaari. It was also reported in Sunan Abi Dawood and Sunan al-Tirmidhi via different isnaads that are also saheeh. This is the correct view according to scholarly consensus in the madhhab of al-Shaafa’i. Jalsah al-istiraahah is not mustahaab after sajdat al-tilaawah (prostration during recitation of Quran) during prayer. (Words of Imam al-Nawawi).
Jalsah al-istiraahah is a brief pause, sitting for a short while after the second prostration and before standing up. It is Sunnah according to al-Shaafa’i, Ishaaq and Ahmad. It was reported that Abu Qulaabah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Maalik ibn al-Huwayrith showed us how the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed, and when he raised his head from the second prostration in the first rak’ah, he sat and then stood up.” (Reported by all five major scholars of hadeeth apart from Muslim). The wording according to al-Bukhaari was: “When he raised his head from the second prostration, he sat and settled on the ground, then he stood up.”
I say: one of the features of the prayer is jalsah al-istiraahah which should be done after every prostration from which one stands up.
It is not Sunnah to do Jalsah al-Istiraahah after Sajdat al-Tilaawah, or when one is praying sitting down, or in the fourth or second rak’ah of Zuhr, for example, if a person wants to recite Tashahhud. If he does not want to recite it, then it is Sunnah to do Jalsah al-istiraahah.
It is a separation between the two rak`ahs, according to the soundest opinion, it is not a part of either the first rak’ah or the second.
The best is not to make it last longer than a few seconds, because according to the Sunnah, the shorter it is the better, like when one keeps quiet in prayer.","Footnote to Fatawa al-Imaam al-Nawawi, p. 47"

Taking graves as mosques or places of worship is one of the customs of
    the Jews with whom Allaah is angry. Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported
    that the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: May
    Allaah destroy the Jews! They have taken their graves as places of worship. (Agreed
    upon). Ibn Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The
    Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed the women who
    visit graves and those who build mosques over them and place lamps on them. Some of
    them claim that this was because at that time they were still close to the time when
    people had worshipped idols, but Ibn Daqeeq al-Eed refuted this argument. This
    indicates that it is haraam to place lamps on graves because this could lead to false
    beliefs.
    In addition to the issue of building mosques over graves, this person's
    actions also involve going against the conditions set by the one who endowed this land.
    Moreover, he is denying the Muslim dead space in which to be buried. Adding any extra
    structure over a grave as the ignorant people among the Muslims do is haraam, as stated by
    the fuqaha and ulama, let alone building mosques over graves. So the
    imaam (Imaam al-Nawawi) ruled that whatever mosques had been built over the graves should

    who was the father of Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq (may Allaah be pleased with him), was so white,

    henna and katam.”
Katam is a plant that is mixed with henna, and it is used to dye the
    hair and preserve the colour, as is stated in al-Qaamoos. When katam is used alone,
    not mixed with anything, it produces a reddish-black colour.
Some people have the habit of dyeing their hair pure black at peace
    time (i.e., when not engaged in jihaad). This is not right according to sharee’ah.
    There have been cases where prospective brides and their families have been deceived and
    cheated when a prospective husband has dyed his hair to give the impression of being young
    and strong when in fact he is old and weak.","Fatawa al-Imaam al-Nawawi, p. 23"
