35533,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/35533,If a person’s parents are pleased with him is that a sign that Allah is pleased with him?,"My father and mother are completely pleased with me, praise be to Allah. Is their pleasure part of the pleasure of Allah or what?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The parents’ rights are great indeed, honouring them goes along with the concept of Tawheed, being grateful to them is part of being grateful to Allah, and treating them well is one of the best of good deeds, and the dearest of good deeds to Allah. 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Worship Allah and join none with Him (in worship); and do good to parents…”
[al-Nisa’ 4:36] 
“Say (O Muhammad): Come, I will recite what your Lord has prohibited you from: Join not anything in worship with Him; be good and dutiful to your parents…”
[al-An’aam 6:151]
“And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. And that you be dutiful to your parents. If one of them or both of them attain old age in your life, say not to them a word of disrespect, nor shout at them but address them in terms of honour.
24. And lower unto them the wing of submission and humility through mercy, and say: ‘My Lord! Bestow on them Your Mercy as they did bring me up when I was young’”
[al-Isra’ 17:23, 24]
“And We have enjoined on man (to be dutiful and good) to his parents. His mother bore him in weakness and hardship upon weakness and hardship, and his weaning is in two years __ give thanks to Me and to your parents. Unto Me is the final destination”
[Luqmaan 31:14]
And there are very many ahaadeeth on this topic, such as that narrated by al-Bukhaari (527) and Muslim (85) from ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ood (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: I asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): Which deed is best? He said: “Prayer offered on time.” I said: Then what? He said: “Honouring one’s parents.” I said: Then what? He said: “Jihad for the sake of Allah.” 
It was also narrated from ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The pleasure of the Lord is in the pleasure of one’s father and the anger of the Lord is in the anger of one’s father.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (1821) and classed as hasan by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah (516). 
“The pleasure of the Lord is in the pleasure of one’s father”. This applies to the mother as well, and more so. Al-Tabaraani narrated it with the wording: “The pleasure of the Lord is in the pleasure of one’s parents and His anger is in their anger.” 
End quote from Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi. 
Al-Manaawi said in Fayd al-Qadeer: 
“The pleasure of the Lord is in the pleasure of one’s father and the anger of the Lord is in the anger of one’s father” because Allah has enjoined that the father be obeyed and honoured, so whoever obeys the command of Allah has honoured Allah and glorified him, thus He will be pleased with him, and whoever goes against His command, He will by angry with him.  
This applies so long as the father is not drifting away from the path of piety, otherwise pleasing the Lord is done by going against the father’s orders. This is a stern warning from which it may be understood that disobeying one's parents is a major sin, which is stated in the texts.  
We hope that what you have said about your parents being pleased with you will be a cause of Allah also being pleased with you.",Islam Q&A
35573,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/35573,Writing down people’s complaints – among whom are wrongdoers – so that they may submit them to the courts,"I am not really a scribe but people come to me so that I can write a draft etc for them when they make complaints and appeals to the courts. Just as one who has a valid claim may come to you, so too those who have false claims may also come, and both of them may tell me to write wrong things in order to win their case in court. As well as being a scribe I use certain techniques to make their claims sound convinving.  Is this work haraam?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    If you are writing down people’s complaints and appeals as 
    they are dictated by the people, and you do not know whether they are true 
    or not, there is no sin on you for what you write down for them. Whatever 
    sins or errors result from that without your knowledge, the sin is on the 
    one who said it. 

    But if you know that what they are asking you to write down 
    for them is a lie or falsehood, then it is not permissible for you to write 
    it for them, because in that case it is helping them with falsehood and sin, 
    and Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Help you one another in Al‑Birr and At‑Taqwa (virtue, 
    righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and 
    transgression”

    [al-Maa'idah 5:2] 

    “And argue not on behalf of those who deceive themselves. 
    Verily, Allaah does not like anyone who is a betrayer, sinner”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:107]
You should advise those 
    who you know are lying and remind them of Allaah and of the warning issued 
    to those who tell lies and make false claims, in the hope that they will 
    accept this advice and give up their claims. 

    And Allaah is the Source of strength. May Allaah send 
    blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and 
    companions.","From Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 23/503"
