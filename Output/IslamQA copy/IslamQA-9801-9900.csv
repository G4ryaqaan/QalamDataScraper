    Yes, she may give her father some of the dowry, if he is in 
    need, and giving it is better. If he is not in need, then it is o.k, if she 
    gives him whatever she wants, because she is free and of sound mind, and she 
    can dispose of it as she wishes.","From the fatwas of Shaykh Muhammad Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, Majallat al-Daw’ah, issue no. 1823, p. 54"
9832,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9832,University student confronted with some kinds of bid’ah,"I currently attend a large University in America(University of Maryland). I have met many muslims with strange views while here. Some believe Allah has no hands, which really mean power, some believe Allah is everywhere, some believe that Abu Baker and Omar are Kafirs(Raafidah's). My question is how do I deal with these people when I have shown them the evidence in Quran and Sunna that goes against these deviant beliefs but they don't listen to me. Should I not pray behind or with these people when I often find myself having no Khooshu and I can't concentrate on Allah because I keep thinking about their deviancy. Do I still continue to Salam them and talk with them about other things instead of Islam? Please respond soon, for I am a student and I am faced with this everyday and I am tensed and don't know what to do.",,,"Praise be to Allah.We advise you to learn Islam and ‘aqeedah (belief, tenets of 
faith) from the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and from the books of the salaf (early 
generations) of this ummah. You should read the books of ‘aqeedah written by the 
earliest generations, such as al-Sunnah by Imaam Ahmad and his son ‘Abd-Allaah; 
al-Sunnah by Abu ‘Aasim; al-Eemaan by Ibn Abi Shaybah, and other books written 
by the scholars who did not join or take sides with any group or sect, but 
rather relied on the clear evidence (daleel) and the Sunnah of the Prophet 
(peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Undoubtedly the beliefs that you 
refer to in your question are bid’ah, for these people deny the attributes of 
Allaah such as His having a hand; they interpret it as meaning strength or 
power, despite that fact that Allaah has affirmed that He has a hand which is as 
He wills. They claim that Allaah is everywhere, denying the aayahs which speak 
of His istiwaa’ (rising above the Throne) and being high and exalted, etc. And 
the Raafidis describe the Sahaabah as being kaafirs. All of these people are 
innovators (followers of bid’ah) and there is no evidence (daleel) for their 
bid’ah. 
We advise you to keep away from people like these if they 
cannot be convinced. You should strive to convince them and to show them books 
of salafi ‘aqeedah and the books which discuss the dubious arguments of those 
innovators, such as the books of ‘Uthmaan ibn Sa’eed al-Daarimi, who wrote two 
books refuting the Jahamiyyah and others. If they are not persuaded, then keep 
away from them and do not pray behind them; stay with people who follow the 
salafi ‘aqeedah.",Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Jibreen
9843,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9843,Is It Permissible to Precede the Imam in the Prayer?,We see some people among us in the mosque moving in the prayer in anticipation of the Imam’s movements and not after the Imam. Sometimes they move before the Imam. What is the ruling on this?,"Anticipating or preceding the Imam in prayer is forbidden, and if it is done deliberately, it invalidates the prayer. Delaying following him, like preceding him, is not allowed.",,"Praise be to Allah.It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The Imam is appointed to be followed . When he says ‘Allahu akbar’, then say ‘Allahu akbar’, do not say it until he has said it. When he bows in Ruku`, then bow in Ruku`, and do not do it until he has done it. When he says ‘Sami`a Allahu liman hamidah,’ then say, ‘Allahumma Rabbana laka al-hamd.’ When he prostrates, then prostrate, and do not do it until he has done it. If he prays standing then pray standing, and if he prays sitting, then pray sitting, all of you.” (This version was narrated by Abu Dawud; similar reports are also narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim).
 What we learn from this Hadith is that it is obligatory to follow the Imam , and that he is the leader in the movements, actions and words of the prayer. It is not permissible to differ from him. The best is for the follower’s movements to come immediately after the Imam’s movements , and not to delay them … This immediate following is indicated (in the original Arabic of the Hadith) by the particle Fa (immediately after), which implies fats sequence.
 We also learn from this Hadith that anticipating or preceding the Imam is forbidden , and if it is done deliberately, it invalidates the prayer. Delaying following him, like preceding him, is not allowed.
 The phrase “the Imam is appointed to be followed” means that the one who is following should not precede the one whom he is following or move at the same time as him; his movements should come straight after the Imam’s movements.

9848,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9848,validity of a marriage,"What is the validity of a marriage in this situation: A man has a sexual relationship with a woman. The relationship results in a pregnancy. When the pregnant is in the third month they get married. The couple repent for the relationship, and continue to live as husband and wife for another 20 years or so as good muslims and they have 5 children in total.
Some scholars referring to Aya 3 of Surat Noor say the marriage is void. Please advice. If it is Void is there a way of making it Halaal I will appreciate it highly if .",,,"Praise be to Allah.Your wife’s brother can assume
      the (wali) position. If there is not a brother then an uncle would do. He
      second eldest son would also do, if he is an adult. In the absence of all
      of these, an Islamic judge or the head of the Islamic center can renew the
      contract. You don’t have to tell anyone about the reason. You can say
      that you just want to renew it because you don’t feel good about the
      first one. Publicity is not needed at all. There was an addition to my
      answer to you, but apparently it was lost for one reason or another. Here
      is the full answer once again:
The marriage
      contract is void because it was made without fulfilling its necessary
      conditions. One of these conditions is the readiness of the womb. This
      means that the woman whom is to get married must have her womb unoccupied.
      For example, a man may not marry a woman who is pregnant. He may not marry
      a woman who was divorced until she is out of her idd’ah (a period where
      a widow or a divorced woman may not marry). Also a man may not marry a
      woman he has been having intercourse with until they both repent and she
      gets her monthly period. This is a sign that her womb is clean. The
      Prophet forbade Muslims to have intercourse with female slaves they bought
      recently until they are certain that their wombs are clear from any
      pregnancy. Waiting for the monthly period does this. In your case, the
      marriage contract must be renewed. This is not a difficult thing to do.
      The first boy is not Islamicly your son, as he was not created in his
      mother’s womb through a valid marriage contract. Some scholars say he is
      not to be called after you as he is born out of adultery. He is to be
      called after his mother’s family. He is not to inherit you and you are
      not to inherit him. As for the remaining children, they are yours and they
      carry your name. Other scholars, such as Ibn Taymiyah and Ibn AlQayyim say
      that if the woman is not married at the time of committing adultery, then
      the adulteress father may give his name to this boy and that he may be
      treated as his son. In your case, this last opinion may be the most
      suitable for you and your family. Yet you must renew your marriage
      contract at any Islamic center, and Allah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
9856,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9856,Prolonging the last sujood is an action that is not prescribed in Islam,A man following the Imam is fond of prolonging his last Sujood that at times the tasleem will be said before he rises from the sujood. His argument is that the prophet said that in the lsat sujood we should perfect prayers.What is the ruling regarding his salaat?,,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for 
          the person who is praying behind the imaam to precede the imaam. It 
          is haraam for him to move before the imaam, or to lag behind him so 
          much that he misses the obligatory part of the prayer that comes next. 
          The Prophet  (peace and blessings 
          of Allaah be upon him) said, “The imaam has been appointed to be followed. 
          So when he says ‘Allaahu akbar,’ then say ‘Allaahu akbar,’ and when 
          he bows in rukoo’, then bow in rukoo’.” The conjunction fa’ (translated 
          here as ‘then’) implies following immediately, as is well known [in 
          Arabic grammar].  
Shaykh ‘Abd al-Kareem 
          al-Khudayr  
The idea of perfecting 
          the prayer does not contradict the idea of following the imaam, so long 
          as the imaam is unhurried in his prayer. There is no evidence for singling 
          out the last sujood and prolonging this sujood but not the others, and 
          it is not permitted to introduce innovations into the religion. And

9894,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9894,Is it Sunnah to sit on the floor to eat?,"i have a confusion regarding sunnah. two knowledgeable men in usa said two different things. i heard that sunnah is an action that if you do it you are rewarded and if you don;t do it , then there is no sin upon you. so about the issue of following the Prophet in details such as sitting on the floor to eat. the question was posed to two different people here, both knowledgeable, one of them said if you are sitting on the floor to eat with the intention of following the rasool then you will be rewarded for it. the other shaykh said no there is no reward for it because it is a worldly matter. What is the correct opinion ? this is important because if there is no reward i'd rather sit on the table and eat or wear non-sunnah clothes if  it is merely a wordly matter.",,,"Praise be to Allah.1.The Muslim 
          is required to follow the example of the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) because he is the best example 
          for this ummah. 
2.The scholars 
          have divided the actions of the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) into a number of categories: 
          
a.Thoughts 
          and ideas that cross the mind, and physical movements such as how one 
          moves one's limbs and body. These are matters in which there is no command 
          to follow him and there is no prohibition against doing so. 
b.Matters 
          which have nothing to do with worship and have to do with human nature, 
          such as how one stands, sits, etc. It is not commanded to follow the 
          Prophet’s example in these matters, but according to the majority of 
          scholars it is permissible to do so. 
c.Matters 
          which may move beyond spontaneous human actions to the field of legislation 
          (being prescribed in Islam) because the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) persisted in doing them 
          in a certain manner. These include matters of eating, drinking, dressing 
          and sleeping, especially those concerning which the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) gave specific guidance. 
          The correct view is that these are included in matters which are prescribed 
          in Islam. This is the view of al-Shaafa'i and was regarded as more correct 
          by al-Shawkaani in his book Irshaad 
          al-Fuhool. This category includes the matters asked about 
          in the question. 
d.Matters 
          which are known to be applicable only to the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), such as continual fasting 
          [i.e., fasting for more than one day without breaking the fast at night] 
          and having more than four wives. These apply only to him and not to 
          anyone else. 
And there are other categories… 
(Irshaad al-Fuhool 
          by al-Shawkaani, p. 160). 
 3.It was 
          narrated that the Prophet  (peace 
          and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to eat (sitting) on the ground. 
          
And it was narrated that he said: “I eat as a slave 
          eats and I sit as a slave sits.” 
(Narrated by Abu Ya’laa, 8/318) 
This hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-‘Allaamah al-Albaani 
          (may Allaah have mercy on him) in al-Silsilat 
          al-Saheehah, 544. 
It was also narrated that Anas ibn Maalik said: “The 
          Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
          Allaah be upon him) never ate at a khiwaan or a sikrujjah, and he never 
          had any soft bread.” I said to Qutaadah: “What did he used to eat from?” 
          He said, “A cloth (spread on the floor).” 
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5099). 
A khiwaan is a kind of tray on which food is placed. 
          
A sikrujjah is a vessel in which appetizers are placed. 
          
In such matters it is not obligatory for the Muslim 
          to follow the example of the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), but he may still do so. 
          If a Muslim eats at a table, there is no sin on him. 
With regard to clothing, we are obliged to 
          dress differently from the people of the Book and all other kaafirs, 
          because the Prophet  (peace and 
          blessings of Allaah be upon him) issued commands to that effect, and 
          warned against dressing like the kuffaar. 
The Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever imitates 
          a people is one of them.” (Narrated by Abu Dawood, 4031) 
This hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in 
          Irwaa’ al-Ghaleel, 8/49. 
          
And he  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to ‘Abd-Allaah ibn 
          ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas: “This is one of the garments of the kuffaar, do not 
          wear it.” 
Narrated by Muslim, 2077. 
‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased 
          with him) told ‘Utbah ibn Farqad: “Beware of the manner of dressing 
          of the people of shirk.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2069). 
Conclusion: 
It is mustahabb (recommended, encouraged) for the Muslim 
          to follow the example of the Messenger  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in the matters mentioned 
          in the question, i.e., eating and drinking (seated) on the ground, but 
          there is no sin in eating at a table. With regard to clothing, the Muslim 
          is commanded to dress in Muslim clothes and to dress differently than 
          the mushrikeen.
