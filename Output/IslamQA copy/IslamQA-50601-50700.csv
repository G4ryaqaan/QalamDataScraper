50629,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50629,He vowed to marry a certain girl then he did not fulfil his vow,"I vowed to Allaah that I would not marry any girl except this girl, and that if I married anyone else I would fast for three months. Then I found that I could not fulfil my vow, and I do not have any work so that I could feed the poor every day. What is the solution? May Allaah reward you with good.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
      Firstly: 

    What the Muslim should do is avoid making vows, because the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us not to do 
    that. 

    Al-Bukhaari (6608) and Muslim (1639) narrated that Ibn ‘Umar 
    (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) told us not to make vows and said: “They do not 
    change anything, rather they are a means of making the miser give 
    something.” 

    See also question no. 32724 and 
    36800. 

    Secondly: 

    The scholars (may Allaah have mercy on them) stated that vows 
    are of several types, such as a vow that is intended as an oath, which is 
    aimed at encouraging an action or avoiding it. 

    The ruling on such vows if they are broken is that the person 
    is given the choice between doing that action he vowed to do or offering 
    kafaarat yameen (expiation for breaking an oath). 

    Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni (13/461): 
If a person makes a vow 
    in the sense of making an oath, to stop himself or someone else doing 
    something, or to make him do something – such as saying, “If I speak to 
    Zayd, then I must go on Hajj, or give my wealth in charity, or fast for a 
    year,” then this is an oath, and the ruling thereon is that he has the 
    choice between fulfilling what he swore to do, in which case he does not 
    have to do anything else, or breaking his oath, in which case he has the 
    choice of doing what he vowed to do or offering kafaarat yameen. This is 
    called the vow of argument and anger, and he does not have to fulfil it… 
    This is the view of ‘Umar, Ibn ‘Abbaas, Ibn ‘Umar, ‘Aa’ishah, Hafsah, and 
    Zaynab bint Abi Salamah. This is also the view of al-Shaafa’i. End quote. 

    It seems that your vow to fast for three months if you did 
    not marry this girl is of this type, because by doing that you intended to 
    encourage yourself to marry her. This is an oath. 

    See also question no. 45889. 

    Kafaarat yameen (expiation for breaking an oath) is mentioned 
    in the verse where Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allaah will not punish 
    you for what is unintentional in your oaths, but He will punish you for your 
    deliberate oaths; for its expiation (a deliberate oath) feed ten Masaakeen 
    (poor persons), on a scale of the average of that with which you feed your 
    own families, or clothe them or manumit a slave. But whosoever cannot afford 
    (that), then he should fast for three days. That is the expiation for the 
    oaths when you have sworn. And protect your oaths (i.e. do not swear much). 
    Thus Allaah makes clear to you His Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, 
    lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) that you may be grateful”
    [al-Maa’idah 5:89] 

    See also question no. 45676. 

    To sum up: if you marry that girl, then you do not have to do 
    anything. If you do not marry her, then you have the choice between 
    fulfilling your vow of fasting for three months, or offering kafaarat 
    yameen.

50632,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50632,He had intercourse with his wife when she was making up a Ramadaan fast. What should they do?,"I had intercourse with my wife when she was making up some days that she had missed from the previous Ramadaan, and she was not able to make up all of the days.

 Please note that she had asked me for permission to fast and I had given her permission.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
      Firstly: 

    It is not permissible for a person who has begun an 
    obligatory fast – such as making up a Ramadaan fast, or offering kafaarat 
    yameen (expiation for breaking an oath) – to break that fast except for a 
    legitimate reason such as sickness or travelling. 

    If he breaks the fast – whether that is for a valid reason or 
    not – that fast still remains an obligation that he owes and he has to fast 
    another day to make up for the day when he spoiled his fast. 

    If he broke his fast with no excuse, then as well as making 
    up the fast he also has to repent to Allaah for doing this haraam action. 

    Your wife does not have to offer any expiation, because the 
    expiation is only required for intercourse during the day in Ramadaan. 

    We have previously discussed this in the answer to question 
    no. 49985. 

    Secondly: 

    You did wrong by spoiling your wife’s fast, because if a wife 
    observes a fast to make up for a missed Ramadaan fast, with her husband’s 
    permission, he does not have the right to spoil her fast. 

    You both have to repent to Allaah, regret what you did and 
    resolve not to do it again. If you forced her then there is no sin on her.

50640,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50640,His brother was rich then he became poor. Can he give him zakaah even though he still has the foundations of his house?,"My brother was a successful businessman, and because he was so well off he started to build a luxury house. After a while his circumstances changed and he became poor. Is it permissible to give him zakaah even though he still owns the foundations of that house which are worth 50,000 dinars? He has nine children and they are in a bad situation.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: The poor and needy to whom it is permissible to give 
    zakaah are those who do not have sufficient to spend on themselves and their 
    families. If your brother has accommodation that is sufficient for him and 
    his children, then he has to sell the foundations of that house, and spend 
    the proceeds on himself and his children. If he cannot sell it, then it is 
    permissible to give him zakaah for his maintenance and accommodation, but he 
    should not be given zakaah to complete the building of this house, because 
    the poor person should only be given zakaah in order to meet his needs, and 
    your brother’s need for accommodation can be met without building this 
    house, such as by renting a house that is suitable for him. 

    Secondly: 

    Giving zakaah to relatives who are entitled to it is better 
    than giving it to people who are not your relatives, because charity given 
    to a relative is both charity and upholding of the ties of kinship. But if 
    these relatives are among those on whom you are obliged to spend, then it is 
    not permissible to give them the zakaah of your wealth, and you are obliged 
    to spend on them. 

    See the answer to question no.
    20278. 

    Shaykh Muhammad al-Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen said: 

    The more closely a person who is entitled to zakaah is 
    related to you, the more he takes priority over others, because your charity 
    given to a relative is both charity and upholding of the ties of kinship. So 
    it is permissible to give your zakaah to someone who is related to you, 
    subject to the condition that you are not obliged to spend on him. If you 
    are obliged to spend on him, then you must spend on him, and it is not 
    permissible for you to give your zakaah to him. 

    If it so happens that you have a brother from whom no one 
    will inherit except you, and you are rich and are able to spend on him, and 
    he is poor, then it is not permissible for you to give him your zakaah, 
    because what is obligatory for you is to spend on him from your wealth. But 
    if this brother is poor and has children, then it is permissible for you to 
    give him your zakaah, because due to his having children it is not 
    obligatory for you to spend on him, because you are not his heir. 

    Jumu’ah khutbah (al-Majmoo’ah al-Saabi’ah).

    Shaykh Muhammad al-Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have 
    mercy on him) was asked: 

    What is the ruling on giving zakaah to relatives? 

    He replied: 
The basic principle with 
    regard to that is that it is not permissible for a person to give zakaah to 
    any relative on whom he is obliged to spend if that will be a means of not 
    spending on him. But if he is not obliged to spend on this relative – such 
    as a brother, if the brother has sons and he is not obliged to spend on his 
    brother because he is not his heir as the brother has sons – then in this 
    case it is permissible to give zakaah to the brother, if he is entitled to 
    zakaah. Similarly, if a person has relatives who did not need zakaah for 
    their maintenance, but they have debts, it is permissible to pay off their 
    debts, even if that relative is a father, son, daughter or mother, so long 
    as the debt that they owe is not due to his negligence in spending on their 
    maintenance.

Hence she will not be able to fast these days. What should she do about these days? What should she do if she cannot make up the days of the next Ramadaan before the following Ramadaan comes?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Allaah has given the one who missed some fasts because of a legitimate excuse until the following Ramadaan to make up those fasts, but the Muslim should not use this as an excuse to delay making them up, because he may be faced with some need or changes that make it too hard for him to make them up or prevent him from doing so, especially women who may become pregnant, or be faced with menstruation and nifaas (postpartum bleeding). 
Whoever delays making up the fast with no legitimate excuse until there is very little time left, then Sha’ban ends and he has not made up the fasts he owes, is sinning, but if he has an excuse then there is no sin on him. In either case he has to make up those fasts after the second Ramadaan. Some scholars stated that he also has to feed one poor person for each day. If he is able to do that then that is on the safe side, otherwise making up the missed fasts is sufficient.

Shaykh Muhammad Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the ruling on one who delays making up missed fasts until the next Ramadaan comes? 
He replied: 
Delaying making up missed Ramadaan fasts until the next Ramadaan comes is not permissible according to the most well known scholarly opinion, because ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: “I would owe Ramadaan fasts and I would not be able to make them up except in Sha’baan.” This indicates that there is no concession after the second Ramadaan. If a person does that with no excuse, then he is sinning, and he must hasten to make up those fasts after the second Ramadaan. The scholars differed as to whether he must also feed the poor or not. The correct view is that he does not have to feed the poor as well, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“but if any of you is ill or on a journey, the same number (should be made up) from other days”
[al-Baqarah 2:184]
Thus Allaah did not enjoin anything on people in this situation apart from making up the missed fasts.

The Shaykh was also asked: 
A woman did not fast some days of Ramadaan last year, then she made them up at the end of Sha’baan. Then her period came and lasted until Ramadaan began this year, and she still had one day to make up. What should she do? 
He replied: 
She has to make up that day that she was not able to make up before Ramadaan began this year. When this Ramadaan ends, she has to make up what she missed from the Ramadaan of the previous year. 
Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 19, question no. 358. 
And he was asked: 
A woman did not fast during Ramadaan because of nifaas (postpartum bleeding), and she was not able to make up the fasts before the next Ramadaan came because of breastfeeding. What should she do? 
He replied: 
This woman should fast and make up the days that she missed, even if that comes after the second Ramadaan, because she was unable to make up the fasts between the first and second Ramadaans for legitimate reasons. But if it is not difficult for her to make up the fasts during the winter, even if she does it day after day, then she has to do that, even if she is breastfeeding. She should strive to do whatever she can to make up the missed Ramadaan fasts before the next Ramadaan comes. If she cannot manage to do that then there is no sin on her if she delays it until the next Ramadaan. 
Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 19/ question no. 360. 
To sum up:  These days remain a debt which your wife owes, and which she must make up whenever she can.

50658,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50658,He is confused about how to make up two rak’ahs when he has missed both tashahhuds,"I am one of those whom Allaah has blessed with guidance during this blessed month. I have given up a number of bad habits and I have started to adhere to my religion, but I am faced with some matters of which I am still ignorant, but they are essential parts of religion. My question has to do with prayer. All I know is that a worshipper has to make up whatever he has missed of rak’ahs after the imam says the tasleem, but I noticed that some worshippers who missed the same number of rak’ahs make them up in different ways, such as praying the two rak’ahs with two tashahhuds, whilst I make them up with one tashahhud, based on what I know. I hope that you can explain.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
      Firstly: 

    We praise Allaah for having guided you and helped you to do 
    that which is good for you in this world and in the Hereafter. We ask Allaah 
    to reward you and make you steadfast. The blessing of guidance is the 
    greatest of blessings, for which you must be grateful. Part of being 
    grateful is to continue to follow that guidance and do good, and to continue 
    to keep away from everything that is bad and evil. 

    Remember that knowledge is light. You can look on this site 
    of our for some answers that have to do with knowledge, to read some advice 
    and suggestions of books from which you can benefit.  

    Secondly: 

    What you have seen some of your fellow worshippers doing, 
    making up two missed rak’ahs with two tashahhuds is not something strange in 
    some cases. The reason for that is that when the imam says the salaam, the 
    latecomer (the person who has missed part of the prayer with the imam) 
    should stand up and complete his prayer. So what he prayed with the imam is 
    the first part of his prayer, on the basis of which he should complete the 
    rest of his prayer, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) said: “When you come to the prayer, you should be dignified 
    (and not rush). Whatever you catch up with, pray, and whatever you miss, 
    complete it.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 635; Muslim, 603. 

    For example: 

    If a man misses the first rak’ah of Maghrib with the imam, 
    and joins him in the second rak’ah, the second rak’ah for the imam is the 
    first rak’ah for this latecomer. When the imam has completed the prayer, 
    this latecomer should stand up and do the remaining rak’ah of his prayer 
    with al-Faatihah only, and sit to recite the Tashahhud and say the salaam. 

    If a person joins the imam in the third rak’ah of Maghrib, it 
    is the first rak’ah for him, so when the imam says the salaam, he should 
    stand up and do what is left of his prayer, so he should do one rak’ah with 
    al-Faatihah and another soorah, which will be the second rak’ah of his 
    prayer, after which he should sit to recite the first tashahhud, then stand 
    up to do the third rak’ah with al-Faatihah only, then sit to recite the last 
    tashahhud and the salaam… and so on.

See the answers to questions no. 5326, 30893 and 22782. 
Fasting has not been prescribed for the purpose of being hungry and thirsty, rather Allaah has told us of the great wisdom behind the prescription of fasting, which is so that a person may attain piety and fear of Allaah thereby. 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Observing As-Sawm (the fasting) is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, that you may become Al-Muttaqoon (the pious)”
[al-Baqarah 2:183]
Piety means doing acts of obedience and worship, and abstaining from acts of disobedience and sin. 
Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us that in many cases people fast and get nothing from their fast except hunger and thirst. 
It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There may be people who fast and get nothing from their fast except hunger, and there may be those who pray qiyaam and get nothing from their qiyaam but a sleepless night.” 
Narrated by Ibn Maajah, 1690; classed as saheeh by Ibn Hibbaan, 8/257, and by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Targheeb, 10/83. 
It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “A fasting person’s gain from the fast may be hunger and thirst, and the praying person’s gain from qiyaam may be a sleepless night.” 
Narrated by al-Tabaraani in al-Kabeer, 12/382; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Targheeb wa’l-Tarheeb, 1084. 
Just as the Muslim should make the most of the opportunity whilst one or both of his parents are still alive to enter Paradise because of them, so too he should make the most of the opportunity in Ramadaan to repent, seek forgiveness and fear his Lord so that he might enter Paradise because of that. 
It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) ascended the minbar and said: “Ameen, ameen, ameen.” It was said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah, you ascended the minbar and said, ‘Ameen, ameen, ameen.” He said: “Jibreel (peace be upon him) came to me and said: ‘If Ramadaan comes and a person is not forgiven, he will enter Hell and Allaah will cast him far away. Say Ameen.’ So I said Ameen. He said: ‘O Muhammad, if both or one of a person’s parents are alive and he does not honour them and he dies, he will enter Hell and Allaah will cast him far away. Say Ameen.’ So I said Ameen. He said: ‘If you are mentioned in a person’s presence and he does not send blessings upon you and he dies, he will enter Hell and Allaah will cast him far away. Say Ameen.’ So I said Ameen.” 
Narrated by Ibn Hibbaan, 3/188; classed as saheeh by al-Shaykh al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Targheeb, 1679. 
Conclusion: You must strive to please your parents even if they make you do more than you can bear. If you seek reward from Allaah by doing that, Allaah will – if He wills – open the doors of provision to you. There is no need to be sensitive about your family asking for money for maintenance, because they are not asking for it for haraam or sinful purposes, so there is nothing wrong with that. 
You could speak to them – if they are well off – in a nice manner, and make them understand your need and that you are not able to give more than you are already giving. Similarly you also have to help them and spend on them as much as you can if they are in need. 
The onset of the month of Ramadaan is an opportunity to set things straight between you and them, and it is an opportunity to give and be generous. The kind of giving which brings the greatest reward is spending on one’s family as it says in the hadeeth of Hakeem ibn Hizaam (may Allaah be pleased with him) according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The upper hand is better than the lower hand, and start with those who are under your care, and the best of charity is that given when you can afford it, and start with those for whose maintenance you are responsible.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1428; Muslim, 1034. So spend and seek reward with Allaah, and accept the glad tidings from your Lord.

You should not seek to do an naafil act if that is at the expense of something that is obligatory. You can offer taraaweeh in your place of work two rak’ahs at a time, depending on how much free time you have, or you can offer it at the end of the night in your home.

You are not sinning by missing taraaweeh because taraaweeh is Sunnah; if a person does it he will be rewarded for it but if he does not do it there is no sin on him.   
Allaah knows your intention and that if it were not for the fact that you are occupied with something that you must do, which is earning a living from this job, then you would have prayed taraaweeh. The bounty of Allaah is immense and He will reward you according to your intention.

The plan is to read 12 pages, then to complete 8 pages in Taraaweeh, so that in one night they can complete one juz’ and thus complete the whole Qur’aan by the end of the month.

    study the Qur’aan together, day and night, following the example of the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with whom Jibreel 
    used to study the Qur’aan every year in Ramadaan, and he studied it with him 
    twice in the last year of his life, and with the aim of drawing closer to

    from it and act upon it. This is the way of the righteous salaf and the 
    believers, male and female, should occupy themselves with the Qur’aan, 
    reciting it, pondering its meanings and referring to the books of tafseer in 
    order to benefit from it and learn more. 

    Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 
    11/319, 320. 
It is better when reading 
    Qur’aan to also learn the rulings of the Qur’aan, and understand it 
    meanings. So if you add to reading some tafseer (commentary) on what you 
    read or on part of it, then you will combine many good things, such as 
    following the Sunnah, studying the Qur’aan together, teaching the Muslims 
    and helping them to ponder the Qur’aan. 

    If this completion of the Qur’aan is done in Taraaweeh prayer 
    that is better than it being done outside the prayer.

    encouragement to recite Qur’aan applies more to the one who is praying than 
    to anyone else, for reciting the Qur’aan in prayer is better than reciting 
    it outside of prayer. The reports which speak of the virtue of the one who 
    recites Qur’aan refer to the one who is praying more than anyone else. End 
    quote. 

    If it is difficult for the people to complete the Qur’aan in 
    the prayer, they can combine two good things: studying the Qur’aan before 
    the prayer, and reciting the rest during the prayer, as you are doing. 

    It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with 
    him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) was the most generous of people, and he was at his most generous 
    during Ramadaan when Jibreel would meet with him. He would meet him on every 
    night of Ramadaan and study the Qur’aan with him. And the Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was as generous as 
    the wind in doing good. 

    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3048; Muslim, 2308. 

    Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    was asked: 

    Can it be understood from the fact that Jibreel (peace be 
    upon him) studied Qur’aan with the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) every night in Ramadaan, that it is good to complete the 
    Qur’aan (in this month)? 

    He replied: 

    It may be understood that it is mustahabb to study the 
    Qur’aan and that the believer should study it with those who will benefit 
    him and help him, because the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) studied with Jibreel (peace be upon him) for a reason, because 
    Jibreel was the one who had brought it from Allaah, so he was the emissary 
    between Allaah and the Messengers. 

    Undoubtedly the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) would benefit from his study with Jibreel, such as learning the 
    variant recitations (huroof) of the Qur’aan and the meanings intended by 
    Allaah. If a person studies with someone who will help him to understand the 
    Qur’aan and help him to pronounce it properly, this is what is desirable, 
    just as the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) studied 
    it with Jibreel. The point is not that Jibreel was better than the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), but Jibreel was the 
    messenger who brought it from Allaah and conveyed to the Messenger  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that which Allaah had commanded 
    him, namely the Qur’aan and its pronunciation and meanings. So the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) benefited from Jibreel in 
    these ways. This does not mean that Jibreel was better than the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), for he is the best of mankind 
    and is better than the angels. But there was a great deal of goodness in 
    their studying the Qur’aan together, for the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) and for the ummah, because it was studying 
    what had come from Allaah in order to benefit from what had come from 
    Allaah. 

    There is another benefit in that, which is that studying 
    together at night is better than doing so during the day, because this study 
    used to take place at night, and it is known that the night is better for 
    studying than the day because one is better able to focus and concentrate 
    then. 

    Another benefit is that studying together is prescribed in 
    sharee’ah, and it is a righteous deed even if it is done at times other than 
    Ramadaan, because it benefits both parties. Even if there are more than two, 
    it doesn’t matter, because each of them can benefit from his brothers and 
    they can encourage one another to read. It may be that a person would not be 
    motivated to read if he sits on his own, but if he has a companion or 
    companions to study with him, that will encourage him to read, as well as 
    the benefits they will all share of studying and learning together. 

    It may be understood from that that the imam’s reading the 
    whole Qur’aan to the congregation during Ramadaan is a kind of this studying 
    together, because it enables them to listen to the whole Qur’aan. Hence Imam 
    Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on him) liked the one who was leading them in 
    prayer to complete the Qur’aan with them. This is akin to the practice of 
    the salaf who used to like to hear the whole of the Qur’aan, but this does 
    not mean that he should hasten and rush and not be deliberate in his reading 
    and humble, focused and at ease in his prayer. Rather paying attention to 
    these matters is more important than reciting the entire Qur’aan. 

    Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 
    11/331-333 

    Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    was also asked: 

    Many imams are keen to complete the Qur’aan in Taraaweeh and 
    they strive to let the congregation hear the entire Qur’aan. Is there 
    anything wrong with that? 

    He replied: 

    This is a good deed, so the imam may recite a juz’ or less 
    each night, then read more during the last ten nights so as to complete the 
    Qur’aan. This applies if it is easy for him to do so and will not cause any 
    hardship… The great scholar Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    wrote a chapter in his book Jala’ al-Afhaam fi’l-Salaati wa’l-Salaam ‘ala 
    Khayr al-Anaam, in which he described how the salaf were keen to 
    complete the Qur’aan; we advise you to read this chapter in order to learn 
    more.

How to pray on a chair


Where to put the chair in the row","Praise be to Allah.Standing, bowing and prostrating are pillars of the prayer
Standing, bowing and prostrating are pillars or essential parts of the prayer. Whoever can do them, it is obligatory for him to do them in the manner prescribed in the Shari`ah. Whoever is not able to do them because of sickness or old age, it is Sunnah for him to sit on the ground or on a chair . 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Guard strictly (five obligatory) As-Salawat (the prayers) especially the middle Salah (i.e. the best prayer - ‘Asr). And stand before Allah with obedience [and do not speak to others during the Salah (prayers)]” [al-Baqarah 2:238]
‘Imran ibn Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I had haemorrhoids so I asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about praying. He said: “Pray standing up; if you cannot, then pray sitting down; and if you cannot, then pray (lying) on your side.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1066) 
Ibn Qudamah al-Maqdisi said: 
“The scholars are unanimously agreed that if a person cannot stand then he may pray sitting down.” (Al-Mughni, 1/443) 
Al-Nawawi said: 
“The ummah is unanimously agreed that whoever is unable to stand during the obligatory prayer may pray sitting, and he does not have to repeat it. Our companions said: his reward will not be less than the reward for praying standing, because he is excused. It is proven in Sahih al-Bukhari that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If a person is sick or travelling, the same reward will be written for him with regard to what he used to do when he was not travelling and was healthy.” (Al-Majmu’, 4/226)
Al-Shawkani said: 
“The hadith of ‘Imran indicates that it is permissible for one who has an excuse and cannot stand to pray sitting, and for one who has an excuse and cannot pray sitting to pray lying on his side.” (Nayl al-Awtar, 3/243) 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: 
“The Muslims are agreed that if a worshipper is unable to do some of the obligatory duties of prayer, such as standing, reciting, bowing, prostrating , covering the ‘awrah, facing the qiblah etc, then what he is unable to do is waived for him. "" Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 8/437 ""
Based on that, if a person offers an obligatory prayer sitting when he is able to stand, his prayer is invalid. 
How to pray on a chair
It should be noted that if a person is exempted from standing, his excuse does not make it permissible for him to sit on the chair to bow and prostrate. 
If he is exempted from bowing and prostrating in the proper manner, that excuse does not make it permissible for him not to stand and to sit on the chair instead. 
The basic principle with regard to the obligatory duties of prayer is that whatever the worshipper can do, he is obliged to do it, and whatever he is unable to do, is waived for him. 
Whoever is unable to stand, it is permissible for him to sit on a chair during the standing, and he should bow and prostrate in the proper manner. If he is able to stand but it is difficult for him to bow and prostrate, he should pray standing, then sit on the chair when bowing and prostrating, and he should bend lower for the prostration than for the bowing.  
Ibn Qudamah al-Maqdisi said: 
“If a person is able to stand but he cannot bow or prostrate, the standing is not waived for him; he should pray standing and tilt his head for the bowing, then sit down and tilt his head for the prostration. This is the view of al-Shafi'i… 
Because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And stand before Allah with obedience” [al-Baqarah 2:238], and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Pray standing.” And because standing is one of the pillars (essential parts of prayer) for the one who is able to do it, so he must do it, like the recitation. Being unable to do other things does not mean that this is waived, as is also the case if he is unable to recite.” (Al-Mughni, 1/44) 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“The one who prays sitting on the ground or on a chair must make his prostration lower than his bowing. The Sunnah is for him to put his hands on his knees when bowing, and when prostrating the Sunnah is to put them on the ground if possible; if he cannot do that then he should put them on his knees, because it was proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I have been commanded to prostrate on seven bones: the forehead – and he pointed to his nose – the two hands, the two knees, and the edges of the two feet (i.e., the toes).” 
If a person is unable to do that and prays on a chair, there is nothing wrong with that, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can” [al-Taghabun 64:16]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If I tell you to do a thing, then do as much of it as you can.” Sahih – agreed upon.” (Fatawa Ibn Baz, 12/245, 246) 
Where to put the chair in the row
With regard to the placement of the chair in the row, the scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) stated that the one who prays sitting down should have his posterior in line with the row when he is sitting, so he should not be in front of the row or behind it at that point, because that is the place in which the body settles. (See Asna al-Matalib, 1/222; Tuhfat al-Muhtaj, 2/157; Sharh Muntaha al-Iradat, 1/279) 
It says in al-Mawsu’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (6/21): 
“In order for a person’s following the imam to be valid, he should not stand in front of the imam according to the majority of jurists (Hanafis, Shafi'is and Hanbalis). 
How do we know whether he is in front of the imam or not, it is judged by where the heels are. If they are standing level at the heel and the toes of the one who is praying behind the imam turn out to be in front because he has longer feet, that does not matter. With regard to those who are sitting, it is judged by where the posterior is. And with regard to those who are praying on their sides, it is judged by their sides.”   
If the worshipper is going to pray on the chair from the beginning of the prayer until the end, then he should make the place where he will sit level with the row. 
If he is going to pray standing, but he will sit on the chair when he bows and prostrates, we asked Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahman al-Barrak about that, and he said that what matters here is the standing position, so he should be level with the row when standing.  Based on this, the chair will be behind the row, so it should be placed in such a manner that it will not disturb worshippers in the row behind.

50687,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50687,He loves Islam but he cannot give up classical music!,"I am a person who believes in the existence of Allaah; no matter how far I stray from Allaah, I turn back to Him with humbleness. But I listen to classical music and I think that it is the best thing in my life. It does not provoke desire, rather it helps me to review myself and my mistakes. I feel that Islam is a backward religion when I hear those who say that all kinds of music are haraam. 
What is your opinion of a person who prays, fasts and calls non-Muslims to Islam, but he listens to clean music that is free of immoral content, or even of human voices?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
We were very happy to read your introduction and what you say about your belief in Allaah, may He be exalted, and that no matter how far you stray you come back to Him with humbleness. This is a characteristic that befits the wise who humble themselves before the greatness of their Lord, may He be blessed and exalted, who are certain of their weakness and the greatness of their need for Allaah to help them and guide them. 
Secondly: 
We were saddened by some of the phrases in your question, which we would not like to hear from such a wise believer, but when we thought about how many people there are who block the path of goodness, and how many there are who lead people astray and propagate corruption, we felt that such things are to be expected, but we are sure that they will soon cease. 
One of the things in your letter that saddened us was the fact that you listen to music, and say that it is the best thing in your life, and that it helps you to review yourself and your mistakes, and that you accuse Islam of backwardness when you hear that music is haraam.  
If you had thought hard about these phrases and sentences before writing them, your hand would never have written them and your lips would never had uttered them. But you have written them and sent them so we must pause and examine them, because of the duty of offering sincere advice that Allaah has enjoined upon us, and so as not to conceal knowledge that Islam has forbidden us to conceal. 
1 – With regard to music: 
It is forbidden and is not permissible to play musical instruments or listen to songs and tunes. The majority of scholars say that it is haraam, including the four imams of fiqh: Abu Haneefah, Maalik, al-Shaafa’i and Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on them all). 
The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Among my ummah there will be people who will regard as permissible adultery, silk, alcohol and musical instruments.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5590). See also: al-Silsilah al-Saheehah by al-Albaani (91). 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
This hadeeth indicates that musical instruments are haraam; this includes all types of instruments. 
Majmoo’ al-Fataawa (11/535). 
And he said: 
It is well known that during the best three generations of which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The best of generations are my generation among whom I was sent, and the one that follows them, and the one that follows them”, neither in the Hijaz nor in Syria nor in Yemen nor in Iraq nor in Egypt nor in Khorasan was there anyone among the people of goodness and religious commitment who would gather with others to listen to this innovated type of singing for the purpose of purifying the hearts. Hence it was regarded as makrooh by the imams such as Imam Ahmad and others, and al-Shaafa’i regarded it as one of the innovations of the zindeeqs (heretics) when he said: In Baghdad I left behind something that was innovated by the zindeeqs who called it taghbeer (a type of singing) and diverted the people from the Qur’aan thereby. 
Majmoo’ al-Fataawa (10/77). 
See also the answer to question no. 5000 and 5011. 
Ibn al-Qayyim said: If the zamr (a kind of pipe or flute),which is the least evil of musical instruments, is haraam, then what about those which are worse such as the ‘oud (a stringed instrument), tambour (drum) and yaraa’  (a reed instrument)? No one who has had the slightest whiff of knowledge should hesitate to regard them as haraam, and the least that can be said is that they are the symbol of corrupt evildoers and wine drinkers. 
Ighaathat al-Lahfaan (1/228). 
2 – With regard to your saying that it is the best thing in your life, this is something astounding. What about the Qur’aan? What about the hadeeths of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)? How can you prefer the words of man to the words of Allaah, may He be exalted? How can you think that musical instruments are better for your heart and soul and mind than the words of Allaah, may He be exalted, and the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)? 
Remember – may Allaah guide you and enlighten you – that the Qur’aan of the Most Merciful and the “recitation” of the Shaytaan – namely songs – cannot be joined together in the heart of the believer. You would not say that music and songs are the best thing in your life unless you have been deprived of the Qur’aan of the Most Merciful. Remember that the Shaytaan cannot make songs and music attractive to you in your heart and in your life until after he has turned you away from the Book of Allaah, may He be exalted. So you have to hasten to set your heart aright and turn back from what you are doing, so that you can strengthen your heart by obeying the Most Merciful and His words, and humbling yourself before His rulings. 
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
What is meant is that forbidden songs are the “recitation” of the Shaytaan, because when the enemy of Allaah wanted to bring together these wrongdoers, he resorted to making music and musical instruments attractive to them, and if it comes from a beautiful woman or a handsome boy, that is more likely to make his “recitation” attractive to them, and to replace the joy of the Glorious Qur’aan with the joy of listening to music. 
Ighaathat al-Lahfaan (1/254) 
3 – With regard to your saying that music helps you to review yourself and your mistakes, this is also very strange. What about reviewing yourself when you wrote these words? Did you review yourself when you said “it is the best thing in my life”? or that “Islam is backward if it forbids it”? 
Did you review yourself and your mistakes with music and then offer prayers on time, or observe voluntary fasts, or pray at night when people are sleeping, or uphold family ties, or spend your money for the sake of Allaah, or seek Islamic knowledge? We are certain that music did not help you with these things and that whatever you did of them, music was not the cause behind them. 
Remember that thinking of death, the grave, the meeting with Allaah and what Allaah has prepared for the sinners is what makes the Muslim review himself time after time, and improve his life for the better, and erase his sins and mistakes from his life. You should be certain that if what you say had any shred of truth, you would see the musicians and those who listen to music among the best and most moral of people, but is that in fact the case? 
4 – As for your accusing Islam of being backward when you hear of the prohibition on music, this is the most serious thing that you have said. You have read what your Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, and you know what all the scholars, including the four imams, have said. So all you have to do is be obedient to your Lord, may He be exalted, and respond to the command of your Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), following the way of goodness, knowledge and obedience that was followed by the Sahaabah, Tabi’een and those who came after them. How can you compare between the ruling of Allaah and your own reasoning? How can you spurn the way that was followed by the best of mankind and follow a different way that none of the righteous ever followed? 
Remember that the religion of Allaah does not follow the whims and desires of anyone. Allaah is the One Who has created the universe and mankind, and He knows what is best for them in this life and in the Hereafter, so He issues commands and prohibitions for what is best for them in both realms. 
Thirdly: 
We are happy to learn that you are one of those who call people to this religion, and that you are among those who pray and fast, but we wish you well and whatever advice we give is that which is best for you. Carry on with your worship and calling people to Islam, but beware of sin and beware of this music and the immoral words that may accompany it. Songs generate hypocrisy in the heart and make it sick; they do not guide to any good or forbid any evil, on the contrary these songs promote love and haraam meetings, and even if these instruments are not accompanied by words, they still make the heart sick and do it no good. 
Allaah has given you something better than this, namely His Book, in which He speaks. So read it and listen to it being read by readers whom Allaah has blessed with beautiful voices, and you will see a great difference in your heart and your life after that. Allaah has guided many people who were kuffaar after they listened to the verses of the Qur’aan, and you are more deserving of being guided in this manner than others. 
You can also listen to permissible nasheeds, which are filled with good words, wisdom and exhortation, and you can enjoy listening to sounds that Allaah has created, such as the sounds of birds and waves, for they are what still the heart, not the sounds of musical instruments that Islam has forbidden us to use. 
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) discussed singing in detail in his book Ighaathat al-Lahfaan min Masaa’id al-Shaytaan; try to get a copy and read it, for you will find much useful material in it, in sha Allaah. 
Finally: 
The best advice we can give you is to fear Allaah, may He be exalted, and to seek knowledge from sound sources. Read Qur’aan a great deal and listen to it being read by those who read it well. Turn to Allaah with du’aa’, asking Him to set your affairs straight. 
We ask Allaah to guide you to all that is good.

50692,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50692,She did not fast for many days because she was unaware of the ruling and does not know how many days they were,"I do not know how many days I did not fast in the past when I was with my family, because we were living in a village and no one knew anything about the rulings on fasting. I did not fast during those days, and I do not know how many days I did not fast. I paid some money for those days, and then I found out from one of the sisters that I have to make up those days, but I do not know how many days there are. What should I do?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The Muslim has to learn the rulings of Islam that he needs to know, whether they are matters of ‘aqeedah (belief) and usool al-deen, or practical matters such as purity (tahaarah) and prayer. If he is wealthy then he has to learn the rulings on zakaah. If he is a businessman then he has to learn the rulings on financial transactions, and so on. When the month of Ramadaan is approaching, the Muslim who is accountable has to learn the rulings of fasting even if he is unable to fast, so that he may learn what he has to do instead of fasting. 
So what you and your family have to do is to repent to Allaah and pray for forgiveness for your failure to ask and seek knowledge concerning this matter. 
It is not permissible to give money, even for those who are unable to fast such as the elderly and chronically sick, because what they must do if they do not fast in Ramadaan is to feed one poor person for each day. Giving money instead of food for the days when they did not fast is not sufficient. 
Based on this, we hope that the money you gave will count as charity for which you will be rewarded on the Day of Resurrection. 
What you have to do is to make up those days when you did not fast. You can try to work them out until you reach the number which you are certain of. If you cannot do that then do what you think is most likely. If you think it most likely that the number is thirty days, for example, then you have to fast these days.  
“Allaah burdens not a person beyond his scope”
[al-Baqarah 2:286]
You do not have to fast them one after another, rather it is permissible for you to fast them separately, according to what you are able to do. But you have to hasten to fast them and do not delay them again. 
You should start by making up the Ramadaan of the last year first, so that the next Ramadaan will not come before you have observed these fasts. 
Some of the scholars stated that as well as fasting you have to feed one poor person for each day, to make up for delaying the fast. But the more correct view is that you have to fast only, especially if you are poor. But if you can feed others as well as fast, that is good. 
See also the answers to questions no. 39742, 26212, 40695. 
All of this is based on the assumption that you did not fast for a legitimate reason, such as menstruation. But if you had no legitimate excuse for breaking the fast, then you do not have to make up the fast, rather you have to repent to Allaah and pray for His forgiveness, and compensate for these days by observing naafil fasts and doing good deeds.

 Is it possible to determine the date of Laylat al-Qadr?","Praise be to Allah.Virtue of doing acts of worship on Laylat al-Qadr 
There are reports which speak of the great virtue of doing acts of worship on Laylat al-Qadr . Our Lord, may He be blessed and exalted, has told us that it is better than a thousand nights, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said that whoever spends this night in prayer out of faith and in the hope of reward will be forgiven his previous sins. 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, We have sent it (this Quran) down in the Night of Al-Qadr (Decree). And what will make you know what the Night of Al-Qadr (Decree) is? The Night of Al-Qadr (Decree) is better than a thousand months (i.e. worshipping Allah in that night is better than worshipping Him a thousand months, i.e. 83 years and 4 months). Therein descend the angels and the Ruh [Jibril (Gabriel)] by Allah’s Permission with all Decrees, (All that night), there is peace (and goodness from Allah to His believing slaves) until the appearance of dawn.” [al-Qadr 97:1-5] 
Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever spends this night in prayer out of faith and in the hope of reward will be forgiven his previous sins.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1901; Muslim, 760) 
Out of faith means believing in its virtue and in the reward for that. In the hope of reward means by seeking the pleasure of Allah. 
When is Laylat al-Qadr?
The scholars differed as to the definition of Laylat al-Qadr, and there are many opinions, more than forty as it says in Fath al-Bari. The most likely to be correct is the view that it is one of the odd-numbered nights among the last ten nights of Ramadan. 
`Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Seek Laylat al-Qadr among the odd numbered nights of the last ten nights of Ramadan.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2017; Muslim, 1169) 
Al-Bukhari included this hadith in a chapter entitled: “Seeking Laylat al-Qadr among the odd numbered nights of the last ten nights (of Ramadan).” 
Why don’t we know which night is Laylat al-Qadr?
The reason why it is hidden is to encourage the Muslim to strive hard in worship and du`a and dhikr during all the last ten nights of Ramadan. This is the same reason why the time when du`a is answered on Friday has not been defined, and why the ninety-names of Allah have not been defined, concerning which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever learns them by heart will enter Paradise.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2736; Muslim, 2677) 
Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“The words of Imam al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) – “Seeking Laylat al-Qadr among the odd numbered nights of the last ten nights (of Ramadan)” – indicate that it is most likely that Laylat al-Qadr cannot be in any month other than Ramadan, and is in the last ten nights thereof, and is one of the odd-numbered nights, but not on any particular night. This is what is indicated by a number of the reports that have been narrated concerning it.” (Fath al-Bari, 4/260) 
And he said: 
“The scholars said: The reason why Laylat al-Qadr has been concealed is so that people will strive to seek it, because if its timing was known, they would limit their efforts to that night only, as we have explained previously about the time on Friday (when du’as are answered).” (Fath al-Bari, 4/266) 
 Is it possible to determine the date of Laylat al-Qadr? 
Based on this, it is not possible for anyone to be certain that a particular night is Laylat al-Qadr , especially since we know that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wanted to tell his ummah when it was, then he told them that Allah had taken away that knowledge. 
`Ubadah ibn al-Samit (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came out with the news of Laylat al-Qadr, but two men among the Muslims started arguing. He said: “I came out to tell you about Laylat al-Qadr, but So and So and So and So started arguing, so (that knowledge) was taken away. Perhaps that will be better for you. So seek it on the (twenty-) seventh and the (twenty-) ninth and the (twenty-) fifth.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 49) 
The scholars of the Standing Committee said: 
“With regard to singling out one night of Ramadan as Laylat al-Qadr , this requires evidence to show that it is this night and not any other. But the odd numbered nights of the last ten nights of Ramadan are more likely than others (to be Laylat al-Qadr) and the twenty-seventh night is the most likely night to be Laylat al-Qadr, because of the hadiths to that effect.” (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah li’l-Buhuth al-‘Ilmiyyah wa’l-Ifta, 10/413) 
Hence the Muslim should not assume that any particular night is Laylat al-Qadr , because that would mean that he is being certain about something concerning which we cannot be certain, and because it means that he is missing out on something that is good for him. It may be the night of the twenty-first, or the twenty-third, or the twenty-ninth. If he spends the night of the twenty-seventh only in prayer, then he will have missed out on a lot of goodness, and he may have missed that blessed night. 
The Muslim should strive his hardest to do acts of obedience and worship throughout Ramadan, and more so in the last ten days . This is the teaching of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).  
`Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “When the last ten days of Ramadan began, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would tighten his waist-wrapper, spend his nights in prayer, and wake his family.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2024; Muslim, 1174) 
And Allah knows best.",Islam Q&A
50699,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50699,Are there any saheeh ahaadeeth which speak of the ransoming of the living and the dead during Ramadaan?,"I heard from someone that Allaah ransoms just one of the dead Muslims every night, and that He does not ransom any of the living except on the last night of Ramadaan, when He ransoms the same number as the number of dead whom He ransomed during the month. Is this true?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
      After researching the matter, we did not find any ahaadeeth 
      which say such a thing. 

    There are ahaadeeth which say that Allaah ransoms people from 
    the Fire during Ramadaan, and that happens every night. 

    Some of these ahaadeeth are saheeh (sound), some are da’eef 
    (weak),  and some are mawdoo’ (fabricated). 

    Among the saheeh ahaadeeth which speak of that are the 
    following: 

    1 – It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased 
    with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) said: “When the first night of Ramadaan comes, the devils and 
    mischievous jinn are chained up, and the gates of Hell are closed, and none 
    of its gates are opened. The gates of Paradise are opened and none of its 
    gates are closed. And a caller cries out: ‘O seeker of good, proceed; O 
    seeker of evil, desist.’ And Allaah has people whom He frees (from the 
    Fire), and that happens every day.” 

    Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 682; Ibn Maajah, 1642; classed as 
    hasan by Shaykh al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 759. 

    2 – It was narrated that Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with 
    him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “At every breaking of the fast Allaah has people whom He 
    redeems from the Fire, and that happens every night.”

    Narrated by Ahmad, 21698; Ibn Maajah, 1643; classed as saheeh 
    by Shaykh al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah. 
The da’eef (weak) and 
    mawdoo’ (fabricated) ahaadeeth that have been narrated on this topic include 
    the following: 
1 – The report narrated 
    from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him), according to which the 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “When the first night of Ramadaan comes, Allaah looks at His creation, and 
    if Allaah looks at a person He will never punish him. And every day Allaah 
    has one thousand thousand whom He ransoms from the Fire. On the twenty-ninth 
    night Allaah ransoms a number equivalent to the number whom He has already 
    ransomed during the entire month.” 

    This is a mawdoo’ hadeeth. See Da’eef al-Targheeb, 591 
    and al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah, 5468. 
2 – It was narrated from 
    Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) that he heard the Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “Paradise is 
    scented with incense and adorned throughout the year, in preparation for the 
    beginning of the month of Ramadaan. On the first night of the month of 
    Ramadaan, a wind called al-matheerah comes from beneath the Throne… And on 
    each day of the month of Ramadaan at the time of breaking the fast, Allaah 
    has one thousand thousand whom He ransoms from the Fire, all of whom 
    deserved to go to Hell. And on the last day of the month of Ramadaan, Allaah 
    ransoms on that day a number equivalent to all those whom He ransomed from 
    the beginning of the month to the end. 

    This is a mawdoo’ hadeeth. See Da’eef al-Targheeb, 
    594. 
3 – It was narrated that 
    al-Hasan said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) said: “Every night of Ramadaan Allaah has six hundred thousand 
    whom He ransoms from the Fire. And on the last night Allaah ransoms a number 
    equivalent to those whom He has already ransomed.”  

    This is a da’eef hadeeth. See Da’eef al-Targheeb, 598.",Islam Q&A
