42909,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/42909,"Taking a card and giving money to its owner and five other people, in a pyramid scheme","I took a card from a friend of mine and I have to pay $100 for this card, and $100 to the person who gave the card to my friend, and $100 to five people who did the same thing, one after the other (i.e., like a chain letter or something similar). The sixth person takes $800 and the company that is in charge of this takes $800. It carries on like this until everyone who sends the card gets $400. If he gives four cards to four people, and each of them gives the card to another person, the first one will get $1600 and so on. 
Is it permissible to take part in this scheme?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.This scheme involves gambling and consuming people’s wealth unlawfully, both of which are clearly forbidden as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Intoxicants (all kinds of alcoholic drinks), and gambling, and Al‑Ansaab (stone altars for sacrifices to idols, jinn, etc), and Al‑Azlaam (arrows for seeking luck or decision) are an abomination of Shaytaan’s (Satan’s) handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) in order that you may be successful.
91. Shaytaan (Satan) wants only to excite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants (alcoholic drinks) and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of Allaah and from As‑Salaah (the prayer). So, will you not then abstain?”
[al-Maa’idah 5:90-91]
“O you who believe! Eat not up your property among yourselves unjustly except it be a trade amongst you, by mutual consent”
[al-Nisa’ 4:29]
The way in which this scheme involves gambling is that the person who joins it spends his money and gets nothing in return, hoping that he will get more money. So he is not certain whether he will win or lose, and this is the definition of gambling. 
The way in which it involves consuming people’s wealth unlawfully is obvious. No one gains money from this scheme except the ones who set it up and a small number of those who join it; most of them come out with nothing but sin and regret. 
Hence in some western countries such schemes are known as pyramids of illusion or selling air. 
Dr Waa’il Ghunaym, the head of marketing in an e-mail company says: 
This idea is based on a principle that is akin to gambling, whereby each person puts his money on the table then the one who is the most eloquent and persuasive takes it all.  Joining the scheme earlier also plays a role in acquiring the thousands upon thousands, because the one who starts it and those who follow him, up to a certain level of the pyramid – which varies according to how big the company grows and how many levels there are in the pyramid – are the ones who will earn the large amounts of money. They are like the gamblers who win big. Their intelligence plays no role in their huge earnings, all that they do is to convince a number of people to join and they sit and watch what their followers will do and so on. It remains that the first one is better off, and the pyramid has different levels, as follows: 
1 – The kings of the pyramids of illusion. They are the ones who will earn huge amounts because they joined it first and their numbers are few 
2 – The dealers of the pyramids of illusion. They are the ones who will earn something but it will be a very ordinary amount and not that on which they pinned their hopes. Their number is also few. 
3 – Those who escape unscathed from the pyramids of illusion. They are the ones who will neither win nor lose, but they managed to get back the money that they paid in. Their number is moderate. 
4 – The victims of the pyramid, who are more than 80 % of those who join the scheme. Their number is greater the more levels there are in the pyramid. 
The number of those who are able to convince others to join becomes greater the more levels the pyramid acquires. This clearly shows us that the greater earnings can only come when more losers join the scheme, because the company will make profits, and the kings and dealers will make a profit, and this mathematical equation can only be achieved at the expense of victims of the illusion, who donated their wealth to the kings and dealers of the pyramid. 
And he said: 
On January 5, 2000 the department of consumer protection in one of the states of the US issued a warning about a club that was using its membership cards as a means to propagate these pyramids of illusion. The Trade Department in that state had already warned about these pyramid schemes and described them as follows: they promise a quick and certain profit, and they tell everyone of how successful this idea has been for some workers who joined the scheme. They are based on face-to-face meetings in which they use psychological pressure so that a person does not think and signs up as soon as the presentation ends. The Department stated that these pyramid schemes are based on lies and that very few of those who join will make any gains. 
The Canadian government added a clause to its Criminal Code expressly forbidding any individual or organization to operate pyramid schemes. The government described these schemes as a program in which a person pays a sum of money to join the group, in return for attending lectures or getting some educational material on this subject, then he is required to try to persuade a certain number of people to do the same. The Canadian police website states that millions of dollars were collected from people who joined the scheme and lost their money, whilst a very small number of people acquired a huge amount of money. 
Robert Carols, author of False Profits, published a detailed analysis which proves to all that these pyramid schemes are no more than a fraud that is based on a large number of participants, in which only the people at the top of the pyramid gain anything; they are usually the owner of the company and the original members with him.  
The Standing Committee has been asked about various forms of such schemes, and they have stated that they are all haraam and that they are kinds of riba and gambling. 
It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (15/212):  
If the matter is as described, then this scheme is a kind of gambling that Allaah has forbidden in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Intoxicants (all kinds of alcoholic drinks), and gambling, and Al‑Ansaab (stone altars for sacrifices to idols, jinn, etc), and Al‑Azlaam (arrows for seeking luck or decision) are an abomination of Shaytaan’s (Satan’s) handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) in order that you may be successful.”
[al-Maa'idah 5:90]
And they also said (15/215): 
This kind of operation is not permissible, rather it is an evil action and one of the worst of major sins, because it involves riba al-fadl and riba al-nasee’ah, both of which are haraam according to the consensus of the Muslims. And it involves toying with people’s wealth and consuming it unlawfully. In this sense it comes under the ruling on gambling which is haraam according to the texts of Islam and according to scholarly consensus. 
And they also said (15/218):  
The transactions mentioned involve ambiguity, riba and gambling, all of which are major sins that incur the wrath and anger of Allaah.",Islam Q&A
42919,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/42919,Meaning of the hadeeth: “The Shaytaan has despaired of ever being worshipped by the worshippers in the Arabian Peninsula”,"It is narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The Shaytaan has despaired of ever being worshipped by the worshippers in the Arabian Peninsula.” In another hadeeth it says: “Night and day will not cease until al-Laat and al-‘Uzza are worshipped.” And in another hadeeth it says: “Until the buttocks of the women of Daws bump into one another going around Dhu’l-Khalasah.” 

My question is: from the first hadeeth it may be understood that no shirk will ever be committed in the Arabian Peninsula. Whereas the second hadeeth indicates that it will be committed.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
      One of the things that are established by the scholars is 
      that shirk will take place in the ummah as is indicated by the sound 
      texts, and reality confirms this. 

    Many of the Arabs apostatized after the death of the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and many of them went back 
    to worshipping idols. 

    The mujaddid (renewer of the Faith) Muhammad ibn ‘Abd 
    al-Wahhaab said: “Chapter: Reports that some of this ummah will worship 
    idols”, then he mentioned some ahaadeeth which indicate that.  

    With regard to the hadeeth: “The Shaytaan has despaired of 
    ever being worshipped…” the scholars have interpreted it in several ways: 

    1 – That the Shaytaan has despaired of ever getting all 
    worshippers to unite on kufr. 

    This view was favoured by the great scholar Ibn Rajab 
    al-Hanbali. Al-Darar al-Sunnah, 12/117. 
2 – That this is a report 
    of the despair that befell the Shaytaan when he saw the conquests and how 
    the people entered the religion of Allaah in crowds. So the hadeeth is 
    telling us what the Shaytaan thought and he expected to happen. Then what 
    really happened was something other than that, for a reason decreed by 
    Allaah. 

    This view was favoured by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah 
    have mercy on him). Al-Qawl al-Mufeed, 1/211. 
3 – That the Shaytaan 
    despaired of the believers whose faith is complete, because the Shaytaan has 
    no hope that they will worship him. 

    This view was favoured by al-Aloosi. See Da’aawa 
    al-Munaawi’een, 224. 

    4 – That the “al-” in the word “al-musalloon” (worshippers) 
    refers to a specific group of worshippers, and that what is meant is the 
    Sahaabah. 

    All of these interpretations are close in meaning, and the 
    most likely is the second. And Allaah knows best. 

    See Ahaadeeth al-‘Aqeedah allati yuwahham Zaahiruha 
    al-Ta’aarud fi’l-Saheehayn, 2/232-238 .",Islam Q&A
42935,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/42935,Some people make a great deal of du’aa’ but receive no answer,"What is the reason for the delay in response to du’aa’? Some people make du’aa’ but they do not get any response; they ask for a long time but do not see it having any effect, so you find the Shaytaan starting to whisper to such people and making them think badly of their Lord.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
      Firstly: 

    The one to whom that happens should believe that there is a 
    reason and great wisdom behind the delay in the response. Allaah, may He be 
    glorified, is the Sovereign of all and none can put back His bounty or 
    overturn His ruling or object to His giving or His withholding, if He gives 
    by His bounty or withholds by His justice. We are His slaves and He does 
    with us whatever He will. 

    “And your Lord creates whatsoever He wills and chooses, no 
    choice have they (in any matter)”

    [al-Qasas 28:68]

    How can a slave fall short in honouring his master’s rights 
    and then demand his rights in full? 

    It is His right to be obeyed and not disobeyed, to be 
    remembered and not forgotten, to be thanked and not to be shown ingratitude. 
    If you look at yourself and how you are carrying out your duties, you would 
    think very little of yourself and you would feel humility and would realize 
    there can be no salvation except by His forgiveness and mercy. So look at 
    yourself as being a slave, for Allaah is the Creator and Controller. 

    Secondly: 

    Allaah has great wisdom and He does not give or withhold 
    except for a reason. You may look at something and think that it is good but 
    by His wisdom He does not decree it. A doctor may do things which appear to 
    be painful but they are in the patient’s best interests. And for Allaah is 
    the highest description. (cf. al-Nahl 16:60). 

    Thirdly: 

    Attainting the thing asked for may cause hardship to the one 
    who is asking. It was narrated from one of the salaf that he used to ask 
    Allaah to let him go out on a military campaign, but a voice called out to 
    him: “If you go on a military campaign you will be taken prisoner, and if 
    you are taken prisoner, you will become a Christian.” Sayd al-Khaatir, 
    1/109 

    Ibn al-Qayyim said: Whatever Allaah has decreed for His 
    believing slave is a blessing even if that is in the form of withholding; it 
    is a favour even if that is in the form of a trial, and the calamity decreed 
    by him is fair even if it us painful. Madaarij al-Saalikeen, 4/215. 

    No one knows how his affairs will end up. He may ask for 
    something which leads to bad consequences, and may even harm him. The 
    Controller knows best what is in his best interests. “and it may be that 
    you dislike a thing which is good for you” [al-Baqarah 2:216]. One of 
    the meanings of this verse is that we should not wish that the decree of our 
    Lord was different or ask Him for things of which we have no knowledge, for 
    perhaps that may harm us without us knowing. So we should not choose 
    anything different than what our Lord has chosen for us, rather we should 
    ask Him for a good end in what He has chosen for us, for there is nothing 
    more beneficial for us than that. 

    Fourthly: 

    What Allaah chooses for His slave is better for him that what 
    he chooses for himself. Allaah is more merciful towards His slaves than they 
    themselves or their mothers are. If something happens to them that they 
    dislike, that is better for them than if it did not happen, so His decree is 
    all kindness and mercy. If the slave submits to Allaah and has certain faith 
    that all dominion belongs to Allaah and all things are under His command, 
    and that He is more merciful to him than he is himself, then he will find 
    peace of mind regardless of whether his need is met or not. 

    See Madaarij al-Saalikeen, 2/215 

    Fifthly: 

    The response may be delayed because the person himself has 
    done something which is an impediment to receiving a response or a cause of 
    delay. Perhaps there is something haraam in his food, or perhaps there was 
    some negligence in his heart at the time when he made the du’aa’, or perhaps 
    he had committed a sin, as a consequence of which his du’aa’ was not 
    answered. So when the response to the du’aa’ is delayed, this may prompt the 
    person to check on himself and examine how he stands before his Lord, so 
    that he will take stock of himself and repent; if the answer to his prayer 
    came sooner, perhaps he would become heedless and think that he was doing 
    fine, then he would develop a sense of self-admiration that may lead to his 
    doom. 

    Delay or withholding of a response may be because Allaah 
    wants to delay the reward for him until the Day of Resurrection, or Allaah 
    wants to divert an equivalent evil from him, but he does not realize that. 

    Whatever the case, the fruits of du’aa’ are guaranteed, even 
    if you do not see the response with your own eyes. So think well of your 
    Lord and say: Perhaps He has answered me in a way that I do not know. It is 
    narrated in a saheeh report that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no Muslim who does not offer any du’aa’ 
    in which there is no sin or severing of family ties but Allaah will give him 
    one of three things in return: either He will answer his du’aa’ sooner, or 
    he will store it up for him in the Hereafter, or He will divert an 
    equivalent evil away from him because of it.” They said: “We will say a lot 
    of du’aa’.” He said: “Allaah is more generous.” Narrated by Ahmad, 10749. 
    al-Albaani said in Saheeh al-Targheeb wa’l-Tarheeb: it is hasan 
    saheeh. 

    In conclusion, there are many reasons why a du’aa’ may not be 
    answered or the answer may be delayed; we must ponder this and not stop 
    making du’aa’, for du’aa’ will always be of benefit.

    that. This is the attitude of every believer – he puts his trust in Allaah, believes in Him and relies on Him. 
But with regard to the phrase, ‘and I seek 
    the protection of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)’, these are reprehensible words. Seeking the protection 
    of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) after his death is not permissible. 
Seeking his protection during his lifetime

42970,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/42970,"The Dajjaal will emerge at the end of time, so why did the Prophets warn their people about him? And when and where will he emerge?",Why did the Prophets warn their people about the Dajjaal when he will not emerge until the end of time? And when will the Dajjaal emerge?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
The greatest fitnah (trial, tribulation) on 
    the face of the earth since the creation of Adam until the onset of the Hour will be the fitnah of the Dajjaal, as the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said. Hence there is no Prophet, from Nooh to Muhammad (may the blessings and peace of Allaah be upon them all), 
    who did not warn his people about him, as an indication of have serious his fitnah will be. Although Allaah knows that he will not emerge until 
    the end of time, nevertheless He commanded the Messengers to warn their people about him so that they would understand how serious the matter is. 
    It was narrated that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If he emerges whilst I am still among you, then I will 
    suffice you against him, otherwise each man should take care of himself, d Allah will take care of every Muslim on my behalf (and safeguard him 
    against his evil).” Muslim, 5228. 
The Dajjaal is a serious matter, indeed he is 
    the greatest fitnah, as it says in the hadeeth, since the creation of Adam and until the Hour begins. No wonder that he is the only one of the 
    trials of life from which refuge is sought in prayer: “A’oodhu Billaah min ‘adhaab Jahannam wa min ‘adhaab il qabri wa min fitnat il-mahyaa 
    wa’l-mamaat wa min fitnat il-maseeh il-dajjaal (I seek refuge with Allaah from the torment of Hell, the torment of the grave, the trials of 
    life and death and the trial of the Dajjaal).” 
The word Dajjaal comes from the word dajl, 
    which means misrepresentation or falsification, because he is a falsifier, indeed the greatest falsifier and the worst liar of all people. 
Secondly: 
The appearance of the Dajjaal is one of the 
    signs of the Hour, but the time of his emergence is not clearly defined, because no one knows when the Hour will be except Allaah. Similarly with 
    regard to the portents of the Hour, all we know is what has already happened (but with regard to those which have not yet happened, we do not know 
    when they will happen).  The time of his appearance is not known, but we do know that it is one of the portents of the Hour. 
Thirdly: 
With regard to the direction from which he 
    will emerge, he will emerge from the east, from the direction of tribulation and evil, as the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said: “Fitnah is here,” and he pointed towards the east. (al-Bukhaari, 3279; Muslim, 5167). So the east is the source of evil and 
    tribulation, and he will emerge from the east, from Khurasaan, passing through Isfahan and entering the Arabian Peninsula from a point between 
    Syria and Iraq, with no goal but Madeenah, because there lies the Bringer of glad tidings and warnings  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him). He will want to destroy the people of Madeenah, but it will be forbidden to him, as was narrated from the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him): “At every gate thereof will be angels guarding it.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1880; Muslim, 2449. This man will emerge 
    between Syria and Iraq, and seventy thousand of the Jews of Isfahan will follow him, because they are his troops. (Narrated by Muslim, 5237). The 
    Jews are among the most evil of the slaves of Allaah, and he is the most misguided of the slaves of Allaah. So they will follow him and support 
    him, and they will be his troops, they and others who follow him. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “O slaves of 
    Allaah, stand firm; O slaves of Allaah, stand firm.” Narrated by Muslim, 5228. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) urged 
    us to stand firm, because the matter is serious. And he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever hears of the Dajjaal, let 
    him flee from him, for by Allaah, a man will come to him thinking that he is a believer, then he will follow him because of the specious arguments 
    he puts forward.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 3762; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.
 A man will come to him and say, “He will 
    never lead me astray and I will never be affected by him,” but he will keep producing specious arguments until he follows him – we seek refuge 
    with Allaah from that. We ask Allaah to protect us with His protection. Praise be to Allaah the Lord of the Worlds.","From Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him), 2/13"

    It is obligatory to do ghusl with water to cleanse oneself of 
    janaabah, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! 
    Approach not As-Salaah (the prayer) when you are in a drunken state until 
    you know (the meaning) of what you utter, nor when you are in a state of 
    Janaaba (i.e. in a state of sexual impurity and have not yet taken a bath), 
    except when travelling on the road (without enough water, or just passing 
    through a mosque), till you wash your whole body. And if you are ill, or on 
    a journey, or one of you comes after answering the call of nature, or you 
    have been in contact with women (by sexual relations) and you find no water, 
    perform Tayammum with clean earth and rub therewith your faces and hands 
    (Tayammum). Truly, Allaah is Ever Oft-Pardoning, Oft-Forgiving”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:43]

    “O you who believe! When you intend to offer As-Salaah 
    (the prayer), wash your faces and your hands (forearms) up to the elbows, 
    rub (by passing wet hands over) your heads, and (wash) your feet up to the 
    ankles. If you are in a state of Janaaba (i.e. after a sexual discharge), 
    purify yourselves (bathe your whole body). But if you are ill or on a 
    journey, or any of you comes after answering the call of nature, or you have 
    been in contact with women (i.e. sexual intercourse), and you find no water, 
    then perform Tayammum with clean earth and rub therewith your faces and 
    hands. Allaah does not want to place you in difficulty, but He wants to 
    purify you, and to complete His Favour to you that you may be thankful”

    [al-Maa’idah 5:6]

    And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said: “ ‘Clean earth’ is the wudoo’ of the Muslim even if he cannot 
    find water for ten years, but if he finds water then let him fear Allaah and 
    let it touch his skin for that is good for him.” Narrated by al-Bazaar; 
    classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, no. 3861. 
It is not permissible to 
    do tayammum unless one has an excuse for not using water, such as none being 
    available, or if using it will cause harm, because of the verse quoted 
    above. 

    With regard to not doing ghusl because you feel shy, this is 
    not permissible and tayammum is not sufficient in this case, and prayer is 
    not valid if you do tayammum. You should put your fear of Allaah above your 
    fear of people, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Therefore fear not men but fear Me”

    [al-Maa’idah 5:44]

    “Do you fear them? Allaah has more right that you should 
    fear Him if you are believers”

    [al-Tawbah 9:13]

    The kind of shyness that prevents you doing obligatory 
    actions is a blameworthy kind of shyness, indeed it is a kind of weakness 
    and incapability. It has nothing to do with the praiseworthy kind of 
    shyness. 

    In order to make you feel less embarrassed, you can do ghusl 
    at times when they will not notice it, such as before dawn, or you can use 
    the water in such a way that they will not hear it and no one will know that 
    you are doing ghusl, and so on, which will help to conceal the things that 
    may be causing you to feel shy.

42992,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/42992,She committed incest with her brother – should she tell her husband?,"Between the ages of 10 and 14 she committed immoral actions with her brother who was three years older than her, but intercourse did not take place. Then she grew up and realized that she was sinning, and she and her brother gave up this action and regretted it deeply.   

She fell in love with a young man and did everything with him except intercourse. 

Should she tell her husband in the future of what she did with her brother in the past? Is it true that her parents’ marriage is regarded as null and void because of what they did? How should the relationship be between her children and her brother’s children in the future? How can she repent and seek forgiveness for her sins? Will her sin be forgiven if she says “Yaa Ghafoor, yaa Raheem, yaa ‘Afuw” repeatedly?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.What you have to do is to 
    repent to Allaah and seek His forgiveness for what you have done. What you 
    have done is no minor matter. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And come 
    not near to unlawful sex. Verily, it is a Faahishah (i.e. anything that 
    transgresses its limits: a great sin, and an evil way that leads one to hell 
    unless Allaah Forgives him)”
[al-Isra’ 
    17:32]
What you and your brother 
    did is a kind of approaching zina (unlawful sex). Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And 
    those who invoke not any other ilaah (god) along with Allaah, nor kill such 
    person as Allaah has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal 
    sexual intercourse  
    and whoever does this shall receive the punishment.
The 
    torment will be doubled to him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide 
    therein in disgrace;
Except 
    those who repent and believe (in Islamic Monotheism), and do righteous 
    deeds; for those, Allaah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allaah 
    is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful”

    [al-Furqaan 25:68]
And the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “O ummah of 
    Muhammad, by Allaah there is none more indignant than Allaah when His slave, 
    male or female, commits zina. O ummah of Muhammad, if you knew what I know, 
    you would laugh little and weep much.” 
Narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari, 1044; Muslim, 901. 
So what you 
    and your brother have to do is to repent to Allaah from what you have done, 
    and to do a lot of righteous deeds such as praying, fasting and giving 
    charity, so as to atone for your evil actions. 
What 
    happened between you and that man is another sin. Our advice to you is to 
    check yourself and realize that when Allaah becomes angry with His slave He 
    dooms him and removes blessing from his entire life, if he does not repent 
    and turn back to his Lord. 
With regard 
    to telling your husband about what has happened to you in the past, you do 
    not have to do that once you have repented from it. You should cover 
    yourself and not speak openly of something that you have done in the past. 
    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “All of 
    my ummah will be forgiven except those who commit sin blatantly. It is 
    committing sin blatantly if a man does something at night, then in the 
    morning when Allaah has concealed him, he says, ‘O So and so, I did such and 
    such last night,’ when all night his Lord has concealed him, and he uncovers 
    that which Allaah has concealed.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6069; Muslim, 
    2990. 
Your 
    parents’ marriage is not regarded as null and void, because there is not 
    connection between what happened and your parents’ marriage.  
“And no 
    bearer of burdens shall bear another’s burden”
[Faatir 
    35:18]
So if you 
    conceal what you did, and your brother also conceals what he did – which is 
    what you both must do – then the relationship between your children will be 
    very normal and there will be no problems, either from the shar’i or social 
    point of view. 
With regard 
    to repentance from sin and seeking forgiveness for it, there are conditions 
    attached, which are discussed in question no.
