37031,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/37031,Is ghusl required if intercourse takes place with a barrier?,"If intercourse takes place with a barrier, alike some of the things that are used nowadays (condoms), is ghusl required?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.If there is emission of 
    semen, then ghusl is required because of ejaculation, because the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Water is for water.” 
    Narrated by Muslim, 343.

     But if there is no emission of semen, the scholars differed 
    concerning this matter and there are three opinions: 

    1 – That ghusl is required of both the man and the woman, 
    regardless of whether the barrier is thick or thin. This is the view of 
    al-Shaafa’i (may Allaah have mercy on him). 

    Al-Nawawi said: 

    If he wraps a piece of cloth around his penis and inserts it 
    until the tip disappears, but does not ejaculate, the correct view is that 
    ghusl is required of both of them, because the rulings have to do with 
    penetration, and this has taken place. End quote. 

    Al-Majmoo’, 2/150 

    2 – That ghusl is not required at all. This is the view of 
    the Hanbalis, as stated in al-Insaaf (2/92), because the two parts 
    have not met due to the presence of the barrier. 

    3 – That if the barrier is so thin that heat and pleasure can 
    be felt, then ghusl is required, otherwise it is not. This is the view of 
    the Maalikis as stated in al-Mawsoo’ah, 11/201. 
Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said 
    concerning this third opinion: This is the most likely to be correct, but to 
    be on the safe side ghusl should be done. End quote.

37039,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/37039,A sheep whose fatty tail has been cut off is not fit to be offered as a sacrifice,"If a sheep’s fatty tail is cut off when it is small for the purpose of making its body grow more fat, is it fit to be offered as a sacrifice (udhiyah) or slaughtered for the ‘aqeeqah?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.A sheep whose fatty tail has been cut off is not fit to be offered as a hadiy, udhiyah or ‘aqeeqah, because of the report narrated by Ameer al-Mu’mineen ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded us to check the eyes and the ears, and not to sacrifice any sheep that was one-eyed or whose ears had been cut and some of it left hanging, or any whose ears had been cut from the back, or any whose ears had been torn or split.” 
Narrated by Ahmad, 2/210, no. 851, and by the four. Classed as saheeh by al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Hibbaan. 
This applies if it has been cut, but if the lamb was born without a tail in the first place, then it comes under the ruling of one that is created without horns and one that has a small tail. The ruling is that these animals are good enough for sacrifice.

37055,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/37055,It is not valid to set conditions some time after entering ihraam,"I forgot to make a condition when entering ihraam by saying, “If I am prevented (from completing Hajj), then my exiting ihraam will at the point where I am prevented.” I remembered it when I was entering Makkah and I said it then. Is this condition valid?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.That is not valid because the condition should be made when entering ihraam, not after that, 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz was asked about making the condition some time after entering ihraam. He said: 
He may not do that, rather that should be said at the time of entering ihraam. What is meant by entering ihraam is when one forms the intention in one's heart to do so.
