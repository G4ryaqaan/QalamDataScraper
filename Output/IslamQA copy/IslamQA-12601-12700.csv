Missing the prayer for a valid excuse","Praise be to Allah.How to catch up with Friday prayer
You can only catch up with the Jumu`ah prayer if you catch a Rak`ah with the Imam, and catching a Rak`ah means catching up with the Ruku` with the Imam.
If you catch up with the Imam before he stands up from Ruku` in the second Rak`ah, then you have caught up with the prayer, and you should then complete your prayer after the Imam says the Salam. You should stand up and complete the remaining Rak`ah of your prayer. 
However, if you catch up with the Imam after he has stood up from Ruku`, this means that you have missed the Jumu`ah prayer, and have not caught up with it. In this case you have to pray it as Zuhr. You should stand up after the Imam has said the Salam and complete your prayer with four Rak`ahs, because it is Zuhr and not Jumu`ah. 
This is the view of the majority of scholars, Malik, Al-Shafi`i and Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on them). (See Al-Majmu’ by Al-Nawawi, 4/558)
They quoted several texts as evidence, such as: 

The words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Whoever catches up with one Rak`ah of the prayer has caught up with the prayer.” (Al-Bukhari, 580; Muslim, 607). 
The report narrated by Al-Nasa’i from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Whoever catches up with one Rak`ah of Jumu`ah or any other prayer, let him add more Rak`ahs to it to complete his prayer.’” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Al-Irwa’, 622). 

Missing the prayer for a valid excuse
If a person does not catch up with the prayer for a reason that is beyond his control, such as the bus breaking down, as mentioned in the question, or other excuses such as oversleeping or forgetting, then there is no sin on him in that case, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And there is no sin on you concerning that in which you made a mistake, except in regard to what your hearts deliberately intend” [Al-Ahzab 33:5]
A person in such cases does not deliberately intend to miss the prayer . 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has forgiven my Ummah for what they forget and what they do by mistake, and for what they are forced to do.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Al-Irwa’, 82) 
In this case, if one is sincere in his resolve to pray, but has an excuse, he will earn the reward in full, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Actions are (recompensed) by intentions, and every person will have but that which he intended.” (Al-Bukhari, 1; Muslim, 1907) 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) also said to his companions on the way back from the battle of Tabuk: “In Madinah there are men who, whenever you cover a distance or cross a valley, they share the reward with you; they have been detained by sickness.” (Muslim, 1911)

12602,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12602,Meaning of Imsak and Its Time,"In some countries there is a time approximately ten minutes before Fajr which they say is the time of imsak (stopping eating and drinking), when the people usually start fasting and stop eating and drinking. Is what they do correct?",Imsak means to stop eating and drinking when the dawn comes. Stopping eating and drinking ten minutes before Fajr is not correct.,,"Praise be to Allah.Imsak means to stop eating and drinking when the dawn comes. If some people in some countries stop eating and drinking ten minutes before Fajr, this is not correct. 
Allah has permitted the fasting person to eat and drink until dawn comes . Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and eat and drink until the white thread (light) of dawn appears to you distinct from the black thread (darkness of night).” [al-Baqarah 2:187]
Al-Bukhari (1919) and Muslim (1092) narrated from Ibn ‘Umar and ‘Aishah that Bilal used to give the adhan at night. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Eat and drink until Ibn Umm Maktum gives the adhan, for he does not give the adhan until dawn comes.” 
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“This shows that it is permissible to eat, drink, have intercourse , etc. until dawn comes.” 
Al-Hafiz ibn Hajar said in Fath al-Bari (4/199): 
“One of the reprehensible innovations that have appeared in our times is giving the second adhan approximately twenty minutes before Fajr in Ramadan, and extinguishing the lamps which indicate that it is haraam to eat and drink for those who want to fast. Those who introduced this innovation claim that they are erring on the side of caution with regard to an act of worship.” 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin was asked about some timetables which give the time of imsak as being approximately one-quarter of an hour before Fajr. He said: 
“This is a kind of bid’ah (innovation) which has no basis in the Sunnah. Rather the Sunnah is to do the opposite, because Allah says in His Noble Book (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and eat and drink until the white thread (light) of dawn appears to you distinct from the black thread (darkness of night).” [al-Baqarah 2:187]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Bilaal gives the adhan at night, so eat and drink until you hear the adhan of Ibn Umm Maktum , for he does not give the adhan until dawn comes.” 
This imsak which some of the people do is an addition to that which Allah has enjoined, so it is false. It is a kind of extremism in religion, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Those who go to extremes are doomed, those who go to extremes are doomed, those who go to extremes are doomed.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2670)
And Allah knows best.",Islam Q&A
12603,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12603,Seeking knowledge in order to teach people and not for the purpose of showing off,"If a person learns one of the branches of religious knowledge in order to play his role in the village where he lives, and he memorizes Qur’aan in order to lead the young men in praying at night in Ramadaan, will that be a kind of minor shirk (al-shirk al-asghar)?",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is known from the evidence of sharee’ah that seeking knowledge 
          and seeking to understand the religion is one of the best acts of worship 
          and obedience. The same is true of studying the Qur’aan and trying to 
          recite it a lot and to memorize it or as much as one can. All of these 
          are among the best acts of worship. If you do what you should of teaching 
          the people of your village, guiding them, leading them – the young men 
          and others – in prayer, all of these are good deeds which will be appreciated 
          and for which you will be rewarded. This is not showing off and it is 
          not shirk, if your 
          aim is to seek the pleasure of Allaah and the Hereafter, and you are 
          not doing it to show off to people and earn their praise, but to help 
          them and increase their knowledge and understanding of their religion. 
          That could be minor shirk 
          only if you did it to show off to people or to earn their praise. The 
          Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
          Allaah be upon him) said, “The thing that I fear most for you is minor 
          shirk.” He was asked 
          what that was, and he said, “Showing off.” “When a man stands up to 
          pray and he makes his prayer beautiful because he thinks that the people 
          are looking at him.” On the Day of Resurrection, Allaah will say to 
          those who show off, “Go to those for whom you used to show off in the 
          world, and see whether you find any reward with them.” Showing off means 
          that you do something with the aim of people seeing you and praising 
          you; reputation is a part of that. For example, if you read Qur’aan 
          so that people will praise you and say, “He is a good reader” or “He 
          reads well”; or you do a lot of dhikr 
          so that they will praise you and say, “He does a lot of dhikr”; 
          or you enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil so that people will 
          praise you. This is showing off, and this is minor shirk. 
          It is essential to beware of that and to do what you do for the sake 
          of Allaah alone, not for the sake of showing off to people and earning 
          their praise. But you should learn in order to act upon that knowledge 
          and to teach your brothers and lead them in prayer, and hope for the 
          reward that is with Allaah. You should do that with the aim of helping 
          them, not for the purposes of showing off or enhancing your reputation. 
          If you read from the Mus-haf 
          there is nothing wrong with that if you lead your brothers in prayer 
          reading from the Mus-haf 
          in Ramadaan. The freed slave of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with 
          her) used to lead her in prayer reading from the Mus-haf. 
          So it is OK to read from the Mus-haf 
          when praying at night in Ramadaan if you have not memorized it, but 
          if one has learned it by heart and can recite it from memory, that is 
          better, but there is nothing wrong with reading from the Mus-haf 
          if necessary.","Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah li Samaahat al-Shaykh al-‘Allaamah ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz, may Allaah have mercy on him, vol. 9, p. 3"

12612,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12612,A woman has to cover her body when praying even when she is behind her husband,Does my wife have to wear hijab in prayer when it is just her and I in prayer alone,,,"Praise be to Allah.When a woman is praying, even if she is with her husband, her situation is different than at other times. Covering the ‘awrah is one of the conditions of the prayer being valid, for both men and women. Her prayer cannot be valid otherwise. It was narrated in a saheeh report from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah does not accept the prayer of a woman of child-bearing age unless (she covers herself) with a khimaar.” (Narrated by Abu Dawood, al-Salaah, 546; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan Abi Dawood, 596). What this means is that the prayer of an adult woman is not valid (if she does not cover herself), because if something is not accepted, it is not valid. 
Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah] said: If a woman is praying alone, she is commanded to cover herself… so the person who is praying covers during the prayer things which he or she is allowed to leave uncovered outside of prayer.
(See Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, vol. 22, p. 109) 
On this basis, a woman is required to cover all of her body during prayer apart from the face and hands. See question no. 1046 concerning the woman’s ‘awrah  which she has to cover during prayer.

12615,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12615,Discussion with a Christian about the Crucifixion,Why is it so difficult for the Muslims to believe that Christ was crucified to erase our sins? Why do they reject the idea of the Crucifixion altogether?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.There is nothing strange about the Muslims rejecting this idea, because the Quran in which they believe and accept what it tells them definitively states that that did not happen, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And because of their saying (in boast), ‘We killed Messiah ‘Eesa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), the Messenger of Allah,’ — but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but it appeared so to them the resemblance of ‘Eesa (Jesus) was put over another man (and they killed that man)], and those who differ therein are full of doubts. They have no (certain) knowledge, they follow nothing but conjecture. For surely; they killed him not [i.e. ‘Eesa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary)]”
[al-Nisa’ 4:157]
Rather the problem rests with the Christians for whom the doctrine of the crucifixion and redemption has become a central issue, so much so that the cross is the symbol of their religion. 
It is strange that they differ concerning the form of this cross which indicates their confusion about this fabrication. 
There are differences between their Gospels and their historians regarding everything that has to do with the story of the crucifixion. 
They differ concerning the timing of the Last Supper, which according to them was one of the events in the lead-up to the crucifixion. They differ concerning the traitor who led (the Romans) to Christ – did that happen at least one day before the Last Supper, as narrated by Luke, or during it, after Christ gave him the piece of bread, as narrated by John? 
Was Christ the one who carried his cross, as John says, as was customary with one who was going to be crucified, according to Nottingham, or was it Simon of Cyrene, as the other three Gospels state?
 They say that two thieves were crucified alongside Christ, one on his right and one on his left, so what was the attitude of these two towards the Messiah who was being crucified, as they claim? 
Did the thieves scorn him for being crucified, and say that his Lord had abandoned him and left him to his enemies? Or did only one of them scorn him, and did the other rebuke the one who scorned him?  
At what hour did this crucifixion take place – was it in the third hour, as Mark says, or in the sixth as John says? 
What happened after the so-called crucifixion?  
Mark says that the veil of the Temple was torn from top to bottom. Matthew adds that the earth shook and rocks crumbled, and many of the saints rose from their graves and entered the holy city, appearing to many. Luke says that the sun turned dark, and the veil of the Temple was torn in the middle, and when the centurion saw what had happened, he glorified God and said, “Truly this man was righteous.” 
But John does not know anything about all that! 
These are not the only weak elements and indications of falseness in the story of the crucifixion, as narrated in the gospels. Rather the one who studies the details of the gospel narratives of this story will, with the least effort, notice the great differences in the details of this story, which are such that it is impossible to believe it all or even any part of it! 
How desperate are the failed attempts to fill this gap and conceal the faults of this distorted book. Allah indeed spoke the truth when He said in His Book which He has preserved (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Do they not then consider the Quran carefully? Had it been from other than Allah, they would surely, have found therein many a contradiction” [Al-Nisa’ 4:82]
Apart from the fact that the gospel accounts are not sound, and their authors themselves admit that they were not revealed to the Messiah in this form, nor were they even written during his lifetime, none of the witnesses were present at the events to which they testify, as Mark says:  
“Then everyone deserted him and fled.”
Mark 14:50 – New International Version (NIV)
Because these events were not witnessed by anyone who narrated them, there is a great deal of room for imagination and poetic licence. 
We will complete our discussion of the fable of the crucifixion of Christ (peace be upon him) by looking at what the Gospels say about the Messiah’s prediction that he would be saved from death: 
On one occasion the Pharisees and chief priests sent the guards to arrest him and he said to them: 
“I am with you for only a short time, and then I go to the one who sent me. You will look for me, but you will not find me, and where I am, you cannot come.”
John 7:33-34 – NIV
Elsewhere he says: 
“Once more Jesus said to them, ‘I am going away, and you will look for me, and you will die in your sin. Where I go, you cannot come.’
This made the Jews ask, ‘Will he kill himself? Is that why he says, “Where I go, you cannot come”?’
But he continued, ‘You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.
I told you that you would die in your sins; if you do not believe that I am the one I claim to be, you will indeed die in your sins.’
‘Who are you?’ they asked.
‘Just what I have been claiming all along,’ Jesus replied. ‘I have much to say in judgment of you. But he who sent me is reliable, and what I have heard from him I tell the world.’
They did not understand that he was telling them about his Father.
So Jesus said, ‘When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am the one I claim to be and that I do nothing on my own but speak just what the Father has taught me.
The one who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, for I always do what pleases him.’”
John 8:21-29 – NIV
Then at the end he tells them again: 
“For I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.'”
Matthew 23:39 – NIV, also Luke 13:35
The Messiah, as these texts and others show, was certain that God would never hand him over to his enemies, and would never forsake him. 
“But a time is coming, and has come, when you will be scattered, each to his own home. You will leave me all alone. Yet I am not alone, for my Father is with me.
I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.”
John 16:32-33
Because of that the passers by, and indeed everyone who attended the so-called crucifixion, mocked the Messiah, as the writer of this Gospel says (although that could not have been true): 
“Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads
and saying, ‘You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!’
In the same way the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders mocked him.
‘He saved others,’ they said, ‘but he can't save himself! He's the King of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him.
He trusts in God. Let God rescue him now if he wants him, for he said, “I am the Son of God.”’
In the same way the robbers who were crucified with him also heaped insults on him.”
Matthew 27:39-44 – NIV
But it seems that Jesus’ certainty that God was with him began to waver, according to the distorted Gospel narrative, (although that could not have been true): 
“Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, ‘Sit here while I go over there and pray.’
He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him, and he began to be sorrowful and troubled.
Then he said to them, ‘My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me.’
Going a little farther, he fell with his face to the ground and prayed, ‘My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will.’
Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping.
 
…
He went away a second time and prayed, ‘My Father, if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away unless I drink it, may your will be done.’
When he came back, he again found them sleeping, …
So he left them and went away once more and prayed the third time, sayingthe same thing.
Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, ‘Are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour is near, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners’”
Matthew 26:36-45 – NIV
Luke describes the scene and says: 
“And being in anguish, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground.
When he rose from prayer and went back to the disciples, he found them asleep, exhausted from sorrow.
‘Why are you sleeping?’ he asked them. ‘Get up and pray so that you will not fall into temptation.’”
Luke 22:44-46 – NIV
Because of this mockery of the message of Christ – according to their claims – and because Christ thought that God was with him and would never forsake him, then it follows that the writer who fabricated this dramatic scene would end it with a vision of the despair of the Messiah and his feelings of being abandoned by God – exalted be Allah far above what the wrongdoers say. The fabricator says: 
“From the sixth hour until the ninth hour darkness came over all the land.
About the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, ‘Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?’--which means, ""My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?""
Matthew 27:38-47 – NIV
See also Mark 15:34
If we understand what this story means when subjected to criticism, the same will apply to the doctrine of redemption and sacrifice that is based on it.

Your Muslim boyfriend should not have a girlfriend. If he wants to marry you, that is o.k. even if you are not Muslim, but on the condition that you are one of the People of the Book, i.e., Jewish or Christian. We ask Allaah to guide you to Islam and to help you to embrace it, and you will feel happy and it will change your life for the better, in sha Allaah (if Allaah wills). 
Secondly: 
It is not essential for your child to have an Islamic name, although it is preferable. But it should not be a name that has an ugly or offensive meaning, or a name which is distinctively the name of a kaafir (disbeliever), such as ‘Abd al-Maseeh (meaning “slave of the Messiah” – a name that is common among Arab Christians). 
For us, names have great significance. 
Ibn al-Qayyim – one of the greatest Muslim scholars – said: 
Because names carry meanings, it makes sense that there should be a connection between the name and the meaning, and that the meaning should not be like a total stranger with no connection to the name. Rather names have an impact on the things named, and the things named are affected by their names, whether they are beautiful or ugly, light or heavy, soft or rough. 
Zaad al-Ma’aad, 2/336. 
So long as your child will be a Muslim – as will you, in sha Allaah – we hope that you will not make him an object of mockery to others or make him stand out because of his having a name that is different from the names of other Muslims. 
As the child has not yet been born, you still have the opportunity to choose a good name for him, because it may be difficult to change it after he grows up. 
Thirdly: 
You could choose some good names for boys and girls from a book by Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd entitled Tasmiyat al-Mawlood. Please also see question no. 7180.

12625,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12625,Using the word “Sayyid”,"We often use the word “Sayyid” when addressing one another, for people whose ancestry can be traced to a particular family. Is it OK to do this?  
[Translator’s note: the word “Sayyid” literally means “master”; it is used as a title of respect for descendants of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and others; it is sometimes used as an equivalent of the English “Mister” or “Sir”]",,,"Praise be to Allah.If a person is known by this title, there is nothing wrong with that, because the word “Sayyid” may be used for the leader of a people, or for a faqeeh or scholar, or for those who are descended from Faatimah through the children of al-Hasan and al-Husayn. All of these are forms of address which are well known among the people. The Arabs used to call tribal leaders and elders “Sayyid” (e.g. Sayyid Bani Foolaan – the leader of such-and-such tribe, etc). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used this word, when he asked some of the Arabs, “Who is your leader (sayyid), O Banu So-and-so? Who is your leader (sayyid), O Banu So-and-so?”, i.e., who is your chief? And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said concerning al-Hasan, “This son of mine is a sayyid and perhaps Allaah will reconcile two great groups of Muslims through him.” It is disliked (makrooh) to address a person as Ya sayyidi (O my master) or Yaa sayyidanaa (O our master), because when it was said to the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “You are our master,” he said, “The Master is Allaah, may He blessed and exalted”; and because this may make him conceited and proud. So we should not do that. Instead we should say, “O So and so” or “So Abu (father of) So and so,” using the names, kunyas (Abu So and so, etc.) and nicknames which are known. 
With regard to using the phrases “Yaa Sayyidi” and “Yaa Sayyidanaa” when addressing one another, it is better not to do that. 
Saying “Sayyid” to a munaafiq or kaafir is not permissible, because of the hadeeth, “Do not say ‘Sayyidanaa’ to a munaafiq, because if he is really your master then you have angered your Lord.” (Narrated by Ahmad, Abu Dawood and al-Nasaa’i; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, no. 7405, p. 1234)

Is this permissible according  to sharee’ah? Does reciting over oil or water come under the same ruling as reciting over the patient himself for the purpose of treatment?",,,"Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with taking payment for treating the sick by 
          means of ruqyah, because 
          it was reported in al-Saheehayn

          to a tribe among the Arabs who did not offer them hospitality. Their 
          chief was stung, and they did everything but to no avail. Then they 
          came to that group of Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) and 
          said, “Is there any raaqi 
          (one who does ruqyah) 
          among you? For our chief have been stung.” They said, “Yes, but you 
          did not offer us hospitality, so we will not do ruqyah 
          for him unless we make a deal.” So they agreed upon a number of sheep, 
          then one of the Sahaabah did ruqyah 
          for him by reciting Soorat al-Faatihah, 
          and he recovered. They gave them what had been agreed upon, then the 
          Sahaabah said to one another, “Let us not do anything until we tell

          it and he said, “You did the right thing.” There is nothing wrong with 
          reciting into water or oil to treat the sick, the one who is affected 
          by sihr (witchcraft) or 
          the insane, but reciting over the sick person and blowing onto him is 
          better and is preferable. Abu Dawood (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
          narrated with a hasan isnaad 
          that the Prophet  (peace and blessings

          as it does not involve shirk.” 
          This saheeh hadeeth includes the sick person doing ruqyah

Jesus is the only son of the Lord and that is the truth!!,,,"Praise be to Allah.Thank you for giving us the opportunity to communicate and discuss the truth which we all need to know and follow, no matter what our previous differences of opinion and beliefs. It is only by means of this, I mean by knowing the truth and following it, that we can free ourselves of our sins, as it says in your Bible: 
“Then you will know the truth and the truth will set you free”
John 8:31 – New International Version (NIV) 
So let us pause for a while and think about this truth, as it is stated in your Bible despite all the distortions and changes that have happened to it!
The message that was brought by the Messiah (peace be upon him) was the call to worship God, the One, the Lord of the Messiah and the Lord of the worlds: 
“Now this is eternal life: that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent”
John 17:3 – NIV 
“A certain ruler asked him: ‘Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?’
‘Why do you call me good?’ Jesus answered. ‘No one is good – except God alone.’”
Luke 18:18-19 – NIV 
“The devil led him up to a high place and showed him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world.
And he said to him, ‘I will give you all their authority and splendour, for it has been given to me, and I can give it to anyone I want to.
So if you worship me, it will all be yours.’
Jesus answered, ‘It is written: “Worship the Lord your God and serve him only.”’”
Luke 4:5-8 – NIV 
Believing in and worshipping Allah alone, besides Whom there is no other god, is the greatest teaching brought by the Messiah, and it is the greatest teaching brought by all the Prophets. 
“One of the teachers of the law came and noticed them debating. Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, ‘Of all the commandments, which is the most important?’
‘The most important one,’ answered Jesus, ‘is this: “Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.
Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.”
The second is this: “Love your neighbour as yourself.” There is no commandment greater than these.’
‘Well said, teacher,’ the man replied. ‘You are right in saying that God is one and there is no other but him.
To love him with all your heart, with all your understanding and with all your strength, and to love your neighbour as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.’
When Jesus saw that he has answered wisely, he said to him, ‘You are not far from the kingdom of God.’ And from then on no one dared ask him any more questions.”
Mark 12:28-34 – NIV 
But do not think that this advice was given to Israel or to his own people only. Rather this is the basis of the teachings of all the Prophets. The same advice appears in the Gospel of Matthew, in similar wording, after which he says: 
“All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.”
Matthew 22:39 – NIV  
This belief in the oneness of God is indeed the message of all of the Prophets. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And We did not send any Messenger before you (O Muhammad) but We revealed to him (saying): Laa ilaaha illa Ana [none has the right to be worshipped but I (Allah)], so worship Me (Alone and none else)”
[al-Anbiya’ 21:25]
This is the basic message to which the Messiah called people and warned them against differing from that. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Surely, they have disbelieved who say: ‘Allah is the Messiah [‘Eesa (Jesus)], son of Maryam (Mary).’ But the Messiah [‘Eesa (Jesus)] said: ‘O Children of Israel! Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.’ Verily, whosoever sets up partners (in worship) with Allah, then Allah has forbidden Paradise to him, and the Fire will be his abode. And for the Zaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers) there are no helpers”
[al-Maa'idah 5:72]
This is the basic principle on which we should all agree. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say (O Muhammad): ‘O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians): Come to a word that is just between us and you, that we worship none but Allah (Alone), and that we associate no partners with Him, and that none of us shall take others as lords besides Allah.’ Then, if they turn away, say: ‘Bear witness that we are Muslims’”
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:64] 
It is alien to true Christianity, this futile attempt to reconcile the belief in the Oneness of God, which is the message brought by the Prophets, and which is clearly stated in their Bible, and affirmed in the Torah in particular, with their belief in the trinity. 
It says in the American Encyclopedia: 
The belief in the Oneness of God – as a theological movement – began at a very early stage in history, and in fact it preceded the belief in trinity by many decades. Christianity developed from Judaism, and Judaism firmly believes that there is one God. 
The path that led from Jerusalem (the home of the first disciples of Christ) to Nicea (where it was decided in 325 CE that Christ was equal to God in essence and eternal nature) can hardly be described as a straight path.
The doctrine of trinity which was affirmed in the fourth century CE bears no resemblance to the original teachings of Christ concerning the nature of God. Au contraire, it is the opposite, a deviation from that teaching. Hence it developed in opposition to the belief in One God… (27/294). 
You can refer to the views of some of those Christians who still believe in the Oneness of God in the same American Encyclopedia, 27/300-301 
It is difficult to comprehend, so no wonder you were never able to comprehend it. But what is strange is that you believe in something that is impossible to understand, unless we deceive ourselves and say that this understanding will come on the Last Day: 
“We understand that as much as our minds are able to, and we hope that we will understand it more clearly in the future, when the veil is removed from all things in heaven and on earth. But for now, the extent to which we do understand it is enough!” 
Yes, the truth will become perfectly clear to you in the future, as it is clear to us today, praise be to Allah, on the Day on which Allah will gather the Messengers and make them bear witness concerning their nations. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And (remember) when Allah will say (on the Day of Resurrection): ‘O ‘Eesa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary)! Did you say unto men: Worship me and my mother as two gods besides Allah?’  He will say: ‘Glory be to You! It was not for me to say what I had no right (to say). Had I said such a thing, You would surely have known it. You know what is in my inner‑self though I do not know what is in Yours; truly, You, only You, are the All‑Knower of all that is hidden (and unseen).
‘Never did I say to them aught except what You (Allah) did command me to say: Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord. And I was a witness over them while I dwelt amongst them, but when You took me up, You were the Watcher over them; and You are a Witness to all things. (This is a great admonition and warning to the Christians of the whole world).
‘If You punish them, they are Your slaves, and if You forgive them, verily, You, only You, are the All‑Mighty, the All‑Wise.’
Allah will say: This is a Day on which the truthful will profit from their truth: theirs are Gardens under which rivers flow (in Paradise) — they shall abide therein forever. Allah is pleased with them and they with Him. That is the great success (Paradise).

The point is that age should not be a problem and such a marriage is not wrong if the man is righteous and the woman is righteous. May Allaah guide us all to the best way.

12631,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12631,Is Hypnosis Haram?,"As Muslims, are we allowed to use hypnosis (hypnotherapy)? It claims to help
people in many ways e.g. eliminating peoples’ fears, phobias as well as instilling
confidence in people about general life?","Hypnosis is haram because it uses the help of the jinn and it implies turning to someone other than Allah. For more, see the detailed answer.",,"Praise be to Allah.Our contemporary scholars have ruled that the issue of hypnosis (hypnotherapy) has something to do with using the help of the jinn , and based on that we must note the following two points: 
1– It is not permissible to seek the help of the jinn or any other creatures in trying to find out matters of the unseen, whether that is by calling upon them, trying to please them or any other method. Rather that is shirk because this is a kind of worship, and Allah has taught His slaves to worship Him ِlone and say, “You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything)” [al-Fatihah 1:5 – interpretation of the meaning]. 
It was proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to Ibn 'Abbas: “If you ask, then ask of Allah, and if you seek help, then seek help from Allah.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2516) 
2– Hypnosis is a kind of fortune-telling or magic whereby the hypnotist uses the jinn to overpower the subject and then speak through his tongue and give him strength to do things by means of controlling his faculties. 
This is if the jinni is sincere towards the hypnotist and obeys him in return for the things by means of which the hypnotist draws close to him. So the jinni makes the subject obey the wishes of the hypnotist to do things or tell him things, through the help of the jinni. 
Thus using hypnosis as a means of finding out where stolen goods are hidden, or where a lost item is, or as a means of treating disease or of doing anything else is not permissible. Rather it is shirk, for the reasons stated above, and because it implies turning to someone other than Allah and goes beyond the ordinary means which Allah has created for His creatures and permitted them to use.

    Allaah or in anything that will adversely affect you, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Obedience is 
    only with regard to what is right and proper,” and “There is no obedience to any created being if it involves disobedience towards the Creator.” 
    The person who tells you not to be friends with good people is not to be obeyed, whether they are your parents or anyone else. You should not obey 
    anyone who tells you to be friends with bad people either. But you should speak to your parents in a good manner and in a way that is better, such 
    as saying “These are good people, I benefit a lot from them, I am fond of them and I am learning a lot from them.” You should respond to them with

      There can be no doubt that the call to believe in Allaah 
      alone (Tawheed) and to worship Him alone to the exclusion of anyone else, 
      is the basic message that was brought by the Prophet of Allaah ‘Eesa 
      (peace be upon him), as it was the basic message brought by all the 
      Prophets. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And verily, We have sent 
    among every Ummah (community, nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): ‘Worship 
    Allaah (Alone), and avoid (or keep away from) Taghoot (all false deities, 
    i.e. do not worship Taghoot besides Allaah).’ Then of them were some whom 
    Allaah guided and of them were some upon whom the straying was justified. So

    be worshipped but I (Allaah)], so worship Me (Alone and none else)”

    [al-Anbiya’ 21:25]

    ‘Eesa will bear witness to this call against his people, as 
    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):

    “And (remember) when Allaah will 
    say (on the Day of Resurrection): 'O ‘Eesa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary)! 
    Did you say unto men: “Worship me and my mother as two gods besides

    up, You were the Watcher over them; and You are a Witness to all things’”

    With regard to how the followers of this religion deviated 
    after that from pure Tawheed to idolatrous beliefs and the worship of Jesus 
    and his mother besides God, this is something which happened early on in 
    Christian history. We will quote here some evidence to that effect from 
    their own people’s words. Let whoever has ears listen. 

    It says in the American Encyclopedia: 

    The belief in the Oneness of God – as a theological movement

    Will Durant says: 

    When Christianity conquered Rome, the new religion (i.e., 
    Christianity) was infused with the blood of the old idolatrous religion: the 
    title of archbishop, worship for the great mother, and an innumerable number 
    of lords who gave peace of mind and were like who exist in all places and 
    cannot be detected with the senses. All of this came into Christianity as 
    the blood of the mother comes into her child. 

    The civilized empire handed over power and administration to 
    the papacy and the impact of the word replaced the impact of the sword. The 
    preachers of the church started to assume positions of power. 

    Christianity did not put an end to idolatry, rather it 
    reinforced it. The Greek mind came back to life in a new form, in the 
    doctrines and rituals of the church. The Greek rituals appeared in the 
    rituals of the monastic saints. From Egypt came the idea of the holy 
    trinity, the day of reckoning, eternal reward and punishment, and man’s 
    eternal life in one of the other. From Egypt also came the worship of the 
    mother and child, the mystical union with God, the union which led to 
    Platonism and agnosticism, and the erasing of Christian doctrine. And from 
    Persia came the belief in the return of the Messiah and his ruling the earth 
    for 1000 years. 

    Qissat al-Hadaarah, 11/418 (The 
    Story of Civilization) 

    Despite the element of atheism in the words of Durant, which 
    is something that he is known for, and which is apparent in his claim that 
    the idea of eternal reward or punishment came from the Egyptians, tracing 
    the origins of deviant idolatry in Christianity is no longer a secret, and 
    he is not the only one who has researched them. In his book Christianity 
    and Idolatry, Robertson states that Mithraism, which is a religion of 
    Persian origin, flourished in Persia approximately six centuries before the 
    birth of Christ, and it reached Rome around the year 70 CE, where it spread 
    throughout the Roman lands. Then it reached Britain and spread to a number 
    of British cities. What concerns us here about this religion is that it 
    says: 

    -That Mithras, after whom it is 
    named, was an intermediary between God and man (for a similar doctrine in 
    Christianity, see Acts 4:12).

    -He was born in a cave or in a 
    corner of the earth (cf. Luke 2:8)

    -His birthday was December 25 
    (which is the day celebrated by the Christians as the day when Jesus was 
    born)

    -He had twelve disciples (cf. 
    Matthew 10:1)

    -He died to save the world (cf. 
    I Corinthians 15:3)

    -He was buried but he came back 
    to life (cf. I Corinthians 15:4)

    -He ascended to heaven in front 
    of his disciples (cf. Acts 1:9)

    -He was called “Saviour” (cf. 
    Titus 2:13)

    -Among his attributes is that he 
    is like a peaceful lamb (cf. John 1:29)

    -The “Divine supper” was held in 
    his memory every year (cf. I Corinthians 11:23-25)

    -One of his symbols was baptism
    

    -Sunday was sacred to them

    The French Orientalist Leon Joteh, in his book “An 
    Introduction to Islamic philosophy” is of the view that the origin of 
    the Christian trinity is to be found in Greek philosophy, specifically in 
    the ideas of modern Platonism, which took the basis of the idea of trinity 
    as a view of the Creator of the universe from Plato, then developed it to a 
    great extent, so that the resemblance between this idea and Christianity 
    became greater. So (in their view) the Creator, the One Who is absolutely 
    perfect, appointed two intermediaries between him and mankind, who emanated 
    from Him, and were also part of Him at the same time, meaning that they are 
    contained in His essence. These two entities are reasoning and divine 
    spirit. Then he said: 

    The marriage of Jewish belief and Greek philosophy did not 
    only produce philosophy, rather it produced a religion too, namely 
    Christianity which imbibed many ideas from the Greeks. The Christian concept 
    of divinity is taken from the same source as modern Platonism. Hence you see 
    many similarities between the two, although they may vary in some details. 
    They are both based on a belief in trinity, in which the three “persons” are 
    one.  

    This is what the American writer Draper refers to: 

    Idolatry and polytheism entered Christianity through the 
    influence of the hypocrites who occupied positions of influence and high 
    positions in the Roman state by pretending to be Christians, but they never 
    cared about religion and were not sincere at all. Similarly Constantine had 
    spent his life in darkness and evil, and he did not follow the commands of 
    the church except for a short while at the end of his life. (p. 337) 

    Although the followers of Christianity gained some power, to 
    the extent that they managed to have Constantine appointed as ruler, they 
    failed to eradicate idolatry completely. As a result of their struggle, 
    their principles became fused with idolatry, from which point there 
    developed a new religion in which Christianity and idolatry were manifested 
    equally. 

    Thus the Christians followed the same path of those 
    disbelievers who had come before them, step by step, as their own Book 
    testifies. And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And the Jews say: ‘Uzayr 
    (Ezra) is the son of Allaah, and the Christians say: Messiah is the son of 
    Allaah. That is their saying with their mouths, resembling the saying of 
    those who disbelieved aforetime. Allaah’s Curse be on them, how they are 
    deluded away from the truth!”

      We may be repeating ourselves here if we point out that the 
      Gospels, or the Bible, of which we are speaking, that is extant among the 
      people nowadays, is something other than that which was revealed from 
      Allaah to His slave and Messenger ‘Eesa ibn Maryam (Jesus son of Mary – 
      peace be upon him). With regard to what was revealed from Allaah, no one's 
      faith is valid if he disbelieves in it or in any part of it. We have 
      warned against that in question no.
      47516. 

    But for reasons of divine wisdom, that book continued to be 
    distorted and misinterpreted from ancient times until its divine origin was 
    lost and disappeared. All that the people have in their hands now is no more 
    than a mixture of the darkness of shirk and trinity with the glimmer of the 
    light of Tawheed, an accumulation of lies and distortions mixed with the 
    remnants of the truth and knowledge of the Prophets. 

    Now, after so many centuries of tampering, it is impossible 
    for anyone to be certain whether any part of the Bible is true or false, 
    unless it is checked in the light of the truth that confirms that which went 
    before, the divine light of which has not been extinguished by the darkness 
    of ignorance and whims and desires, and whose pure truthfulness has not been 
    contaminated with even a single lie or mistake. That can be nothing other 
    than the Holy Qur’aan which Allaah has guaranteed to preserve, as He says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, We, it is We Who 
    have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Qur’aan) and surely, We will guard it 
    (from corruption)”

    [al-Hijr 15:9]

    Even though one of the greatest Christian scholars and 
    defenders of the Bible, namely Norton, tried to defend the Bible against the 
    criticism of Ackharn the German, he was forced to admit that distinguishing 
    truth from lies nowadays is very difficult. 

    From this we reach the matter asked about in the question. We 
    say that whoever does not believe in the Qur’aan will never have any valid 
    book in which to believe, and whoever casts aspersions upon the truthfulness 
    of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the 
    validity of the Islamic religion, will not be able to offer any proof that 
    the religion which he follows is valid. 

    The point is that whoever casts aspersions upon the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the things that he said 
    about his Prophethood and the Revelation that he received from heaven, even 
    though miracles happened at his hands that confirmed the veracity of what he 
    said, and all his life he continued to challenge his enemies to produce the 
    like of the Book which he attributed to the revelation of his Lord, and even 
    challenged mankind and the jinn together to cooperate and produce something 
    like this Qur’aan, as Allaah said: 

    “Say: “If the mankind and the jinn were together to 
    produce the like of this Qur’aan, they could not produce the like thereof, 
    even if they helped one another”

    [al-Isra’ 17:88]
But they were not able 
    to do that and produce anything like it, throughout history and until now, 
    in spite of the numerous enemies who opposed him and wished that they could 
    prove that he was lying. But there is no way they can do that! 

    Moreover, the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) continued to prevail over his enemies and they were unable to 
    prove him wrong. They were never able to prove that he was lying in anything 
    he said, even in the regular kind of talk that people engage in amongst 
    themselves, let alone telling lies about his Lord Who had sent him.  

    I wonder, if they reject all that evidence, how they could 
    have any evidence of the soundness of the idea of “divine inspiration” which 
    forms the foundation of their belief in their books, in spite of the fact 
    that they do not claim that the Gospel was revealed to Jesus, or that he 
    wrote it or dictated it, or even that the Gospels were written during his 
    lifetime! 

    Moreover, there is no sound evidence concerning the 
    personalities of the four men who wrote the Gospels: who they were, how they 
    lived their lives, and whether what they wrote came from divine revelation 
    or divine inspiration, as they claim, or it was only their own ideas or what 
    was inspired to them by their devils. Horn, one of the greatest exegetes of 
    the Bible, says: “If it is said that the Bible was revealed from God, that 
    does not mean that every single word or phrase of it is inspired by God. 
    Rather we know from the statements of those who wrote the Bible, from the 
    differences in their styles, that they were permitted to write according to 
    their own natures, customs and understanding. It is unimaginable that they 
    could have been inspired in everything they described or in every ruling 
    they stated.” 

    The Encyclopaedia Britannica refers to the different 
    opinions among Christian scholars and researchers concerning the matter of 
    divine inspiration and whether every phrase of the Bible is divinely 
    inspired or not. Then it comments on that in one article (19/20) where it 
    says: “Those who say that every phrase is divinely inspired cannot prove 
    their claims with any ease.” 

    We say: and they cannot do so even with difficulty! 

    There are dozens of places where the Gospels contradict one 
    another, and dozens of historical errors and false prophecies that never 
    materialized. Frederick Grant stated that “The New Testament is not 
    homogeneous because it is a compilation of scattered elements. It does not 
    represent a single point of view or style from beginning to end, rather it 
    represents different points of view. 

    The American Encyclopaedia states that there is a 
    serious problem that results from the contradictions that appear in 
    different places throughout the fourth Gospel and the three synoptic 
    Gospels. The differences between them are so great that if you accept the 
    synoptic Gospels as sound and correct, this will lead to the conclusion that 
    the Gospel of John is not sound. 

    It is worth noting that the Gospel of John is the one which 
    focuses the most on their doctrine of trinity; indeed they admit that it was 
    written to establish this doctrine, which the other three Gospels failed to 
    do, and to put an end to the dispute concerning this matter. 

    The Catholic Church, which strongly adheres to the idea of 
    divine inspiration as the origin of the Bible, confirmed that in a meeting 
    of the Vatican in 1869-1870. But a century later it revised its opinion and 
    admitted, in Vatican II (1962-1965) that these books contain a great deal of 
    defects and some falsehoods, according to what was reported by the French 
    Catholic researcher Dr Maurice Bucaille, who later became a Muslim. 

    Moreover, if a person disbelieves in any of the miracles of 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or any aspects 
    of his life story that point to his truthfulness, how can he prove the 
    miracles of these so-called apostles who wrote the Gospels, or prove that 
    their claim to divine inspiration is correct? 

    For them, the idea of divine inspiration is correct on the 
    basis of what is written in the Bible, and the miracles mentioned therein, 
    and the Bible is sound and correct because it is divinely inspired! 

    Thus their evidence ends in a vicious circle, as was 
    mentioned in the Encyclopaedia by some researchers: “So the Bible is 
    sound because it is divinely inspired and their inspiration is proven 
    because the Bible testifies to that!” 

    If a person disbelieves in the Qur’aan, which was transmitted 
    by means of tawaatur (a process in which something is narrated from so many 
    by so many that it is inconceivable that they could all agree upon a lie), 
    throughout the Muslim world, east and west, generation after generation, by 
    memory and in writing, with no variant copies and no contradictions, how can 
    he prove the Gospels to be sound or rely on them, when there is no shred of 
    evidence, not even a hint, that they existed any earlier than two hundred 
    years after the death of Christ, according to what Norton quoted from 
    Ackharn the German? Then there were the calamities that befell the 
    Christians in the fourth century CE, when their churches were destroyed and 
    their books were burned, which makes one lose confidence in any of their 
    books that appeared after that. When did they appear and in whose possession 
    were they during that period of persecution and hiding? How did they reach 
    us?… There are many questions about this problem as was expressed in the 
    Encyclopaedia Britannica where it says: 

    “We have no certain knowledge of the way in which the 
    canonical soundness of these four Gospels was established, nor where or when 
    this decision was made.” 

    With regard to not knowing who translated it from the 
    language in which it was originally written, how reliable his knowledge was 
    and how qualified he was for this task, and how we can be certain that he 
    translated it in the proper manner, that is a whole other issue!

Please note that they are in their own country and are not travelling.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Yes, it is permissible for the mujaahideen to 
    break their fast in Ramadaan, so that they will have strength for jihad, even if they are in their own country, for fasting weakens their ability 
    to fight and deal with the enemy. 
This is one of the two opinions of Imam Ahmad 
    and was the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and his two students Ibn Muflih and Ibn al-Qayyim, and other scholars. See al-Furoo’ 
    by Ibn Muflih, 3/28 
There is evidence narrated from the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that indicates that it is prescribed to break one’s fast because of jihad. 
Muslim (1120) narrated that Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: We 
    traveled with the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to Makkah – meaning at the Conquest of Makkah – and we were 
    fasting. We stopped to camp and the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “You are approaching your enemy and 
    breaking the fast will make you stronger.” This was a concession, and some of us continued to fast and some of us broke our fast. Then we stopped 
    to camp again, and he said, “You are going to meet your enemy in the morning, and breaking the fast will make you stronger, so break your fast.” 
    So we had no choice but to break our fast. 
Abu Dawood (2365) narrated that one of the 
    companions of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: I saw the Messenger of Allaah (S) telling the people on a journey 
    in the year of the Conquest (of Makkah) to break their fast. He said, “Gain strength to face your enemy.” 
Al-Haafiz said in al-Talkhees al-Habeer: 
    this was classed as saheeh by al-Haakim and Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr 
These two hadeeths indicate that the command to break the fast was not because of travelling, 
    rather it was in order to gain strength for jihad. 
It says in al-Muntaqa Sharh Muwatta’ 
    al-Imam Maalik: 
The words “Gain strength to face your enemy” indicate that this was the reason breaking the 
    fast. If the reason was travelling then he would not have explained it as being in order to gain strength to face the enemy, rather he would have 
    said it was because of travelling. 
Al-Manaawi said in Fayd al-Qadeer: 
He said, “You are going to meet your enemy in the morning.” According to another version, “You 
    have come close to your enemy…” From the fact that he gave the reason as their approaching the enemy and their needing physical strength to meet 
    their enemy, it may be understood that in this case the fast was broken because of jihad, not because of travelling. If the enemy attacked them in 
    their own land [i.e., when they were not travelling] and they needed physical strength, then it would be permissible for them to break their fast, 
    based on what is said, because that is more necessary than breaking one's fast just because of travelling. 
Ibn al-Qayyim said in Zaad al-Ma’aad 
    (2/53-54): 
The Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) commanded them to break their fast when they got close to their enemy so that they would have the strength to fight them. If 
    such a situation happened when they were not travelling, and breaking their fast would make them stronger to face their enemy, would they be 
    allowed to break their fast? There are two opinions on this matter, the one which is based on the soundest evidence is that they are allowed to do 
    that. This is the view favoured by Ibn Taymiyah, and this is the view stated in the fatwa he issued to the Muslim troops when they met the enemy 
    on the outskirts of Damascus. Undoubtedly breaking the fast for that reason is more necessary than breaking it for travelling alone, rather the 
    fact that the traveller is allowed not to fast alerts us to the fact that it is allowed in this situation (i.e., jihad), for it is more apt that 
    it be allowed in this case because physical strength in that case only benefits the traveller himself, whereas in this case it benefits the 
    mujahid and the Muslims, and because the hardship of jihad is greater than the hardship of travel, and because the interest served by the mujahid 
    not fasting is greater than the interest served by the traveller not fasting. And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And make ready against them all you can 
    of power”
[al-Anfaal 8:60]
Breaking one’s fast when meeting the enemy is 
    one of the greatest means of strength and power… and the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, when they drew close to 
    their enemy: “You are approaching your enemy and breaking the fast will make you stronger.” This was a concession, and some of us fasted and some 
    of us broke our fast. Then we stopped to camp again, and he said, “You are going to meet your enemy in the morning, and breaking the fast will 
    make you stronger, so break your fast.” So we had no choice but to break our fast. 
So he gave the reason that they were approaching the enemy and they needed their physical 
    strength to meet the enemy. This is a reason other than travel. Travel is a separate reason in and of itself, and he did not mention it or refer 
    to it here. So in conclusion the principles and wisdom of the Lawgiver dictate that breaking one's fast for the purpose of jihad is more necessary 
    than doing so simply because of travelling. So how about if the reason is explained and stated clearly in the text? The Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) insisted that they should break their fast for that reason, and this is indicated by the report narrated by ‘Eesa 
    ibn Yoonus from Shu’bah from ‘Amr ibn Dinar who said: I heard Ibn ‘Umar say: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said to his companions on the day of the Conquest of Makkah: “This is a day of fighting, so break your fast.” He named fighting as the 
    reason, and used the word “fa” (= so) when issuing the command to fight. From this wording each of them understood that breaking the fast was for 
    the purpose of fighting. 
And Allaah knows best. 
The battle mentioned by Ibn al-Qayyim (may 
    Allaah have mercy on him) took place between the Muslims and the Tatars in 702 AH, and the Muslims were the victors.

    said: 
He – meaning Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) – issued a fatwa telling the people to 
    break their fast for the duration of the fighting, and he himself also broke his fast. He used to go around among the soldiers and commanders, 
    eating some food that he had in his hand, to show them that it was better for them to break their fast so that they would have more strength to 
    fight. Then the people ate.

How to make the best of Ramadan?","Praise be to Allah.Is listening to music in Ramadan haram?
Listening to music is haram , whether in Ramadan or at other times, but it is more forbidden in Ramadan, and is a greater sin. Fasting does not only mean refraining from eating and drinking, rather it means attaining piety or fear of Allah, and it means that all the physical faculties should refrain from disobeying Allah . 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“O you who believe! Observing As-Sawm (the fasting) is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, that you may become Al-Muttaqun (the pious)” [al-Baqarah 2:183]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Fasting does not just mean (abstaining) from eating and drinking, rather fasting means (abstaining) from idle and obscene talk…” Narrated by al-Hakim who said: This hadith is sahih according to the conditions of Muslim. 
The sahih Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) clearly indicates that listening to musical instruments is haram. 
Al-Bukhari narrated in a mu’allaq report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There will be among my ummah people who regard adultery, silk, pork and musical instruments as permissible…” Al-Tabarani and al-Bayhaqi said that this was a mawsul report. 
Why are musical instruments haram?
This hadith indicates that musical instruments are haram in two ways: 

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “[they] will regard… as permissible.” This clearly indicates that the things mentioned are haram, but those people will regard them as permissible. 
Musical instruments are mentioned in conjunction with things that are definitely haram, namely adultery (zina) and alcohol. If it were not haram it would not have been mentioned alongside them. (See al-Silsilah al-Sahihah by al-Albani , hadith no. 91)

Does listening to music in Ramadan invalidate the fast?
Sin (including listening to music) detracts from the reward of fasting. So the more the fasting person sins, and the more grievous his sins, the more it detracts from the reward of his fas, and he may lose the reward altogether. Thus he will have deprived himself of food and drink, and all other things that break the fast, and will also have deprived himself of the reward for that, by disobeying Allah. Hence the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “There may be someone who fasts and gets nothing from his fast except hunger, and there may be someone who prays qiyaam and gets nothing from his qiyaam but a sleepless night.” Narrated by Ibn Maajah (1690); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah.
With regard to whether the fast is invalidated by committing sins, including listening to music, fasting is not invalidated by that; rather it is valid and the fasting person has discharged his duty and is not required to make it up, but his reward is reduced because of his committing sin, and the reward may even be lost altogether, as noted above.

Muslim (1630) narrated from Abu Hurayrah that a man said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “My father has died and left behind wealth, and he did not make a will.  Will it be an expiation for him if I give in charity on his behalf?” He said, “Yes.” 
Muslim also narrated (1004) from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased wth her) that a man said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “My mother died suddenly and I think that if she could have spoken she would have given in charity [i.e., left instructions that some of her estate be given in charity]. Will I have a reward if I spend in charity on her behalf?” He said, “Yes.” 
Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
This hadeeth indicates that it is permissible to give in charity on behalf of the deceased and that doing so is mustahabb, and that the reward for that will reach the deceased and benefit him or her; it will also benefit the one who gives the charity. There is consensus on all of that among the Muslims. 
Feeding the poor is one of the acts of kindness and charity that was enjoined by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), especially providing iftaar to one who is fasting. 
Also among the best things that you can do to benefit your father and honour him is to make du’aa’ for him. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When a man dies, all his good deeds come to an end except three: ongoing charity; beneficial knowledge; and a righteous son who will pray for him.” Narrated by Muslim, 1631.
 So you should make a lot of du’aa’ for your father, during your prayer and at other times, asking Allaah to forgive him, and admit him to Paradise, and keep him away from Hell.

It was proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When Ramadan begins, the gates of Paradise are opened, and the gates of Hell are closed, and the devils are chained up.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3277; Muslim, 1079. According to al-Nasaa’i: “The most evil jinn are chained up.” 
This does not mean that the devils have no influence at all, rather it indicates that they become weaker in Ramadan and are not able to do what they are able to do at times other than Ramadan. 
It may be interpreted as meaning that the ones who are chained up are the most evil devils, not all of them. 
Al-Qurtubi said: If it is said, how come we see many evil actions and sins being committed in Ramadan, for if the devils were chained up, that would not happen? 
The answer is that (evil actions) are reduced on the part of those who fast meeting all the conditions of fasting and paying attention to the etiquette of fasting. 
Or some of the devils – namely the most evil ones – are chained up, not all of them, as previously mentioned in some reports. 
Or it may mean that evil actions are reduced in Ramadan, which is something that we can see. Even though evil actions happen in Ramadan, they are less than at other times. Even if all of the devils were to be chained up, that does not mean that no evil action would happen, because there are other causes of evil action besides the devils, such as evil souls, bad habits and the human devils.

If a person does not fast because he is lazy or heedless, some scholars say that that makes him a kaafir, although the correct view is that it does not, but he is in serious danger because he has forsaken one of the pillars of Islam on which there is consensus that it is obligatory. And he deserves to be punished and disciplined by the ruler in such a manner as to deter him from this. He must also make up the fasts that he has missed and repent to Allaah.

12656,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12656,"Commentary on the hadeeth, “Those people are disobedient, those people are disobedient.”","I heard a hadeeth which said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to the people who were fasting on a journey, “You are disobedient.” Does that mean that it is haraam for a traveller to fast?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.We have previously stated in the answer to question no. 20165 that if the traveller is finding it too difficult to fast, then it is better for him to break his fast, and fasting is makrooh for him. His fasting may become haraam if it leads to harm or the fear that he may die. 
The hadeeth to which the questioner refers may be interpreted in this way, i.e., if the traveller finds it extremely difficult to fast or if he will be harmed by fasting. The context of the hadeeth indicates this. 
Muslim (1114) narrated from Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) set out for Makkah in the year of the Conquest in Ramadaan, and he fasted until he reached Kuraa’ al-Ghameem – which is a place between Makkah and Madeenah. It was said to him that the people were finding it hard to fast, and they were waiting to see what he would do. He called for a vessel of water after ‘Asr, and he lifted it up so that the people could see it, then he drank from it. It was said to him afterwards that some of the people were still fasting. He said, “Those people are disobedient, those people are disobedient.” 
From the context of the hadeeth it may be understood that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) called them disobedient for two reasons: 
1 – They continued to fast even though it was difficult for them
2 – The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) broke his fast so that they would follow his example, so it was as if he had commanded them to break their fast but they did not do so, so he called them disobedient. 
Al-Nawawi said: 
This hadeeth is to be understood as referring to cases when fasting is harmful… This interpretation is supported by the fact that the hadeeth says that the people were finding it hard to fast. Based on this, fasting whilst travelling is not regarded as an act of disobedience or sin if a person is not harmed by it. 
Ibn al-Qayyim said in Tahdheeb al-Sunan: 
With regard to the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “Those people are disobedient,” that applies to one specific case, when he wanted them to break their fast and some of them went against him, so he said that… The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) broke his fast after ‘Asr so that his example would be followed, and when some of them did not follow his example, he said, “Those people are disobedient,” but he did not mean by that that it is haraam for the traveller to fast in all cases. 
Al-Haafiz said: 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) called those people who continued to fast whilst travelling disobedient because he had told them to do something and they went against that.  
Based on this, the hadeeth applies to a specific situation, and it is not right to apply it to all those who fast whilst travelling. 
That is also indicated by the fact that it is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to fast whilst travelling. If it was a sin to do so then the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would not have done that.

12657,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12657,What are the parts which should be washed when doing istinjaa’?,This is quite an embarrassing question which I am finding difficult to ask anyone. Please could you tell me exactly which parts are you supposed to wash when doing istinjaa? Is it sufficient to just wash the orifices or should one wash the whole penis and the areas where one has pubic hair in this region?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Istinjaa’ is obligatory; this means removing whatever has been passed from the front or back passages with water, stones, or anything else that is pure and will remove the impurity (najaasah) – such as pebbles or coarse tissue paper, or clean pieces of paper on which there is no mention of Allah or any of His names – apart from bones and dung. This is to be done when something impure is emitted, of stools or urine.
But if nothing has come out apart from passing wind, then it is not obligatory to do instinjaa’.
With regard to what has to be washed, if a person has passed urine, then it is sufficient for him to wash the end of the penis, to cleanse it of urine. It is not prescribed for him to wash the anus, because nothing has come out of it.
In the case of the back passage, he has to remove any dirt from it, then wash the anal sphincter to cleanse it of any dirt that may be attached to it.
For more information see Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, vol. 10, p. 36; al-Sharh al-Mumti’ by Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, vol. 1, p. 88.
This is what has to do with urine and stools. With regard to semen and prostatic fluid, please see question no. 2458.
There is no doubt that if the urine or stools go beyond the place where they come out, those areas must also be washed, and the impurity and dirt must be removed from them.
This is a summary of the etiquette of relieving oneself, which it is mustahabb for the Muslim to observe when relieving himself.
1 – It is Sunnah to say “Bismillaah (in the name of Allah)” when entering the washroom, because it was narrated from ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The eyes of the jinn are blocked from seeing the ‘awraat of the sons of Adam when one of them says, on entering the washroom, ‘Bismillaah.’”
(Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, al-Jumu’ah, 551. Classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh Sunan al-Tirmidhi, no. 496).
It was also proven in the hadeeth of Anas that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allahumma inni a’oodhu bika min al-khubthi wa’l-khabaa’ith (O Allah, I seek refuge in You from all offensive and wicked things (evil deeds and evil spirits).”
(Narrated by al-Bukhari, al-Wudu, 139)
2 – He should enter with his left foot first, and exit with his right foot first.
3 – If he wants to relieve himself in a place that is not designated for that purpose, it is recommended for him to go far away (from people).
4 – He should not face the qiblah or turn his back towards it when relieving himself, because of the hadeeth narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in which he said: “When any one of you needs to defecate, let him not face the qiblah or turn his back toward it; face east or west” [because Makkah is south of Madeenah – Translator].” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, al-Wudu, 141).
5 – When urinating, a person must be careful not to let drops of urine land on his clothes or body, because it was narrated in the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas that “the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) passed by one of the gardens of Madeenah or Makkah, and he heard the voices of two men who were being punished in their graves. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘They are being punished but they are not being punished for a major sin.’ Then he said, ‘No, one of them used not to take precautions to protect himself from his urine, and the other used to go about spreading slander.’ Then he called for a palm-branch, which he broke in two and placed each piece on a grave, It was said to him, ‘O Messenger of Allah, why did you do that?’ He said, ‘May their torment be reduced so long as these do not dry out’ or ‘until these dry out.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, al-Wudu, 209).
6 – He should not hold his penis with his right hand whilst urinating, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When any one of you goes to the lavatory, he should neither touch his penis nor clean his private parts with his right hand.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, al-Wudu, 149)
7 – It is not permissible to relieve oneself in the street or in the shade, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Beware of two things which provoke cursing.” They said, “What are the two things which provoke cursing, O Messenger of Allah?” He said, “Relieving oneself on the street or in the shade.” (Narrated by Muslim, al-Tahaarah, 397)
8 – It is makrooh to speak whilst relieving oneself.
9 – It is mustahabb when coming out of the washroom to say “Ghufraanak (I ask You (Allah) for Your forgiveness),” because it was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came out of the washroom, he would say, ‘Ghufraanak.’”

12658,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12658,How Did Prophet Muhammad Perform I’tikaf?,I would like to know the guidance of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) with regard to i’tikaf.,"Prophet Muhammad’s (peace and blessings be upon him) i’tikaf was moderate and not harsh. He spent all his time remembering Allah and turning to Him in worship, seeking Laylat al-Qadr.",,"Praise be to Allah.The guidance of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) with regard to i'tikaf was the most perfect and moderate of guidance. 

Once he observed i'tikaf in the first ten days of Ramadan, then in the middle ten days, seeking Laylat al-Qadr . Then he was told that it is in the last ten days, so then he always observed i'tikaf during the last ten days, until he met his Lord. 
On one occasion he did not observe i’tikaf during the last ten days, so he made it up in Shawwal and observed i'tikaf during the first ten days thereof. This was narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim. In the year in which he died, he observed i’tikaf for twenty days. Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2040. 

“It was said that the reason for that is that he knew his life was drawing to a close, so he wanted to increase his good deeds, to show his ummah how to strive hard in doing good deeds when the opportunity for doing so drew to close, so that they could meet Allah in the best way. And it was said that the reason was that Jibril used to review the Quran with him once each Ramadan, but in the year in which he died, he reviewed it with him twice, which is why his i’tikaf was twice as long as usual. 
A more likely reason is that he observed i’tikaf for twenty days in that year because the year before he had been traveling. This is indicated by the report narrated by al-Nasai and Abu Dawud, and classed as sahih by Ibn Hibban and others, from Ubayy ibn Ka’b who said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to observe i’tikaf during the last ten days of Ramadan, but he travelled one year and did not observe i’tikaf , so the following year he observed i’tikaf for twenty days.” (Fath al-Bari) 

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to order that a kind of tent be pitched for him in the mosque, and he would stay in it, keeping away from people and turning to his Lord, so he could be on his own with his Lord in a true sense of the word. 
On one occasion he observed i’tikaf in a small tent, and put a reed mat over the door. Narrated by Muslim, 1167. 

Ibn al-Qayyim said in Zad al-Ma'ad, 2/90: 
“All of this to achieve the spirit and purpose of i’tikaf, and is the opposite of what the ignorant do, whereby the place of i’tikaf becomes a place of gathering and meeting with people and chatting to them. This is one thing, and i’tikaf as observed by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is something else.” 

He used to stay in the mosque the whole time , and not leave it except to relieve himself. ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “He would not enter his house for anything except for a need when he was observing i’tikaf.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2029; Muslim, 297. According to a report narrated by Muslim: “Except for human needs.” Al-Zuhri interpreted this as referring to urination and defecation. 
He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) made sure he remained clean. He would lean his head out of the mosque into `Aishah’s apartment so that she should wash his head and comb his hair. 

Al-Bukhari (2028) and Muslim (297) narrated that `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to lean his head towards me when he was observing i’tikaf in the mosque, and I would comb his hair, when I was menstruating.” According to a report also narrated by al-Bukhari: “And I would wash it.” 
Al-Hafiz said: 
This hadith indicates that it is permissible to clean oneself, put on perfume, wash oneself, comb one’s hair etc (when in i’tikaf). The majority of scholars are of the view that nothing is makruh except that which it is makruh to do in the mosque. 

When he was in i’tikaf, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not visit the sick or attend funerals . This was so that he could concentrate fully on conversing with Allah and achieving the purpose of i’tikaf, which is to cut oneself off from people and turn to Allah. 

`Aishah said: The Sunnah is for the person in i’tikaf not to visit the sick or attend funerals, or to be intimate with his wife. But there is nothing wrong with his going out for essential needs. (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 2473; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud.) 
“or to be intimate with his wife” means intercourse. This was stated by al-Shawkani in Nayl al-Awtar. 

Some of his wives used to visit him when he was in i’tikaf. When she stood up to leave, he would take her home – that was at night. 

It was narrated from Safiyyah the wife of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that she came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and visited him when he was in i’tikaf in the mosque, during the last ten days of Ramadan. She spoke with him for a while, then she stood up to leave. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stood up with her to take her home. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2035; Muslim, 2175) 

In conclusion, his i’tikaf was moderate and not harsh. He spent all his time remembering Allah and turning to Him in worship, seeking Laylat al-Qadr.

A person

    something that is regarded as foolish and stupid. It is obvious to any wise 
    person than this kind of behaviour provokes desire, and this is the path 
    that leads to zina (fornication, adultery). It cannot be said that his 
    intention is pure, because Allaah has created men with an inclination to be 
    attracted towards women. Hence Allaah has forbidden men to look at women and 
    has commanded them to lower their gaze. Allaah says (interpretation of the

Hence it is haraam to

If the husband had intercourse with her, she has to observe ‘Iddah in different forms.","‘Iddah after divorce


Forms of ‘Iddah after divorce","Praise be to Allah.‘Iddah after divorce
If the woman is divorced by talaq before the man has entered upon her and been alone with her, i.e., before intercourse or intimacy with her, then she does not have to observe any ‘Iddah at all. Simply by virtue of the divorce it becomes permissible for her to marry another man. 
But if he has entered upon her and been alone with her and had intercourse with her, then she has to observe the ‘Iddah (waiting period) which takes one of the following forms:
Forms of ‘Iddah after divorce 

If she is pregnant then her ‘Iddah lasts until the pregnancy ends and she delivers, whether that is a long time or a short one. It may so happen that he divorces her in the morning and she gives birth at noon, in which case her ‘Iddah is over. Or it may be that he divorces her in Muharram and she does not give birth until Dhul-Hijjah, so she remains in ‘Iddah for twelve months. The point is that the ‘Iddah of the pregnant woman lasts until she gives birth, no matter what the case, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“And for those who are pregnant (whether they are divorced or their husbands are dead), their ‘Iddah (prescribed period) is until they lay down their burden.” [At-Talaq 65:4]

If the woman is not pregnant and she menstruates (is of child-bearing age), then her ‘Iddah is three complete menstrual cycles after the divorce, i.e., her period comes then she becomes pure, then her period comes again and she becomes pure, then her period comes again and she becomes pure. That is three complete menstrual cycles, regardless of whether the time between them is long or short. Based on this, if he divorces her and she is breastfeeding and does not menstruate until two years later, then she remains in ‘Iddah until she has had three menstrual cycles, so she may stay in this state for two years or more. The point is that she should go through three complete menstrual cycles whether the time involved is long or short, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“And divorced women shall wait (as regards their marriage) for three menstrual periods.” [al-Baqarah 2:228]

If a woman does not menstruate, either because she is very young or old and past menopause, then her ‘Iddah is three months, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“And those who no longer expect menstruation among your women - if you doubt, then their period is three months, and [also for] those who have not menstruated.” [At-Talaq 65:4]

If a woman’s periods have ceased for a known reason and she will not menstruate again, such as if her uterus has been removed (hysterectomy), then she is like one who has passed menopause and her ‘Iddah is three months. 
If her periods have ceased and she knows the cause, she should wait for the cause to cease and for her periods to return, then she should observe ‘Iddah according to her menstrual cycle. 
If her periods have ceased and she doesn't know what caused that, then the scholars say that she should observe an ‘Iddah of a full year, nine months for pregnancy and three months for ‘Iddah. 

These are the categories of ‘Iddah for women divorced by Talaq.

12670,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12670,Animal-derived ingredients in non-food products,"It was mentioned in question 210 that their was a difference of scholarly opinion concerning the use of animal-derived ingredients in non-food products such as lotions and soaps and whether we as Muslims can use these products. I wanted to know if you could clarify this point and the meaning of the ayah and hadiths that follow: ""Say (O Muhammad): ""I find not in that which has been inspired to me anything forbidden to be eaten by one who wishes to eat it, unless it be Maytah (a dead animal) or blood poured forth..."" 6:145   the hadith: Jabir b. Abdullah (RAA) reported Allah's Messenger (S) as saying in the Year of Victory while he was in Mecca: Verily Allah and His Messenger have forbidden the sale of wine,carcass,swine,and idols. It was said: Allah's Messenger, you see that the fat of the carcasss is used for coating the boats and varnishing the hides and people use it for lighting purposes, whereupon he said: No, it is forbidden. Then Allah's Messenger (S) said: May Allah the Exalted and Majestic destroy the Jews; when Allah forbade the use of fat of the carcass for them, they melted it,and then sold it and made use of its price (received from it). [Sahih Muslim Eng. Trans. Vol. 3 Hadith 3840]   The freed slave girl of Maimuna was given a goat in charity but it died. The Messenger of Allah (S) happened to pass by that (carcass). Upon this he said: Why did you not take off its skin? You could put it to use, after tanning it. They (the Companions) said: It was dead. Upon this he (the Messenger of Allah) said: Only its eating is prohibited. [Sahih Muslim Eng. Trans. Vol. 1 Haidith 704].",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
With regard to the ruling on using fats from haraam animals in manufacturing soap etc., we have mentioned in the question referred to that there is a difference of scholarly opinion, but it is most likely the case that they are haraam and we are not allowed to use them. 
We will explain this further – in sha Allah – in the following points. 
Secondly: 
With regard to the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say (O Muhammad): ‘I find not in that which has been revealed to me anything forbidden to be eaten by one who wishes to eat it, unless it be Maytah (a dead animal) or blood poured forth (by slaughtering or the like), or the flesh of swine (pork); for that surely, is impure or impious (unlawful) meat (of an animal) which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allaah (or has been slaughtered for idols, or on which Allaah’s Name has not been mentioned while slaughtering). But whosoever is forced by necessity without wilful disobedience, nor transgressing due limits; (for him) certainly, your Lord is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful’”
[al-An’aam 6:145]
its meaning is as follows: 
“Say (O Muhammad): ‘I find not in that which has been revealed to me anything forbidden to be eaten” – Here Allaah is commanding His slave and Messenger Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): Say, O Muhammad, my Lord has not forbidden any foods apart from these; everything else is halaal (permissible). 
“unless it be Maytah (a dead animal)” this refers to whatever dies a natural death, such as an animal that is dealt a fatal blow, falls or is gored by another, or that which is slaughtered in a manner other than that which is prescribed in sharee’ah. 
“or blood poured forth (by slaughtering or the like)” means blood that flows, unlike other things that are described as “blood” (damm), such as the liver and spleen, and unlike the blood which remains in the flesh and veins after slaughter. 
“or the flesh of swine (pork)” which is the well known animal (pig). 
“for that surely, is impure” means it is filthy, abominable and harmful. 
“or impious (unlawful) meat (of an animal) which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allaah (or has been slaughtered for idols, or on which Allaah’s Name has not been mentioned while slaughtering)” means, it has been slaughtered in a name other than His. 
“But whosoever is forced by necessity” to eat one of the things mentioned here, “without wilful disobedience” not wanting to eat it without being forced to, “nor transgressing due limits” – “(for him) certainly, your Lord is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful” means, He will forgive him for what he has eaten, and will be Merciful towards him. 
However, we should note that there are other haraam things which are not mentioned in this verse. They were forbidden later on, such as every wild animal that has fangs and every bird that has talons, and the meat of domestic donkeys. 
Thirdly: 
The hadeeth of Jaabir was narrated by al-Bukhaari (2121) and Muslim (1581). 
The wording is as follows: It was narrated from Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that he heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say on the day of the Conquest when he was in Makkah: “Allaah and His Messenger have forbidden the sale of alcohol, dead meat, pigs and idols.” It was said, “O Messenger of Allaah, what do you think of the fat taken from a dead animal which is used for caulking ships, greasing animal skins and which people use to light their lamps?” He said, “No, it is haraam.” Then the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “May Allaah curse the Jews, for Allaah forbade them the fat, but they melted it then they sold it and consumed its price.” 
With regard to the meaning: 
It is clear that the context is explaining the prohibition on selling alcohol (khamr – that which fogs (khaamara) the mind – which includes all kinds of alcohol), dead meat, pigs and idols – which are things made from wood, copper, gold, etc, in the form of people or animals. 
Then the Sahaabah wanted to make an exception from this prohibition in the case of selling the fat of dead animals, because of the benefits that there were in it, which that it was used as caulking for ships, to protect the wood from water, and to grease animal skins in order to keep them soft and supple, and as fuel for lamps. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not make these things exceptions from the prohibition, as he said, “No, it is forbidden.” Then he mentioned what the Jews did, which was that they melted down the fat that Allaah has forbidden to them, and turned it into another substance, such as wax, which they then sold and consumed its price.
The scholars differed as to what the pronoun huwa (it) in the Prophet’s phrase Laa, huwa haraam (No, it is forbidden) referred. Some of them said that what is haraam is benefitting from the thing; others said that what is haraam is selling it. The latter view is the one which was regarded as correct by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him), who said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’ (8/136): 
“This view is the one which is correct: that the pronoun in the phrase ‘it is forbidden’ refers to selling, even though the substance in question has these uses that the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) mentioned. That is because the context of the hadeeth has to do with selling. 
And it was said that ‘it is forbidden’ refers to benefitting from it in these ways, so it is not permissible to caulk ships with it, or grease animal skins with it, or to use it in people’s lamps. But this view is da’eef (weak). 
The correct view is that it is permissible to caulk ships with it, and grease animal skins, and use it in people’s lamps.” 
Al-San’aani said: 
The pronoun in the phrase ‘it is forbidden’ is to be understood as referring to selling, i.e., that selling the fat is haraam. This is the most apparent meaning, because this is what is implied by the context, and because the same hadeeth was narrated by Ahmad, in whose version it says, ‘And what do you think of selling the fat of dead meat?’ Or it may be interpreted as referring to the uses to which it is put, in the phrase, ‘for it is used for caulking ships’ etc.. The majority interpreted it in this manner and said, ‘No use should be made of a dead animal apart from its skin, if it is tanned.’ 
Those who say that the pronoun refers to selling quote as evidence the fact that there is scholarly consensus that it is permissible to feed dead meat to dogs even if they are hunting dogs. It is known that the pronoun is more likely to refer to selling, so it is permissible to make use of naajis (impure) things in general and it is haraam to sell them for the reasons that are known. This view is supported by the fact that the Prophet (S) condemned the Jews for melting down the fat then selling it and consuming its price. So it is clear that the prohibition is directed against the selling which results in the consumption of its price. If the prohibition applies to selling then it is permissible to make use of the fat of dead animals and impure (naajis) fats for all purposes except food for humans or use on human bodies. (i.e., it is not permissible for a human being to eat the fat from a dead animal or to apply impure (naajis) fats to his body). So the prohibition is like the prohibition on eating dead meat or using impure substances on the body. But it is permissible to feed the fat of dead animals to dogs or to feed honey that is contaminated with an impure substance to bees. All of that is regarded as permissible in the Shaafa’i madhhab, and was narrated by al-Qaadi ‘Iyaad from Maalik and most of his companions, and from Abu Haneefah and his companions, and from al-Layth. 
This hadeeth also indicates that if it is haraam to sell a thing, its price is also forbidden, and that every contrivance that leads to permitting something which is forbidden is false.
Subul al-Salaam, 3/6. 
Fourthly: 
With regard to the hadeeth of Maymoonah, it was narrated by al-Bukhaari (1421) and Muslim (363). The following version is quoted from Muslim because the version narrated by al-Bukhaari does not contain the word “tanning”. 
It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas said: A sheep was given in charity to the freed slave woman of Maymoonah, and it died. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) passed by it and said: “Why do you not take its skin, tan it and make use of it?” They said, “It is dead meat.” He said, “It is only haraam to eat it.” 
With regard to its meaning: 
Maymoonah had a freed slave woman who had a sheep that someone had given to her in charity. When it died, they thought that it was not permissible to make any use of it at all, so they threw it away. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) passed by it with some of his companions and when he saw it, he said to them “Why do you not take the skin of this dead animal and make use of it?” They said to him, “It is dead meat.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to them, “What is forbidden is to eat it; with regard to anything other than eating it, such as making use of the skin, that is permissible after tanning it.” 
The scholars differed concerning the ruling on the skin of dead animals if it is tanned.  Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen favoured the view that tanning purifies the skin of the dead animal if it is from an animal whose meat may be eaten, such as camels, cattle and sheep. But if it comes from an animal whose meat may not be eaten, such as pigs, then it cannot be purified by tanning.
Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 1/72.
 Shaykh al-Islam said, after quoting the views of the scholars: 
The point of confusion has to do with tanning: is it the case that the skin of animals which pure when they are alive may be purified by tanning when they are dead or is it the case that tanning can only purify the skin of an animal that is slaughtered properly according to sharee’ah? The second opinion is more likely to be correct, and the evidence for that is that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade using the skin of carnivores, as was narrated by Usaamah ibn ‘Umayr al-Dhuhali.  Narrated by Ahmad, Abu Dawood, and al-Nasaa’i. Al-Tirmidhi added the phrase “and (he forbade) their use as furnishing.”  
This opinion reconciles all the ahaadeeth .

As for those who fast in Ramadaan and pray only in Ramadaan, they are trying to deceive Allaah. How bad are those who only acknowledge Allaah in Ramadaan. Their fast is not valid if they only pray in Ramadaan, rather by doing this they are kaafirs who are guilty of major kufr, even if they do not deny that prayer is obligatory; this is according to the more correct of the two scholarly views. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “The covenant that stands between us and them is prayer; whoever does not pray is a kaafir.” Narrated by Imam Ahmad, 22428; al-Tirmidhi, 2621; al-Nasaa’i, 431; Ibn Maajah, 1079 – with a saheeh isnaad from Buraydah al-Aslami (may Allaah be pleased with him).

    exchange worn-out gold for good gold and pay the difference. This is haraam

    with him), who brought some good dates to the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) and he said to him: “Where did these come

Obligatory movements in prayer


Forbidden movements in prayer


Mustahabb movements in prayer


Permissible movements n prayer


Makruh movements in prayer


How much movement invalidates the prayer","Praise be to Allah.Types of moving while praying
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) stated that the basic ruling on moving while praying is that it is makruh unless it is done for a reason. However it may be divided into five categories: 

Obligatory movements
Forbidden movements
Makruh movements
Mustahabb movements
Permissible movements

Obligatory movements in prayer
The obligatory movements are those on which the validity of the prayer depends. For example if a person notices something impure on his ghutrah (head gear), he has to move to remove it and take off his ghutrah. That is because Jibril came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he was leading the people in prayer and told him that there was something dirty on his shoe. So the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) took it off while he was praying and carried on praying. (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 650; classed as sahih by al-Albani in al-Irwa, 284)
Or if someone tells him that he is not facing the qiblah, he should move to face the qiblah. 
Forbidden movements in prayer
The forbidden movements are continuous movements done for no reason, because this kind of movement invalidates the prayer, and whatever invalidates the prayer is not permissible, because it is like mocking the signs of Allah. 
Mustahabb movements in prayer
The mustahabb movements are those done in order to do things that are mustahabb in prayer, such as if a person moves to make the row straight, or if he sees a gap in the row in front, so he moves forward whilst praying, or if there is a gap in his row and he moves to fill the gap and other such movements which allow one to do a deed that is mustahabb in prayer, because that makes the prayer more perfect and complete. Hence when Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) prayed with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and stood to his left, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) took hold of his head from behind and made him stand on his right. (Agreed upon) 
Permissible movements n prayer
The permissible movements are small movements done when there is a reason, or large movements done in cases of necessity. Small movements done for a reason are like what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did when he was praying and he carried Umamah, the daughter of Zaynab the daughter of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), whose maternal grandfather he was. When he stood up he picked her up, and when he prostrated he put her down. Al-Bukhari, 5996; Muslim, 543. 
Large movements in cases of necessity include praying while fighting. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Guard strictly (five obligatory) As-Salawat (the prayers) especially the middle Salah (i.e. the best prayer - ‘Asr). And stand before Allah with obedience [and do not speak to others during the Salah (prayers)].
239. And if you fear (an enemy), perform Salah (pray) on foot or riding. And when you are in safety, offer the Salah (prayer) in the manner He has taught you, which you knew not (before).” [al-Baqarah 2:238-239]
If a person prays while walking he is undoubtedly moving a great deal, but in cases of necessity that is permitted and does not invalidate the prayer. 
Makruh movements in prayer
The makruh movements are all movements other than those mentioned above. This is the basic principle concerning movements while praying.
How much movement invalidates the prayer
Based on this, we say to those who move whilst praying that their action is makruh and detracts from their prayer. This is something that is seen in many cases, so you may see a person fiddling with his watch or pen or ghutrah or nose or beard and so on. All of that comes under the heading of makruh, unless it is done a great deal and is continuous, in which case it is haram and invalidates the prayer. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) also stated that there is no specific number of movements that invalidates the prayer, rather it is any movement that contradicts the idea of prayer in the sense that if anyone saw this man doing that it would look as if he were not praying. This is the kind of movement that invalidates the prayer. Hence the scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) defined it as something based on custom (al-‘urf) and said: “If movements are many and are continuous, then they invalidate the prayer without mentioning a specific number. Some scholars defined three such movements but that requires evidence because everyone who sets a certain limit or number or manner should produce evidence, otherwise he is introducing new ideas.” (Majmu’ Fatawa al-Shaykh, 13/309-311) 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about a man who moved a great deal whilst praying: did that invalidate his prayer and how could he rid himself of this habit? 
He (may Allah have mercy on him) replied: 
“The Sunnah is to focus on one’s prayer with proper humility, body and soul, whether it is an obligatory prayer or a nafl prayer, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Successful indeed are the believers. Those who offer their Salaah (prayers) with all solemnity and full submissiveness.” [Al-Muminun 23:1-2]
He must pray in a tranquil and dignified manner. This is one of the most important pillars and obligations of prayer, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to one who prayed badly and was not tranquil and dignified in his prayer: “Go back and pray for you have not prayed.” And he did that three times. Then the man said: “O Messenger of Allah, by the One Who sent you with the truth, I cannot do any better than this, teach me.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When you stand up to pray, do wudu well, then turn to face the qiblah and say takbir, and recite whatever you can of the Quran. Then bow until you are at ease in bowing, then raise your head until you are standing up straight. Then prostrate until you are at ease in prostration, then sit up until you are sitting up straight and are at ease in sitting. Then prostrate until you are at ease in prostration, then get up until you are standing up straight. Then do that throughout your prayer.” (Agreed upon)  
According to a version narrated by Abu Dawud, he said: “Then recite the Essence of the Quran (al-Fatihah) and whatever Allah wills.” 
This sahih hadith indicates that being at ease in the postures is a pillar or essential part of the prayer, and an important obligation, without which prayer is not valid. Whoever pecks out his prayer (by moving too rapidly), there is no prayer for him. Khushu` (proper focus and humility) is the essence of prayer. It is prescribed for the believer to pay attention to that and strive to achieve it. 
With regard to defining the movements that contradict this ease and focus in prayer and limiting them to three movements, there is no hadith from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to support this idea. Rather that is the suggestion of some scholars for which there is no reliable evidence. 
But it is makruh to fidget during the prayer, such as touching one's nose, beard or clothes and being distracted by that. Fidgeting a great deal invalidates the prayer. But if it is done a little, according to what is customary, or is done a great deal but is not continuous, then the prayer is not invalidated thereby. But it is prescribed for the believer to maintain proper focus and humility, and to avoid fidgeting a little or a lot, and to strive to make his prayer perfect. 
The evidence that small movements, or repeated movements that are not continuous, do not invalidate the prayer is the report which says that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) opened the door for ‘Aishah one day whilst he was praying. Narrated by Abu Dawud, 922; al-Nasai, 601; classed as sahih by Shaykh al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi, 601.  
And it was proven in the hadith of Abu Qatadah (may Allah have mercy on him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) led the people in prayer one day when he was carrying Umamah the daughter of Zaynab. When he prostrated he put her down and when he stood up he picked her up.” (Fatawa ‘Ulama al-Balad al-Haram, 162-164)

    Women’s problems with their menses are endless, and one of 
    the causes of that is their use of contraceptive pills and pills used to 
    prevent menstruation. 

    People never used to face such problems before. It is true 
    that there have always been some problems since the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) came and since women were created, but this 
    situation where people are so confused is something regrettable. However, 
    the basic principle is that if a woman becomes pure (her period ends) and 
    she sees the tuhr (white discharge) which signals that her period has indeed 
    ended, then any brownish or yellowish discharge that she sees after that, or 
    any drops or wetness, is not menses, so it does not prevent her form 
    praying, fasting or having intercourse with her husband, because it is not 
    menses. 

    Umm ‘Atiyyah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: “We used 
    not to regard the yellowish or brownish discharge after the tuhr as anything 
    important.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari. Abu Dawood added the phrase “after the 
    tuhr”. Its isnaad is saheeh. 

    Based on this we say: Everything that happens after the 
    definite tuhr does not affect the woman and it does not prevent her from 
    praying, fasting and having intercourse with her husband. But she should not 
    be in a hurry to see the tuhr because some women, when the flow becomes 
    lighter, hasten to do ghusl before seeing the tuhr. Hence the women of the 
    Sahaabah used to send pieces of cotton to the Mother of the Believers 
    ‘Aa’ishah on which there were traces of yellow, and she would say to them: 
    “Do not hasten until you see the white discharge.”","Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen , Majmoo’at As’ilah tahumm al-Usrah al-Muslimah, p. 25"
12699,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12699,Ruling on gifts given by pharmaceutical company reps to doctors,"My question is about what is done by advertising reps of pharmaceutical companies. Nowadays some or most of these companies operate by means of gifts or bribes. They give gifts to doctors so that they will prescribe the drugs that are produced by these companies, and the reps fear for their positions in the companies if they do not do that. Many doctors will not prescribe drugs for patients because they have not been given gifts, and will only prescribe the drugs sold by those who have given them gifts. So the reps are forced to compete with other companies in the matter of gift giving. What is the ruling on this? 

Is it regarded as a case of necessity because he fears losing his job, or not? Especially since he may have financial obligations which he must fulfil.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The company rep who gives gifts to doctors so that they will 
    distribute the drugs of that company and not others is regarded as the 
    intermediary between the one who is giving the bribe and the one who is 
    taking it. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    cursed all three and said: “May Allaah curse the one who gives a bribe, the 
    one who takes it and the intermediary between them.” 

    And Allaah is the Source of strength. May Allaah send 
    blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and 
    companions.","From Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Fataawa al-Daa’imah, 23/571"
