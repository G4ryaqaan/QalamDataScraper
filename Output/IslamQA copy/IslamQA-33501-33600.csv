33582,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/33582,If the iqaamah is given when he is praying naafil,Suppose i am praying sunah and the iqamah is being announced. should i perform the salutation and join salatul farz or should i continue ?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Muslim (710) narrated from Abu Hurayrah that 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When the iqaamah for prayer is given, there is no prayer except the prescribed 
    prayer.” 
This hadeeth indicates that once the iqaamah 
    has been given for prayer, then no one should start to offer a naafil prayer. 
Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    said: “When the iqaamah for prayer is given, do not be distracted from it by naafil prayer, whether one fears missing the first rak’ah or not. 
    This is the view of Abu Hurayrah, Ibn ‘Umar, ‘Urwah, Ibn Sireen, Sa’eed ibn Jubayr, al-Shaafa’i, Ishaaq and Abu Thawr.” Al-Mughni, 1/272 
Some of the scholars also quoted this hadeeth as evidence that the person who is offering a 
    naafil prayer when the iqaamah is given should cut short that prayer. 
Al-Haafiz al-‘Iraaqi said: “His words ‘there 
    is no prayer’ may be interpreted as meaning that he should not start a naafil prayer in that case; or it may be interpreted as meaning that he 
    should not be distracted by a naafil prayer, and if he had started it before the iqaamah then he should cut it short so that he can catch up with 
    the opening takbeer [with the imam], or that it is invalid in and of itself even if the worshipper does not cut it short. It may be understood as 
    meaning both of these.” 
It was narrated from Shaykh Abu Haamid, one 
    of the Shaafa’is, that it is better to stop the naafil prayer if completing means that he is going to miss the opening takbeer with the imam. (The 
    words of al-‘Iraaqi were quoted by al-Shawkaani in Nayl al-Awtaar, 3/91). 
This was also stated in a fatwa issued by the 
    Standing Committee, when they were asked: 
Is it permissible to cut short a naafil 
    prayer and join the opening takbeer with the imam, or should one complete the naafil prayer? 
They replied: 
Yes, if the iqaamah for an obligatory prayer 
    is given, then you should cut short your naafil prayer so that you can join the opening takbeer with the imam, because it was proven that the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If the iqaamah for prayer is given, then there is no prayer but the prescribed 
    prayer.” 
Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 
    7/312 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy 
    on him) said that the correct view [?] is that if the iqaamah for prayer is given whilst the person is still in the first rak’ah of a naafil 
    prayer, then he should cut it short; if that happens when he is in the second rak’ah then he should complete it quickly and not cut it short. 
He said (may Allaah have mercy on him): 
What we think concerning this matter is that if you are in the second rak’ah, then you should 
    complete it quickly, but if you are in the first rak’ah, then you should cut it short. Our evidence for that is the words of the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Whoever catches up with one rak’ah of the prayer has caught up with the prayer” (narrated by al-Bukhaari, 
    580; Muslim, 607). So the person who has prayed a rak’ah before the iqaamah for prayer is given has caught up with a rak’ah that is free of any 
    impediments, which here means the iqaamah for prayer, so he has caught up with the prayer by doing a rak’ah before the prayer becomes disallowed, 
    so he should complete it quickly… Then he said: This is the view that reconciles all the evidence. 
Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 
    4/238 
If he cuts short the naafil prayer he should 
    do so without saying the tasleem. 
The Standing Committee was asked (7/312): If 
    the iqaamah for prayer is given and there is a person who is doing two rak’ahs of Sunnah prayer or “Greeting the Mosque”, should he cut short his 
    prayer so that he can offer the obligatory prayer with the congregation? If the answer is yes, then should he say the tasleem when cutting short 
    his prayer, or should he cut it short without the tasleem? 
They replied: 
The more correct of the two scholarly views 
    is that he should cut short that prayer, and there is no need to say the tasleem when doing so. Then he should join the imam.

33583,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/33583,Are precious stones mentioned in the Qur’aan?,Please let me know about this query ? how many stones [ precious / semi precious ] are mentioned in the holy quran ? in which surah are they mentioned ? is there any spiritual significance of these stones ?,,,"Praise be to Allah.The primary purpose of the Qur’aan is to 
    guide mankind to Allaah, so that they will affirm His Oneness and worship Him alone, and attain His Paradise and His pleasure. The Qur’aan is not 
    a book of science, medicine or astronomy, even though its verses may contain a little of such things. 
Hence the Muslim should not let himself be 
    distracted from the greater purpose of reciting the Qur’aan and look for the number of stones or rivers or kinds of animals mentioned therein. 
Some precious stones such as rubies, pearls 
    and coral are mentioned in the Qur’aan. 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“(In beauty) they are like rubies and 
    coral”
[al-Rahmaan 55:58] 
“Out of them both come out pearl and 
    coral”
[al-Rahmaan 55:22] 
“Like unto preserved pearls”
[al-Waaqi’ah 56:23] 
“And round about them will (serve) boys of 
    everlasting youth. If you see them, you would think them scattered pearls”
[al-Insaan 76:19]
These stones do not have any spiritual significance, rather they are mentioned in the Qur’aan 
    to explain the blessings that Allaah has bestowed upon His slaves, of the seas and the things that are brought forth from them, or as a metaphor – 
    so al-hoor al-‘iyn are likened to rubies, coral and preserved pearls, combining the purity of rubies and the whiteness of pearls and 
    coral. 
The boys are likened to scattered pearls, to 
    indicate their beauty and good looks.

33591,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/33591,"An illegitimate daughter is asking, Whose daughter am I?","I'm an illegitimate child. I was conceived before my mother became Muslim.  She became Muslim a few days before my birth. My parents married when I was 10 months old. My parents got divorced 2 years ago, after I disclosed sexual abuse by him.  I have used my father's name since I was born and he has always accepted paternity of me. Do I need to change my name to my mother's name?  I am 14 year old and have five siblings, all with my father's name. I read the answers on this site and all seemed to say that I should, but one answer by Shaykh 'Abd-Allah ibn Jibreen seemed to say the opposite. ( Reference Number 5967)  He stated that if the father accepts paternity, it is permissible to retain his name. Please clarify this issue for me.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: we confirm that the illegitimate 
    child has nothing to do with his parents’ crime, and that he has all the same rights as any other Muslim, male or female. He must also fear Allaah 
    so that he may become one of the people of Paradise with whom Allaah is pleased. 
Secondly: the scholars differed as to whether 
    or not the child may be attributed to his adulterous father, if the woman was not married. 
What that means is: if the woman was married 
    and had a child six months after being married, then the child should be attributed to the father, and he cannot deny the child unless he divorces 
    his wife by means of li’aan. If a man claims that he committed zina with this woman and that this is his illegitimate child, no attention should 
    be paid to him, according to scholarly consensus, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “The child is to be 
    attributed to the husband and the adulterer deserves nothing.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2053; Muslim, 1457. 
Ibn Qudaamah said: “The scholars were 
    unanimously agreed that if a child is born to one man’s wife, and another man claims it is his child, the child is not to be attributed to the 
    latter. The difference of opinion arises when a child is born outside of marriage.” 
If the woman is not married, and she has a 
    child as a result of zina, and the zaani (adulterer, man who committed zina) claims it is his child, should the child be attributed to him or 
    not? 
The majority of scholars are of the view that 
    the child should not be attributed to him. 
It was narrated from al-Hasan, Ibn Sireen, 
    ‘Urwah, al-Nakha’i, Ishaaq and Sulaymaan ibn Yassaar that the child should be attributed to him. 
This was also the view favoured by Shaykh 
    al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him). 
Ibn Qudaamah also narrated this view from Abu 
    Haneefah. He said: “ ‘Ali ibn ‘Aasim narrated that Abu Haneefah said: If a man commits zina with a woman and she gets pregnant from him, I do not 
    see anything wrong with him marrying her even though she is pregnant, so as to conceal her (sin), and the child will be his child.” (al-Mughni, 
    9/122). 
Ibn Muflih (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Our shaykh [Ibn Taymiyah] favoured the view 
    that a man may attribute to himself a child who is the result of zina with an unmarried woman.  al-Furoo’, 6/625 
Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    said: The illegitimate child should not be attributed to the zaani according to the majority of scholars, but al-Hasan and Ibn Sireen said: he may 
    be attributed to the zaani if the hadd punishment has been carried out on him, and he may inherit from him. Ibraaheem said: He may be attributed 
    to him if the hadd punishment of flogging has been carried out, or if he becomes the owner of the woman with whom he had intercourse. Ishaaq said: 
    He may be attributed to him, and he quoted something similar from ‘Urwah and Sulaymaan ibn Yassaar. 
Shaykh al-Islam (Ibn Taymiyah) said: There are also two views among the scholars concerning the 
    zaani claiming the child as his if the woman is not married. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The child is to 
    be attributed to the husband and the adulterer deserves nothing.” So he said that the child belongs to the husband, not the zaani. But if the 
    woman is not married then this hadeeth is not applicable. ‘Umar attributed children born in the jaahiliyyah to their fathers, but this is not the 
    place to discuss this issue in detail. 
Al-Fataawa al-Kubra, 
    3/178 
The majority of scholars quoted as evidence 
    that the illegitimate child should not be attributed to the zaani the hadeeth narrated by Ahmad (7002), Abu Dawood (2265) and Ibn Maajah (2746) 
    from ‘Amr ibn Shu’ayb from his father from his grandfather who said: “The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) ruled that 
    whoever is born to a slave woman who was not owned by his father, or (was born to) a free woman with whom (the father) committed zina, then he 
    cannot be attributed to him nor can he inherit, even if the one to whom he is attributed claims him as a son. He is the child of fornication 
    whether his mother was a free woman or a slave.”  
This hadeeth was classed as hasan by 
    al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, and by al-Arna’oot in Tahqeeq al-Musnad. It was quoted as evidence by Ibn Muflih to support the 
    view of the majority. 
The Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) ruled that the illegitimate child should not be attributed to the zaani and could not inherit from him, even if the zaani 
    claimed him as his child.  
Undoubtedly attributing the child to a 
    particular person is a serious matter on which many rulings of sharee’ah depend, such as matters of inheritance, who is forbidden for marriage 
    (mahrams) and who are his relatives. 
The point is that the fatwa which says that 
    the illegitimate child should not be attributed to the zaani is in accordance with the view of the majority of scholars. 
With regard to Shaykh Ibn Jibreen (may Allaah 
    preserve him), perhaps he based his view on the other scholarly view which we have mentioned above. 
Based on the view of the majority, the 
    illegitimate child – whether male or female – should not be attributed to the zaani, and should not be described as his child. Rather he should be 
    attributed to his mother; he is a mahram for her and may inherit from her like all her other children. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “With regard to the child who is 
    born as a result of zina, he is the child of his mother, not of his father, because of the general meaning of the hadeeth in which the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘The child is to be attributed to the husband and the adulterer deserves nothing’ – i.e., 
    this is not his child. This is what the hadeeth means. If the man marries her after repenting, then the child has been conceived before marriage 
    and repentance and is not his child; he cannot inherit from the man who committed zina even if he claims him as his child, because he is not his 
    legitimate child.” 
From Fataawa Islamiyyah, 3/370. 
In Fataawa al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn 
    Ibraaheem (11/146) it says: The child who is created from the sperm of the zaani cannot be called the child of the zaani.

33592,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/33592,Adding the words wa’l-shukr after rising from rukoo’,"Some people add the words “wa’l-shukr (and thanks)” after saying “Rabbana wa laka’l-hamd (Our Lord, and to You be praise)” [when rising from rukoo’ or bowing in the prayer]. What is your opinion on that?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: 
Undoubtedly it is better to adhere to the 
    dhikrs narrated (in the texts). When a person rises from bowing, he should say, “Rabbana wa laka’l-hamd” and not add the word “wa’l-shukr”, 
    because this was not narrated in the texts. 
There are four narrated versions of what is 
    to be said after rising from bowing: 
1 – Rabbana wa laka’l-hamd (Our Lord, 
    and to You be praise) 
2 – Rabbana laka’l-hamd (Our Lord, to 
    You be praise) 
3 – Allaahumma Rabbana laka’l-hamd (O 
    Allaah, Our Lord, to You be praise) 
4 – Allaahumma Rabbana wa laka’l-hamd 
    (O Allaah, Our Lord, and to You be praise) 
These four versions may all be said, but not 
    all at once, rather you should say one of them one time and another another time. So in some prayers you could say, Rabbana wa laka’l-hamd 
    (Our Lord, and to You be praise); and in some prayers you could say, Rabbana laka’l-hamd (Our Lord, to You be praise); and in others say,
    Allaahumma Rabbana laka’l-hamd (O Allaah, Our Lord, to You be praise); and in yet others say, Allaahumma Rabbana wa laka’l-hamd (O 
    Allaah, Our Lord, and to You be praise). 
With regard to the words wa’l-shukr, this was not narrated so it is better not to say it.","Fataawa Arkaan al-Islam, p. 326"
