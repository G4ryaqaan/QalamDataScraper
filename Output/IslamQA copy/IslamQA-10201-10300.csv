The Standing Committee on Academic Research and Issuing Fatwas (al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah li’l-Buhooth al-‘Ilmiyyah wa’l-Iftaa’) has examined the questions which have been submitted to it and the opinions and articles published and broadcast in the media concerning the call to unite the three religions of Islam, Judaism and Christianity; and the call which stems from that, to build a mosque, a church and a synagogue in one place, on university campuses and in public squares; and the call to print the Quran, Tawraat (Torah) and Injeel (Gospel) in one volume, etc.; and the conferences, seminars and meetings on this topic which are being held in the east and in the west. After studying and pondering the matter, the Committee issues the following statement:


(1)One of the basic principles of belief in Islam, something which is obviously a basic principle and on which all the Muslims are agreed (ijmaa’) is that there is no true religion on the face of the earth apart from Islam. It is the final religion which abrogates all religions and laws that came before it There is no religion on earth according to which Allah is to be worshipped apart from Islam. Allah says (interpretation of the meanings):


“This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islâm as your religion” [al-Maa’idah 5:3]
“And whoever seeks a religion other than Islâm, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:85].
After the coming of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), Islam means what he brought, not any other religion.


(2)One of the basic principles of belief in Islam is that the Book of Allah, the Holy Quran, is the last of the Books to be revealed from the Lord of the Worlds. It abrogates all the Books that came before it, the Tawraat, Zaboor, Injeel and others, and it is a Muhaymin [Muhaymin: that which testifies the truth that is therein and falsifies the falsehood that is added therein] over them. So there is no longer any revealed Book according to which Allah may be worshipped apart from the Quran. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):


“And We have sent down to you (O Muhammad) the Book (this Quran) in truth, confirming the Scripture that came before it and Muhaymin (trustworthy in highness and a witness) over it (old Scriptures). So judge among them by what Allah has revealed, and follow not their vain desires, diverging away from the truth that has come to you.” [al-Maa’idah 5:48]


(3)It is obligatory to believe that the Tawraat and Injeel have been abrogated by the Quran, and that they have been altered and distorted, with things added and taken away, as Allah tells us in the Quran, for example (interpretation of the meaning):


“So, because of their breach of their covenant, We cursed them and made their hearts grow hard. They change the words from their (right) places and have abandoned a good part of the Message that was sent to them. And you will not cease to discover deceit in them, except a few of them” [al-Maa’idah 5:13]
“Then woe to those who write the Book with their own hands and then say, “This is from Allah,” to purchase with it a little price! Woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for that they earn thereby.” [al-Baqarah 2:79]
“And verily, among them is a party who distort the Book with their tongues (as they read), so that you may think it is from the Book, but it is not from the Book, and they say: “This is from Allah,” but it is not from Allah; and they speak a lie against Allah while they know it” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:78]
Hence, whatever in the previous books was correct is abrogated by Islam, and everything else is distorted and changed. It was reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) became angry when he saw that ‘Umar had a page with something from the Tawraat written on it, and he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Are you in doubt, O son of al-Khattaab? Have I not brought you something shining and pure? If my brother Moosa were alive, he would have no choice but to follow me.” (Narrated by Ahmad and al-Daarimi, and others).


(4)One of the basic principles of belief in Islam is that our Prophet and Messenger Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the Seal of the Prophets and Messengers, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):


“Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but he is the Messenger of Allah and the last (end) of the Prophets” [al-Ahzaab 33:40]
So there is no longer any Messenger whom it is obligatory to follow, apart from Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). If any of the Prophets were alive, they would have no choice but to follow him, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And (remember) when Allah took the Covenant of the Prophets, saying: ‘Take whatever I gave you from the Book and Hikmah (understanding of the Laws of Allah), and afterwards there will come to you a Messenger (Muhammad) confirming what is with you; you must, then, believe in him and help him.’ Allah said: ‘Do you agree (to it) and will you take up My Covenant (which I conclude with you)?’ They said: ‘We agree.’ He said: ‘Then bear witness; and I am with you among the witnesses (for this).’” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:81]
When the Prophet of Allah ‘Eesaa (peace be upon him) descends at the end of time, he will follow Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and he will judge according to his Sharee’ah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning);
“Those who follow the Messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor write (i.e. Muhammad) whom they find written with them in the Tauraat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel) — he commands them for Al-Ma‘roof (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam has ordained); and forbids them from Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism of all kinds, and all that Islam has forbidden); he allows them as lawful At-Tayyibaat (i.e. all good and lawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods), and prohibits them as unlawful Al-Khabaa’ith (i.e. all evil and unlawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods), he releases them from their heavy burdens (of Allah’s Covenant with the children of Israel), and from the fetters (bindings) that were upon them. So those who believe in him (Muhammad), honour him, help him, and follow the light (the Quran) which has been sent down with him, it is they who will be successful” [al-A’raaf 7:157]
It is also one of the basic principles of belief in Islam that the Message of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is addressed to all of mankind. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And We have not sent you (O Muhammad) except as a giver of glad tidings and a warner to all mankind, but most of men know not” [Saba’ 34:28]
“Say (O Muhammad): “O mankind! Verily, I am sent to you all as the Messenger of Allah” [al-A’raaf 7:158].
And there are many similar aayaat.


(5)One of the basic principles of belief in Islam is that we must believe that every Jew, Christian or other person who does not enter Islam is a kaafir, and that those against whom proof is established must be named as kaafirs and regarded as enemies of Allah, His Messenger and the believers, and that they are the people of Hell, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):


“Those who disbelieve from among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) and Al-Mushrikoon, were not going to leave (their disbelief) until there came to them clear evidence” [al-Bayyinah 98:1]
“Verily, those who disbelieve (in the religion of Islâm, the Qur’ân and Prophet Muhammad) from among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) and Al-Mushrikoon will abide in the fire of Hell. They are the worst of creatures” [al-Bayyinah 98:6]
“This Quran has been revealed to me that I may therewith warn you and whomsoever it may reach” [al-An’aam 6:19]
“This (Quran) is a Message for mankind (and a clear proof against them), in order that they may be warned thereby” [Ibraaheem 14:52]. And there are many similar aayaat. It was reported in Saheeh Muslim that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “By the One in Whose hand is my soul, no one among this nation, Jew or Christian, hears of me, then dies without having believed in that with which I was sent, but he will be one of the people of the Fire.” Hence whoever does not regard the Jews and Christians as kuffaar is himself a kaafir, according to the ruling of Sharee’ah, “Whoever does not regard the kaafir as such after proof has been established against him is himself a kaafir.”


(6)In the light of these basic principles of belief and the rulings of sharee’ah, calling for the uniting of all religions, and for them to be brought close to one another and cast in the same mould, is an evil and crafty call whose aim is to mix truth with falsehood, to destroy Islam and undermine its pillars, and to tempt its followers into total apostasy. This is confirmed by the words of the Quran (interpretation of the meaning):


“And they will never cease fighting you until they turn you back from your religion (Islamic Monotheism) if they can” [al-Baqarah 2:217]
“They wish that you reject Faith, as they have rejected (Faith), and thus that you all become equal (like one another)” [al-Nisaa’ 4:89]


(7)Among the effects of this evil call would be the cancelling out of the differences between Islam and kufr, truth and falsehood, good and evil. It would break down the psychological barrier that exists between the Muslims and the kaafirs, and there would be no sense of al-Walaa’ wa’l-Baraa’ (loyalty and friendship towards Muslims, disavowal and enmity towards kaafirs), or jihaad and fighting to make the word of Allah supreme in the earth of Allah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):


“Fight against those who (1) believe not in Allah, (2) nor in the Last Day, (3) nor forbid that which has been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger(Muhammad( (4) and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth (i.e. Islâm) among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), until they pay the Jizyah with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued” [al-Tawbah 9:29]
“and fight against the Mushrikoon (polytheists, pagans, idolaters, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah) collectively as they fight against you collectively. But know that Allah is with those who are Al-Muttaqoon (the pious)” [al-Tawbah 9:36]
“O you who believe! Take not as (your) Bitaanah (advisors, consultants, protectors, helpers, friends) those outside your religion (pagans, Jews, Christians, and hypocrites) since they will not fail to do their best to corrupt you. They desire to harm you severely. Hatred has already appeared from their mouths, but what their breasts conceal is far worse. Indeed We have made plain to you the Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses) if you understand” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:118]


(8)If the call to unite the religions is made by a Muslim, this considered to be blatant apostasy from the religion of Islam, because it conflicts with the basic principles of belief. It is an acceptance of disbelief in Allah and a contradiction of the truth of the Quran and its abrogation of all laws and religions that came before it. On this basis, it is an idea that should be rejected from the point of view of sharee’ah, and it is definitely haraam according to the evidence of Islam, Quran, Sunnah and ijmaa’ (scholarly consensus).


(9)Based on the above:


(i)It is not permissible for a Muslim who believes in Allah as his Lord, Islam as his religion and Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) as his Prophet and Messenger, to call people to this evil idea, to encourage it or to propagate it among the Muslims, let alone respond to it or join the conferences and gatherings held to promote it.


(ii)It is not permissible for a Muslim to print the Tawraat and Injeel on their own, so how about printing them with the Quran in one volume? Whoever does this or calls for it is far astray, because by doing so he is combining truth (the Quran) with that which is either distorted or was true but has now been abrogated (the Tawraat and Injeel).


(iii)Similarly, it is not permissible for a Muslim to respond to the call to build a mosque, church and synagogue in one place, because this involves recognizing a religion in which Allah is worshipped other than Islam, and rejecting the idea that Islam should prevail over all other religions, and giving the idea that there are three religions and that it is OK for people to belong to any of these three. This is a kind of equality which implies that Islam does not abrogate the religions that came before it. Undoubtedly, if a person approves of this, believes it or accepts it, this is kufr and misguidance, because it clearly goes against the Quran, the Sunnah and the consensus (ijmaa’) of the Muslims and implies that the distortions of the Jews and Christians come from Allah – exalted be He far above that. By the same token, it is not permitted to call churches “Houses of God” or to say that the people there are worshipping Allah in a correct and acceptable manner, because this worship is not done according to the religion of Islam, and Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):


“And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:85].
On the contrary, they are houses in which disbelief (kufr) in Allah is expressed; we seek refuge with Allah from kufr and its people. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Majmoo’ al-Fataawaa (22/162): “They – churches and synagogues – are not houses of Allah; the houses of Allah are the mosques. On the contrary, they are houses in which disbelief (kufr) in Allah is expressed. Even if Allah is mentioned therein, houses are the same as the people in them, and the people in these houses are kuffaar, so they are the houses of worship of the kuffaar.”


(10)It should be noted that it is obligatory on the Muslims to call the kuffaar in general, and the People of the Book in particular, to Islam through the clear texts of the Quran and Sunnah. But this is only to be done by explaining to them and arguing with them in a way that is better (with good words and in a good manner) (cf. Al-‘Ankaboot 29:46), not by compromising any of the beliefs of laws of Islam. This is in order to convince them about Islam and bring them into the religion, or to establish proof against them so that those who are to be destroyed (for their rejecting the Faith) might be destroyed after a clear evidence, and those who are to live (i.e. believers) might live after a clear evidence (cf. Al-Anfaal 8:42). Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):


“Say (O Muhammad ): “O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians): Come to a word that is just between us and you, that we worship none but Allah (Alone), and that we associate no partners with Him, and that none of us shall take others as lords besides Allah. Then, if they turn away, say: “Bear witness that we are Muslims.” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:64]
As for debating and meeting with them in order to go along with their wishes and fulfil their aims of destroying Islam bit by bit, this is falsehood which is rejected by Allah, His Messenger and the believers, and Allah is the One Whose help is sought against all that they ascribe to Him. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“but beware of them lest they turn you (O Muhammad) far away from some of that which Allah has sent down to you” [al-Maa’idah 5:49]
The Committee has made the above statement to the people. We advise the Muslims in general, and people of knowledge in particular, to fear Allah and be aware that He is always watching, to guard Islam and to protect the ‘aqeedah (belief) of the Muslims from misguidance and those who promote it and from kufr and its people, and to beware of this idea.",Islam Q&A - Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

Please advise me, may Allah reward you with good.",,,"Praise be to Allah.You have to repent from the sins and exhort your brothers against them. It is not permissible for you to continue committing the sin and not to advise your brothers, because by doing this you are combining two sins.

This does not make you a hypocrite, but it does place you in a category which is condemned as blameworthy by Allah in the aayaat (interpretation of the meaning):

Hence we earnestly hope that you can do us the favour of writing to us a letter in which you tell us the answer to this problem, with evidence (daleel) and proof. I have told many of them about how serious this matter is, but I cannot do much and I do not have deep knowledge, so I failed to convince them despite my repeated attempts.",,,"Praise be to Allah.One of the essential aims of sharee’ah is to protect people’s lineage and honour. For this reason, Allah has forbidden zinaa and ordered that it be punished by whipping or stoning. And He has forbidden the means that may lead to zinaa, such as a man being alone with a non-mahram woman, sinful looks, and women travelling without a mahram or going out of their homes wearing perfume and make-up, clothed yet naked, seeking thus to attract young men and provoke their desires and tempt them away from their religious commitment. This also includes a man speaking to a woman in a deceitful manner, and her speaking to him in a soft voice so as to tempt him and provoke his desire, so that he will fall in her trap – whether this is done in person, over the phone, via correspondence or in some other manner. For this reason, Allah forbade the wives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), even though they were good and pure, to make a display of themselves in the manner of the first Jaahiliyyah, or to speak in soft voices so as to provoke the desire of those in whose hearts was a disease; and He commanded them to speak in a manner that was honourable. Allah said (interpretation of the meaning):
“O wives of the Prophet! You are not like any other women. If you keep your duty (to Allâh), then be not soft in speech, lest he in whose heart is a disease (of hypocrisy, or evil desire for adultery) should be moved with desire, but speak in an honourable manner.
And stay in your houses, and do not display yourselves like that of the times of ignorance…” [al-Ahzaab 33:31-32]
 So Muslim youths must fear Allah, protect their chastity and lower their gaze. They should refrain from speaking or writing any obscene words of immoral romance or deceit. Muslim girls are obliged to do likewise, to remain chaste and not to go out wearing make-up, clothed yet naked.
 It was reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There are two types of the people of Hell that I have not seen yet: men with whips like the tails of cattle, with which they strike the people, and women who are clothed yet naked, walking with an enticing gait, with something on their heads that looks like the humps of camels, leaning to one side. They will never enter Paradise or even smell its fragrance, although its fragrance can be detected from such and such a distance.” (Narrated by Ahmad and by Muslim in al-Saheeh).
 If young men and women obey Allah and His Messenger, and rise above worldly matters, keeping away from fitnah and sources of suspicion, that will be better for them, purer for their hearts and better for their reputations and their societies.

Be patient in bearing their insults and harm, and do not let their insults deter you from carrying out your duty towards them, which is to enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil. This is the way of Allah concerning the callers and those who are called. Allah has explained that in the aayah where He tells us that Luqmaan said to his son (interpretation of the meaning):
“O my son! Aqim-is-Salaat (perform As-Salaah), enjoin (on people) Al-Ma‘roof(Islamic Monotheism and all that is good), and forbid (people) from Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief in the Oneness of Allah, polytheism of all kinds and all that is evil and bad), and bear with patience whatever befalls you.

10232,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10232,Ruling on the call for closeness and reconciliation between religions,"Here in America we are trying as best we can to call people to Allaah according to the way of the Pious Predecessors (al-salaf al-saalih). Recently there has emerged a very serious matter, which is the spread of committees to bring together the three heavenly religions – Islam, Christianity and Judaism – whereby each group sends a representative to try to bridge the gaps between these three religions and bring them closer together. They meet in churches and synagogues, and even pray together, as happened following the massacre in al-Khaleel (“Hebron”) in Palestine. These meetings are attended by a not insignificant number of followers from these three religions.
Our question is: the Muslims are represented by scholars – or by people who are counted as being scholars – and there has arisen among us an argument as to the ruling on attending meetings such as these, where Muslim scholars shake hands with and embrace priests and monks. There is no opportunity for da’wah in these meetings; they are held in the name of bringing these three religion closer together. Is it permissible for a Muslim who believes in Allaah and the Last Day to attend such meetings, to enter churches and synagogues and to greet and embrace a priest or monk? For your information, this phenomenon has spread across America, and we hope that you can send us the solution, because we have agreed to accept your ruling between us to suppress this fitnah that exists at the national level. Wa’l-salaamu ‘alaykum wa rahmat-Allaahi wa barakaatuhu.",,,"Praise be to Allah.After studying the matter, the Committee for Issuing Fatwas responds as follows: 
Firstly: 
The basic principles of faith with which Allaah revealed His Books – the Tawraat (Torah), Injeel (Gospel) and Qur’aan – to His Messengers, and to which His Messengers – peace be upon them – Ibraaheem, Moosa, ‘Eesaa and other Prophets and Messengers – called mankind, are all the same. The earlier Messengers foretold the coming of those yet to come, and the later Messengers confirmed what their forbears had said, supporting them and pointing out their importance. The details of their laws differed according to the circumstances, times and interests of the people, by the wisdom and justice of Allaah and as a mercy and a favour from Him. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The Messenger (Muhammad) believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers. Each one believes in Allaah, His Angels, His Books, and His Messengers. (They say,) ‘We make no distinction between one another of His Messengers’ — and they say, ‘We hear, and we obey. (We seek) Your forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the return (of all).’” [al-Baqarah 2:285]
“And those who believe in Allaah and His Messengers and make no distinction between any of them (Messengers), We shall give them their rewards; and Allaah is Ever Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful” [al-Nisa’ 4:152] 
“And (remember) when Allaah took the Covenant of the Prophets, saying: ‘Take whatever I gave you from the Book and Hikmah (understanding of the Laws of Allaah), and afterwards there will come to you a Messenger (Muhammad ) confirming what is with you; you must, then, believe in him and help him.’ Allaah said: ‘Do you agree (to it) and will you take up My Covenant (which I conclude with you)?’ They said: ‘We agree.’ He said: ‘Then bear witness; and I am with you among the witnesses (for this).’
Then whoever turns away after this, they are the Faasiqoon (rebellious: those who turn away from Allaah’s obedience).
Do they seek other than the religion of Allaah (the true Islamic Monotheism worshipping none but Allaah Alone), while to Him submitted all creatures in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly. And to Him shall they all be returned.
Say (O Muhammad ): ‘We believe in Allaah and in what has been sent down to us, and what was sent down to Ibraaheem (Abraham), Ismaa‘eel (Ishmael), Ishaaq (Isaac), Ya’qoob (Jacob) and Al-Asbaat [the offspring of the twelve sons of Ya’qoob (Jacob)] and what was given to Moosa (Moses), ‘Eesaa (Jesus) and the Prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between one another among them and to Him (Allaah) we have submitted (in Islam).’
And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers”
[Aal- ‘Imraan 3:81-85]
After mentioning the call of His close friend (khaleel) Ibraaheem, and the Messengers who were with him, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“They are those whom We gave the Book, Al‑Hukm (understanding of the religious laws), and Prophethood. But if these disbelieve therein (the Book, Al‑Hukm and Prophethood), then, indeed We have entrusted it to a people (such as the Companions of Prophet Muhammad ) who are not disbelievers therein.
They are those whom Allaah had guided. So follow their guidance. Say: ‘No reward I ask of you for this (the Qur’aan). It is only a reminder for the ‘aalameen (mankind and jinn).’”
[al-An’aam 6:89-90]
“Verily, among mankind who have the best claim to Ibraaheem (Abraham) are those who followed him, and this Prophet (Muhammad) and those who have believed (Muslims). And Allaah is the Walee (Protector and Helper) of the believers
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:68]
“Then, We have sent the Revelation to you (O Muhammad saying): “Follow the religion of Ibraaheem (Abraham) Haneef (Islamic Monotheism — to worship none but Allaah) and he was not of the Mushrikoon (polytheists, idolaters, disbelievers).
[al-Nahl 16:123]
“And (remember) when ‘Eesaa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), said: ‘O Children of Israel! I am the Messenger of Allaah unto you, confirming the Tawraat [(Torah) which came] before me, and giving glad tidings of a Messenger to come after me, whose name shall be Ahmad’”
[al-Saff 61:6] 
“And We have sent down to you (O Muhammad) the Book (this Qur’aan) in truth, confirming the Scripture that came before it and Mohaymin (trustworthy in highness and a witness) over it (old Scriptures). So judge among them by what Allaah has revealed, and follow not their vain desires, diverging away from the truth that has come to you. To each among you, We have prescribed a law and a clear way”
[al-Maa’idah 5:48]
It was reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:  
“I am the closest of mankind to ‘Eesaa ibn Maryam in this world and in the Hereafter. The Prophets are like brothers (from one father), their mothers are different but their religion is one.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari). 
Secondly: 
The Jews and Christians deliberately distorted the meanings, and replaced words with others which were not said to them. In this way they changed the basic principles of their religion and altered the laws of their Lord. For example, the Jews said “‘Uzair (Ezra) is the son of Allaah” [al-tawbah 9:30 – interpretation of the meaning]; they claimed that Allaah got tired after creating the heavens and the earth and everything between them in six days, so He rested on the Sabbath day; they claimed that they crucified ‘Eesaa (peace be upon him) and killed him; they tricked their way into allowing fishing on the Sabbath, which Allaah had forbidden for them; they abolished the punishment for zinaa; they said “Allaah’s Hand is tied up (i.e. He does not give and spend of His Bounty)” [al-Maa’idah 5:64 – interpretation of the meaning]; and other ways in which they altered and distorted their religion in theory and in practice, even though they knew what they were doing, following their own desires. The Christians claimed that the Messiah ‘Eesaa (peace be upon him) was the son of God, or even that he was a god alongside Allaah; they confirmed the Jews’ claim to have crucified ‘Eesaa (peace be upon him) and killed him. Both groups claimed to be the sons of God and beloved by Him; they disbelieved in Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and in the message he brought, and they hated him out of jealousy. But Allaah had taken a pledge from them that they would believe in him and support him. And there are other scandalous contradictions on the part of both groups. Allaah has told us about many of their lies and fabrications, and how they have distorted the doctrines and laws which Allaah had revealed to them. Allaah exposed them and refuted them in His Book. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Then woe to those who write the Book with their own hands and then say, ‘This is from Allaah,’ to purchase with it a little price! Woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for that they earn thereby.
And they (Jews) say, ‘The Fire (i.e. Hell-fire on the Day of Resurrection) shall not touch us but for a few numbered days.’ Say (O Muhammad  to them): ‘Have you taken a covenant from Allaah, so that Allaah will not break His Covenant? Or is it that you say of Allaah what you know not?’” [al-Baqarah 2:79-80] 
“And they say, ‘None shall enter Paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian.’ These are their own desires. Say (O Muhammad ), ‘Produce your proof if you are truthful.’ [al-Baqarah 2:111] 
“And they say, “Be Jews or Christians, then you will be guided.” Say (to them O Muhammad ), “Nay, (we follow) only the religion of Ibraaheem (Abraham), Haneef [Islamic Monotheism, i.e. to worship none but Allaah (Alone)], and he was not of Al-Mushrikoon (those who worshipped others along with Allaah).”
Say (O Muslims): “We believe in Allaah and that which has been sent down to us and that which has been sent down to Ibraaheem (Abraham), Ismaa’eel (Ishmael), Ishaaq (Isaac), Ya’qoob (Jacob), and to Al-Asbaat [the offspring of the twelve sons of Ya’qoob (Jacob)], and that which has been given to Moosa (Moses) and ‘Eesaa (Jesus), and that which has beengiven to the Prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and to Him we have submitted (in Islam).”  [al-Baqarah 2:135-136]
“And verily, among them is a party who distort the Book with their tongues (as they read), so that you may think it is from the Book, but it is not from the Book, and they say: ‘This is from Allaah,’ but it is not from Allaah; and they speak a lie against Allaah while they know it
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:78]
“Because of their breaking the covenant, and of their rejecting the Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allaah, and of their killing the Prophets unjustly, and of their saying: ‘Our hearts are wrapped (with coverings, i.e. we do not understand what the Messengers say)’ — nay, Allaah has set a seal upon their hearts because of their disbelief, so they believe not but a little.
And because of their (Jews) disbelief and uttering against Maryam (Mary) a grave false charge (that she has committed illegal sexual intercourse);
And because of their saying (in boast), ‘We killed Messiah ‘Eesaa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), the Messenger of Allaah,’ — but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but it appeared so to them the resemblance of ‘Eesaa (Jesus) was put over another man (and they killed that man)], and those who differ therein are full of doubts. They have no (certain) knowledge, they follow nothing but conjecture. For surely; they killed him not [i.e. ‘Eesaa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary)]:
But Allaah raised him [‘Eesaa (Jesus)] up (with his body and soul) unto Himself (and he is in the heavens). And Allaah is Ever All‑Powerful,All‑Wise.”
 [al-Nisaa’ 4:155-158]
“And (both) the Jews and the Christians say: ‘We are the children of Allaah and His loved ones.’ Say: ‘Why then does He punish you for your sins?’ Nay, you are but human beings of those He has created…”
[al-Maa’idah 5:18]
“And the Jews say: ‘Uzair (Ezra) is the son of Allaah, and the Christians say: Messiah is the son of Allaah. That is their saying with their mouths, resembling the saying of those who disbelieved aforetime. Allaah’s Curse be on them, how they are deluded away from the truth!
They (Jews and Christians) took their rabbis and their monks to be their lords besides Allaah (by obeying them in things which they made lawful or unlawful according to their own desires without being ordered by Allaah), and (they also took as their Lord) Messiah, son of Maryam (Mary), while they (Jews and Christians) were commanded [in the Tawraat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] to worship none but One Ilâh (God — Allaah) Laa ilaaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He). Praise and glory be to Him (far above is He) from having the partners they associate (with Him).”
[al-Tawbah 9:30-31]
“Many of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) wish that if they could turn you away as disbelievers after you have believed, out of envy from their ownselves, even after the truth (that Muhammad  is Allaah’s Messenger) has become manifest unto them”
[al-Baqarah 2:109]
-- and there are other outrageous statements and shameless fabrications which never cease to amaze and astound. We have mentioned some examples of what they do as a basis for the following response. 
Thirdly: 
On the basis of the above, it is clear that the basic foundation of the laws and religions that Allaah has prescribed for His slaves is one and there is no need to bring them close to one another. It is obvious that the Jews and Christians have distorted and twisted that which was revealed to them from their Lord, to the point that their religions have become falsehood, kufr and misguidance. Because of that Allaah sent Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to them and to other nations in general, to make clear what truth they were hiding and to make known what they were concealing, and to correct the beliefs and laws that they had corrupted, and to guide them and others to the straight path. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Now has come to you Our Messenger (Muhammad ) explaining to you much of that which you used to hide from the Scripture and pass over (i.e. leaving out without explaining) much. Indeed, there has come to you from Allaah a light (Prophet Muhammad  ) and a plain Book (this Qur’aan).
Wherewith Allaah guides all those who seek His Good Pleasure to ways of peace, and He brings them out of darkness by His Will unto light and guides them to the Straight Way (Islamic Monotheism).”
[al-Maa’idah 5:15-16]
“O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Now has come to you Our Messenger (Muhammad ) making (things) clear unto you, after a break in (the series of) Messengers, lest you say: ‘There came unto us no bringer of glad tidings and no warner.’ But now has come unto you a bringer of glad tidings and a warner. And Allaah is Able to do all things.”
[al-Maa’idah 5:19]
But they resisted the truth and turned away from it in sin, enmity and jealousy, after the truth had become clear to them. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Many of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) wish that if they could turn you away as disbelievers after you have believed, out of envy from their ownselves, even after the truth (that Muhammad  is Allaah’s Messenger) has become manifest unto them”
[al-Baqarah 2:109]
“And when there came to them (the Jews), a Book (this Qur’aan) from Allaah confirming what is with them [the Tawraat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)], although aforetime they had invoked Allaah (for coming of Muhammad ) in order to gain victory over those who disbelieved, then when there came to them that which they had recognized, they disbelieved in it. So let the Curse of Allaah be on the disbelievers.”
[al-Baqarah 2:89]
“And when there came to them a Messenger from Allaah (i.e. Muhammad) confirming what was with them, a party of those who were given the Scripture threw away the Book of Allaah behind their backs as if they did not know!
[al-Baqarah 2:101]
“Those who disbelieve from among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) and Al‑Mushrikoon, were not going to leave (their disbelief) until there came to them clear evidence.
A Messenger (Muhammad ) from Allaah, reciting (the Qur’aan) purified pages [purified from Al‑Baatil (falsehood)].”
[al-Bayyinah 98:1-2]
How can any rational person who knows about their persistence in falsehood and their continuing to knowingly follow misguidance out of jealousy and their pursuit of their own desires, hope for a closer relationship between them and the truly believing Muslims? Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Do you (faithful believers) covet that they will believe in your religion inspite of the fact that a party of them (Jewish rabbis) used to hear the Word of Allaah [the Tawraat (Torah)], then they used to change it knowingly after they understood it?
[al-Baqarah 2:75]
“Verily, We have sent you (O Muhammad ) with the truth (Islam), a bringer of glad tidings (for those who believe in what you brought, that they will enter Paradise) and a warner (for those who disbelieve in what you brought, that they will enter the Hell-fire).And you will not be asked about the dwellers of the blazing Fire.
Never will the Jews nor the Christians be pleased with you (O Muhammad) till you follow their religion. Say: ‘Verily, the Guidance of Allaah (i.e. Islamic Monotheism) that is the (only) Guidance. And if you (O Muhammad) were to follow their (Jews and Christians) desires after what you have received of Knowledge (i.e. the Qur’aan), then you would have against Allaah neither any Walee (protector or guardian) nor any helper.”
[al-Baqarah 2:119-120]
“How shall Allaah guide a people who disbelieved after their Belief and after they bore witness that the Messenger (Muhammad ) is true and after clear proofs had come unto them? And Allaah guides not the people who are Zaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers).”
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:86]
Even though they may not be worse in kufr and enmity towards Allaah than their fellow mushrikeen, they are still like them. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So (O Muhammad ) obey you not the deniers [(of Islamic Monotheism __ those who belie the Verses of Allaah), the Oneness of Allaah, and the Messengership of Muhammad  ].
They wish that you should compromise (in religion out of courtesy) with them, so they (too) would compromise with you
[al-Qalam 68:8-9]
“Say (O Muhammad  to these Mushrikoon and Kaafiroon): ‘O Al‑Kaafiroon (disbelievers in Allaah, in His Oneness, in His Angels, in His Books,  in His Messengers, in the Day of Resurrection, and in Al‑Qadar)!
I worship not that which you worship,
Nor will you worship that which I worship.
And I shall not worship that which you are worshipping.
Nor will you worship that which I worship.
To you be your religion, and to me my religion (Islamic Monotheism).’”
[al-Kaafiroon 109:1-6]
The person who thinks of bringing Islam, Judaism and Christianity together, or bringing them closer to one another, is like one who strives to bring together the opposites of truth and falsehood, kufr (disbelief) and eemaan (faith). There is nothing like this except what the poet described: 
“O you who want Thurayyah (Pleiades) to marry Suhayl (Canopus) [names of stars and constellations], for Allaah’s sake, how could they meet?
She appears in the north (lit. the direction of Syria) when she rises, and Suhayl when he rises appears in the south (lit. the direction of Yemen)!” 
Moreover, the religion of the Jews and Christians has been abrogated by Allaah when He sent the Messenger Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and Allaah obliged all the people of the  earth, Jews Christians and others, to follow him. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Those who follow the Messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor write (i.e. Muhammad) whom they find written with them in the Tauraat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel) — he commands them for Al-Ma‘roof (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam has ordained); and forbids them from Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism of all kinds, and all that Islam has forbidden); he allows them as lawful At‑Tayyibaat (i.e. all good and lawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods), andprohibits them as unlawful Al‑Khabaa’ith (i.e. all evil and unlawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods), he releases them from their heavy burdens (of Allaah’s Covenant with the children of Israel), and from the fetters (bindings) that were upon them. So those who believe in him (Muhammad ), honour him, help him, and follow the light (the Qur’aan) which has been sent down with him, it is they who will be successful.
Say (O Muhammad): “O mankind! Verily, I am sent to you all as the Messenger of Allaah — to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. Laa ilaaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He). It is He Who gives life and causes death. So believe in Allaah and His Messenger (Muhammad ), the Prophet who can neither read nor write (i.e. Muhammad ), who believes in Allaah and His Words [(this Qur’aan), the Tauraat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel) and also Allaah’s Word: “Be!” — and he was, i.e. ‘Eesaa (Jesus) son of Maryam (Mary)], and follow him so that you may be guided.”
[al-A’raaf 7:157-158]
If they persist in following their religion, which has been abrogated, then they are adhering to falsehood, not to true religion. So it is not permissible for the Muslims to get close to them, because by getting close to them they are approving of their falsehood on the one hand, and misleading the ignorant, on the other. What Muslims should do is expose their falsehood just as Allaah has exposed them in the Qur’aan. And Allaah knows best. 
Fourthly: 
Someone might say: can there not be a truce among them, or a peace treaty, so as to avoid bloodshed and the tragedies of war, and so that people may go about their business and earn a living, and that the world may be developed so that the call to truth and guidance may be given to all people, and so that justice may be established among all people? If someone were to say this, it is fair enough, and any efforts to achieve this would be valuable, for it is a noble aim, because it is possible and it would have a great impact on people. But this applies only when it is not possible to enforce the jizyah system, because Allaah says in Soorat al-Tawbah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Fight against those who (1) believe not in Allaah, (2) nor in the Last Day, (3) nor forbid that which has been forbidden by Allaah and His Messenger  (Muhammad), (4) and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth (i.e. Islam) among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), until they pay the Jizyah with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued”
[al-Tawbah 9:29]
At the same time, we must also make sure that we are striving to support the truth. This should not be an attempt on the part of the Muslims to appease the mushrikeen or to give up any of the rulings of Allaah, or anything that would entail their compromising their own dignity. The Muslims must retain their pride and their adherence to the Book of their Lord and the Sunnah of their Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him); they must continue to hate their enemies of Allaah and not befriend them, following the guidance of the Qur’aan and of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“But if they incline to peace, you also incline to it, and (put your) trust in Allaah. Verily, He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower” [al-Anfaal 8:61]
“So do not become weak (against your enemy), nor be sad, and you will be superior (in victory) if you are indeed (true) believers.
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:139] 
“So be not weak and ask not for peace (from the enemies of Islam) while you are having the upper hand. Allaah is with you, and He will never decrease the reward of your good deeds’
[Muhammad 47:35]
Our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) explained that by his actions, and achieved it in his dealings with Quraysh in the year of (the treaty of) al-Hudaybiyah, with the Jews in Madeenah before al-Khandaq and in the campaign of Khaybar, and with the Christians in the campaign of Tabook. Hence it had the great effect of bringing peace and security for everyone. Truth prevailed, he gained power in the land, people entered the religion of Allaah in crowds, and everyone was able to strive for his worldly and spiritual interests.  This was a time of prosperity and power, when Islam and peace spread. History and real life provide stronger evidence and a more eloquent testimony to that effect, for those who are open-minded and objective, and who are free from tribalistic and argumentative thought. In that there is a reminder for the one who has a heart or gives ear while he is heedful (cf. Qaaf 50:37). And Allaah is the Guide to the Straight Path; He is Sufficient for us and He is the Best disposer of affairs.","Al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 12/284-297"

Boxing for jihad","Praise be to Allah.Physical strength is a blessing from Allah 
We praise Allah for guiding the brother who asked this question, and we ask Allah to make him steadfast in his religion. And we praise Him for giving you physical strength, in which there is a great deal of good for you and for the Muslims in sha Allah, because the Muslims strengthen and support one another. 
Physical strength is a blessing from Allah and a gift from Him which He bestows upon whomsoever He wills and withholds from whomsoever He wills.  
The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) preferred a strong believer to a weak one; this includes both strength of faith and physical strength.
Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The strong believer is better and more beloved to Allah than the weak believer, although both are good. Strive to do that which will benefit you and seek the help of Allah. Do not feel helpless and if anything befalls you, do not say ‘If only I had done such and such.’ Rather say, ‘Qadar Allah wa ma sha-a kan (The decree of Allah and whatever He wills happens).’ For (the words) ‘If only’ open the door to the Shaytan.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2664) 
Ruling on sports in Islam
It is very good for the believer to engage in permissible sports so that he will be physically strong and will preserve his health, which will help him to do acts of worship and strive in jihad for the sake of Allah. 
The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) praised good health and even regarded it as more important than money. 
It was narrated from Mu'adh ibn ‘Abd-Allah ibn Khubayb from his father that his paternal uncle said: “We were sitting in a gathering when the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came, with traces of water on his head. One of us said, ‘We see that you appear to be in high spirits today.’ He said, ‘Yes, praise be to Allah.’ Then the people spoke about riches. He said, ‘There is nothing wrong with riches for one who fears Allah, but good health is better for one who fears Allah than riches, and being in good spirits is a blessing.’” (Narrated by Ibn Majah, 2141; Ahmad, 22076. This hadith was classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah, no. 1741) 
Aims of playing sports in Islam
The Muslim’s aim in playing sports should be to strengthen himself to do acts of worship and to support the religion of Allah, to defend His sacred limits and to protect the honour of the Muslims. 
If that is not the case, then at the very least he should aim to earn himself a living in this world, protect himself from enemies or use his physical strength to earn a living, so that it will be a means of him eating from what he earns with his own hands. 
Al-Miqdam (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No man eats better food than the one who earns it with his own hands. The Prophet of Allah Dawud (peace be upon him) used to eat from what he earned with his own hands. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1966) 
Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “For one of you to chop wood and carry it on his back is better for him than asking (begging) from anyone who will either give him something or refuse to give him anything.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1968; Muslim, 1042)
Is boxing haram?
This is with regard to permissible kinds of sports. But from what we see nowadays, most sports have gone beyond that and are no longer permissible; they have become haram, especially boxing which is the worst of sports, for the following reasons: 

It involves attacking the face, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If any one of you has a fight with his brother, let him avoid the face.” (Al-Bukhari, 2560; Muslim, 2612). This game is based on hitting the face of one's opponent with the strongest blow the boxer can muster. 
It is a waste of time. Allah has bestowed many blessings upon the Muslim, and He will question him about them on the Day of Resurrection. But people think little of these blessings and waste many of them such as good health and free time. One of the things that Allah will question the Muslim about on the Day when he meets Him will be his youth and what he did with it, and his life and how he spent it. What will this man say who spent his youth and his life training to fight people and wrestle with them and box with them in order to gain a title or win a prize? 

Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said:
“If a person should not waste his money on things that are of no benefit, it is even more important that he not waste his time, because time is more precious than money, and because the fact that the young and the not-so-young waste their time on these sorts of games that are of no benefit to them is something that is very unfortunate and regrettable.” (Fatawa Islamiyyah, 4/435) 

It is a harmful sport which can lead to irreparable damage, and Allah has forbidden us to harm our bodies, which He has commanded us to preserve and protect. 

‘Ubadah ibn al-Samit narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) decreed that there should be no harm or reciprocation of harm. (Narrated by Ibn Majah, 2340; Ahmad, 21714; this hadith was classed as sahih by Imam Ahmad and al-Hakim, and as hasan by Ibn al-Salah) (See Khalasat al-Badr al-Munir, by Ibn al-Mulaqqin, 2/438)
Because of your practising this sport, you know that there are many boxers who have been permanently injured, especially with damage to the brain and nerves.  

It involves wasting money and wasting people’s time with something that is of no benefit. Instead of being wasted on this useless entertainment, that money could have been spent on charitable causes. How many millions are wasted that could have been spent on feeding the hungry, building a mosque, opening a school or other good works? 
These sports – including boxing – have become an excuse for tribalism and nationalism. Sport, as it exists nowadays, has divided people and made people love or hate one another on the basis of the victory or defeat of a team.
It involves uncovering the ‘awrah, even if you do not do that, your opponent will. The man's ‘awrah is from the navel to the knee, as was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 

Similarly, it involves uncovering of the spectators’ ‘awrahs, both men and women. This is something that you cannot ward off or even denounce them for.
You say in your question that you will not fight Muslims, but will the people who organize the matches allow you that? I don’t think so, and you know better than we do. 
Boxing for Islam: Possible?
These fights are not held for the sake of religion, and they are not based on that. When people watch a fight, they do not think that this is a fight between Islam and disbelief. 
Moreover, when you fight, you will be fighting in the name of the country where you live, or which has given you its nationality; they will not allow you to fight in the name of Islam. 
And even if your opponent is a disbeliever, he may be from among the people with whom there is peace (ahl al-silm), not those who are in a state of war with the Muslims (ahl al-harb), so what right do you have to raise your hand against a man who is at peace with us? 
In conclusion, this sport is one of the haraam games that causes more harm than good. 
Boxing for jihad
With regard to your saying that you intend to go for jihad one day. 
These are beautiful words, even if boxing is haram. You can strengthen your body by doing other sports that are not haram.

Most of the scholars say that it is 
    permissible to be married to a woman and her stepdaughter at the same time. ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Ja’far and Safwaan ibn Umayyah did that. This is the 
    view of all the fuqaha’ apart from al-Hasan, ‘Ikrimah and Ibn Abi Layla; it was narrated that they regarded it as makrooh. 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“All others are lawful”
[al-Nisa’ 4:24]
And because they are not related, they are like two strangers. And because marrying two 
    closely-related women at the same time is forbidden lest there be a severing of family ties between those who are closely related. There is no 
    such relationship between these two, so their case is different from what has been mentioned.
Al-Mughni, 7/98 
Based on this, then the wife of your wife’s 
    father is not counted as one of your mahrams, rather she is a “stranger” to you, so you may not shake hands with her or be alone with her or

·One day a man from among the Children of Israel sought Moosa’s help against his enemy. Moosa struck him with his fist and killed him (cf. al-Qasas 28:15). Then Moosa regretted it, and sought the forgiveness of his Lord, and He forgave him. Then he became afraid, looking about in the city (waiting to see the result of his crime of killing) (cf. al-Qasas 28:18). The next day, Moosa found that man fighting another enemy. He asked Moosa to help him again, and Moosa became angry with him. The man thought that he was going to kill him, so he said to him: 
“ ‘Is it your intention to kill me as you killed a man yesterday?””
[al-Qasas 28:19] 
·That enemy told the people of Pharaoh about that, and they started to look for him in order to kill him. A righteous man came and told Moosa what the people were plotting against him. He advised him to leave Egypt: 
“So he escaped from there, looking about in a state of fear. He said: ‘My Lord! Save me from the people who are Zaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers)!’”[al-Qasas 28:21] 
·Moosa headed for the land of Madyan (Midian), where he married the daughter of a noble shaykh in return for working for him for eight years. When that time was over, Moosa travelled with his family towards Egypt. When he came to al-Toor (Mount Sinai), Allaah wanted to single him out, to honour him with Prophethood and to speak with him. Moosa lost his way, then he saw a fire… 
“… he said to his family: ‘Wait! Verily, I have seen a fire; perhaps I can bring you some burning brand therefrom, or find some guidance at the fire.’
And when he came to it (the fire), he was called by name: ‘O Moosa (Moses)!
Verily, I am your Lord! So take off your shoes; you are in the sacred valley, Tuwa.
And I have chosen you. So listen to that which will be revealed (to you).
Verily, I am Allaah! Laa ilaaha illa Ana (none has the right to be worshipped but I), so worship Me, and perform As‑Salaah (Iqaamat‑as‑Salaah) for My remembrance.
Verily, the Hour is coming and I am almost hiding it that every person may be rewarded for that which he strives”[Ta-Ha 20:10-15] 
·Then Allaah showed him some of the miracles. He commanded him to throw his stick on the ground, and it turned into a snake; then to put his hand into his garment, and it came out white. Then He told him to go with these two miracles to Pharaoh, so that he might accept admonition or fear Allaah, for he had transgressed all bounds in oppression and corruption. And He sent with Moosa his brother Haaroon. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“ ‘Go, both of you, to Fir‘awn (Pharaoh), verily, he has transgressed (all bounds in disbelief and disobedience and behaved as an arrogant and as a tyrant).
And speak to him mildly, perhaps he may accept admonition or fear (Allaah).’
They said: ‘Our Lord! Verily, we fear lest he should hasten to punish us or lest he should transgress (all bounds against us).’
He (Allaah) said: ‘Fear not, verily, I am with you both, hearing and seeing.
So go you both to him, and say: “Verily, we are Messengers of your Lord, so let the Children of Israel go with us, and torment them not; indeed, we have come with a sign from your Lord! And peace will be upon him who follows the guidance!”’”[Ta-Ha 20:43-47] 
·Moosa and Haaroon (peace be upon them) went to Pharaoh and conveyed the message to him. Pharaoh asked Moosa: 
“Fir‘awn (Pharaoh) said: ‘And what is the Lord of the ‘Aalameen (mankind, jinn and all that exists)?’
Moosa (Moses) said: ‘The Lord of the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them, if you seek to be convinced with certainty’”[al-Shu’araa’ 26:23-24] 
·Then Pharaoh asked Moosa for a sign to prove that he was speaking the truth: 
“[Fir‘awn (Pharaoh)] said: ‘If you have come with a sign, show it forth, if you are one of those who tell the truth.’
Then [Moosa (Moses)] threw his stick and behold! it was a serpent, manifest!
And he drew out his hand, and behold! it was white (with radiance) for the beholders”[al-A’raaf 7:106-108] 
·When Pharaoh and his people saw that, they accused Moosa of sorcery. They brought the sorcerers together and offered them a great reward. Then they gathered the people together on a feast day. The sorcerers threw down their sticks and ropes, 
“…So when they threw, they bewitched the eyes of the people, and struck terror into them, and they displayed a great magic”[al-A’raaf 7:116] 
·Then Allaah supported Moosa against the sorcerers and exposed the falsehood of their plots. Then the sorcerers believed in the Lord of the Worlds: 
“And We revealed to Moosa (Moses) (saying): ‘Throw your stick,’ and behold! It swallowed up straight away all the falsehood which they showed.
Thus truth was confirmed, and all that they did was made of no effect.
So they were defeated there and returned disgraced.
And the sorcerers fell down prostrate.
They said: ‘We believe in the Lord of the ‘Aalameen (mankind, jinn and all that exists).
The Lord of Moosa (Moses) and Haaroon (Aaron)’”[al-A’raaf 7:117-122] 
·When the sorcerers believed in Allaah, Pharaoh cut off their hands and feet on opposite sides and crucified them. But they bore that with patience and paid no heed to his threats, until they met Allaah as Muslims. Then the chiefs indicated that Moosa and his people should be killed, lest they spread corruption in the land. So they killed their sons, and let their women live. Moosa urged the Children of Israel to have patience. Then Pharaoh could no longer bear to see Moosa , so he decided to kill him: 
“Fir’awn (Pharaoh) said: ‘Leave me to kill Moosa (Moses), and let him call his Lord (to stop me from killing him)! I fear that he may change your religion, or that he may cause mischief to appear in the land!’”[Ghaafir 40:26] 
·Whilst they were thinking of killing Moosa, chivalry caused a believing man from among the family of Pharaoh, who was concealing his faith, to defend Moosa. He said, “If he is lying, he cannot harm us, and if he is telling the truth, then some of that of which he is warning you will befall you.” This man continued to advise Pharaoh and his people, but they did not respond to him: 
“… Fir‘awn (Pharaoh) said: ‘I show you only that which I see (correct), and I guide you only to the path of right policy!’”[Ghaafir 40:29] 
·Moosa continued to call Pharaoh and his people, preaching in a good manner, but it only made them more arrogant in the land and caused them to oppress and persecute the believers even more. So Moosa prayed against them, and Allaah punished them with drought, famine, and failure of the harvest, that they might receive admonition. But they did not submit, rather they persisted in their evil deeds and transgression. So Allaah punished them with other kinds of afflictions, so that they might return to their senses: 
“They said [to Moosa (Moses)]: ‘Whatever Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) you may bring to us, to work therewith your sorcery on us, we shall never believe in you.’
So We sent on them: the flood, the locusts, the lice, the frogs, and the blood (as a succession of) manifest signs, yet they remained arrogant, and they were of those people who were Mujrimoon (criminals, polytheists and sinners)’”[al-A’raaf 7:132-133] 
·When the transgression of Pharaoh intensified, there came the divine command to seek a way out. Allaah commanded Moosa to leave Egypt with the Children of Israel, in secret. When Pharaoh found out, he gathered a great army to catch up with Moosa and his people before they reached Palestine. Pharaoh and his troops set out, leaving behind them gardens and wealth. They caught up with Moosa and his people at sunrise, on the shores of the Red Sea. Allaah saved Moosa and his people, and drowned Pharaoh and his troops, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And We revealed to Moosa (Moses), saying: ‘Depart by night with My slaves, verily, you will be pursued.’
Then Fir‘awn (Pharaoh) sent callers to (all) the cities.
(Saying): ‘Verily, these indeed are but a small band.
And verily, they have done what has enraged us.
But we are a host all assembled, amply forewarned.’
So, We expelled them from gardens and springs,
Treasures, and every kind of honourable place.
Thus [We turned them (Pharaoh’s people) out] and We caused the Children of Israel to inherit them.
So they pursued them at sunrise.
And when the two hosts saw each other, the companions of Moosa (Moses) said: ‘We are sure to be overtaken.’
[Moosa (Moses)] said: ‘Nay, verily, with me is my Lord. He will guide me.’
Then We revealed to Moosa (Moses) (saying): ‘Strike the sea with your stick.’ And it parted, and each separate part (of that sea water) became like a huge mountain.
Then We brought near the others [Fir‘awn’s (Pharaoh’s) party] to that place.
And We saved Moosa (Moses) and all those with him.
Then We drowned the others.
Verily, in this is indeed a sign (or a proof), yet most of them are not believers.
And verily, your Lord, He is truly, the All‑Mighty, the Most Merciful”[al-Shu’araa’ 26:52-68] 
·Thus Pharaoh and his troops were destroyed. When he was drowning, he believed, but that was of no benefit to him. Allaah preserved his body to be a lesson to those who came after him. The punishment of Pharaoh’s family in this world was drowning in the sea, and in the Hereafter, theirs is a painful torment: 
“…while an evil torment encompassed Fir‘awn’s (Pharaoh) people.
The Fire, they are exposed to it, morning and afternoon. And on the Day when the Hour will be established (it will be said to the angels): ‘Cause Fir‘awn’s (Pharaoh) people to enter the severest torment!’”[Ghaafir 40:45-46] 
·The Children of Israel witnessed the miracles of Moosa, the last of which was their being saved and the destruction of their enemy. These miracles were sufficient to eradicate the last traces of idolatry from their hearts, but they still returned to it sometimes, and Moosa was faced with great difficulties in bringing them back to the worship of Allaah alone. For example: 
When they had crossed the sea, they passed by some people who worshipped idols. They asked Moosa to give them an idol which they could worship like those people did. Moosa said to them: 
“ ‘Verily, you are a people who know not (the Majesty and Greatness of Allaah and what is obligatory upon you, i.e. to worship none but Allaah Alone, the One and the Only God of all that exists).’
[Moosa (Moses) added:] ‘Verily, these people will be destroyed for that which they are engaged in (idols, worship). And all that they are doing is in vain.’
He said: ‘Shall I seek for you an ilaah (a god) other than Allaah, while He has given you superiority over the ‘Aalameen (mankind and jinn of your time)?’”[al-A’raaf 7:138-140] 
The Children of Israel were headed towards the Holy Land, and on the way they suffered from thirst. They complained to Moosa, who prayed to his Lord and He gave them water: 
“We revealed to Moosa (Moses) when his people asked him for water (saying): ‘Strike the stone with your stick’, and there gushed forth out of it twelve springs, each group knew its own place for water”[al-A’raaf 7:160] 
On their journey, they complained about the intense heat of the sun, and the lack of food. So Moosa prayed to his Lord and He shaded them with clouds, and provided them with good things (to eat), but they did not appreciate that, and they demanded something else. 
“We shaded them with the clouds and sent down upon them Al‑Manna and the quail (saying): ‘Eat of the good things with which We have provided you.’ They harmed Us not but they used to harm themselves”[al-A’raaf 7:160] 
Then they complained and said: 
“ ‘We cannot endure one kind of food. So invoke your Lord for us to bring forth for us of what the earth grows, its herbs, its cucumbers, its Foom (wheat or garlic), its lentils and its onions””
[al-Baqarah 2:61] 
Allaah had promised Moosa that He would send down to him a Book containing commands and prohibitions for the Children of Israel. When Pharaoh was destroyed, Moosa asked Allaah his Lord for that Book. Allaah commanded him to fast for forty days. He appointed his brother Haaroon as his deputy to be in charge of his people, and he fasted for those days. Then Allaah revealed the Tawraat (Torah) to him at the mountain of al-Toor (Sinai), in which there were lessons and explanations of all things. When he came back to his people, he found them worshipping the calf, which al-Saamiri had made for them from their jewellery and had told them, “This is your god and the god of Moosa.” 
“Then he took out (of the fire) for them (a statue of) a calf which seemed to low. They said: ‘This is your ilaah (god), and the ilaah (god) of Moosa (Moses), but he [Moosa (Moses)] has forgotten (his god).’
Did they not see that it could not return them a word (for answer), and that it had no power either to harm them or to do them good?
And Haaroon (Aaron) indeed had said to them beforehand: ‘O my people! You are being tried in this, and verily, your Lord is (Allaah) the Most Gracious, so follow me and obey my order.’
They said: ‘We will not stop worshipping it (i.e. the calf), until Moosa (Moses) returns to us’”[Ta-Ha 20:88-91] 
When Moosa came, he got angry with them and rebuked them, and explained the truth to them. Then he burned the calf, and threw it into the sea. He punished al-Saamiri and he subsequently felt pain from anything he touched. 
The Children of Israel regretted having worshipped the calf. Moosa chose from among them seventy men and took them to the Mountain (al-Toor/Sinai) to worship Allaah and show their regret for what they had done. There Allaah spoke to Moosa, but some of them did not believe that Allaah was the One who had spoken to Moosa. So they disobeyed him and said, Show us Allaah plainly.  
“And (remember) when you said: ‘O Moosa (Moses)! We shall never believe in you until we see Allaah plainly.’ But you were seized with a thunderbolt (lightning) while you were looking.
Then We raised you up after your death, so that you might be grateful”[al-Baqarah 2:55-56] 
When Moosa came back to the Children of Israel with the Tawraat, they refused to accept it and complained about its rulings. So he threatened them, then they accepted it, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And (O Children of Israel, remember) when We took your covenant and We raised above you the Mount (saying): ‘Hold fast to that which We have given you, and remember that which is therein so that you may become Al-Muttaqoon (the pious).
Then after that you turned away. Had it not been for the Grace and Mercy of Allaah upon you, indeed you would have been among the losers”[al-Baqarah 2:63-64] 
Then Moosa commanded the Children of Israel to go with him to the Holy Land in Palestine, so they went with him, then they became afraid of its powerful inhabitants, so they disobeyed Moosa and rebelled against him: 
“They said: ‘O Moosa (Moses)! We shall never enter it as long as they are there. So go you and your Lord and fight you two, we are sitting right here’”[al-Maa'idah 5:24] 
So Moosa prayed against them, and Allaah answered his prayer. He told him that the Holy Land was forbidden to them, and they would wander in the land for forty years, so he should not grieve over them: 
“He [Moosa (Moses)] said: ‘O my Lord! I have power only over myself and my brother, so separate us from the people who are the Faasiqoon (rebellious and disobedient to Allaah)!’
(Allaah) said: ‘Therefore it (this holy land) is forbidden to them for forty years; in distraction they will wander through the land. So be not sorrowful over the people who are the Faasiqoon (rebellious and disobedient to Allaah)’[al-Maa'idah 5:25-26] 
·Moosa bore with patience the many complaints of the Children of Israel. During that period of wandering, Haaroon died, then Moosa died, and most of them also died. When that time came to an end, Yoosha’ ibn Noon (Joshua the son of Nun) led them into the Holy Land and besieged it until he conquered it. He commanded them to enter the land prostrating, but they did not obey him, and entered it on their backsides. 
·Allaah bestowed great blessings upon the Children of Israel. He saved them from Pharaoh, and provided them with good things to eat. He made Prophets and kings from among them, and favoured them above all other people, but they were ungrateful for those blessings and did not appreciate them:
“And (remember) when Moosa (Moses) said to his people: ‘O my people! Remember the Favour of Allaah to you: when He made Prophets among you, made you kings and gave you what He had not given to any other among the ‘Aalameen (mankind and jinn, in the past)’”[al-Maa’idah 5:20] 
·The Jews say and do evil things which bring upon them the wrath and anger of Allaah. 
·They accused Allaah of being stingy: 
“The Jews say: ‘Allaah’s Hand is tied up (i.e. He does not give and spend of His Bounty).’ Be their hands tied up and be they accursed for what they uttered. Nay, both His Hands are widely outstretched. He spends (of His Bounty) as He wills”
[al-Maa'idah 5:64] 
·By virtue of this serious lie, they became disbelievers: 
“Indeed, Allaah has heard the statement of those (Jews) who say: ‘Truly, Allaah is poor and we are rich!’”[Aal ‘Imraan 3:181] 
·They attributed a son to Allaah; Allaah’s curse be upon them, how they are deluded away from the truth! 
“And the Jews say: ‘Uzayr (Ezra) is the son of Allaah…”[al-Tawbah 9:30] 
·When the Tawraat reached them, most of them disbelieved in its rulings. They turned away from the path of Allaah, and regarded wrongdoing as permissible, so Allaah punished them for their sins. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“For the wrongdoing of the Jews, We made unlawful for them certain good foods which had been lawful for them — and for their hindering many from Allaah’s Way;
And their taking of Riba  (usury) though they were forbidden from taking it and their devouring of men’s substance wrongfully (bribery). And We have prepared for the disbelievers among them a painful torment”[al-Nisaa’ 4:61] 
·Among their lies is their claim that they are the sons and the beloved of Allaah: 
“And (both) the Jews and the Christians say: ‘We are the children of Allaah and His loved ones.’ Say: ‘Why then does He punish you for your sins?’ Nay, you are but human beings of those He has created”[al-Maa'idah 5:18] 
·And among their lies is the following: 
“And they say, ‘None shall enter Paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian.’ These are their own desires. Say (O Muhammad), ‘Produce your proof if you are truthful’”[al-Baqarah 2:111] 
·And among their fabrications is the following: 
“And they (Jews) say, ‘The Fire (i.e. Hell-fire on the Day of Resurrection) shall not touch us but for a few numbered days.’ Say (O Muhammad to them): ‘Have you taken a covenant from Allaah, so that Allaah will not break His Covenant? Or is it that you say of Allaah what you know not?’”[al-Baqarah 2:80] 
·An example of their plots and betrayal is the way in which they distorted their Book, the Tawraat: 
“Among those who are Jews, there are some who displace words from (their) right places…”[al-Nisaa’ 4:46] 
·Among their crimes are their disbelief in the signs of Allaah and their killing the Prophets unlawfully, so Allaah will punish them for their sins. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And they were covered with humiliation and misery, and they drew on themselves the Wrath of Allaah. That was because they used to disbelieve the Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations etc.) of Allaah and killed the Prophets wrongfully. That was because they disobeyed and used to transgress the bounds (in their disobedience to Allaah, i.e. commit crimes and sins)”[al-Baqarah 2:61] 
·Because the Jews have committed so many wrongful actions and evil deeds, fabricated so many lies and spread so much corruption on earth, Allaah has created hatred and enmity among them, and they will never have lasting power until the Day of Resurrection: 
“We have put enmity and hatred amongst them till the Day of Resurrection. Every time they kindled the fire of war, Allaah extinguished it; and they (ever) strive to make mischief on the earth. And Allaah does not like the Mufsidoon (mischief‑makers)”[al-Maa'idah 5:64] 
·The Jews are weak and divided, each of them with different desires: 
“They fight not against you even together, except in fortified townships, or from behind walls. Their enmity among themselves is very great. You would think they were united, but their hearts are divided. That is because they are a people who understand not”[al-Hashr 59:14] 
·The Jews are the most hostile of all people towards those who believe. Because of their transgression and corruption, the Jews hate death because they fear what comes after death. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say (O Muhammad): ‘O you Jews! If you pretend that you are friends of Allaah, to the exclusion of (all) other mankind, then long for death if you are truthful.’
But they will never long for it (death), because of what (deeds) their hands have sent before them! And Allaah knows well the Zaalimoon (polytheists, wrongdoers, disbelievers)’”[al-Jumu’ah 62:6-7] 
·The Jews persisted in their corruption, transgression and deviation. Allaah sent many Prophets and Messengers to the Children of Israel, to bring them back to the Straight Path, and some of them believed in them and some disbelieved… until Allaah sent ‘Eesa ibn Maryam (peace be upon him) to them.","From: Usool al-Deen al-Islami, by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem al-Tuwayjri"

Allâh is All-Sufficient for His creatures' needs, All-Knowing.)","The correct view is that what is meant by wajh is the Face of Allah. So wherever you turn there is the Face of Allah, because Allah encompasses all things. For more, please see the detailed answer.","Allah is above His throne 


Commentary on “So wherever you turn (yourselves or your faces), there is the Face of Allah”


Commentary on “Everything will perish save His Face”","Praise be to Allah.Allah is above His throne 
We are obliged to believe that Allah has risen above His throne in a manner that befits His majesty, not in a manner that resembles human movement, and to believe that Allah has a Face that is not like the faces of His creation. 
So we should not go astray when interpreting verses and we must not distort their meanings; we should follow the views of the righteous salaf concerning that. 
Commentary on “So wherever you turn (yourselves or your faces), there is the Face of Allah”
With regard to the tafsir (commentary) on this verse, Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said: 
“If you ask whether every mention of the wajh (face) with reference to Allah means the Face of Allah which is one of His attributes, the answer is that this is the basic principle. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And turn not away those who invoke their Lord, morning and afternoon seeking His Face” [al-An’am 6:52]  
“And who has (in mind) no favour from anyone to be paid back, Except to seek the Wajh of his Lord, the Most High. He surely, will be pleased (when he will enter Paradise)” [al-Layl 92:19-21] 
And there are other similar verses. 
The basic principle is that what is meant by wajh is the Face of Allah which is one of His attributes. But there is a verse concerning which the mufassirin differed, which is this verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And to Allah belong the east and the west, so wherever you turn (yourselves or your faces) there is the Face of Allah.” [al-Baqarah 2:115] 
Some of them said that what is meant by wajh here is direction, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“For every nation there is a direction to which they face (in their prayers).” [al-Baqarah 2:148] 
So what is meant by wajh here is direction, so “there is the wajh of Allah” means there is the direction of prayer which Allah accepts. 
They said: because when travelling, if a person offers nafl prayers he can pray in whatever direction he is facing. 
But the correct view is that what is meant by wajh here is the Face of Allah. So wherever you turn there is the Face of Allah, because Allah encompasses all things, and because it was proven from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that when the worshipper stands to pray, Allah is in front of (before) him. Hence it is forbidden for the worshipper to spit in front of him, because Allah is in front of him. So if you pray in a place where you do not know where the qiblah is, but you do your best to figure it out and pray, and the qiblah is in fact behind you, then Allah is in front of you even in this situation. 
This is the correct meaning which is in accordance with the apparent meaning of the verse, and the first meaning does not in fact contradict it. 
So the two meanings do not contradict one another. 
It should be noted that this mighty Face which is described in terms of majesty and honour cannot be fully encompassed by human descriptions and imagination. Rather everything that you can think of, Allah is above that and is greater. 
“but they will never encompass anything of His Knowledge” [Ta-Ha 20:110 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Commentary on “Everything will perish save His Face”
With regard to the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “Everything will perish save His Face” [al-Qasas 28:88] 
What this means is that everything will perish except His Essence of which His Face is one of the attributes. (Sharh al-‘Aqidah al-Wasitiyyah by Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 1/243-245) 
We should not compare the Creator to His creation and imagine Him in terms of His creation, for Allah is as He has said of Himself (interpretation of the meaning): 
“There is nothing like Him.” [al-Shura 42:11] 
So Allah has risen above His Throne, and He faces the worshipper when he prays, and there is no contradiction between them with regard to Allah. 
Some people were similarly confused about the issue of Allah descending during the last third of the night to the lowest heaven. They said that the night is not the same throughout the earth, so how can Allah descend during the night and day at the same time? 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said: 
“Later generations who knew that the earth is round and that the sun revolves around the earth said: how can He descend during the last third of the night, when the last third of the night moves from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and goes to Europe and areas nearby? We say: now you are comparing the attributes of Allah to the attributes of created beings. If you believe it you do not have to do anything beyond that, so do not ask how. 
Rather say: When it is the last third of the night in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, then Allah descends, and when it is the last third of the night in America, Allah descends then as well. 
So our attitude is that we believe what has reached us via Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and that Allah descends to the lowest heaven when there is one third of the night left, and says, “Who will call upon Me, that I may answer him? Who will ask of Me, that I may give him? Who will ask My forgiveness so that I may forgive him?” (Sharh al-Wasitiyyah, 2/437)

Allah has encompassed all things with His knowledge, and has written it in al-Lawh al-Mahfooz, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):

“Have you not seen that Allah knows whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on the earth? There is no Najwa (secret counsel) of three but He is their fourth (with His Knowledge, while He Himself is over the Throne, over the seventh heaven), — nor of five but He is their sixth (with His Knowledge), — nor of less than that or more but He is with them (with His Knowledge) wheresoever they may be.

          a woman to say Ameen out loud, if she is in the presence of her mahrams 
          and there are no “strangers” (non-mahram men) present, because a woman 
          is forbidden to raise her voice in the presence of non-mahram men for 
          fear of fitnah (temptation). But in the presence of her mahrams she 
          is not forbidden to do so. 
 Shaykh 
          al-Fawzaan (may Allaah preserve him) was asked about a woman speaking 
          aloud during prayer, and he said: 
 
          It is mustahabb for her to recite out loud in prayer, 
          whether it is fard (obligatory) of naafil (supererogatory) (i.e., the

          at night she should recite out loud, but if that will disturb others 
          then she should not recite out loud. But in the case of the prayers 
          that are offered during the day, she should recite silently, because 
          the prayers during the day are to be recited silently. So it is not

 And because the situation of the poor means that help should be given to them as soon as possible; delaying payment causes harm to them. And hastening to pay it is furthest removed from miserliness and is more likely to be on the safe side. This is what pleases the Lord. It should not be delayed except in cases of necessity, such as delaying it in order to give it to the one who is in more need, or because you do not have cash in hand. It is also permissible to bring it forward and pay zakah before the time when it is due, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) made ‘Abbaas pay the zakah of two years in advance. (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, al-Zakah, 615; classed as hasan by al-Albani in Saheeh Sunan al-Tirmidhi). It may be paid in advance when all the conditions of zakah being obligatory are met.

Is this correct? How should we understand this word?",,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          Shaykh Muhammad al-Ameen al-Shanqeeti (may Allaah have 
          mercy on him) said: 
 
          The word ummah is used in four senses in the Qur’aan: 
 
          1 – The word ummah is used to mean a period of 
          time, as in the aayahs (interpretation of the meanings): 
 
          “And if We delay the torment for them till a determined 
          term [ila ummatin ma’doodah]”[Hood 11:8] 
 
          “Then the man who was released (one of the two who 
          were in prison), now at length [ba’da ummatin] remembered”[Yoosuf 12:45]
 
          2 – It is used to mean a group of people, which is the 
          usual usage, as in the aayahs (interpretation of the meaning): 
 
          “he found there a group of men [ummatan min al-naas] 
          watering (their flocks)”[al-Qasas 28:23] 
 
          “And for every Ummah (community or nation) there is 
          a Messenger”[Yoonus 10:47] 
 
          “Mankind were one community [ummah]”[al-Baqarah 2:213]
 
          and there are other similar aayahs. 
 
          3 – The word ummah is used to refer to a man who 
          is taken as a leader, as in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): 
 
          “Verily, Ibraaheem (Abraham) was an Ummah (a leader 
          having all the good righteous qualities)”[al-Nahl 16:120]
 
          4 – The word ummah is used to mean a way or religion,

But one friend told me he thinks that we are supposed to clean are butts after taking a crap with water and not ""JUST"" kleenex. I wash my hands after taking a crap but I only use kleenex to clean the behind. Is there an Islam rule that says we must use water for the butt wiping part? I hope not because its so hard and annoying, everytime i try to use water it spills all over the place.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: it is obligatory for the believer to obey the command of Allah and the command of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), even if that goes against his desires and choices. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“It is not for a believer, man or woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decreed a matter that they should have any option in their decision. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, he has indeed strayed into a plain error”
[al-Ahzaab 33:36] 
“The only saying of the faithful believers, when they are called to Allah (His Words, the Qur’aan) and His Messenger, to judge between them, is that they say: ‘We hear and we obey.’ And such are the successful (who will live forever in Paradise).
 And whosoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, fears Allah, and keeps his duty (to Him), such are the successful”
[al-Noor 24:51-52]
If the believer heeds the command of Allah and the command of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), then he will be rewarded for any difficulty that he encounters because of that. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to ‘Aa’ishah: “Your reward will be commensurate with your spending and your effort.” (al-Bukhaari, 1787; Muslim, 1211). 
With regard to the ruling on this issue: 
It is not obligatory to use water in order to remove any impurity that is left after relieving oneself, rather it is sufficient to use pebbles or tissue or any other things that may remove impurity. The evidence for that is the report narrated by Ahmad (23627) from ‘Aa’ishah, that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When any one of you goes and defecates, let him take with him three stones and cleanse himself with them, and that will be sufficient for him.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Irwa’ (44).  Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated that there was consensus among the Sahaabah that it is permissible to use only stones and that it is not obligatory to use water. Al-Mughni, 1/208. 
Although it is permissible to use just stones or tissue, it is preferable to use water. The evidence for that is the report narrated by al-Bukhaari ((150) and Muslim (271) from Anas ibn Maalik, who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to enter the washroom and I and another young boy like me would bring a leather vessel of water, and he would clean himself (istinja’) with water.” 
Al-Tirmidhi (19) narrated that ‘Aa’ishah said to the women: “Tell your husbands to clean themselves with water, for I am to shy to tell them. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to do that.” Classed as saheeh by al-Nawawi in al-Majmoo, 2/101. Al-Tirmidhi (may Allah have mercy on him) said following this hadeeth: “This is what should be done according to the scholars who preferred that istinja’ (cleaning oneself after relieving oneself) should be done with water, but if it is done with stones that is good enough in their view. But they regarded it as mustahabb to clean oneself with water and regarded that as preferable.” 
So if you use both tissues and water, that is the best; start with tissue then use water.

What matters do you think we should start with?",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is prescribed to start with ‘aqeedah (belief, tenets of faith), as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and all the Messengers did, and because of the hadeeth of Mu’aah, [in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to him, when he sent him to Yemen]:
""You will come to some of the people of the Book. When you reach them, invite them to testify that there is no god except Allaah and that Muhammad is His Messenger. If they obey you in that, then tell them that Allah has enjoined on them five prayers every day and night. If they obey you in that, then tell them that Allah has enjoined on them Sadaqah (i.e. Zakaah) to be taken from the rich among them and given to the poor among them. If they obey you in that, then exercise caution and do not take their best properties (as Zakaah). Fear the invocation (du’aa’) of the oppressed person, for there is no barrier between his invocation and Allaah.”
This is if the people who are being called are kaafirs (non-Muslims).

10262,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10262,Dividing Tawhid into categories,I hear from some knowledgable brothers concerning Tawhid and its categories that Shaykh ul Islam Taqi`ud deen Ibn Taymiyyaah (Rahimahullaah) held 2 catergories of Tawhid (ie; Tawhid Ar-Ruboobiyyaah and Tawhid Al Asmaa Was Sifaat) How true are these statements? Did Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Ibraheem (rahimahullaah) hold 4 catergories? and finally does Shaykh Saleeh Al Fawzaan (may Allah preserve him) hold 4 catergories of Tawhid?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
We must understand the principle which says that there is nothing wrong with using new terminology. This principle is well-known among the fuqaha’ and scholars of usool. Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
There is nothing wrong with new concepts and new words, unless there is something bad about them. 
Madaarij al-Saalikeen, 3/306 
Secondly: 
From early times the scholars have categorized the rulings of sharee’ah. This has only been done to make it easier to understand the texts and rulings of sharee’ah, especially as time goes by and knowledge of Arabic language becomes weaker and the language gets mixed with foreign languages. 
The scholars thought it wise to set out principles, issues and categories to make it easier to understand. There is nothing wrong with this, in fact it is a good thing because it makes knowledge more accessible to the Muslims. Al-Shaafa’i set out the principles of fiqh and his categorization was well-received and was followed by the scholars of usool who wrote commentaries on what he said and added to it. This was done in all branches of Islamic knowledge such as tajweed (recitation of Quran), Quran and others, including Tawhid. 
Thirdly: 
With regard to what the questioner mentions, that Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah] divided Tawhid into two categories and Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem divided it into four, as did Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan, there is nothing wrong with that. We will explain this to you. 
Some of the scholars said that Tawhid can be divided into two categories: 
Tawhid al-Ma’rifah wa’l-Ithbaat (Oneness of knowledge and affirmation): which includes believing in the existence of Allah and in His Lordship and His names and attributes. 
Tawhid al-Qasd wa’l-Talab (Oneness of object and aim), which includes believing in the divine nature of Allah. 
With regard to those who divided Tawhid into three categories, they explained the previous categorization in more detail and made it easier to understand. So they said that Tawhid is divided into three categories: 
Tawhid al-Ruboobiyyah (Oneness of divine Lordship): which includes belief in the existence of Allah. 
Tawhid al-Uloohiyyah (Oneness of the Divine nature) or Tawhid al-‘Ibaadah (Oneness of worship) – which mean the same thing. 
Tawhid al-Asma’ wa’l-Sifaat (Oneness of the Divine names and attributes) 
Then some of the scholars added to this categorization and said that Tawhid may be divided into four categories: 
Belief in the existence of Allah. 
Belief in the Lordship of Allah. 
Belief in the Divinity of Allah. 
Belief in the names and attributes of Allah. 
As we see, there is nothing wrong with this categorization as long as it does not point to anything false, and there is nothing wrong with the terminology. This categorization is only to make it easier to understand. The more time passes, the less people understand, and the scholars need to make things easier and simpler.  
To sum up, there is nothing wrong with what the questioner mentioned, because dividing Tawhid into two categories includes everything that is explained in detail by the others. Those who divided it into three or four categories explained in detail that which was mentioned in concise fashion by those who divided it into two. 
But all are agreed that Tawhid includes all the things that they mentioned.
There is nothing wrong with this categorization and this use of terminology, on condition that it does not lead to any problems, such as leaving out some of the concepts that are part of Tawhid, or introducing ideas that have nothing to do with it. 
There may come a time when it needs to be explained further, so the scholars will explain it with more categories in order to make it easier to understand. 
This is a brief explanation of what is meant by the three categories of Tawhid: 
Belief in Divine Lordship (ruboobiyyah): This means believing that Allah is the only One Who creates, gives life and death, etc. 
Belief in the Divine nature (uloohiyyah): This means believing that Allah is the only One Who to whom the people should devote their words and actions, both inward and outward. So none is to be worshipped but Him, may He be glorified and exalted. 
Belief in the names and attributes of Allah (al-asma’ wa’l-sifaat): which means affirming what Allah has affirmed for Himself of names and attributes, and denying any attributes that Allah has said are not His, without denying any of His attributes or likening any of His attributes to the attributes of any of His creation. 
Fourthly: 
The scholars’ dividing Tawhid into these categories is nothing new, rather it was known in the third and fourth centuries AH, as was mentioned by Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd, a member of the Council of Senior Scholars, in his book al-Radd ‘ala al-Mukhaalif.  This categorization was also narrated from Ibn Jareer al-Tabari and other scholars. 
Note: what the questioner mentioned, that Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah divided Tawhid into two categories – Tawhid al-Ruboobiyyah (Oneness of divine Lordship) and Tawhid al-Asmaa’ wa’l-Sifaat (Oneness of the divine names and attributes) – is not correct. Rather he divided it into two categories which were Tawhid al-Ma’rifah wa’l-Ithbaat (Oneness of knowledge and affirmation) and Tawhid al-Qasd wa’l-Talab (Oneness of object and aim), the first of which includes Tawhid al-Ruboobiyyah and Tawhid al-Asma’ wa’l-Sifaat.

And Allah knows best.",Islam Q&A
10263,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10263,How do we know when 'Ashura is this year?,"How should we fast ‘Aa’shooraa’ this year? Until now, we do not know when the month begins or whether Dhu’l-Hijjah has twenty-nine or thirty days. How can we define when 'Ashura is and fast it?",,,"Praise be to Allah.If we do not know whether the month of Dhu’l-Hijjah is complete (30 days) or imcomplete (29 days), and no one tells us when the new moon of Muharram was sighted, then we should follow the basic principle, which is that the month should be completed as thirty days. So Dhu’l-Hijjah is counted as being 30 days long, then we calculate the date of Ashura on that basis. 
If a Muslim wants to be sure that he has fasted on the right day, he should fast two consecutive days at Ashura. So he should calculate when Ashura will be if Dhu’l-Hijjah is twenty-nine days and if it is thirty days, and fast these two days. Thus he will be definite that he has fasted Ashura, and in this case he will have fasted either the ninth and tenth, or the tenth and eleventh, both of which are good. If he wants to be sure of fasting Taasoo’ah (the ninth of Muharram) as well, then he should fast the two days we have spoken of above and the day immediately before them as well. Then he will have fasted the ninth, tenth and eleventh, or the eighth, ninth and tenth. In either case he will have fasted the ninth and tenth for sure. 
If someone were to say “My work and other circumstances only allow me to fast one day, so which is the best day for me to fast?” we say to him: 
Count Dhu’l-Hijjah as being thirty days and work out the tenth day (of Muharram), then fast on that day. 
This is a summary of what I heard our shaykh, ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him), say when I asked him about this matter. 
If we receive news from a trustworthy Muslim that he has seen the new moon of Muharram, we should act in accordance with that. Fasting at any time in Muharram is Sunnah, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The best fasting after the month of Ramadan is fasting in the month of Muharram.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1163)

1-But if what you mean is what the Muslim ummah (nation) has achieved down throughout the ages of prosperity, then this was not achieved in one instant, but it started when Islam started, especially after the establishment of the Islamic state at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), then it started to flourish and develop as the Islamic conquests spread and reached the level that they did. If this can be attributed to anyone, it can only be attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), after Allah. With regard to other people, everyone contributed as much as he could until the structure (of the Muslim civilization) was complete.
2-With regard to the beginning of the religion, it seems that what is meant by religion is the religion of Islam with its beliefs and laws. This started with the mission of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
With regard to the rules of Islam, they are many and it is difficult to list them all here, but the most important of them are: 
The testimony that there is no god except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; establishing regular prayer; paying the zakaah (obligatory charity, a share of one’s wealth to be given to the poor); fasting in Ramadaan; and Hajj or pilgrimage to the Sacred House of Allah. 
An individual enters this religion after bearing witness that there is no god except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, then after that he is obliged to adhere to the other pillars, prayer, fasting and Hajj. There are many further details involved in these matters.

10268,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10268,Praying in musallas,"Here in the university residence we have several buildings, in which there are musallas (prayer rooms). On each floor there is more than one musalla. Some of the students gather in these musallas and pray in congregation there, even though there is a mosque nearby and they are able to pray there. 

Is it permissible to hold the prayers in these musallas, even though there is a mosque nearby?",,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          It is obligatory to pray in congregation in the mosque, 
          as the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded. He thought of 
          burning down the houses of people who did not attend the prayers with 
          him because of their non-attendance. He did not excuse them when they 
          prayed in congregation in their houses, even though there were men and 
          women there with whom they could pray in congregation. Ibn Mas’ood (may 
          Allaah be pleased with him) said: “Pray them [the prayers] where the 
          call to them is given.” Neither did he 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) give a concession to the 
          blind man to pray in congregation in his house, rather he commanded 
          him to come to the mosque so long as he could hear the call. 
 
          So prayer in congregation is obligatory and is enjoined 
          (in Islam). If it were sufficient to pray in congregation in any other 
          place, the blind man and others would have been allowed to pray in congregation 
          in their homes with their children and womenfolk. But he 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not allow that. 
 
          So these students must go to the houses of Allaah, which 
          has a particular virtue and reward  when one goes there and comes 
          back.  There is virtue in entering and leaving the mosques and 
          in the dhikr recited at those times. They should not be lazy and neglect 
          gathering in the mosque. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
 
          “In houses (mosques) which Allaah has ordered to be 
          raised (to be cleaned, and to be honoured), in them His Name is remembered 
          [i.e. Adhaan, Iqaamah, Salaah (prayers), invocations, recitation of 
          the Qur’aan]. Therein glorify Him (Allaah) in the mornings and in the 
          afternoons or the evenings”[al-Noor 24:36]
 
          Moreover, praying in musallas splits the congregations of Muslims, which 
          goes against the aim of sharee’ah, which is for the people of one quarter 
          to gather in one mosque; for the people of many quarters to gather in 
          one Jaami’ (Friday mosque) once a week; for the people of a city to 
          gather in one prayer-place for Eid prayers; and for a huge number of 
          Muslims from all over the world to gather on Hajj. Gathering together 
          brings many benefits, as is well known. 
 
          Among the differences between a musalla and a mosque 
          is that the mosque is a waqf (endowment) that lasts until the Hour begins, 
          whereas the location of a musalla may be changed, it may be bought or 
          sold or inherited, and so on. This is unlike a mosque which must remain 
          a mosque so long as the world remains, and which has special virtues 
          which are greater than those of a musalla. So it is prescribed to “greet” 
          the mosque (by praying two rak’ahs), unlike other places. 
 
          If there is a mosque nearby, it is obligatory to go there 
          to pray, but if the mosque is far away and the adhaan cannot be heard 
          from afar, then in this case it is permissible to pray in the musallas. 
 
          Those who call people to Allaah should be wise and should 
          encourage the students to pray in the mosques without putting them off 
          from praying in congregation altogether. For some ignorant people may 
          give up praying altogether when they see the harshness of some of the 
          daa’iyahs. So we must pay attention to this and call people in a good 
          manner.

10276,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10276,A new Muslimah wants to study but cannot,"There is a muslim sister who just finished high school last year. and she moved overseas away from her mother to her brother in another country. however she became muslim and the rest of her family is not muslim or followers of any belief. 

she used to wear hidjab but now she does not wear it properly. there is no excuse for it but she wishes she could get a job that has no problem with her hidjab. and that her brother would not push her to take it off. she has a job, but wants to go to college and get a degree in teaching. That is a problem. 
Because in her mother's country, the government loans involve high interest. 
and the country she is in now, has loans without interest, but she must wait two whole years before she can even apply for such a loan. she does not want to waste her time. she met a pious taxi driver who told her she should not be in such an environment; she should marry as soon as possible. her brother would never let her leave the house and he has a very strong influence. she feels like going back to her mother's country to study but she does not desire a loan with riba. what do you advise her to do.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
Who has guided you to Islam. This is a great blessing that 
    cannot be matched by any other blessing on earth. 
    Secondly: 
Undoubtedly the committed Muslim who is new in Islam will face some difficulties 
    and problems, especially when they come from a way of life which has to be changed when one enters Islam. As a result, the new Muslim may face 
    some difficulties with his family and the society in which he lives. 
Thirdly: 
The new Muslim must look for committed and righteous friends who can help him, 
    teach him and give him advice so that he will not be affected by the atmosphere around him, and so that the Shaytaan or bad friends cannot make 
    him slip or go back to his former ways.  
Fourthly: 
I advise this Muslim sister to fear Allaah and to wear proper Islamic hijab. She 
    may face some difficulties but Allaah will help her and will protect her if He knows that she has a sincere and pure intention. 
Fifthly: 
I advise her not to go to university because that will lead her to doing some 
    things that are forbidden in sharee’ah, such as dealing with riba (interest) – as mentioned in the question – or taking off her hijab or mixing 
    freely with men. 
Sixthly: 
I advise her to look for a Muslim husband who will keep her chaste and under whose 
    protection she can live, as that Muslim taxi driver mentioned to her. She should seek the help of Allaah to achieve that. And she should strive to 
    learn Islam so that she can call others to Allaah and save whoever she can among her family, relatives and society from dying in shirk. This is 
    the best and most important of deeds. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And who is better in speech than he who [says: ‘My Lord is Allaah (believes in 
    His Oneness),’ and then stands firm (acts upon His Order), and] invites (men) to Allaah’s (Islamic Monotheism), and does righteous deeds, and 
    says: ‘I am one of the Muslims’”

Followers’ of Jesus are closer to Muslims","Praise be to Allah.Who is Maryam (Mary)?
Maryam the daughter of ‘Imran was a pious and righteous woman… She strove hard in worship until she had no peer in matters of worship… The angels gave her the glad tidings that Allah had chosen her: 
“And (remember) when the angels said: ‘O Maryam (Mary)! Verily, Allah has chosen you, purified you (from polytheism and disbelief), and chosen you above the women of the ‘Alamin (mankind and jinn) (of her lifetime).’ O Maryam! ‘Submit yourself with obedience to your Lord (Allah, by worshipping none but Him Alone) and prostrate yourself, and bow down along with Ar-Raki‘un (those who bow down)’” [Aal 'Imran 3:42-43] 
The angels give Maryam the glad tidings of the creation of Jesus
Then the angels gave Maryam the glad tidings that Allah would bestow upon her a child, whom He would create with the word “Be! And it is.” This child’s name was the Messiah ‘Isa ibn Maryam (Jesus son of Mary )… He would be held in honour in this world and in the Hereafter, and he would be a messenger to the Children of Israel… He would teach the Book and wisdom, and the Tawrat (Torah) and Injil (Gospel) … And he would have attributes and miracles that no one else would have, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“(Remember) when the angels said: ‘O Maryam (Mary)! Verily, Allah gives you the glad tidings of a Word [“Be!” — and he was! i.e. ‘Isa (Jesus) the son of Maryam (Mary)] from Him, his name will be the Messiah ‘Isa (Jesus), the son of Maryam (Mary), held in honour in this world and in the Hereafter, and will be one of those who are near to Allah. He will speak to the people, in the cradle and in manhood, and he will be one of the righteous.’ She said: ‘O my Lord! How shall I have a son when no man has touched me.’ He said: ‘So (it will be) for Allah creates what He wills. When He has decreed something, He says to it only: “Be!” and it is’” [Al ‘Imran 3:45-47] 
The miracles of Jesus
Then Allah tells us the rest of the glad tidings of the angels to Maryam of her son ‘Isa (peace be upon him), and of the honour of ‘Isa, and how He would support him with miracles: 
“And He (Allah) will teach him [‘Isa (Jesus)] the Book and Al-Hikmah (i.e. the Sunnah, the faultless speech of the prophets, wisdom), (and) the Tawrat (Torah) and the Injil (Gospel).
And will make him [‘Isa (Jesus)] a messenger to the Children of Israel (saying): ‘I have come to you with a sign from your Lord, that I design for you out of clay, a figure like that of a bird, and breathe into it, and it becomes a bird by Allah’s Leave; and I heal him who was born blind, and the leper, and I bring the dead to life by Allah’s Leave. And I inform you of what you eat, and what you store in your houses. Surely, therein is a sign for you, if you believe.
And I have come confirming that which was before me of the Tawrat (Torah), and to make lawful to you part of what was forbidden to you, and I have come to you with a proof from your Lord. So fear Allah and obey me.
Truly, Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him (Alone). This is the Straight Path’” [Al ‘Imran 3:48-51] 
Miraculous birth of Jesus
Allah is absolutely perfect in His powers of creation. He creates what He wills, how He wills… He created Adam from dust without a father or a mother, and He created Hawwa from the rib of Adam from a father but without a mother. He has caused the descendants of Adam to have both a father and a mother, and He created ‘Isa from his mother without a father … Glory be to the All-Knowing Creator. 
Story of the creation of Jesus in the Quran
Allah has explained clearly in the Quran how ‘Isa was born. He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And mention in the Book (the Quran, O Muhammad, the story of) Maryam (Mary), when she withdrew in seclusion from her family to a place facing east.
She placed a screen (to screen herself) from them; then We sent to her Our Rooh [angel Jibril (Gabriel)], and he appeared before her in the form of a man in all respects.
She said: ‘Verily, I seek refuge with the Most Gracious (Allah) from you, if you do fear Allah.’
(The angel) said: ‘I am only a messenger from your Lord, (to announce) to you the gift of a righteous son.’
She said: ‘How can I have a son, when no man has touched me, nor am I unchaste?’
He said: ‘So (it will be), your Lord said: ‘That is easy for Me (Allah). And (We wish) to appoint him as a sign to mankind and a mercy from Us (Allah), and it is a matter (already) decreed (by Allah)’ ” [Maryam 19:16-21]   
When Jibril told her that, she submitted to the will and decree of Allah, and Jibril breathed into the sleeves of her garment: 
“So she conceived him, and she withdrew with him to a far place (i.e. Bethlehem valley about 4-6 miles from Jerusalem).
And the pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a date palm. She said: ‘Would that I had died before this, and had been forgotten and out of sight!’”[Maryam 19:22-23] 
Then Allah provided Maryam with water and food, and commanded her not to speak to anyone: 
“Then [the babe ‘Isa (Jesus) or Jibril (Gabriel)] cried unto her from below her, saying: ‘Grieve not: your Lord has provided a water stream under you.
And shake the trunk of the date palm towards you, it will let fall fresh ripe dates upon you.
So eat and drink and be glad. And if you see any human being, say: “Verily, I have vowed a fast unto the Most Gracious (Allah) so I shall not speak to any human being this day”’” [Maryam 19:24-26] 
Then Maryam came to her people, carrying her child ‘Isa. When they saw her, they thought that she had done a terrible thing and they denounced it, but she did not respond to them. She indicated that they should ask this infant, and he would tell them. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Then she brought him (the baby) to her people, carrying him. They said: ‘O Mary! Indeed you have brought a thing fariyy (a mighty thing).
O sister (i.e. the like) of Harun (Aaron)! Your father was not a man who used to commit adultery, nor your mother was an unchaste woman.’
Then she pointed to him. They said: How can we talk to one who is a child in the cradle?’” [Maryam 19:27-29] 
 ‘Isa replied to them straight away, even though he was a child in the cradle: 
“He [‘Isa (Jesus)] said: ‘Verily, I am a slave of Allah, He has given me the Scripture and made me a prophet;
And He has made me blessed wheresoever I be, and has enjoined on me Salah (prayer), and Zakah, as long as I live.
And dutiful to my mother, and made me not arrogant, unblest.
And Salam (peace) be upon me the day I was born, and the day I die, and the day I shall be raised alive!’” [Maryam 19:30-33] 
What do Christians believe about Jesus?
This is the information about ‘Isa ibn Maryam, the slave and messenger of Allah . But the People of the Book differed concerning him. Some of them said that he was the son of God , and some said that he was the third of three (“trinity”), and some said that he was God, and some said that he was a slave and messenger of God. This last view is the correct view. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Such is ‘Isa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary). (It is) a statement of truth, about which they doubt (or dispute).
It befits not (the Majesty of) Allah that He should beget a son [this refers to the slander of Christians against Allah, by saying that ‘Isa (Jesus) is the son of Allah]. Glorified (and Exalted) be He (above all that they associate with Him). When He decrees a thing, He only says to it: “Be!” and it is.
[‘Isa (Jesus) said]: ‘And verily, Allah is my Lord and your Lord. So worship Him (Alone). That is the Straight Path. (Allah's religion of Islamic Monotheism which He did ordain for all of His Prophets).’
Then the sects differed [i.e. the Christians about ‘Isa (Jesus)], so woe unto the disbelievers [those who gave false witness by saying that ‘Isa (Jesus) is the son of Allah] from the Meeting of a great Day (i.e. the Day of Resurrection, when they will be thrown in the blazing Fire)” [Maryam 19:34-38] 
Allah sent Jesus as a messenger
When the Children of Israel deviated from the Straight Path and overstepped the limits set by Allah, they did wrong and spread corruption on earth, and a group among them denied the Resurrection, Reckoning and punishment. They indulged in their desires and in physical pleasures without expecting to be brought to account. At that point, Allah sent to them ‘Isa ibn Maryam as a messenger, and taught him the Tawrat and Injil as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And He (Allah) will teach him [‘Isa (Jesus)] the Book and Al-Hikmah (i.e. the Sunnah, the faultless speech of the prophets, wisdom), (and) the Tawrat (Torah) and the Injil (Gospel).
And will make him [‘Isa (Jesus)] a Messenger to the Children of Israel” [Al ‘Imran 3:48] 
Allah reveals the Gospel to Jesus
Allah revealed to ‘Isa ibn Maryam the Injil (Gospel) as guidance and light, confirming that which had come before it in the Tawrat: 
“and We gave him the Injil (Gospel), in which was guidance and light and confirmation of the Tawrat (Torah) that had come before it, a guidance and an admonition for Al-Muttaqun (the pious)” [al-Maidah 5:46 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Jesus foretold the coming of Prophet Muhammad
‘Isa (peace be upon him) foretold the coming of a Messenger from Allah after him, whose name would be Ahmad. This is Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And (remember) when ‘Isa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), said: ‘O Children of Israel! I am the Messenger of Allah unto you, confirming the Tawrat [(Torah) which came] before me, and giving glad tidings of a Messenger to come after me, whose name shall be Ahmad.’ But when he (Ahmad, i.e. Muhammad) came to them with clear proofs, they said: ‘This is plain magic’” [al-Saff 61:6] 
What did Jesus teach?
‘Isa (peace be upon him) called the Children of Israel to worship Allah Alone , and to obey the rulings of the Tawrat and Injil… He started to dispute with them and to explain the error of their ways. When he saw how stubborn they were and how the signs of disbelief were manifest among them, he stood among his people, saying, Who will be my helpers in the cause of Allah? The disciples believed in him, and their number was twelve. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Then when ‘Isa (Jesus) came to know of their disbelief, he said: ‘Who will be my helpers in Allah’s cause?’ Al-Hawariyyun (the disciples) said: ‘We are the helpers of Allah; we believe in Allah, and bear witness that we are Muslims (i.e. we submit to Allah).’
Our Lord! We believe in what You have sent down, and we follow the Messenger [‘Isa (Jesus)]; so write us down among those who bear witness (to the truth, i.e. La ilaha illallah — none has the right to be worshipped but Allah)” [Al ‘Imran 3:52-53] 
More miracles of Jesus
Allah supported ‘Isa with great miracles which remind us of the power of Allah, lift the spirit and promote faith in Allah and in the Last Day. He made something like the shape of a bird from clay, and blew into it, and it became a bird, by Allah’s leave.He healed the blind and the leper, and brought the dead back to life by Allah’s leave. He told the people what they were eating and what they were storing in their houses. So the Jews to whom Allah had sent ‘Isa became hostile towards him and tried to guide the people away from him, so they disbelieved in him and accused his mother of immorality. 
Was Jesus crucified?
When they saw that the weak and poor believed in him, and were gathering around him, they formed a plot to kill him. So they provoked the Romans against him, and they made the Roman governor think that the call of ‘Isa contained a threat against (Roman) power. So he (the Roman governor) issued orders that ‘Isa should be arrested and crucified. But Allah caused a hypocrite who had betrayed him to the Romans to look like ‘Isa. The soldiers arrested him, thinking that he was ‘Isa, and crucified him. But Allah saved ‘Isa from the cross and from death, and Allah tells us about the Jews (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And because of their saying (in boast), ‘We killed the Messiah ‘Isa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), the messenger of Allah,’ — but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but it appeared so to them the resemblance of ‘Isa (Jesus) was put over another man (and they killed that man)], and those who differ therein are full of doubts. They have no (certain) knowledge, they follow nothing but conjecture. For surely; they killed him not [i.e. ‘Isa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary)]:
But Allah raised him [‘Isa (Jesus)] up (with his body and soul) unto Himself (and he is in the heavens). And Allah is Ever All Powerful, All Wise.” [al-Nisa 4:157-158]
Second coming of Jesus
So ‘Isa (peace be upon him) did not die, rather Allah raised him up to Himself, and he will descend before the Day of Resurrection and will follow Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
He will prove the Jews to be wrong in their claim to have killed ‘Isa and crucified him. And he will prove the Christians to be wrong who exaggerated about him and said that he was God, or the son of God, or the third of three.
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, the son of Maryam will descend among you as a just judge. He will break the cross, kill the pigs and abolish the jizyah (tax paid by non-Muslims in an Islamic state), and money will become so widespread that there will be no one who will accept it.” (Agreed upon; narrated by Muslim, no. 155). 
Will the People of the Book believe in Jesus when returns?
 When ‘Isa comes down before the Day of Resurrection , the People of the Book will believe in him, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And there is none of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) but must believe in him [‘Isa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), as only a messenger of Allah and a human being] before his [‘Isa (Jesus) or a Jew’s or a Christian’s] death (at the time of the appearance of the angel of death). And on the Day of Resurrection, he [‘Isa (Jesus)] will be a witness against them” [al-Nisa 4:159] 
Jesus in Islam
‘Isa ibn Maryam is the slave of Allah and His messenger. Allah sent him to guide the Children of Israel and to call them to worship Allah Alone, as Allah says to the Jews and Christians (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O people of the Scripture (Christians)! Do not exceed the limits in your religion, nor say of Allah aught but the truth. The Messiah ‘Isa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), was (no more than) a messenger of Allah and His Word, (‘Be!’ — and he was) which He bestowed on Maryam (Mary) and a spirit (Ruh) created by Him; so believe in Allah and His messengers. Say not: ‘Three (trinity)!’ Cease! (it is) better for you. For Allah is (the only) One AIlah (God), glory is to Him (far exalted is He) above having a son. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. And Allah is All Sufficient as a Disposer of affairs.” [al-Nisa 4:171]
Is Jesus the son of God?
Saying that ‘Isa is the son of God is a monstrous saying and a great evil.  
“And they say: ‘The Most Gracious (Allah) has begotten a son (or offspring or children) [as the Jews say: ‘Uzair (Ezra) is the son of Allah, and the Christians say that He has begotten a son [‘Isa (Jesus)], and the pagan Arabs say that He has begotten daughters (angels and others)].’
Indeed you have brought forth (said) a terrible evil thing.
Whereby the heavens are almost torn, and the earth is split asunder, and the mountains fall in ruins,
That they ascribe a son (or offspring or children) to the Most Gracious (Allah).
But it is not suitable for (the Majesty of) the Most Gracious (Allah) that He should beget a son (or offspring or children).
There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes unto the Most Gracious (Allah) as a slave.” [Maryam 19:88-93] 
Is Jesus God?
‘Isa ibn Maryam is a human being, a slave of Allah and His messenger. Whoever believes that the Messiah son of Maryam is God is a disbeliever (kafir). 
“Surely, they have disbelieved who say: Allah is the Messiah [‘Isa (Jesus)], son of Maryam (Mary)’” [al-Maidah 5:72]
Whoever says that the Messiah is the son of God or the third of three is also a disbeliever: 
“Surely, disbelievers are those who said: ‘Allah is the third of the three (in a Trinity).” But there is no Ilah (god) (none who has the right to be worshipped) but One AIlah (God —Allah). And if they cease not from what they say, verily, a painful torment will befall on the disbelievers among them” [al-Maidah 5:73] 
Human nature of Jesus
The Messiah son of Maryam was a human being. He was born from a mother; he ate and drank, got up and went to sleep, suffered pain and wept… and God (Allah) is far above all of that, so how could he be God? Rather he is the slave of Allah and His messenger: 
“The Messiah [‘Isa (Jesus)], son of Maryam (Mary), was no more than a messenger; many were the messengers that passed away before him. His mother [Maryam (Mary)] was a Siddiqah [i.e. she believed in the Words of Allah and His Books]. They both used to eat food (as any other human being, while Allah does not eat). Look how We make the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) clear to them; yet look how they are deluded away (from the truth)” [al-Maidah 5:75] 
Distorting the religion of Jesus
The Jews, Christians, crusaders and their followers distorted the religion of the Messiah, and deviated and changed it. They said that Allah sent forth his son the Messiah to be killed and crucified as a sacrifice for mankind – so it doesn’t matter if anyone does whatever he wants, because Jesus will carry all his sins for him… And they spread that belief among all the Christian groups until it became a part of their beliefs.
All of this is falsehood and is lies against Allah, and speaking about Him without knowledge. Rather “every soul will be (held) in pledge for its deeds”. Man’s life cannot be sound or correct unless they have a path to follow and limits at which to stop. 
How the Jews, Christians, crusaders and their followers fabricate lies against Allah 
Look at how they fabricate lies against Allah, and speak about Allah with no guidance: 
“Then woe to those who write the Book with their own hands and then say, ‘This is from Allah,’ to purchase with it a little price! Woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for that they earn thereby.” [al-Baqarah 2:79] 
·Allah has taken from the Christians the pledge that they will follow ‘Isa and follow that which he brought, but they changed and distorted that; they differed then they turned away. So Allah will punish them with enmity and hatred in this world, and with torment in the Hereafter, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And from those who call themselves Christians, We took their covenant, but they have abandoned a good part of the Message that was sent to them. So We planted amongst them enmity and hatred till the Day of Resurrection (when they discarded Allah's Book, disobeyed Allah’s messengers and His orders and transgressed beyond bounds in Allah’s disobedience); and Allah will inform them of what they used to do.” [al-Maidah 5:14] 
Did Jesus claim that he is God or the son of God?
On the Day of Resurrection, ‘Isa will stand before the Lord of the Worlds, Who will ask him before the witnesses what he said to the Children of Israel, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And (remember) when Allah will say (on the Day of Resurrection): ‘O ‘Isa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary)! Did you say unto men: “Worship me and my mother as two gods besides Allah?”’  He will say: ‘Glory be to You! It was not for me to say what I had no right (to say). Had I said such a thing, You would surely have known it. You know what is in my inner-self though I do not know what is in Yours; truly, You, only You, are the All-Knower of all that is hidden (and unseen).
Never did I say to them aught except what You (Allah) did command me to say: “Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.”’ And I was a witness over them while I dwelt amongst them, but when You took me up, You were the Watcher over them; and You are a Witness to all things. (This is a great admonition and warning to the Christians of the whole world).
If You punish them, they are Your slaves, and if You forgive them, verily, You, only You, are the All Mighty, the All Wise.”’ [al-Maidah 5:116-118] 
Followers’ of Jesus are closer to Muslims
Allah has created kindness and mercy among the followers of ‘Isa and the believers. They are closer in friendship to the followers of Muhammad than anyone else, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, you will find the strongest among men in enmity to the believers (Muslims) the Jews and those who are Al-Mushrikun (polytheists), and you will find the nearest in love to the believers (Muslims) those who say: ‘We are Christians.’ That is because amongst them are priests and monks, and they are not proud.” [al-Maidah 5:82] 
‘Isa ibn Maryam was the last of the prophets sent to the Children of Israel. Then after him Allah sent Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), from among the descendants of Isma’il, to all of mankind. And he is the last of the prophets and messengers.

2-Knowing that Allaah is always watching and bearing in mind that He is with you; He can see you and everything that you do is being recorded.

Some (scholars) differentiated between al-Waahidand al-Ahad by saying that al-Waahid refers to His being one in His essence only, whilst al-Ahad means that He is one in both His essence and His attributes. (Tafseer Asmaa’ Allaah by al-Zajjaaj, p. 58).
 And it was said that al-Waahid means He is unique in His essence and does not have any peer or rival, and al-Ahad is Unique in His attributes. So al-Waahid is one in and of Himself, and al-Ahad means being one in His attributes. Al-Ahad is one of the attributes of Allaah which belong uniquely to Him, and in which nothing else has a share. (Lisaan al-‘Arab –Ahad – 1/35; wahida 8/4779 – 4783). Allaah is al-Waahid al-Ahad, and has no second, no partner, no peer and no rival. He is al-Waahid upon Whom His slaves depend and Whom they seek. They do not put their trust in anyone except Him. (Ishtiqaaq Asmaa’ Allaah, 90-93). He is al-Waahid and there is none like unto Him. Everything other than Him that is called one in some aspect will not be one in many other aspects. (Sha’n al-Du’aa’, 82-83)
 Ibn Jareer believed that the Oneness of Allaah ruled out there being anything else that could be like Him. Allaah has no peer and no rival. He is the One God, the One Lord, and no one other than Him deserves to be obeyed; no one other than Him should beworshipped. (Tafseer Ibn Jareer, 3/265-266)
 And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And your Ilaah (God) is One Ilaah (God — Allaah)” [al-Baqarah 2:163]
 Allaah is One and is Perfect in all ways; He has no partner or associate. His slaves must affirm His Oneness in their hearts and in their words and deeds, by acknowledging His absolute perfection and directing all acts of worship solely to Him.

    whatever is best, whether that is eating it and estimating its value, or 
    selling it and keeping the money, or keeping it for the prescribed period of 
    time whilst trying to find its owner. Leaving it and not taking it exposes 
    it to destruction. Then if its owner comes along, the person can either 
    return it or pay him its value or the price he got for selling it. If the 
    owner does not show up, then it belongs to the one who found it.","Tayseer al-‘Allaam Sharh ‘Umdat al-Ahkaam, p. 775"

10289,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10289,Is this durood shirk?,"Is it shirk to recite this darood :
“ALLAHUMA SALL-E-WASALLIM  ‘ALAA SAYEDINA MOHAMMADIN QAD DAQAT HEELATI ADRIKNI YA RASOOL ALLAH """,,,"Praise be to Allah.Yes, this counts as shirk, because it is seeking the help of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and complaining about one’s situation to him. This implies that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) can hear the call of those who call upon him in any place, and that he helps those who seek his help, and that he can relieve their distress. The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was not able to do this when he was alive, so how about after his death? He does not know the unseen, and he does not possess the power to cause harm or bring benefits to himself or to others. Allah says (interpretation of the meanings):
“Say (O Muhammad): “I possess no power over benefit or hurt to myself except as Allah wills. If I had the knowledge of the Ghayb (Unseen), I should have secured for myself an abundance of wealth” (al-A’raaf 7:188)
“And your Lord said: “Invoke Me [i.e. believe in My Oneness (Islamic Monotheism) and ask Me for anything] I will respond to your (invocation)” (Ghaafir 40:60)
“And when My slaves ask you (O Muhammad) concerning Me, then (answer them), I am indeed near (to them by My Knowledge). I respond to the invocations of the supplicant when he calls on Me (without any mediator or intercessor)” (al-Baqarah 2:186)
 So people should not call on anyone except Allah; they should not seek the help of anyone except Him; they should not place their hopes in anyone except Him; they should not put their trust in anyone except Him. Allah alone is the One in Whose hand is sovereignty and goodness, and He is Able to do all things.
 Knowing the unseen, relieving distress, hearing the call of those who call upon Him and responding to them, are all things which only the Lord does. Whoever attributes any of these things to anyone else is a mushrik who is guilty of major shirk (shirk akbar). Allah says (interpretation of the meanings):
“Is not He (better than your gods) Who responds to the distressed one, when he calls on Him, and Who removes the evil, and makes you inheritors of the earth, generations after generations? Is there any ilaah (god) with Allah? Little is that you remember!” (al-Naml 27:62)
“Say: None in the heavens and the earth knows the Ghayb (Unseen) except Allah” (al-Naml 27:65)
 Allah is the One Who forgives sins, relieves distress and knows what is in people’s hearts. People should not seek these things – forgiveness of sins, relief from distress and other things which no one is able to do except Allah – from anyone other than Him, for He is the Only One Who is able to do that.",Islam Q&A - Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
10292,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10292,He hears the call to prayer but he does not respond,"What is the ruling on one who hears the adhaan and even the iqaamah and the prayer itself, but does not come to pray? What is the ruling on one who prays Jumu’ah (Friday prayer) only?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    If a person hears the call to prayer but does not respond, 
    his prayer (elsewhere and not in the mosque) does not count, unless he has a 
    valid excuse. What is meant is that his prayer is imperfect and he is a 
    sinner because he kept away from the prayer in congregation. Ibn Mas’ood 
    (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “No one keeps away from the prayer 
    (in congregation) except a hypocrite who is known for his hypocrisy.” 
    (Narrated by Muslim, 654) Not responding to the muezzin implies weakness of 
    faith, lack of religious commitment, not caring about reward and forsaking 
    the houses of Allaah.

     With regard to the ruling on one who prays Jumu’ah only, 
    some of the scholars are of the view that one who prays Jumu’ah only is a 
    kaafir, because he comes under the same ruling as one who does not pray at 
    all, because he prays only one of the thirty-five prayers required each 
    week, so he is like one who does not pray at all. Among those who expressed 
    this view were Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz and Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may 
    Allaah have mercy on them). Some of the scholars said that he is not a 
    kaafir but he is committing a great sin that is worse than riba (usury), 
    adultery, stealing, drinking alcohol etc.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
10296,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10296,Those who follow madhhabs and refuse to learn,"What should we say to those people who continuously follow Mazhab and who say that :""we are too weak to follow Daleels,  only scholars can follow Daleels as they know them very well""...  What should be our response to these people who are learning the DEEN but through Mazhab glasses...",,,"Praise be to Allah.The regular Muslim who cannot access the proofs (daleels) or understand them in the way that scholars do is obliged to consult and follow the scholars. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“So ask of those who know the Scripture, if you do not know” [al-Nahl 16:43]
But in the case  of those who can arrive at the correct view on a matter by examining the evidence, it is not permissible for them to follow, unless they do not have the time to research the matter. In that case, they come under the same ruling as a regular Muslim who does not have enough knowledge.
 -Shaykh ‘Abd al-Kareemal-Khudayr
 There is nothing wrong with learning fiqh according to one of the four madhhabs, on condition that one follows the daleel (evidence) if it becomes apparent that the madhhab says something contrary to the daleel on a given matter, because obedience to Allaah and His Messenger comes before obedience to anyone else. It is also essential to have good manners towards other schools of thought and not to develop sectarian attitudes in opposing them. He should make the truth his aim and respect the opinions and efforts (ijtihaad) of the scholars. He should make discussing matters with them in a polite manner his method of reaching the truth, and he should advise people in a polite way if he thinks that they are mistaken.
 It is wrong for a person who is able to learn to refuse to do so on the grounds that only the scholars are able to understand the daleel. We do not say to one who is unable to engage in ijtihaad that he has to strive to derive rulings from the texts when he does not have the ability to do that and does not understand the principles; otherwise chaos would reign. But we do say that if you have some knowledge and understanding, you should at least know what the proof and daleel of your imaam (whom you are following) is, so that you can see the connection with the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and you can follow with some measure of insight and not be merely a bind follower.
