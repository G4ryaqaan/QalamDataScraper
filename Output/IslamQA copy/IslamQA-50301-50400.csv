50305,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50305,He said to his wife: “You are to me like my mother”,A woman’s husband said to her: “You are to me like my mother.” Is this regarded as a talaaq divorce or is there expiation for it? What is the expiation?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
This phrase 
    is not regarded as a talaaq divorce, rather it is a kind of zihaar [a 
    jaahili form of divorce in which the husband says to his wife, “You are to 
    me as my mother’s back”] which is not explicitly zihaar, rather it may be 
    understood as zihaar or as something else. 
Secondly: 
The ruling 
    on this phrase depends on the intention of the speaker (the husband) and the 
    context. 
As for the 
    intention, if the husband intended by saying that that she was forbidden to 
    him like his mother, then it is zihaar. 
Or he may 
    have meant that she is like his mother in honour and love etc, in which case 
    it is not zihaar, and does not mean anything.  
As for 
    context, if the context of words and events that came before this indicate 
    that the husband intended zihaar, then it is zihaar. Examples of such 
    contexts are: if the husband was having an argument with his wife and during 
    that argument he said, “You are to me like my mother.” This context suggests 
    that he intended zihaar so it is zihaar, 
Shaykh 
    al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah was asked in Majmoo’ al-Fataawa (34/5) about a 
    man who said to his wife: “You are to me like my mother or my sister.” He 
    replied: If what he meant was you are to me like my mother or my sister in 
    terms of honour, then he does not have to do anything, but if what he meant 
    was likening her to his mother or sister in terms of marriage, then this is 
    zihaar and he has to do the same as the one who divorces his wife by zihaar: 
    if he chooses to keep her, he should not approach her until he has offered 
    the expiation for zihaar.  End quote. 
He also said 
    (34/7): 
If he meant 
    when he said, “you are like my mother to me” that he would refrain from 
    physical relations with her which are forbidden in the case of the mother, 
    then this is zihaar and he is obliged to do what the man who divorces his 
    wife by zihaar is obliged to do. It is not permissible for him to have 
    intercourse with her until he has offered the expiation for zihaar, namely 
    freeing a slave. If that is not possible then he must fast for two 
    consecutive months. If he cannot do that then he must feed sixty poor 
    persons. End quote. 
Ibn Qudaamah 
    said in al-Mughni (11/60): 
If he says: 
    You are to me like my mother, intending zihaar thereby, then it is zihaar, 
    according to the majority of scholars, including Abu Haneefah and his two 
    companions, al-Shaafa’i and Ishaaq. If he intended thereby to show honour 
    and respect, or to say that she is like her in age or in some other way, 
    then this is not zihaar. What matters is what he says about his intention. 
    End quote. 
i.e., the 
    husband is the one who has to clarify what he intended. 
It says in
    Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (20/274): 
If the 
    husband says to his wife: I am your brother or You are my sister or You are 
    my mother or like my mother, or You are to me like my mother or my sister, 
    if he means thereby that she is like them in honour, family ties or respect, 
    or he did not have any particular intention, or there is no context to 
    suggest that he intended zihaar, then this does not result in zihaar and he 
    does not have to do anything. But if he intended zihaar with these or 
    similar words, or there is a context that indicates zihaar, such as these 
    words being uttered in anger or as a threat to her, then it is zihaar. This 
    is haraam and he must repent, and also offer expiation before he touches 
    her. The expiation is to free a slave; if that is not possible then he must 
    fast for two consecutive months. If he cannot do that then he must feed 
    sixty poor persons. End quote. 
To sum up: 
If the 
    husband intended zihaar by these words, or if there is a context that points 
    to that, then it is zihaar. If it is other than that, then it is not zihaar 
    and he does not have to do anything. 
Thirdly: 
Zihaar is 
    haraam, and Allaah has described it as an ill word and a lie, and He says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Those 
    among you who make their wives unlawful to them by Zihaar (i.e., by saying 
    to them “You are like my mother’s back,”) they cannot be their mothers. None 
    can be their mothers except those who gave them birth. And verily, they 
    utter an ill word and a lie”

    [al-Mujaadilah 58:2]
The one who 
    speaks the words of zihaar to his wife has to repent to Allaah, may He be 
    exalted.
Fourthly: 
The husband 
    who divorces his wife by zihaar has to offer expiation if he wants to keep 
    her and not divorce her and it is not permissible for him to have 
    intercourse with her until he has offered expiation. The expiation is to 
    free a slave. If that is not possible then he must fast for two consecutive 
    months. If he cannot do that then he must feed sixty poor persons. The 
    evidence for that is the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 
“And 
    those who make unlawful to them (their wives) by Zihaar and wish to free 
    themselves from what they uttered, (the penalty) in that case is the freeing 
    of a slave before they touch each other. That is an admonition to you (so 
    that you may not repeat such an ill thing). And Allaah is All‑Aware of what 
    you do.
4. And he 
    who finds not (the money for freeing a slave) must fast two successive 
    months before they both touch each other. And he who is unable to do so, 
    should feed sixty Masaakeen (poor). That is in order that you may have 
    perfect faith in Allaah and His Messenger. These are the limits set by 
    Allaah. And for disbelievers, there is a painful torment”

50308,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50308,40-Day Rule after Birth in Islam: When Can Women Pray and Fast?,"My wife gave birth around the 15th of Shaطban. Is it permissible for her to pray, fast, do ‘umrah, read Quran and do all other duties prescribed in Islam when the nifas (post-partum bleeding) stops and she is sure of that, or should she wait for 40 days as some people say?","If a woman in nifas sees that she has become pure before 40 days are over, then she should do ghusl and pray and fast, and her husband may have intercourse with her.","Is there a minimum length of nifas in Islam?


Can women pray and fast if blood stops before 40 days of nifas?","Praise be to Allah.Is there a minimum length of nifas in Islam?
The majority of scholars, including the four imams, are of the view that there is no minimum limit for nifas. Whenever a woman becomes pure from nifas, she has to do ghusl and pray and fast, even if that is before forty days have passed since the birth . Because no precise definition has been narrated in the Shari`ah with regard to the minimum length of nifas, so the matter should be based on experience, which shows that nifas may be very short or it may be long. (Ibn Qudamah in al-Mughni, 1/428)
Some of the scholars narrated that there was consensus on this point. Al-Tirmidhi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“The scholars among the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), the Successors and those who came after them are agreed that a woman in nifas should stop praying for forty days, unless she sees that she has become pure before that, in which case she should do ghusl and pray.” (Al-Majmu’ by al-Nawawi, 2/541)
Can women pray and fast if blood stops before 40 days of nifas?
Shaykh Ibn Baz (15/195) was asked: is it permissible for a woman in nifas to pray, fast and do Hajj before forty days if she becomes pure (i.e., if the bleeding stops)? 
He replied: 
“Yes, it is permissible for her to fast, pray and do Hajj and ‘umrah, and it is permissible for her husband to have intercourse with her within forty days , if she becomes pure. If she becomes pure after twenty days, she should do ghusl and pray and fast , and she is permissible for her husband. The report from ‘Uthman ibn Abi’l-As which says that he regarded that as makruh is to be understood as meaning disliked but not forbidden; this is his ijtihad, but there is no evidence for that. 
The correct view is that there is nothing wrong with that if the woman becomes pure before forty days. If the bleeding resumes within forty days, then the correct view is that she should regard it as nifas within the 40-day period, but her fasts, prayers and Hajj at the time when she was pure are still valid and she does not have to repeat any of them, so long as they were done when she was pure.”
It says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah (5/458): 
“If a woman in nifas sees that she has become pure before 40 days are over, then she should do ghusl and pray and fast , and her husband may have intercourse with her .” 
The Standing Committee (10/155) was asked about a woman who gave birth seven days before Ramadan, then she became pure and fasted Ramadan. 
They replied: 
“If the matter is as described and she fasted Ramadan at a time when she was pure, then her fast is valid and she does not have to make it up.”

50312,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50312,Do the rulings on travellers apply to one who intends to stay for three days?,"I am going to travel for ‘Umrah for a short time – three days. Do the rulings on travellers apply to me, and can I shorten my prayers during my stay in Makkah?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The scholars differed concerning the length of time during 
    which, if a traveller stays in a place, he may shorten his prayers. Shaykh 
    Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: 

    This is one of the issues concerning which the scholars 
    differed, and there are more then twenty different scholarly opinions. The 
    reason for that is that there is no definitive evidence that would dispel 
    confusion. Hence the views of the scholars differed. I will mention the 
    views of the main madhhabs: 

    1 – The view of the Hanbalis (may Allaah have mercy on them) 
    is that if a person intends to stay for more than four days, the ruling on 
    travel no longer applies to him and he must offer the prayers in full. 

    2 – The view of al-Shaafa’i and Maalik is that if he intends 
    to stay for four days or more, then he must offer the prayers in full, but 
    the day of arrival and the day of departure are not included in that. Based 
    on that, the total number of days during which one may shorten prayers is 
    six days: the day of arrival, the day of departure, and the four days in 
    between. 

    3 – The view of Abu Haneefah is that if he intends to stay 
    for more than fifteen days he should offer the prayers in full, and if he 
    intends to stay for a shorter time then he may shorten his prayers. 

    Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 4/545 

    So it is clear that the views of the main madhhabs are agreed 
    that it is permissible to shorten one’s prayers if one intends to stay for 
    three days or less. 

    See al-Majmoo’, 3/171; Bidaayat al-Mujtahid, 
    1/168. 
Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said 
    in his commentary on the hadeeth of al-‘Ala’ ibn al-Hadrami, according to 
    which the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “Three days for the muhaajir after returning from Mina.”  (Narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari, 3933 and Muslim, 1352): 

    What this hadeeth refers to is that staying Makkah was 
    forbidden to one who had migrated therefrom before the Conquest, but it was 
    permitted to those who went there for Hajj or ‘Umrah to stay after 
    completing the rituals (of Hajj or ‘Umrah) for three days and no more. It 
    was understood from this that if a person stays for three days, the rulings 
    on travellers still apply to him. 

    Fath al-Baari, 7/267. 
If your stay is not 
    going to exceed three days, then you can avail yourself of the concession 
    granted to travellers according to the four madhhabs. And Allaah knows 
    best.

50320,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50320,"He did ghusl and prayed, then he realized that he had missed a part of his body and the water had not reached it","Is continuing the ghusl after it has been already done permissible? I mean if someone remembers after he finished ghusl that a part of his body was not washed, should he just wash this part, or repeat the whole ghusl knowing it is tiring?  

My case was that I had a sticker on a wound on my back. I removed the sticker and the glue that it leaves behind. Initially I thought that I removed it totally, and made ghusl. I realized some time afterwards that I did not remove the glue completely, knowing that the water passed on this part. What should I do? (I mean does the glue of a sticker stop the water touching the skin?).",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    The fuqaha’ have stated that it is essential 
    to remove everything that may prevent the water from reaching the parts of 
    the body that must be washed in order for ghusl or wudoo’ to be valid, 
    because washing the parts of the body cannot be achieved otherwise. 

    Al-Nawawi said: If there is wax, dough, 
    henna and the like on one of his limbs, which prevents water from reaching 
    any part of it, then his tahaarah is not valid, whether the amount is large 
    or small. If there are traces of henna and its colour left on the hand, 
    without there being any solid material left, or elsewhere, or traces of 
    liquid grease whereby water flows over the limb but does not stay there, his 
    tahaarah is valid. End quote.  

    End quote from al-Mughni (1/529). 

    Secondly: 

    With regard to the ruling on the prayers you 
    offered when this glue was still on you, it depends. If the glue was thick 
    and prevented water from reaching the skin, then you should regard the 
    prayer as invalid and you have to repeat them. But if it was a small amount 
    and did not prevent the water from reaching the skin, then the prayer is 
    valid. You can determine that because you can see it, but if you are 
    uncertain, then to be on the safe side you may repeat the prayers. 

    Thirdly: 

    The scholars differed concerning the ruling 
    on sequence of washing in ghusl. There are two opinions: 

    
    1 – That washing the parts in sequence is not essential. This is the view of 
    most of the scholars as was stated in al-Mughni (1/220) where it is 
    the favoured view. Shaykh al-Islam also said that in Sharh al-‘Uddah 
    (1/208) and quoted a great deal of evidence for that, which you will find in 
    the answer to question no. 
    
    99543. 
    According to this view, if a person omits to wash a part of his body then 
    remembers it after that, it is sufficient for him to wash only the area that 
    he omitted, and he does not have to repeat ghusl.",Islam Q&A
50326,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50326,Ongoing contraception is haraam except in cases of necessity,"I suffer from a severe sickness during pregnancy, that lasts almost until the moment of birth, especially in the first three months. It was so bad that I spent almost two months in hospital. During this time, I stopped eating and drinking completely, and I disliked everything. I was fed by means of injections in the hospital. In this case is it permissible for me to avoid getting pregnant and giving birth altogether, or is that not permitted?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
Islam encourages people to get married and have children so as to increase the numbers of the Muslim ummah and to make the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) proud before all other nations on the Day of Resurrection, and in accordance with human nature (fitrah). The Prophets themselves (blessings and peace of Allaah be upon them) asked Allaah to bless them with righteous offspring. Allaah tells us that Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) said: 
“My Lord! Grant me (offspring) from the righteous”
[al-Saaffaat 37:100]. 
And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And (remember) Zakariyya (Zachariah), when he cried to his Lord: ‘O My Lord! Leave me not single (childless), though You are the Best of the inheritors’”
[al-Anbiya’ 21:89.] 
Allaah tells us of many of the du’aa’s of the righteous, such as the verse in which He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And those who say: “Our Lord! Bestow on us from our wives and our offspring the comfort of our eyes, and make us leaders of the Muttaqoon (the pious)”
[al-Furqaan 25:74]. 
People will remain like that so long as their nature (fitrah) remains sound. 
Secondly: 
In the answer to question no. 21169 we stated that ongoing contraception is haraam. 
But an exception is made to that in cases of necessity – as is the shar’i principle with regard to all haraam things, as it allows them in cases of necessity. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“He has explained to you in detail what is forbidden to you, except under compulsion of necessity”
[al-An’aam 6:119]. 
So if a woman is weak or sick and will be harmed by pregnancy or there is fear for her life because of that, then it is permissible for her to use that which will prevent pregnancy. 
In research prepared by the Standing Committee for Academic research and Issuing Fatwas it says: 
… Based on that, limiting the number of offspring is haraam in general, and contraception may be haraam except in rare individual cases that are not general in application, such as if the pregnant woman will have to give birth in a manner other than that which is usual, and she will have to have surgery to bring the child forth; or if the woman’s health or life will be at risk due to pregnancy. In such cases contraception is permitted as anexception because of the likelihood of harm, so as to preserve her life, because Islam seeks to bring benefits and ward off harms, and to advance the greater of benefits and reduce the harm in the case of a conflict. End quote. 
Majallat al-Buhooth al-Islamiyyah (5/127). 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz was asked about a woman who had given birth to ten children, and now pregnancy would cause her harm, and she wanted to have an operation to have her tubes tied. 
He replied: 
There is nothing wrong with her having the surgery mentioned, if doctors have determined that giving birth will harm her, and if her husband allows that. End quote. 
Fataawa al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah (5/978). 
Shaykh Ibn Jibreen said: 
It is not permissible to have surgery to end or prevent pregnancy except in cases of necessity, when trustworthy doctors have established that giving birth will harm her or make her sickness worse, or there is the fear that pregnancy and childbirth will likely lead to her death. But it is essential that the husband give his approval to the ending or prevention of pregnancy. Then when the excuse ends the woman should go back to normal. End quote. 
Fataawa al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah (2/977). 
Based on this, if what happened to you was caused by pregnancy, then it is a passing thing that was caused by sickness or weakness which it is hoped will pass. In that case you can use contraceptives on a temporary basis, until Allaah heals you. But if it is an ongoing problem for which there is no hope of an end, then there is nothing wrong – in sha Allaah – with you using contraception on an ongoing basis.

Can a menstruating woman fast?


Why can't a woman fast on her period?","Praise be to Allah.Muslims must submit to the rulings of Allah
The believer has to submit to the ruling of Allah and accept it even if he does not know the reason behind it; rather it should be sufficient for him that Allah and His Messenger have commanded it. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“It is not for a believer, man or woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decreed a matter that they should have any option in their decision. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, he has indeed strayed into a plain error.” [al-Ahzab 33:36] 
“The only saying of the faithful believers, when they are called to Allah (His Words, the Quran) and His Messenger , to judge between them, is that they say: ‘We hear and we obey.’ And such are the successful (who will live forever in Paradise).” [al-Nur 24:51]
There is wisdom behind every ruling
The believer should believe with certainty of faith that Allah is Wise and that He does prescribe anything except in accordance with His ultimate wisdom, and He does not enjoin anything except that which is in people’s best interests and He does not forbid anything except to protect people  from its harm and evil. How well Ibn Kathir put it in al-Bidayah wa'l-Nihayah (6/79) when he said:  
“The law of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the most complete of laws; it did not leave any good thing that is recognized by the wise as being good but it enjoined it, and it did not leave any evil thing that is recognized by the wise as being evil but it forbade it. It has not enjoined anything of which people could say, ‘Would that this were not enjoined,’ and it has not forbidden anything of which people could say, ‘Would that this were not forbidden.’ 
We may understand the reasons, or they may be hidden from us, and most or part of them may be hidden from us. 
Can a menstruating woman fast?
The scholars unanimously agreed that it is forbidden for a menstruating woman to fast , and that she has to make up the days that she misses because of menstruation if that was an obligatory fast, as in Ramadan. 
They also agreed that if she does fast, her fast is not valid . 
Why can't a woman fast on her period?
The scholars differed as to the reason why the fast of a menstruating woman is not valid.  
Some of them said that the reason is not known to us. 
Imam al-Haramayn said: “We do not know why her fast is not valid, because purity is not a prerequisite for it.” (Al-Majmu’, 2/386) 
Others said: The reason why Allah has forbidden menstruating women to fast at the time of their period is out of mercy towards them, because loss of blood weakens them and if a woman were to fast when menstruating, she would be weakened both by menstruation and by fasting, in which case fasting would be an unfair burden and may even be harmful. 
Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah] said in Majmu’ al-Fatawa (25/234): 
“With regard to menstruation we say: 
Islam brings moderation in all things, and going to extremes in worship is a kind of unfairness that the Lawgiver forbids, and commands us to be moderate in worship. Hence Islam tells us to hasten breaking the fast and to delay suhur, and it forbids continual fasting. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The best and most moderate of fasting is the fast of Dawud (peace be upon him). He used to fast alternate days and he would not flee when meeting the enemy.” Moderation in worship is one of the greatest aims of the Lawgiver. Hence Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Make not unlawful the Tayyibat (all that is good as regards foods, things, deeds, beliefs, persons) which Allah has made lawful to you, and transgress not. Verily, Allah does not like the transgressors.” [al-Maidah 5:67]
Forbidding permitted things is regarded as a transgression which goes against moderation. And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“For the wrongdoing of the Jews, We made unlawful for them certain good foods which had been lawful for them — and for their hindering many from Allah’s Way; And their taking of Riba (usury) though they were forbidden from taking it.” [al-Nisa 4:160]
Because they went astray, they were punished by being forbidden good things, unlike the ummah that follows the middle way, for whom good things are allowed and bad things are forbidden. As this is the case, the fasting person is forbidden to eat and drink things that strengthen him and nourish him, and he is forbidden to deliberately cause his body to eject things that may weaken him. Otherwise if he were allowed to do that, he would be a transgressor and one who goes to extremes in his worship, and he would not be moderate. 
Things that come out of the body are of two types. The first type is those that are unavoidable or which come out in a manner that does not cause any harm. There is nothing wrong with these, like urine and stools, because they do not cause any harm and they cannot be avoided. If they need to come out, that does not harm a person, rather it benefits him; the same applies if a person vomits and cannot help it, or experiences a wet dream, which also cannot be helped. But if a person vomits deliberately and ejects the food and drink that give him nourishment, or masturbates accompanied by feelings of desire.
A menstruating woman can fast at a time other than the times when she is bleeding, because then she will be fasting at a time when she is in a good state, when she is not losing blood which gives strength to the body. Fasting at the time when she is bleeding would weaken her physically and would mean that she is fasting at a time when she is not in a good state, so she is commanded to fast at times other than menstruation.”

50388,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50388,Why did Allah Single out Fasting for Himself?,"What is special about fasting so that Allah singled it out when He said, ‘Fasting is for Me and I shall reward for it.’?","Allah singled out fasting for Himself from all other good deeds, because of its honoured status before Him, because He loves it and because it is a demonstration of sincerity towards Him, as it is a secret between a person and his Lord, which no one can see except Allah.",,"Praise be to Allah.Al-Bukhari (1761) and Muslim (1946) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah said: ‘Every deed of the son of Adam is for him except fasting; it is for Me and I shall reward for it…’” 
Because all deeds are for the sake of Allah and He is the One Who rewards for them, the scholars differed concerning this phrase, “Fasting is for Me and I shall reward for it ” – why is fasting singled out in this manner? 
Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) quoted the views of ten scholars who sought to explain the meaning of this Hadith and why fasting was singled out in this manner. 
The most important of these views are as follows: 
·        That there is no showing off in fasting as may happen in other acts of worship. 
Al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Because showing off may enter into all good deeds , but no one can see when a person is fasting except Allah, so Allah connected it to Himself. Hence He said in the Hadith, “He gives up his desire for My sake.”
Ibn Al-Jawzi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “All acts of worship can be seen when done, and they may be contaminated with some element of showing off, unlike fasting.” 
·        That what is meant by the words, “I shall reward for it” is: I am the only One Who knows the extent of his reward and how much his good deeds will be multiplied. 
Al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “What this means is that the amount of reward for good deeds may become known to people, and they will be rewarded between ten and seven hundred fold, and as much as Allah wants, except fasting, for Allah will reward it without measure. This is supported by a report narrated by Muslim (115) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Every deed of the son of Adam will be rewarded between ten and seven hundred fold. Allah said: ‘Except fasting, for it is for Me and I shall reward for it’” – i.e., I shall reward it greatly, without specifying how much. This is like the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Only those who are patient shall receive their reward in full, without reckoning.” [Az-Zumar 39:10]
·        That what is meant by “fasting is for Me” is that it is the dearest of acts of worship to Me.
Ibn `Abd Al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The words “Fasting is for Me” are sufficient to indicate the superiority of fasting over all other acts of worship.” 
An-Nasa’i (2220) narrated that Abu Umamah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “You should fast, for there is nothing like it.” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih An-Nasa’i.) 
·        That fasting is mentioned in conjunction with Allah by way of honouring, as we say, “the House of Allah,” although all houses belong to Allah. 
Az-Zayn ibn Al-Munir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Giving a specific meaning to something general in a context such as this can only be understood as being by way of honouring.” 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
This Hadith points to the virtue of fasting in numerous ways: 
1.      Allah singled out fasting for Himself from all other good deeds, because of its honoured status before Him, because He loves it and because it is a demonstration of sincerity towards Him, as it is a secret between a person and his Lord, which no one can see except Allah. The fasting person may be in a place with no other people around, and he could eat or drink that which Allah has forbidden to the fasting person, but he does not do that, because he knows that he has a Lord Who can see him even though he is alone and Who has forbidden that to him. So he forsakes it for the sake of Allah and fearing His punishment, seeking His reward. Because of that, Allah appreciates his sincerity and singled out fasting for Himself from among all other good deeds. Hence He said: “He gives up his desires and his food for My sake.”  
The benefit of this singling out will be seen on the Day of Resurrection, as Sufyan ibn ‘Uyaynah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: When the Day of Resurrection comes, Allah will bring His slave to account and will settle any scores outstanding from the rest of his deeds, until when there is nothing left but fasting, Allah will settle the matter and will admit him to Paradise by virtue of his fasting. 
2.                Allah said concerning fasting: “I shall reward him for it.” So he connected the reward for fasting to Himself, because the reward for righteous deeds is mentioned by number, and a good deed will be rewarded between ten and seven hundred fold, many times. But with regard to fasting, Allah connected the reward to Himself without specifying any number. Allah is the most generous of those who are generous, and the gift reflects the generosity of the giver. So the reward of the one who fasts will be very great, without reckoning. Fasting is patience in obeying Allah, patience in keeping away from the things forbidden by Allah, and patience in bearing the decree of Allah, hunger, thirst, physical and mental weakness. So it combines all three types of patience, thus the fasting person deserves to be counted as one of the patient, and Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Only those who are patient shall receive their reward in full, without reckoning.” [Az-Zumar 39:10]” (Majalis Shahr Ramadan, p. 13)

50398,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50398,He works in a mixed environment and is worried about his fast,I work in a company where there is no other man but me. Does my mixing with women have any effect on my fast?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Mixing 
    between men and women in the workplace has obvious bad effects on both men 
    and women. These include the following: 
1 – Haraam 
    looks. Allaah has commanded the believers, men and women, to lower their 
    gaze. Allaah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Tell the 
    believing men to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and 
    protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts). That is purer for 
    them. Verily, Allaah is All‑Aware of what they do.
31. And 
    tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden 
    things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts) and not 
    to show off their adornment except only that which is apparent”
    [al-Noor 24:30, 31]
In Saheeh 
    Muslim (2159) it is narrated that Jareer ibn ‘Abd-Allaah (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) said: I asked the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) about an accidental glance and he told me 
    to avert my gaze. 
2 – There 
    may be haraam touching, which includes shaking hands. The Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “For one of you to be 
    struck in the head with an iron needle would be better for him than touching 
    a woman who is not permissible for him.” Narrated by al-Tabaraani from the 
    hadeeth of Ma’qil ibn Yasaar; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh 
    al-Jaami’, no. 5045. 
3 – Mixing 
    may lead to a man being alone with a woman who is not his mahram, which is 
    haraam, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said: “No man is alone with a woman but the Shaytaan is the third one 
    present.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2165; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in
    Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
According to 
    another report: “Whoever believes in Allaah and the Last Day, let him not be 
    alone with a woman who does not have a mahram with her, for the third one 
    present will be the Shaytaan.” Narrated by Ahmad and classed as saheeh by 
    al-Haakim, and al-Dhahabi agreed with him. Also classed as saheeh by 
    al-Albaani in Ghaayat al-Maraam, 180. 
4 – Another 
    of its evil results is that a man may become attracted to and infatuated 
    with a woman, or vice versa, which is as a result of mixing and lengthy 
    interaction. 
5 – It also 
    results in destruction of families. How many men have neglected their homes 
    and families because of being attracted to a colleague at school or at work. 
    How many women have neglected their husbands and homes, for the same reason. 
    How many cases of divorce have occurred because of haraam relationships 
    engaged in by the husband or wife, where mixing at work was the thing that 
    led to it. 
For these 
    and other reasons, Islam forbids mixing that can lead to these evil 
    consequences. We have quoted the evidence for the prohibition on mixing in 
    detail in the answer to question no. 
    1200. 
Based on 
    this, our advice to you is to leave this mixed workplace and look for 
    another job where you will be free from these haraam things. You should also 
    be certain that whoever gives up something for the sake of Allaah, Allaah 
    will compensate him with something better than it, and whoever fears Allaah, 
    Allaah will grant him a way out from every difficulty. 
“And 
    whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him 
    to get out (from every difficulty).
3. And He 
    will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine”

    [al-Talaaq 65:2-3]
If you have 
    to stay in this job, then fear Allaah and lower your gaze and do not look at 
    women. Avoid shaking hands with them or being alone with them, ands remember 
    that Allaah is always watching. Remember that He knows what is secret and 
    what is yet more hidden, and He “knows the fraud of the eyes, and all 
    that the hearts conceal” [Ghaafir 40:19]. 
May Allaah 
    guide us to fear Him, and to remain chaste and independent of means.
And Allaah
