34151,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34151,His wife is weak in religious commitment – what should he do?,"I am a young man, thirty years old. Before I got married I was not committed, but now – praise be to Allaah – I have been blessed with guidance. I got married to a girl who graduated from the Faculty of Islamic Studies and I was happy about that because I thought that she would help me to obey Allaah. But after getting to know her, I found out that she is a very ordinary girl and she is not committed at all, and she has many negative qualities, such as: 
She cannot denounce any evil action, whether major or minor. Rather she even does some evil actions such as watching TV, gossiping, and doing few acts of worship. But she also has some good qualities, such as being good and patient, and she performs all her wifely duties and takes care of the house. 
What upsets me is that I wanted someone who would help me to be more committed by marrying a woman who was religiously committed, but I found that the one who I thought was religiously committed needs someone to help her.  
This is my problem. I hope that you can help me find a solution. Thank you very much.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The problem that you describe is one that is faced by many young men who thought that their wives could learn and make da’wah, and that they would strive hard in worship and help their husbands to be religiously-committed, no matter how much the husband fell short in that. But in fact the wife cannot be influenced by anybody as much as her husband. So if the husband does not set a good example, the wife’s commitment will soon become weak. This is what usually happens. This does not mean that there are not good situations in which the woman is the example who leads her husband along the path of guidance. 
The fact that you have found out that your wife is an ordinary girl does not mean that you have failed, and it should not be a cause of regret. Rather that should be a motive for you to seek the reward for calling her to guidance. 
What you have mentioned of her good qualities will help you to achieve that, in sha Allaah. 
So you should be the one who calls her, reminds her and advises her… fill her free time with beneficial things such as tapes, books and magazines.  Do not give up on rebuking her if she gossips or watches TV, but do that in a gentle, compassionate and loving manner. 
Try to make her join an organization for memorization of Qur’aan, or get her to attend public lectures with you, or to form ties with some righteous families. These are the best ways in which you can help your wife to strengthen her faith. 
Perhaps what you mention about her not worshipping much is related to your own shortcomings in that regard, or to your neglecting to get her to join in. Try to help her and remind her of the virtue of naafil prayers, the reward for praying qiyaam al-layl and fasting. Do as many of these acts of worship with her as you can. 
Be the qawwaam (leader; protector and maintainer) of your wife, prevent her  from doing haraam things or doubtful things.  
Ask of Allaah, saying, “Our Lord! Bestow on us from our wives and our offspring the comfort of our eyes, and make us leaders of the Muttaqoon (the pious)” [al-Furqaan 25:74 – interpretation of the meaning].

34154,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34154,Ruling on calling Mount ‘Arafah Jabal al-Rahmah,"Some people call Mount ‘Arafah Jabal al-Rahmah (the Mount of Mercy). What is the ruling on this name, and is there any basis for that?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) answered this question by 
    saying: 
I do not know of any basis for this name in 
    the Sunnah, i.e., that the mountain in ‘Arafah, by which the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stood, is called Jabal 
    al-Rahmah (the Mount of Mercy). Since there is no basis for that in the Sunnah, it should not be called by that name. Perhaps those who call it 
    thus realize that this is a great standing in which those who stand at ‘Arafah receive the forgiveness and mercy of Allaah, so they called it by 
    this name. But it is better not to use this name, rather it should be called Jabal ‘Arafah (Mount ‘Arafah), or the mountain by which the Prophet

Is it permissible to bring them closer together and stand in between them in the row so as to close the gap?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded us to make 
    the rows straight and to close the gaps in them, and to complete the first row, then subsequent rows. That is mentioned in well-known ahaadeeth, 
    such as that narrated by al-Bukhaari (690) and Muslim (433) from Anas, that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “Make your rows straight, for straightening the rows is part of the perfection of prayer.” According to the version narrated by al-Bukhaari: “… is 
    part of the establishing of prayer.” 
Ahmad (12374), Abu Dawood (671) and al-Nasaa’i (818) narrated from Anas that the 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Complete the first row, then the next one, and if there is to be any 
    incomplete row let it be the last row.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
Ahmad (5724) and Abu Dawood (666) narrated from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar that the 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Straighten the rows, for you form rows like the angels, and keep your 
    shoulders in line with one another, and fill the gaps, and do not leave any room for the Shaytaan. Whoever joins a row to complete it, Allaah will 
    take care of him and whoever interrupts a row, Allaah will cut him off.” This hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
Based on this, then your bringing worshippers closer to one another and filling 
    the gap in the row is an act that is prescribed in sharee’ah, so long as that does not lead to crowding the worshippers and annoying them.

34161,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34161,She committed a haraam action with a man thinking that she was helping him and being kind,"I am a girl of good character, praise be to Allaah. But one of my faults is that I love people more than is necessary and I cannot bear to see anyone suffering without sharing his pain. At work there is a young man who is sick with a sexually-transmitted disease. I got close to him and he got close to me so that I could reduce his pain and be kind to him, and I tried to help him but without getting involved sexually with him. I know that this is haraam, but is this zina? How should I deal with this young man who is with me at work all day long? 

Please note that I have asked Allaah to forgive me for what I have done and I now fast every Monday and Thursday, and I pray and hope that Allaah will forgive me. I am now confused and I do not know whether Allaah will forgive me or what.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Undoubtedly you have committed a grievous 
    sin, in fact a number of sins, starting with your speaking to this man about these sexual matters, and ending with what you did to treat him. The 
    Shaytaan has gradually led you astray and made you fall into evil; he has deceived you and made it look to you as if you are helping others and 
    being kind to them. 
No matter how soft-hearted a person may be, 
    no matter how sensitive towards others, there are limits that must not be crossed. 
We understand from your question that you 
    work in a place where you mix with men. This is where evil begins. Perhaps this is an example of the evil consequences of women mixing with men at 
    work. See also question no. 1200 and 
    6666. 
You should note that it is not permissible 
    for women to speak with men except for necessary purposes, when it should be done in a decorous and dignified manner, without speaking in a soft 
    tone, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“then be not soft in speech, lest he in whose heart is a disease (of hypocrisy, or evil desire 
    for adultery) should be moved with desire, but speak in an honourable manner”
[al-Ahzaab 33:32]
If speaking in a soft manner is forbidden, 
    then what about a woman speaking to a man about sex and sexual diseases?! 
You must strive to leave this mixed work 
    place and cut off all ties with this man whose lack of religious commitment is worse than any physical problems he may be suffering. 
With regard to the question of whether what 
    you have done is zina or not, the answer is what the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, according to the hadeeth 
    narrated by al-Bukhaari (5744) and Muslim (4801) from Abu Hurayrah: “Allaah has decreed for the son of Adam his share of zina, which will 
    inevitably catch up with him. The zina of the eyes is looking and the zina of the tongue is speaking. The nafs (self) wishes and desires, and the 
    private parts confirm that or deny it.” 
Al-Nawawi said: 
The meaning of this hadeeth is that the son 
    of Adam has his share of zina decreed for him. Some of them commit zina in real terms, by engaging in illicit sexual intercourse. Some of them 
    commit zina in a figurative sense by looking at haraam things or listening to stories or songs of zina and anything that may lead to it, or by 
    touching or kissing a non-mahram woman, or by speaking in a haraam fashion with a non-mahram woman, and so on. These are all kinds of figurative 
    zina, and the private part confirms that or denies it meaning that zina with the private parts may take place or may not. And Allaah knows best. 
But by Allaah’s mercy towards His slaves He 
    opens to them the door of repentance and seeking forgiveness, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And verily, I am indeed forgiving to him 
    who repents, believes (in My Oneness, and associates none in worship with Me) and does righteous good deeds, and then remains constant in doing 
    them (till his death)”
    [Ta-Ha 20:82] 
“And whosoever repents and does righteous 
    good deeds; then verily, he repents towards Allaah with true repentance”
[al-Furqaan 25:71]
You said that you have repented to Allaah, so do a lot of righteous deeds, so that Allaah may 
    forgive you. Part of repentance means cutting all ties with this man and asking to be transferred away from the place where he works, indeed to be 
    transferred away from a mixed workplace altogether, as stated above.

34164,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34164,He thought of divorcing his wife,"I had an argument with my wife about doing the laundry. I want her to wash the clothes and she does not want to do it. After a lot of arguing and shouting I went to a different room and thought of telling her, “You will be divorced if you wash them this month, I will wash them myself.” But I did not tell her what I had said to myself, and I did not say it in a loud voice. I could hardly hear myself saying it. I did that to stop the argument about the laundry, because she is very argumentative and I did not mean to divorce her, only to scare her. All of that happened to me in a moment of anger. If she does the laundry will that mean she is divorced or is it just a vow (yameen)?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Divorce does not happen just because you said 
    that to yourself or you thought about it, or decided to do it but did not utter the words. 
That is because the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah will forgive my ummah for whatever crosses their minds and whatever they think of, so long as they 
    do not act upon it or speak it out loud.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6664; Muslim, 127. 
Ibn Qudaamah said: What that means is that 
    divorce can only take place if the words are spoken out loud. If a man intends that in his heart but does not utter the words, then divorce does 
    not take place, according to the majority of scholars, including ‘Ata’, Jaabir ibn Zayd, Sa’eed ibn Jubayr, Yahya ibn Abi Katheer, al-Shaafa’i, 
    and Ishaaq. This was also narrated from al-Qaasim, Saalim, al-Hasan and al-Shu’bi. 
Al-Mughni, 
    7/294. 
From your words, “I did not say it in a loud 
    voice. I could hardly hear myself saying it” we understand that you did utter these words, but in a soft voice. If that is the case, then what you 
    said is regarded as meaning that you did divorce her, subject to the condition, which is that she washes the clothes. But you said that you did 
    not intend to divorce her, only to scare her. Based on this, the ruling on this divorce is that of a vow (yameen): if she washes your clothes then 
    you have to offer kafaarat yameen (expiation for breaking a vow), and that is not a divorce, as mentioned in the fatwa by Shaykh Ibn Baaz and 
    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on them). See Fataawa Islamiyyah, 3/280-285. 
Kafaarat yameen is mentioned in the verse in 
    which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allaah will not punish you for what is 
    unintentional in your oaths, but He will punish you for your deliberate oaths; for its expiation (a deliberate oath) feed ten Masaakeen (poor 
    persons), on a scale of the average of that with which you feed your own families, or clothe them or manumit a slave. But whosoever cannot afford 
    (that), then he should fast for three days. That is the expiation for the oaths when you have sworn”
[al-Maa'idah 5:89]
See also question no.
    9985. 
All of this is based on the assumption that 
    you spoke these words out loud, and that you were not just thinking of the matter. 
It is better and more on the safe side if you 
    offer kafaarat yameen. 
To sum up the answer: 
If you did not actually utter the words of 
    divorce, and you did not move your tongue, then you do not have to do anything. 
But if you uttered these words, even in a low 
    voice, this comes under the ruling of a vow (yameen), because you meant to stop her washing your clothes, not to divorce her. 
Whether your wife knows what happened or not, 
    that does not alter the ruling at all. 
The Muslim should avoid the matter of 
    divorce, whether in thinking, determining to do it or speaking the words out loud, because that exposes the Muslim family to destruction for 
    trivial reasons. 
We ask Allaah to set the Muslims’ affairs 
    straight.

34170,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34170,Is a Woman Married for 4 Things?,"I have read your Article No. 22 on (Rulings on Marriage ) I particularly did not understand the following phrase. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: (Women may be married for four things: wealth, beauty, lineage or religious commitment).
Does this mean the woman has to be wealthy, beautiful, come from a good ancestral family and be religiously committed? The final one on religious commitment is very clear to me and I too firmly believe in it; but the others aren’t. Please clarify.","There is nothing in this Hadith to suggest that it is enjoined or encouraged to marry a woman for her beauty, lineage or wealth. Rather what it means is that these are things that people look for in marriage. Some look for beauty, some look for lineage, some look for wealth, and some look for religious commitment – and this last is what the Prophet encouraged.",,"Praise be to Allah.This Hadith was narrated by Al-Bukhari (4802) and Muslim (1466) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who said: “A woman may be married for four things : her wealth, her lineage, her beauty and her religious commitment.

There is nothing in this Hadith to suggest that it is enjoined or encouraged to marry a woman for her beauty, lineage or wealth. Rather what it means is that these are things that people look for in marriage . Some look for a wife who is beautiful, some look for a wife who is descended from a noble family, some look for a wealthy wife, and some look for a wife who is religiously-committed – and this last is what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) encouraged when he said: “Seek the one who is religiously-committed, may your hands be rubbed with dust (i.e., may you prosper).” 
An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Muslim: 
“The correct view concerning the meaning of this Hadith is that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) spoke of what people usually do, for they seek these four characteristics, the last of which in their view is religious commitment, but you who are seeking to follow the right way should seek the one who is religiously committed.  This is not a command to do so… This Hadith encourages us to seek the company of religiously-committed people in all things, because the one who keeps company with them will benefit from their good attitude and good ways, and will be safe from any bad influence from them.” 
Al-Mubarakpuri (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Tuhfat Al-Ahwadhi: 
“Al-Qadi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is the people’s custom to seek certain characteristics in women and to choose a wife for a certain quality. It befits those who are religiously-committed to base their actions on religious guidance, especially with regard to matters that are serious and have lasting effects.”
The scholars differed greatly as to the meaning of the words, “May your hands be rubbed with dust.” An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Sahih Muslim: 
“The most correct view is that of the deeply-rooted and well-versed scholars, that this is a phrase which originally ‘May you become poor’, but the Arabs customarily used it in a sense other than its original meaning, so they would say things such as, ‘May your hands be rubbed in the dust,’ ‘May Allah kill him, how brave he is!’, ‘May he have no mother,’ ‘May you have no father,’ ‘May his mother be bereft of him,’ ‘Woe to his mother,’ and so on which they would say in the context of denouncing, rebuking, criticizing, expressing outrage encouraging an action, or expressing admiration, and so on.”

“Say: ‘O ‘Ibaadi (My slaves) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allaah, verily, Allaah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful’”
[al-Zumar 39:53]
This includes all sins, even shirk. Whoever repents, Allaah will accept his repentance. 
With regard repentance from shirk in particular and the acceptance thereof, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And those who invoke not any other ilaah (god) along with Allaah, nor kill such person as Allaah has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse and whoever does this shall receive the punishment.
69. The torment will be doubled to him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace;
70. Except those who repent and believe (in Islamic Monotheism), and do righteous deeds; for those, Allaah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allaah is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful”
[al-Furqaan 25:68-70] 
Allaah mentions the kufr and shirk of the Christians, then calls them to repent. He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Surely, disbelievers are those who said: “Allaah is the third of the three (in a Trinity).” But there is no Ilaah (god) (none who has the right to be worshipped) but One Ilaah (God —Allaah). And if they cease not from what they say, verily, a painful torment will befall on the disbelievers among them.
74. Will they not turn with repentance to Allaah and ask His forgiveness? For Allaah is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful”
[al-Maa'idah 5:73-74] 
No matter how great the sin, the forgiveness, generosity and kindness of Allaah is greater. 
All you have to do is to turn to Allaah, regret what you did and resolve not to do it again. Then receive the glad tidings of the bounty and mercy of Allaah, for Islam wipes out whatever sins came before it, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas (may Allaah be pleased with him): “O ‘Amr, do you not know that Islam wipes out whatever came before it.” Narrated by Muslim, 121; Ahmad, 17861. 
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The one who repents from sin is like one who did not sin.”  Narrated by al-Tirmidhi and classed as hasan by al-Albaani.  
If a person repents to Allaah, Allaah accepts his repentance and forgives him. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And He it is Who accepts repentance from His slaves, and forgives sins”
[al-Shoora 42:25] 
“And verily, I am indeed forgiving to him who repents, believes (in My Oneness, and associates none in worship with Me) and does righteous good deeds, and then remains constant in doing them (till his death)”
[Ta-Ha 20:82] 
We have to think well of our Lord and hope that He will accept our repentance, for Allaah says, “I am as My slave thinks I am.” A hadeeth qudsi narrated by al-Bukhaari, 7066; Muslim, 2675. According to Ahmad with a saheeh isnaad:  “I am as My slave thinks I am, so let him think whatever he wants.” 
With regard to strengthening your faith, this may be done in many ways, such as the following: 
1 – Remembering Allaah a great deal, reading His Book and sending a great deal of blessings upon His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
2 – Regularly offering the obligatory prayers on time and offering a lot of naafil prayers, so that one may attain the love and support of Allaah as it says in the hadeeth: “Whosoever shows enmity to someone devoted to Me, I shall be at war with him. My servant draws not near to Me with anything more loved by Me than the religious duties I have enjoined upon him, and My servant continues to draw nearto Me with supererogatory works so that I shall love him. When I love him I am hishearing with which he hears, his seeing with which he sees, his hand with which he strikes and his foot with which he walks. Were he to ask [something] of Me, Iwould surely give it to him, and were he to ask Me for refuge, I would surely granthim it.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6137. 
3 – Keeping company with good people who will help you to worship and obey Allaah and discourage you from disobeying Him.  
4 – Reading biographies of righteous people among the scholars, ascetics (zaahids), devoted worshippers and those who repented. 
5 – Keeping away from everything that reminds you of sin and calls you to it. 
In general, faith is increased by doing acts of worship and keeping away from haraam things. 
We ask Allaah to help you and to accept your repentance, and to guide your heart.

    and the Hereafter.’ He said, ‘Woe to you! Is your mother still alive?’  I said, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘Woe to you! Stay by her feet, for Paradise is 
    there.’” This hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan Ibn Maajah. 
Ibn Abi Shaybah narrated in his Musannaf 
    that Abu Talhah al-Asadi said: I was sitting with Ibn ‘Abbaas and two Bedouins came to him and spoke with him. One of them said: “I was looking 
    for a camel of mine and I stayed with some people. I liked a girl of theirs so I married her, and my parents swore that they would never accept 
    her. I swore that I would free a thousand slaves give one thousand gifts and slaughter one thousand camels if I divorced her.” Ibn ‘Abbaas said: 
    “I am not going to tell you to divorce your wife or to disobey your parents.” He said, “What should I do with this woman?” He said: “Honour your 
    parents.” 
Something similar was narrated from 
    Abu’l-Darda’. If this had to do with divorcing a woman after marrying her, it is more apt that you should obey your mother before marriage takes 
    place.

34183,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34183,Meeqaat for pilgrims from Australia,"We live in Australia, and this year a large group of Muslims from Australia intend to perform the obligation of Hajj. We will be travelling from Sydney, and our first stop will be one of three airports, Jeddah, Abu Dhabi or Bahrain. Where is the meeqaat from which we should enter ihraam? Should we enter ihraam from Sydney or from somewhere else? I hope you can answer us, thank you.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Neither Sydney, Abu Dhabi or Bahrain is a 
    meeqaat for Hajj or ‘Umrah, and Jeddah is not a meeqaat for people like you, rather it is a meeqaat for the people who live there. 
You have to enter ihraam when you fly over 
    the first meeqaat that you pass heading for Makkah, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, when defining the 
    meeqaats: “They are for them [their people] and for anyone who is not of their people who comes to them intending to perform Hajj and ‘Umrah.” You 
    could ask the air stewards before you pass over them, and if you have the intention of entering into ihraam for Hajj and ‘Umrah and you recite the 
    Talbiyah accordingly before you reach the meeqaat that you are going to pass over, lest you pass over it without entering ihraam, there is nothing 
    wrong with that. With regard to putting on the ihraam garments, cleansing oneself or doing ghusl, that may be done in any place. 
And Allaah is the Source of strength.","Standing Committee for Academic Research and Issuing Fatwas, 11/131"
34188,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34188,Etiquette of Hajj and ‘Umrah,I have read a description of Hajj and ‘Umrah on your website. Is there an etiquette which the pilgrim performing Hajj or ‘Umrah should observe?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The Hajj (pilgrimage) is (in) the well-known (lunar year) months (i.e. the 10th month, the 11th month and the first ten days of the 12th month of the Islamic calendar, i.e. two months and ten days). So whosoever intends to perform Hajj therein (by assuming Ihram), then he should not have sexual relations (with his wife), nor commit sin, nor dispute unjustly during the Hajj. And whatever good you do, (be sure) Allah knows it. And take a provision (with you) for the journey, but the best provision is At-Taqwa (piety, righteousness). So fear Me, O men of understanding!”
[al-Baqarah 2:197]
People should perform the rituals of Hajj with respect, veneration, love and submission to Allah the Lord of the Worlds, in a tranquil and dignified manner, following the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
These great rituals should be filled with dhikr (remembering Allah), takbeer (proclaiming Allah’s greatness by saying Allahu akbar), tasbeeh (glorifying Allah by saying Subhaan-Allah), tahmeed (praising Allah by saying al-hamdu Lillaah) and istighfaar (seeking Allah’s forgiveness by saying Astaghfir-Allah), because he is in a state of worship from the moment he enters ihram until he exits it; Hajj is not a time for idle talk and play or doing whatever you want with no restrictions, as we see some people do, so we see them playing and laughing and making fun of people and other reprehensible actions, as if Hajj were prescribed for joking and playing. 
The pilgrim and others should regularly observe the things that Allah has enjoined such as praying in congregation on time, and enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil. 
The pilgrim should strive to benefit the Muslims and treat them kindly by guiding them, helping them when needed, and being compassionate towards the weak, especially in places where such compassion is appropriate, such as in crowded places. Showing compassion to people brings mercy from the Creator, for Allah shows mercy to those of His slaves who are merciful. 
He should avoid obscenity, immorality, sin and arguing that does not support the truth. With regard to debating in support of the truth, this is obligatory when it is appropriate. He should avoid being aggressive towards people or annoying them, so he should avoid backbiting, malicious gossip, cursing, swearing, hitting, and looking at non-mahram women, for these things are haraam whether one is in ihram or not, but they are even more haraam when one is in ihram. 
He should avoid things that many people do, such as saying words that do not befit the rituals. For example, when stoning the jamaraat, some of them say, “We are stoning the Shaytaan” and they may curse the site or hit it with shoes etc., which is contrary to the idea of humility and worship, and defeats the purpose of stoning the jamaraat, which is to carry out the commands of Allah.
