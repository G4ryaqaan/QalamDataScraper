4419,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4419,"The funeral prayer was offered for the deceased
    once in America and again when he was brought to Pakistan","A muslim from our jamaah recently
      died and his family shipped the body back to pakistan, his janaza was prayed here in new
      york and again in pakistan. My question is which is the proper janaza.Jazakalla Khairan.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is correct to offer the Janaazah prayer for
    the deceased more than once. Both prayers are valid and it is hoped that the prayers will
    be an intercession for the deceased. Ibn Qudaamah said: “If a person catches up with
    the janaazah (funeral) but did not offer the prayer, he can still pray (Salaat
    al-Janaazah) for the deceased. This was done by ‘Ali and Anas, may Allaah be pleased
    with them, and by Sulaymaan ibn Rabee’ah, Abu Hamzah and Mu’ammar ibn Sameer.
    The prayer may be offered at the graveside, and it may be repeated before the burial
    either in congregation or individually. This was stated by Ahmad, who said: “There is
    nothing wrong with that. It was done by a number of the Companions of the Messenger of
    Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).” (al-Mughni,
    2/512)
    In a hadeeth, Ibn ‘Abbaas said: “The
    Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) reached a new grave, and they formed
    a row behind him, and he recited Takbeer (said “Allaahu akbar”) four
    times.” (Agreed upon. Al-Bukhaari, 1319, Muslim, 1586).
    Al-Sheeraazi said: “If someone comes who
    has not yet offered the (funeral) prayer for him, he should do so.” (al-Muhadhdhab
    , 1/134).
    Both the prayers are valid, because the prayer
    for the deceased may be offered more than once for a valid reason. Some of the scholars
    mentioned that it is permissible for a person who missed the funeral prayer to offer the
    prayer over him in his grave, up to a period of one month following his death. So those
    who offered the prayer for him in Pakistan did so because they had not prayed for him
    before that.
We must also point out that the Sunnah is to bury the
    deceased where he died, except in cases of necessity. So if there is a Muslim graveyard in
    the place where a person dies, he should be buried there. And Allaah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
4420,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4420,Boycotting someone who is not praying,"Respected Sheikh,my question is, a person's relative is not performing his/her prayers(Salah),therfore he/she has left the fold of Islaam.Is it permissable to greet them? Or should they be completely ignored",,,"Praise be to Allah.Not performing one’s prayers 
          is a dereliction of the most important duty among the pillars of Islam. 
          Prayer is the pillar and cornerstone of the faith, and it is not permissible 
          under any circumstances to be lenient towards the one who is not praying. 
          First of all his family should advise and enjoin him to pray, then they 
          should boycott him and turn away from him, and not greet him with salaam, 
          or eat with him or sit with him, in order to point out to him the seriousness 
          of sin, so that he will come back to Allaah and repent. The opinions 
          of the scholars with regard to the one who does not pray may be summed 
          up under the following two headings:  
         1.The opinion that the one who does not pray is a kaafir, which 
          is the opinion narrated from ‘Umar, ‘Ali and Ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah 
          be pleased with them). It was also the opinion of al-Hasan, al-Sha’bi, 
          al-Oozaa’i, Ibn al-Mubaarak and Muhammad ibn al-Hasan; it was also reported 
          from Ahmad, and is indicated by the hadeeth of the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “All that stands between 
          a person and kufr is his not praying.” (Reported by Muslim, Ahmad, Abu 
          Dawood and Ibn Maajah). 
2.The opinion that the one who does not pray is not a kaafir. This 
          is the opinion of Abu Haneefah, Maalik, and al-Shaafa'i, and is indicated 
          by the hadeeth of ‘Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit, who reported that the Prophet 
           (peace and blessings of Allaah 
          be upon him) said: “There are five prayers which Allaah has prescribed 
          for His slave during the day and night, whoever does them and does not 
          wilfully neglect them, Allaah will be bound to grant him admittance 
          to Paradise. Whoever does not do them will have no such guarantee; if 
          He wills, He will punish him and if He wills, He will grant him admittance 
          to Paradise.” (Reported by al-Daarimi, 1531; Maalik, al-Muwatta’, 
          248; Ahmad, 21690). 
 However, according to both opinions, 
          if a person insists on not praying, he should be asked three times to 
          repent, and if he refuses, then his fate will be execution.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
4426,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4426,A surgeon who has    left Christianity and is asking how he could pray whilst performing surgery if he becomes    Muslim,"I am currently a non-muslim but have been looking into the faith of Islam. I have a question concerning the five daily prayers as they would affect one's life. I understand that they are ment to be observed at very specific times of the day, and that this is compulsory. As a career, I have recently been leaning toward that of a surgeon. If one has a career such as this, which requires total concentration on the task at hand (where another's life is at stake), and which may take longer than the period of time between prayers, what does one do? It seems that in this sense the requirements of islam and the requirements of a rather noble profession are at odds. I'm wondering what a devout and knowledgeable muslim's thoughts are on the matter, and how these two lifestyles could be reconciled while still ""keeping the faith."" Thank you",,,"Praise be to Allah.Before we answer your question, we must express our appreciation for your interest in the religion of Islam and your efforts to find out the truth. You have left a false religion, Christianity, to look for the true religion, and this is a worthy attitude which indicates that you are not influenced by blind tradition and that you have freed yourself from the customs with which you were raised. Our Lord, may He be blessed and exalted, has criticized those who blindly follow falsehood, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): When it is said to them, Follow what Allah has sent down, they say, Nay! We shall follow what we found our fathers following. (Would they do that!) even though their fathers did not understand anything nor were they guided? [al-Baqarah 2:170].
Allaah described some Christian people who, when they found out about the religion of Islam and heard the Revelation that Allaah had sent to His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), followed the truth and submitted themselves to Him, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
And when they (who call themselves Christians) listen to what has been sent down to the Messenger, you see their eyes overflowing with tears because of the truth they have recognized. They say, Our Lord! We believe; so write us down among the witnesses.
And why should we not believe in Allah in that which has come to us of the truth? And we wish that our Lord will admit us (in Paradise on the Day of Resurrection) along with the righteous people. [al-Maidah 5:83-84]
We must also express our appreciation of your understanding of the importance of the five daily prayers and the necessity of praying them at the right times. We would like at this point to reaffirm an important truth in the Islamic religion, which is that the One Who revealed it and prescribed its rules and chose this religion for His slaves is Allaah, may He be exalted and glorified, from Whom nothing on earth or in heaven is hidden. He is the Knower of the Unseen, He knows what was, what is and what is yet to come. He knew before He created heaven and earth that there would come a time when mankind would develop the science of medicine and that there would be doctors who carry out lengthy operations such as open heart surgery, organ transplants such as liver transplants, operations to treat cancer of the oesophagus, complicated operations to treat injuries sustained in traffic accidents, and so on. For this reason, and because Islam is suitable for all times and places, there is no conflict between Islam and scientific progress or work-related duties. Before we give a detailed answer to your question, we would like to mention the following points:


Operations of this nature are usually carried out by a team of surgeons, where assistant surgeons work alongside the main surgeons so that they can take turns when necessary.


Some operations are carried out by several doctors who play different roles assigned to them according to their specialties. It is not always the case that one doctor will do a whole lengthy procedure by himself from beginning to end. So you will see that one makes the incision, another is a heart doctor, a third is specialized in operating on blood vessels, then the first one comes back to sew up the incision at the end. In some operations, the role of the specialist does not even take up half of the entire time spent on the surgery.


The kinds of operations that take a very long time, such as ten hours or more, are very rare indeed, few and far between.


With regard to how a surgeon can do his prayers, the detailed answer is as follows:


The basic principle is that every prayer should be offered at the right time, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): Verily, the prayer is enjoined on the believers at fixed hours. [al-Nisa 4:103]


If the operation is lengthy, the doctor can try to start after praying one of the prayers at the beginning of its appointed time, and try to finish before the end of the time for the following prayer, so that he offers each prayer within the allotted time.


He should try to arrange his schedule, as much as possible, in such a way that the time allotted for the surgery does not overlap the time for two prayers in a row. For example, he could start a lengthy procedure early in the morning, and continue until just before the time for Asr, so that he can pray Zuhr at the right time, and also give himself several hours to work uninterrupted. So, for example, if he begins an operation at 8.00 a.m. and finishes at 2.00 p.m., he will have six hours in which to work continuously, if he wishes.


If he can go to pray at the right time during an operation, and other members of the surgical team can do his work by taking turns, then they should do that. We wonder, if doctors need to go to the washroom during an operation, what do they do? If the surgical arrangements can take that possibility into account, and we know that some surgeons take a short rest or have a snack during the time of surgery, whilst another doctor takes over, then performing prayer is even more important than those things.


If the above is not possible, then there is nothing wrong with combining two prayers, such as joining Zuhr and Asr, and praying them at the later time, i.e., the time of Asr.


In very rare cases, when the surgery lasts for a very long time, and the time for two prayers has passed, such as when a surgeon starts before Zuhr and finishes after Maghrib, and he could not leave to do his prayers, then he should pray according to his circumstances. Indeed, he can even pray during the surgery, by starting his prayer with the words Allaahu akbar (Allaah is Most Great), reciting Quraan and tilting his head to indicate the rukoo (bowing) and sujood (prostration), as much as he can, tilting it lower for the sujood than the rukoo. This is how fighters on the front line pray when engaged in combat with the enemy during lengthy battles, or when pursuing the enemy or being pursued. He should pray according to his circumstances, and Allaah burdens not a person beyond his scope [al-Baqarah 2:286 interpretation of the meaning]. Praise be to Allaah Who does not make the religion too hard for us.


The evidence for these rulings is proven, and the sayings of the scholars regarding prayer in different circumstances is well-known and widely-disseminated in the books of Islamic fiqh (jurisprudence), which clearly indicates the flexibility of this blessed religion and its ability to deal with all the new developments in the human realm, ancient and modern. This is no wonder, for has it not been revealed by the All-Wise, Praiseworthy and All-Knowing?
Finally, we call on you to hasten to enter the religion of Islam, which guarantees happiness to the one who follows it in this world and the next, and offers answers to all problems. We are prepared to answer any questions you may have. Allaah is the Source of Strength and He is the Guide to the Straight Path.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

    wife can visit her family","Sir my question is that how many times can
      a wife go to her parents house in a week and what is the say of husband in this matter.
      Thank-you.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Upholding family ties is obligatory, as Allaah says
    (interpretation of the meaning):
“… fear Allaah through Whom you demand your mutual
    (rights), and (and do not cut of the relations of) the wombs (kinship)…”
    [al-Nisa’ 4:1]
“And give to the kindred his due and to the poor…”
    [al-Isra’ 17:26]
Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the
    Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
“Allaah created His creation, and when He had finished, al-rahm
    (the tie of kinship) got up. He said, ‘What is it?’ Al-rahm said: “This is
    the position of one who is seeking refuge with You from being cut off.’ He said,
    ‘Will you not be pleased if I should take care of the one who takes care of you, and
    cut off the one who cuts you off?’ Al-rahm said, ‘Of course, O Lord.’ He
    said, ‘Then it will be so.’” Abu Hurayrah quoted (interpretation of the
    meaning): “Would you then, if you were given the authority, do mischief in the
    land, and sever your ties of kinship?” [Muhammad 47:22]. (Reported by
    al-Bukhaari, 6948)
Upholding the ties of kinship means being kind to one’s relatives,
    whether by giving them material things or treating them well. The least of this is
    greeting them with salaam and not forsaking them.
There is no limit in sharee’ah to the number of times a person
    should visit his or her relatives, because this will differ according to people’s
    circumstances, how busy they are, how close or how far away they live, and the
    circumstances, employment and other commitments of the husband who is to bring his wife to
    visit her family. Some wives live close to their own families, and others may live in
    another city or country, all of which are factors in the matter. But the husband should
    realize that it is not permissible for him to deliberately prevent his wife from visiting
    her family and upholding her ties of kinship with them. By the same token, the wife should
    not exhaust her husband with frequent trips and expenses that he cannot bear. She should
    make requests of him commensurate with his capabilities. We ask Allaah to put all our
    affairs right. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

thank you",,,"Praise be to Allah.What is mentioned in the question is completely wrong. 
          The person who dies suddenly is just like anyone else who dies, for 
          whatever reason: his soul leaves his body, and the soul is a matter 
          of the unseen which is known only to Allaah. Some groups of innovators 
          (followers of bid’ah) believe that when a person dies, his soul moves 
          to another body. This is known as tanaasukh

4448,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4448,Speaking about    worldly matters in the mosque,"How should one behave, specially in a masjid, when the Adhan is being called? Are we allowed to talk worldly affairs while it is being called? Are we allowed to excange ""Salam"" (greetings) while it is being called?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Al-Haakim reported in al-Mustadrak (4/359) that Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: There will come a time when people will sit in circles in the mosques and they will have no concern except this world. Allah has no need of them so do not sit with them. This is a saheeh hadeeth even though al-Bukhaari and Muslim did not narrate it. Al-Dhahabi said in al-Talkhees that it is saheeh.
This hadeeth states that this blameworthy deed is disliked, because the mosques are not built for such a purpose. Allah commanded that mosques should be built to remember Him and to conduct prayers and acts of worship and obedience to Him, such as Itikaaf (retreat, seclusion for devotion and worship), and different kinds of dhikr such as circles for reciting Quran and seeking knowledge.
On the other hand, there are ahaadeeth that command us to repeat the words of the adhan after the muezzin, as a mustahabb or encouraged deed, and to set an example of how one should behave when hearing the adhan. Some people neglect this, and do not realize how much reward they are missing out on and how much they are to blame for that. What sort of hearts must they have?! They hear the remembrance of Allah then they turn away from Him, and it has no effect on their hearts so that they may fear Him and feel compelled to listen.
One of these ahaadeeth is that narrated by Imaam Muslim in his Saheeh (no. 384) from Amr ibn al-Aas (may Allah be pleased with him), who said that he heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: When any one of you hears the muezzin, let him say something like he says, then send blessings on me, for whoever sends blessings on me, Allah will send blessings tenfold on him. Then ask Allah to grant me al-waseelah, for it is a status in Paradise that only one of Allahs slaves will attain, and I hope that I will be the one. Whoever asks for al-waseelah for me, will be granted my intercession for him.
As for giving the greeting of salam and shaking hands, there is nothing wrong with this, for these are acts of obedience to Allah. There is no conflict between doing these things and responding to the muezzin, because a person may do all of these things at once.
Muslims should beware of doing anything that may offend or disturb those who come to the mosque for worship. This includes disturbing those who are reading Quran, praying or remembering Allah in the mosque. It is an evil deed (sayiah) to disturb the people in the mosque by talking about worldly affairs, because this is offensive to them and distracts Muslims from doing acts of worship properly. Disturbing others is not allowed, even if it takes the form of reading Quran, so how about if it takes other forms? Ahmad ibn Shuayb al-Nisaa'i reported in al-Sunan al-Kubra (5/32) under the heading Dhikr Qawl al-Nabi (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) Laa yajhar badukam ala badin fil-Quran (Mentioning the statement of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), None of you should compete with one another in reciting Quran loudly), a report from Abu Haazim al-Timaar from al-Bayaadi, that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came out and found the people praying and reciting in loud voices. He said: The one who is praying is conversing with his Lord, so let him think about what he is saying to Him. Do not compete with one another in reciting Quran loudly. Ibn Muhayreez (may Allah have mercy on him) is reported to have said: Speaking in the mosque is idle talk, except for one who is praying, or remembering his Lord, or asking for help or giving help. (Musannaf Abd al-Razzaaq, part 8, Baab Kalaam Ikrimah). Ibn al-Haaj said, concerning the manners of the Muslim when he sets out for the mosque: He should intend to avoid idle talk in the mosque or talking about that which does not concern him, for there is a report that says that speaking in the mosque about anything but the deeds of the Hereafter is like fire in dry wood, it eats up hasanaat (good deeds). So he should take care to avoid that, lest he goes out to engage in trade and comes back having lost everything because of his idle talk. (al-Madkhal by Ibn al-Haaj, part 1, al-Sunnah fil-Mashiy ilal-Masjid).
