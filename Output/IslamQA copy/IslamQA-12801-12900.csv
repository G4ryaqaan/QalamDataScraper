But if a person touches something impure, it is not permissible for him to pray until he has washed it off. 
Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: 
What is your opinion concerning a doctor whose work sometimes involves looking at the `awrah of the patient and touching it for the purpose of medical examination? Sometimes when doing surgery the doctor has to work in an environment that is filled with blood and urine. Is it obligatory to renew wudu in this situation or is it better to do so? 
He replied: 
“There is no sin in the (male) doctor touching a man’s `awrah in cases of necessity or touching it for the purpose of treatment , whether that is the `awrah at the front or the back. He may look at it or touch it in cases of necessity. Also it does not matter if he touches blood if he needs to during surgery, whether to remove it or to check on the state of the wound. But he should wash his hands afterwards to remove whatever has gotten onto them. Touching blood or urine does not invalidate wudu, but if he touches the awrah, whether at the front or the back, his wudu does become invalidated. But touching blood , urine or other impure substances does not invalidate wudu, rather he has to wash them off.” (Majmu’ Fatawa Ibn Baz, 6/20)

Islam started as something strange

Verses which encourage steadfastness in faith","Praise be to Allah.Understanding the essence of Islamic life
You have done well by realising that the Islamic life is the best life that a person could live. This is a great truth which few people understand, let alone become convinced of. Allah has stated that in more than one place in his Book. 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Whoever works righteousness — whether male or female — while he (or she) is a true believer (of Islamic Monotheism) verily, to him We will give a good life (in this world with respect, contentment and lawful provision), and We shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion to the best of what they used to do (i.e. Paradise in the Hereafter).” [An-Nahl 16:97]
And Allah has stated that whoever turns away from faith in Allah and remembrance of Him exposes himself to a life of hardship and misery , as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“But whosoever turns away from My Reminder (i.e. neither believes in this Quran nor acts on its teachings) verily, for him is a life of hardship, and We shall raise him up blind on the Day of Resurrection.”
He will say: ‘O my Lord! Why have you raised me up blind, while I had sight (before).’
 (Allah) will say: ‘Like this: Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) came unto you, but you disregarded them (i.e. you left them, did not think deeply in them, and you turned away from them), and so this Day, you will be neglected (in the Hell-fire, away from Allah’s Mercy).’
And thus do We requite him who transgresses beyond bounds [i.e. commits the great sins and disobeys his Lord (Allah) and believes not in His Messengers, and His revealed Books, like this Quran], and believes not in the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of his Lord; and the torment of the Hereafter is far more severe and more lasting.” [Ta-Ha 20:124-127]
Islamic life requires patience and forbearance
Once you have understood this, and it has become deeply rooted in your heart and you are at peace with it, then you will know that Allah has not created this universe, with the earth and the heavens, the seas and the rivers, the mountains and plains, the oases and the deserts, except for your sake, O poor, weak creature. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“He is Who created for you all that is on earth.” [Al-Baqarah 2:29]
Then you will realise that the great purpose for which you exist in this world is to worship your Lord and Creator, Who has created all things well: 
“And I (Allah) created not the jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone).” [Adh-Dhariyat 51:56 – interpretation of the meaning]
He has only created life and death in order to test His slaves in their performance of this duty of worship: 
“Who has created death and life that He may test you which of you is best in deed.  And He is the All-Mighty, the Oft-Forgiving” [Al-Mulk 67:2 – interpretation of the meaning]
Then Allah honoured His slaves and promised those who do good in this world that in the Hereafter theirs will be Paradise as vast as the heavens and the earth, in which is that which no eye has ever seen, no ear has ever heard, nor has it ever entered the mind of man. By the same token, He has warned those who do evil and neglect His rights over them that theirs will be a blazing Fire, in which they will neither live nor die, in which He has created all kinds of punishments and torments, hearing of which would turn a child’s hair white, let alone seeing them and suffering them. We ask Allah to keep us and you safe from that… amen. 
Once you know this with certainty, then you will know that succeeding in this test is a serious matter which can only be achieved with a measure of effort and hardship which requires patience and forbearance . But this is hardship which passes swiftly and difficulty which soon comes to an end, because it is followed by eternal rest and happiness. So what is an hour of hardship and a moment of pain when compared to that eternal delight. We ask Allah to bless us and you with His grace and Paradise…amen. 
Islam started as something strange 
You should also note – may Allah guide you – that the more religious commitment becomes something strange and the fewer people there are who truly adhere to it – as is the situation nowadays – the more difficult it becomes to remain steadfast. It is hard to be different from the vast majority of people. Hence Allah in His wisdom increases the reward of the sincere believers who remain steadfast in adhering to the truth, those who give precedence to pleasing Him over everything else and sacrifice that which is most precious to them for the sake of achieving that. Muslim (145) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Islam started as something strange and will go back to being something strange as it began. So glad tidings to the strangers.” 
In Sunan At-Tirmidhi (3058), it is narrated from Abu Tha`labah Al-Khushani (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “After you there will come days during which being patient will be like holding on to a live coal. The one who strives during those days will have a reward like that of fifty men who strive as you do.” According to another report: It was said: “O Messenger of Allah, the reward of fifty men like them or like us?” He said: “No, the reward of fifty men like you.” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Targhib wat Tarhib, 3172) 
These Hadiths and others indicate that at the end of time, there will be many evil and corrupt people, and few who are good and righteous and fear Allah. That is because there will be so much Fitnah (temptation and tribulation) and because sin and temptation will be so widespread that adhering to Islam will become something strange and may even become something strange among the Muslims themselves. 
These Hadiths also indicate that adherence to Islam is not something easy, rather it is like holding on to a live coal. What will help a person to do that, after guidance from Allah, is being patient in adhering to this path until he meets his Lord not being negligent or heedless, so he will meet a Lord Who is pleased with him and not angry with him, and will give him a great and much-multiplied reward. If a person truly understands this, he will regard as insignificant whatever he encounters for the sake of that which is waiting for him with his Lord, by the will and grace of Allah. 
What we have said applies if you feel that things are too difficult for you and you fear that your patience is weak and that you are slipping and not remaining steadfast. 
Beware of letting despair enter your heart
However, if you are feeling that you have no hope of spreading this Islamic life that you live among those who are around you, and bringing them back to Islam as you are obliged to do, because of the opposition and resistance that you encounter, you should know that every step that you take in that direction is a victory and an act of charity. A good word is a charity, and you do not know when a word that you have spoken may take effect in the heart of the one who hears it and be of some benefit to him, even if that is after some time. So you should not give up hope that it will do some good one day. 
“And when a community among them said: “Why do you preach to a people whom Allah is about to destroy or to punish with a severe torment?” (The preachers) said: “In order to be free from guilt before your Lord (Allah), and perhaps they may fear Allah.” [Al-A`raf 7:164 - interpretation of the meaning]
Beware of letting despair enter your heart. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Certainly no one despairs of Allah’s Mercy, except the people who disbelieve.” [Yusuf 12:87]
Beware of despair for it is misguidance: 
“And who despairs of the Mercy of his Lord except those who are astray?” [Al-Hijr 15:56 - interpretation of the meaning]
Remember that your efforts will never be lost, so long as you remain on the right path. The point where your life ends, this is your destination: 
“He who emigrates (from his home) in the Cause of Allah, will find on earth many dwelling places and plenty to live by. And whosoever leaves his home as an emigrant unto Allah and His Messenger, and death overtakes him, his reward is then surely, incumbent upon Allah. And Allah is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [An-Nisa’ 4:100 - interpretation of the meaning]
Then will come the turn of those who come after you, to take the flag from you and continue the rest of the journey. How many of this Ummah are still left: “Allah will continue to plant new people in this religion and use them in His obedience.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah and classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sunan Ibn Majah, 1/5) 
Be certain of the promise of Allah to this Ummah of support and help 
“And indeed We have written in Az-Zaboor [i.e. all the revealed Holy Books the Tawrat (Torah), the Injil (Gospel), the Psalms, the Quran] after (We have already written in) Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuth (the Book that is in the heaven with Allah) that My righteous slaves shall inherit the land (i.e. the land of Paradise).” [Al-Anbiya’ 21:105 - interpretation of the meaning]
“This matter (i.e., Islam) will reach as far as the day and night reach, and Allah will not leave any house of mud or hair but He will bring this religion into it … and Allah will bring glory to Islam and humiliation to kufr.” (Narrated by Ahmad and classed as authentic by Al-Albani in As-Silsilah As-Sahihah, 32) 
I urge you to remain steadfast in your religious commitment and not to turn away from it despite the many trials and temptations and the many obstacles. Remember that the good end will be for those who fear Allah (the pious). 
You should strive to find all means that will help you to remain steadfast in adhering to the religion of Allah. On this website you will find an essay which describes ways and means of remaining steadfast in Islam. I advise you to read it and study it. 
Verses which encourage steadfastness in faith
In conclusion, I would like to leave you with these great verses from the Book of Allah which He revealed to His slave Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to be a healing for the believers’ hearts and a remedy for their ills. Read them and ponder them, and if you can look up the commentary on them in one of the books of Tafsir such as the Tafsir of Shaykh `Abd Ar-Rahman ibn Sa`di or Tafsir Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) then that will be good. 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Or do you think that you will enter Paradise without such (trials) as came to those who passed away before you? They were afflicted with severe poverty and ailments and were so shaken that even the Messenger and those who believed along with him said, ‘When (will come) the Help of Allah?’ Yes! Certainly, the Help of Allah is near!” [Al-Baqarah 2:214]
“Alif-Lam-Mim.
[These letters are one of the miracles of the Quran, and none but Allah (Alone) knows their meanings.]
Do people think that they will be left alone because they say: “We believe,” and will not be tested.
And We indeed tested those who were before them. And Allah will certainly make (it) known (the truth of) those who are true, and will certainly make (it) known (the falsehood of) those who are liars, (although Allah knows all that before putting them to test)” [Al-`Ankabut 29:1-3]
“And for those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah and the other articles of Faith) and do righteous good deeds, surely, We shall make them enter with (in the entrance of) the righteous (in Paradise).
Of mankind are some who say: ‘We believe in Allah.’ But if they are made to suffer for the sake of Allah, they consider the trial of mankind as Allah’s punishment; and if victory comes from your Lord, (the hypocrites) will say: ‘Verily, we were with you (helping you).’ Is not Allah Best Aware of what is in the breasts of the ‘Alamin (mankind and jinn).” [Al-`Ankabut 29:9-10] 
“And among mankind is he who worships Allah as it were upon the edge (i.e. in doubt): if good befalls him, he is content therewith; but if a trial befalls him he turns back on his face (i.e. reverts to disbelief after embracing Islam). He loses both this world and the Hereafter. That is the evident loss.” [Al-Hajj 22:11] 
“Verily, those who say: ‘Our Lord is Allah (Alone),’ and then they stand firm, on them the angels will descend (at the time of their death) (saying): ‘Fear not, nor grieve! But receive the glad tidings of Paradise which you have been promised!’” [Fussilat 41:30] 
“Verily, those who say: ‘Our Lord is (only) Allah,’ and thereafter stand firm (on the Islamic Faith of Monotheism), on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.
Such shall be the dwellers of Paradise, abiding therein (forever) a reward for what they used to do.” [Al-Ahqaf 46:13-14]
And there are other verses which encourage us to remain steadfast in our religious commitment and describe what Allah has promised to the sincere believers. The Book of Allah is filled with verses which state this and explain it in the most eloquent manner. So I advise you to read and ponder the Quran. By Allah’s Leave you will find in it the best help in remaining patient and not despairing or finding the way too long. For this world will quickly come to an end, then each person will find that which he has sent on ahead with his Lord; it is good, all well and good, but if it is bad then the outcome will be bad: 
“On the Day when every person will be confronted with all the good he has done, and all the evil he has done, he will wish that there were a great distance between him and his evil. And Allah warns you against Himself (His punishment) and Allah is full of kindness to (His) slaves.” [Al `Imran 3:30]
I ask Allah to open your heart to goodness and to make you steadfast in adhering to the truth until You meet Him. May he divert all evil away from you, for He is All-Hearing, Ever Near. And Allah knows best. 
May Allah send blessings and peace upon His slave and Prophet Muhammad and upon his family and companions.

12806,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12806,Ruling on the view that we should seek to acquire the characteristics of Allaah,"One of the khateebs said in his Friday khutbah that we have to strive to acquire the attributes and characteristics of Allaah. Is there a correct way of interpreting this sentence, and is there anyone who has said this before?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.This sentence is not appropriate, but there 
    is a correct way of interpreting it, which is that we are encouraged to strive to acquire the characteristics implied by the attributes and names 
    of Allaah. That means looking at the attributes which it is befitting for a created being to acquire the characteristics implied by them, unlike 
    the attributes which belong only to Allaah, such as His being the Creator, the Provider, the One God, etc.  These are characteristics which a 
    created being cannot acquire, and it is not permissible for him to lay claim to them or similar names. Rather what is referred to is the 
    attributes which Allaah likes for His slaves to acquire the characteristics implied thereby, such as knowledge, strength, mercy, forbearance, 
    generosity and forgiveness, etc. So Allaah is All-Knowing and loves those who are knowledgeable; He is Strong and He loves the strong believer 
    more than He loves the weak believer; He is Generous and loves those who are generous; He is Merciful and He loves those who show mercy; He is 
    Forgiving and loves forgiveness, etc. But when applied to Allaah, these attributes are more perfect and greater than when applied to any created 
    being, because there is nothing like unto Allaah in His attributes and actions, just as there is nothing like unto Allaah in His Essence. Rather 
    it is sufficient for a person to have a share in the sense of these attributes, in a manner that suits him and within the limits set by sharee’ah. 
    If his generosity oversteps the mark, then he becomes a spendthrift; if his mercy oversteps the mark, then he will not carry out the punishments 
    dictated by sharee’ah; if his forgiveness transgresses the limits set by sharee’ah, then it is inappropriate. This was stated by the great scholar 
    Ibn al-Qayyim in his books ‘Uddat al-Saabireen and al-Waabil al-Sayyib, and in other books such as al-Madaarij and Zaad 
    al-Ma’aad. There follows what he said in al-‘Uddah and al-Waabil: 
In al-‘Uddah (p. 310) he said: 
    “Because Allaah is indeed the Appreciative (al-Shukoor), the most beloved of His creation to Him are those who have the characteristic of 
    gratitude (al-shukr), just as the most hated of His creation to Him are those who are lacking in this characteristic or who have the 
    opposite characteristic. This applies to His Beautiful names: the most beloved of His creation to Him are those who have the characteristics 
    implied by His names, and the most hated of His creation to Him are those who have the opposite characteristics. Hence He hates those who are 
    ungrateful, those who do wrong, those who are ignorant, hard-hearted, miserly, cowardly and ignoble. He is Beautiful and loves beauty; He is 
    All-Knowing and loves those who have knowledge; He is Merciful and loves those who show mercy; He does good and loves those who do good; He is the 
    Concealer and loves those who conceal; He is Powerful and condemns those who act helpless, and the strong believer is more beloved to Him than the 
    weak believer; He is forgiving and loves forgiveness; He is One and He loves that which is odd-numbered; everything that He loves is connected to 
    His names and attributes; and everything that He hates is the opposite of that.” 
He said in al-Waabil (p. 543 of 
    Majmoo’at al-Hadeeth): “Generosity is one of the attributes of the Lord, for He gives and does not take, He feeds and is not fed, He is the 
    most generous of those who are generous. The most beloved of His creation to Him are those who seek to acquire the characteristics implied by His 
    attributes. For He is Generous and loves those among His slaves who are generous; He is All-Knowing and loves those who have knowledge; He is 
    All-Powerful and loves those who are courageous; He is Beautiful and loves beauty.” 
I hope that what we have mentioned will be 
    sufficient and will serve the intended purpose. I ask Allaah to help us all to understand His religion and to fulfil our duty towards Him, for He 
    is All-Hearing, Ever Near.","Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah, 6/251"
12808,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12808,There are no trivial issues in Islam,"What is the ruling on those who say that shaving the beard and making one's garment shorter are trivial matters and are not basic principles of religion, or those who laugh at those who do these things?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.This suggestion is serious and is a grievous 
    mistake. There are no trivial issues in Islam, rather all of it is serious and is aimed at guiding man to the best way. It is divided into basics 
    and minor issues, and the issues of the beard and shortening the garment come under the minor issues, not basic issues. But it is not permissible 
    to call any of the issues of religion insignificant. There is the fear that the person who says such a thing by way of belittling or mocking may 
    be apostatizing from his religion thereby, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“If you ask them (about this), they declare: ‘We were only talking idly and joking.’ Say: ‘Was 
    it at Allaah, and His Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) and His Messenger that you were mocking?’
Make no excuse; you disbelieved after you 
    had believed”
[al-Tawbah 9:65-66]
The Messenger peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) is the one who enjoined letting the beard grow and trimming the moustache; it is essential to obey him and to heed his 
    commands and prohibitions in all matters. 
Abu Muhammad ibn Hazm narrated that there was 
    scholarly consensus that letting the beard grow and trimming the moustache is something obligatory, and undoubtedly happiness, salvation, pride, 
    honour and good consequences lie in obeying Allaah and His Messenger, and doom, loss and bad consequences lie in disobeying Allaah and His 
    Messenger. Similarly, wearing one’s clothes above the ankles is obligatory because of the words of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him): “Whatever part of the lower garment hangs below the ankles is in the Fire.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari in his Saheeh). And he 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There are three to whom Allaah will not speak on the Day of Resurrection, nor even look at 
    them or praise them, and theirs will be a painful torment: the one who lets his lower garment hang below his ankles; the one who reminds others of 
    things he has given to them; and the one who sells his product by means of false oaths.” (Narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh). And he  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah will not look at the one who lets his garment drag out of pride.” (Agree upon). 
So the Muslim man must fear Allaah by 
    shortening his garment above the ankles, whether it is a galabiyah, an izaar (lower garment, waist-wrapper), pants or abayah (cloak), and not 
    letting it come down below his ankles. It is better if it comes to mid-calf length. If the isbaal (letting the garment hang below the ankles) is 
    done because of pride or arrogance, the sin is more serious;  if it is because of carelessness and not because of pride, it is still an evil 
    action and the one who does it is a sinner according to the more correct of the two scholarly views, but his sin is less serious than the sin of 
    one who does it out of pride. Undoubtedly isbaal is a means that leads to arrogance even if the one who does claims that he is not doing it out of 
    pride, because the warning in the ahaadeeth is general, so it is not permissible to take this matter lightly. 
With regard to the story of al-Siddeeq (Abu 
    Bakr), when he said to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “My izaar (lower garment) slips down unless I pay attention 
    to it”, and the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to him, “You are not one of those who do it out of arrogance,” this 
    applies to those whose case is like that of Abu Bakr with regard to their garment slipping down by mistake, not because of arrogance, but they 
    still try not to let that happen. As for those who let their garment drag deliberately, this warning applies to them but not to people like Abu 
    Bakr. 
As well as the warning mentioned above, 
    isbaal (letting the garment hang below the ankle) is also a kind of extravagance and exposes the garment to dirt and impurities, and it is an 
    imitation of women. All of that dictates that the Muslim should protect himself from that. And Allaah is the Source of strength and the Guide to 
    the straight path.","Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah li’l-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 6/323"

She was always having arguments with her husband, and she also had a disagreement with her father. The reason was that her husband treated her very harshly, which made her leave the house and go to the house of her mother, who was divorced and was married to someone else. Her mother’s husband also treated her badly. I – her brother – went and got her an apartment where she could live with me, but she often used to go to her mother. One time her mother’s husband forced her to go and leave her children with her husband, and she did that just to please her mother. One day there was an argument between her and her mother’s husband, and she went to her apartment, very upset about the calamities that had befallen her and the fact that her children had been taken away. She went and took some pills from the fridge and swallowed them all in an attempt to end her life. I took her to the hospital and had her treated. Before she died, she realized that she was about to die and she repented and started to pray a great deal for forgiveness for what she had done. She asked us to pray for forgiveness for her. Allaah willed that she should pass away. What is her situation now? Is it permissible for me to give charity and perform Hajj on her behalf? Please note that I vowed to do these actions all my life in sha Allah.",,,"Praise be to Allah.So long as your sister repented to Allaah for 
    what she did of trying to commit suicide, there is the hope that she may be forgiven. Repentance wipes out what came before it, and the one who 
    repents from sin is like one who did not sin at all, as was narrated in saheeh ahaadeeth from the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him). If you give in charity on her behalf or pray for forgiveness for her or make du’aa’ for her, that is good; it will benefit her and you 
    will be rewarded for it. You have to fulfil the vows you made to do those acts of worship, because Allaah has praised those who fulfil their vows 
    in the verse in which He praises the righteous:

          the Verses (the Qur’aan) of Allaah that the Zaalimoon (polytheists and 
          wrongdoers) deny” [al-An’aam 6:33 – interpretation of the meaning]. 
          This happens very often. Hence the scholars divided kufr into various

          and pride; the kufr of disbelief; the kufr of hypocrisy; the kufr of 
          doubt. There is a great deal of evidence to that effect in the Book 
          of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). The story of Abu Taalib 
          and the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
          of Allaah be upon him) is clear; he believed in him and he used to say, 
          “Our son does not tell lies,” but he was still a kaafir, because he 
          never made a statement of faith or followed it up with actions.",Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah al-Ghunaymaan

          the Messenger  (peace and 
          blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever among you sees an evil 
          action, let him change it with his hand [by taking action]; if he cannot, 
          then with his tongue [by speaking out]; and if he cannot, then with 
          his heart [by hating it and feeling that it is wrong]…” This is general 
          and applies both to the one who is seeking to remove the evil and the 
          one who is being denounced; it does not apply to one and not to the 
          other. But it is essential to pay attention to circumstances: if seeking 
          to remove an evil will lead to an even greater evil, then it is not 
          permissible under any circumstances to denounce the one who is doing 
          it, whether he is a ruler or a subject. But if it is known that the 
          evil will be reduced and good will result from that if it is denounced, 
          then it must be done regardless of whether the one who is being denounced 
          is a ruler or otherwise, because this is what is implied by the hadeeth of the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). But it is not permissible to limit the meaning of the words of Allaah or the words of His Messenger

          ruqam in two ways:   
          
(i)That it refers to images in carpets and similar items, which 
          are walked on and are not treated in a respectful manner like pillows. 
          This is allowed, because the Messenger  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) allowed it. What is meant 
          is that he allowed their use, but making images is not allowed. 
(ii)That it refers to decorations on garments, apart from pictures 
          or images. Decoration on clothing is fine and does not come under the 
          ruling on images. What is forbidden is images of animate beings, human 
          or otherwise, because it was reported that the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) entered upon ‘Aa’ishah and 
          saw a garment on which there was an image. He got angry and tore it 
          down, and said, “The makers of these images will be punished on the 
          Day of Resurrection, and they will be told, ‘Give life to that which 
          you have created.’ ‘Aa’ishah said: So I made it into two pillows on

          the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
          of Allaah be upon him) had an appointment with Jibreel, and he was late, 
          so he went out to him and found him waiting for him (outside). Jibreel 
          said to him: “In the house there is a statue, and a curtain with images 
          on it, and a dog. Go and break the head off the statue so that it will 
          look like a tree, and go and make two pillows out of the curtain that 
          will be thrown on the floor and stepped on, and go and throw the dog 
          out.” The Prophet  (peace and blessings 
          of Allaah be upon him) went and did that, then Jibreel (peace be upon

Is this correct?",,,"Praise be to Allah.This is not necessarily the case, but it could happen. Some people are tested by means of someone else putting a magic spell on them which prevents them from having intercourse with their wives. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):

But if a person uses the prayers for refuge prescribed in Islam, Allaah will be sufficient for him against the evil of the magicians and others, and Allaah will take that (magic) away if it is present. So he has to read Aayat al-Kursi over himself, and al-Faatihah, and the verses which speak of sihr (magic), and “Qul Huwa Allaahu Ahad” and the Mi’wadhatayn, and it will go away by Allaah’s Leave.

    The religion of Islam is the true religion which was brought 
    by the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
    It includes the most perfect laws, as Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “This day, I have perfected your religion for you, 
    completed My Favour upon you”

    [al-Maa'idah 5:3]
The sharee’ah (law) of 
    the Qur’aan is a perfect, comprehensive and eternal law, containing all the 
    rulings which bring happiness to people in this life and in the Hereafter. 
    That includes rulings on matters of finance, the rulings which regulate and 
    list the means of earning and spending money. It is not permissible to earn 
    money in every way or to dispose of money in whatever way a person desires. 
    In all these matters, one has to submit to the laws of Allaah, which include 
    the prohibition on interest. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allaah has permitted 
    trading and forbidden Riba” [al-Baqarah 2:275] 
“O you who believe! Be 
    afraid of Allaah and give up what remains (due to you) from Riba” [al-Baqarah 
    2:278]
Some of the obvious forms 
    of riba include taking and giving interest on loans. Loans with interest are 
    not permissible, and what is called interest in the language of the banks is 
    riba in the language of sharee’ah. The “goodly loan” (al-qard al-hasanah), 
    on the other hand, is the loan by means of which one intends to show 
    kindness to another and do him a favour, which does not involve taking 
    interest. What the banks call loans are in fact contracts of riba. Allaah is 
    Wise in His rulings because He has prescribed that which is in man’s 
    interests in this life and in the Hereafter, and He is the All-Wise,

    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Men are the protectors 
    and maintainers of women, because Allaah has made one of them to excel the 
    other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:34]

    This aayah states that the man is the guardian of the woman 
    and is in charge of her. According to a saheeh hadeeth, the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The man is the shepherd 
    of the members of his household and is responsible for his flock. Each of 
    you is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock. So the man is a shepherd 
    and is responsible for his flock.” The most important duty of the “shepherd” 
    is to guide his “flock” to obey the commands of Allaah by doing that which 
    Allaah has enjoined and abstaining from that which He has forbidden. In this 
    way he will be fulfilling his duty of enjoining what is good and forbidding 
    what is evil. So the husband has to tell his wife to do that which Allaah 
    has enjoined upon her and he must forbid her to do that which Allaah has 
    prohibited. The greatest duties that the Muslim must fulfil are the five 
    daily prayers and fasting Ramadaan. These are two of the pillars of Islam. 
    The husband must tell his wife to do these things and to observe these two 
    pillars regularly. It is not permissible for him to be careless in this 
    matter. The same applies to all other obligatory duties. He must also forbid 
    her to do that which Allaah has forbidden, whether it is words or deeds. If 
    he sees that she is responding and obeying, then that is what is required. 
    But if she persists in disobeying then the Muslim man should not stay with 
    her, rather he has to divorce her. How can a Muslim be pleased with a wife 
    who does not pray or who misses some of the prayers, or does not fast in 
    Ramadaan? This is something that is not befitting for a Muslim. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The believers, men and 
    women, are Awliyaa’ (helpers, supporters, friends, protectors) of one 
    another; they enjoin (on the people) Al‑Ma‘roof (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and 
    all that Islam orders one to do), and forbid (people) from Al‑Munkar (i.e. 
    polytheism and disbelief of all kinds, and all that Islam has forbidden); 
    they perform As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as-Salaah), and give the Zakaah, and obey 
    Allaah and His Messenger. Allaah will have His Mercy on them. Surely, Allaah 
    is All-Mighty, All-Wise”[al-Tawbah 9:71]
Whoever does his duty 
    of enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil has freed himself from 
    blame and is safe from the punishment of Allaah. But whoever is careless and 
    negligent is exposing himself to the threat which Allaah has issued to those 
    who neglect this duty. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Those among the Children 
    of Israel who disbelieved were cursed by the tongue of Dawood (David) and 
    ‘Eesa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary). That was because they disobeyed (Allaah 
    and the Messengers) and were ever transgressing beyond bounds.
79. They used not to 
    forbid one another from Al-Munkar (wrong, evildoing, sins, polytheism, 
    disbelief) which they committed. Vile indeed was what they used to do”
[al-Maa'idah 5:78-79] 
“O you who believe! Take 
    care of your ownselves. If you follow the (right) guidance [and enjoin what 
    is right (Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do) and forbid 
    what is wrong (polytheism, disbelief and all that Islam has forbidden)] no 
    hurt can come to you from those who are in error”[al-Maa'idah 5:105]

12833,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12833,Is it prescribed in Islam to give a speech or exhortation at the graveside?,Is it prescribed in Islam to give a speech or exhortation at the graveside? We have heard some people say that this was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and some who say that it is Sunnah.,,,"Praise be to Allah.The view that nothing of the sort was narrated at all  is not correct, and the view that it is Sunnah is also not correct. 
There is no report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to stand at the graveside or in the graveyard when the janaazah (body prepared for burial) was brought then exhort the people and remind them as if he were delivering a khutbah on Friday. This is what we have heard of people doing, but this is bid’ah and may lead in the future to things that are more serious. It may lead to the speaker referring of the deceased person who has been brought. For example, if the deceased was an evildoer, the speaker may say, “Look at this man, yesterday he used to play, yesterday he used to mock, yesterday he used to do such and such, but now he is in his grave and being brought to account.” Or he may say concerning a businessman: “Look at So and so, yesterday he was enjoying palaces and cars and servants and so on, and now he is in his grave.”
We think that there should not be a preacher delivering a khutbah at the graveside, because this is not Sunnah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not stand after burying the deceased, or when waiting to bury the deceased, and address the people, and we have not heard of anyone doing this among those who came before us, who were closer to the Sunnah than us. Neither have we heard of this from the khulafa’ who came before them. The people at the time of Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, ‘Uthmaan and ‘Ali did not do this, as far as we know, and the best of guidance is the guidance of those who came before, if it is in accordance with the truth. With regard to the exhortation that is like regular talk in a gathering, there is nothing wrong with that, because it is narrated in al-Sunan that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) went out to Baqee’ al-Gharqad (the graveyard of Madeenah) where some people were burying one of their number who had died. The deceased had not yet been placed in the lahd (niche in the side of the grave) and they were still digging his grave. He sat down and his companions sat around him, and he started telling them about what happens to a person when he is dying and after he has been buried. He spoke to them in a quiet manner, not in the manner of a khutbah. 
It is also narrated in Saheeh al-Bukhaari and elsewhere that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no one among you for whom his place in Paradise or in Hell has not been decreed.” They said: “O Messenger of Allaah, shall we not rely on that?” He said: “No; strive hard, for each person will be enabled to do that for which he was created.” 
The point is that the kind of exhortation where a man stands and delivers a speech at the burial or afterwards is not Sunnah and is not appropriate for the reasons I have mentioned. As for exhortation that does not take the form of a khutbah or speech, such as when a man sits and his companions sit with him, and he says a few words appropriate to the occasion, this is good and is following the example of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)","Liqaa’aat al-Baab il-Maftooh by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 2/55-56"

I feel very trubled about it and seek Allah guidance abd forgiveness.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
We ask 
    Allaah to help you to do good, and to make things easy for you and relieve 
    you of your distress. For what a Muslim woman hears and sees of those who 
    have turned away from the religion of Allaah or whose commitment has become 
    very weak, she has to bear that with patience and seek reward for things 
    that she suffers. She had to have hope in her Lord and ask Him to help her 
    to remain steadfast. 
It is not 
    permissible for her to respond to their demands or to go along with their 
    whims and desires for her to mix with them, look at them, shake hands with 
    them and give up hijaab, because if she pleases them in this manner she will 
    incur the wrath of her Lord. 
Secondly: 
The sons of 
    your husband’s brothers and sisters are not mahrams, rather they are among 
    the people of whom you should be extra cautious, because the Prophet SAWS 
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) likened them to death. 
It was 
    narrated from ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Aamir that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Beware of entering upon women.” A 
    man from among the Ansaar said, “O Messenger of Allaah, what about the 
    in-law?” He said, “The in-law is death.” 
(Narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari, 4934; Muslim, 2172) 
Al-Nawawi 
    said: The scholars of Arabic language are agreed that al-hamu 
    (translated here as “in-law”) refers to the relatives of a woman’s husband, 
    such as his father, paternal uncle, brother, brother’s son (nephew), cousin 
    (son of paternal uncle), etc. Akhtaan (sing. khatan) refers to 
    the relatives of a man’s wife, and ashaar (sing. suhr) refers 
    to both.
 With regard 
    to the Prophet’s words “The in-law is death,” what this means is that there 
    is more fear with regard to him than anyone else, and evil is to be expected 
    of him, and the fitnah (temptation) is greater because he is able to reach 
    the woman and be alone with her without anyone denouncing that, unlike the 
    case of one who is a stranger. What is meant by “in-law” (hamu) here 
    is the relatives of the husband apart from his father/grandfather and 
    sons/grandsons. Fathers/grandfathers and sons/grandsons are mahrams for his 
    wife and it is permissible for them to be alone with her. The word “death” 
    here does not refer to them. Rather what is meant is the brother, brother’s 
    son, paternal uncle, cousin, etc, who are not mahrams. People are usually 
    careless about this matter and a man may let his wife be alone with his 
    brother. This is what is referred to by “death” and should be prevented more 
    than her being alone with a stranger for the reasons mentioned above. What 
    we have mentioned is the correct meaning of the hadeeth. 
Sharh 
    Muslim, 14/154 
Shaykh ‘Abd 
    al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
It is 
    permissible for a woman to sit with her husband’s brothers or cousins, etc., 
    if she is wearing complete shar’i hijaab, which means covering her face, 
    hair and entire body, because she is ‘awrah and fitnah. That is if there is 
    nothing dubious about the gathering. But if the gathering is one in which 
    there is something dubious, then it is not permitted, such as sitting with 
    them in order to listen to singing and musical instruments, etc.; and it is 
    not permissible for her to be alone with any one of them or with anyone else 
    who is not a mahram for her, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) said: “No man should be alone with a (non-mahram) 
    woman unless she has a mahram with her.” (Saheeh; agreed upon). And he  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No man should be alone 
    with a (non-mahram) woman, for the third one present will be the Shaytaan.” 
    (Narrated by Imam Ahmad with a saheeh isnaad from ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab. May 
    Allaah be pleased with him). 
And Allaah 
    is the Source of strength. 
Fataawa 
    al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah, 1/422, 423 
Thirdly: 
As for a woman shaking 
    hands with a non-mahram man, this is haraam. It is not permitted for you to 
    take this matter lightly just because your relatives or your husband’s 
    relatives want you to. 
It was 
    narrated from ‘Urwah that ‘Aa’ishah told him about the bay’ah (oath of 
    allegiance) given by the women: “The hand of the Messenger of Allaah  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) never touched the hand of any 
    woman. When he accepted the oath of allegiance from a woman, he would accept 
    her words and then say, ‘Go, for you have sworn your allegiance.’” 
    
(Narrated by 
    Muslim, 1866) 
So this 
    infallible one, the best of all mankind, the leader of the sons of Adam on 
    the Day of Resurrection, did not touch women, even though the bay’ah or oath 
    of allegiance originally was done by giving one's hand. So the ruling should 
    be even more strict with regard to other men?  
It was narrated that 
    Umaymah the daughter of Raqeeqah said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “I do not shake hands with 
    women.”

    al-Nasaa’i, 4181; Ibn Maajah, 2874; classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani 
    in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 2513) 
Shaykh Ibn 
    Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
Shaking 
    hands with women with a barrier in between is something that is subject to 
    further debate, but the view which is most likely to be correct is that it 
    is not allowed at all, based on the general meaning of the ahaadeeth, 
    because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, 
    “I do not shake hands with women,” and so as to ward off the means (that may 
    lead to immoral actions). And Allaah knows best.

This includes all kinds of dealings, buying, selling, compromising, appointing others to act on their behalf, lending, depositing trusts, etc. 
Islam enjoined upon women the acts of worship and duties that befit them, the same duties as men, namely purification, zakaah, fasting, prayer, Hajj, and other acts of worship. 
But Islam gives a woman half the share of a man when it comes to inheritance, because she is not obliged to spend on herself or her house or her children. Rather the one who is obliged to spend on them is the man, just as the man is responsible for spending on guests, contributing to payment of ransom money, and spending on reconciling between conflicting groups. 
With regard to the testimony of two women being equivalent to the testimony of one man in some cases, that is because women tend to be more forgetful than men because of their natural cycles of menstruation, pregnancy, giving birth, raising children etc. All these things preoccupy them and make them forgetful. Hence the shar’i evidence indicates that another women should reinforce a woman’s testimony, so that it will be more accurate. But there are matters that pertain only to women in which the testimony of a single woman is sufficient, such as determining how often a child was breastfed, faults that may affect marriage, and so on. 
Women are equal with men in terms of reward, remaining steadfast in faith and doing righteous deeds, in enjoying a good life in this world and a great reward in the Hereafter. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Whoever works righteousness — whether male or female — while he (or she) is a true believer (of Islamic Monotheism) verily, to him We will give a good life (in this world with respect, contentment and lawful provision), and We shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion to the best of what they used to do (i.e. Paradise in the Hereafter)” [al-Nahl 16:97]
So we know that women have rights and duties, just as men have rights and duties. There are matters which suit men so Allah has made them the responsibility of men, just as there are manners which suit women so He has made them the responsibility of women. 
And Allah is the Source of strength.

12841,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12841,Travelling to seek knowledge without parents’ permission,Do I have the right to leave to another country to seek knowledge of the Deen without their permission? What if they refuse to allow me? I read that Imaam Ahmad did not see anything wrong with that.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Seeking knowledge, if this knowledge is something obligatory, is not dependent on having parents’ permission, but if it is supererogatory knowledge then it is essential to have their permission. 
Muslim (2549) narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas said: A man came to the Prophet of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: “I give you my oath of allegiance, promising to migrate and fight in jihad, seeking the reward of Allaah.” He said, “Are either of your parents alive?” He said, “Yes, both of them.” He said, “And do you want to seek the reward of Allaah?” He said, “Yes.” He said, “Then go back to your parents, and keep good company with them.” 
Seeking knowledge is one of the kinds of jihad. It is not permissible to pursue supererogatory kinds of knowledge which dictates travelling and leaving them, without their permission. 
Ibn Muflih said in al-Adaab al-Shar’iyyah (2/35-36): 
With regard to the one who goes out seeking knowledge, he must go out with the permission of his parents, because the virtue of supererogatory actions cannot be sought without the permission of one's parents.  
Al-Marwadhi said to Abu ‘Abd-Allaah (i.e., Imam Ahmad): What do you think of a man who is seeking knowledge and he asks his mother for permission, and she gives him permission, even though he knows that she would prefer him to stay? He said, If he is ignorant and does not know how to issue a shar’i divorce or how to pray, then I prefer him to seek knowledge, but if he knows that then I prefer him to stay with her. 
Al-Khallaal narrated that a man asked him: I am seeking knowledge, but my mother does not want me to do that; she wants me to engage in business. He said to me, Do your best to please her, but do not stop seeking knowledge.  
He said to him: I am a stranger in the land seeking knowledge. Is that better or should I go back to my mother? He said, If you are seeking knowledge that is essential then there is nothing wrong with that. 
A man asked him: I have just arrived and I do not know anything, what do you command me to do? Abu ‘Abd-Allaah said to him: You have to seek knowledge. 
Ishaaq ibn Ibraaheem said: I asked Abu ‘Abd-Allaah about a man who has two well off parents and wants to seek knowledge of hadeeth, and they do not give him permission. He said, He should seek as much knowledge as will benefit him, and there is nothing as good as knowledge. 
It is clear from the above that what is meant by the words of Imam Ahmad is: If the knowledge is obligatory then parents’ permission is not essential, and if it is supererogatory then it is essential to have their permission.

The mother of the faithful, Umm Habibah Ramlah bint Abu Sufyan, narrated  that she heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saying: “A house will be built in paradise for every Muslim who offers twelve rak`ahs of optional prayer other than the obligatory prayer in a day and night, to seek the pleasure of Allah.” (Narrated by Muslim)

Note: These extra 12 rak`ahs of optional prayers , according to Imam An-Nasai and at-Tirmidhi are: 2 rak`ahs before the obligatory prayer of early morning (Fajr), and 4 rak`ahs before (Zuhr) and 2 rak`ahs after it ,and 2 rak`ahs after the obligatory prayer of early evening prayer (Magrib) and 2 rak`ahs after the obligatory prayer of night (`Isha) prayer.

Abu Hurairah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “My friend, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) advised me to observe three things and I shall not leave them till I die: 1. “To observe fasting three days every (lunar) month; 2.” To offer the Duha prayer ; 3. To offer Witr prayer before sleeping.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim)
`Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The two rak`ahs before dawn (Fajr) prayer are better than the world and all that it contains.” (Narrated by Muslim)
`Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was never more regular and strict in offering any voluntary prayers than the two rak`ahs (sunnah before) dawn (Fajr) prayer. (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)
Umm Habibah (may Allah be pleased with her) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever observes the practice of offering four rak`ahs before Zuhr prayer and four rak`ahs after it. Allah will shield him against the fire of hell.” (Narrated bay Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi)
One should make Witr as the last prayer (prayer) (at night).

‘Abdullah bin ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Make Witr as your last prayer (prayer) at night.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)

If anyone enters a mosque, he should offer two rak`ah before sitting.

Abu Qatada (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If any one of you enters a mosque, he should pray two rak`ahs before sitting.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)

Abu Hurairah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that Allah’s Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to Bilal (may Allah be pleased with him) “Tell me about the most hopeful act (i.e. one which you deem the most rewarding with Allah) you  have done since your acceptance of Islam because I heard the sound of the steps of your shoes in front of me in Paradise.” Bilal said: “I do not consider any act more hopeful than that whenever I make  ablution (wudu) at any time of night or day, I offer prayer (prayer) for as long as was destined for me to offer.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)

12852,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12852,Is it permissible for the husband’s brother to take his brother’s wife to the doctor?,"Is it permissible for the husband’s brother to take his brother’s wife to the doctor, if his brother is not there, or if he cannot be there, and the hospital is in the same city?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    It is not permissible for the wife to travel in a car alone 
    with her husband’s brother, because that comes under the heading of khulwah 
    (being alone with a member of the opposite sex) which the Messenger  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) warned against when he said: 
    “Beware of entering upon women.” They said: “O Messenger of Allaah, what 
    about the in-law?” He said: “The in-law is death.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari 
    and Muslim. 

    What do you understand from these words? Is it forbidden or 
    allowed? Undoubtedly what is meant is that it is forbidden and not allowed. 
    So it is not permissible for a man to be alone with his brother’s wife, 
    either in a car or in the house. Worse than that is what some people do when 
    a guest comes when the man is at work, and there is no one in the house 
    except his wife, then she opens the door to him and he goes in and waits for 
    the owner of the house to come home. The point is that it is not permissible 
    for any woman to be alone with any man (i.e., non mahrams) even if he is one 
    of her husband’s relatives or one of her relatives or neighbours, unless she 
    has a mahram with her, whether that is in her home town or when travelling. 
    It should also be noted that it is haraam for her to travel even if there is 
    no khulwah, if she does not have a mahram with her, because of the hadeeth 
    of Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) which is narrated in 
    al-Saheehayn. He said: I heard the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) delivered a khutbah and said: “No man should be alone 
    with a woman unless there is a mahram with her, and no woman should travel 
    without a mahram.”","Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen ، Majmoo’at As’ilah tahumm al-Usrah al-Muslimah, p. 46-47"
12853,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12853,There is nothing wrong with a woman wearing a white wedding dress,Is it permissible for a woman to wear a white wedding dress on the wedding night? Or is it haraam because this is the dress of kaafir women?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with a woman wearing a white wedding dress on condition that she does not appear in it in front of men who are not her mahrams, because usually wedding dresses are adorned and decorated, and we have already stated in the answer to question no.  39570 that one of the conditions of women’s hijab is that it should not be an adornment in and of itself. 
It is also essential that this dress does not reveal any of the woman’s charms, even if she is only going to appear in front of women in it. See question no.  6569 and 34745. 
With regard to it being the dress of kaafir women, that is not the case. Rather many Muslim women nowadays, if not most of them, wear this kind of dress. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was asked: 
What is the ruling on a woman wearing white for her wedding as it is known that this is an imitation of the kuffaar? 
He replied: 
It is permissible for a woman to wear white so long as it is not in the same form as men’s clothing. With regard to it being an imitation of the kuffaar, that is no longer the case, because now all Muslim women wear such clothes when they are getting married. The ruling depends on whether the reason for it is present or not. If it is no longer an imitation of the kuffaar and this has now become something that is common to both Muslims and kaafirs, then the ruling no longer applies, unless something is haraam in and of itself and not because it is an imitation of others. Such things are haraam in all cases.

12874,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12874,Ruling on studying man-made laws,"What is the ruling on studying man-made laws, and teaching them?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.There is no doubt that Allah has enjoined upon His slaves to rule according to His sharee’ah and to refer to it for judgement, and He has warned against ruling by any other laws and has stated that this is the characteristic of the hypocrites. He has also stated that any rule other than His rule is the rule of Jaahiliyyah (ignorance) and that there is nothing better than His rule. Allah tells us that people do not truly believe until they refer to His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) for judgement in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against his decisions, and accept (them) with full submission. In Soorat al-Maa'idah Allah tells us that ruling by anything other than that which He has revealed is kufr (disbelief), wrongdoing and evildoing. All these things that we have mentioned here are clearly stated by Allah in His Book.
 With regard to those who study and teach man-made laws, they fall into different categories: 
-1-
Those who study it or teach it in order to understand its real nature, or to understand the superiority of sharee’ah to these laws, or to benefit from it in ways that do not go against sharee’ah, or to benefit others in such ways. It seems that there is no sin on the one who does this, indeed he may be rewarded for that if he seeks to expose its faults and demonstrate the superiority of sharee’ah. The ruling on people in this category is the same as the ruling on those who study the rulings on riba and the various kinds of alcohol and gambling, and false beliefs, or who teach about such matters so that he may know them and the Islamic rulings on them, or he may inform others of that, whilst also believing that they are haraam, just as those in this category who study law believe that man-made laws which go against the laws of Allah are haraam. They do not come under the same ruling as those who learn or teach witchcraft and the like, because witchcraft is haraam in and of itself, as it involves shirk and worship of the jinn instead of Allah. So the one who learns it or teaches it to others only attains it by means of shirk, unlike the one who studies law or teaches it to others, not because he thinks that it is permissible, but for a permissible or Islamically prescribed purpose, as stated above. 
-2-
Those who study law or teach it to others in order to pass judgements thereby or to help others to do so, even though they believe that it is haraam to rule by anything other than that which Allah has revealed. But their desires or love of money makes them do that. These people are undoubtedly doing wrong and they are committing kufr, wrongdoing and evil, but it is minor kufr, minor wrongdoing and minor evil that does not put them beyond the pale of Islam. This view is well known among the scholars. It is also the view of Ibn ‘Abbaas, Tawoos, ‘Ata’, Mujaahid and a number of the earlier and later generations, as was stated by al-Haafiz ibn Katheer, al-Baghawi, al-Qurtubi and others. The great scholar Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) also mentioned something similar in his book Kitaab al-Salaah. Shaykh ‘Abd al-Lateef ibn ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Hasan (may Allah have mercy on him) wrote an excellent essay on this topic which has been published in the third volume of al-Rasaa’il al-Oola. 
Those who learn and teach man-made systems of law are likened to those who learn about different kinds of riba, alcohol and gambling and teach them to others for some whims and desires of their own or because of their greed for money, even though they do not regard that as permissible. They know that all dealings involving riba are haraam, just as they know that drinking intoxicants and gambling are haraam, but because they are weak in faith and are overwhelmed by whims and desires or greed for money, their belief that these things are haraam does not stop them from dealing in these forbidden things. According to the belief of Ahl al-Sunnah, they are not regarded as kaafirs because of their dealing in those things, so long as they do not believe that that is permissible.
 -3-
Whoever studies or teaches manmade laws and believes that ruling by them is permissible, whether he believes that sharee’ah is superior to them or not, is a kaafir in the sense of major kufr, according to the consensus of the Muslims, because by believing that it is permissible to rule by man-made laws that go against sharee’ah he is regarding as permissible something that no Muslim has any excuse for not knowing that it is haraam. So he comes under the same ruling as one who regards adultery or alcohol etc as permissible, and because by believing these laws to be permissible he is disbelieving in Allah and His Messenger and rejecting the Quran and Sunnah. The scholars of Islam are unanimously agreed that the one who regards as permissible something that Allah has forbidden, or regards as forbidden something that Allah has permitted, which is well known in Islam and no Muslim has any excuse for not knowing it, is a kaafir. Whoever studies the words of the scholars of all four madhhabs on the rulings on apostates will understand what we have said clearly.","Majmoo’Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 2/325-331"
