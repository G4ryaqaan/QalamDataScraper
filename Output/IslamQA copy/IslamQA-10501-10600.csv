10505,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10505,Advice after Ramadaan,What advice can you give after Ramadaan?,,,"Praise be to Allah.I wonder whether the fasting person continued after Ramadaan to be as he was during Ramadaan, or is he “like her who undoes the thread which she has spun, after it has become strong” [cf. al-Nahl 16:92]? I wonder whether the one who during Ramadaan was fasting, reciting and reading Qur’aan, giving and spending in charity, praying at night, making du’aa’, will he be like that after Ramadaan, or will he follow another path, I mean the path of the Shaytaan, so that he commits sin and does things that anger the Most Gracious, Most Merciful? 
If a Muslim continues to have the patience to do righteous deeds after Ramadaan, this is a sign that his (fasting) has been accepted by his Lord, the Most Generous, the Bestower of blessings. If he fails to do righteous deeds after Ramadaan, and follows the ways of the Shaytaan, this is a sign of humiliation, meanness, lowly status and being deprived of the help of Allaah, as al-Hasan al-Basri said: “They were no longer of any significance to Allaah, so they committed sin. If they had mattered to Him, He would have protected them.” When a person becomes insignificant to Allaah, Allaah will no longer honour him. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And whomsoever Allaah disgraces, none can honour him” [al-Hajj 22:18]  
What is amazing is that during Ramadaan, you see some people who fast and pray at night, who spend in charity and worship the Lord of the Worlds, then no sooner has the month come to an end, but their nature changes completely, and they begin to have a bad attitude towards their Lord. So you see  them neglecting prayer and avoiding righteous deeds, committing sins and disobeying Allaah in many different ways, keeping away from obedience towards Allaah, the Sovereign, the Holy, the One Free from all defects.
 How terrible it is, by Allaah, when people only acknowledge Allaah in Ramadaan.
 The Muslim should make Ramadaan an opportunity to turn over a new leaf by repenting, turning to Allaah, persisting in worshipping Allaah, always being aware that Allaah is watching at every minute of every hour. So after Ramadaan the Muslim should continue to obey Allaah and should avoid sin and evil actions, as a continuation of the way he was during Ramadaan and the things that he did then to draw closer to the Lord of creation. 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And perform As‑Salaah (Iqaamat‑as‑ Salaah), at the two ends of the day and in some hours of the night [i.e. the five compulsory Salaah (prayers)]. Verily, the good deeds remove the evil deeds (i.e. small sins). That is a reminder (an advice) for the mindful (those who accept advice)”[Hood 11:114] 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Follow a bad deed with a good deed, for it will wipe it out; and have a good attitude and good manners towards people.” 
Undoubtedly the purpose for which Allaah created everyone was to worship Him Alone, with no partner or associate. This is the ultimate purpose and the highest aim, which is to attain ‘uboodiyyah (being a slave of Allaah in the truest and fullest sense). This was achieved in the most beautiful manner during Ramadaan, when we saw people going to the houses of Allaah in groups and individually, and we saw them striving to perform the obligatory prayers on time and to give in charity, competing with one another in doing good deeds. And for this let (all) those strive who want to strive (cf. al-Mutaffifeen 83:26), for they will be rewarded in sha Allaah. But there remains the case of those whom Allaah keeps firm with the word that stands firm in this world and in the Hereafter (cf. Ibraaheem 14:27). Whomever Allaah helps to be steadfast in doing righteous deeds after Ramadaan, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“To Him ascend (all) the goodly words, and the righteous deeds exalt it (i.e. the goodly words are not accepted by Allaah unless and until they are followed by good deeds), but those who plot evils, theirs will be severe torment. And the plotting of such will perish”[Faatir 35:10] 
Undoubtedly righteous deeds are among the acts which bring a person closer to Allaah at all times, and the Lord of Ramadaan is also the Lord of Jumaada and Sha’baan and Dhu’l-Hijjah and Muharram and Safar and all the other months. That is because the worship that Allaah has enjoined upon us includes five pillars, one of which is fasting, which is for a set period which has come to an end. But there remain other pillars, Hajj, prayer and zakaah, for which we are answerable to Allaah. We must perform these duties in the manner which is pleasing to Allaah, and we must strive thereby to fulfil the purpose for which we were created. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And I (Allaah) created not the jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone)”[al-Dhaariyaat 51:56] 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) taught his Companions to compete in doing good, and he said, “One dirham may weigh more with Allaah than a dinar, and the best of charity is that a man gives when he is rich.” He (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) explained that if the person gives charity when he is disinclined to do so and is in good health, but fears poverty, that charity will weigh heavily with Allaah in the balance of good deeds; whereas the one who delays it, then when he gets sick he starts to spend in charity here and there, fearing that his good deeds will be rejected, there is the danger that his (charity) will not be accepted – we seek refuge with Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Allaah accepts only the repentance of those who do evil in ignorance and foolishness and repent soon afterwards; it is they whom Allaah will forgive and Allaah is Ever All Knower, All‑Wise.
And of no effect is the repentance of those who continue to do evil deeds until death faces one of them and he says: “Now I repent;” nor of those who die while they are disbelievers. For them We have prepared a painful torment”[al-Nisaa’ 4:17-18] 
The pious and sincere believer should fear Allaah and strive to obey Allaah at all times, persisting in his taqwa and always striving to do good, call others to Allaah, enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil. For the believer, his days and nights in this world are storehouses, so let him see what he can deposit in them. If he deposits good things in them, it will testify in his favour before his Lord on the Day of Resurrection; if it is the opposite, then it will be a disaster for him. We ask Allaah to save us and you from that loss.
The scholars (may Allaah have mercy on them) said:
Among the signs of acceptance (of good deeds) is that Allaah causes one hasanah (good deed) to be followed by another, for the hasanah says, “My sister, my sister!” And the sayi’ah (evil deed) also says, “My sister, my sister!” –we seek refuge with Allaah. If Allaah has accepted a person's Ramadaan, and he has benefited from this period of (spiritual) training and has remained steadfast in obeying Allaah, then he has joined the caravan of those who have remained steadfast and responded to Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Verily, those who say: ‘Our Lord is Allaah (Alone),’ and then they stand firm, on them the angels will descend (at the time of their death) (saying): ‘Fear not, nor grieve! But receive the glad tidings of Paradise which you have been promised!
We have been your friends in the life of this world and are (so) in the Hereafter. Therein you shall have (all) that your inner selves desire, and therein you shall have (all) for which you ask”[Fussilat 41:30-31] 
“And whosoever takes Allaah, His Messenger, and those who have believed, as Protectors, then the party of Allaah will be the victorious” [al-Maa’idah 5:56] 
“Verily, those who say: “Our Lord is (only) Allaah,” and thereafter stand firm (on the Islamic Faith of Monotheism), on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve” [al-Ahqaaf 46:13]
 This standing firm should continue from one Ramadaan to the next, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “From one prayer to the next, from one Ramadaan to the next, from one Hajj to the next, this expiates for whatever (sins) were committed from one to the next, so long as you avoid major sins.” And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“If you avoid the great sins which you are forbidden to do, We shall expiate from you your (small) sins, and admit you to a Noble Entrance (i.e. Paradise)” [al-Nisaa’ 4:31] 
The believer should join the caravan of those who stand firm and should board the ship of salvation from the time when he reaches the earliest age of discretion until he draws his last breath. He should remain in the shade of “Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah”, enjoying the blessings of Allaah. This religion is the truth and the way in which we steadfastly adhere to it in Ramadaan is that with which Allaah honours us by the bounty of His giving, His gracious blessing and His great favour, so that we might continue to pray qiyaam and to worship Him after the month of Ramadaan. Do not forget, my brother, that Allaah has blessed you with i’tikaaf, and Allaah has blessed you with giving charity, and Allaah has blessed you with fasting, and Allaah has blessed you with du’aa’ which has been accepted. Do not forget, my brother, to take care of these good deeds and this support from Allaah, and do not let them be wiped out by bad deeds. So strive to cultivate goodness and happiness on your way, and to keep company with those who remain steadfast (in Islam), and to seek Allaah and His Messenger and the Home of the Hereafter, where it will be said to you, Receive glad tidings of Paradise as wide as the heavens and the earth, prepared for the pious, for you responded to the call of Allaah; O seeker of good, continue, for Allaah has some people who will be freed from Hell, and O seeker of evil, desist. And you responded to the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “Whoever prays at night during Ramadaan out of faith and hoping for reward, his previous sins will be forgiven. And whoever prays at night during Laylat al-Qadr out of faith and hoping for reward, his previous sins will be forgiven.” 
I ask Allaah Who has blessed us and you with fasting, i’tikaaf, ‘umrah and charity to bless us with guidance, piety, and acceptance of our good deeds; may He help us to persist in doing good deeds and to remain steadfast, for persistence in doing good deeds is one of the greatest means of drawing closer to Allaah. Hence when a man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said, “Advise me,” he said, “Say, ‘I believe in Allaah,’ and remain steadfast.” (Agreed upon). 
According to a report narrated by Ahmad, he said, “Say, I believe in Allaah,’ then remain steadfast.” [The man] said, “O Messenger of Allaah, all the people say that.” He said, “Some people who came before you said that, but they did not remain steadfast.” So the believers must continue to be steadfast in obeying Allaah:
“Allaah will keep firm those who believe, with the word that stands firm in this world (i.e. they will keep on worshipping Allaah Alone and none else), and in the Hereafter. And Allaah will cause to go astray those who are Zaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers), and Allaah does what He wills”[Ibraaheem 14:27 – interpretation of the meaning] 
The one who is steadfast in obeying Allaah is the one whose du’aa’ will be answered, the du’aa’ which he repeats more than twenty-five times each day, “Guide us to the Straight Way” [al-Faatihah 1:6 – interpretation of the meaning], which we say in al-Faatihah. Why is it that we say and believe strongly that if we remain steadfast Allaah will forgive us, but we are too lazy to apply that in practical terms? We should fear Allaah and apply this in deed and thought and word. We should strive in the way of “ihdinaa al-siraat al-mustaqeem (Guide us to the Straight Way)”, and we should travel the route of “iyaaka na’budu wa iyyaaka nasta’een (You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything))” [al-Faatihah 1:5 – interpretation of the meaning], in the shade of “ihdinaa al-siraat al-mustaqeem (Guide us to the Straight Way)”, following the route that will lead us to Paradise the width of the heavens and the earth, whose key is Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah. I ask Allaah to grant us and you a good end.
 After the end of Ramadaan, the people are divided into various types, two of the most prominent of which I will describe here. The first type are those whom you see in Ramadaan striving hard in worship. You never see them but they are prostrating or standing in prayer, or reading Qur’aan, or weeping, so much that they remind you of some of the worshippers among the salaf, and you even feel compassion for them because of the intensity of their efforts and striving. Yet hardly has the month ended, before they go back to negligence and committing sin, as if they were prisoners of that worship, so they turn their attention to their desires and become negligent and commit sins which they think will take away their distress and grief. But these poor people forget that sin is the cause of doom, because sins are like war wounds, one of which may turn out to be fatal. How often has sin prevented a person from saying Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah when in the throes of death. 
After spending this entire month with faith, (reading) Qur’aan and other acts of worship, these people then backslide, Laa hawla wa laa quwwata illa Billaah (there is no power and no strength except with Allaah).  These are the occasional worshippers who only acknowledge Allaah on certain occasions or at times of calamity and distress, then after that there is no more obedience or worship. What a bad habit that is. 
“The worshipper prayed for something that he wanted, and when the matter was done, he neither prayed nor fasted.” [Arabic poetry]
 I wonder what is the point of worshipping for a whole month, if that is going to be followed by a return to dishonourable ways?
 The second type are those who feel distressed at the departure of Ramadaan, because they have tasted the sweetness of being safe from sin, and the bitterness of patience became insignificant to them, because they came to realize the true nature of their weakness and need for their Master (Allaah) and their need to obey Him. They fasted in a true sense and stood in prayer at night out of love, so when they bade farewell to Ramadaan, their tears flowed and their hearts were broken. Those among them who were burdened with sin hoped to be freed from sin and ransomed from Hell, and to join the caravan of those who are accepted. Ask yourself, my brother, which of the two groups do you belong to? 
By Allaah, are they the same? Praise be to Allaah, but most of them do not know. The mufassireen said, commenting on the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):
“Say (O Muhammad to mankind): ‘Each one does according to Shakilatihi (i.e. his way or his religion or his intentions)…”
[al-Israa’ 17:84] – every person acts according to his way or the character that he is used to. This is condemnation for the kaafir and praise for the believer. 
You should know that the dearest of deeds to Allaah are those that are continuous, even if they are little. The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “O people, you must do whatever you can of good deeds, for Allaah does not get tired until you get tired. The most beloved of deeds to Allaah are those which are continuous, even if they are little. The family of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), when they did something, they would persist in doing it.” Narrated by Muslim. 
When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was asked about which deeds are most beloved to Allaah, he said, “Those which are continuous, even if they are little.” 
‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) was asked about what the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did and whether he used to do certain things on particular days. She said, “No, his good deeds were continuous. Who among you could do what the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to do?” The acts of worship prescribed in Islam are based on certain conditions which must be fulfilled, like remembrance of Allaah, Hajj and ‘Umrah and their naafil actions, enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, seeking knowledge, jihaad, and other good deeds. So strive to worship continuously according to your capability. 
May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions, and grant them peace.","From al-Da’wah magazine, issue no. 1774, p. 12"

10508,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10508,Unrestricted Takbeer or Takbeer restricted to certain times during the days of Dhu’l-Hijjah,"About unrestricted Takbeer during Eid al-Adha – is the Takbeer following every prayer included in the unrestricted Takbeer? Is it Sunnah, mustahabb or bid’ah?",,,"Praise be to Allah.With regard to Takbeer on (Eid al-) Adhaa, it is prescribed from the beginning of the month until the end of the thirteenth day of Dhu’l-Hijjah, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“That they may witness things that are of benefit to them (i.e. reward of Hajj in the Hereafter, and also some worldly gain from trade), and mention the Name of Allah on appointed days”
[al-Hajj 22:28]
- which are the ten days; and because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And remember Allah during the appointed Days [These are the three days of staying at Mina during the Hajj; 11th, 12th and 13th days of the month of Dhul-Hijjah]” [al-Baqarah 2:203]
- which are the days of Tashreeq.  
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The days of Tashreeq are the days of eating, drinking and remembering Allah.” (Narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh). Al-Bukhaari mentioned in his Saheeh, in a mu’allaq report, that Ibn ‘Umar and Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with them both) used to go out to the market-place on first ten days of Dhu’l-Hijjah, reciting Takbeer, and the people used to recite Takbeer because of their Takbeer. ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab and his son ‘Abd-Allah (may Allah be pleased with them both) used to recite Takbeer during the days of Mina in the mosque and in the camps, and they would raise their voices until Mina echoed with their Takbeer. It was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and a group of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) used to recite Takbeer following each of the five prayers from Fajr on the day of ‘Arafaah until ‘Asr on the thirteenth day of Dhu’l-Hijjah. This applies to those who are not on Hajj; for those who are on Hajj, they should concentrate on their ihraam and recite the Talbiyah, until they throw the stones at Jamarat al-‘Aqabah on the Day of Sacrifice (Yawm al-Nahr); after that they may recite Takbeer. The Takbeer should start with the first stone thrown at the Jamarah mentioned. If the pilgrim recites the Takbeer along with the Talbiyah, that is OK, because Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “Some would recite the Talbiyah on the Day of ‘Arafaah, and they were not told off for doing so, and some would recite Takbeer and they were not told off for doing so.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari). But it is better for the one who is in ihraam to recite the Talbiyah and for the one who is not in ihraam to recite Takbeer on the days mentioned. 
Hence we know that according to the most correct scholarly view, unrestricted takbeer and takbeer restricted to certain times are combined on five days, i.e., the Day of ‘Arafaah, the Day of Sacrifice and the three days of Tashreeq. With regard to the eighth day (of Dhu’l-Hijjah) and the days preceding it, Takbeer on those days may be done at any times, not only at certain times, because of the aayahs and reports mentioned above. In al-Musnad it is narrated from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There are no days on which good deeds are greater or more beloved to Allah than on these ten days, so recite much Tahleel (saying Laa ilaaha ill-Allah), Takbeer (saying Allahu akbar) and Tahmeed (saying al-hamdu Lillaah),” or similar words.","Kitaab Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah li Samaahat al-Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz , vol. 13, p. 17"

In our country they make the woman furnish the house. Is it obligatory on the wife to pay part of her mahr towards furnishing the house?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The mahr is the exclusive right of the women, to dispose of as she wishes. She does not have to prepare the house, because there is no text in the sources of sharee’ah which state that the wife is under any obligation to prepare the marital home. There is nothing to state that her parents are obliged to prepare the house either. No one has the right to force her to do that. If she does anything to prepare the house or the furnishings and equipment that are needed, this is voluntary on her part. 
Preparing the house is an obligation on the husband. He is the one who has to do everything that is needed to prepare the marital home by supplying furnishings, conveniences, equipment and whatever else is needed in the home, because that is all part of the spending which he is obliged to spend on his wife.","Al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, vol. 39, p. 206"
10510,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10510,Repenting from gambling,I have gambled a lot. How can I repent from that?,,,"Praise be to Allah.You have to give up gambling straight away and keep away from the people who do it, from the places where it happens and from gambling machines. You have to regret what has happened in the past, and resolve not to return to it. You also have to give in charity, because it was narrated by Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever swears and says in his oath ‘By al-Laat and al-‘Uzza,’ let him say ‘Laa ilaaha ill-Allah (there is no god but Allah).’ And whoever says to his companion, ‘Come on, let’s gamble,’ let him give in charity.” 
Al-Nawawi said: the scholars said, he enjoined charity as an expiation for the sin of speaking these words. Al-Khattaabi said, What it means is that he should give in charity the amount that he wanted to gamble. 
Al-Nawawi said, the correct view is that which was stated by the scholars, and which is the apparent meaning of the hadeeth, that it does not have to be this specific amount, but that he should give in charity whatever he can, of things that are counted as charity. This is supported by the report which says, “Let him give something in charity.”","Al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah , vol. 39, p. 407"

Off and on I would pick up on a little activity from this jinn or even jinns, like doors opening by themselves, seeing it, hearing them etc... However, things seem to be changing a lot. 
Now something is happening every day and things are making me uncomfortable in my home to the point where I do not want to live here anymore. The jinn(s) open doors, shout my name startling me out of sleep, knock over objects, appear as a cat, are messing with my computer and phones, I see its shadows and even more. It is very freaky. 
I am really not sure what to do about this problem. I am hoping moving out of this house will help the situation...? But in the meantime I have tried to recite Al-Baqarah, Al-Ikhlas, Al-Falaq, An-Nas and even play a recording of the recitation in my house. The activity stops when I do so but as soon as I stop the recording the jinn makes its presence known in some way or other (most of the time). 
Sometimes, my recording will be shut off and my computer resets in the middle of the recitation...which apparently has happened too many times. Jinn even appear to me in dreams very often.

Can the jinn harm humans?


Du’a for protection from the jinn","Praise be to Allah.Can we see the jinn?
The questioner is mistaken in saying that she has seen a jinn, because the jinn can see us but they cannot be seen by us. 
Al-Shafi’i said:
“Whoever is of sound character and claims to have seen the jinn, his testimony is no longer valid, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
‘Verily, he and qabiluhu (his soldiers from the jinn or his tribe) see you from where you cannot see them’ [Al-A`raf 7:27] –unless  he is a Prophet.” (Ahkam al-Quran) 
Ibn Hazm said:  
“The jinn are real , and they are creatures created by Allah. Among them are kafirs (non-Muslims) and believers. They can see us but we cannot see them. They eat, have children and die. Allah says (interpretation of the meanings): 
‘O you assembly of jinn and mankind!’ [Al-An`am 6:130] 
‘And the jinn, We created aforetime from the smokeless flame of fire’ [Al-Hijr 15:27] 
‘”And of us some are Muslims (who have submitted to Allah, after listening to this Quran), and of us some are al-qasitun (disbelievers, those who have deviated from the right path)’. And whosoever has embraced Islam (i.e. has become a Muslim by submitting to Allah), then such have sought the right path. And as for the qasitun (disbelievers who deviated from the right path), they shall be firewood for Hell”’ [Al-Jinn72:14-15] 
‘Verily, he and qabiluhu (his soldiers from the jinn or his tribe) see you from where you cannot see them’ [Al-A`raf 7:27] 
‘Will you then take him (Iblis) and his offspring as protectors and helpers rather than Me’ [Al-Kahf 18:50] 
‘Whatsoever is on it (the earth) will perish’ [Ar-Rahman 55:26] 
‘Everyone shall taste death’ [al `Imran 3:185].”  (al-Muhalla) 
Hence what the questioner has seen may be just her imagination or an illusion, or it may be jinn appearing in a form other than that in which Allah has created them. 
Can the jinn harm humans?
With regard to the jinn harming humans , this is proven to happen and it does happen. Protection against that is attained by reciting Quran and adhkar (dhikr/remembrance of Allah) prescribed in shari’ah (Islamic law). 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Undoubtedly the jinn can have a harmful effect on humans , and they could even kill them. They may harm a person by throwing stones at him, or by trying to terrify him, and other things that are proven in the sunnah (prophetic teachings) or indicated by real events. It was reported that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) gave permission to one of his Companions to go to his wife during one of the military campaigns – I think it was the campaign of al-Khandaq – as he was a young man who had recently got married. When he reached his house, he found his wife standing at the door, and he objected to that. She said to him, ‘Go inside,’ so he went inside and found a snake curled up on the bed. He had a spear with him, so he stabbed it with the spear until it died, and at the same instant as the snake died the man also died. It was not known which of them died first, the snake or the man. When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) heard of that, he forbade killing the harmless kinds of snakes that are found in houses, apart from those which are maimed or are streaked and malignant. 
This indicates that the jinn may attack humans, and that they may harm them, as is known from real-life events. There are numerous reports which indicate that a man may come to a deserted area, and a stone may be thrown at him, but he does not see anybody, or he may hear voices or a rustling sound like the rustling of trees, and other things that may make him feel distressed and scared. A jinn may also enter the body of a human, either because of love or with the intention of harming him, or for some other reason. This is indicated in the ayah/verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
‘Those who eat riba (interest) will not stand (on the Day of Resurrection) except like the standing of a person beaten by shaytan leading him to insanity’ [Al-Baqarah 2:275]
In such cases, the jinn may speak from inside of that person and address the one who is reading verses from the Quran over him; the reciter may take a promise from the jinn never to come back, and other things concerning which there are very many reports which are widespread among the people. 
So the protection which will prevent the evil of the jinn is for a person to recite that which is narrated in the sunnah as being effective in providing protection, such as Ayat al-Kuris, for if a person recites Ayat al-Kursi at night, he will continue to have protection from Allah, and no shaytan will come near him until morning. And Allah is the Protector.’” (Majmu’ Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin) 
Du’a for protection from the jinn
The sunnah mentions adhkhar by means of which one may gain protection from the shayatin (devils). These include: 
1- Seeking refuge with Allah from the jinn: 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And if an evil whisper from shaytan tries to turn you away (O Muhammad) (from doing good), then seek refuge in Allah. Verily, He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower” [Fussilat 41:36] 
“And if an evil whisper comes to you from shaytan, then seek refuge with Allah. Verily, He is All-Hearer, All-Knower” [Al-A'raf 7:200] 
Sulayman ibn Sard narrated that two men were trading insults in the presence of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon them), until the face of one of them turned red. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “I know a word which, if he were to say it, what he is suffering from would go away: ‘A’udhu Billahi min al-Shaytan il-rajim (I seek refuge with Allah from the accursed shaytan).’” (al-Bukhari and Muslim)
2 – Reciting al-Mu’awwidhatayn (the last two chapters of the Quran, al-Falaq and al-Nas). 
Abu Sa’id al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to seek refuge with Allah from the jinn and from the evil eye until the Mu’awwidhatayn were revealed, and when they were revealed he started to recite them and not anything else.” (al-Tirmidhi, al-Nasai, Ibn Majah) 
3 – Reciting Ayat al-Kursi
Abu Hurayrah said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) put me in charge of guarding the zakah (charity) of Ramadan. Someone came to me and started grabbing handfuls of the food. I took hold of him and said, ‘I will take you to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).’ He said, ‘I will teach you some words by means of which Allah will benefit you.’ I said, ‘What are they?’ He said, ‘When you go to your bed, recite this ayah (interpretation of the meaning): “Allah! La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), Al-Hayyul-Qayyum (the Ever Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists)…” [2:255] – until he completed the ayah. Then Allah will appoint a guard for you who will stay with you and no shaytan (devil) will come near you until morning.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked me, ‘What did your prisoner do last night?’ I said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, he taught me something, and claimed that Allah would benefit me by it.’ He said, ‘What was it?’ I said, ‘He taught me to recite Ayat al-Kursi when I go to bed, and said that no shaytan would come near me until morning, and that Allah would appoint a guard for me who would stay with me.’ The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ‘He told you the truth, although he is an inveterate liar. That was the shaytan.’” (al-Bukhari) 
4 – Reciting Surat al-Baqarah
It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not make your houses like graves, for the shaytan runs away from a house in which Surat al-Baqarah is recited.” (Muslim) 
5 – The last verses of Surat al-Baqarah
Abu Mas’ud al-Ansari said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Whoever recites the last two verses of Surat al-Baqarah at night, that will suffice him.’” (al-Bukhari, Muslim) 
Al-Nu’man ibn Bashir (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah inscribed a book two thousand years before He created the heavens and the earth, from which the last two ayahs of Surat al-Baqarah were revealed. If they are recited for three nights, no shaytan (devil) will remain in the house”. (al-Tirmidhi).
6 – Reciting “La ilaha ill-Allah wahdahu la sharika lah, lahu’l-mulk wa lahu’l-hamd wa huwa ‘ala kulli shayin qadir (There is no god except Allah Alone with no partner or associate; His is the Sovereignty and His is the praise, and He is able to do all things)” one hundred times. 
Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)  said: “Whoever says “La ilaha ill-Allah wahdahu la sharika lah, lahu’l-mulk wa lahu’l-hamd wa huwa ‘ala kulli shayin qadir” one hundred times in the day, will have a reward equivalent to that of freeing ten slaves, one hundred hasanahs (good deeds) will be recorded for him, and one hundred sayyiahs (bad deeds) will be erased from his record, and it will be protection for him from the shaytan for that day, until evening comes. No one could achieve any better than him except the one who does more than he did.”  (al-Bukhari, Muslim) 
7 – Remembering Allah often (dhikr)
Al-Harith al-Ash’ari narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah commanded Yahya ibn Zakariyya (peace be upon him) five things to follow and to enjoin upon the Children of Israel… and he commanded them to remember Allah, and the likeness of that is a man who was being pursued by the enemy, until he reached a strong fortress in which he found protection; similarly a man cannot find protection from the shaytan except by remembering Allah…” (al-Tirmidhi) 
8 – The adhan (call to prayer)
Suhayl ibn Abi Salih said: “My father sent me to Bani Harithah, and there was with me a slave of ours, or a companion of ours. Someone called out his name from a garden, and the one who was with me looked into the garden and did not see anything. I mentioned that to my father, and he said, ‘If I had known that this was going to happen to you, I would not have sent you. But if you hear a voice then make the call for prayer, for I heard Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrating that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When the shaytan hears the call to prayer, he runs away fast.”’” (Muslim). 
The word translated here as “runs away fast” may also mean “passes wind.” 
9 – Reciting Quran offers protection against the shaytan 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And when you (Muhammad) recite the Quran, We put between you and those who believe not in the Hereafter, an invisible veil (or screen their hearts, so they hear or understand it not) [Al-Isra’ 17:45]
And Allah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
10516,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10516,How should a man’s hair be cut?,I have a question does a muslim man have to cut his hair a specific way for example does all his hair have to be one lentgh?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem was asked about that and he said: 
With regard to hair, the Prophet’s guidance is either to leave it all alone or to remove all of it. He did not shave part of it and leave part of it. 
What some Muslims do, which is to shave part of the head and leave part, is the qaza’ (tuft) which was forbidden by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). This may take several forms: 
1-Shaving some parts of the head and leaving others
2-Shaving the sides of the head and leaving the middle
3-Shaving the middle and leaving the sides
4-Shaving the front and leaving the back
5-Shaving the back and leaving the front
6-Shaving one side and leaving the other
The fact that these types are haraam is indicated by the report in al-Saheehayn from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said, “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade qaza’, i.e., shaving parts of a boy’s hair and leaving other parts.” And it was narrated from him (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saw a boy who had some of his hair shaved and some left; he forbade them from doing that and said: “Shave it all or leave it all.” And it was narrated from ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) in a marfoo’ report (i.e., attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)): “Shaving the back of the head, unless it is for the purpose of cupping, is the act of the Magians.” In Sunan Abi Dawood it is narrated that Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) saw a boy with his head shaved, leaving two braids or long locks, and he said, “Shave these or cut them, for this is the style of the Jews.” Al-Marwadhi said, “I asked Abu ‘Abd-Allaah (i.e., Ahmad ibn Hanbal) about shaving the back of the head, and he said, “That is what the Magians do, and whoever imitates a people is one of them.”","Fataawa al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah, 2/510"
10518,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10518,Ruling on seeking the help of the jinn,"Some people, when they want to pray against a person, say, “O jinn, seize him, O ‘ifreet seize him; may seven (jinn) seize you, may they break your back and suck your blood.” What is the ruling on such words?",,,"Praise be to Allah.This 
          is shirk, and is a type of seeking the help of the jinn. Some people 
          do this because they have fear of the jinn in their hearts and they 
          are afraid of their power, and because their hearts are devoid of sincere 
          faith and trust in Allaah. So they are content with these illusions 
          and they seek the help of created beings which are not able to bring 
          benefit or ward off harm for themselves, let alone for anyone else.
 When Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have 
          mercy on him) was asked about this matter, he said:
“This is even more abhorrent than associating others in worship with 
          Allaah. We must not do this, we must beware of it, we must advise others 
          not to do it and we must denounce those who do it. If a person is known 
          to commit such actions of shirk, it is not permissible to let him marry 
          a Muslim woman, to eat meat slaughtered by him, to pray over him [the 
          funeral prayer] or to pray behind him, until he announces his repentance 
          to Allaah, which includes devoting his du’aa’ and worship sincerely 
          and purely to Allaah alone.”
(Iqaamat al-Baraaheen ‘ala Hukm 
          man istaghaatha bi ghayr Allaah, p. 30)
 The Standing Committee for Academic Research and 
          Issuing Fatwas has issued a fatwa stating that:
“seeking the help of the jinn and turning to them to meet one’s needs 
          by harming someone or benefitting him is shirk, because it is a kind 
          of worship directed to someone other than Allaah. It is a kind of benefitting 
          from the jinn to fulfil one’s needs, in return for which the jinn benefits 
          by having the human’s veneration and trust, and being called upon by 
          him to fulfil his desires. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
‘And 
          on the Day when He will gather them (all) together (and say): “O you 
          assembly of jinn! Many did you mislead of men,” and their Awliyaa’ (friends 
          and helpers) amongst men will say: “Our Lord! We benefited one from 
          the other, but now we have reached our appointed term which You did 
          appoint for us.” He will say: “The Fire be your dwelling place, you 
          will dwell therein forever, except 
          as Allaah may will. Certainly your Lord is All-Wise, All-Knowing.” 
          
And thus We do make the Zaalimoon 
          (polytheists and wrongdoers) Awliyaa’ (supporters and helpers) of one 
          another (in committing crimes), because of that which they used to earn’ 
          [al-An’aam 6:128-129] 
And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
‘And 
          verily, there were men among mankind who took shelter with the males 
          among the jinn, but they (jinn) increased them (mankind) in sin and 
          transgression’ [al-Jinn 72:6] 
When a human seeks the help of the jinn, to cause harm to another 
          or to protect him from the evil of one whose evil he fears, all of this 
          is shirk, and whoever is in this state, his prayer and fasting mean 
          nothing. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“If 
          you join others in worship with Allaah, (then) surely, (all) your deeds 
          will be in vain, and you will certainly be among the losers” [al-Zumar 
          39:65] 
Whoever is known to do such things, cannot be prayed over if he dies, 
          his funeral cannot be attended, and he cannot be buried in the Muslim 
          graveyard.”  
(Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 
          1/407-408) 
 The jaahili (ignorant) nature of their seeking the 
          help of the jinn and putting their trust in them is highlighted in the 
          words of shirk that they utter, such as: 
“By the help of Allaah and you; I am under Allaah’s care and yours; 
          I have no one except Allaah and you; I am Allaah’s slave and yours; 
          I put my trust in Allaah and in you; this is from Allaah and from you; 
          I have Allaah in heaven and you on earth,” etc. 
 Undoubtedly these phrases are expressions of shirk, 
          because they make a created being the rival of the Creator. Exalted 
          be our Lord far above that. 
 They even call upon Jibreel (peace be upon him) and 
          Muhammad  (peace and blessings of 
          Allaah be upon him) instead of Allaah, by uttering words of ignorance 
          such as, “O Jibreel, help me,” and “O Muhammad, intercede for me.” And 
          Allaah is the One Whose help we seek.",Aadaat wa alfaaz tukhaalif Deen Allaah by Dr. Muhammad ibn Sa’eed al-Qahtaani

We 
          say: it is true that there were fabricators and liars who made up words 
          and attributed them to the Messenger of Allaah  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), but the matter is not quite 
          so simple as imagined by those doubters who also spread doubts among 
          others. They are unaware of the facts about how the Muslims took care 
          of the Sunnah. Alongside the fabricators, there were great numbers of 
          narrators who were trustworthy and highly skilled, and a large number 
          of scholars who surrounded the hadeeths of the Messenger of Allaah  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with a strong barrier which 
          was difficult for the liars to penetrate. By means of their vast knowledge 
          and deep insight, these muhaddithoon (scholars of hadeeth) were able 
          to spot the liars and understand their intentions and motives, and they 
          were able to detect everything that was falsely attributed to the Messenger 
          of Allaah  (peace and blessings 
          of Allaah be upon him). These fabricators were not given free rein to 
          do as they wished with the ahaadeeth of the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and they were given no 
          room to penetrate the ranks of trustworthy narrators of ahaadeeth without 
          being detected.
Who 
          else exposed the lies of these kaafirs, heretics and extreme innovators?
Who 
          were the ones who gave us the definition of what is fabricated, the 
          reasons for fabrication, different types of fabrications and the signs 
          by which a fabricated report may be recognized?  Who wrote so many 
          books on this issue?
They 
          are the guardians of Islam, the vicegerents and troops of Allaah on 
          His earth. They are the brilliant scholars of whom Haaroon al-Rasheed 
          spoke when he arrested a heretic and ordered that he be executed. The 
          heretic said, “Why are you executing me?” Haaroon al-Rasheed said, “To 
          rid the people of you.” The heretic said: “O Ameer 
          al-Mu’mineen, what will you do about the thousand ahaadeeth 
          – according to one report, four thousand ahaadeeth – which I have fabricated 
          and spread among you, in which I made what is halaal haraam and what 
          is haraam halaal, of which the Prophet uttered not one letter?” Haaroon 
          al-Rasheed said to him: “What will you do, O enemy of Allaah, about 
          Abu Ishaaq al-Fazaari and ‘Abd-Allaah ibn al-Mubaarak? They will go 
          through them and sift them letter by letter.” (Tadhkirat 
          al-Huffaaz by al-Dhahabi, 1/273; Taareekh 
          al-Khulafaa’ by al-Suyooti, p. 174).
Professor 
          Muhammad Asad said: “The existence of fabricated ahaadeeth cannot be 
          taken to prove that the entire system of hadeeth is not to be trusted, 
          because these fabricated ahaadeeth never deceived the muhadditheen as 
          some European critics claimed, oversimplifying the matter, and as was 
          echoed by some who claim to be Muslims.” (al-Islam ‘ala Muftaraq al-Tareeq, p. 96) 
We will end this 
          discussion by quoting what was said by Imaam Ibn al-Qayyim al-Jawziyyah: 
          Imaam Abu’l-Muzaffar al-Sam’aani said: “If they say: there are too many 
          reports in the hands of the people and they have become confused, we 
          say: no one is confused except those who are ignorant. Those who have 
          knowledge of them (the reports) check them as stringently as those who 
          deal with money check dirhams and dinars. So they single out (and discard) 
          the false reports and keep the good reports. If there happens to be 
          a narrator who made a mistake, this will not go unnoticed by the brilliant 
          scholars of hadeeth. These scholars listed the mistakes made in both 
          the isnaad (chain of narrators) and matn (texts) of  reports; so 
          you can see that for each narrator they made a list of the mistakes 
          that he had made and the letters that he had mispronounced. If the mistakes 
          of the narrators – in both the isnaad and the matn – did not go unchecked, 
          then how could the fabricated ahaadeeth manufactured by the heretics 
          have slipped past those brilliant scholars?  How could people have 
          narrated ahaadeeth from heretics without the scholars noticing? That 
          is the view of some heretics, but no one would say such a thing except 
          one who is ignorant, misguided, an innovator and a liar who wants to 
          undermine the saheeh ahaadeeth and true reports of the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and confuse ignorant people 
          by means of this lie. There is no evidence for rejecting the reports 
          of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace 
          and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that is weaker or more impossible 
          than this. The one who voices this view deserves to be silenced and 
          expelled from the Muslim lands.","Mukhtasar al-Sawaaiq al-Mursalah, 2/561 ,Al-Bayaan magazine, issue #153, p. 26"

The hadith that speaks against singing implies getting paid also. Is singing the adhan by itself forbidden or not?,,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible 
          to sing the adhaan, but this is not like the prohibition of singing 
          itself; it varies between being makrooh or being haraam, unless the 
          meaning is altered, in which case it becomes haraam.  
    Zayn al-Deen al-‘Iraaqi said:  
It is mustahabb to elongate 
          the vowels slightly in the adhaan, but it is makrooh to elongate them 
          too much in the manner of singing, because it was narrated that a man 
          said to Ibn ‘Umar, “I love you for the sake of Allaah,” and he replied, 
          “I hate you for the sake of Allaah, for you overstep the mark in your 
          adhaan.” Hammaad said, he meant singing.  
     Wali al-Deen al-‘Iraaqi said:  
          
Al-Shaashi

          a soft and sad tone, not harsh like the speech of the Bedouins or soft 
          like the voice of one who is dying… The author of al-Haawi said: 
          Overstepping the mark means speaking in an emphatic and exaggerated 
          manner. He said, it is makrooh to make the adhaan like singing because 
          it makes it incomprehensible, and because the salaf did not do that, 
          rather it is something that was innovated after their time.

          singing, whereby it is given a joyful tune like singing until one cannot 
          tell what they are saying in the words of the adhaan, and it is just 
          voices going up and down. This is a repulsive recently-invented bid’ah 
          (innovation) which some governors introduced in a school that they had 
          built, then it spread from there. This adhaan is done in Syria at this 
          time, and it is a vile innovation, because the purpose of the adhaan 
          is to call people to prayer, so the words must be made understandable 
          to the listener – but in this adhaan nothing can be understood, because 
          the words have been changed into something that resembles singing. It 
          was narrated in the hadeeth that the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever innovates 
          something in this matter of ours (i.e., Islam) that is not part of it, 
          will have it rejected.” Imaam Abu Taalib al-Makki (may Allaah have mercy 
          on him) said in his book: one of the things that they have innovated 
          is modulation (varying the tone) in the adhaan, which is a kind of exaggeration 
          and overstepping the mark. One of the muezzins said to Ibn ‘Umar, “I 
          love you for the sake of Allaah,” and he replied, “But I hate you for 
          the sake of Allaah.” He asked, “Why, O Abu ‘Abd al-Rahmaan?” He said, 
          “Because you exaggerate in your adhaan, and you accept payment for it.” 
          Abu Bakr al-Aajurri (may Allaah have mercy on him) used to say, I left 
          Baghdaad and I cannot stay there because of the innovations that they 
          have introduced into everything, even in Qur’aan recitation and the 
          adhaan – meaning that they accepted payment for it and they had introduced 
          modulation (varying the tone or pitch, like singing). (al-Madhkal 
          2/245, 246)  
4. It was said in al-Mudawwanah: 
          it is makrooh to sing in an emotional tone in the adhaan. And 
          it was said in al-Tiraaz that singing in an emotional tone means 
          making the voice go up and down, which stems from the loss of equilibrium 
          which happens when a person experiences extremes of happiness or grief; 
          it is a kind of confusion or panic.  
It was said in al-‘Atbiyah 
          that giving an emotional tone to the adhaan is munkar (to be denounced). 
          Ibn Habeeb said: (it is also makrooh) to give it a grieving tone without 
          singing. The letters should not be altered or sung. The Sunnah is to 
          enunciate it clearly in a loud voice.  
Ibn Farhoon said: singing 
          in en emotional tone means making short vowels long and long vowels 
          short. ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar heard a man doing this in his adhaan, and 
          he said, “If ‘Umar were alive, he would break your jaw!” Ibn Maaji said, 
          Singing the adhaan in an emotional tone is makrooh, because it goes 
          against humility and dignity, and takes the pattern of singing. The 
          degree to which it is makrooh depends on the type, if it does not reach 
          the level of promiscuous singing; if it does reach that level, then 
          it is haraam. Ibn Habeeb made a connection between a sad tone and a 
          joyful tone, as narrated by Abu Muhammad.  
From this it may be 
          understood that it is mustahabb for the muezzin to have a pleasant and 
          loud voice, and for his voice to resonate. It is makrooh for him to 
          have a harsh and unpleasant voice, and to give the adhaan a joyful or 
          a sad tone; if that reaches extreme levels, then it is haraam.  
          
(Mawaahib al-Jaleel 
          by Hattaab, 1/437, 438)  
Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem (may Allaah have mercy 
          on him) said:  
One should not elongate 
          excessively in the adhaan, and if doing so distorts the meaning, then 
          it invalidates the adhaan. If the elongated letters (huroof al-madd) 
          are made longer than necessary, this should not be done, and if regular 
          vowels are elongated in a manner that changes the meaning, this invalidates 
          the adhaan, otherwise it is makrooh.  
(Fataawa al-Shaykh 
          Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem, 2/125)  
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
          said:  
The mulahhan or the 
          one who introduces modulation into the adhaan is the one who gives the 
          adhaan in the manner of singing, as if he is singing the words of a 
          song. His adhaan is valid but it is makrooh.  
The malhoon is the 
          one who makes grammatical mistakes, i.e., he goes against the rules 
          of the Arabic language. But this falls into two categories, those which 
          invalidate the adhaan, which are those which alter the meaning, and 
          those with which the adhaan is still valid, but it is makrooh, which 
          do not alter the meaning. So if the muezzin says “Allaahu akbaar”, 
          the adhaan is not valid, because he is changing the meaning. Akbaar 
          is the plural of kabar, just as asbaab is the plural of 
          sabab. Kabar is a kind of drum  (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’,

10525,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10525,Reducing the mahr is the Sunnah,"I noticed that people nowadays are increasing the mahr (dowry) for marriage a great deal. 
Is this Sunnah? Does sharee’ah stipulate a certain limit for the mahr that should not be overstepped?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Marriage is one of the blessings of Allah, and one of His signs. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And among His Signs is this, that He created for you wives from among yourselves, that you may find repose in them, and He has put between you affection and mercy. Verily, in that are indeed signs for a people who reflect” [al-Room 30:21] 
Allah commanded guardians to arrange marriages for those who are under their care, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And marry those among you who are single (i.e. a man who has no wife and the woman who has no husband) and (also marry) the Saalihoon (pious, fit and capable ones) of your (male) slaves and maid-servants (female slaves). If they be poor, Allah will enrich them out of His Bounty. And Allah is All-Sufficient for His creatures’ needs, All-Knowing (about the state of the people)” [al-Noor 24:32] 
That is because of the great interests that are served by marriage, such as increasing the numbers of the ummah, and causing the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to feel proud before the other Prophets, and protecting both husband and wife from falling into haraam… and other great benefits. 
But some guardians (walis) put obstacles in the way of marriage, which prevented those under their care from getting married in many cases.  
That is because they exaggerate concerning the mahr, and demand huge dowries which a young man who wants to get married cannot afford, until marriage becomes something extremely difficult for many of those who want to get married. 
The mahr is a right that is given to the woman, as enjoined by Islamic sharee’ah, as an expression of the man’s desire to marry her. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And give to the women (whom you marry) their Mahr (obligatory bridal-money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage) with a good heart” [al-Nisa’ 4:4] 
This does not mean that the woman is a product to be sold, rather it is a symbol of honour and respect, and a sign that the husband is willing to shoulder his responsibilities and fulfil his duties. 
Sharee’ah does not stipulate a certain limit for the mahr that should not be overstepped, but it does encourage reducing the mahr and keeping it simple. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of marriage is that which is made easiest.” Narrated by Ibn Hibbaan, classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 3300. 
And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of mahrs is the simplest (or most affordable).” Narrated by al-Haakim and al-Bayhaqi, classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 3279. 
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to a man who wanted to get married: “Look (for something to give as a dowry), even if it is a ring of iron.” Agreed upon. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) set the highest example for his ummah in that regard, so that a clear understanding of the basic principles would be implanted in society, and a spirit of simplicity would spread among the people. 
Abu Dawood (2125) and al-Nasaa’i (3375) narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas that ‘Ali said: “I married Faatimah (may Allah be pleased with her) and said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, let me go ahead with the marriage.’ He said: ‘Give her something.’ I said: ‘I do not have anything.’ He said: ‘Where is your Hutami shield?’ I said, ‘I have it with me.’ He said, ‘Give it to her.’” Classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Nasaa’i, 3160. 
This was the mahr of Faatimah, the daughter of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), the leader of the women of Paradise. 
This reinforces the fact that in Islam, the mahr is not something that is sought for its own sake. 
Ibn Maajah (1887) narrated that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab said: “Do not go to extremes with regard to the dowries of women, for if that were a sign of honour and dignity in this world or a sign of piety before Allah, then Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would have done that before you. But he did not give any of his wives, and none of his daughters were given, more than twelve uqiyah. A man may increase the dowry until he feels resentment against her and says, ‘You cost me everything I own, and caused me a great deal of hardship’.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah, 1532. 
“Do not go to extremes” means do not exaggerate in increasing the dowry. “A man may increase the dowry until he feels resentment against her” means, until he begins to hate her when he is still paying off the debts incurred because of this mahr because it is too hard for him, or whenever he thinks about the matter.  
From Haashiyat al-Sindi ‘ala Ibn Maajah. 
Twelve uqiyah is equivalent to 480 dirhams, i.e., approximately 135 silver riyals (134.4). This was the mahr of the daughters and wives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah] said in Majmoo’ al-Fatawa, 32/194: 
Whoever thinks of increasing his daughter’s mahr and asking for more than the daughters of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) were given – when they were the best women in this world in all aspects – is an ignorant fool. The same applies to asking for more than the Mothers of the Believers were given. This applies even if one is well off and can afford it. With regard to one who is poor, he should not give a mahr greater than he can afford to pay without any hardship. 
He also said in al-Fatawa al-Kubra: 
The words of Imam Ahmad according to the report of Hanbal imply that it is mustahabb for the dowry to be four hundred dirhams. This is the correct view in cases where the man can afford it. It is mustahabb to pay this amount and no more. 
In Zaad al-Ma’aad (5/178), Ibn al-Qayyim quoted some of the ahaadeeth that indicate that the mahr should be reduced and that there is no minimum amount. Then he said: 
These ahaadeeth indicate that there is no minimum amount for the mahr… and that exaggerating concerning the mahr is makrooh, and that it reduces its barakah (blessing). End quote. 
Hence it is clear that what people do nowadays, increasing the mahr and exaggerating concerning it, is something that goes against the sharee’ah. 
The wisdom behind reducing the mahr and not increasing it is quote clear: 
This makes it easier for people to get married, so that they will not be diverted from it, which will result in all kinds of moral and social corruption.

10527,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10527,Giving zakaah to those who are called Syed (Sayyid),"is there any truth about, you can't give money,zakat or anything to Syed?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
The idea that there 
          are “sayyids” or “walis” (“saints”) whom Allaah has singled out from 
          among mankind for some favour, or that they have a status which other 
          people do not share, is an idea which is based on the Magian belief 
          that Allaah is “incarnated” in people He chooses from among mankind. 
          The Persians used to believe this of their kings (Chosroes) , and that 
          this spirit moved from one king to another, through his descendents. 
          This Magian (Zoroastrian) idea spread to the Muslims via the Raafidi 
          Shi’ah, whose origins are Magian – so this idea was introduced to the 
          Muslims. This idea says that Allaah selects some of mankind, to the 
          exclusion of others, for this status, which is the status of imaamah 
          and wilaayah. So they believe in this idea with regard to  
          ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib and his descendents, and they add other positions 
          to that, such as sayyid and aayah. This idea also spread 
          to some misguided Sufi groups, such as the notion of abdaal and 
          qutb. They said that as this sayyid or wali has 
          this position and status, then they know better what is in our best 
          interests, so we should entrust our affairs to them, because they are 
          better than us, and so they are more entitled to take the zakaah. 
          There can be no doubt that this is obviously a misguided notion.  
          
The truth which Allaah and His Messenger have explained 
          is that the zakaah must be given to those whom Allaah mentioned in His 
          Book, when He said (interpretation of the meaning):  
“As-Sadaqaat (here it means Zakaah) are only for the 
          Fuqaraa’ and Al‑Masaakeen (the poor) and those employed to collect 
          (the funds); and to attract the hearts of those who have been inclined 
          (towards Islam); and to free the captives; and for those in debt; and 
          for Allaah’s Cause (i.e. for Mujaahideen — those fighting in a holy 
          battle), and for the wayfarer (a traveller who is cut off from everything); 
          a duty imposed by Allaah. And Allaah is All-Knower, All-Wise”[al-Tawbah 
          9:60]
According to the Hanbali madhhab, it is 
          better for the Muslim to handle the distribution of his zakaah himself, 
          giving it to the poor whom he knows in his own country. If he cannot 
          do that, then he should give it to a righteous and trustworthy man whose 
          religious commitment he trusts, so that he may deliver it to the poor 
          and needy – not as these people do who take it for their own personal 
          use. 
 By giving zakaah to these so-called sayyids, one 
          is helping them to support their sect. So it is not permissible, according 
          to sharee’ah, to give them zakaah even if they ask for it, because they 
          are following in the footsteps of the Jews and Christians who came before 
          them, of whom Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Verily, there are many 
          of the (Jewish) rabbis and the (Christian) monks who devour the wealth 
          of mankind in falsehood, and hinder (them) from the way of Allaah (i.e. 
          Allaah’s religion of Islamic Monotheism)…”

“Say (O Muhammad): ‘I find not in that which has been revealed to me anything forbidden to be eaten by one who wishes to eat it, unless it be Maitah (a dead animal) or blood poured forth (by slaughtering or the like), or the flesh of swine (pork); for that surely, is impure…”[al-An’aam 6:145]
Its meat is a disease, and the more people advance in knowledge, the more new diseases they discover, because of pork consumption.  
Muslims should keep away from places where this filthy meat is eaten so that they will not eat anything of it without realizing. 
With regard to washing plates, it is sufficient to wash them well with whatever will get rid of the filth of this meat. 
 
Because the correct view is that the impurity caused by pork is like any other impurity; there is no need to wash it seven times, one of which should be with earth.

Ibn al-Qayyim said: Treating disease with haraam things

          With regard to the sharee’ah, this is because of the hadeeth quoted 
          above. With regard to common sense, it is because Allaah has forbidden 
          it because of its abhorrent nature. He would not forbid anything good 
          to this ummah as a punishment, as he forbade things to the Children 
          of Israel when He said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“For the wrongdoing of the Jews, We made unlawful for them certain 
          good foods which had been lawful for them” [al-Nisaa’ 4:160] 
Rather, Allaah has forbidden 
          what He has forbidden for this ummah because it is bad, and He has forbidden 
          it as a protection for them. So it is not right to use it for healing 
          disease and sickness. Even if it has some effect in removing the sickness, 
          it will be followed by an even greater poison in the heart, because 
          of the strength of the evil contained in it. Using it as medicine leads

Secondly: make a final end to your relationship with this woman and with any other women with whom you have a relationship, because most of these relationships end up in committing zinaa which is haraam, or some other kind of physical relationship which is haraam – we seek refuge with Allaah – even if at the beginning it was, as you say, a chaste relationship. For the Shaytaan flows through the son of Adam like his blood. Know that being alone with a non-mahram woman can never be described as a chaste relationship. 
Now you must hasten to repent to Allaah sincerely, by regretting what has happened in the past, giving up this relationship and sincerely resolving never to have any haraam relationship again. This evil woman is trying to make you imagine and to convince you that you committed an immoral action with her so that she may use that as a means to make you commit immoral actions with her again. Even if what she claims were true, that you committed a haraam action with her, do not let the Shaytaan make the most of this opportunity or make you despair of the mercy of Allaah, so that he can mislead you further by making you feel that doing this again and persisting in it is not a serious matter, or make you think that repentance is too difficult. The Shaytaan is eager to make you feel this way, but the mercy of Allaah is vast, so hasten to repent. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):

Do a lot of righteous deeds, prayer and seeking forgiveness. Look for good, religiously-committed friends who will offer you an alternative to these haraam relationships. Know that the gate of repentance is open until the sun rises from the west, and that Allaah accepts the repentance of His slave until the death rattle sounds in the throat. 
Finally, you must hasten to take the means prescribed in sharee’ah to protect yourself – by Allaah’s leave – i.e., marriage, which will keep you from falling into haraam,.

10534,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10534,His parents are insisting that he makes his clothes long (isbaal),I have heard and read a lot of hadeeth on wearing pants above the ankle. i do stick to this sunnah but what if your parents do not want you to do that.they get very angry at me and since that is also a very big sin (making parents angry) i get confused.Please tell me what decision should i take and keep in mind that later on when i inshallah do a job this dress up could affect my job oppurtunities as well.Also tell me when i should be listening to parents or following a sunnah because i find myself in similiar circumstances all the time.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly:  
          
Isbaal 
          means letting the clothes hang down below the ankles, which is haraam, 
          because the Prophet  (peace and 
          blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whatever of the izaar 
          (lower garment) hangs down below the ankles is in the Fire.” (Narrated 
          by al-Bukhaari, 5787)
If 
          someone were to say, “I do not let my garment (or pants) hang down below 
          the ankle out of pride, but because of habit or custom,” 
Our 
          response is: 
That 
          isbaal (letting the clothes hang down below the ankle) in and of itself 
          is subject to the punishment of Fire. If pride and showing off are added 
          to that isbaal, then the punishment is worse and more severe. The Prophet 
           (peace and blessings of Allaah 
          be upon him) said: “Isbaal may apply to the lower garment, shirt or 
          turban. Whoever lets any part of them hang down in order to show off, 
          Allaah will not look at him on the Day of Resurrection.” (Narrated by 
          Abu Dawood, 4085, and al-Nasaa’i, 5334, with a saheeh isnaad).
Secondly: 
          
If 
          you know the ruling on isbaal and that it is haraam, then you and every 
          Muslim must keep away from haraam things, especially major sins. It 
          is not permissible to do something haraam in order to please people, 
          not even one of your parents, because the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no obedience 
          in disobeying Allaah; obedience is only with regard to what is right 
          and proper.” (Narrated by al-Nasaa’i and Abu Dawood, and classed as 
          saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan al-Nasaa’i, no. 3921; al-Silsilah 
          al-Saheehah, 181). Remember what the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever seeks to 
          please Allaah by angering people, Allaah will suffice to protect him 
          from people, but whoever seeks to please people by angering Allaah, 
          Allaah will abandon him to the people.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi in 
          Kitaab al-Zuhd, no. 2338).
With 
          regard to your fear that you may lose your job, know that provision 
          is in the hand of Allaah and no soul will die until it has received 
          all its allotted provision.  
Remember 
          the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning):  
“And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps 
          his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty).
And 
          He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever 
          puts his trust in Allaah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allaah will 
          accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allaah has set a measure for all things” 
          
[al-Talaaq 
          65:2-3]
This 
          fear does not allow you to commit a sin.  
If 
          someone were to ask, if I am forced to do something that is haraam, 
          am I allowed to do it? 
The 
          answer is: 
You 
          have to make sure that one really is being forced. If the matter reaches 
          the level of compulsion, and a person is compelled to do something, 
          then it is permitted for him to do whatever he is forced to do out of 
          necessity.
For 
          example, if a father tells his son that if he makes his clothes come 
          above the ankle, he will kick him out of the house, and the son cannot 
          find anywhere else to live, and he is certain or thinks it most likely 
          that his father will carry out his threat, then he is permitted to make 
          his clothes longer until Allaah gives him a way out.  
Thirdly:  
          
With 
          regard to your saying, “I do stick to this sunnah”, you should note 
          that making the clothes above the ankle is obligatory, it is not only 
          Sunnah. The Sunnah is to make the izaar (lower garment) come 
          to mid-calf, and this Sunnah is optional. If a person wishes, he may 
          do it, and if he wishes, he may not do it. Sunnah, according to the 
          definition of the scholars, is “That for which the one who does it will 
          be rewarded and the one who does not do it will not be punished.”  
          
Note 
          that what is to be worn at mid-calf length is the izaar (lower 
          garment). The thobe (galabiyah) is not to be worn in this 
          manner; rather the Sunnah in the case of the thobe is to wear 
          it below mid-calf and above the ankles. The same applies to pants, which 
          should be worn above the ankle because the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The ankles have no 
          right to the izaar.” (Narrated by al-Nasaa’i in Kitaab al-Zeenah, 
          no. 3529; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan al-Nasaa’i, 
          no. 4922)

The idea is for a charitable organization to issue special cards which will enable the bearer to get special discounts of 15% or 20% or more from various stores, based on an agreement between the charity and the owners of these stores. The charity will charge special fees to be paid by those who will benefit from these cards, which is to offset the costs incurred by the club for employing people to contact the stores and draw up the agreements with the business owners, in addition to buying the machinery for producing the cards and the price of the cards themselves, renting office space, paying employees to receive those who come to buy these cards, paying for advertising, and other expenses, etc.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Producing these cards is not permissible, based on what 
          you have said. That is because the fee paid by those who will benefit 
          from them will cause great harm to those who have no great need to buy 
          those things from those stores. He may think that what he needs is too 
          little, and it will be too much trouble for him to go to those particular 
          stores. A year will go by without him having benefited from this card, 
          or having covered the annual fee that he paid. This is like the way 
          in which insurance companies operate. It will also have an adverse effect 
          on the other stores which do not have an agreement with you. People, 
          or most of them, will turn away from them and will go and buy from the 
          stores with which you have an agreement to refer the people who buy 
          the cards to them. It is haraam to cause harm to a fellow-Muslim. Hence 
          we say that it is not allowed to deal in the cards which some companies 
          make and which are a form of deception on the part of these particular 
          stores, which give this discount to those who have these cards, but 
          the discount they give is no more than the amount by which they raised 
          their price over the price charged in other stores. So they make the 
          person who has this card think that he has gotten a discount, when this 
          is not really the case. And Allaah knows best.","Kitaab al-Fataawa al-Jibreeniyyah by Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Jibreen, p. 23"

Ruling on wearing amulets for protection","Praise be to Allah.Hadiths on amulets 
Firstly, we could not find the hadiths whose soundness the questioner asked about, because we do not know the text of those hadiths. He said that they were in volume 50 of al-Muwatta, but al-Muwatta is only one volume. 
Hence we will quote what we are able to of the hadiths that have been narrated on amulets, and we will explain – in sha Allah – the rulings of the scholars on them. Hopefully some of this will be what the questioner is looking for. 

It was narrated from ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ud that the Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: 

“The Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) disliked ten things: Yellow colouring, meaning khaloouq (a perfume made from saffron), dyeing gray hair, trailing the lower garment, wearing a gold ring, throwing dice, a woman adorning herself before people who are not her mahrams, using spells (ruqyah) except with the Mu'awwidhatan, wearing amulets , coitus interruptus, and having intercourse with a woman who is breastfeeding a child; but he did not declare them to be prohibited.”  (Narrated by al-Nasai, 50880; Abu Dawud, 4222) 
“Having intercourse with a woman who is breastfeeding a child” means, if she becomes pregnant this will harm the child who is breastfeeding. 
This hadith was classed as da’if (weak) by al-Albani in Da’if al-Nasai, 3075) 

It was narrated from Zaynab the wife of ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ud from ‘Abd-Allah that he said: 

“I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say, ‘Spells (ruqyah), amulets and love-charms are shirk .” I said, “Why do you say this? By Allah, my eye was weeping with a discharge and I kept going to So and So, the Jew, who did a spell for me. When he did the spell, it calmed down.” ‘Abd-Allah said: “That was just the work of the Shaytan who was picking it with his hand, and when (the Jew) uttered the spell, he stopped. All you needed to do was to say as the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say: ‘Adhhib il-bas Rabb al-nas ishfi anta al-Shafi la shifa-a illa shifa-uka shifa-an la yughadiru saqaman (Remove the harm, O Lord of mankind, and heal, You are the Healer. There is no healing but Your healing, a healing which leaves no disease behind.’”  (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 3883; Ibn Mauajah, 3530) 
This hadith was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Silsilat al-Saheehah, 331 and 2972. 

It was narrated that ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Amir said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “Whoever wears an amulet, may Allah not fulfil his need, and whoever wears a sea-shell, may Allah not give him peace.”  (Narrated by Ahmad, 16951) 

This hadith was classed as da’if by Shaykh al-Albani in Da’if al-Jami’, 5703. 

It was narrated from ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Amir al-Juhani that a group came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) [to swear their allegiance (bay’ah) to him]. He accepted the bay’ah of nine of them but not of one of them. They said, “O Messenger of Allah, you accepted the bay’ah of nine but not of this one.” He said, “He is wearing an amulet.” The man put his hand (in his shirt) and took it off, then he (the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)) accepted his bay’ah. He said, ‘Whoever wears an amulet has committed shirk.” (Narrated by Ahmad, 16969) 

This hadith was classed as sahih by Shaykh al-Albani in al-Silsilah al-Sahihah, 492.  
Ruling on wearing amulets for protection
Amulets (tamimah, pl. tamaim) are things made from pearls or bones that are worn on the necks of children or adults, or are hung up in houses or cars, in order to ward off evil – especially the evil eye – or to bring some benefits. 
These are the comments of the scholars on the various kinds of amulets and the rulings on each kind. These comments contain important and useful points. 

Shaykh Sulayman ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhab said: 

“Know that the scholars among the Sahabah and Tabi’in and those who came after them differed as to whether it is permissible to hang up amulets which only contain words from the Quran or names and attributes of Allah. 
One group said that this is permissible. This was the view of ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘As and others. This is the apparent meaning of the report narrated from `Aishah and it was the view of Abu Ja’far al-Baqir and Ahmad, according to one report. They interpreted the hadith as referring to amulets which involve shirk; with regard to those which contain words from the Quran or the names and attributes of Allah, then they are like ruqyah which uses the same words. 
I say, this appears to be the view of Ibn al-Qayyim. 
Another group said that this is not permissible. This was the view of Ibn Mas’ud and Ibn 'Abbas, and is the apparent meaning of the view of Hudhayfah, ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Amir and Ibn ‘Akim (may Allah be pleased with him). This was also the view of a group of the Tabi’in, including the companions of Ibn Mas’ud and Ahmad, according to one report which was chosen by most of his companions. It was also the view of the later scholars, who quoted this and similar ahadith as evidence. The apparent meaning is that it is general in application and does not differentiate between amulets which contain Quran and amulets which contain other things, unlike ruqyah where there is a differentiation. This is supported by the fact that the Sahabah who narrated the hadith understood it to be general in meaning, as was quoted above from Ibn Mas’ud. 
Abu Dawud narrated that ‘Isa ibn Hamzah said: “I entered upon ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Akim and his face was red due to high fever. I said, ‘Why don’t you hang up an amulet?’ He said, ‘We seek refuge with Allah from that. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever hangs up anything will be entrusted to its care…”’” 
This scholarly difference was concerning hanging up amulets which contain Quran or names and attributes of Allah, so what do you think about the things which were innovated later on, doing spells (ruqyah) using the names of shayatin (devils) and others and hanging them up, and even being attached to those shayatin, seeking refuge in them, slaughtering animals for them, asking them to ward off harm and bring benefits – actions which are pure shirk? This is prevalent among many of the people, except for those whom Allah keeps safe and sound. Think about what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said and what was the practice of the Sahabah and Tabi’in, and what the scholars after them mentioned on this topic and others. Then look at what happened in the later generations. It will become clear to you what the religion of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is, and how it has now become alienated in all ways. And Allah is the One Whose help we seek. (Taysir al-‘Aziz al-Hamid, p. 136-138) 

Shaykh Hafiz Hakami said: 

“If they – i.e., amulets – contain clearly-written Quranic verses or sahih ahadith, there was some dispute among the salaf – the Sahabah, the Tabi’in and those who followed them – as to whether they are permissible. 
Some of them – i.e., some of the Salaf – said that this was permissible. This was narrated from ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her), Abu Ja’far Muhammad ibn ‘Ali, and others among the salaf. 
Some of them said that this was not allowed; they regarded it is makruh and not permitted. They include ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Akim, ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr, ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Amir, and ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ud and his companions such as al-Aswad and ‘Alqamah, and those who came after them such as Ibrahim al-Nakha’i and others – may Allah have mercy on them. 
Undoubtedly not allowing that is a safer precaution to prevent means that lead to wrong beliefs, especially in our own times. If most of the Sahabah and Tabi’in regarded it as makruh in those noble times when the faith in their hearts was greater than a mountain, then regarding it as makruh in these times of trials and tribulations is more appropriate and is more on the safe side. So how about when this concession has led people to things which are purely haram and they have made it a means to those things? For example, they make amulets for seeking refuge, on which they write an ayah or surah or the phrase “Bismillah ir-Rahman ir-Rahim (In the name of Allah, the most Gracious, the Most Merciful), then underneath it they put some devilish mumbo-jumbo, the meaning of which no one knows except one who has read their books. Or they divert the hearts of the common folk from putting their trust in Allah and make them dependent on the things that they have written, and most of them frighten the people, before anything even happens to them. One of them will come to the person whom he wants to trick out of his money, knowing that the person is relying on him and trusts him, and he says: “Such and such is going to happen to your family or your wealth or to you,” Or he says, “You have a qarin (constant companion) from among the jinn,” or the like, and he describes things to him and and tells him things about himself that the Shaytaan whispers to him, to make him think that he has true insight and that he cares about him and wants to bring him some benefit. When the heart of the ignorant fool is filled with fear of what has been described to him, he turns away from his Lord and turns to this charlatan with all his heart and soul; he puts his trust in him and relies on him instead of Allah, and says to him, “What is the way out from the things that you have described? What is the means of warding them off?” It is as if he (the charlatan) has control over benefit and harm, at which point his hopes are raised and he becomes more greedy, wondering how much he will be able to take. So he tells him, “If you give me such and such, I will write an amulet for that which will be this long and this wide” – he describes it and speaks to him in a nice manner. Then he hangs up this amulet to protect him from such and such diseases. Do you think, after all that we have mentioned, that this belief is a form of minor shirk? No way; it means that one is taking as one’s god someone other than Allah, putting one's trust in someone other than Him, turning to someone other than Him, relying on the deeds of created beings and trying to divert people from their religion. Can the Shaytan do any of these tricks except with the help of his devilish brethren among mankind? 
“Say: ‘Who can guard and protect you in the night or in the day from the (punishment of the) Most Gracious (Allah)?’ Nay, but they turn away from the remembrance of their Lord” [al-Anbiya 21:42 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Then along with the devilish mumbo-jumbo, he writes on the amulet something from the Quran , and hangs it up when he is not tahir (in a state of purity), when he is in a state of minor or major impurity, and he never shows any respect towards it or keeps it away from other things. By Allah, none of the enemies of Allah have treated His Book with as much contempt as these heretics who claim to be Muslims. By Allah, the Quran was revealed to be recited and followed, for its commandments to be obeyed and its prohibitions heeded, for its information to be believed and its limits to be adhered to, for its parables and stories to serve as lessons, and for it to be believed in.
“… the whole of it (clear and unclear Verses) are from our Lord…” [Al ‘Imran 3:7 – interpretation of the meaning] 
But these people have ignored all of that and cast it behind their backs; they have merely memorized a few words in order to earn their living from them, like any other means of earning a living that enables them to do haram things, not things which are permitted. If a king or a governor wrote a letter to his subordinate, telling him to do such and such and not to do such and such, commanding the people in your city to do such and such and forbidding them to do such and such, etc., and he took that letter and did not read it or think about its instructions, and he did not convey that to those to whom he was commanded to convey it, but instead he took it and hung it around his neck or his arm, and did not pay any attention at all to what was in it, the king would punish him severely for that. So how about that which was revealed from the Compeller of the heavens and the earth, Who has the highest description in the heavens and on earth, to Whom is all praise in the beginning and at the end, to Whom all things return, so worship Him and put your trust in Him, He is sufficient for me, there is no god but He, in Him I put my trust and He is the Lord of the Mighty Throne. And if they (amulets) contain anything but the two revelations (i.e., Quran and sahih Sunnah) then this is shirk without a doubt, and is more akin to the azlam (arrows used during the jahiliyyah for seeking luck or help in decision making) in being far-removed from the characteristics of Islam. 
If they (amulets) contain anything other than the two revelations and instead contain mumbo-jumbo from the Jews or worshippers of the temple, stars or angels, or those who use the services of the jinn, etc., or they are made of pearls, strings, iron rings, etc., then this is shirk, i.e., hanging them up or wearing them is shirk, beyond a doubt, because they are not among the permissible means or known forms of treating disease. It is simply a belief that they will ward off such and such a problem or pain because of their so-called special features. This is like the belief of idol-worshippers concerning their idols, and they are like the azlam (arrows) which the people of the jahiliyyah used to take everywhere with them and consult whenever they had to make a decision. These were three arrows, on the first of which was written ‘Do’, on the second ‘Do not do’ and on the third ‘Try again.’ If the person picked out the one which said ‘Do’, he would go ahead and do that thing; if it said, ‘Do not do’, he would not do it, and if it said, ‘Try again,’ he would consult them again. Instead of this, Allah – to Whom be praise – has given us something better, which is the prayer of Istikharah. 
In conclusion, these amulets which do not contain Quran or Sunnah are just like the azlam in that they involve corrupt beliefs and go against the shari’ah and are far-removed from the characteristics of Islam. Those who believe in pure Tawhid keep as far away as possible from such things. The faith in their hearts is too great to permit anything of this sort to enter their hearts. Their status is too high and their certainty of faith is too strong for them to put their trust in anyone other than Allah or to seek the protection of anyone other than Him. And Allah is the Source of strength.” (Ma’arij al-Qabul, 2/510-512) 
The view that amulets are not allowed even if they contain words from the Quran is the view of our shaykhs: 

The scholars of the Standing Committee said: 

“The scholars agreed that it is haram to wear amulets if they contain anything other than Quran, but they differed concerning those which do contain Quran. Some of them said that wearing these is permitted, and others said that it is not permitted. The view that it is not permitted is more likely to be correct because of the general meaning of the ahadith, and in order to prevent means of shirk.” (Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz, Shaykh ‘Abd-Allah ibn Ghadyan, Shaykh ‘Abd-Allah ibn Qa’ud.  Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 1/212) 

Shaykh al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:

“This misguidance is still widespread among the Bedouin, fallahin (peasants) and some of the city-dwellers. Examples include the pearls which some drivers put in their cars, hanging them from the rear-view mirror. Some of them hang an old shoe on the front or back of the car; some hang a horse-shoe on the front of their house or shop. All of that is to ward off the evil eye, or so they claim. And there are other things which are widespread because of ignorance of Tawhid and the things which nullify it such as actions of shirk and idolatry which the messengers were only sent and the Books were only revealed to put an end to. It is to Allah that we complain of the ignorance of Muslims nowadays, and their being far away from their religion.” ((Silsilat al-Ahadith al-Sahihah, 1/890, 492)

10547,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10547,Torment and Blessing in the Grave,"I have a strange question. My Aqeedah is that after the body is dead, it is of no use and they cannot hear, but according to a Hadith, there is punishment in the grave. Does this mean that the body is still alive? Also in the quran it is mentioned that martyrs don't die? It is reported in a Hadith in Sahih Muslim that when the Prophet (sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam) addressed the body of Abu Jahl, Imayyah and others, ‘Umar asked him how the dead could hear, to which the Prophet replied that they can hear but cannot reply. Kindly answer my question with detail.","The belief of Ahl As-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah is that there is torment and punishment in the grave and life in Al-barzakh, and there is blessing and pleasure, according to the status of the deceased. According to the most correct scholarly view, the torment of the grave befalls both the soul and the body.","Do dead people hear us?


Is there torment and punishment in the grave?


Interpreting Prophet Muhammad's Address to the Deceased Polytheists at the Battle of Badr


Does the torment of the grave befall both the soul and the body?","Praise be to Allah.Do dead people hear us?
What is mentioned in the question, that the dead do not hear anything which the living say is true and is correct. Allah says (interpretation of the meanings): 
“but you cannot make hear those who are in graves. ” [Fatir 35:22] 
“So verily, you (O Muhammad) cannot make the dead to hear.” [Ar-Rum 30:52]
Is there torment and punishment in the grave?
 The belief of Ahl As-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah is that there is torment and punishment in the grave and life in Al-barzakh (the interval between death and the Day of Resurrection), and there is blessing and pleasure, according to the status of the deceased. 
The evidence for that is the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The Fire, they are exposed to it, morning and afternoon. And on the Day when the Hour will be established (it will be said to the angels): ‘Cause Pharaoh’s people to enter the severest torment!’”[Ghafir 40:46] 
Allah states here that the people of Pharaoh are exposed to torment morning and afternoon even though they are dead. From this verse, the scholars affirmed that the torment of the grave is real. 
Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“This verse is the main basis of the belief of Ahl As-Sunnah in the torment of Al-barzakh , as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The Fire, they are exposed to it, morning and afternoon” [Ghaafir 40:46].” (Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 4/82) 
According to the Hadith of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her), the wife of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to supplicate in his prayer, “Allahumma inni a`udhu bika min `adhab il-qabr, wa a`udhu bika min fitnat il-masih id-dajjal, wa a`udhu bika min fitnat il-mahya wa fitnat il-mamat, Allahumma ini a`udhu bika min Al-ma’tham wal-maghram (O Allah, I seek refuge in You from the torment of the grave, I seek refuge in You from the tribulation of the Dajjal, I seek refuge in You from the trials of life and death, O Allah, I seek refuge in You from sin and loss).” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 798; Muslim, 589) 
The relevant point in this Hadith is that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to seek refuge with Allah from the torment of the grave. This is one of the proofs that confirm the torment of the grave. No one disputed the torment of the grave apart from the Mu`tazilah and some other groups who are not worth paying attention to. 
Interpreting Prophet Muhammad's Address to the Deceased Polytheists at the Battle of Badr
With regard to the Hadith which describes the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) addressing the dead bodies of the polytheists on the day of the battle of Badr, this was a unique case where Allah brought them back to life so that His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) might rebuke them and humiliate them.

It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stood over the well of Badr [into which the bodies of the polytheists had been thrown] and said, ‘Have you found the promise of your Lord to be true?’ Then he said, ‘They can hear what I am saying now.’” (Narrated by Al-Bukhaari, 3980; Muslim, 932) 
It was narrated that Abu Talhah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “ ‘Umar said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, why are you speaking to bodies that have no souls?’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘By the One in Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, you do not hear what I am saying any better than they do.’” Qutadah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Allah brought them back to life so that they could hear what he was saying, so that they might be rebuked and feel regret and shame. (Narrated by Al-Bukhaari, 3976; Muslim, 2875. See Fath Al-Baari, 7/304) 

The relevant point here is that Allah caused the people in the well to hear the words of His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), so that they might be humiliated. Nonetheless, it is not correct to deduce from this Hadith that the dead can hear everything, because this applied only to the people in the well. Some scholars made an exception and said that the dead can hear the greeting of Salam, but this is a view for which clear sound evidence is lacking.
Does the torment of the grave befall both the soul and the body?
According to the most correct scholarly view, the torment of the grave befalls both the soul and the body . 
Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“The view of the earliest generations of this Ummah and its Imams is that the torment or blessing (of the grave) happens to the soul of the deceased and his body. After it departs from the body, the soul continues to be blessed or punished, and it is also connected to the body from time to time, so that the blessing or torment befalls the body as well as the soul. Therefore, we must believe in that which Allah has told us.” (Al-Ikhtiyarat Al-Fiqhiyyah, p. 94) 
Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Shaykh Al-Islam (Ibn Taymiyah) was asked about this matter, and we will quote his reply in full: 
“Indeed, the torment and blessing happen to both the soul and the body, according to the consensus of the Ahl As-Sunnah wal-Jama’ah. The soul is blessed or tormented separately from the body, and it is blessed or tormented in connection with the body. The body is connected to it, so in this case the blessing or torment happens to them both, and it may happen to the soul separately from the body. 
The view of the Salaf and Imams of this Ummah is that when a person dies, he will be in a state of blessing or torment, and that happens to his soul and his body. After the soul has departed from the body, it remains in a state of blessing or torment, and that is sometimes connected to the body and the blessing or torment happens to them both. Then when the Day of Resurrection comes, the souls will be returned to their bodies and they will rise from their graves to meet the Lord of the Worlds. The physical resurrection is a matter upon which the Muslims, Jews and Christians are agreed.”  (Al-Ruh, p. 51, 52) 
The scholars likened that to dreams when one is asleep, for a person may dream that he is going and traveling, and he may feel happiness or grief and sorrow while he is sleeping, and that is when he is in his place and in this world. So it is more apt that things should be different in the life of Al-barzakh which is completely different from the life of this world and the life of the Hereafter. 
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“If it is said, we see the deceased and how he is in his grave, so how can he be questioned, made to sit up and beaten with iron rods, when no mark is left on him? The answer is that this is not impossible, and indeed there is a similar case in our regular lives, that of the sleeper who feels joy or pain of which we feel nothing.  A person who is awake may also feel joy or pain because of something he hears or thinks about, and those who are sitting with him feel nothing of that. Similarly, Jibril used to come to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and tell him of the Revelation, and the people present were unaware of it. All of that is clear and evident.” (Sharh Muslim, 17/201) 
Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“When a person sleeps, he may feel joy or pain, and that happens to his soul and his body. He may dream that someone is beating him and wake up with pain in his body, or he may dream that he is being fed some good food, then wake up with the taste of food in his mouth. This is something that really happens. If the body and soul of a sleeping person can experience joy and pain that are not felt by the person next to him, and a sleeper may even cry out because of the intensity of pain or fear of what is happening to him, and those who are awake can hear him, and he may speak, reciting Quran or dhikr, or talking to someone, and those who are awake can hear that, even though he is asleep with his eyes closed, and he does not hear them if they speak to him – then how can we deny that the one who is buried in his grave also feels things, when the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has told us that he “hears the sound of their footsteps” and “You do not hear what I say any better than they do”? 
The heart is akin to the grave, hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, when he missed ‘Asr on the day of Al-Khandaq: “May Allah fill their hearts and graves with fire.” Moreover, Allah differentiated between them (graves and hearts) in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Knows he not that when the contents of the graves are poured forth (all mankind is resurrected)?
And that which is in the hearts (of men) shall be made known?” [Al-‘Aadiyat 100:9-10]
This is just to explain that this could happen.
We cannot say that the blessing or torment that the dead experience is like that which a sleeper experiences when he dreams, rather that blessing or torment is more complete and more far-reaching; it is a real blessing and a real torment. Yet, this example is given to show that this is possible. If someone were to say that the dead person does not move in his grave, and the soil does not change, and so on, this matter may be explained in more detail, but that would take too long to explain here. And Allah knows best. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.” (Majmu’ Al-Fatawa, 4/275, 276)

10549,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10549,When should the Haji offer his sacrifice?,"If a haji goes for hajj, is it waajib on him to do qurbani At his home place also ?",,,"Praise be to Allah.1 – Hajj is of three types: Ifraad, Tamattu’ and Qiraan. 
Ifraad is when one does Hajj on its own (without ‘Umrah). Tamattu’ means doing ‘Umrah, then exiting the state of ihraam, then doing Hajj. Qiraan means doing Hajj and ‘Umrah together with one ihraam (only entering ihraam once for both), in which one Tawaaf and one Sa’ee is sufficient for both Hajj and ‘Umrah. 
It was narrated from ‘Urwah ibn al-Zubayr that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “We set out with the Messenger of Allah SAWS (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) shortly before the appearance of the new moon of Dhu’l-Hijjah and he said, ‘Whoever wants to assume ihraam for ‘Umrah may do so, and whoever wants to assume ihraam for Hajj may do so. Had I not brought the hadiy (sacrifice) with me, I would have assumed ihraam for ‘Umrah.’ Some of the people assumed ihraam for ‘Umrah and others for Hajj…”
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1694; Muslim, 1211) 
2 – Ifraad means doing Hajj on its own, with no ‘Umrah beforehand. The one who is doing Ifraad does not have to offer a sacrifice, but it is mustahabb (recommended). 
3 – In the case of Tamattu’ and Qiraan, the sacrifice is obligatory. This is the blood of thanksgiving, by which the pilgrim thanks his Lord for prescribing this ritual for him. In Tamattu’ the pilgrim combines ‘Umrah and Hajj, exiting the state of ihraam in between, when he can enjoy (yatamatta’) wearing perfume and regular clothing, and having intercourse. 
It was narrated from Saalim ibn ‘Abd-Allah that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: “During his last Pilgrimage, the Messenger of Allah SAWS (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did ‘Umrah and then Hajj. He drove a Hadiy (sacrificial animal) along with him from Dhu’l-Hulayfah. The Messenger of Allah SAWS (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) started by assuming Ihram for 'Umrah, then for Hajj. And the people, too, assumed ihraam for ‘Umrah then for Hajj
along with the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Some of them brought the Hadiy (sacrificial animals) and drove it along with them, whilst the others did not. So, when the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) reached Makkah, he said to the people, ‘Whoever among you has driven the Hadiy, should not finish his ihraam till he completes his Hajj. And whoever among you has not (driven) the Hadiy with him, should perform Tawaaf of the Ka'bah and the Tawaaf between Safa and Marwa, then cut short his hair and finish his ihraam, then  he should assume ihraam for Hajj. If anyone cannot afford a Hadiy, he should fast for three days during the Hajj and seven days when he returns home.”
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1606, Muslim, 1227) 
4 – The hadiy (sacrifice) is that which the pilgrim gives as a gift (yahdeehi) to the Ancient House. It is one of the “al-an’aam” animals, i.e., sheep, cattle or camels, which he brings with him before entering ihraam. One of the differences between the one who does Tamattu’ and the one who does Qiraan is that the one who does Qiraan does not exit ihraam after finishing his ‘Umrah; he remains in ihraam until the eighth of Dhu’l-Hijjah, which is the day when he enters the intention for Hajj. 
The Sunnah is to slaughter the sacrifice on the day of Eid, which is the tenth of Dhu’l-Hijjah. 
It was narrated from Saalim ibn ‘Abd-Allah that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: “During his last Pilgrimage, the Messenger of Allah SAWS (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) performed ‘Umrah and then Hajj. He drove a Hadiy (sacrificial animal) along with him… then he went to Safa and Marwa and ran between them seven times and did not do any deed forbidden because of Ihraam, until he finished his Hajj and sacrificed his Hadiy on the day of Nahr (the tenth day of Dhul-Hijjah). He then hastened onwards (to Makkah) and performed Tawaaf of the Ka'bah, and then everything that was forbidden because of Ihraam became permissible.”
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1606, Muslim, 1227) 
5 – No one among the pilgrims has to offer a sacrifice in his own country, because the sacrifice is one of the rituals (of Hajj), so it can only be done in Makkah. Even if the pilgrim has to offer a sacrifice because he did something which is not allowed during Hajj, he should not offer this sacrifice in his own country, rather it should be done in Mina or Makkah. 
‘Abd al-‘Azeem Aabaadi said: it is permissible to slaughter all the sacrificial animals in the sacred land (the Haram of Makkah), according to scholarly consensus, but Mina is the best place for offering the sacrifice of Hajj, and Makkah – except for al-Marwah – is the best place for offering the sacrifice of ‘Umrah. 
But if the pilgrim has a family whom he leaves behind in his own country and leaves with them money so that they can buy a sacrificial animal on the day of Eid, this is good.

With regard to the Qur’aan, it is the aayat (interpretation of the meanings):

Duty towards parents includes spending on them according to necessity. 
With regard to ijmaa’ (scholarly consensus), Ibn al-Mundhir said: “The scholars are agreed that spending on poor parents who have no source of income and no money is an obligation on the son’s wealth.” 
The obligation of spending is conditional upon the one who is spending being able to afford to do so, and upon the one on whom money is spent being in difficulty and being in need of that spending. This is according to general consensus.","Al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, vol. 39, p. 22"
10554,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10554,Characteristics of the saved group,What are the most prominent characteristics of the saved group? If a person is lacking in any of these characteristics does that mean that he is not one of the saved group?,,,"Praise be to Allah.The most prominent characteristic of 
          the saved group is adherence to the way of the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in ‘aqeedah (belief), ‘ibaadah 
          (worship), manners and attitude, and dealings with others. The saved 
          group has distinct characteristics in these four areas.   
In matters of ‘aqeedah you will find 
          that they adhere to that which is indicated by the Book of Allaah and 
          the Sunnah of His Messenger  (peace 
          and blessings of Allaah be upon him), i.e., absolute Oneness (Tawheed) 
          of the Divinity and Lordship of Allaah, and of His Names and Attributes. 
            
In matters of worship, you will find 
          that this group is distinguished by its total adherence to and application 
          of that which the Prophet  (peace 
          and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to do with regard to different 
          kinds of acts of worship, how they are done, to what extent, where and 
          when, and for what reasons. You will not find them introducing innovations 
          into the religion of Allaah, rather they show the utmost respect towards 
          Allaah and His Messenger, so they do not put themselves forward before 
          Allaah and His Messenger (cf. al-Hujuraat 49:1) by suggesting 
          any innovated act of worship for which He has not granted permission. 
            
In matters of manners and attitude, you 
          will also find that they differ from others by virtue of their good 
          attitudes such as wishing the Muslims well, being content, having a 
          cheerful countenance, speaking well, being generous, being courageous, 
          and other noble and good characteristics.  
In matters of dealings with others, you will find that 
          they deal with others in an open and sincere manner.  They are 
          the ones to whom the Prophet  (peace 
          and blessings of Allaah be upon him) referred when he said: “The two 
          parties (to a transaction) have the choice (of proceeding with the transaction 
          or cancelling it) until they separate. If they are sincere and open, 
          their transaction will be blessed for them, and if they are lying or 
          deceitful, the blessing will be lost.”   
If a person is lacking in any of these characteristics, 
          then does not mean that he is not one of the saved group, but for all, 
          there will be degrees according to that which they did (cf. al-Ahqaaf 
          46:19). Falling short in matters of Tawheed may put a person outside 
          the saved group, such as lacking in ikhlaas (sincerity or purity 
          of intention). The same applies to bid’ah, as a person may do acts of 
          bid’ah which put him outside the saved group.   
In matters of morals and dealings with others, 
          defects in such matters do not put a person outside this group, although 
          they may reduce him in status.   
We 
          need to look in more detail at the matter of attitude and manners. One 
          of the most important matters of attitude and manners is unity and uniting 
          upon the truth. This is what Allaah urges us to do in the aayah 
          (interpretation of the meaning): 
“He (Allaah) has ordained for you the same religion 
          (Islamic Monotheism) which He ordained for Nooh (Noah), and that which 
          We have revealed to you (O Muhammad), 
          and that which We ordained for Ibraaheem (Abraham), Moosa (Moses) and 
          ‘Eesa (Jesus) saying you should establish religion (i.e. to do what 
          it orders you to do practically) and make no divisions in it (religion) 
          (i.e. various sects in religion)” [al-Shoora 42:13]   
          
Allaah tells us that those who divide their religion 
          and break up into sects, Muhammad  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) has nothing to do with them. 
          Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, those who divide their religion and break 
          up into sects (all kinds of religious sects), you (O Muhammad) have 
          no concern in them in the least” [al-An’aam 6:159]   
          
Unity and harmony are among the most 
          prominent characteristics of the saved sect – Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah. 
          If any dispute arises among them, stemming from ijtihaad in matters 
          where ijtihaad is permitted – they do not bear ill-will, enmity or grudges 
          against one another. Rather they regard one another as brothers even 
          though these differences arise between them. One of them will pray behind 
          another even if he thinks that he does not have wudoo’ whilst the imaam 
          thinks that he does have wudoo’. For example, one of them may pray behind 
          another who has eaten camel meat, and this imaam thinks that this does 
          not break wudoo’ whereas the person praying behind him thinks that it 
          does break wudoo’. So he believes that his prayer behind this imaam 
          is valid, but if he himself were to pray in that state on his own he 
          would think that his prayer is not valid. All this is because they believe 
          that differences which arise from ijtihaad in cases where ijtihaad is 
          allowed, are not really differences, because each of them has followed 
          evidence (daleel) as he is obliged to do, and which should not be ignored. 
          So they believe that if their brother differs from them with regard 
          to some action because he is following the evidence (daleel), then in 
          effect he is agreeing with them, because they advocate following the 
          evidence wherever it is. So although he differs from them, he is still 
          following evidence from the Book of Allaah or the Sunnah of the Messenger 
          of Allaah  (peace and blessings 
          of Allaah be upon him). The scholars are not unaware of the differences 
          of this nature that arose among the Sahaabah even during the time of 
          the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
          of Allaah be upon him), but he did not rebuke them. When he  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came back from the campaign 
          of al-Ahzaab, and Jibreel came to him and told him to go out to Bani 
          Qurayzah, who had broken the treaty, the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told his companions, “None 
          of you should pray ‘Asr until he reaches Bani Qurayzah.” They set out 
          from Madeenah to Bani Qurayzah, and they were worried about missing 
          the ‘Asr prayer. Some of them delayed the ‘Asr prayer until they reached 
          Bani Qurayzah, and they prayed it after the time for the prayer had 
          passed, because the Prophet  (peace 
          and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had said, “None of you should pray 
          ‘Asr until he reaches Bani Qurayzah.” Others prayed ‘Asr on time, saying 
          that all the Prophet  (peace and 
          blessings of Allaah be upon him) had meant was that they should hasten 
          to go out (to Bani Qurayzah); he did not mean that they should delay 
          the prayer. These are the ones who were correct, but the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not rebuke either of 
          the two groups, and neither expressed enmity towards the other. The 
          Muslims who claim to follow the Sunnah should be one ummah and 
          not divide into groups, fighting one another verbally and arguing and 
          hating one another for a matter in which it is allowed to have different 
          opinions. There is no need to mention every group by name; the smart 
          person will understand what I mean.  
I think that Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah 
          should unite even though they differ in the ways in which they understand 
          those texts which may be interpreted in different ways. That is a matter 
          in which there is room for differences, may Allaah be praised. What 
          matters is harmony and unity. No doubt the enemies of Islam want the 
          Muslims to be divided, whether they are enemies who express their enmity 
          openly or they are enemies who make an outward display of friendliness 
          towards Muslims and Islam, but that is not real. We must be distinguished 
          by this characteristic which is the characteristic of the saved group, 
          i.e., being united.","Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Rasaa’il li Fadeelat al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, vol. 1, p. 38-41"

There are hadiths which indicate that it is permissible to use cotton to stop the flow of blood. For more, see the detailed answer.","Islam: A religion of cleanliness


Are tampons haram?","Praise be to Allah.Islam: A religion of cleanliness
The Muslim is always commanded to avoid najasah (impure things), because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And purify your garments!” [al-Muddaththir 74:4]
Are tampons haram?
Menstrual blood is najis (impure), and if it gets on a woman's clothes, she has to wash them. 
With regard to these tampons, we should refer to what women customarily use. At the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), the women used to wear special clothes at the time of menstruation. 
Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “My period came when I was with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), so I slipped away from him and put on the clothes I used to wear when I was menstruating…” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, al-Hayd, 311). 
And the general guideline is that things are permitted unless there is evidence to indicate that this is not allowed. 
So, it is not correct to say that using tampons is haram in Islam. In fact, there are reports which indicate that it is permitted to use cotton to stop the flow of blood. 
Hamnah bint Jahsh menstruated at the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and she came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, “I have a strong, prolonged flow of blood.” He said to her: “Block it with cotton.” She said, “It is greater than that. My blood gushes.” He said, “Consider yourself to be on your menses each month for six or seven days known to Allah, then do ghusl and pray and fast for twenty-three or twenty-four days. Delay Zuhr prayer and bring ‘Asr forward, and do ghusl for them. And delay Maghrib and bring ‘Isha forward and do ghusl for them. This is the more beloved of the two ways to me.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah, al-Taharah wa Sunanuha, 619. Classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih Sunan Ibn Majah, no. 510).

10590,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10590,The Tolerance of Islam,How can we prove to non-Muslims that Islam is a tolerant and easy religion?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Islam is the religion of mercy and kindness, the religion of tolerance and ease. Allah has not burdened this ummah (community, nation) with more than it can bear. Whatever good it does, it will be rewarded for it, and whatever evil it does, it will have to bear the burden of that sin, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope. He gets reward for that (good) which he has earned, and he is punished for that (evil) which he has earned” [al-Baqarah 2:286] 
Allah has spared the Muslims any difficulty or hardship in all that He has enjoined upon them. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“He has chosen you (to convey His Message of Islamic Monotheism to mankind by inviting them to His religion of Islam), and has not laid upon you in religion any hardship” [al-Hajj 22:78] 
Every sin that a Muslim commits because he makes a mistake, or forgets, or is forced to do it, is forgiven by Allah, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error” [al-Baqarah 2:286] 
And Allah says: your prayer is granted. 
The Muslim will be brought to account for what he does deliberately, not for what he does by mistake, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And there is no sin on you concerning that in which you made a mistake, except in regard to what your hearts deliberately intend” [al-Ahzaab 33:5] 
Allah is Kind and Merciful. He sent Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) with ease and the tolerant monotheism: 
“Allah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you
[al-Baqarah 2:185 – interpretation of the meaning]   
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Religion is very easy and whoever overburdens himself in his religion will not be able to continue in that way. So you should not be extremists, but try to be near to perfection and receive the good tidings that you will be rewarded.” (narrated by al-Bukhaari, 39). 
The Shaytaan is man's greatest enemy. He makes him forget the remembrance of his Lord (dhikr) and makes his sin attractive to him, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Shaytaan (Satan) has overpowered them. So he has made them forget the remembrance of Allah. They are the party of Shaytaan (Satan). Verily, it is the party of Shaytaan (Satan) that will be the losers![al-Mujaadilah 58:19] 
What one’s own nafs (self) says has been forgiven by Allah, The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has forgiven my ummah for thoughts that cross their minds, so long as they do not speak of them or act upon them.” (Narrated by Muslim, 127) 
Whoever commits a sin then Allah conceals it, it is not permissible for him to speak of it, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “All of my ummah will be fine except those who commit sin openly.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2990). 
If a person commits a sin then repents, Allah will accept his repentance: 
“Your Lord has written (prescribed) Mercy for Himself, so that if any of you does evil in ignorance, and thereafter repents and does righteous good deeds (by obeying Allah), then surely, He is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful” [al-An’aam 6:54 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Allah is Generous and Kind, He multiplies the reward for good deeds and forgives bad deeds, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, narrating the words of his Lord: “Allah has decreed hasanaat (good deeds) and sayi’aat (bad deeds), then He explained that. Whoever intends to do a good deed then does not do it, Allah will write it down as one complete hasanah; if he intends to do it then he does it, then Allah will write it down as between ten and seven hundred hasanaat, or more.  Whoever intends to do a bad deed, then he does not do it, Allah will write it down as one complete hasanah; if he intends to do it then he does it, Allah will write it down as one sayi’ah.” (Agreed upon; narrated by al-Bukhaari, Kitaab al-Raqaa’iq, 81)","From Usool al-Deen al-Islami, by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem al-Tuwayjri"
