Or does it mean every instance where a man is alone with a woman even if that is in view of people?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.What is meant by the kind of khulwah that is haram is not only a man being alone with a non-mahram woman in a room where no one can see them, rather it includes their being alone in any place where they can converse with one another, even if that is where others can see them but not hear them, and whether that is in the open air, in a car, on the roof of a house, or wherever. Khulwah is forbidden because it is the forerunner of zina (adultery, fornication) and the means that leads to zina. Every case that is like this comes under the same rulings as khulwah in the sense of being away from where people can see you.

21608,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21608,Ruling on male student shaking hands with a female classmate,What is the ruling on a male student shaking hands with a female classmate? What should he do if she holds out her hand to greet him?,,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permitted to study in a mixed setting with female students in one place or in one school or on one bench. This is one of the greatest causes of fitnah (temptation) and it is not permissible for a male or female student to take part in this, because of the fitnah involved. The Muslim should not shake hands with a non-mahram female, even if she holds out her hand for him to shake, and he should tell her that shaking hands with a non-mahram man is not permitted, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, when accepting the allegiance (bay’ah) of women: “I do not shake hands with women.” And it was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “By Allah, the hand of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) never touched the hand of any (non-mahram) woman; he used to accept their allegiance in words only.” And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Indeed in the Messenger of Allah (Muhammad) you have a good example to follow for him who hopes for (the Meeting with) Allah and the Last Day, and remembers Allah much” [al-Ahzaab 33:21]
For a woman to shake hands with someone who is not her mahram is something that may lead to temptation for both parties, so it must be avoided. 
There is nothing wrong with the shar’i greeting of salaam in which there is no fitnah and no shaking hands, and which does not give rise to doubts and does not involve any softness in speech, and in which hijaab is observed and there is no being alone with a member of the opposite sex, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O wives of the Prophet! You are not like any other women. If you keep your duty (to Allah), then be not soft in speech, lest he in whose heart is a disease (of hypocrisy, or evil desire for adultery) should be moved with desire, but speak in an honourable manner” [al-Ahzaab 33:32]
 At the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), the women used to greet him and ask him questions concerning things they did not understand, and the women also used to ask the companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) concerning things they did not understand. 
With regard to a woman shaking hands with other women, or shaking hands with men who are her mahrams, such as her brothers, uncles, etc., there is nothing wrong with that.","Al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah in al-Fataawa al-Jaami’ah li’l-Mar’ah al-Muslimah, part 3, p. 988"

     What these people should do, who have people working for 
    them in their houses, is to enable them to pray in congregation, because of 
    the great reward and goodness that that will bring. This is a kind of 
    cooperating in righteousness and piety. Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning):

    “Help you one another in Al-Birr 
    and At-Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another 
    in sin and transgression”

    [al-Maa’idah 5:5]

     It is not permissible for them to prevent them from praying 
    in congregation, because praying in congregation is a shar’i obligation, and 
    a shar’i obligation exempts one from work, because obedience to Allaah and 
    His Messenger takes precedence over obedience to any human being. But if 
    this worker is prevented from praying in congregation and he needs his job, 
    then he is excused in this case, because he is being prevented and this is 
    not his choice, rather if he were to leave his work that would cause trouble

(please assume that both man and woman lives in USA). If not, how can this issue resolove when both parties believe of their custody rights?

If the woman got married, does she loose automaically her custody right to the man?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.With regard to custody, if the former spouses 
    came from different cities, the basic principle concerning custody – so long as the child has not yet reached the age of seven – is that the 
    mother has custody, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “You have more right to it so long as you have not 
    remarried.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 1938. This is the basic principle. 
But there is another principle, which is that 
    the matter of custody is based on whatever is in the best interests of the child. If travelling with his mother or father will be harmful to the 
    child, then custody should be given to the parent who will not harm the child by travelling. If the mother’s travelling to another city will not 
    have any harmful effects on the child, then the basic principle is that custody is hers. 
With regard to referring to the courts of a 
    non-Muslim country to resolve the matter of custody, that is not permissible, because this is referring to taaghoot (falsehood, false 
    judges) for judgement, and Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And whosoever does not judge by what 
    Allaah has revealed, such are the Kaafiroon (i.e. disbelievers — of a lesser degree as they do not act on Allaah’s Laws)”
[al-Maa'idah 5:44] 
“So judge among them by what Allaah has 
    revealed, and follow not their vain desires, diverging away from the truth that has come to you. To each among you, We have prescribed a law and a 
    clear way”
[al-Maa'idah 5:48]
The two former spouses should go to the 
    Islamic center and ask the scholars or knowledgeable people there to judge between them. 
If the woman remarries, she loses the right to custody, because of the hadeeth quoted above.

Du`a at times of tribulation and hardship","Praise be to Allah.The Prophet’s prayers at times of tribulation
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to seek refuge with Allah a great deal from trials and tribulations , as it says in the Hadith of Zayd ibn Thabit (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Seek refuge with Allah from trials and tribulations, both visible and hidden.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2867) 
It was narrated from Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “My Lord came to me tonight in the most beautiful form…” and in this Hadith he said that Allah said, “O Muhammad, when you pray, then say: `Allahumma inni as’aluka fi`l Al-khayrat wa tark Al-munkarat, wa hubb Al-masakin, wa an taghfira li wa tarhamani wa tatuba `alayya. Wa in aradta bi `ibadika fitnatan, faqbidni ilayka ghayra maftun (O Allah, I ask You (to enable me) to do good deeds and avoid evil deeds, and to love the poor, and (I ask You) to forgive me, have mercy on me and accept my repentance. If You will that some trial should befall Your slaves, then take me to You [i.e., cause me to die] without having subjected to that trial).” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 3233; Al-Albani said of this Hadith is authentic in Sahih At-Targhib wat-Tarhib, 408) 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to seek refuge from trials and tribulations because when they come they do not befall the wrongdoers only, rather they befall everyone. 
Du`a at times of tribulation and hardship
It is a good idea to acquaint ourselves with the Hadiths that mention Dhikrs which have to do with trials and tribulations and disasters, so that we may call upon Allah with these words and spread this knowledge and memorize whatever we can of them… and understand their meanings so that we can worship Allah by means of them, because they are the greatest words that can be spoken in these circumstances. 
·         Abu Burdah ibn `Abdullah narrated from his father that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was afraid of some people he would say, “Allahumma inna naj`aluka fi nuhurihim wa na`udhu bika min shururihim (O Allah, we place You before them and we seek refuge in You from their evil).” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 1537; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud, 1360)
·         It was narrated from Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say at times of distress : “La ilaha ill-Allah Al-`Athim Al-Halim, la ilaha ill-Allah Rabb Al-`Arsh Al-`Athim, la ilaha ill-Allah Rabb us-samawati wa Rabb ul-ard wa Rabb ul-`Arsh il-karim (There is none worthy of worship but Allah, the All-Powerful, the Forbearing; there is none worthy of worship but Allah, Lord of the mighty Throne; there is none worthy of worship but Allah, Lord of heaven, Lord of earth, and Lord of the noble Throne).” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 6345; Muslim, 2730)
·         The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The words of relief are: La ilaha ill-Allah Al-`Athim Al-Halim, la ilaha ill-Allah Rabb Al-`Arsh Al-`Athzim, la ilaha ill-Allah Rabb us-samawati wa Rabb ul-ard wa Rabb ul-`Arsh il-karim (There is none worthy of worship but t Allah, the All-Powerful, the Forbearing; there is none worthy of worship but Allah, Lord of the mighty Throne; there is none worthy of worship but Allah, Lord of heaven, Lord of earth, and Lord of the noble Throne).” (Sahih Al-Jami` As-Saghir wa Ziyadatuhu, 4571) 
·         When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went on a military campaign he would say, `Allahumma anta `adudi wa anta nasiri wa bika uqatil (O Allah, You are my help and You are my support and by Your help I fight).” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 3584; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih At-Tirmidhi, 2836.)
·         The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Shall I not tell you of something that, if any worldly calamity or disaster befalls any man among you and he says these words, he will be relieved of it. (It is) the Du’a’ of Dhu’n-Nun: “La ilaha illa anta subhanaka inni kuntu min Ath-thalimin (none has the right to be worshipped but You (O Allah), Glorified (and Exalted) be You [above all that (evil) they associate with You]! Truly, I have been of the wrongdoers).” According to another report: “No Muslim man says this Du’a’ concerning anything but Allah will answer his prayer.” (Sahih Al-Jami’ As-Saghir wa Ziyadatuhu, 2065)
·         The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to teach his Companions to say these words when they felt afraid: “A’udhu bi kalimat-illah il-tammati min ghadabihi wa min sharri `ibadihi wa min hamazat Ash-shayatini wa an yahdurun (I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allah from His wrath and from the evil of His slaves and from the evil promptings of the devils and from their presence).” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 3893; classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud, 3294)

·         If some matter was troubling him, he would say, Ya Hayyu ya Qayyum bi rahmatika astaghith (O Ever-Living, O Sustainer, by Your mercy I seek Your help).” According to another report: “If some matter worried him or distressed him.” Sahih Al-Jami` As-Saghir, 4791) 
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: to Asma’ bint `Umays (may Allah be pleased with her), “Shall I not teach you some words which you can say at times of distress and hardship ? `Allahu Allahu rabbi la ushriku bihi shay’an (Allah is my Lord, I do not associate anything with Him).’” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 1525; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud, 1349) 
According to a version narrated in Al-Sahih Al-Jami’, “Whoever is afflicted by worry, distress, sickness or hardship, and says, Allahu Allahu rabbi la sharika lah (Allah is my Lord, He has no partner or associate), will be relieved of that.” 
And there are other Hadiths which will have a positive effect in times of tribulation and fear, bringing peace of mind and physical safety, and drawing one closer to Allah… We should be content with that which has been narrated in authentic reports from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), for that is sufficient and we have no need to report that are not sound.

21615,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21615,Refutation of those who say that women should not pray Eid in the mosque,Why Women are not allowed for EID's Namaz in Masjid?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Whoever says that women should not pray Eid in the mosque should note that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded women to go out to the Eid prayers. It was narrated that Umm ‘Atiyyah said: “We were commanded to go out on the day of Eid, even to bring out the virgins from their seclusion and the menstruating women, who would be behind the people, joining in their takbeer and du’aa’s, sharing the blessings of this day.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, al-Jumu’ah, 918) 
But if a woman is menstruating she should keep away from the prayer place and not enter it, but she should witness the good and the du’aa’ of the Muslims, and listen to the khutbah from outside the prayer place. A woman should avoid wearing adornments and go out wearing old clothes which do not form any kind of adornment in themselves, so that she will not be a source of temptation to men. She should not go out wearing perfume. ‘Abd-Allah ibn al-Mubaarak said, “If a woman insists on going out, then her husband should give her permission to go out wearing old clothes and not wearing adornments.

“And those who guard their Salaah (prayers) well”[al-Ma’aarij 70:34]
If a person has an excuse and he missed a prayer, then he has to make it up, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever forgets a prayer or sleeps and misses it, the expiation for this sin is to pray it when he remembers it.” (Narrated by Muslim, al-Masaajid wa Mawaadi’ al-Salaah, 1103)
If you miss a prayer, then you have to pray that prayer first, then pray the current prayer; it is not permissible to delay (making up the missed prayer). It is commonly thought among the people that if a man misses a fard prayer, he should make it up with the corresponding fard prayer of the next day, so that if, for example, he missed Fajr on one day he can only pray it with Fajr on the second day. This is wrong, and it goes against the teaching of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), in both his words and deeds.
It was narrated that he said: “Whoever forgets a prayer or sleeps and misses it, then let him pray it when he remembers it.” He did not say, let him pray it on the following day when the time for that prayer comes, rather he said, “let him pray it when he remembers it.” With regard to his actions, when he missed a prayer on one of the days of the campaign of al-Khandaq, he prayed it before the current prayer, which indicates that one has to pray the missed prayer and then pray the current prayer. But if he forgets and prays the current prayer before the missed prayer, or he was ignorant and did not know (of the ruling), then he prayer is valid because he has an excuse.
(See Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, vol. 12, p. 222)
The hadeeth about the prayer on the day of al-Khandaq was narrated by al-Nasaa’i from ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Abi Sa’eed from his father, who said: “The mushrikeen kept us busy on the day of al-Khandaq and distracted us from praying Zuhr until the sun set. Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded Bilaal to call the iqaamah for Zuhr prayer, and he prayed it, then he called the iqaamah for Asr and he prayed it, then he called the adhaan for Maghrib then he prayed it as he usually prayed it, on time.” (al-Adhaan, 655; classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Nasaa’i, no. 638)
The action of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) indicates that it is obligatory to pray the missed prayers in the right order. But if there is only enough time left to pray the current prayer, then he should pray the current prayer, then pray the ones that came before it.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

It is a symbol of tawhid.","Hajj: A symbol of Tawhid


Meaning of the Talbiyah","Praise be to Allah.Hajj: A symbol of Tawhid
Hajj is the symbol of Tawhid (the Oneness of Allah) from the first moment the pilgrim enters ihram. Jabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah said, describing the Hajj of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Then he started to say the words of Tawhid, ‘“Labbayka Allahumma labbayk, labbayka la sharika laka labbayk. Inna al-hamd wa’l-ni’mata laka wa’l-mulk, la sharika lak  (Here I am, O Allah, here I am. Here I am, You have no partner, here I am. Verily all praise and blessings are Yours, and all sovereignty, You have no partner).’” (Narrated by Muslim)
Anas said, describing how the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) entered ihram, that he said: “Labbayka ‘Umratan la riya-a fiha wa la sum’ah (Here I am for ‘Umrah in which there is no showing off or seeking reputation).”  
This trains the soul to acknowledge the Oneness of Allah and to be sincere towards Him. 
The pilgrim starts his Hajj with Tawhid, and continues to recite the Talbiyah with its words of Tawhid, and he moves from one action to the next with Tawhid . 
Meaning of the Talbiyah
The Talbiyah has a number of meanings, such as: 

“Labbayka Allahumma labbayk (Here I am, O Allah, here I am)” is one response after another, which is repeated to show that the response is lasting and ongoing.
“Labbayka Allahumma labbayk (Here I am, O Allah, here I am)” means, I submit and submit again, i.e., ongoing submission.
It may mean staying in one place (labba bi’l-makan) and clinging to it, which means, I am persisting in obeying You, thus emphasizing the meaning of continuous servitude to Allah.
One of the meanings of the Talbiyah is confirming the love of Allah. There is an Arabic phrase imra-ah labbah (a loving woman) which refers to a woman who loves her child. One only says “Labbayk (Here I am at your service)” to a person whom one loves and respects.
It implies sincerity, as in the phrase lubb al-shay which means the essence of a thing, and lubb al-rajul which means a man’s mind and heart.
It implies drawing close, as in the word ilbab, which means drawing close, so it emphasizes the meaning of seeking to draw closer and closer to Allah.
It is a symbol of the Tawhid of the religion of Ibrahim , which is the spirit and aim of Hajj, indeed the spirit and aim of all the acts of worship. Hence the Talbiyah is the key to this act of worship that the pilgrim is embarking on.

The Talbiyah also includes: 

Praise of Allah, which is the dearest thing with which a person may draw close to Allah. 
It implies recognition of the blessings of Allah, for He is the source of all blessings and the One Who bestows them. 
And it includes acknowledging that all sovereignty belongs to Allah Alone, and no one else has any true dominion. (See Mukhtasar Tahdhib al-Sunan, by Ibn al-Qayyim, 2/335-339) 
When the pilgrim is reciting the Talbiyah, he feels a connection with all other created beings, as they all join with him in submission to Allah Alone and echo his Talbiyah. The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no Muslim who recites the Talbiyah but whatever is to his right and to his left of stones, rocks and clods recites it with him, to the furthest point to the east and the west” – meaning from his right and his left. (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 828; also by Ibn Khuzaymah and al-Bayhaqi  with a sahih isnad.)

21631,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21631,Benefits of Calamities,"I have seen on TV many of the calamities that have befallen the Muslim ummah (global community); in Palestine our wounds are bleeding; in Chechnya our bodies are cut; in Afghanistan our houses are destroyed; in the Philippines and in Kashmir… and now in Iraq.
Tomorrow only Allah knows who will meet this fate…
Are these calamities and these disasters that we see good or bad?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Disasters and calamities have been created for a reason, which none can fully comprehend but Allah. Some of the things that Allah has shown to us indicate this. 
1 – Disasters and calamities are a test of the believer’s patience. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Or think you that you will enter Paradise without such (trials) as came to those who passed away before you? They were afflicted with severe poverty and ailments and were so shaken that even the Messenger and those who believed along with him said, ‘When (will come) the Help of Allah?’ Yes! Certainly, the Help of Allah is near!”
[al-Baqarah 2:214] 
2 – This is a sign of man's weakness and his need for his Lord, and shows that he cannot succeed unless he realizes his need for his Lord and starts beseeching Him. 
3 – Calamities are a means of expiation of sin and raising one's status. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is nothing that befalls a believer, not even a thorn that pricks him, but Allah will record one good deed for him and will remove one bad deed from him.”
Narrated by Muslim. 
It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Trials will continue to befall the believing man and woman, with regard to themselves, their children and their wealth, until they meet Allah with no sin on them.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2399; classed as saheeh (authentic) by al-Albani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 2280. 
And it was narrated that Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “On the Day of Resurrection, when people who had suffered affliction are given their reward, those who were healthy will wish their skins had been cut to pieces with scissors when they were in the world.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2402. See al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, no. 2206. 
4 – One of the reasons for calamities is so that people will not feel content only with this world. If the world were free of calamities, man would love it more and feel content with it, and would forget about the Hereafter. But calamities wake him up from his negligence and make him strive for the place in which there are no calamities or trials.  
5 – One of the greatest reasons behind calamities and trials is to warn against falling short in some matters, so that man can make up for the areas in which he has fallen short. This is like the warning that is issued to an employee or student who is falling short. The purpose behind it is to make him make up for his shortcomings. If he does that, then all well and good, otherwise he deserves to be punished. The evidence for that includes the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, We sent (Messengers) to many nations before you (O Muhammad). And We seized them with extreme poverty (or loss in wealth) and loss in health (with calamities) so that they might humble themselves (believe with humility).
When Our Torment reached them, why then did they not humble themselves (believe with humility)? But their hearts became hardened, and Shaytan (Satan) made fair‑seeming to them that which they used to do.”
[al-An’am 6:42] 
Another reason for calamities is as a punishment for those who were previously warned, but did not benefit from the warning and mend their ways, and persisted in their sin. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“…so We destroyed them for their sins …”
[al-Anfal 8:54] 
And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And indeed, We destroyed generations before you when they did wrong, while their Messengers came to them with clear proofs, but they were not such as to believe! Thus do We requite the people who are Mujrimoon (criminals).”
[Yoonus 10:13] 
“And when We decide to destroy a town (population), We (first) send a definite order (to obey Allah and be righteous) to those among them [or We (first) increase in number those of its population] who lead a life of luxury. Then, they transgress therein, and thus the word (of torment) is justified against it (them). Then We destroy it with complete destruction.”
[al-Isra 17:16] 
Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Grief may be accompanied by that for which a person will be rewarded and praised, so it may be good in that sense, not that grief is good in and of itself, such as one who feels sad for falling short in religious matters or for calamities that befall the Muslims. In this case a person will be rewarded for what is in his heart of loving good and hating evil, and so on, but grief in itself, if it leads to failure to do that which is enjoined, namely patience, jihad (fighting for Allah’s cause), seeking benefits and warding off harm, is forbidden, but if the person does not give it up, and it is not recorded as a sin for him then he is fine.” 
So the one who wishes that Allah would change his situation without any effort on his part and that of others like him needs to understand this. 
6 – Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, We sent (Messengers) to many nations before you (O Muhammad). And We seized them with extreme poverty (or loss in wealth) and loss in health (with calamities) so that they might humble themselves (believe with humility).”
[al-An’am 6:42] 
Al-Sa’di (may Allah have mercy on him) said: (This means) We sent (Messengers) to the nations who came before you, and they disbelieved in Our Messengers and rejected Our signs. So We seized them with poverty, sickness, calamities and disasters as a mercy from Us to them, so that they might humble themselves before us and turn to Us at times of hardship. 
And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Evil (sins and disobedience to Allah) has appeared on land and sea because of what the hands of men have earned (by oppression and evil deeds), that He (Allah) may make them taste a part of that which they have done, in order that they may return (by repenting to Allah, and begging His Pardon).”
[al-Room 30:41] 
Al-Sa’di interprets the word fasad (translated here as “evil”) as referring to the disasters that develop on land and sea, which are making people’s lives difficult and causing a lot of problems with regard to their livelihood and well-being.                                                                         
And the disasters that befall them themselves, such as diseases, plagues and the like, which happen because of the things their own hands have wrought of evil deeds that can only lead to bad consequences.  
The phrase, “that He (Allah) may make them taste a part of that which they have done,” means, so that they might know that Allah is requiting them for their deeds, so He gives them a foretaste of the recompense of their deeds in this world, “in order that they may return (by repenting to Allah, and begging His Pardon)” i.e., repent from their deeds that have had this bad effect on them, and set their affairs straight. 
Glory be to the One Who blesses by means of His punishment, for if He were to make them taste all that they have done, no living creature would be left alive on earth. 
7 – Worship at times of hardship and tribulation has a special flavour and a special reward. 
It was narrated from Ma’qil ibn Yasar that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Worshipping at times of tribulation and confusion is like migrating to join me.” Narrated by Muslim, 2948. 
Al-Nawawi said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ‘Worshipping at times of tribulation and confusion is like migrating to join me.’ The reason why worship at such times is of such great virtue is that people become negligent about worship and are distracted from it, and no one focuses on worship except a few.” 
Al-Qurtubi said: “Tribulation and great hardship will happen until the matter of religion is taken lightly and people will care about nothing but their worldly affairs and how to earn a living. So worship becomes very important at times of tribulation, as Muslim narrated from Ma’qil ibn Yasar in the marfoo’ report (one attributed to the Prophet): ‘Worshipping at times of tribulation and confusion is like migrating to join me.’” 
8 – Blessings that come after pain, hardship and calamity are more precious to people. 
So then they appreciate the blessings of good health and safety as they should be appreciated.  
Another of the benefits of calamity is a reminder of how Allah has blessed man, because the man who is created with sight – for example – forgets the blessing of sight and does not really appreciate it, but if Allah tests him with temporary blindness, then restores to him his sight, he will fully understand the value of this blessing. If things are always easy a person may forget this blessing and not be grateful for it, so Allah takes it away and then restores it, as a reminder to him to be grateful for it. 
Calamity may remind the person to whom it happens and others of the blessings of Allah. So when a person sees one who is insane, he appreciates the blessing of sanity; when he sees one who is sick, he appreciates the blessing of sound health. When he sees a kafir who is living like cattle, he appreciates the blessing of faith. When he sees an ignorant man he appreciates the blessing of knowledge. Only the one whose heart is open will feel this. Those who have no heart do not give thanks for the blessings of Allah, rather they are arrogant towards the creation of Allah. 
9 – The benefit of calamity is that it rescues man from negligence and alerts him to his shortcomings in keeping his duty to Allah, so that he does not think that he is perfect, which would lead to the hardening of his heart and negligence. 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“When Our torment reached them, why then did they not humble themselves (believe with humility)? But their hearts became hardened, and Shaytan (Satan) made fair‑seeming to them that which they used to do.”
[al-An’am 6:43] 
10 – One of the benefits of tribulations and hardships is purification. 
Hardships reveal how people really are, and distinguish the good from the bad, the true from the false, the believer from the hypocrite. Allah says of the Battle of Uhud and what happened to the Muslims on that day, explaining part of the wisdom behind this trial (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allah will not leave the believers in the state in which you are now, until He distinguishes the wicked from the good.”
[Aal ‘Imran 3:179] 
So the true nature of all things is shown clearly. 
11 – When Muslims help those Muslims who have been afflicted by calamity, they will be rewarded for that. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The likeness of the believers in their mutual love, mercy and compassion is that of the body; when one part of it suffers, the rest of the body joins it in staying awake and suffering fever.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 6011; Muslim, 2586. 
And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “None of you truly believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 13; Muslim, 45. 
12 – At times of hardship and war we see the true meaning of the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Help you one another in Al‑Birr and At‑Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety).”
[al-Maidah 5:2] 
Ways of cooperating in da’wah (propagation) and supporting Islam include: waging jihad against the kuffar (disbelievers) and hypocrites for the sake of Allah, joining with the people of Islamic da’wah in fighting the followers of kufr (disbelief) and misguidance, and preparing all means and tools for jihad for the sake of Allah. 
One of the ways of cooperating in supporting Islam that was invented at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is cooperating in killing those who claimed to be Prophets, killing the leaders of the mushrikeen (pagans) and the apostates, including those who insulted the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).

21636,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21636,Why did the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) not tell us when the Hour would begin?,Why did the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) not tell us when the Hour would begin?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 
The Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not tell us when the Hour would 
    begin because he did not know when the Hour would begin. We have already 
    quoted in question no. 
    32627 the evidence from the Qur’aan and Sunnah 
    concerning that. 

    Secondly: 

    If it is asked: why did Allaah not tell us when the Hour 
    would begin? 

    The answer is that wisdom dictates that the time should be 
    hidden from mankind. 

    The reason for that is that the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) was sent with glad tidings of Paradise for 
    those who obey Allaah, and with warnings of Hell for those who disobey Him, 
    and with warnings of the Hour and of Hell and its horrors. The purpose of 
    that can only be achieved if the time of the Hour is concealed, so that the 
    people of every era will fear that it may come upon them. Announcing the 
    time when it will happen would cancel out that benefit and would also have 
    other evil consequences. If the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) had told the people: The Hour will come one 
    thousand years from today, for example, you would have seen the liars 
    mocking this idea and persisting in their disbelief, and the doubts of the 
    doubters would have increased. 

    So there is great wisdom in concealing the matter of the 
    Hour, as Allaah has also concealed the time of each person’s own “Hour,” 
    meaning his death. 

    Al-Aloosi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    Allaah has concealed the knowledge of the Hour because shar’i 
    wisdom and reason dictate that this should be so, because that is more 
    effective in calling people to obey Him and putting them off disobeying Him. 
    Similarly he has also concealed the lifespan of each person. The verses 
    indicate that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    did not know when the Hour would begin. Yes, he knew that it was close in 
    general terms, and he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told 
    us of that. 

    End quote. 

    So the believers must fear that Day and their fear should 
    make them aware that Allaah is always watching what they do. So they should 
    adhere to what is true and seek what is good, and they should fear evil and 
    sin, and they should not make the Hour the focus only of disputes and 
    arguments. 

    End quote, from Tafseer al-Manaar. 

    It is by Allaah’s mercy towards His creation that He has told 
    them of signs which will indicate that the onset of the Hour is approaching, 
    so that that will motivate them to do righteous deeds and fear Allaah, and 
    avoid haraam things. Every time they see one of its signs, their fear of the 
    Hour and its horrors will increase, as will their certainty that it is at 
    hand, so they will prepare for it by doing more righteous deeds. 

    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Do they then await (anything) other than the Hour that it 
    should come upon them suddenly? But some of its portents (indications and 
    signs) have already come”

    [Muhammad 47:18]

    This is also indicated by the report narrated by Muslim 
    (2947), that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said: “Hasten to do good deeds before six things come to pass: the rising of 
    the sun from the west, the smoke, the Dajjaal, the Beast, and that which 
    will come to each one of you alone, and that which will affect everyone.”

    Narrated by Muslim, 2947. 

    This means: try to beat the six signs that the Hour has 
    begun, and hasten to do righteous deeds before they come to pass, for good 
    deeds done after they appear will not be accepted and will not count. 

    “That which will come to each one of you alone” refers to 
    death. “That which will affect everyone” means the Resurrection. 

    Al-Qaadi said: He commanded them to hasten to do righteous 
    deeds before these signs came to pass, for when they come they will dazzle 
    people and will distract them from doing anything, or will close the door of 
    repentance and acceptance of deeds to them. 

    Al-‘Alaa’i said: The purpose of these reports is to encourage 
    us to start doing righteous deeds before we die, and to make the most of our 
    time before disaster comes. 

    We ask Allaah to help us to make the most of our time in obeying Him.

I stayed in Makkah until my period ended, then I entered ihraam from Makkah. Is this permissible, or what should I do?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
This action is not permissible. The woman who intends to do ‘Umrah is not permitted to pass the meeqaat without entering ihraam; even if she is menstruating, she should enter ihraam whilst she is menstruating, and her ihraam is valid. The evidence for that is the fact that Asma’ bint ‘Umays, the wife of Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with them both) had given birth, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had stopped in Dhu’l-Hulayfah on his way to the Farewell Pilgrimage. She sent word to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asking what she should do. He said, “Do ghusl and bandage your private part with a cloth and enter ihraam.” 
The blood of menstruation is like the bleeding following childbirth, so we say to the woman who is menstruating: If you pass by the meeqaat and you are intending to do ‘Umrah or Hajj, then do ghusl and bandage your private part with a cloth and enter ihraam. 
“Bandage your private part with a cloth” means tying a piece of cloth over the vagina, then entering ihraam, whether for Hajj or ‘Umrah. 
But if you enter ihraam and reach Makkah, you should not go to the Ka’bah or do tawaaf, until you have become pure (i.e. until your period ends). Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to ‘Aa’ishah when she was menstruating during ‘Umrah, “Do everything that the pilgrims do but do not circumambulate the House until you become pure.” This was narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim. In Saheeh al-Bukhaari it also says that ‘Aa’ishah said that when she became pure she circumambulated the House and did saa’i between al-Safa and al-Marwah. This indicates that when a woman enters ihraam for Hajj or ‘Umrah when she is menstruating, or if her period comes before she does tawaaf, then she should not do tawaaf or saa’i until she becomes pure (i.e., her period ends) and she does ghusl. But if she does tawaaf when she is taahir (pure) and her period comes after she has finished tawaaf, she should go on and do saa’i even if she is menstruating, then she should cut her hair and end her ‘Umrah, because tahaarah (purity) is not a necessary condition of saa’i between al-Safa and al-marwah.

With regard to your interactions with them by backbiting about them and praying against them, and other kinds of actions which are indicative of hatred, this serves no purpose.

Because of the killing of al-Husayn, the Shaytaan started to spread two kinds of bidah (innovation) amongst the people: the bidah of grieving and wailing on the Day of Aashooraa, striking the cheeks, screaming, weeping and reciting eulogies ; and the bidah of expressing happiness and joy. So some express grief and others express joy, so they started to like the idea of wearing kohl, taking a bath, spending on their families and preparing special kinds of food on the day of Aashooraa and every bidah is a going astray; none of the four imams of the Muslims or others approved of either of these things (either expressing grief or expressing joy)

 From the words “started to” in the question it may be understood that she has not become completely pure; she has to be completely pure. When she becomes pure (i.e., the nifaas ends), she should do ghusl and do tawaaf and saa’i.

Why are you sleeping after `Asr when Ibn Lahi`ah has told us … (and he mentioned it)?’ Al-Layth said: ‘I do not give up something that is good for me because of the Hadith of Ibn Lahi`ah from ‘Aqil!’” 
I say, I am impressed by this answer of Al-Layth, because it is indicative of understanding and knowledge, and no wonder, for he was one of the Imams of the Muslims and well known jurists. I know that many of the Shaykhs today do not let themselves sleep after `Asr, even if they need to do that. If it is said to them that the Hadith concerning that is inauthentic, they will immediately respond by saying, “inauthentic Ahadith should be followed with regard to virtuous actions.”

          It was reported in a hadeeth narrated 
          by Abu Dawood that Abu Hurayrah said: “Whilst a man was praying with 
          his izaar (lower garment) hanging below his ankles, the Messenger of 
          Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Go and do wudoo’.”… 
          He said, “He was praying with his izaar hanging below his ankles, and 
          Allaah does not accept the prayer of a man who lets his izaar hang below 
          his ankles. (Narrated by Abu Dawood, al-Salaah, 543. This was 
          classed as da’eef (weak) by al-Albaani in Da’eef Sunan Abi Dawood, 
          no. 124). 
 
          With regard to the validity of prayer, 
          Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was asked about that and he said: If the garment 
          is hanging down below the ankles, then it is haraam, because the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Whatever part of 
          the izaar (lower garment) is hanging down below the ankles is in the 
          Fire.” What the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said concerning the izaar 
          also applies to other types of clothing. 
 
          Based on this, a person has to lift his 
          thobe (galabiyah) or other garments to be above his ankles. If he prays 
          in it when it is below his ankles, then there is a difference of opinion 
          among the scholars as to whether his prayer is valid. 
 
          Some of them think that his prayer is 
          valid, because this man has done what is obligatory, i.e., covering 
          his ‘awrah. 
 
          Some of them think that his prayer is not valid, because 
          he has covered his ‘awrah with a haraam garment. They say that one of 
          the conditions of covering the ‘awrah is that the garment worn should 
          be permissible. So a man is in danger if he prays in a garment that 
          comes down below his ankles; he should fear Allaah and raise his garment 
          so that it will be above his ankles.

21652,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21652,Is it permissible to drink in one breath?,I come home thirsty and I drink a cup of water in one breath. Is this OK?,,,"Praise be to Allah.It was narrated from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade breathing into one’s drink. A man said to him, “O Messenger of Allaah, my thirst is not quenched in one breath.” The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to him: “Remove the cup from your mouth, then take a breath.” He said, “What if I see specks in it?” He said, “Then pour them out.” 
(Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1887; classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in al-Silsilat al-Saheehah, 385). 
Shaykh al-Albaani said, discussing what we learn from this hadeeth: 
It is permissible to drink in one breath, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not denounce the man when he said, “My thirst is not quenched in one breath.” If drinking in one breath were not permissible, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would have explained that to him, and he would have said, for example, “And is it permissible to drink in one breath?!” That would have been more appropriate than saying, “Remove the cup from your mouth…” if that were not permissible. What he did say indicates that it is permissible to drink in one breath, and that if he wants to take a breath he should do so outside the vessel. This is what is clearly stated in the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him), who said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘When any one of you drinks, let him not breathe into the vessel. If he wants to take a breath, then let him remove the cup from his mouth, then if he wants to drink more he may do so.” (al-Saheehah, 386). 
Al-Haafiz said in al-Fath: 
“Maalik used this as evidence to indicate that it is permissible to drink in one breath. Ibn Abi Shaybah narrated that doing so is permissible from Sa’eed ibn al-Musayyib and a group [of scholars]. ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez said: what he forbade was breathing into the vessel, but if a person does not breathe into the vessel, if he wishes he may drink in one breath.” 
Furthermore, what was said above about it being permissible to drink in one breath does not contradict the fact that the Sunnah is to drink in three breaths. Both are permissible, but the latter is preferable, because of the hadeeth of Anas ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: “When he drank he would take a breath three times, and he said, that is more enjoyable and more healthy.”

        Abu Bakr ibn 
          al-‘Arabi said:
        
        Covenants are 
          of two types: one for which expiation may be offered and another for 
          which there is no expiation. That for which expiation may be offered 
          is that which is intended as a vow to refrain from doing something or 
          to do something. 

        
        The second type 
          is a covenant in which the two parties are bound in a manner that is 
          permissible according to sharee’ah, and is binding, either exclusively 
          between them or amongst many people. It is not permissible to nullify 
          or abolish such a covenant, and it is not subject to kafaarah (expiation). 
          This is the covenant for which the one who breaks it will be gathered 
          (on the Day of Resurrection) as a betrayer, and a banner will be set 
          up for him commensurate with the degree of his betrayal, and it will 
          be said, “This is the betrayer of So and so.” Maalik says, a covenant

          Ibn Hajar al-Haythami was asked this question, and he 
          replied as follows: 
 
          When a person is doing wudoo’, he should respond, because 
          the Sunnah for the one who is doing wudoo’ is to refrain from speaking 
          apart from making dhikr (remembering Allaah). There is some dispute 
          as to whether making specific dhikr for each part of the body washed 
          is mandoob (recommended) or not, but the more correct view is that it 
          is not mandoob, as al-Nawawi said, because the ahaadeeth concerning 
          that are not free of lies and narrators who were accused of lying. (In 
          other words, the specific du’aa’s whilst washing the various parts of 
          the body during wudoo’ are not saheeh). 
 
          With regard to responding (to the muezzin), it is mandoob 
          according to scholarly consensus, hence they said that it is also mandoob 
          for one who is doing Tawaaf, even though he also has others dhikrs which 
          he should recite according to scholarly consensus, so that is more appropriate 
          in the case of the one who is doing wudoo’. 
 
          With regard to finishing wudoo’, if a person’s finishing 
          wudoo’ coincides with the muezzin’s finishing the adhaan, then he may 
          recite the dhikr of wudoo, as stated by al-Balqeeni in his fatwa, giving 
          it precedence over the dhikr to be recited immediately after the adhaan, 
          because the dhikr for wudoo’ has to do with the act of worship that 
          he has just completed, then he may recite the dhikr immediately following 
          the adhaan. 
 
          He said, it is good if he recites the Shahaadatayn of 
          wudoo’ then the du’aa’ following the adhaan, because it has to do with 
          praying for the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), then he may make du’aa’

          chapter called) al-Muqaddam, and I do not know of anyone who 
          stated that one of them was more correct than the other. The one which 
          appears to be more correct is that he should give water to the one who 
          is thirsty at that time, if there is the fear that he will die of thirst, 
          because his death is certain, unlike the one who has the water, who 
          has the chance of finding more water later on. But if he is in an arid 
          land where he despairs of finding water and he thinks it most likely 
          that death is inevitable if he gives away the water that he has with 
          him, then the matter is subject to further discussion, and it is more 
          likely that giving the water in this case is not obligatory. The same 
          applies if the thirsty person fears that he may lose a limb or become 
          sick etc. because of his thirst, and the one who has the water fears 
          that he may die later on, then it is also more likely to be correct

          with building and buikds more than he needs. There is no doubt that 
          what is necessary varies according to the size of the builder’s family, 
          whether it is large or small, and whether he entertains guests or not. 
          In that regard it is similar to the saheeh hadeeth, “A bed for the man, 
          a bed for his wife, a bed for their guest, and the fourth is for the 
          Shaytaan.” (Narrated by Muslim, 6/146 and others; also narrated in Saheeh

          “That is not the case, rather it is subject to further 
          explanation. Not everyone who builds more than he needs is necessarily

Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (May Allah have mercy on him) said:
“It is permissible for a worshipper to use anything as a Sutrah [an object placed in front of him to “screen” him whilst he is praying], even if it is an arrow.

Ibn Hajar said in Bulugh Al-Maram: Those who said that this Hadith is inauthentic are incorrect; rather it is sound.”

Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade worshippers to spit in front of them so that the sputum would be in front of them, and he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “For Allah is in front of him [the worshipper].” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 406) (Fatawa Ibn `Uthaymin, 13/326)

Conditions of intercession of the Day of Judgement


Types of rejected intercession","Praise be to Allah.When the distress becomes too great for the people on the Day of Judgement and they have stood for too long, suffering in the heat and terror and distress, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) says, “How will you be when Allah gathers you together like arrows in a quiver, for fifty thousand years, during which Allah will not look at you?” (Al-Silsilah Al-Sahihah, 2817). 
The people will look to those who are of high status to intercede for them with their Lord so that He might relieve them of this distress that they are suffering and come to pass judgement amongst them. 
So they will come to Adam, but he will excuse himself; then they will come to Nuh, but he will excuse himself; then they will come to Ibrahim, but he will excuse himself; then they will come to Musa, but he will excuse himself; then they will come to ‘Isa, but he will excuse himself. Then they will come to our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and he will say, “I am fit for that.” So he will intercede for the people in the place of gathering, so that judgement may be passed. This is the station of praise and glory which Allah has promised to him, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“It may be that your Lord will raise you to Maqam Mahmud (a station of praise and glory, i.e., the honour of intercession on the Day of Resurrection)” [Al-Isra 17:79] 
Hadith on intercession
There follows the lengthy hadith about intercession : 
It was narrated that Anas ibn Malik said: Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told us: “When the Day of Resurrection comes, the people will surge with each other like waves. They will come to Adam and say, ‘Intercede for us with your Lord.’ He will say, ‘I am not fit for that. Go to Ibrahim for he is the Close Friend of the Most Merciful.’ So they will go to Ibrahim, but he will say, ‘I am not fit for that. Go to Musa for he is the one to whom Allah spoke directly.’ So they will go to Musa but he will say, ‘I am not fit for that. Go to ‘Isa for he is a soul created by Allah and His Word.’ So they will go to ‘Isa but he will say, ‘I am not fit for that. Go to Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).’ So they will come to me and I will say, I am fit for that.’ Then I will ask my Lord for permission and He will give me permission, and He will inspire me with words of praise with which I will praise Him, words that I do not know now. So I will praise Him with those words of praise and I will prostrate before Him. He will say, ‘O Muhammad, raise your head. Speak and intercession will be granted to you, ask and you will be given, intercede and your intercession will be accepted.’ I will say, ‘O Lord, my ummah, my ummah!’ He will say, ‘Go and bring forth everyone in whose heart there is faith the weight of a barley-grain.’ So I will go and do that. Then I will come back and praise Him with those words of praise and I will fall prostrate before Him. He will say, ‘O Muhammad, raise your head. Speak and intercession will be granted to you, ask and you will be given, intercede and your intercession will be accepted.’ I will say, ‘O Lord, my ummah, my ummah!’ He will say, ‘Go and bring forth everyone in whose heart there is faith the weight of a small ant or a mustard-seed.’ So I will go and do that. Then I will come back and praise Him with those words of praise and I will fall prostrate before Him. He will say, ‘O Muhammad, raise your head. Speak and intercession will be granted to you, ask and you will be given, intercede and your intercession will be accepted.’ I will say, ‘O Lord, my ummah, my ummah!’ He will say, ‘Go and bring forth from the Fire everyone in whose heart there is faith the weight of the lightest, lightest grain of mustard-seed.’ So I will go and bring them forth.”  
When we left Anas I [the narrator of the hadith] said to some of our companions, “Why don’t we go to al-Hasan, who is hiding in the house of Abu Khalifah, and tell him what Anas ibn Malik has told us?” So we went to him, greeted him with salam and he gave us permission to enter. Then we said, “O Abu Sa’id, we have come to you from your brother Anas ibn Malik, and we have never heard anything like what he narrated to us about intercession.” He said, “Tell me.” So we narrated the hadith to him and we came to this point and he said, “Keep going.” We said, “He did not tell us any more.”  He said, “He told me this hadith when he was a young man, twenty years ago. I do not know if he forgot or if he did not want to let you depend on what he might have said. We said, “O Abu Sa’id, tell us.” He smiled and said, “ Man was created hasty. I only mentioned that because I wanted to inform you of it. Anas told me the same as he told you, and said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) added: “Then I will come back a fourth time and praise Him with those words of praise and I will fall prostrate before Him. He will say, ‘O Muhammad, raise your head. Speak and intercession will be granted to you, ask and you will be given, intercede and your intercession will be accepted.’ I will say, ‘O Lord, give me permission (to bring forth) all those who said La ilaha ill-Allah.’ He will say, ‘By My Might, My Majesty, My Supremacy and My Greatness, I will most certainly bring forth from it those who said La ilaha ill-Allah.’” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 7510) 
It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I will be the leader of mankind on the Day of Resurrection. Do you know why that is? Allah will gather mankind, the first and the last of them, in one place, so that the caller will be able to make them all hear his voice and the watcher will be able to see them all. The sun will be brought close and the people will suffer such distress and trouble that they will not be able to bear it or stand it. The people will say, ‘Don't you see in the state you are in and the condition you have reached? Why don't you look for someone who can intercede for you with your Lord?’ The people will say to one another: ‘Go to your father, Adam.’ So they will go to Adam (peace be upon him) … I will go and prostrate beneath the Throne. Then I will be given words of praise that have never been given to anyone before me, then it will be said, ‘O Muhammad! Raise your head; ask, for it will be given to you, and intercede, for your intercession will be accepted.’ I will raise my head and say, ‘My ummah, O lord! My ummah, O Lord!’ It will be said, ‘O Muhammad, admit from among your ummah those who will not be brought to account from the right-hand gate of Paradise, and they will share the other gates with the people.’ He said, By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, the distance between two of the gate-posts is like the distance between Makkah and Humayr, or between Makkah and Busra.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 4712) 
This is the great intercession in the place of standing, and it is intercession so that judgement may be passed. 
Type of intercession on the Day of Judgement
Intercession on the Day of Resurrection is of two types : 

Intercession which will be accepted. This is intercession which is proven in the texts of shari’ah. More details will be given below. 
Intercession which will be rejected. This is intercession which according to the texts of the Quran and Sunnah is invalid and ineffective, as we shall see below. 

Types of accepted intercession
Accepted intercession is of various types: 

The greatest intercession, which is al-maqam al-mahmud, which the earlier and later generations will ask the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to intercede for them with their Lord so that He might relieve them of the horrors of the Day of Judgement. This has been explained above.
Intercession for those among the monotheists who committed major sins and entered Hell, that they may be brought forth from it. It was narrated that Anas said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “My intercession will be for those among my ummah who committed major sins.” (Sahih Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 1983).
The intercession of the Messenger for people whose good deeds and bad deeds are equal, that they may enter Paradise, and for others who had been ordered to Hell, that they may not enter it.
Intercession that some people may enter Paradise without being brought to account.
Intercession of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) for his paternal uncle Abu Talib, so that the torment of the Fire be reduced for him. This applies only in the case of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his paternal uncle Abu Talib.
The intercession of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that the believers might be granted permission to enter Paradise. 

Intercession for those who committed sin will not be granted only to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), rather the prophets, the martyrs, the scholars, the righteous and the angels will also join in that. A man’s righteous deeds may also intercede for him. But the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) will have the greatest share of intercession. 
Intercession of prophets and others
There follows a hadith which indicates that intercession will be granted to the prophets and others. It was narrated that Abu Sa’id al-Khudri said: “We said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, will we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection?’” … and he quoted the hadith, until he came to the part which describes how the believers will pass across the Sirat and will intercede for their brothers who have entered Hell: “They will say, ‘O Lord, our brothers used to pray with us and fast with us and do good deeds with us.’ Allah will say, ‘Go, and whoever you find with a dinar’s-weight of faith in his heart, bring him forth, and Allah will forbid their bodies to the Fire.’ So they will go, and some of them will be sinking into the Fire up to their feet or shins, and they will bring forth those whom they recognize. Then they will come back, and He will say, ‘Go, and whoever you find with half a dinar’s-weight of faith in his heart, bring him forth.’ So they will go and bring forth those whom they recognize. Then they will come back, and He will say, ‘Go, and whoever you find with an atom’s-weight of faith in his heart, bring him forth.’ So they will go and bring forth those whom they recognize.” Abu Sa’id said: “If you do not believe me, then read the verse interpretation of the meaning): 
‘Surely, Allah wrongs not even the weight of an atom (or a small ant), but if there is any good (done), He doubles it, and gives from Him a great reward’ [Al-Nisa 4:40].” 
[The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:] “So the prophets, the angels and the believers will intercede, and the Compeller (Allah) will say, ‘There remains My intercession.’ Then He will take a handful from the Fire and bring forth some people whose bodies have been burnt and throw them into a river at the entrance to Paradise that is called the Water of Life.  
They will grow on its banks, as a seed carried by a flood grows. You have seen how it grows beside a rock or beside a tree, and how the side facing the sun is usually green while the side facing the shade is white. They will come out like pearls, and necklaces will be placed around their necks. Then they will enter Paradise, and the people of Paradise will say, ‘These are the people emancipated by the Most Merciful. He has admitted them into Paradise without them having done any good deeds and without them having sent forth any good (for themselves).’ Then it will be said to them, ‘You will have what you have seen and the equivalent thereof.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 7440) 
Conditions of intercession of the Day of Judgement
Intercession of the Day of Resurrection will only be granted if three conditions are met, as indicated in the verses (interpretation of the meaning):
“And there are many angels in the heavens, whose intercession will avail nothing except after Allah has given leave for whom He wills and is pleased with” [Al-Najm 53:26] 
“On that day no intercession shall avail, except the one for whom the Most Gracious (Allah) has given permission and whose word is acceptable to Him” [Ta-Ha 20:109]
“He knows what is before them, and what is behind them, and they cannot intercede except for him with whom He is pleased. And they stand in awe for fear of Him” [Al-Anbiya 21:28] 
“Who is he that can intercede with Him except with His Permission?” [Al-Baqarah 2:255]
These conditions are: 

The permission of Allah to the intercessor to intercede.
Allah’s being pleased with the intercessor.
His being pleased with the one for whom intercession is made.

It was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that the intercession of some people will not be accepted on the Day of Resurrection, including those who cursed a great deal. Muslim narrated that Abu’l-Darda said: “I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say, ‘Those who curse will not be witnesses or intercessors on the Day of Resurrection.” 
Types of rejected intercession
With regard to the kind of intercession that will be rejected, this is intercession that does not meet the conditions required of permission from Allah or His being pleased (with the intercessor or the one for whom intercession is made), such as the intercession which the people of shirk believe that their gods will achieve. They only worship them because they believe that they will intercede for them with Allah, and that they are mediators or intermediaries between them and Allah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Surely, the religion (i.e. the worship and the obedience) is for Allah only. And those who take Awliya (protectors, helpers, lords, gods) besides Him (say): ‘We worship them only so that they may bring us near to Allah.’ Verily, Allah will judge between them concerning that wherein they differ. Truly, Allah guides not him who is a liar, and a disbeliever” [Al-Zumar 39:3] 
Allah tells us that this kind of intercession is ineffective and of no benefit, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So no intercession of intercessors will be of any use to them” [Al-Muddaththir 74:48] 
“And fear a Day (of Judgement) when a person shall not avail another, nor will intercession be accepted from him nor will compensation be taken from him nor will they be helped” [Al-Baqarah 2:48] 
“And fear the Day (of Judgement) when no person shall avail another, nor shall compensation be accepted from him, nor shall intercession be of use to him, nor shall they be helped” [Al-Baqarah 2:123] 
“O you who believe! Spend of that with which We have provided for you, before a Day comes when there will be no bargaining, nor friendship, nor intercession. And it is the disbelievers who are the Zalimun (wrongdoers)” [Al-Baqarah 2:254]
Hence Allah did not accept the intercession of His Close Friend Ibrahim for his father Azar who was a mushrik. It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Ibrahim will meet his father on the Day of Resurrection, and Azar’s face will be dark and covered with dust. Ibrahim will say to him, ‘Did I not tell you not to disobey me?’ His father will say, ‘Today I will not disobey you.'’ Ibrahim will say, ‘O Lord! You promised me not to disgrace me on the Day of Resurrection; and what will be more disgraceful to me than cursing and dishonoring my father?’ Then Allah will say, ‘I have forbidden Paradise to the disbelievers.’ Then he will be addressed, ‘O Ibrahim, what is beneath your feet?’ He will look and there he will see a Dhabh (an animal,) blood-stained, which will be caught by the legs and thrown into the Fire.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3350).

21673,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21673,Should he focus on purifying his heart or on doing naafil acts?,"Which is more important – dealing with feelings and thoughts that Allah dislikes, such as destructive envy, hatred, arrogance, showing off, thinking highly of one's deeds, hard-heartedness, etc., which form the evil that resides in the heart, or focusing on doing outward naafil deeds such as prayer, fasting and other acts of worship and fulfilling vows even though those other things are present in the heart? Please advise us, may Allah reward you with good.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Some of the acts mentioned are obligatory, and those which are obligatory should be given precedence, as Allah says according to the hadith qudsi narrated from His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “My slave does not draw near to Me with anything more loved by Me than the religious duties I have enjoined on him.” Then He says: “And My slave continues to draw near to Me with supererogatory works so that I shall love him.” Outward physical acts are not valid and acceptable unless they are accompanied by appropriate actions of the heart, because the heart is like the king and the physical faculties are like his troops. If the king is evil his troops will also be evil. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “In the body there is a piece of flesh: if it is sound the whole body will be sound and if it is corrupt then the whole body will be corrupt.”  Similarly the (hidden) actions of the heart inevitably affect the (visible) physical actions. So precedence must be given to that which is more obligatory, whether it is called inward or outward. Perhaps things that are called inward may be more obligatory, such as refraining from destructive envy and arrogance, for that is more essential than observing naafil fasts. Or acts that are described as outward or physical may be better, such as qiyaam al-layl (praying at night), which is better than simply giving up some thoughts that may cross one's mind such as (non-destructive) jealousy, etc. Inward and outward deeds support one another, and prayer keeps one from doing evil actions and generates fear of Allah, and has other important effects. It (prayer) is the best of good deeds and charity. And Allah knows best. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him), Majmoo’ al-Fatawa, 6/381 
So there is no separation between correcting what is inward and correcting what is outward or physical. 
The outward acts of worship which a person performs with his physical faculties – if he does them for the sake of Allah – will undoubtedly have an effect on his inward nature. 
For example, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Shall I not tell you of something that will take away the evil of the heart? Fasting three days of each month.” (Narrated by al-Nasaa’i, 2386; classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Nasaa’i, 2249). The evil of the heart refers to rancour, hatred and destructive envy. 
One of the most important remedies for diseases of the heart is to study and ponder the texts which include warnings to the one who leaves these diseases to fester in his heart, such as the hadith in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No one will enter Paradise who has an atom’s-weight of arrogance in his heart.” (Narrated by Muslim, 91). 
And the hadith according to which Hell will say, “My share is the arrogant.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 4850; Muslim, 2846) 
And the hadith: “On the Day of Resurrection the arrogant will be gathered like ants in the form of men.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2492; classed as hasan by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 2025). 
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The disease of the nations who came before you has started to spread among you: destructive envy and hatred. These are the shavers. I do not mean that they shave hair but they shave away religious commitment. By the One in Whose hand is my soul, you will not enter Paradise until you believe, and you will not believe until you love one another. Shall I not tell you of something which if you do it, you will love one another. Spread (the greeting of) salaam amongst yourselves.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2510; classed as hasan by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 2038). 
Whoever ponders with true insight such warnings about the diseases of the heart will undoubtedly strive to cleanse his heart thereof, and will seek help in doing so by doing outward physical acts, praying to his Lord to cleanse his heart of hatred, destructive envy, rancour and so on, as Allah says, describing the prayer of the believers: 
“and put not in our hearts any hatred against those who have believed”

How to treat anxiety in Islam


Can a believer become mentally ill?","Praise be to Allah.Can Muslims seek medical treatment?
There is nothing wrong with treating the diseases that befall a person, and this is not forbidden. But that is subject to the condition that the treatment does not cause side effects which are worse than the problem itself. 
Does ruqyah cure anxiety?
We advise the one who is sick – whether that is spiritual (mental) illness such as anxiety and depression , or physical illness such as various kinds of pain – to hasten first of all to treat the problem with ruqyah as prescribed in Shari`ah. This means verses and hadiths which are recommended in Shari`ah and in which the texts state there is healing for diseases. 
Herbal treatment for anxiety 
Then we advise treating it with natural materials which Allah has created, such as honey and plants, for Allah has created special properties in them which may treat many kinds of diseases, and at the same time they do not have any side effects on the one who takes them. 
How to treat anxiety in Islam
We think that you should not take artificial chemical remedies for anxiety . For this disease a person needs a spiritual remedy rather than a chemical one. 

So he needs to increase his faith and his trust in his Lord; he needs to make more du`a and pray more. If he does that, his anxiety will be removed. 
Seeking to relax by means of doing acts of worship has a great effect on the soul, dispelling many kinds of psychological disease. 

Hence we do not see any benefit in going to a psychologist whose beliefs are corrupt, let alone one who is a non-Muslim. The more the doctor knows about Allah and His religion, the better advice he will give to his patient.  
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Whoever works righteousness — whether male or female — while he (or she) is a true believer (of Islamic Monotheism) verily, to him We will give a good life (in this world with respect, contentment and lawful provision), and We shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion to the best of what they used to do (i.e. Paradise in the Hereafter)” [Al-Nahl 16:97]
Suh’ayb said: the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “How wonderful is the affair of the believer, for all his affairs are good, and this applies to no one except the believer. If something good happens to him, he gives thanks, and that is good for him, and if something bad happens to him, he bears it with patience, and that is good for him.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2999) 

This world should not be the main concern of the Muslim. Worry about his provision should not find any room in his heart or mind, lest that make his sickness and his anxiety worse. 

Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever is mainly concerned about the Hereafter, Allah will make him feel independent of others and will make him focused and content, and his worldly affairs will fall into place. But whoever is mainly concerned with this world, Allah will make him feel in constant need of others and will make him distracted and unfocused, and he will get nothing of this world except what is decreed for him.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2389; classed as sahih by Shaykh al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami’, 6510) 
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“When a person spends his entire day with no other concern but Allah Alone, Allah, may He be glorified, will take care of all his needs and take care of all that is worrying him; He will empty his heart so that it will be filled only with love for Him, free his tongue so that it will speak only in remembrance of Him (dhikr) and cause all his faculties to work only in obedience to Him. But if a person spends his entire day with no other concern but this world, Allah will make him bear its distress, anxiety and pain; He will leave him to sort himself out, and cause his heart to be distracted from the love of Allah towards the love of some created being, cause his tongue to speak only in remembering people instead of remembering Allah, and cause him to use his talents and energy in obeying and serving them. So he will strive hard, labouring like some work-animal, to serve something other than Allah… Everyone who turns away from being a true slave of Allah and obeying Him and loving Him will be burdened with servitude, love and obedience to some created being. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘And whosoever turns away (blinds himself) from the remembrance of the Most Beneficent (Allah), We appoint for him a shaytan (devil) to be a qarin (intimate companion) to him.’ [Al-Zukhruf 43:36].” (Al-Fawaid, p. 159)
Can a believer become mentally ill?
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked:
Can a believer become mentally ill? What is the treatment for that according to Shari`ah? Please note that modern medicine treats these illnesses with modern medicines only.
He replied:
“Undoubtedly a person may suffer from psychological or mental diseases, such as anxiety about the future and regret for the past. Psychological diseases affect the body more than physical diseases affect it. Treating these diseases by means of the things prescribed in Shari`ah – i.e., ruqyah – is more effective than treating them with physical medicines, as is well known.

One of the means of treating them is mentioned in the sahih hadith from Ibn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him): “There is no-one who is afflicted by distress and grief, and says: ‘Allahumma inni ‘abduka ibn ‘abdika ibn amatika nasyati bi yadika, madin fiyya hukmuka, ‘adlun fiyya qadauka. As-aluka bi kulli ismin huwa laka sammayta bihi nafsaka aw anzaltahu fi kitabika aw ‘allamtahu ahadan min khalqika aw istatharta bihi fi ‘ilm il-ghayb ‘indaka an taj’al al-Qurana rabi’a qalbi wa nura sadri wa jala-a huzni wa dhahaba hammi (O Allah, I am Your slave, son of Your slave, son of Your maidservant; my forelock is in Your hand, Your command over me is forever executed and Your decree over me is just. I ask You by every name belonging to You which You have named Yourself with, or revealed in Your Book, or You taught to any of Your creation, or You have preserved in the knowledge of the Unseen with You, that You make the Quran the life of my heart and the light of my breast, and a departure for my sorrow and a release for my anxiety),’ but Allah will take away his distress and grief, and replace it with joy.” This is one of the remedies prescribed in Shari`ah.
One can also say “La ilaha illa Anta, subhaanaka inni kuntu min al-zalimin (none has the right to be worshipped but You (O Allah), Glorified (and Exalted) be You [Above all that (evil) they associate with You]! Truly, I have been of the wrongdoers)” [Al-Anbiya 21:87 – interpretation of the meaning] 

Whoever wants to know more than that should refer to what the scholars have written about dhikr, such as al-Wabil al-Sayyib by Ibn al-Qayyim; al-Kalim al-Tayyib by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Tayimiyah; al-Adhkar by al-Nawawi; Zad al-Ma’ad by Ibn al-Qayyim. 
But because people’s faith is weak nowadays, they are less receptive to the remedies prescribed in Shari`ah. So people nowadays have started to rely on physical medicines more than on the remedies prescribed in Shari`ah. But when a person’s faith is strong, the remedies prescribed in Shari`ah are completely effective, and may work faster than physical medicine. 
We all know about the story of the man whom the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sent on a campaign and he camped near some Arab people, but those people near whom he camped showed him no hospitality at all. Allah willed that their leader should be stung by a scorpion, and they said to one another, “Go to those people who have camped nearby, perhaps you will find a raqi (one who can recite ruqyah) with them.” The Companions said to them, “We will not recite ruqyah for your leader unless you give us such and such a number of sheep.” They said, “Fine.” So one of the Companions went and recited ruqyah for the one who had been stung. He recited Surat al-Fatihah only, and the one who had been stung got up as if released from a chain. 
Reciting al-Fatihah had such an effect on this man because it came from a heart that was filled with faith. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked him, “How did you come to know that it (Surat al-Fatihah) could be recited as a ruqyah?” 
But in these times when religious commitment and faith have become weak, people have started to rely on external physical medicines, and they are suffering as a result. 
But on the other hand there are charlatans who play with people’s minds; they are clever and are able to trick people, claiming that they are good reciters of ruqyah when in fact they are consuming people’s wealth unlawfully. So people are caught between two extremes; one extreme is those who think that ruqyah has no effect at all, and the other is those tricksters who play with people’s minds by reciting false and deceitful readings. And there are some who are moderate in their approach to this issue.  (Fatawa Islamiyyah, 4/465, 466)

21679,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21679,The gathering of mankind and the animals,What can you tell us about how people will look following the Resurrection? Will people will be wearing clothes or not? Will the animals be resurrected after death or not?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Allaah calls the Day of Resurrection the Day of Gathering 
    because Allaah will gather His slaves, mankind and the jinn. Allaah says: 

    “Indeed in that (there) is a sure lesson for those who 
    fear the torment of the Hereafter. That is a Day whereon mankind will be 
    gathered together, and that is a Day when all (the dwellers of the heavens 
    and the earth) will be present”

    [Hood 11:103] 

    “Say (O Muhammad): (Yes) verily, those of old, and those 
    of later times.

    All will surely be gathered together for appointed Meeting 
    of a known Day”

    [al-Waaqiyah 56:49-50] 

    “There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes unto 
    the Most Gracious (Allaah) as a slave.

    Verily, He knows each one of them, and has counted them a 
    full counting.

    And everyone of them will come to Him alone on the Day of 
    Resurrection (without any helper, or protector or defender)”

    [Maryam 19:93-95] 

    “And (remember) the Day We shall cause the mountains to 
    pass away (like clouds of dust), and you will see the earth as a levelled 
    plain, and we shall gather them all together so as to leave not one of them 
    behind”

    [al-Kahf 18:47]

    Also included in this gathering are the animals. Shaykh 
    al-Islam (Ibn Taymiyah) said: 

    “As for the animals, they will all be gathered by Allaah, as 
    is indicated by the Qur’aan and Sunnah. Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    ‘There is not a moving (living) creature on earth, nor a 
    bird that flies with its two wings, but are communities like you. We have 
    neglected nothing in the Book, then unto their Lord they (all) shall be 
    gathered’

    [al-An’aam 6:38] 

    ‘And when the wild beasts are gathered together’

    [al-Takweer 81:5] 

    ‘And among His Ayaat (proofs, evidences, lessons, signs, 
    etc.) is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and whatever moving 
    (living) creatures He has dispersed in them both. And He is All-Potent over 
    their assembling (i.e. resurrecting them on the Day of Resurrection after 
    their death, and dispersion of their bodies) whenever He wills’

    [al-Shoora 42:29]
The word idha (translated 
    here as when or whenever) refers to something that will inevitably come to 
    pass. And there are many well known ahaadeeth on this topic. On the Day of 
    Resurrection Allaah will gather the animals, and the scores among them will 
    be settled. Then it will be said to them, “Be dust!” and they will become 
    dust. At that point the kaafir will say, “Would that I were dust!” (al-Naba’ 
    72:40 – interpretation of the meaning). Whoever says that they will not be 
    brought back to life is making a serious mistake, indeed he is misguided or 
    is a kaafir. And Allaah knows best. 

    Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 4/248 

    Ahmad (20534) narrated from Abu Dharr that the Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was sitting, and two 
    sheep locked horns, and one of them butted the other and defeated it. The 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) smiled, 
    and it was said to him, “Why are you smiling, O Messenger of Allaah?” He 
    said, “Because of the sheep. By the One in Whose hand is my soul, it will 
    settle its score with the other on the Day of Resurrection.”  

    Ahmad Shaakir said, its isnaad is hasan and unbroken. 

    Muslim (2582) narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger 
    of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “All rights 
    will be restored on the Day of Resurrection, until even the hornless sheep 
    will settle its score with the one that has horns.” 

    Al-Nawawi said: 

    This clearly indicates that the animals will be gathered on 
    the Day of Resurrection, and that they will be brought back to life like 
    human beings who are accountable, and like children and the insane and those 
    who were not reached by the call of Islam. This is what is indicated by the 
    Qur’aan and Sunnah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And when the wild beasts are gathered together”

    [al-Takweer 81:5]

    If something is stated in a shar’i text, and there is no 
    rational or shar’i reason not to interpret it according to what it appears 
    to mean, then it must be taken at face value. The scholars said that it is 
    not a condition of the gathering or the resurrection that there should be 
    reward or punishment. With regard to the hornless sheep settling their 
    scores with those that have horns, this is not the retaliation that comes 
    with accountability, because they are not accountable. Rather it is simply 
    settling the scores. And Allaah knows best. 

    People will be gathered on the Day of Resurrection barefoot, 
    naked and uncircumcised. It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “You will be gathered barefoot, naked and uncircumcised.” 
    Then he recited, “As We began the first creation, We shall repeat it. (It 
    is) a promise binding upon Us. Truly, We shall do it” [al-Anbiya’ 21:104 – 
    interpretation of the meaning]. Then he said: “The first one to be 
    clothed on the Day of Resurrection will be Ibraaheem. Some people from among 
    my followers will be taken away towards the left and I will say, ‘My 
    followers, my followers!’ He will say, ‘They kept turning back on their 
    heels after you left them.’ And I will say what the righteous slave said:
    

    ‘And I was a witness over them while I dwelt amongst them, 
    but when You took me up, You were the Watcher over them; and You are a 
    Witness to all things. (This is a great admonition and warning to the 
    Christians of the whole world).

    If You punish them, they are Your slaves, and if You 
    forgive them, verily, You, only You, are the All-Mighty, the All-Wise’
    

    [al-Maa’idah 5:117].”

    (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3349) 
It was narrated that 
    ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: “The Messenger of Allaah 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘You will be gathered 
    barefoot, naked and uncircumcised.’ I said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, men and 
    women will be looking at one another?!’ He said, ‘The situation will be so 
    terrible that that will not concern them.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6527) 

    And it was narrated in the hadeeth that people will be 
    resurrected in the clothes in which they died. It was narrated that when Abu 
    Sa’eed al-Khudri was dying, he called for new clothes and put them on, then 
    he said, “I heard the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) say, ‘The deceased will be resurrected in the clothes in 
    which he died.’” (Narrated by Abu Dawood, 3114; classed as saheeh by 
    al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 1671). 
This hadeeth may seem to 
    contradict the hadeeth quoted above, which says that they will be 
    resurrected naked. The scholars reconciled between the two reports by noting 
    the following points: 

    1-That they will be raised in 
    those garments but they will wear out after the resurrection, and when they 
    reach the place of standing they will be naked.

    2-They will be raised naked then 
    when the Prophets and Siddeeqs etc have been clothed, everyone else will be 
    clothed in the same kind of clothes as those in which they died.

    3-Some of the scholars 
    interpreted this hadeeth as referring to the martyrs (shuhada’), because 
    they are the ones whom the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) commanded should be buried in the clothes in which they died, so 
    they will be resurrected in their clothes in order to distinguish them from 
    others.

    4-What is meant by clothes is 
    righteous deeds, as in the verses (interpretation of the meanings)

    “and the raiment of righteousness, that is better”

    [al-A’raaf 7:26]

    “And purify your garments”

    [al-Muddaththir 74:4]
What is meant by a person 
    being resurrected according to what he was doing when he died is that if his 
    final action was good, then it will be good (for him) and if it was bad then 
    it will be bad (for him). This is indicated by the hadeeth of Jaabir who 
    said: “I heard the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    say, ‘Every person will be resurrected in the manner that he died.’” 
    (Narrated by Muslim, 2878) 

    And Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him): “The 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    ‘When Allaah sends down punishment upon a people, the punishment also 
    befalls those who were among them, then they will be resurrected according 
    to their deeds.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 7108). 

    This is also indicated by the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas (may 
    Allaah be pleased with him) who said: “Whilst a man was at ‘Arafah, he fell 
    from his mount and broke his neck (or it broke his neck). The Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, ‘Wash him with water and 
    lotus leaves, and shroud him in two garments, but do not apply perfume or 
    cover his head, for he will be raised on the Day of Resurrection reciting 
    the Talbiyah.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1265). 

    And it was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Every wound that the 
    Muslim receives for the sake of Allaah will appear on the Day of 
    Resurrection as it was at the time when it was inflicted; blood will be 
    flowing from the wound and its color will be that of blood but its smell 
    will be the fragrance of musk.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 237). 

    Hence it is mustahabb to encourage one who is dying to say 
    Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah, so that these good words will be his last words 
    in this world and he will be raised saying them on the Day of Resurrection. 
     

    See Fath al-Baari, 11/383 
The people will be 
    gathered on that Day on another earth, one that is different from this 
    earth, with specific features that are explained in the Sunnah. It was 
    narrated that Sahl ibn Sa’d said: “I heard the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) say, ‘The people will be gathered on the 
    Day of Resurrection on reddish white land like a pure loaf of bread (made 
    from pure fine flour).” Sahl or someone else said, “It will have no 
    landmarks for anyone (to make use of).” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6521) 

    ‘Afra’ (translated here as reddish) means white that has a 
    hint of redness; or it was said that it is intensely white; or it was said 
    that it means pure white.  A pure loaf of bread means a loaf that is made 
    from pure flour that is unadulterated.",Islam Q&A
21683,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21683,Reconciling between the hadeeth which says that whoever says Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah will enter Paradise and the idea that the mushrikeen will abide in Hell forever,"How can we reconcile between the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “There is no slave who says Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah then dies believing in that but he will enter Paradise,” and the idea that the mushrikeen and hypocrites will abide in Hell forever even though they said Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    said: 

    The hadeeth indicates that the one who says Laa ilaaha 
    ill-Allaah is a true believer, but he is tempted by his whims and 
    desires, so he does some acts of disobedience or major sins such as stealing 
    etc. 

    The belief of Ahl al-Sunnah wa'l-Jamaa'ah is that the destiny 
    of the believer, even if he commits a major sin, is Paradise. Whatever 
    punishment may come before Paradise is up to Allaah: if He wills, He will 
    punish him, and if He wills, He will forgive him. The evidence for that is 
    the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Verily, Allaah forgives not that partners should be set 
    up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to 
    whom He wills”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:48]

    So all those who committed sins – even if they were major 
    sins – if the sins were less than kufr, they will not be prevented from 
    entering Paradise. For the destiny of the one who did them is Paradise, but 
    he may be punished for the sins that he committed, or Allaah may forgive 
    him. The matter rests with Allaah. As for the hypocrites and followers of 
    bid’ahs which put a person beyond the pale of Islam, they did not really say
    Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah meaning it from the heart, because this 
    hypocrisy which led to kufr is the opposite of sincerity, and sincerity is 
    essential to saying Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah. 

    If a person says Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah, but he 
    believes that there is no God, or he believes that there is another god 
    alongside Allaah who controls the universe, or he believes that all the 
    companions of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    apostatized after his death, or other bid’ahs that put a person beyond the 
    pale of Islam, then such people are not sincere in their saying Laa 
    ilaaha ill-Allaah, because their bid’ah goes against the words of the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Whoever bears 
    witness that there is no god except Allaah or says Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah, 
    will enter Paradise.” 

    The Shahaadatayn must be spoken with sincerity. Listen to 
    what Allaah says concerning the munaafiqeen (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “And when they [the hypocrites] stand up for As-Salaah 
    (the prayer), they stand with laziness and to be seen of men, and they do 
    not remember Allaah but little”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:142]

    In the same passage, Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “Verily, the hypocrites will be in the lowest depth 
    (grade) of the Fire; no helper will you find for them”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:145]

    And Allaah says of them (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “When the hypocrites come to you (O Muhammad), they say: 
    ‘We bear witness that you are indeed the Messenger of Allaah’”

    [al-Munaafiqoon 63:1]

    This is merely verbal testimony, but: 

    “Allaah knows that you are indeed His Messenger, and 
    Allaah bears witness that the hypocrites are liars indeed”

    [al-Munaafiqoon 63:1 – interpretation of the meaning]

    i.e., that they are lying when they say, “We bear witness that you are indeed the Messenger of Allaah”. For they mention Allaah and bear witness to His Messenger, but their hearts are devoid of that which is uttered by their lips.","Liqa’ al-Baab al-Maftooh, no. 45"

Is there something about this somewhere, I am desperate for the answer as I do not want to live in a sinful relationship and displease Allah.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    What you have been told is not correct, because if one spouse 
    becomes Muslim before the other, then the other becomes Muslim before the 
    woman’s ‘iddah is over, then their original marriage remains valid. The 
    woman’s ‘iddah is three menstrual periods if she menstruates, or three 
    months if she is past menopause, or until delivery if she is pregnant.  This 
    is the view of al-Shaafa’i and Ahmad, and is the view of Maalik with regard 
    to cases like that mentioned in the question, which is where the wife 
    becomes Muslim before her husband. This is also indicated by many instances 
    that are mentioned in the Sunnah. 

    For example: the wife of Safwaan ibn Umayyah became Muslim on 
    the day of the Conquest of Makkah, then he became Muslim approximately one 
    month after her, and the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) did not order them to separate or tell them to make a new marriage 
    contract. She remained with him on the basis of their original marriage. Ibn 
    ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The fame of this hadeeth 
    is stronger than its isnaad.  

    But if the second partner became Muslim after the end of the 
    ‘iddah, in this case there is a difference of scholarly opinion. The correct 
    view is that if they agree to go back to one another on the basis of the 
    original marriage contract and the woman has not married someone else, that 
    is permissible and they do not need to do a new marriage contract. This is 
    the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and his student Ibn 
    al-Qayyim. It is also the view regarded as most correct by Shaykh Ibn 
    ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on them all). They quoted as evidence the 
    report narrated by Abu Dawood from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with 
    him), according to whom the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) returned his daughter Zaynab to her husband Abu’l-Aas on 
    the basis of their original marriage contract. Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 
    1134; Abu Dawood, 2230; Ibn Maajah, 2019; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in
    Saheeh Ibn Maajah.    
He became Muslim two 
    years after the revelation of the verses of al-Mumtahanah, in which it says 
    that Muslim woman are forbidden to mushrik men. It seems that her ‘iddah 
    would have ended within this period, but the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) still returned her to him on the basis of 
    the original marriage contract. 

     The point is that they remained married on the basis of 
    their original marriage contract and they did not need to do a new contract.

[al-Maa’idah 5:51]
This is similar to the view of ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr who said: “Whoever settles in the land of the mushrikeen and celebrates their Nawroz (new year) and Mahrajaan (festival) and imitates them until he dies will be gathered with them on the Day of Resurrection.” This may be interpreted as referring to absolute imitation which implies kufr and as meaning that imitation in part is therefore haram; or it may be interpreted as meaning that he is one of them to the extent that he imitates them, whether it is in ideas of kufr, sin or partaking in a ritual. It was narrated from Ibn ‘Umar that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade imitating the non-Arabs and said, “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.” This was also mentioned by al-Qaadi Abu Ya’laa. This was quoted by more than one of the scholars to show that it is makrooh to imitate forms of dress of the non-Muslims which are not known among the Muslims.
See ‘Awn al-Ma’bood Sharh Sunan Abi Dawood. 
Imitating the Kuffar falls into two categories: 
Imitation that is haram and imitation that is permitted: 
The first type is imitation that is haram: this means knowingly doing things that are unique characteristics of the religion of the Kuffar and that have not been referred to in our religion. This is haram and it may be a major sin; in some cases a person may even become a kaafir by doing that, according to the evidence, whether a person does that because he agrees with the Kuffar, or because of his whims and desires, or because of some specious arguments which make him feel that doing it will bring him benefit in this world and the next. If it is asked, is the one who does that out of ignorance a sinner, such as one who celebrates Christmas? The answer is that the one who is ignorant is not a sinner because he was unaware, but he has to be told, and if he persists he becomes a sinner. 
The second type is imitation that is permissible. This means doing something which is not originally taken from the Kuffar, but the Kuffar do it too. This does not involve a prohibition on resembling them, but one may miss out on the benefits of differing from them. 
Imitating or resembling the People of the Book (Jews and Christians) and others with regard to worldly matters is permissible only when the following conditions are met: 
1 – That should not be any of their traditions or rituals by which they are distinguished.
2 – That should not be part of their religion. A matter can be proven to be part of their religion though a trustworthy source, such as an aayah of the Qur’aan or a hadeeth of His Messenger, or via well-established reports, such as the prostration of greeting which was permitted to the previous nations.
3 – That should not be anything in Islam which refers specifically to that matter. If there is a specific reference in Islam, either approving or disapproving of it, then we must follow what our religion says about it.
4 – This resemblance should not lead to going against any of the commands of sharee’ah.
5 – That should not involve celebrating any of their festivals.
6 – The resemblance should be only according to what is needed, and no more.

21696,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21696,He bequeathed one-third of his wealth to his daughters as a punishment to his son for taking all the money,"One year before my father died, he gave to each of us – three daughters and one son – the papers pertaining to the accounts where he had deposited the money he had been saving for us; he had suffered a great deal during the years he was working abroad to save this money for us and provide us with this money. So none of us dared to withdraw any money without referring to him, out of respect for him.  

Then my brother withdrew all the money in the account following an argument which arose between my brother and my sister. My father (may Allaah have mercy on him) was on the girls’ side, which made my brother (may Allaah forgive him) withdraw all the money which my father had deposited in his account then handed over the documentation. When he (my brother) found out about this will, he started court proceedings to prove the will legally invalid. When his father found out about it from the bank, he was deeply shocked, and he told him to put the money back because he needed it, as he was sick. But my brother refused to return the money, which had a bad effect on my father. My father died angry with my brother, and he had written a will leaving one-third of his money to his daughters; this will was intended as a punishment to my brother which my father wrote before he died, understanding fully what he was saying.

I myself refused to accept this will because I was not comfortable with it, and I insisted on taking only that which was due to me according to sharee’ah. I advised my sisters to ignore this will, in order to correct any mistake that my father may have made and so as to uphold good relations with my brother as Allaah enjoins upon us to do. But my many attempts did not succeed, and they went ahead and executed the will through the courts. The tears of my mother (may Allaah have mercy on her) did not succeed in deterring them from insisting on the will being executed. I also tried several times to deter my brother from entering into a dispute with my sisters in the court, in order to protect the name and reputation of our father. I asked him to consider this as a punishment in this world for what he had done to my father. But he refused to give up what he considered to be his right for any reason, and all of them accused me of not supporting the truth. I kept myself out of this dispute by appointing a lawyer to declare my objection to this matter from the outset.

I hope that you can advise me of the shar’i ruling and what my siblings’ position is according to sharee’ah. Please tell me what my duty towards them is, when they have adopted this stance towards me on this matter despite my many attempts to maintain good relations with them and honour them.

Please advise me, may Allaah reward you.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    It is unfortunate that there are many such cases among 
    siblings, and what makes the matter even more regrettable is that the reason 
    for this dispute is money. In fact I appreciate our sister’s good nature and 
    wisdom, since she has preferred peace to entering into a dispute with her 
    brother, and she has tried to contain the problem and solve it within the 
    family. This in itself should be considered the beginning of a proper 
    solution. As for the answer to this question, it may be answered in the 
    following points: 

    Firstly: 

    The money which your father had saved for you and gone to 
    great lengths for your benefit, is the due of everyone whom Allaah has 
    decreed has a share of inheritance. Each of you has a share allotted by 
    sharee’ah after the death of your father; none of you have the right to keep 
    this money for himself and deny it to the rest of the heirs, because by 
    doing so he is transgressing upon the rights of others. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “but transgress not the limits. Truly, Allaah likes not 
    the transgressors”[al-Baqarah 2:190]

    It was narrated by Abu Harrah al-Raqaashi that his paternal 
    uncle said: “I was holding on to the reins of the she-camel of Messenger of 
    Allaah SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “A man’s wealth is 
    not permissible except with his consent.” (Narrated by Ahmad, 20172; classed 
    as saheeh al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Irwaa’, 1761). 

    On this basis, what your brother did by taking this money is 
    considered to be a haraam action, especially since he took the money when 
    your father was still alive and he is not entitled to any of the money until 
    after his father died. Indeed, after his father’s death he is not entitled 
    to anything more than the share which Allaah has allocated to him in the 
    laws of inheritance. So what your brother must do is to repent to Allaah and 
    restore the rights of people. 

    Secondly: 

    The will which your father wrote was not acceptable according 
    to sharee’ah, and it is not permissible for you to demand that it be 
    executed, because a person who is designated as an heir according to 
    sharee’ah cannot be given something in the will (wasiyyah). The 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah has 
    given each person his rights and no will can be made in favour of an heir.” 
    (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2120; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh 
    al-Tirmidhi, 1722), So it is not permissible for you to demand it, even 
    if your brother has taken your money. But you may demand what Allaah has 
    granted you in the laws of inheritance. 

    Thirdly: 

    You should continue to advise and guide them and try to bring 
    them together as much as you can. Remember that you will be rewarded by 
    Allaah for that. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):

    “There is no good in most of their 
    secret talks save (in) him who orders Sadaqah (charity in Allaah’s Cause), 
    or Ma‘roof (Islamic Monotheism and all the
    good and righteous deeds which Allaah 
    has ordained), or conciliation between mankind; and he who does this, 
    seeking the good Pleasure of Allaah, We shall give him a great reward” 
    [al-Nisa’ 4:114]

    Keep telling your sisters not to demand more than they are 
    entitled to, and that demanding one-third is something that is not 
    permitted. Try also to convince your brother, in a good way, to give your 
    sisters that which is rightfully theirs, and to show mercy to his sisters 
    after his father’s death instead of being a torment to them. You will 
    undoubtedly face problems in doing that, but be patient. We ask Allaah to 
    make you steadfast.

     Fourthly:

     If you are doing the right thing, it will not matter if 
    people blame you or accuse you of being biased. Be steadfast in adhering to 
    the truth. Finally, we call on all of you to fear Allaah and to ward off 
    this scandalous dispute which does not make anyone happy apart from the 
    Shaytaan, those in whose hearts is a disease and everyone who enjoys the 
    troubles of others or is filled with malicious envy.

     I ask Allaah to put things right between you. May Allaah 
    bless our Prophet Muhammad.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
21697,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21697,Does Making Up Missed Fasts Have to Be Done Consecutively?,"I missed five days in Ramadan when I did not fast because I was sick. Do I have to fast them consecutively, or can I fast one day each week?","It is not essential to make up for missed fasts consecutively. If he does that, it is better, but if he does not there is nothing wrong with that.",,"Praise be to Allah.The Imams agreed that in order to make up missed Ramadan fasts , one must fast a number of days equal to the number of days when you did not fast, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“…and whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number [of days which one did not observe fasts must be made up] from other days.” [Al-Baqarah 2:185]
It is not essential that these days be consecutive; you may fast them one after the other, or you may fast them separately, whether you fast one day each week or each month, or whatever is easy for you.
The evidence for that is the verse quoted above, because it does not specify that the days fasted to make up missed Ramadan fasts should be consecutive , rather it only stipulates that the number of days fasted be equal to the number of days missed. (See Al-Majmu`, 6/167; Al-Mughni, 4/408) 
The Standing Committee was asked: is it permissible to make up missed Ramadan fasts on separate days? 
They replied: “Yes, it is permissible to make up missed fasts on separate days, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“…and whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number [of days which one did not observe fasts must be made up] from other days.” [Al-Baqarah 2:185]
And Allah did not stipulate that these days must be consecutive.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 10/346) 
In Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn Baz (15/352) it says: “If a person did not fast for two or three or more days, he must make up those fasts but they do not have to be on consecutive days. If he does that, it is better, but if he does not there is nothing wrong with that.”

21698,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21698,Taking money to perform Hajj on behalf of others for the purpose of making money,"What is the ruling on one who takes money in order to perform Hajj on behalf of others, and his only intention is to make money?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    This question was put to Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may 
    Allaah have mercy on him) and he said: 

    The scholars say that if a person does Hajj for worldly 
    purposes and to make money, this is haraam. It is not permissible for him to 
    have any worldly gains when doing an action that is for the Hereafter, 
    because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Whosoever desires the life of the world and its glitter, 
    to them We shall pay in full (the wages of) their deeds therein, and they 
    will have no diminution therein.
They are those for whom 
    there is nothing in the Hereafter but Fire, and vain are the deeds they did 
    therein. And of no effect is that which they used to do”

    [Hood 11:15]

    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: Whoever does Hajj in order 
    to make money will have no share in the Hereafter, but if he takes money in 
    order to do Hajj or help him do Hajj, there is nothing wrong with that and 
    there is no sin on him. 

    Hence one must avoid taking money for the former purpose, 
    because there is the fear that his Hajj will not be accepted from him and 
    that the Hajj of the person on whose behalf he is doing it will not be valid 
    either. In that case he has to return the money to the person who gave it to 
    him, because we say that his own Hajj is not valid and the Hajj of the 
    person who delegated him to perform Hajj on his behalf is also not valid.

     But a person may take money as a means to enable him to perform Hajj on behalf of another, and he should make his intention to do what the one who paid the money wants him to do, and to draw closer to Allaah by worshipping Him through the rituals of Hajj and at the House of Allaah.",From Daleel al-Akhta’ allati yaqa’u fiha al-Haaj wa’l-Mu’tamir
