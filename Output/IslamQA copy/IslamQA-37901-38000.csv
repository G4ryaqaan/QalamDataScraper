“And do not have sexual relations with them (your wives) while you are in I‘tikaf (i.e. confining oneself in a mosque for prayers and invocations leaving the worldly activities) in the mosques.” [al-Baqarah 2:187]
Men and women are equal in this regard. 
Ibn Qudamah said in al-Mughni: 
“A woman has the right to observe i‘tikaf in any mosque , and that is not subject to the condition that it be a mosque where prayers are performed in congregation, because that is not obligatory upon her. This was the view of al-Shafi'i. 
She does not have the right to observe i'tikaf in her house, because Allah says “while you are in I‘tikaf (i.e. confining oneself in a mosque for prayers and invocations leaving the worldly activities) in the mosques”, and because the wives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked him for permission to observe i’tikaf in the mosque, and he gave them permission.” 
Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmu’ (6/480): 
“It is not correct for a man or a woman to observe i'tikaf anywhere except in the mosque.”

Conditions of the blood that invalidates the fast","Praise be to Allah.We ask Allah to bless you with a speedy recovery. 
Does bleeding break your fast?
Because this bleeding is caused by sickness, your fast is still valid, and you do not have to do anything even if the blood is a large amount, so long as it comes out without you doing anything (to cause it). 
Conditions of the blood that invalidates the fast
The guidelines concerning the blood that invalidates the fast are as follows: 

If the blood comes out as the result of a person’s actions or choice; this is subject to further discussion: 

(A) If the blood comes out by means of cupping, this invalidates the fast, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The cupper and the one to whom cupping is done both break their fast.”
(B) If it comes out by a means other than cupping, such as venesection (opening a vein). If the amount is large and that has an effect on the person’s body, then this invalidates his fast (such as donating blood). If the amount is small and it does not harm the person, then it does not invalidate his fast, such as the small amount of blood that is taken for testing.

If the blood comes out through no deliberate action, such as an accident or nosebleed or an injury to any part of the body, his fast is still valid even if the amount of blood is large. (Fatawa Islamiyyah, 2/132)

But if the blood that comes out through no deliberate action is of such a large amount that he becomes weak and unable to fast, then it is permissible for him to break his fast and he should fast another day to make up for it.

The same ruling applies to one who is junub (in a state of impurity following sexual activity) if he does not do ghusl until after dawn comes.

Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
The scholars of these cities are unanimously agreed that the fast of one who is junub is valid, whether that was as the result of a wet dream or of intercourse. 
If the blood of menstruation or nifaas (post-partum bleeding) stops at night, then dawn comes before the woman does ghusl, her fast is valid and she has to complete it, whether she did not do ghusl deliberately or because she forgot, with or without an excuse.

Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: If blood flows in his mouth or he burps up something (reflux) from the stomach, and he swallows it, then he has broken his fast even if it was a small amount, because the basic principle is that anything that goes from the mouth to the stomach breaks the fast. 
The basic principle is that the fast is broken by everything that reaches the stomach from the mouth, with exception of saliva because it is not possible to avoid it. But this principle applies to everything else.

How can sins happen in Ramadan?","Praise be to Allah.Are devils locked up in Ramadan? 
The idea that the devils are not present in Ramadan is not correct. What is proven from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is that the devils are chained up during Ramadan . 
Al-Bukhari (1899) and Muslim (1079) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When Ramadan comes, the gates of Paradise are opened, the gates of Hell are closed, and the devils are chained up .” 
How can sins happen in Ramadan?
Al-Qurtubi said: 
“If it is said, How come we see many evil actions and sins happening in Ramadan ? If the devils are chained up that would not happen. 
The answer is that evil actions are reduced on the part of those who fast meeting all the conditions of fasting and taking care to observe the proper etiquette; or that only some of the devils are chained up, namely the marids (strong ones), and not all of them, as it says in some reports; or that evils are reduced in this month, which is something noticeable – fewer evils happen in this month than in others. If all of them were to be chained up that does not mean that evil and sin would not happen, because there are other causes of evil apart from the devils, such as evil souls, bad habits and human devils.” (Fath al-Bari) 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin was asked in Fatawa al-Siyam (p. 466): 
How can we reconcile between the idea that the devils are chained up in Ramadan and the fact the people commit sin? 
He replied: 
“The fact that sin happens in Ramadan does not contradict the report that the devils are chained up in Ramadan, because the fact that they are chained up does not prevent them from moving. Hence it says in the hadith: “And the strong devils are chained up, and they cannot achieve what they usually achieve (at other times).” Narrated by Ahmad, 7857; this hadith was mentioned by al-Albani in Da’if al-Targhib, 586; he said: it is da’if jiddan (very weak).

    it, and ignorance, Allaah has no need of him giving up his food and drink.” 
The phrase “false speech” includes lying, backbiting, spreading slander and 
    bearing false witness, and every kind of speech that is haraam. 
Acting upon it means doing evil and immoral actions. See Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi. 
Ignorance means committing all kinds of sins. This was the view of al-Sindi in 
    Haashiyat Ibn Maajah. 
Al-Haafiz said: 
With regard to the phrase “Allaah has no need of him giving up his food and drink”, Ibn 
    Battaal said: This does not mean that he is to be told to stop fasting, rather it is a warning against false speech and the other things mentioned 
    along with it… this is an indication that (his fast) is not accepted… what is meant is that a fast that is contaminated with falsehood is rejected 
    and that a fast that is free of that is aceepted. 
Ibn al-‘Arabi said: This hadeeth implies that whoever does the things mentioned 
    here will not be rewarded for his fast. What is meant is that the reward for fasting cannot outweigh the sin of false speech and the other things 
    mentioned here. 
What is meant is that all sins have an effect on the fast and thus reduce the 
    reward for fasting. The reward may be cancelled out altogether if there are too many sins. 
So you have to continue to strive against yourself until you give up this evil 
    habit. Every time you sin you have to repent and seek forgiveness, for the one who repents from sin is like one who did not sin at all.

    she has to pay the fidyah – which is a sheep to be slaughtered in Makkah and distributed among the poor living in the Haram – according to the 
    majority of scholars. This ruling applies to everyone who is stopped by an enemy or by sickness etc which prevents him from completing the rituals 
    of his Hajj or ‘Umrah, when he did not make a condition. 
When entering ihraam, the Muslim may stipulate a condition, if he fears that 
    something may prevent him from completing his ‘Umrah or Hajj, such as sickness or fear etc. So after entering ihraam he may say, “If something 
    prevents me (from continuing), I will exit ihraam from that point.” The benefit of this condition is that if something prevents him from 
    completing his ‘Umrah or Hajj, he may then exit his ihraam without offering the fidyah. 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: 
If a person who has entered ihraam for Hajj or ‘Umrah passes the meeqaat without 
    having stipulated a condition, then something happens to him, such as illness etc., that prevents him from completing his pilgrimage, what does he 
    have to do? 
He replied: 
This person is muhsar (prevented) because he did not stipulate a condition then 
    something happened to him that prevented him from continuing. If he can be patient and wait to see if the effects of whatever happened go away so 
    that he can then complete his pilgrimage, then he should wait. If he is not able to do that, then he is muhsar according to the correct opinion, 
    and Allaah says concerning the muhsar (interpretation of the meaning): 
“But if you are prevented (from completing them), sacrifice a Hady (animal, 
    i.e. a sheep, a cow, or a camel) such as you can afford”
[al-Baqarah 2:196]
The correct view is that one may be prevented by an enemy or by something other than an enemy. 
    So he should offer the sacrifice, shave or cut his hair, and exit ihraam. This is the ruling on one who is prevented: he should slaughter his 
    sacrifice in the place where he is prevented, whether that is within the Haram or outside, and he should give the meat to the poor in the place 
    where he is, even if he is outside the Haram. 
If he cannot find anyone around him, it should be taken to the poor of the Haram or to the poor 
    around the Haram or in any of the villages. Then he should shave his head or cut his hair, and exit ihraam. If he cannot offer a sacrifice then he 
    should fast for ten days and then exit ihraam or cut his hair and exit ihraam.

If she had not yet reached puberty, some of the scholars are of the view that you 
    and she do not have to do anything. They said that it is not obligatory for a child to complete or resume whatever he entered ihraam for, because 
    a child is not subject to the obligations of Islam, and because this view is kinder to people, as a child’s guardian may think that ihraam is easy 
    for him, then he finds out that this is not the case.
