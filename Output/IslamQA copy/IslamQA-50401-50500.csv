Is it permissible for her to pray with her underwear on which this discharge has gotten? If it is not permissible, then does she have to repeat her Wudu and change her underwear?","If these discharges come as the result of intimacy, then they are pure, because they are not the waste products of eating and drinking, thus they are not urine. Based on this, she does not have to wash her underwear or change them if these discharges get on them.","Are discharges pure or impure? 


Is Wudu invalidated because of discharges or not?","Praise be to Allah.The discussion on such discharges focuses on two issues: 
Are discharges pure or impure? 
The view of Abu Hanifah and Ahmad, and one of the two views narrated from Ash-Shafi`i – which An-Nawawi classed as correct – is that it is pure. This view was also favoured by Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin, who said in Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti` (1/392): 
“If these discharges come as the result of intimacy, then they are pure, because they are not the waste products of eating and drinking, thus they are not urine. 
The basic principle is that there is no impurity unless there is evidence that something is impure. Because a man is not obliged to wash his penis if he has intercourse with his wife nor to wash his garment if anything gets onto it; if it were impure then the semen, which is pure, would become impure (through contamination with these discharges). (See Al-Majmu`, 1/406 and Al-Mughni, 2/88) 
Based on this, she does not have to wash her underwear or change them if these discharges get on them. 
Is Wudu invalidated because of discharges or not? 
The view of most of the scholars is that this does invalidate Wudu. This is the view favoured by Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him), who said: 
“Anyone who attributes to me the view that this does not invalidate Wudu is not correct. It seems that he understood from my words that it is pure and does not invalidate Wudu.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin, 11/287) 
He (may Allah have mercy on him) also said (11/285): 
With regard to the belief of some women, that (these discharges) do not invalidate Wudu , I do not know of any basis for that except the view of Ibn Hazm. 
But, if a woman experiences this wetness constantly, then she should do Wudu for every prayer after the time for the prayer begins, and it will not matter if this wetness is discharged after that, even if that happens while she is praying. 
Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“If the wetness described happens continually , most of the time, then every woman who experiences that must do Wudu for every prayer when the time begins. This is similar to the case of a woman who suffers from Istihadah (irregular vaginal bleeding outside menses) or one who suffers from urinary incontinence .  
But if this wetness only happens sometimes, and is not ongoing, then it comes under the same rulings as urine – when it happens it invalidates purity, even during the prayer.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn Baz, 10/130)

Does blood donation break your fast?","Praise be to Allah.Does a blood test break your fast?
A blood test does not affect the fast because it is a little and does not make the fasting person weak. 
Shaykh Ibn Baz was asked about the ruling on a person who has blood taken when he is fasting in Ramadan for the purpose of testing.
He replied: 
“A test of this nature does not affect the fast, rather it is excused, because it is something needed, and it is not like the things that are known to break the fast according to Shari’ah.” (Majmu’ Fatawa Ibn Baz, 15/274) 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin was asked in Fatawa Arkan al-Islam, p. 478, about the ruling on a fasting person having a blood test, and whether that breaks the fast. 
He replied: 
“The fasting person does not break the fast by having blood taken for a test. If the doctor needs to take blood from the patient to test it, this does not break the fast, because it is a small amount of blood and it does not affect the body in the way that cupping does. 
The basic principle is that the fast remains valid and cannot be spoiled except by things for which there is Shar’i evidence that they affect the fast. In this case there is no evidence that the fasting person breaks his fast because of this small amount of blood. 
Does blood donation break your fast?
With regard to taking a large amount of blood from a fasting person in order to donate it to a person who needs it, for example, then if a large amount of blood is taken which has the same effect on the body as cupping, this does break the fast.
Based on this, if the fast is obligatory then it is not permissible for anyone to donate a large amount of blood to anyone, unless the person who is to receive that blood is in dire need and cannot wait until after the sun sets, and the doctors have decided that the blood of this fasting person will benefit him and will meet his immediate need for it. 
In this case, there is nothing wrong with donating blood, and he may break his fast and eat and drink in order to regain his strength, and he should make up this day when he broke his fast.”

I asked them for permission to take the things to the musalla (prayer room) of the school where I am studying. Is it permissible to do that?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Yes, it is permissible to do that, in sha Allaah. 
Ibn Qudaamah said: If there is anything left over from the mats and adornments of the mosque that is not needed, it is permissible to put them in another mosque, or to give them in charity to poor neighbours and others. 
Ahmad said concerning a case where mosque had been built and some wood was left over: Let it be used to help another mosque, or words to that effect. 
Al-Marwadhi said: I asked Abu ‘Abd-Allaah about pipes of the mosque, if there is anything left over, or if any wood is left over. He said: Give it in charity. Al-Mughni, 6/219-220. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
Yes, it is permissible to move a waqf if that serves a greater interest. If something is no longer needed in a mosque, such as furnishings or shelves etc, we may move the items themselves to another mosque if possible, otherwise we may sell these things and spend the money earned on the mosque. If it belongs to the Ministry of Awqaaf, then the people in authority are the ones who should decide what is to be done.

Although a musalla does not come under exactly the same rulings as the mosque, it is like a mosque to some extent, so moving furnishings to a musalla should take priority over giving them in charity to the poor. And Allaah knows best.

50412,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50412,He is living in Germany – should he fast with the European Islamic Society or with Saudi?,"We are living in Germany and the problem is that the imam of one mosque says “We will fast with Saudi” but in another mosque they said, “We will fast following the European Islamic Society which supposed to have undertaken the mission to watch for the moon.” What is your opinion? May Allaah reward you with good?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.If the 
    European Islamic Society depends on sighting the moon, then it is better for 
    you to follow them with regard to starting and ending the fast. 
There is an 
    ancient and well known difference of scholarly opinion concerning this 
    matter – should each land have its own sighting or should everyone follow 
    those who see the moon even if the sightings differ from one country to 
    another? This difference of opinion is permissible and is based on ijtihaad, 
    and there is no sin on anyone if he follows one of these two opinions, 
    according to the evidence that becomes clear to him. Perhaps the more 
    correct view is that the difference in sightings is relevant in this issue. 
    We have explained the evidence for this view in the answer to question no. 
    50487. 
Among the 
    evidence that supports that is the report narrated by Muslim (1819) from 
    Kurayb, that Umm al-Fadl bint al-Haarith sent him to Mu’aawiyah in Syria. He 
    said: I came to Syria and did her errand, then the new moon of Ramadaan came 
    when I was in Syria, and I saw the new moon on Thursday night. Then I came 
    to Madeenah at the end of the month and ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah 
    be pleased with him) asked me about the new moon. He said: “When did you see 
    the new moon?” I said: “We saw it on Thursday night.” He said: “Did you see 
    it?” I said: “Yes, and the people saw it, and they fasted, and Mu’aawiyah 
    fasted.” He said: “But we saw it on Friday night, and we will carry on 
    fasting until we complete thirty days or we see it.” I said: “Is not the 
    sighting and fasting of Mu’aawiyah sufficient for you?” He said: “No; that 
    is what the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) enjoined upon us.” 
This 
    indicates that when lands are far apart, each land has its own sighting, and 
    it is not obligatory for everyone to fast when one land sees the moon.

50430,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50430,Brownish discharge before one becomes pure is regarded as part of the period,"If after six days of menstruation a woman notices some light brown discharge of some sort, is that regarded as menstruation or not?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.If this brownish discharge that the woman sees comes before she sees that she is pure (i.e., seeing a white discharge which indicates that the period is over), then it is part of the period. If it comes after she sees that she is pure, then it is not part of the period and does not affect her praying and fasting. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) says in his essay al-Dima’ al-Tabee’iyyah li’l-Nisa’ (p. 19) concerning discharges that may interrupt the period: 
The third kind is yellowish or brownish discharge, where a woman sees yellowish blood like blood from a wound, or brownish, somewhere between yellow and black. If this happens during the period or following on from it, before the woman becomes pure, then it is part of the period and comes under the rulings on menstruation. If it comes after she becomes pure, then it is not menstruation, because Umm ‘Atiyyah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “We used not to regard the brownish or yellowish discharge that comes after a woman becomes pure as being anything that mattered.” Narrated by Abu Dawood with a saheeh isnaad. 
He also said in Fatawa Arkaan al-Islam (p. 258): 
The basic principle is that if a woman becomes pure and her period is over for certain – which means that she sees the white discharge that is known to women – then any brownish or yellowish discharge or spotting or wetness that comes after she has become pure is not menstruation, so it does not prevent her from praying or fasting, and it does not prevent a man from having intercourse with his wife, because it is not menstruation. 
But she should not rush until she has seen that she is pure, because some women, when the bleeding lessens, rush and do ghusl before seeing that the period is over (the white discharge mentioned above). Hence the women of the Sahaabah used to send the cotton with yellowish discharge to the mother of the Believers ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), and she would tell them: “Do not hasten until you see the white discharge.”.",Islam Q&A
50452,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50452,Ruling on one who has intercourse with his wife in her back passage during the day in Ramadan,"In Ramadan I was newly married, and I could not keep away from my wife. I used to be intimate with her during the day in Ramadan without having intercourse, but I feel that even though I was trying to be very careful I penetrated the back passage and ejaculated. What is the ruling on that?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Having intercourse with one’s wife in her back passage is a major sin, which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) mentioned in conjunction with going to fortunetellers, and he described it as kufr. He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever has intercourse with a menstruating women, or with a woman in her back passage, or goes to a fortuneteller, has disbelieved in that which was revealed to Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 135; Abu Dawood, 3904; Ibn Maajah, 639. classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Targheeb, 2433. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed the one who has intercourse with a woman in her back passage and said: “Cursed be the one who has intercourse with his wife in her back passage.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2162; classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Targheeb, 2432. 
These ahaadeeth indicate that it is haraam to have intercourse with a woman in her back passage. This is an action which goes against the fitrah (sound human nature) and incurs the wrath and anger of Allah, and is also a cause of disease. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about what a man who has had intercourse with his wife in her back passage should do. Has this been permitted by any of the scholars? 
He replied: 
, the Lord of the Worlds. Intercourse in the back passage is forbidden according to the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and according to all the leaders and imams of the Muslims, including the Sahaabah, the Taabi’een and others. Allah says in His Book (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Your wives are a tilth for you, so go to your tilth (i.e., have sexual relations with your wives in any manner as long as it is in the vagina and not in the anus) when or how you will, and send (good deeds, or ask Allah to bestow upon you pious offspring) for your ownselves beforehand”
[al-Baqarah 2:223]
And it is narrated in al-Saheehayn that the Jews used to say that if a man had intercourse with his wife in her vagina from behind, the child would be born with a squint. The Muslims asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about that, then this verse was revealed (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Your wives are a tilth for you, so go to your tilth (i.e., have sexual relations with your wives in any manner as long as it is in the vagina and not in the anus) when or how you will, and send (good deeds, or ask Allah to bestow upon you pious offspring) for your ownselves beforehand”
[al-Baqarah 2:223]
The word harth (translated here as tilth) refers to the place where one sews seed, and the seed for a child is planted in the vagina, not in the anus. 
Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 32/267 
See also the answer to question no. 1103, where the ruling on having intercourse with a woman in her back passage and the bad psychological and physical effects of that are discussed. 
See also the answer to question no. 6792, which discusses the ruling along with the evidence for it. 
In the answer to question no. 49614 we have explained that a husband may be intimate with his wife whilst he is fasting, so long as he does not have intercourse or ejaculate; intercourse with one’s wife in her vagina is haraam during the day in Ramadan, so how about if he has intercourse in the back passage and ejaculates?! 
Secondly: 
With regard to the effect on the fast you were observing at the time you did what you did: the fast is undoubtedly invalid, but you must still refrain from eating and drinking for the rest of the day. The majority of scholars stated that the day must be made up, as well as offering expiation for having intercourse in the wife’s back passage, regardless of whether he ejaculated or not. 
This ruling also applies to your wife – she must also make up that fast and offer expiation, because it seems that she was a willing participant. 
Ibn Qudaamah said: 
It makes no difference if one has intercourse in the front or back passage of a male or a female. This is the view of al-Shaafa’i…. Because he broke the Ramadan fast by having intercourse so he must offer expiation. 
From al-Mughni, 3/27. 
In the answer to question no. 38023 it says: 
Whoever has intercourse during the day in Ramadan deliberately and of his or her own free will, in which the two circumcised parts meet and the tip of the penis disappears in either of the two passages, has invalidated his fast, whether he ejaculates or not. He has to repent, complete that day (i.e., not eat or drink until sunset), make up that day’s fast later on and offer a severe expiation. 
The Muslim should strive to fear Allah and avoid that which He has forbidden, especially during this month which Allah has enjoined us to fast so that we might attain piety. Allah says: 
“O you who believe! Observing As-Sawm (the fasting) is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, that you may become Al-Muttaqoon (the pious” [al-Baqarah 2:183]
And Allah knows best.",Islam Q&A
50487,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50487,Why are the Muslims not united in their fasting?,Why are the Muslims not united in their fasting even though there is only one new moon for Ramadan? In the past there was the excuse of there being no media or means of communication.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
The most likely reason for the differences in the start of the fast from one country to another is the difference in sighting the new moon. Such differences are well known and it makes sense that there are such differences. 
Based on this, it is not possible to expect all the Muslims to start fasting at the same time, because this would mean that some of them were starting to fast before the new moon had been sighted and even before it had appeared. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about those who call for the ummah to be united in fasting and for the moon sighting to be based on its sighting in Makkah. He said: 
This is impossible from an astronomical point of view, because the sighting of the new moon, as Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said, differs, according to the scientists who are well-versed in this field. Because it differs, then each country should have its own ruling, according to the reports and according to science. 
The evidence from reports is the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So whoever of you sights (the crescent on the first night of) the month (of Ramadan i.e. is present at his home), he must observe Sawm (fasts) that month”
[al-Baqarah 2:185]
If it so happens that people in a remote region of the world do not see the new moon whereas the people of Makkah do see it, then how can the words of this verse apply to those who have not seen the new moon? The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Fast when you see it and stop fasting when you see it.” (Agreed upon). So if the people of Makkah, for example, see it, then how can we expect the people of Pakistan and countries further east to start fasting, when we know that that the new moon has not yet appeared in their region, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) connected the start of fasting to the sighting of the moon?
 The scientific evidence is the correct analogy which we cannot contradict. We know that dawn appears in eastern regions of the earth before it appears in western regions, so if dawn has appeared in eastern regions, do we have to stop eating even though it is still night where we are? The answer is no. If the sun has set in eastern regions but it is still day where we are, is it permissible for us to break our fast? The answer is no. And the new moon is exactly like the sun, except that the timing of the new moon is monthly and the timing of the sun is daily.  The One Who said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and eat and drink until the white thread (light) of dawn appears to you distinct from the black thread (darkness of night), then complete your Sawm (fast) till the nightfall”
[al-Baqarah 2:187] is also the One Who said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So whoever of you sights (the crescent on the first night of) the month (of Ramadan i.e. is present at his home), he must observe Sawm (fasts) that month”
[al-Baqarah 2:185]
So the evidence of both the texts and science indicates that we should establish a separate ruling for each place when it comes to starting and ending the fast, and this should be connected to the physical sign which Allah has described in His Book and which His Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) established in his Sunnah, namely the sighting of the moon and the sighting of the sun or dawn. 
End quote from Fatawa Arkaan al-Islam, p. 451. 
And he said, explaining this analogy and supporting the argument of those who say that there should be different moon sightings: 
They say that the monthly timings should be like the daily sightings. Just as different countries vary in the start and end of the fast each day, so too they must differ in the start and end of the month-long fast. The difference in daily timings is well known according to Muslim consensus; those who are in the east start fasting before those who are in the west, and they also break the fast first. 
If we accept the differences in sighting with regard to daily timings, then we should also accept it with regard to the month. 
No one can say that the verse “and eat and drink until the white thread (light) of dawn appears to you distinct from the black thread (darkness of night), then complete your Sawm (fast) till the nightfall” and the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) “When the night has come from here and the day has departed from here and the sun has set, then the faster may break his fast” are general in meaning and apply to all the Muslims in every region. 
The same applies to the verse “So whoever of you sights (the crescent on the first night of) the month (of Ramadan i.e. is present at his home), he must observe Sawm (fasts) that month” and the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) “When you see it fast and when you see it stop fasting.”
As you see, this opinion is very strong, and the analogy is sound, the analogy between the monthly timing and the daily timing. 
End quote from Fatawa Ramadan, compiled by Ashraf ‘Abd al-Maqsood, p. 104 
The Council of Senior Scholars issued an important statement on this topic, the text of which is as follows: 
Firstly: The difference in moon sighting is something which is well known, and there is no difference among the scholars concerning this. Rather the difference of scholarly opinion has to do with whether the difference in moon sighting matters or not. 
Secondly: The issue of whether the difference in moon sighting matters or not is a theoretical matter in which there is room for ijtihaad. Even people of great knowledge and piety differed concerning this matter. This is a type of difference which is acceptable, where the one who makes ijtihaad and gets it right will have two rewards, one for his ijtihaad and the other for getting it right, and the one who gets it wrong will be rewarded for his ijtihaad. 
The scholars differed concerning this matter and there are two points of view. One is that the difference in moon sighting matters and the other is that it does not matter. Each group quotes evidence from the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and sometimes they quote the same text, such as when they both quote the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“They ask you (O Muhammad) about the new moons. Say: These are signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the pilgrimage” [al-Baqarah 2:189]
and the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “Fast when you see it and stop fasting when you see it.”
 That is because of different understandings of the texts, and different ways in which each group derives evidence from them. 
Based on the considerations that the Council has seen and examined, and based on the fact that the difference of opinion on this matter does not have any effect that may lead to undesirable consequences, since this religion appeared fourteen centuries ago and we do not know of any period during which the ummah was united in moon sighting, the members of the Council of Senior Scholars think that matters should be left as they are and that this subject should not be stirred up. Each Islamic state should have the right to choose whichever opinion it wishes, based on the suggestions of its own scholars, because each view has its evidence and proofs. 
Thirdly: The Council has studied the issue of proving the new moon by means of calculation, and what has been narrated in the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and they have studied the comments of the scholars on this matter. They have decided unanimously that astronomical calculations carry no weight in determining the new moon with regard to Islamic matters, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Fast when you see it and stop fasting when you see it.” And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not fast until you see it, and do not stop fasting until you see it.” And because of other evidence to that effect.
