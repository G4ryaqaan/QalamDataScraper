40401,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/40401,Is the wife of one’s son through breastfeeding a mahram?,I have a son through breastfeeding who was breastfed by my wife. Am I a mahram for his wife?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The wife of a son of one’s loins is a mahram to his father, 
    because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Forbidden to you (for marriage) are… the wives of your 
    sons who (spring) from your own loins”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:23]

    If a man has a son who is married to a woman, his father 
    becomes a mahram to her, and he may travel with her, be alone with her, look 
    at her face, and so on. With regard to his son through breastfeeding, most 
    of the scholars are of the view that he is like a son from his own loins, 
    but Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah rejected that and said: Breastfeeding does 
    not affect the in-law relationship; the wife of a son through breastfeeding 
    is a non-mahram to the father, so she should not uncover in front of him and 
    she should not be alone with him and he may not travel with her, because she 
    is a stranger (non-mahram) to him. Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning):

    “Forbidden to you (for marriage) are… the wives of your 
    sons who (spring) from your own loins”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:23]
And the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “What becomes mahram 
    (forbidden for marriage) through breastfeeding is that which become mahram 
    through blood ties.”
A son’s wife is not a 
    mahram to his father because of blood ties but rather through marriage. 
    There is no blood tie between his father and her, rather she is his mahram 
    through marriage. This is the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, 
    and this is what I think is correct.","Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him); Liqaa’aat al-baab il-Maftooh, 529"
40405,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/40405,She is confused about women’s rights in Islam,"I am confused. All my life I interacted with others on the basis that I am a human being before being female and the slave woman of Allah as much as I could, and that based on this, whoever does good, whether male or female, will be rewarded, and whoever commits sin will bear the burden of sin. But after I got married I was surprised by some rulings which treat me as if I am not human, because they treat me as if I am only an object for the enjoyment of the man, such as the fact that the angels will curse me if I refuse intimacy under any circumstances, at the time when he is under no such burden if he refuses to have intercourse with his wife even if he does that to cause her harm. So he gets the reward of doing charity if he has intercourse with her and enjoys intimacy with her, and she will not have any reward, even if she responds unwillingly. If he upsets me and humiliates me in front of people, I have to make up with him and try to please him, otherwise the angels will curse me. And of course I have no right to differ with his opinion or to argue with him, and if I lose my temper I am not forgiven. And, as you have stated in a fatwa, the reward for praying in congregation is only for men and not for women. Is this what Allaah has prescribed for us? Is this the fate of the Muslim woman if she does well and does what is required of her? If she avoids sin, she does not attain any virtue and if she falls short she is one of those who are cursed and expelled from the mercy of Allaah, and do I and the accursed Iblees become the same? 
I hope that you will pay attention to this question, because I am having doubts about my religion. If this is what Allah has prescribed then we hear and obey and there is no power and no strength except with Allah.",,,"Praise be to Allah.We are shocked by what the sister has mentioned in her question, that is not part of the religion of Allah but she is attributing to it, and her belief in rulings for which Allah has not sent down any authority, such as her saying that “after I got married I was surprised by some rulings which treat me as if I am not human, because they treat me as if I am only an object for the enjoyment of the man”!  
We will respond by noting the following points: 
Firstly: 
Allah has honoured women greatly. He honours them as daughters, mothers and wives, and gives them rights and virtues, and enjoins good treatment in ways that are not shared by men in many cases. 
Islam does not deny woman’s humanity. Rather it gives her her rights and holds her in high esteem. Women were treated as chattels and objects before Allah honoured mankind with Islam. Women would be inherited like goods and chattels, and could be left suspended, being neither married nor divorced. A woman would have to wait for a year after her husband’s death, neither washing nor going out of the house, until birds and animals would die from her foul smell! Women were not allowed to inherit, let alone the fact that they could be buried alive, and many other things. 
Then Islam came and forbade burying females alive; it regarded that as murder, which is a major sin. It forbade leaving women suspended as a result of vows or making one's wife haram by means of zihaar [a jaahili form of divorce in which the husband said to his wife, ‘You are to me as my mother’s back’; intimacy thus became forbidden, but the woman was not divorced completely and was not free to enter into a new marriage - Translator]. Islam gave women their share of inheritance, and stipulated an ‘iddah of four months and ten days after the death of her husband, during which she could bathe, change her clothes and see other women and her mahrams. It allowed women to buy, sell and own property, and encouraged them to seek knowledge and call people to Allah. It commanded that women should be honoured as wives and as mothers, and made the mother’s rights three times greater than those of the father. And there are many other ways in which Islam honoured women, which we have no room to discuss in detail here; rather we just wanted to remind you of this. Please also see the answer to question no. 21010 for more information. 
Secondly: 
The sister says in her question: “such as the fact that the angels will curse me if I refuse intimacy under any circumstances”. 
This is not correct. Rather the angels do not curse the wife who refuses to share her husband’s bed unless she has no valid excuse. If she has an excuse – such as being sick, or menstruating, or bleeding following childbirth (nifaas), or observing an obligatory fast, then she is not cursed, rather her husband who calls her to bed is sinning if he insists on calling her, or forces her when he knows of her situation. 
In question no. 33597 of this site it says: 
A woman does not have the right to refuse her husband, rather she must respond to his request every time he calls her, so long as that will not harm her or keep her from doing something that is obligatory.  
In question no. 9602 it says: 
Ibn Hazm said: 
It is obligatory on slave women and free women alike not to refuse their masters or husbands if they call them, so long as the woman who is called is not menstruating or sick in such a way that intercourse will be harmful to her, or observing an obligatory fast. If she refuses with no excuse, then she is cursed. 
Al-Muhalla, 10/40 
This curse is limited to cases where the husband remains angry with her all night. But if he calls her and she refuses, then he foregoes his right, then she is not cursed. 
Thirdly: 
The sister says in her question, “at the time when he is under no such burden if he refuses to have intercourse with his wife even if he does that to cause her harm.” This also is not correct. Islam forbids harming others, which includes a husband harming his wife by preventing her from breastfeeding her child, or denying her her right to intercourse and pleasure. 
It says in the answer to question no. 10680 – in the context of discussing the wife’s rights over her husband:
Not harming one’s wife. 
This is one of the basic principles of Islam. Because harming others is haram in the case of strangers, it is even more so in the case of harming one’s wife.
It was narrated from ‘Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ruled, “There should be no harming nor reciprocating harm.” (Narrated by Ibn Maajah,, 2340)
This hadith was classed as saheeh by Imaam Ahmad, al-Haakim, Ibn al-Salaah and others. See Khalaasat al-Badr al-Muneer, 2/438.
It says in the answer to question no. 5971:  
It is not permissible for a man to forsake his wife and thus harm her, except in the case of nushooz (rebellion) and disobedience. But he is not committing a sin if he does not lie with her without intending to harm her, because the need is his and depends on his desire and he cannot control his desire at will. If he forsakes her, then he is a sinner because there should be no harming or reciprocating harm. And Allah knows best. 
Fourthly: 
The sister says in her question, “So he gets the reward of doing charity if he has intercourse with her and enjoys intimacy with her, and she will not have any reward, even if she responds unwillingly” 
This is also not correct. Rather the wife will be rewarded for intercourse in two ways: 
1 – Because she is the twin half of man in rulings and rewards, except those where an exception is stated in the texts. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So their Lord accepted of them (their supplication and answered them), Never will I allow to be lost the work of any of you, be he male or female. You are (members) one of another, so those who emigrated and were driven out from their homes, and suffered harm in My Cause, and who fought, and were killed (in My Cause), verily, I will expiate from them their evil deeds and admit them into Gardens under which rivers flow (in Paradise); a reward from Allah, and with Allah is the best of rewards” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:195]
2 – It is the cause of the husband being rewarded, and whoever is the cause of another person being rewarded will share in the reward without that detracting from his or her reward in the slightest.
It was narrated from Abu Dharr that some people from among the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “O Messenger of Allah, the rich people will get more reward. They pray as we pray, and they fast as we fast, but they give in charity from their excess wealth.” He said, “Has not Allah given you things with which you can give charity? Every tasbeehah (saying ‘Subhaan Allah (Glory be to Allah)’) is a charity. Every Takbeerah (saying ‘Allahu akbar (Allah is Most Great)’) is a charity. Every Tahmeedah (saying ‘al-hamdu-Lillaah (praise be to Allah)’ is a charity. Every Tahleelah (saying ‘Laa ilaaha ill-Allah (there is no god but Allah)’) is a charity. Enjoining what is good is a charity. Forbidding what is evil is a charity. Having intercourse (with one’s wife) is a charity.” They said, “O Messenger of Allah, if one of us fulfils his desire, is there reward in that?” He said, “Do you not see that if he does it in a haram way he will have the burden of sin? So if he does it in a halaal way, he will have a reward for that.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1006)
So the wife will be rewarded just as her husband will, just as she is sinning if she fulfils her desires in a way that is haram, just as is the case with the husband.
Imaam al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
“The phrase, ‘Having intercourse is a charity’ – the word bud’ (translated here as ‘having intercourse’) may mean intercourse, or it may refer to the private part itself…
This indicates that permissible actions may become acts of worship, if there is a sincere intention. Intercourse may be an act of worship if the intention behind it is to fulfil the rights of one's wife, to treat her kindly as enjoined by Allah, to seek a righteous child, to keep oneself or one’s wife chaste, to prevent both partners from looking towards or thinking of haram things, and other good intentions
Fifthly: 
The sister says in her question: “If he upsets me and humiliates me in front of people, I have to make up with him and try to please him, otherwise the angels will curse me”. 
This also is not correct. The curse applies in the case of a woman who refuses to come to her husband’s bed with no excuse, when her husband stays angry with her all night – as explained above –  
But if the husband humiliates her, then he is undoubtedly sinning by doing that, and sharee’ah allows her to answer him back in a manner that befits his wrongdoing. 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And indeed whosoever takes revenge after he has suffered wrong, for such there is no way (of blame) against them” [Al-Shoora 42:41]
i.e., there is no sin on them.   
The word man (whosoever) here is general in meaning and includes women too. 
Or if she is patient in bearing harsh words and mistreatment, seeking reward with Allah, she will earn a more complete and better reward. 
So what he must do is to make up with her and try to please her, not the other way round. If a person does wrong, in order for his repentance to be complete he must try to please the one who has been wronged, with apologies and kind words. 
Sixthly: 
The sister says: “And of course I have no right to differ with his opinion or to argue with him, and if I lose my temper I am not forgiven.”  
This is not correct. It is permissible for a women to argue with her husband and to have a different opinion, but she does not have the right to refuse to do what he tells her to do – even if she objects to it – so long as he does not tell her to commit sin, because there is no obedience to anyone if it involves disobedience towards the Creator. This is part of the qiwaamah (role of protector and maintainer) that Allah has given to the husband in return for the obligation to spend on his wife, protect her and take care of her. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means” [Al-Nisa’ 4:34]
It is narrated that the women of the Sahaabah used to argue and debate with them, and indeed this is the way in which the Mothers of the Believers [i.e., the Prophet’s wives] used to act with our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), as ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “We Quraysh used to control our women, but when we came to the Ansaar we found that they were a people who were controlled by their women. So our women started to adopt the ways of the Ansaari women. I got angry with my wife and she argued with me and I did not like her arguing with me. She said, ‘Why do you object to me arguing with you? By Allah, the wives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) argue with him…’” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 4895; Muslim, 1479. 
Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said – discussing the lessons to be learned from this hadith – 
“This indicates that being harsh with women is something blameworthy, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) adopted the way of the Ansaar with their women and forsook the way of his people.”""(Fath al-Baari, 9/291)
With regard to what the sister mentioned about not being forgiven for any loss of temper or irritation on her part, this is not right at all, because there are some kinds of irritation for which a person will not be taken to task if he does not speak of them or act upon them, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah will forgive my ummah for that which crosses their minds, so long as they do not speak of it or act upon it.” And there are some which a person cannot help at all, because of intense anger, etc, which is beyond his or her control. At the end of Soorat al-Baqarah is mentioned the du’aa’ of the believers (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Our Lord! Put not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear” [Al-Baqarah 2:286]
and it is proven in the Sunnah that Allah has answered this du’aa’ and said, “I will do that.” 
Seventhly: 
The sister says in her question: “as you have stated in a fatwa that the reward for praying in congregation is only for men and not for women”.  
This also is not correct. Rather what we said – based on the ahaadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) – is that the twenty-seven-fold reward is for men only, because they are the ones for whom prayer in congregation is enjoined, not women. Prayer in congregation is mustahabb for women, but we cannot be certain that women will get the twenty-seven-fold reward. It is permissible for women to attend the prayers in the mosque, and it is not permissible for men to forbid them to go. If they go and pray with (the men), they will have a share of the reward for praying in congregation. 
Nevertheless, based on the saheeh ahaadeeth, if a woman prays in her house, she is doing that which is better for her than the reward for praying in the mosque. 
It was narrated from Ibn ‘Umar that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not prevent your women from coming to the mosques, although their houses are better for them.”
Narrated by Abu Dawood, 567; Ahmad, 5445 – this version narrated by Ahmad. 
‘Abd al-‘Azeem Abaadi said: 
“Their houses are better for them” means that their praying in their houses is better for them than praying in the mosques, if only they knew that, but they do not know that, so they ask to go out to the mosques and think that the reward for going to the mosque is greater. The reason why their praying in their houses is better is because they are safer from fitnah (temptation). This ruling is even more necessary because of the tabarruj (wanton display) and adornment that have become prevalent among women.""(‘Awn al-Ma’bood, 2/193). 
Eighthly: 
The sister says in her question: “Is this the fate of the Muslim woman if she does well and does what is required of her? If she avoids sin, she does not attain any virtue and if she falls short she is one of those who are cursed and expelled from the mercy of Allah, and do I and the accursed Iblees become the same?”! 
This is thinking badly of Allah, and what you say is not correct at all. 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Whoever works righteousness, whether male or female, while he (or she) is a true believer (of Islamic monotheism) verily, to him We will give a good life (in this world with respect, contentment and lawful provision), and We shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion to the best of what they used to do (i.e., Paradise in the Hereafter).” [Al-Nahl 16:97]
“So their Lord accepted of them (their supplication and answered them), Never will I allow to be lost the work of any of you, be he male or female. You are (members) one of another, so those who emigrated and were driven out from their homes, and suffered harm in My Cause, and who fought, and were killed (in My Cause), verily, I will expiate from them their evil deeds and admit them into Gardens under which rivers flow (in Paradise); a reward from Allah, and with Allah is the best of rewards” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:195]
“Verily, the Muslims (those who submit to Allah in Islam) men and women, the believers men and women (who believe in Islamic Monotheism), the men and the women who are obedient (to Allah), the men and women who are truthful (in their speech and deeds), the men and the women who are patient (in performing all the duties which Allah has ordered and in abstaining from all that Allah has forbidden), the men and the women who are humble (before their Lord -- Allah), the men and the women who give Sadaqaat (i.e. Zakaah and alms), the men and the women who observe Sawm (fast) (the obligatory fasting during the month of Ramadaan, and the optional Nawafil fasting), the men and the women who guard their chastity (from illegal sexual acts) and the men and the women who remember Allah much with their hearts and tongues. Allah has prepared for them forgiveness and a great reward (i.e. Paradise)” [Al-Ahzaab 33:35]
With regard to the sister’s saying that if she falls short, she and Iblees would be the same, this is an exaggeration and there is no need for this; and it is an unacceptable comparison, because the curse of Allah to Iblees is the eternal curse for which no repentance will be accepted, and it cannot be compared to the curse that applies in the case of a Muslim who believes in Allah alone and submits to Him, but commits some major sins. 
The clear verses and words that we have quoted are sufficient to explain the error of what you say. We ask Allah to help you to understand Islam properly and to make you steadfast in adhering to goodness and true guidance. 
At the end of this response, we should not forget to praise our sister for her frankness in asking about the doubts about some Islamic matters that the Shaytaan has thrown into her heart which, if she had kept them to herself, could have spoiled her religious commitment and generated waswaas (whispers from the Shaytaan) which could have caused a great deal of trouble in her life. Asking such questions dispels confusion and dispels doubt from one’s heart. 
But when asking such questions, that should be done with more in a more appropriate manner, when asking about the wisdom of Allah in what He prescribes, and the questioner should avoid everything that may be taken as objecting to the rulings, because the human mind is incapable of comprehending the greatness of Allah’s wisdom and the vastness of His bounty towards His creation. 
We also appreciate our sister’s acceptance of and submission to the laws of Allah, as she says, “If this is what Allah has prescribed then we hear and obey”. This is how the believer should be. 
We ask Allah to make us steadfast in adhering to His religion, and to guide us.

Moreover the banks are riba-based institutions and it is not permissible to cooperate with them by either buying or selling, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Help you one another in Al‑Birr and At‑Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allaah. Verily, Allaah is Severe in punishment”
[al-Maa'idah 5:2]
And it was proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed the one who consumes riba, the one to whom it is given, the one who writes it down and the two who witness it, and he said they are all the same. Narrated by Imam Muslim. 
All that you are entitled to is your capital. 
My advice to you and to other Muslims is to beware of all riba-based transactions and to warn against them, and to repent to Allaah from any such transactions you may have engaged in in the past, because riba-based transactions are a kind of war against Allaah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and are one of the causes of the wrath and punishment of Allaah, and He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Those who eat Ribaa will not stand (on the Day of Resurrection) except like the standing of a person beaten by Shaytaan (Satan) leading him to insanity. That is because they say: ‘Trading is only like Ribaa,’ whereas Allaah has permitted trading and forbidden Ribaa. So whosoever receives an admonition from his Lord and stops eating Ribaa, shall not be punished for the past; his case is for Allaah (to judge); but whoever returns (to Ribaa), such are the dwellers of the Fire — they will abide therein”
[al-Baqarah 2:275]
And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Be afraid of Allaah and give up what remains (due to you) from Ribaa (from now onward) if you are (really) believers.
279. And if you do not do it, then take a notice of war from Allaah and His Messenger but if you repent, you shall have your capital sums. Deal not unjustly (by asking more than your capital sums), and you shall not be dealt with unjustly (by receiving less than your capital sums)”

But one day he insulted me in all kinds of ways and made me cry and get angry. So I said to him, “You are to me like my brother, you are to me like my brother’s back.”

What is the kafarah (expiation) that I have to offer?","If a wife tells her husband ‘You are prohibited to me like my brother’ etc., this is not Dhihar, rather it is an expiable oath.

“O you who believe! Let not a group scoff at another group, it may be that the latter are better than the former. Nor let (some) women scoff at other women, it may be that the latter are better than the former. Nor defame one another, nor insult one another by nicknames. How bad is it to insult one’s brother after having faith [i.e. to call your Muslim brother (a faithful believer) as: `O sinner’, or `O wicked’]. And whosoever does not repent, then such are indeed Zalimoon (wrongdoers).” [Al-Hujurat 49:11] 
The husband is obliged to treat his wife kindly. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“... and live with them honourably.” [An-Nisa’ 4:19] 
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of you are those who are best to their wives, and I am the best of you to my wives.” [At-Tirmidhi]
Our advice to you is to continue to be patient and put up with your husband’s mistreatment, and pray for him to be guided, and keep reminding him of his duties. 
With regard to your telling him, “You are prohibited to me like my brother,” etc., this is not Dhihar, rather it is an expiable oath. Dhihar is done by a man to his wife, not vice versa. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Those among you who make their wives unlawful to them by Dhihar (i.e., by saying to them `You are like my mother’s back’)…” [Al-Mujadalah 58:2] 
Shaykh Muhammad As-Salih Al-`Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: 
My wife always says to me, “You are my husband, you are my brother, you are my father, you are everything to me in this world.” Do these words make me prohibited (unlawful) to her or not? 
He replied: 
“These words do not make her prohibited for you, because what she means by saying “You are my father and brother,” etc. is that you are like her father and brother in love and care. She does not intend to make you a Mahram like her father and brother.  
Even if we were to assume that she does mean that, you are not prohibited for her, because Dhihar cannot be given by women to their husbands, rather it is something given by men to their wives. Hence if a woman tries to give her husband Dhihar by saying to him, “You are to me like my father’s back” or “my brother’s back” etc., this is not Dhihar, but it comes under the ruling of oaths, in the sense that it is not permissible for her to allow him to be intimate with her unless she offers expiation for breaking a vow. If she wishes, she can offer the expiation before she allows him to be intimate with her, or if she wishes she may do so afterwards. 
The expiation for breaking a vow is to feed or clothe ten poor persons, or to free a slave. If the person cannot do any of these things, then he or she must fast for three days.” (Fatawa Al-Mar’ah Al-Muslimah)

40461,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/40461,"He owes many expiations for breaking oaths (kafaarat yameen), and he does not know how to do it","I owe many expiations for breaking oaths, but when I wanted to offer this expiation, I did not know how to do it. There are no poor or needy people. Is it permissible for me to offer this expiation in the form of cash? How much should I give to each poor person? Is it permissible for me to give it to charities supporting the mujaahideen?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
      Firstly: 

    Kafaarat yameen (expiation for breaking an oath) means 
    freeing a believing slave, or feeding or clothing ten poor people. Whoever 
    cannot do that must fast for three days. The basis for that is the verse in 
    which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Allaah will not punish you for what is unintentional in 
    your oaths, but He will punish you for your deliberate oaths; for its 
    expiation (a deliberate oath) feed ten Masaakeen (poor persons), on a scale 
    of the average of that with which you feed your own families, or clothe them 
    or manumit a slave. But whosoever cannot afford (that), then he should fast 
    for three days. That is the expiation for the oaths when you have sworn”

    [al-Maa’idah 5:89]

    Secondly: 
If a person 
    swears many oaths before breaking the oath, and the thing sworn about was 
    the same, then he only has to offer expiation once. But if he swore many 
    oaths about different things, then he has to offer expiation for each oath. 

    Thirdly: 

    Kafaarat al-yameen must be given to the poor, as stated by 
    Allaah. There is no reason why it cannot be given to the mujaahideen who are 
    fighting for the sake of Allaah, because Allaah has mentioned them among 
    those who may be given zakaah, especially if there are no poor or needy 
    people to whom it may be given. 

    Fourthly: 

    It is not permissible to pay cash instead of offering 
    kafaarat al-yameen, because that is going against the text. Your Lord is not 
    forgetful and He did not state that cash may be given instead of the 
    expiations mentioned in the text.","From Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 23/27"
40468,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/40468,Is it permissible for him to take the money left over by the students after a trip because he was not paid anything for supervising?,"I am the manager of classes for Qur’aan memorization. During trips with the students the money is sometimes more than is required for the trip. Is it permissible for me to take this money, knowing that I am not paid anything for my work with these circles? Is it permissible for me to take what I need of this money or to take something from the subscriptions paid by the students to join these circles?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.You do not 
    have the right to take anything from this money, because you have been 
    entrusted to spend it for the purpose for which it was given, which is to 
    take the students on trips. So it is not permissible for you to spend it on 
    anything other than the purpose it was paid for. Allaah says (interpretation 
    of the meaning): 
“Verily, 
    Allaah commands that you should render back the trusts to those, to whom 
    they are due”
[al-Nisa’ 
    4:58]
What you 
    must do is to give the money back to those who paid it, or keep it for them 
    so that you can spend it on the purpose for which it was paid. The fact that 
    you do not receive any salary or remuneration does not allow you to betray 
    the trust and consume wealth unlawfully. You should ask for your right to be 
    given something in return for your work. 
You do not 
    have the right to take anything from the fees paid for the study-circles 
    either, for the reasons stated above. 
What you 
    have to do is to fear Allaah and beware of all haraam wealth. I ask Allaah to help you and guide you and to grant you plentiful provision. 
And Allaah knows best.",Islam Q&A
40472,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/40472,Ruling on fixing TVs and VCRs,"I fix TVs and VCRs, and also install satellite dishes. Is there any sin on me if the owner of these machines uses them to listen to songs and watch movies etc? Please advise me, may Allaah reward you with good.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Help you one another in 
    Al‑Birr and At‑Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one 
    another in sin and transgression”

    [al-Maa’idah 5:2]

    What you are doing by fixing TVs, VCRs and satellite dishes 
    which are then used by their owners to listen to and watch haraam things is 
    a kind of helping in sin. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “Whoever calls people to right guidance will have a reward 
    like that of those who follow him, without it detracting from his reward in 
    the slightest. And whoever calls people to misguidance will have a burden of 
    sin like that of those who followed him without that detracting from their 
    sin in the slightest.” Narrated by Muslim, 2674. 

    So it is not permissible for you to do this work and it is 
    better for you to look for other work. Remember that Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He 
    will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty).

    3. And He will provide him from (sources) he never could 
    imagine”

    [al-Talaaq 65:2-3]

    The Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas was asked: I work 
    as an electronic engineer and my work involves fixing radios, TVs and VCRs, 
    and similar equipment. I hope that you can advise me as to whether I should 
    continue in this work, knowing that if I leave this job I will miss out on  
    a lot of experience in my field that I have been learning all my life, and I 
    may be adversely affected by leaving it. 

    They replied:  
The evidence of 
    sharee’ah from the Qur’aan and Sunnah indicates that the Muslim must be keen 
    to seek a good income, so you should look for a job from which your income 
    will be good (i.e., halaal). 

    With regard to your income from the job you mention, it is 
    not good (halaal), because these machines are usually used for haraam 
    things.
