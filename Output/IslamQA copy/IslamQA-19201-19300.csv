19229,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/19229,Is it permissible to buy phone cards with pictures of women on them?,"There is a brother who has a phone store, and he has some doubts about the money he earns through this store. He sells phone cards for cell phones or land lines on which there are pictures of women in make up or young men. Is the money that he gets from that halaal? Please note that there are other kinds of cards which do not have any pictures of people on them, so should he avoid the first kind?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not 
    permissible for the companies that produce phone cards to put pictures of 
    women on them, and it is not permissible for printers to print these cards, 
    because these pictures degrade women and make them like products to be 
    marketed, and because they are a source of temptation for young men who may 
    be provoked and tempted into doing evil deeds. 
With regard 
    to the one who buys these cards to sell them, if the image is what the 
    purchaser wants and he will keep it, then it is not permissible to buy them 
    or sell them. If the image is not what is wanted and the card will 
    eventually be thrown into the trash, then it is permissible to buy them and 
    sell them. 
Most of 
    these cards are bought to be used for phone calls, not because there are 
    pictures on them. 
If he can 
    erase the picture or remove it without affecting the sale, then he should do 
    that. If he can find other cards which have no pictures, then he should not 
    ignore them and buy the first kind, rather he and others should refrain from 
    buying them; perhaps not buying them will put pressure on them and they will 
    stop putting pictures of women on these cards.
