Or are we all waiting for the 'Day of Judgment' before entering heaven or hell I have heard some references to people who have seen heaven or are in heaven now or went to heaven and saw how it was Again, I am not including prophets and angels to this list of people",,,"Praise be to Allah.Allah has created Paradise and its creation is complete, because He says in a hadith qudsi: ""I have prepared for My righteous slaves that which no eye has seen…"" And because the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw it on the night of the Israa' and Mi'raaj, and because of other proofs (daleel).
Will any humans enter it before the Day of Resurrection?
There are two aspects to this:
1. Entering it in spirit only, as is the case with the dead. This is proven in the case of the Prophets, and of the martyrs (shuhadaa') whose souls are in the crops of green birds which roam about in Paradise. This is also known from the ahadith in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) describes how he entered Paradise in dreams, which has to do with the soul or spirit.
2. With regard to entering Paradise in both body and soul, this will happen on the Day of Resurrection for both humans and jinn. The only exception to this is Adam (peace be upon him) who was in Paradise before he came down to this earth, as was mentioned by Ibn al-Qayyim and others.

4010,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4010,Ruling on learning magic and removing spells from a person affected by magic,Is it permissible to learn how to remove spells from a person affected by magic?,,,"Praise be to Allah.If 
          that is by doing something permissible, such as reciting du’aa’s that 
          are prescribed or permitted in Islam, or by using a ruqyah that is prescribed 
          in Islam, there is nothing wrong with that. But if a person learns magic 
          in order to counteract magic, or for any other purposes, then that is 
          not permitted and in fact is something which nullifies a person’s Islam,

          sacrifices to them and seeking to draw close to them with things that 
          they love, until they serve a person and do what he wants. This is the 
          mutual benefit which Allaah refers to in the aayah (interpretation of

Gambling turns people away from the remembrance of Allah.,"Is gambling haram?


Why is gambling haram?


What are the negative consequences of gambling?","Praise be to Allah.Is gambling haram?
Gambling is haram because Allah has forbidden it, and He rules as He wills. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“O you who believe! Intoxicants (all kinds of alcoholic drinks), gambling, al-Ansab [sacrifices for idols, etc.] and al-Azlam [arrows for seeking luck or decision] are an abomination of Shaytan’s handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) in order that you may be successful. Shaytan wants only to excite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants (alcoholic drink) and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of Allah and from al-salah (the prayer). So, will you not then abstain?” [al-Maidah 5:90-91]
Why is gambling haram?
With regard to the wisdom behind the prohibition of gambling , any wise person will see that there are many reasons for it, including the following:

Gambling makes a person rely on accidents, luck and wishful thinking for his earnings, instead of hard work, the sweat of his brow and paying respect to the ways prescribed by Allah.
Gambling destroys families and causes the loss of wealth through haram means. It makes rich families poor and humiliates proud souls.
Gambling results in enmity and hatred among the players, because they are consuming one another’s wealth unlawfully and getting wealth unlawfully.
Gambling turns people away from the remembrance of Allah and from prayer, and pushes the players to have the worst of attitudes and habits.
Gambling is a sinful hobby that wastes time and effort, and makes people get used to laziness and idleness. It stops the ummah from working and producing.
Gambling pushes people to commit crimes because the one who is penniless wants to get hold of money in any way he can, even if he has to steal it or take it by force, or through accepting bribes and cheating.
Gambling causes stress, illness and nervous breakdowns. It breeds hatred and in most cases leads to crime, suicide, insanity and chronic illness.
Gambling pushes the gambler to bad behaviour such as drinking alcohol and taking drugs. The atmosphere in which gambling takes place is dimly lit and filled with cigarette smoke; people talk in hushed voices and whispers, and sneak in and out as if they are up to no good. They come in hesitantly, filled with suspicion, and gather around the green table, breathing uneasily and with their hearts pounding. They are supposed to be friends playing a game, but in reality they are enemies, each of them lying in wait for the other and trying to make gains at the expense of the other and his children. The owner of the place tries to numb the feelings of all participants by offering dreamy music, fallen women, all kinds of drinks and cigarettes. The green table is surrounded with cheating and deception. The waiters and girls may tell one player about another player’s cards, helping one player to beat another by means of nods and whispers. Sometimes they achieve a kind of balance to make sure the game carries on and people stay for longer. No doubt everyone loses in the end, they lose the money they spend on drinks and cigarettes, the money they give to the waiters, the money they spend on drinks for the girls, and all kinds of other losses. Even the one who wins all or most of the games loses all or most of his winnings, and the loser loses everything. And at the end of the night, they all sneak away, showing the signs of depression and humiliation, and the loser warns the winner to look out the next day. (Ahmad Shalabi, al-Hayat al-Ijtima’iyyah fi’l-Tafkir al-Islami, p. 241)

What are the negative consequences of gambling?
How many families have become poor because of gambling ? How many mouths have gone hungry, how many bodies have become naked or been clothed in nothing but rags? How many marriages have failed, how many jobs have been lost, because of a person who stole money to support his gambling habit? How many men have sold their religion and honour at the gambling table? Gambling destroys everything, even when the aim is money. It includes wine, smoking, bad company, darkness, confusion, cheating, hatred, watching for opportunities to take advantage of others, deception and all other kinds of evil. (Qadaya al-Lahw wa’l-Tarfih, p. 388)

4015,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4015,Can You Combine Shawwal Fasting with al-Ayyam al-Beed?,"Will a person be rewarded if he combines three of the six days of Shawwal with the Ayyam al-Beed (Days 13,14,15 from every month)?","If you fast the six days of Shawwal, you do not have to fast al-Ayyam al-Beed during that month too and hopefully you will be rewarded for that.",,"Praise be to Allah.I asked our Shaykh, ‘Abd al-‘Azهz ibn ‘Abd-Allah ibn Baz about this matter, and he replied that hopefully he will be rewarded for that, because it is true that he fasted the six days of Shawwal , and it is also true that he fasted the al-Ayyam al-Beed , and the Bounty of Allah is great indeed.
With regard to this particular matter, Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-‘Uthaymin replied as follows:
“Yes, if he fasts six days of Shawwal , he does not have to fast al-Ayyam al-Beed during that month too, whether he fasted the six days at the same time as al-Ayyam al-Beed (the 13 th, 14th and 15th of the hijri month) or before them or after them, because it is true that he has fasted three days of the month. ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: ‘The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to fast three days of every month, and he did not bother whether he fasted them at the beginning of the month or in the middle or at the end.”
This case is similar to that of Tahiyyat al-Masjid (prayer to “greet the mosque” upon entering), which does not have to be done if one prays a regular prayer upon entering the mosque. So if you enter the mosque and pray a regular Sunnah prayer, you do not have to pray Tahiyyat al-masjid…

4017,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4017,Does a woman have to defend    herself against a would-be rapist?,"Does a woman have to defend herself if someone wants to rape her, and is she allowed to use a weapon for that purpose?",,,"Praise be to Allah.A woman who is being forced to commit zinaa [unlawful sexual activity] is obliged to defend herself and should not give in even if she kills the one who wants to do that to her. This self-defence is waajib (obligatory), and she is not at fault if she kills the one who wants to force her into zinaa. Imaam Ahmad and Ibn Hibbaan reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Whoever is killed defending his property is a shaheed (martyr), whoever is killed defending himself is a shaheed, whoever is killed defending his religion is a shaheed, and whoever is killed defending his family is a shaheed. In the commentary on this hadeeth it says: whoever is killed defending his family is a shaheed refers to the one who defends the honour of his wife and female relatives.
If a man is obliged to defend his wife and fight off the one who wants to rape her even if this leads to his own death then this obligation applies even more to the woman herself, who must defend herself and not give in to the aggressor who wants to violate her honour, even if she is killed, because if she is killed she will also be a shaheedah, just as her husband will be a shaheed if he was killed defending her honour. Shahaadah (martyrdom, the status of shaheed) is a high status which is only achieved by the one who dies in the way of obedience to Allaah and that which He loves, which indicates that Allaah loves this kind of defence, a mans fighting to defend his wifes honour and a womans fighting to defend herself. But if she is unable to defend herself, and the evil aggressor overpowers her and rapes her by force, then she should not be subjected to any punishment (hadd or tazeer); rather, the punishment should be carried out on the evil aggressor.
It says in al-Mughni by Ibn Qudaamah al-Hanbali: Concerning a woman who was pursued by a man, and she killed him to protect herself, Ahmad said: If she knew that he wanted [to rape] her, and she killed him to protect herself, then she is not at fault. Ahmad mentioned the hadeeth which al-Zuhri reported from al-Qaasim ibn Muhammad, from Ubayd ibn Umayr, in which it said that a man had visitors from [the tribe of] Hudhayl, and he wanted [to rape] a woman, so she threw a rock at him and killed him. Umar said, By Allaah, there is no diyah for him ever i.e., she did not have to pay the blood money for him. If it is permissible to defend one's money, which one can give away, then a woman defending and protecting herself and her honour which cannot be given away, is clearly more permissible than a man defending his money. If this is clear, then she is obliged to defend herself if she can, because letting someone overpower her [rape her] is haraam, and by not defending herself, she lets him overpower her. [al-Mughni, 8/331]
And Allaah knows best. Al-Mufassal fi Ahkaam al-Marah, 5/42-43.
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Turuq al-Hukmiyyah, 18: (Section) A woman who had committed zinaa was brought to Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with him), and he asked her about it and she admitted it, so he commanded that she should be stoned. Ali said: Maybe she had a reason. So he said to her, What made you do that? She said, I had a partner who shared livestock with me; his camels had water and milk, and mine had none. I got thirsty, so I asked him to give me something to drink, but he refused unless I let him have his way with me. I refused three times, but I was so thirsty that I thought I was going to die, so I gave him what he wanted, and he gave me something to drink. Ali said: Allaahu akbar! But if one is forced by necessity without wilful disobedience nor transgressing due limits, then there is no sin on him. Truly Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. [al-Baqarah 2:173 interpretation of the meaning].
In Sunan al-Bayhaqi it says: From Abu Abd al-Rahmaan al-Sulami, who said: A woman was brought to Umar who had been extremely thirsty, and had passed by a shepherd and asked him to give her something to drink; he had refused to give her something to drink unless she let him have his way with her. [Umar] consulted with the people as to whether he should have her stoned. Ali said, She was forced to do it. I think you should let her go. So he did so. I say: this is what should be done. If a woman is in desperate need of food and drink from a man, which he will not give her unless she lets him have his way with her, and she is scared that she will die without them, so she lets him have his way with her, then she is not to be punished. If it were asked, is it permissible for her in this situation to let him have his way with her, or does she have to suffer [her hunger and thirst] with patience, even if she dies? The answer is that her case is like that of a woman who is forced to commit zinaa, to whom it is said, Either you let me have my way with you, or I will kill you. The woman who is forced to do this should not be punished; she can save herself from being killed in this manner, but if she bears it (i.e., being killed) with sabr (patience), this is better for her.

4019,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4019,Argument over whether to keep the partition between men and women in the mosque,"In one of the mosques there is a partition between men and women. A dispute has arisen as to how important this partition is. Some think that there is no need for it, because at the time of the Messenger 
(peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) there was no partition; others insist on having it. The resulting argument may lead those who think there should be no partition to stop praying in the mosque, despite the fact that removing the partition could lead to some degree of mixing or looking at the opposite sex when leaving the mosque, because some of the men are not strongly committed in their religion. Should we insist on keeping the partition even though some people may stop praying in the mosque, or should we remove it
although this may lead to people looking at the opposite sex?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen answered this question as
    follows:
The partition should stay. The fact that there was no partition at the
    time of the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was either because
    there was no need for it or because there was a reason why they could not have a
    partition. With regard to the former, the Sahaabah, may Allaah be pleased with them, had
    such strong faith in Allaah that they would not look at women; with regard to the latter,
    the financial situation of the Sahaabah, as we know, especially before the conquests, was
    one of hardship, and they could not afford to put a partition between themselves and the
    women. Having understood this, we should next look at which is further removed from
    fitnah, having a partition or not having it? Everyone will agree that having the partition
    is less likely to cause fitnah. If that is the case, then whatever is less likely to cause
    fitnah is what should be done. If you say, “If we insist on keeping it, those who
    want to remove it will stay away from the mosque,” our response is that if they stay
    away, they are doing wrong. They have no excuse for failing to pray in jamaa’ah
    because of this partition being there. Having the partition there is not a sin such that
    they could say, “We are not coming to be witnesses to sin.” If they stay away,
    they are committing sin by failing to attend prayers in congregation.",Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen

What is the ruling on this?",,,"Praise be to Allah.We put this question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen,
    may Allaah preserve him, who replied:
“I think that this is an innovated bid’ah. No preacher can
    claim that he loves to preach to people more than the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) did. It is not reported anywhere that the Messenger of
    Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to stand up to address the people
    with a khutbah in the graveyard. All that is mentioned is that one day he came to a grave
    when the burial had not yet been completed. He sat down, and his companions sat down with
    him, and he started talking to them about what happens when a person is on his deathbed
    and after he dies. This is the nearest thing that has been reported, and anyone who stands
    up to preach to the people after a burial is doing so on the basis of incorrect ijtihaad.
Question:
But the fact that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
    him) did this once…?
Answer:
He did not preach as such. He just started talking to the people who
    were sitting with him. It was not intended as preaching and he did not stand up to deliver
    a khutbah.
Question:
So if a person sits by the grave and others sit with him, and he tells
    them the hadeeth of Abu Dawood (the hadeeth of al-Bara’), would this action be OK
    according to sharee’ah?
Answer:
It is not OK according to sharee’ah, because the Messenger of
    Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not sit with the intention of
    preaching. He just sat down to wait until the burial was over. There is a difference

Is it permissible for her to wash his body?",,,"Praise be to Allah.We put this question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, may Allah preserve him, who answered:
“No, because when she gave birth, the relationship between her and her husband came to an end. It is not permissible for her to wash him because now she is no longer his wife, and thus if she were to enter into a (new) marriage contact at this time, it would be valid.”
When a woman’s husband dies, she should observe the ‘iddah (waiting period or mourning period) of four months and ten days. If she is pregnant, her ‘iddah lasts until she gives birth. Once her ‘iddah is over or she has given birth, there is no longer any connection between them. It is permissible for a wife to wash her husband’s body, and vice versa, if this is still within the ‘iddah period, because the connection between husband and wife does not end merely because of death. The evidence for this from the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came back from (the cemetery of) al-Baqee’ and found me suffering a headache, saying ‘Oh, my head!’ He said, ‘No, O ‘Aa’ishah, it is I who should be saying, “Oh, my head!”’ Then he said, ‘What’s the matter? If you die before me, I will take care of you: I will wash your body, wrap you in your shroud, pray for you and bury you.’”
(Reported by Ibn Maajah, 1454; classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Ahkam al-Janaa’iz, page 50). It was reported that ‘Aa’ishah said, concerning the death of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “If I could go back and do things all over again, no one would wash him but his wives.” (Reported by Abu Dawood, 3733.

It is not essential for a person swearing an oath to put his hand on the
        Mus-haf (copy of the Qur’an) for the oath to be valid, but some people do this to
        make the oath more binding, so that the person swearing the oath will be afraid to tell
        lies.
It is not permissible for the Muslim to put his hand on the Tawraat or
        Injeel when swearing an oath, because the copies in circulation are distorted, and are not
        the original Books that were revealed to Moosa and ‘Eesaa (peace be upon them); and

He replied, may Allah preserve him,
“I do not think that this is right.
Firstly, because other people besides him may also look at it.
Secondly, because a picture does not reflect reality completely. How often have people seen pictures then when they see the person or scene in real life they find that it is completely different.
Thirdly, the fiancé may keep this picture, then change his mind about marrying her, but he still has the picture and can play about with it as he wishes.

O disbeliever, we debate with you in the words addressed by Allaah (the
    Arabic name of the One True God) to the People of the Book (Jews and Christians) and the
    disbelievers. He says (interpretation of the meaning):
“O People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Do not exceed
    the limits in your religion, nor say of Allaah aught but the truth. The Messiah ‘Eesa
    (Jesus) son of Maryam (Mary) was (no more than) a Messenger of Allaah and His Word
    (‘Be!’ – and he was), which He bestowed on Maryam, and a spirit created by
    Him; so believe in Allaah and His Messengers. Say not: ‘Three (trinity)!’ Cease!
    (it is) better for you. For Allaah is (the only) One (God). Glory be to Him (Far Exalted
    is He) above having a son. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in
    the earth. And Allaah is All-Sufficient as a Disposer of Affairs.”
[al-Nisa’ 4:171]
“Say: O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Do you
    criticize us for no other reason than that we believe in Allaah, and in (the revelation)
    which has been sent down before (us), and that most of you are faasiqoon (rebellious and
    disobedient [to Allaah])?”
[al-Maa’idah 5:59]
“How can you disbelieve in Allaah? Seeing that you were dead and
    He gave you life. Then He will give you death, then again will bring you to life (on the
    Day of Resurrection) and then unto Him you will return.”
[al-Baqarah 2:28]
“… whosoever disbelieves in Allaah, His Angels, His Books,
    His Messengers, and the Last Day, then indeed he has strayed far away…
Verily, those who disbelieve in Allaah and His messengers and wish to
    make a distinction between Allaah and His Messengers (by believing in Allaah and
    disbelieving in His Messengers) saying, ‘We believe in some but not in others,’
    and wish to adopt a way in between,
They are in truth disbelievers. And We have prepared for the
    disbelievers a humiliating torment.”
[al-Nisa’ 4:136, 150-151]
O disbeliever, do you think that you can do any harm to Allaah by
    your disbelief? Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):

    those who disbelief (at death), they smite their faces and their backs, (saying):

    Day (i.e., the Day of Resurrection, when they will be thrown in the blazing Fire).”

“… But those who disbelieved will have a drink of boiling
    fluids and painful torment because they used to disbelieve.”
[Yoonus 10:5]
Do you know what you will have to wear on that Day? Allaah says
    (interpretation of the meaning):
“… Then as for those who disbelieve, garments of fire will
    be cut out for them, boiling water will be poured down over their heads.”

Do you know what kind of punishment you will endure? 
“Surely! Those who disbelieved in Our Signs, We shall burn them

    torment be lightened for them. Thus do We requite every disbeliever!”
[Faatir 35:36]
O disbeliever, have the glad tidings of a punishment from which you
    will not be able to ransom yourself:
“Verily, those who disbelieve, if they had all that is in the

    Day of Resurrection, it would never be accepted of them, and theirs would be a painful
    torment.”

O disbeliever, if you want to mock Islam and its followers, this is

“Beautified is the life of this world for those who disbelieve,
    and they mock at those who believe. But those who obey Allaah’s Orders and keep away
    from what He has forbidden, will be above them on the Day of Resurrection. And Allaah
    gives (of His bounty on the Day of Resurrection) to whom He wills without limit.”
[al-Baqarah 2:212]
O disbeliever, if you think that the light of Islam will be

    with their mouths, but Allaah will not allow except that His Light should be perfected

    Allaah, so save yourself from this curse:
“Verily, Allaah has cursed the disbelievers, and has prepared
    for them a flaming Fire (Hell).”
[al-Ahzaab 33:64]
There is still time for you to repent from sin and transgression, so
    long as you are still alive. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Say to those who have disbelieved, if they cease (from
    disbelief) their past will be forgiven. But if they return (thereto), then the examples of
    those (punished) before them have already preceded (as a warning).”

‘Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds. Nothing to that effect has been reported in any saheeh hadeeth from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or from his Companions. None of the imams of the Muslims encouraged or recommended such things, neither the four imams, nor any others. No reliable scholars have narrated anything like this, neither from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), nor from the Sahabah, nor from the Tabi'een; neither in any saheeh report or in a da’eef (weak) report; neither in the books of Saheeh, nor in al-Sunan, nor in the Musnads. No hadeeth of this nature was known during the best centuries, but some of the later narrators reported ahadeeth like the one which says “Whoever puts kohl in his eyes on the day of Ashura will not suffer from eye disease in that year, and whoever takes a bath (does ghusl) on the day of Ashura will not get sick in that year, etc.” They also narrated reports concerning the supposed virtues of praying on the day of Ashura, and other reports saying that on the day of Ashura Adam repented, the Ark settled on Mount Joodi, Yoosuf returned to Ya’qoob, Ibraheem was saved from the fire, the ram was provided for sacrifice instead of Ismaa’eel, and so on. They also reported a fabricated hadeeth that is falsely attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), which says, “Whoever is generous to his family on the day of Ashura, Allah will be generous to him for the rest of the year.”
(Then Ibn Taymiyah discussed the two misguided groups who were in Koofah, Iraq, both of whom took Ashura as a festival because of their bid’ah). The Rafidi group made an outward show of allegiance to the Ahl al-Bayt although inwardly they were either heretics and disbelievers or ignorant and bound by whims and desires. The Nasibi group hated ‘Ali and his companions, because of the troubles and killings that had occurred. It is reported in Saheeh Muslim that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “In (the tribe of) Thaqeef there will be a liar and an oppressor.” The liar was al-Mukhtar ibn Abi ‘Ubayd al-Thaqafi, who made an outward show of allegiance to and support of the Ahl al-Bayt, and killed ‘Ubayd-Allah ibn Ziyad, the governor of Iraq, who had equipped the party that killed al-Husayn ibn ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with them both); then he (al-Mukhaar) made it clear that he was a liar, by claiming to be a prophet and that Jibreel (peace be upon him) brought revelation to him. People told Ibn ‘Umar and Ibn ‘Abbas about this, and said to one of them, “al-Mukhtar ibn Abi ‘Ubayd is claiming to receive revelation [annahu yanzilu ‘alayhi].” He said, “He is telling the truth, for Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘Shall I inform you (O people) upon whom the shayateen (devils) descend [tanazzalu]? They descend upon every lying, sinful person.’ [al-Shu’ara’ 26:221].” [Translator’s note: the words translated as “receive revelation” and “descend” both come from the same root in Arabic]. They said to the other: “Al-Mukhtar is claiming that he receives inspiration.” He said, “he is telling the truth. ‘… And certainly, the Shayateen (devils) do inspire their friends (from mankind) to dispute with you…’ [al-An’aam 6:121 – interpretation of the meaning].” As for the oppressor , this was al-Hajjaj ibn Yoosuf al-Thaqafi, who was opposed to ‘Ali and his companions. Al-Hajjaj was a Nasibi and al-Mukhtar was a Rafidi, and this Rafidi was a greater liar and more guilty of fabrication and heresy, because he claimed to be a prophet…
There was much trouble and fighting between these two groups in Kufa. When al-Husayn ibn ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with them both) was killed on the day of Ashura, he was killed by the sinful, wrongdoing group. Allah honoured al-Husayn with martyrdom, as He honoured other members of his family, and raised his status, as He honoured Hamzah, Ja’far, his father ‘Ali and others. Al-Husayn and his brother al-Hasan are the leaders of the youth of Paradise. High status can only be attained through suffering, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him said, when he was asked which people suffer the most. He said, “The Prophets, then righteous people, then the next best and the next best. A man will suffer according to his level of faith. If his faith is solid, he will suffer more, but if his faith is shaky, he will suffer less. The believer will keep on suffering until he walks on the earth with no sin.” (reported by al-Tirmidhi and others). Al-Hasan and al-Husayn achieved what they achieved and reached the high status they reached by the help and decree of Allah. They did not suffer as much as their forefathers had, for they were born and raised during the glory days of Islam, and the Muslims respected and honoured them. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) died when they were still young, and Allah blessed them by testing them in such a manner that they would be able to catch up with the rest of their family members, as those who were of a higher status than them were also tested. ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib was better than them, and he was killed as a shaheed (martyr). The killing of al-Husayn was one of the things that caused fitnah (tribulation) among the people, as was the killing of ‘Uthman, which was one of the greatest causes of fitnah, because of which the ummah is still split today. Thus the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There are three things, whoever is saved from them is truly saved: my death, the killing of a patient khaleefah, and the Dajjal (‘antichrist’).”
Then Shaykh al-Islam (may Allah have mercy on him) mentioned a little about the biography of al-Hasan and his just character, then he said:
“Then he died, and Allah was pleased with him and honoured him. Some groups wrote to al-Husayn and promised to support and help him if he went ahead and declared himself khaleefah, but they were not sincere. When al-Husayn sent his cousin [son of his paternal uncle] to them, they broke their word and gave help to the one they had promised to defend him against, and fought with him against [al-Husayn’s cousin]. Those who were wise and who loved al-Husayn, such as Ibn 'Abbas and Ibn ‘Umar and others, advised him not to go to them, and not to accept any promises from them. They thought that his going to them served no useful interest and that the consequences would not be good. Things turned out just as they said, and this is how Allah decreed it would happen. When al-Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him) went out and saw that things were not as he had expected, he asked them to let him go back, or to let him join the army that was defending the borders of Islam, or join his cousin Yazeed, but they would not let him do any of these things unless he gave himself up to them as a prisoner. So he fought with them, and they killed him and some of those who were with him, and he was wrongfully slain so he died as a shaheed whose martyrdom brought him honour from Allah, and so he was reunited with the good and pure members of his family. His murder brought shame on those who had wrongfully killed him, and caused much mischief among the people. An ignorant, wrongful group – who were either heretics and hypocrites, or misguided and misled – made a show of allegiance to him and the members of his household, so they took the day of ‘Ashura as a day of mourning and wailing, in which they openly displayed the rituals of jahiliyyah such as slapping their cheeks and rending their garments, grieving in the manner of the jahiliyyah. But what Allah has commanded us to do when disaster strikes – when the disaster is fresh – is to bear it with patience and fortitude, and to seek reward, and to remember that all things come from Allah and we must return to Him, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): “… but give glad tidings to al-sabiroon (the patient ones), who, when afflicted with calamity, say: ‘Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return.’ They are those on whom are al-salawat (the blessings) (i.e., who are blessed and will be forgiven) from their Lord, and (they are those who) receive His Mercy, and it is they who are the guided ones.” [al-Baqarah 2:155-157] .
It is reported in al-Saheeh that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “he is not one of us who strikes his cheeks, rends his garments and prays with the prayer of Jahiliyyah.” And he said: “I have nothing to do with those who strike [their cheeks], shave [their heads] and rend [their garments].” And he said: “If the woman who wails does not repent before she dies, she will be raised up on the Day of Resurrection wearing trousers made of tar and a shirt of scabs.” In al-Musnad, it is reported from Faatimah bint al-Husayn, from her father al-Husayn, that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no man who suffers a calamity, and when he remembers it, even if it is old, he says ‘Innaa Lillaahi wa innaa ilayhi raaji’oon (Truly, to Allaah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return),’ but Allaah will give a reward equal to the reward He gave him on the day he suffered the calamity.” This is how Allaah honours the Believers. If the disaster suffered by al-Husayn, and other disasters, are mentioned after all this time, we should say “Innaa Lillaahi wa innaa ilayhi raaji’oon (Truly, to Allaah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return),” as Allaah and His Messenger commanded, so as to be given the reward like that earned on the day of the disaster itself. If Allaah commanded us to be patient and steadfast and to seek reward at the time of the disaster, then how about after the passing of time? The Shaytaan made this attractive to those who are misled, so they took the day of ‘Aashooraa’ as an occasion of mourning, when they grieve and wail, recite poems of grief and tell stories filled with lies. Whatever truth there may be in these stories serves no purpose other than the renewal of their grief and sectarian feeling, and the stirring up of hatred and hostility among the Muslims, which they do by cursing those who came before them, and telling many lies, and causing much trouble in the world. The various sects of Islam have never known any group tell more lies or cause more trouble or help the kuffaar against the Muslims more than this misguided and evil group. They are even worse than the Khawaarij who went beyond the pale of Islam. They are the ones of whom the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “They will kill the people of Islam and will leave alone the people who worship idols.” This group cooperated with the Jews, Christians and mushrikeen against the members of the Prophet’s household and his believing ummah, and also helped the mushrik Turks and Tatars to do what they did in Baghdaad and elsewhere to the descendents of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), i.e., the ‘Abbaasid rulers and others, and the believers; the Turks and Tatars killed them, enslaved their women and destroyed their homes. The evil and harm that they do to the Muslims cannot be enumerated by any man, no matter how eloquent he is. Some others – either Naasibis who oppose and have enmity towards al-Husayn and his family or ignorant people who try to fight evil with evil, corruption with corruption, lies with lies and bid’ah with bid’ah – opposed them by fabricating reports in favour of making the day of ‘Aashooraa’ a day of celebration, by wearing kohl and henna, spending money on one's children, cooking special dishes and other things that are done on Eids and special occasions. These people took the day of ‘Aashooraa’ as a festival like Eid, whereas the others took it as a day of mourning. Both are wrong, and both go against the Sunnah, even though the other group (the Rafidis) are worse in intention and more ignorant and more plainly wrong… But Allaah commands us to be just and to treat others well. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Those of you who live after my death will see many disputes. I urge you to adhere to my Sunnah and the sunnah of my rightly-guided successors (al-khulafa’ al-raashidoon) who come after me. Hold onto it as if biting it with your eyeteeth. Beware of newly-innovated matters, for every innovation is a going astray.” Neither the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) nor his rightly-guided successors (the khulafa’ al-raashidoon) did any of these things on the day of ‘Aashooraa’, they neither made it a day of mourning nor a day of celebration.
But “when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came to Madeenah, he saw the Jews fasting on the day of ‘Aashooraa’. He said, ‘What is this?’ They said, ‘This is the day when Allaah saved Moosa from drowning, so we fast on this day.’ He said, ‘We have more right to Moosa than you,’ so he fasted on that day and commanded [the Muslims] to fast on that day.”
Quraysh also used to venerate this day during the Jaahiliyyah. The day on which people were ordered to fast was just one day. When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came to Madeenah it was Rabee’ al-Awwal, and the following year he fasted ‘Aashooraa’ and commanded the people to fast. Then in that year fasting in Ramadaan was made obligatory and fasting on ‘Aashooraa’ was abrogated. The scholars disputed as to whether fasting on that day (‘Aashooraa’) was waajib (obligatory) or mustahabb (encouraged). Of the two best known opinions, the more correct view is that it was waajib, then after that whoever fasted it did it because it was mustahabb. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not tell ordinary Muslims to fast on ‘Aashooraa’, but he used to say, “This is the day of ‘Aashooraa’; I am fasting on this day and whoever wishes to fast on this day may fast.” And he said: “Fasting on ‘Aashooraa’ expiates for the sins of one year and fasting on the day of ‘Arafaah expiates for the sins of two years.” When, towards the end of his life, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) heard that the Jews took the day of ‘Aashooraa’ as a festival, he said, “If I live until next year, I will certainly fast on the ninth” – to be different from the Jews, and not to resemble them in taking the day as a festival.
There were some of the Sahaabah and scholars who did not fast on this day and did not regard it as mustahabb, but thought it makrooh to single out this day for fasting. This was reported from a group of the Koofiyeen (scholars of Kufa). Some other scholars said that it was mustahabb to fast on this day. The correct view is that it is mustahabb for the one who fasts on ‘Aashooraa’ to fast on the ninth day [of Muharram] too, because this was the ultimate command of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), as he said: “If I live until next year, I will certainly fast on the ninth as well as the tenth.” This was reported with a variety of isnaads. This is what is prescribed in the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).
As for the other things, such as cooking special dishes with or without grains, or wearing new clothes, or spending money on one’s family, or buying the year’s supplies on that day, or doing special acts of worship such as special prayers or deliberately slaughtering an animal on that day, or saving some of the meat of the sacrifice to cook with grains, or wearing kohl and henna, or taking a bath (ghusl), or shaking hands with one another, or visiting one another, or visiting the mosques and mashhads (shrines) and so on… all of this is reprehensible bid’ah and is wrong. None of it has anything to do with the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or the way of the Khulafa’ al-Raashidoon. It was not approved of by any of the imaams of the Muslims, not Maalik, not al-Thawri, not al-Layth ibn Sa’d, not Abu Haneefah, not al-Oozaa’i, not al-Shaafa'i, not Ahmad ibn Hanbal, not Ishaaq ibn Raahwayh, not any of the imaams and scholars of the Muslims.
The religion of Islam is based on two principles: that we should worship nothing besides Allaah Alone, and that we should worship Him in the manner that He has prescribed, not by means of bid’ah or reprehensible innovations. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… So whoever hopes for the Meeting with his Lord, let him work righteousness and associate none as a partner in the worship of his Lord.” [al-Kahf 18:110].
Righteous deeds are those which are loved by Allaah and His Messenger, those which are prescribed in Islam and in the Sunnah. Thus ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with him) used to say in his du’aa’: “O Allaah, make all of my deeds righteous and make them purely for Your sake, and do not let there be any share for anyone or anything else in them.”

It is difficult for the woman to sacrifice her marriage, especially when the couple has children and the husband treats her well and she feels a great deal of love for him. We know that if a kaafir woman becomes Muslim it is not permissible for her to remain in a marriage with a kaafir man, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… they are not lawful (wives) for the disbelievers nor are the disbelievers lawful (husbands) for them…” [al-Mumtahinah 60:10].

 He answered:
“She has to leave him, but is it possible for her to

          become Muslim, the marriage will become null and void unless you become

          part of the answer from her, so that we could tell her, “Become Muslim 
          first, then we will tell you about the ruling on staying with your husband”?
Answer:
“No, if we say this, and then we tell her about the ruling 
          and she leaves Islam (becomes an apostate), this will make the problem 
          worse. For this reason the Prophet

When we are talking to women who will be faced 
          with this issue, we should focus on the following points:
Giving 
          priority to love for Allaah and His Messenger over love for anyone else.
If she is sincere in calling him to Islam 
          and in praying for him, Allaah may guide him at her hands.
-Whoever gives up something for the sake of Allaah, Allaah will 
          compensate him or her with something better.
Allaah will never forsake His slave who 
          gives up something he or she loves for His sake.
When a woman like this becomes Muslim and leaves her 
          husband, one of the Muslim brothers should come forward to marry her 
          and take her children into his family, or good-hearted Muslims should 
          undertake the responsibility of spending in charity on her and her children.

4037,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4037,Ruling on    women spending of their own wealth without their husbands’ permission,"I am a working woman, and I have a salary from which I spend on myself and my home, I give some to my family and I give some in charity, and so on. Many of the arguments that I have with my husband arise because of the way I spend my money. Does my husband have the right to object to the way I spend my money? Do I have to ask for his permission when I want to spend any of my money?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Undoubtedly the free adult person who is of sound mind and discernment is permitted to dispose of his own wealth with no restrictions as long as he is alive, whether he is buying, renting, giving a gift, establishing a waqf (endowment) or any other kind of transaction. There is no dispute among the scholars on this point.
There is also no dispute among the scholars concerning the fact that the husband does not have the right to object to the way his wife handles her wealth in transactions such as buying, renting, etc., if the woman is of sound mind and there is no reason why she should not handle her own money and she is not one of those who may be tricked.
(Muraatib al-Ijmaa li Ibn Hazm, 162; al-Ijmaa fil-Fiqh al-Islami, Abu Habeeb, 2/566).
But the scholars differed as to whether a woman has the right to give all or some of her wealth in charity or as a gift without the permission of her husband. The details of their opinions are as follows:
The first opinion:
The husband has the right to prevent her from giving if the amount is more than one third of her wealth, but he does not have this right with regard to lesser amounts. This is the opinion of the Malikis and Hanbalis, and one of the two views narrated from Ahmad.
(Sharh al-Khurashi, 7/103; al-Mughni, 4/513; Nayl al-Awtaar, 6/22). The evidence for this is reports and qiyaas (analogy).
Among the reports referred to are the following:


The report that Khayrah, the wife of Kab ibn Maalik, came to the Prophet with some jewellery of hers. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: It is not permissible for a woman [to dispose of] her wealth without the permission of her husband. Have you asked Kabs permission? She said, Yes. So the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sent for Kab ibn Maalik, her husband, and asked him, Have you given permission to Khayrah to give her jewellery in charity? He said, Yes, so the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) accepted it from her.


(Reported by Ibn Maajah, 2380; its isnaad includes Abd-Allaah ibn Yahya and his father, who are majhool (not known, i.e., not enough information is known about them to ascertain whether they are trustworthy)).
The report narrated from Umar ibn Shuayb from his father from his grandfather that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said in a khutbah (sermon) he gave: It is not permissible for a woman to give anything except with the permission of her husband.
(Sunan Abi Dawood, Buyoo, Baab 84; Sunan al-Nisaai, Zakaah, Baab 58; Musnad Ahmad, 2/179; Sunan Ibn Maajah, 2/798). According to another version: A woman has no right to her money if she is married. (Reported by five, except al-Tirmidhi).
These reports are taken as evidence that a woman does not have the right to spend her money except with her husbands permission, which means that the husbands permission is a condition any time she wants to spend; his right to stop her spending is limited to amounts over one-third of her wealth, because there are reports that indicate that the owner has the right to dispose of one-third or less of his wealth in his will, but he does not have the right to dispose of more than that without the permission of his heirs. This is seen in the famous story of Sad ibn Abi Waqqaas, who asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) if he could give all of his wealth in charity, and he said, No. Sad asked, What about two-thirds? The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, No. Sad said, What about half? The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, No. Sad said, What about a third? The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, [Yes,] a third, but a third is still a lot.
(Agreed upon)
With regard to their using qiyaas (analogy) as evidence, they say that the husbands rights are connected to the wifes wealth, on the basis of the hadeeth: A woman may be married for her wealth, her beauty or her religious commitment.
(Reported by the seven scholars).
Usually a husband increases his mahr because of the wifes wealth, and he will be able to spend her money, and if he cannot afford to spend on her, she will not complain (because she has her own money). This is similar to the rights of heirs in relation to a sick person's wealth.
(al-Mughni, 4/514).
The second opinion:
The husband has the right to stop his wife from spending in all cases, whether it is a small amount or a large amount, except in the case of insignificant things. This is the opinion of al-Layth ibn Sad.
(Nayl al-Awtaar, 6/22).
The third opinion:
The woman is not allowed to spend anything of her wealth at all, except with the permission of her husband. This is the opinion of Taawoos (Fath al-Baari, 5/218). Ibn Hajar said in al-Fath, and Taawoos used as evidence, the hadeeth of Umar ibn Shuayb, It is not permissible for a woman to give anything of her own wealth except with the permission of her husband. This was reported by Abu Dawood and al-Nisaai. Ibn Battaal said: The hadeeth narrated in this chapter are more sound.
The fourth opinion:
The woman has the right to spend her own money in all circumstances, whether in a transaction or otherwise, whether this involves all of her wealth or part of it. This is the opinion of the majority, and is the opinion of the Hanafis, Shaafais and Hanbalis, and of Ibn al-Mundhir.
(al-Mughni, 4/513; al-Ansaaf, 5/342; Maaani al-Athaar, 4/354; al-Baari, 5/318; al-Awtaar, 6/22).
This is the soundest opinion, and is most in accordance with the Quraan, the Sunnah and common sense.
In the Quraan, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
And give to the women (whom you marry) their Mahr (obligatory bridal money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage) with a good heart, but if they, of their own good pleasure, remit any part of it to you, take it, and enjoy it without fear of any harm (as Allaah has made it lawful).[al-Nisa 4:4]
Allaah allows the husband to take what his wife gives him willingly.
Allaah also says (interpretation of the meaning):
And if you divorce them before you have touched (had a sexual relation with) them, and you have appointed unto them the mahr (bridal money given by the husband to the wife at the time of marriage), then pay half of that (mahr), unless the women agree to forego it[al-Baqarah 2:237]
Here Allaah allows women to give up as much of the mahr as they wish if their husbands divorce them, without them having to ask permission from anybody. This indicates that women have the right to decide what to do with their own money, and that a woman has rights to her wealth just as a man has rights to his wealth.
(Sharh al-Maaani al-Athaar, 4/352).
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
And try orphans (as regards their intelligence) until they reach the age of marriage; if then you find sound judgement in them, release their property to them [al-Nisa 4:6]
This clearly means that when the female orphan becomes wise and discerning, she is allowed to handle her own wealth.
Similarly, when the women gave their jewellery in charity after the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had addressed them during his Eid sermon, this was an indication that they are allowed to dispose of their wealth without asking permission from anybody.
(See Ittihaaf al-Khilaan bi Huqooq al-Zawjayn fil-Islam by Dr. Fayhaan ibn Ateeq al-Mutayri, pp. 92-96).
It says in Nayl al-Awtaar: the majority of scholars agreed that women are allowed [to handle their own wealth] with no restrictions and without having to ask their husbands permission, so long as they are not foolish, but if they are foolish, it is not permitted. It says in al-Fath: The majority have a lot of evidence in the Quraan and Sunnah.
The majority of scholars argued against those who used as evidence the hadeeth It is not permissible for a woman to give anything except with the permission of her husband.
(Reported by Abu Dawood, 3079; Saheeh al-Jaami, 7265; some of its narrators have already been mentioned). The majority of scholars said that this has to do with the good manners and proper etiquette required of the wife because of the rights her husband has over her, and because of his status, experience in life and wisdom. Al-Sindi said in his commentary on al-Nisaai with regard to the hadeeth quoted: According to the majority of scholars, this has to do with good manners and making the husband feel good. It was reported from al-Shaafai that the hadeeth was not proven, so how can we use it as evidence when the Quraan, Sunnah, other reports and common sense indicate the opposite? Maymoonah freed a slave before the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) knew anything about it, and he did not tell her off. This and other reports indicate that if this hadeeth is true, it is to be interpreted as being the matter of good manners, and the wife has the option either to ask her husbands permission or not.
So the Muslim woman is encouraged to seek her husbands permission but it is not obligatory for her to do so and she will be rewarded for doing that. Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was asked, Which woman is the best? He said, The one who makes [her husband] happy when he looks at her, who obeys him when he tells her to do something, and who does not oppose him in a manner he dislikes with regard to herself and her wealth.
(Reported by al-Nisaai, 3179; Saheeh al-Jaami, 3292).

          according to sharee’ah for her to abort the foetus.
Secondly: a mother with AIDS taking care of 
          her healthy child and breastfeeding him:
Because current medical knowledge indicates that there

          the way she deals with him is the ordinary way of mixing with people,

Thirdly: the right of the healthy spouse to

Knowing Allah by His Most Beautiful Names increases ones faith, as Shaykh Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Sadi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Believing in and knowing the Most Beautiful Names of Allah includes the three types of Tawheed: Tawheed al-Ruboobiyyah (Unity of Divine Lordship), Tawheed al-Uloohiyyah (Unity of the Divine Nature) and Tawheed al-Asma wal-Sifaat (Unity of the Divine Names and Attributes). These three types of Tawheed form the essence and joy of faith (the word translated here as joy implies peace and relief from stress), and this knowledge is the basis and purpose of faith. The more a person learns about the Names and Attributes of Allah, the more his faith increases and the stronger his conviction becomes.

(Al-Tawdeeh wal-Bayaan li Shajarat al-Eemaan by al-Sadi, p. 41).
Allah created His creatures to know Him and worship Him. This is what is expected from them and what they are required to do, because as Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The key to the call of the Messengers, the essence of their Message, is knowing Allah through His Names and Attributes and Deeds, because this is the foundation on which the rest of the Message, from beginning to end, is built.
(Al-Sawaaiq al-Mursalah ala al-Jahamiyyah wal-Muattilah by Ibn al-Qayyim, 1/150-151). So when a person occupies himself with learning about Allah, he is doing what he was created for, but if he ignores the matter, he is neglecting what he was created for. The meaning of faith is not merely to utter words without knowing Allah, because true faith in Allah means that the slave knows the Lord in Whom he believes, and he makes the effort to learn about Allah through His Names and Attributes. The more he learns about his Lord, the more he increases in faith.
Knowledge of the Names of Allah is the basis for all other knowledge, as Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Knowledge of the Most Beautiful Names of Allah is the basis of all other kinds of knowledge, for the objects of all these other branches of knowledge were either created or commanded by Him (the various branches of knowledge either deal with objects created by Him or with the laws and guidance revealed by Him). The reason for creation and guidance is found in His Most Beautiful Names (because He is the Creator, He creates things; because He is the Guide to the Straight Path, He reveals guidance, and so on) Knowing the Most Beautiful Names is the basis of all objects of knowledge, because all knowledge stems from these Names

We have an Islamic Da’wah centre but there is no director or anyone we can refer to resolve conflicts. Can a wife’s agreement before a kaafir judge to give up custody of her children be regarded as binding? Can a kaafir judge’s verdict that a father has to spend on his children if they are with the mother be regarded as binding?",,,"Praise be to Allah.We put this question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, may Allaah preserve him, who answered as follows:
Firstly – may Allaah bless you – if the people at the Da’wah centre agree that matters may be referred to them, then this is OK. This is a duty upon them, because we should refer things to Muslims for judgements.
But with regard to the issue of giving up custody – if the mother gives up custody – this does not need the ruling of a judge. If she states that, this is sufficient for it to become binding.
As for spending on the children, so long as they are going to go back to their father when the mother gives up her right to custody, he is going to spend on them anyway.
Question:
If the kaafir judge rules that the father has to spend on them whilst they are with their mother, is this considered to be binding?
Answer:
Even if the judge does not state that the father has to spend on them, it is still his obligation according to sharee’ah.
Question:
But the amount?
Answer:
The amount is to be determined by ‘Urf (local custom).
Question:
So if the amount stipulated by the kaafir judge is in accordance with ‘Urf, is it binding on him?
Answer:
It is binding on him not because it is the ruling of the judge but because it is ‘Urf.
Question:
If the husband and wife agree to refer to a Muslim for judgement, is his ruling binding on them? In the West, the imaam may be a person who is not religious, so can they refer to him for judgement?
Answer:
If there is no one else available, then it is OK, but the fuqaha’ have stated the condition that he should be fit to judge, meaning that he should have knowledge of sharee’ah, but if there is no one else, let them fear Allaah as much as they can.
Question:
There may be no one there at all who knows about passing judgement, but if there is a wise Muslim man?
Answer:
If they ask him to judge between them on the basis that he is going to bring about a reconciliation, this is OK.
Question:
But if we say that it is only for reconciliation, his words will not be binding?
Answer:
No, but if he passes a judgement and they agree to it, then it will become binding. Every reconciliation that the two parties agree to is binding because of the hadeeth: “Reconciliation is permissible among Muslims”. And Allaah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

      in a place where there are a lot of student groups in the university, including groups
      from other religions. We want to distinguish ourselves with something and to have a
      symbol, because symbols are important in distinguishing groups from one another, Can you
      advise us of a specific color or symbol that we can use for this Muslim students’
      group?",,,"Praise be to Allah.We put this question to Shaykh Muhammad Saalih
    ibn ‘Uthaymeen, who replied as follows:
“If the Muslim students agree on something, this is OK, but
    if each Muslim group is adopting its own symbol, it is not right. The symbol or color that
    we recommend is bright green.”
Is there any daleel (evidence) for this color?
“No, but people like this color and in the Qur’aan it
    says (interpretation of the meanings): ‘Their garments will be of fine green
    silk’ [al-Insaan 76:21] and ‘Reclining on green cushions’
    [al-Rahmaan 55:76].”
Is there any indication from the reports that the Prophet SAWS
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had white and black banners that these colors
    are mustahabb in such cases?
“No, we cannot use these colors, because these were the
    banners in that time, and each era has things that are appropriate for it. But black now
    is one of the symbols of the Raafidah, as is well known.”
The crescent is commonly used as a symbol by Muslims to
    distinguish themselves from Christian groups who use the cross as a symbol. Is it
    permissible for us to use the crescent as a symbol in our publications and on our banners,
    to distinguish ourselves from other, non-Muslim groups?
“I do not think this is right, because the crescent was
    originally a symbol that was placed on graves that were worshipped instead of Allah. We
    read this in an answer given by some scholars and leaders of Daw’ah. But we could use
    a picture of the Ka’bah as a symbol, because it is the Qiblah of all Muslims.”
In some countries they put a crescent on Muslim places of
    worship to distinguish them from Christian places of worship, which have crosses on top of
    them. They do this so that people can tell them apart from a distance, because the
    architecture is often similar. Can we say that putting a crescent on the mosques or
    minarets of the Muslims is bid’ah?
“It is as you say (i.e., we can say that). It is sufficient
    for a mosque not to have a Christian symbol on it. Symbols may be something that is
    present, or something that is not present. If the Christians have a symbol, namely the
    cross, then the fact that the Muslims have no symbol is in itself a symbol. (i.e., we do
    not need to put anything).

If it is identified by the owner, then hand it over to him, otherwise the finder can keep it after one year, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) gave instructions to this effect. An exception is made in the case of lost property found in Al-Haramayn (Makkah and Madeenah) – the finder cannot keep it, and it should be announced indefinitely until its owner is found, or the finder can hand it over to the authorities in charge of the Haramayn so that they can keep it for the owner, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said concerning Makkah, “Property lost in Makkah is not permissible for anyone except its owner.” And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I have made Madeenah sacred just as Ibraaheem made Makkah sacred.” The authenticity of the hadith is agreed upon.
But if the property is of insignificant value and the owner will not be bothered about it, such as a rope or shoelace or a small amount of money, then the finder does not have to announce it, and he can make use of it or give it in charity on behalf of the owner. This does not apply in the case of lost camels and other animals that are safe from small predators such as wolves etc.. It is not permissible to keep these animals, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to the one who asked him about that: “Leave it alone, for it has its feet and its water, and it can eat the trees until it finds its owner.” (Agreed upon).

Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was asked the following question: is it
    permissible for me to pick up lost property in Makkah and take it and announce it in the
    area where I live, or do I have to announce it at the doors of the mosque and
    market-places etc. in Makkah itself?
He answered, may Allâh preserve him: the case of lost property in
    Makkah is unique in that it is not permissible for anyone to pick it up except the one who
    wants to announce it indefinitely or hand it over to those who are in charge of such
    things, because the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “It is
    not permissible to pick up lost property except for the one who wants to announce
    it.” The reason behind this is that if the lost property is left where it is, its
    owner will probably come back and find it. On this basis, we say to this brother: you have
    to announce it in Makkah, in and around the place where you found it, such as at the doors
    of the mosque and in places where people gather, otherwise you should hand it in to those
    whose job it is to take care of lost property etc. Fatawa Islamiyah, 2/311.

Qadianiyyah is a movement that started in 1900 CE as a plot by the British colonialists in the Indian subcontinent, with the aim of diverting Muslims away from their religion and from the obligation of jihaad in particular, so that they would not oppose colonialism in the name of Islam. The mouthpiece of this movement is the magazine Majallat Al-Adyaan (Magazine if Religions) which was published in English.
Foundation and prominent personalities:


Mirza Ghulam Ahmad al-Qadiani (1839-1908 CE) was the main tool by means of which Qadianiyyah was founded. He was born in the village of Qadian, in the Punjab, in India, in 1839 CE. He came from a family that was well known for having betrayed its religion and country, so Ghulam Ahmad grew up loyal and obedient to the colonialists in every sense. Thus he was chosen for the role of a so-called prophet, so that the Muslims would gather around him and he would distract them from waging jihaad against the English colonialists. The British government did lots of favours for them, so they were loyal to the British. Ghulam Ahmad was known among his followers to be unstable, with a lot of health problems and dependent on drugs.


Among those who confronted him and his evil da’wah was Shaykh Abu’l-Wafa’ Thana’ al-Amritsari, the leader of Jama’iyyat Ahl al-Hadeeth fi ‘Umoom al-Hind (The All-India Society of Ahl al-Hadeeth). The Shaykh debated with him and refuted his arguments, revealing his ulterior motives and Kufr and the deviation of his way. When Ghulam Ahmad did not come to his senses, Shaykh Abu’l-Wafa’ challenged him to come together and invoke the curse of Allaah, such that the one who was lying would die in the lifetime of the one who was telling the truth. Only a few days passed before Mirza Ghulam Ahmad al-Qadiani died, in 1908 CE, leaving behind more than fifty books, pamphlets and articles, among the most important of which are: Izaalat al-Awhaam (Dispelling illusions), I’jaaz Ahmadi (Ahmadi miracles), Baraaheen Ahmadiyyah (Ahmadi proofs), Anwaar al-Islam (Lights of Islam), I’jaaz al-Maseeh (Miracles of the Messiah), al-Tableegh (Conveying (the message))and Tajalliyyaat Ilaahiyyah (Divine manifestations).


Noor al-Deen (Nuruddin): the first Khaleefah of the Qadianis. The British put the crown of Khilaafah on his head, so the disciples (of Ghulam Ahmad) followed him. Among his books is: Fasl al-Khitaab (Definitive statement).


Muhammad Ali and Khojah Kamaal al-Deen: the two leaders of the Lahore Qadianis. They are the ones who gave the final shape to the movement. The former produced a distorted translation into English of the Qur’aan. His other works include: Haqeeqat al-Ikhtilaaf (The reality of differences), al-Nubuwwah fi’l-Islam (Prophethood in Islam) and al-Deen al-Islami (The Islamic religion). As for Khojah Kamaal al-Deen, he wrote a book called al-Mathal al-A’laa fi’l-Anbiya’ (The highest example of the Prophets), and other books. This Lahore group of Ahmadis are those who think of Ghulam Ahmad as a Mujaddid (renewer or reviver of Islam) only, but both groups are viewed as a single movement because odd ideas that are not seen in the one will surely be found in the other.


Muhammad Ali: the leader of the Lahore Qadianis. He was one of those who gave the final shape to Qadianiyyah, a colonialist spy and the person in charge of the magazine which was the voice of the Qadianiyyah. He also produced a distorted translation into English of the Qur’aan. Among his works are Haqeeqat al-Ikhtilaaf (The reality of differences), and al-Nubuwwah fi’l-Islam (Prophethood in Islam), as stated above.


Muhammad Saadiq, the mufti of the Qadianiyyah. His works include: Khatim al-Nabiyyeen The seal of the Prophets).


Basheer Ahmad ibn Ghulam. His works include: Seerat al-Mahdi (the life of the Mahdi) and Kalimat al-Fasl (Decisive word).


Mahmood Ahmad ibn Ghulam, his second Khaleefah. Among his works are: Anwaar al-Khilaafah (Lights of the caliphate), Tuhfat al-Mulook and Haqeeqat al-Nubuwwah (The reality of prophethood).


The appointment of the Qadiani Zafar-Allaah Khan as the first Foreign Minister of Pakistan had a major effect in supporting this deviant sect, as he gave them a large area in the province of the Punjab to be their world headquarters, which they named Rabwah (high ground) as in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): “… And We gave them refuge on high ground (rabwah), a place of rest, security and flowing streams.” [al-Mu’minoon 23:50].


Their thought and beliefs


Ghulam Ahmad began his activities as an Islamic daa’iyah (caller to Islam) so that he could gather followers around him, then he claimed to be a mujaddid inspired by Allaah. Then he took a further step and claimed to be the Awaited Mahdi and the Promised Messiah. Then he claimed to be a Prophet and that his prophethood was higher than that of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).


The Qadianis believe that Allaah fasts, prays, sleeps, wakes up, writes, makes mistakes and has intercourse – exalted be Allaah far above all that they say.


The Qadiani believes that his god is English because he speaks to him in English.


The Qadianis believe that Prophethood did not end with Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), but that it is ongoing, and that Allaah sends a messenger when there is a need, and that Ghulam Ahmad is the best of all the Prophets.


They believe that Jibreel used to come down to Ghulam Ahmad and that he used to bring revelation to him, and that his inspirations are like the Qur’aan.


They say that there is no Qur’aan other than what the “Promised Messiah” (Ghulam Ahmad) brought, and no hadeeth except what is in accordance with his teachings, and no Prophet except under the leadership of Ghulam Ahmad.


They believe that their book was revealed. Its name is al-Kitaab al-Mubeen and it is different from the Holy Qur’aan.


They believe that they are followers of a new and independent religion and an independent Sharee’ah, and that the friends of Ghulam are like the Sahaabah.


They believe that Qadian is like Madeenah and Makkah, if not better than them, and that its land is sacred. It is their Qiblah and the place they make hajj to.


They called for the abolition of jihaad and blind obedience to the British government because, as they claimed, the British were “those in authority” as stated in the Qur’aan.


In their view every Muslim is a Kaafir unless he becomes a Qadiani, and everyone who married a non-Qadiani is also a kaafir.


They allow alcohol, opium, drugs and intoxicants.


Intellectual and ideological roots
The westernizing movement of Sir Sayyid Ahmad Khan paved the way for the emergence of the Qadianiyyah, because it had already spread deviant ideas.
The British made the most of this opportunity so they started the Qadiani movement and chose a man from a family that had a history of being agents of the colonialists.
In 1953 CE, there was a popular revolution in Pakistan which demanded the removal of Zafar-Allaah Khan from the position of Foreign Minister and that the Qadiani sect should be regarded as a non-Muslim minority. In this uprising around ten thousand Muslims were martyred, and they succeeded in having the Qadiani minister removed from office.
In Rabee’ al-Awwal 1394 AH (April 1974), a major conference was held by the Muslim World League in Makkah, which was attended by representatives of Muslim organizations from around the world. This conference announced that this sect is Kaafir and is beyond the pale of Islam, and told Muslims to resist its dangers and not to cooperate with the Qadianis or bury their dead in Muslim graveyards.
The Majlis al-Ummah in Pakistan (the central parliament) debated with the Qadiani leader Mirza Naasir Ahmad, and he was refuted by Shaykh Mufti Mahmood (may Allaah have mercy on him). The debate went on for nearly thirty hours but Naasir Ahmad was unable to give answers and the Kufr of this group was exposed, so the Majlis issued a statement that the Qadianis should be regarded as a non-Muslim minority.
Among the factors that make Mirza Ghulam Ahmad an obvious Kaafir are the following:


His claim to be a Prophet


His abolition of the duty of jihaad, to serve the interests of the colonialists.

His saying that people should no longer go on Hajj to Makkah, and his substitution of Qadian as the place of pilgrimage.

His anthropomorphism or likening Allaah to human beings.


His belief in the transmigration of souls and incarnation.


His attributing a son to Allaah and his claim to be the son of God.


His denying that Prophethood ended with Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his regarding the door of Prophethood to be open to “any Tom, Dick or Harry”.


The Qadianis have strong ties with Israel. Israel has opened centres and schools for them, and helped them to publish a magazine which is their mouthpiece, to print books and publications for distribution worldwide.
The fact that they are influenced by Judaism, Christianity and al-Baatiniyyah is clear from their beliefs and practices, even though they claim to be Muslims.
Their spread and positions of influence


Most of the Qadianis nowadays live in India and Pakistan, with a few in Israel and the Arab world. They are trying, with the help of the colonialists, to obtain sensitive positions in all the places where they live.


The Qadianis are very active in Africa and in some western countries. In Africa they have more than 5,000 teachers and dai’yahs working full-time to call people to Qadianiyyah. Their wide-spread activity proves that they have the support of the colonialists.


The British government is also supporting this movement and making it easy for their followers to get positions in world governments, corporate administration and consulates. Some of them are also high-ranking officers in the secret services.


In calling people to their beliefs, the Qadianis use all kinds of methods, especially educational means, because they are highly-educated and there are many scientists, engineers and doctors in their ranks. In Britain there is a satellite TV channel called Islamic TV which is run by the Qadianis.


From the above, it is clear that:
Qadianiyyah is a misguided group, which is not part of Islam at all. Its beliefs are completely contradictory to Islam, so Muslims should beware of their activities, since the ‘Ulama’ (scholars) of Islam have stated that they are Kaafirs.

The following statement was published by the Islamic Fiqh Council (Majma’ al-Fiqh al-Islami):
After discussing the question put to the Islamic Fiqh Council in Capetown, South Africa, concerning the ruling on the Qadianis and their off-shoot which is known as Lahoriyyah, and whether they should be counted as Muslims or not, and whether a non-Muslim is qualified to examine an issue of this nature:
In the light of research and documents presented to the members of the council concerning Mirza Ghulam Ahmad al-Qadiani, who emerged in India in the last century and to whom is attributed the Qadiani and Lahori movements, and after pondering the information presented on these two groups, and after confirming that Mirza Ghulam Ahmad claimed to be a prophet who received revelation, a claim which is documented in his own writings and speeches, some of which he claimed to have received as revelation, a claim which he propagated all his life and asked people to believe in, just as it is also well-known that he denied many other things which are proven to be essential elements of the religion of Islam
in the light of the above, the Council issued the following statement:
Firstly: the claims of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad to be a prophet or a messenger and to receive revelation are clearly a rejection of proven and essential elements of Islam, which unequivocally states that Prophethood ended with Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and that no revelation will come to anyone after him. This claim made by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad makes him and anyone who agrees with him an apostate who is beyond the pale of Islam. As for the Lahoriyyah, they are like the Qadianiyyah: the same ruling of apostasy applies to them despite the fact that they described Mirza Ghulam Ahmad as a shadow and manifestation of our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).
Secondly: it is not appropriate for a non-Muslim court or judge to give a ruling on who is a Muslim and who is an apostate, especially when this goes against the consensus of the scholars and organizations of the Muslim Ummah. Rulings of this nature are not acceptable unless they are issued by a Muslim scholar who knows all the requirements for being considered a Muslim, who knows when a person may be deemed to have overstepped the mark and become an apostate, who understands the realities of Islam and kufr, and who has comprehensive knowledge of what is stated in the Qur’aan, Sunnah and scholarly consensus. The ruling of a court of that nature is invalid. And Allaah knows best.

      immediately even if all the children are Ok about her having possession on the wealth
      until the end of her life. Also if my mother takes her share which is half (since she was an active
      partner in my fathers business) and distributes the rest of my fathers wealth according to
      shareeah, can she gift a part of her share to any of her children. To be more specific, if
      she favours one child by buying him a house with her share, will that house be distributed
      amongst all the children after her death. How can one prove that the mother gave the house
      as a gift and did not leave it behing to be distributed amongst the other children. Can
      she add this in her will. Must all the other children agree to this agreement and sign it
      etc...Please let me know soon.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The basic principle concerning the estate of 
  the deceased is that it should be shared out among the heirs after the person 
  has died, and after the funeral expenses and any outstanding debts to Allaah 
  (e.g., zakaah) and other people have been paid, and any specific bequests that 
  may have been made have been dealt with. It is disliked (makrooh) to delay sharing 
  out the estate, because of the harm that this may cause to the heirs, but if 
  all the heirs agree to delay it, there is nothing wrong with this. If your mother 
  was a partner in your father’s business, then she should take her share 
  of the company, then she is entitled to one-eighth of your father’s estate, 
  then with regard to you and your siblings, the males are entitled to the share 
  of two females, if the deceased’s parents are no longer alive. If you and 
  your mother want to leave everything as it is, and let the business continue 
  operating, there is nothing wrong with this; it is clear what each person’s 
  share is, and whenever one of you wants to ask for it, he may take it.
It is not permissible for the mother to give 
  something to one of her children and not the others, because of the hadeeth 
  narrated by al-Nu’maan ibn Basheer (may Allaah be pleased with him), who 
  said: “My father gave me some of his wealth as a gift, and my mother said, 
  ‘I will not accept this until you ask the Messenger of Allaah  
  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to be a witness to this.’ So 
  my father went to the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
  of Allaah be upon him) to ask him to be a witness to the gift, and the Messenger 
  of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
  him) said, ‘Have you done this for all your children?’ He said, ‘No.’ 
  He said, ‘Fear Allaah and treat all your children fairly.’ So my father 
  came back and took back the gift.” (Agreed upon).
For more detail on this topic and answers to 
  the rest of your question, please see Question #1151. 
  It is not permissible for a mother to bequeath anything to one of her heirs, 
  because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah

4094,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4094,Dealing With Evil Within Oneself,"What should one do if he sees that he has inherent evil in him; such that, the evil outweighs the good?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Man is a weak being, who feels inclinations towards both good and evil. He may be weak and be tempted to follow the path of immorality and deviation, and evil may push him to the way of wrongdoing and transgression. The Shaytaan may make evil deeds attractive to him, and justify every deviant action to him.
But the element of good may stir his conscience, make him feel regret and push him to come back to the truth and respond to the call of reason.
People vary with regard to their capability, willpower, purity of soul and spirituality. Some of them train themselves to follow the way of virtue, noble deeds and right attitudes, so they resist their desires and deviant inclinations, and make themselves adhere to the straight and right way. These people can confront evil and bear all kinds of hardship for that purpose. They never lose hope that good will prevail and evil will be defeated.
Others follow their desires and cannot adhere to what is right. They ignore many of the commands of Allaah and His Messenger, and are too weak to confront evil. So they have no hope that good will prevail. It all depends on whether or not a person is striving against his desires and his own self that bids him to do evil, so that he will receive guidance from Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“As for those who strive hard in Us (Our Cause), We will surely guide them to Our paths” [al-‘Ankaboot 29:69]
There follow some beautiful expressions of this striving, as uttered by Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allaah have mercy on him:
“O feet of patience, keep going, for what remains is only a little. Remember the sweetness of worship, then the bitterness of striving will become easier for you.”
(al-Fawaa’id)
“Go out to the field of struggle and strive to sow seeds. Irrigate the tree of regret with the water of tears…”
(Badaa’i’ al-Fawaa’id, 3/742)
“It was said: Love is sincerity in striving to obey the commands of Allaah and pure sincerity in following the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).”
(Tareeq al-Hijratayn, 1/460)
“Whoever gives up striving completely, his religious motives will become weak and his motive to follow his desires will become strong, but when he trains himself to go against his desires, he can defeat them whenever he wants.”
(‘Uddat al-Saabireen, 1/46)

      with people who are drinking alcohol is haraam, because Allaah has
      forbidden the Muslims to sit in gatherings where evil things are
      happening. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
 “And
      when you (Muhammad) see those who engage in a false conversation about Our
      Verses (of the Qur’aan) by mocking at them, stay away from them till
      they turn to another topic. And if Shaytaan (Satan) causes you to forget,

      are the Zaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers).

 “And
      it has already been revealed to you in the Book (this Qur’aan) that when
      you hear the Verses of Allaah being denied and mocked at, then sit not
      with them, until they engage in a talk other than that; (but if you stayed
      with them) certainly in that case you would be like them. Surely, Allaah
      will collect the hypocrites and disbelievers all together in Hell.”

 Some
      people who had been drinking wine were brought to ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd
      al-‘Azeez (may Allaah have mercy on him) and he commanded that they
      should be flogged. One of them offered the excuse that he had not actually
      been drinking, but ‘Umar commanded that he should be flogged along with
      the others, and he recited this aayah to him. And Allaah knows best.
 Concerning
      Abu Thawr, this is a brief glance at his biography:
