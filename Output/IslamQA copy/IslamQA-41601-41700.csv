Is it permissible for her to travel for Hajj?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The imams are agreed that it is not permissible for a woman whose husband has died to travel for Hajj during the ‘iddah period (mourning). 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about a woman who resolved to go for Hajj with her husband, but her husband died in Sha’baan – is it permissible for her to go for Hajj? 
He replied: 
She cannot travel for Hajj during the ‘iddah following her husband’s death, according to the view of the four Imams. End quote. 
Majmoo’ al-Fataawa (34/29). 
Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
A woman who is in mourning cannot travel for Hajj, as is the view of the four Imams. With regard to what you say about only have leave during that time, this is not a shar’i justification that makes it permissible to travel with a woman who is still in the mourning period. End quote.

41620,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/41620,Brief ruling on the “Business” company,"I have been offered the opportunity to subscribe to the “Business” program [a kind of multi-level marketing or pyramid scheme], but I am a little hesitant because of the ambiguity involved. I would like to know whether it is permissible for me to join this program or not.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Joining the company mentioned and other 
    similar companies is not permissible because that involves gambling and deceiving those who subscribe to it, pushing people to buy something they 
    do not need and consuming wealth unlawfully; it also involves ambiguity, deceit and unfair transactions. 
If we were to ask honestly what is the 
    purpose of most of those who join the “Business” scheme – is it to benefit from the software programs to be found in the first stage of the 
    operation? Or to get involved in marketing in order to make a lot of money quickly in the second stage? – 
The answer will undoubtedly be that the 
    purpose of most of them is to get involved in marketing, and the amount of one hundred dollars which they pay in the hope of earning money from 
    marketing is like betting and gambling. The subscriber pays one hundred dollars but he does not know how much he will get in return for this 
    hundred, a lot or a little, sooner or later. 
Moreover if the contract is presented in this 
    manner this involves tempting many unsophisticated people who join the scheme in the hope that they will be able to recruit enough people to earn 
    commission. 
One of them complained to me that he made the 
    mistake of paying 40,000 riyaals to make a large number of contracts in his name with different passwords, then he found that what he earned was 
    not enough to pay off the loans that he had taken in order to join this “Business” company. 
This eagerness that we see in the large number of young people who join this company in the 
    hopes of getting rich quickly makes us wonder about the soundness of this transaction. Even if some of them manage to make a lot of money, this is 
    at the expense of other unsophisticated people who will come to them as customers. Ultimately they will never find people to come after them to 
    increase the size of their own pyramid. How can a believer agree to get rich at the expense of his Muslim brothers’ wealth? 
In order to solve this problem, the company has invented a new trick which tempts those poor 
    people (who lost money and did not gain anything) and recruit them back so that they will gain more and more money at the expense of those people. 
    This is done renewing their subscription in return for a new amount of money after a year has passed since the original contract, and so on. 
They sweeten this deceit with the promise of new programs and new publications of the original 
    program with the renewal (of the subscription), but without giving a specific number of programs or new publications.

Is fasting on the day of `Eid permissible?","Praise be to Allah.
Is it recommended to fast 9 days of Dhul-Hijjah?
Fasting nine days of Dhul-Hijjah is recommended. This is indicated by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), as narrated in the hadeeth of Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him): 
“There are no days on which righteous deeds are more beloved to Allah than these ten days – i.e., ten days of Dhul-Hijjah).” They said: “O Messenger of Allah, not even jihad for the sake of Allah?” He said: “Not even jihad for the sake of Allah, unless a man goes out himself with his wealth and does not come back with anything (i.e., he expends all his wealth and is martyred).” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 969)
And it was narrated from Hunaydah ibn Khalid from his wife that one of the wives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to fast nine days of Dhul-Hijjah and the day of ‘Ashura’ and three days of each month – the first Monday and two Thursdays.” (Narrated by Imam Ahmad, 21829; Abu Dawood, 2437; classed as da’eef in Nasb al-Raayah, 2/180, but classed as saheeh by al-Albani.) 
Is fasting on the day of `Eid permissible?
With regard to fasting on the day of ‘Eid , this is haram (prohibited), as is indicated by the marfoo’ hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him): “He [the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)] forbade fasting on the day of ‘Eid) al-Fitr and the day of al-Nahr (the day of sacrifice, i.e., ‘Eid al-Adha).” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, no. 1992; Muslim, 827) 
The scholars are unanimously agreed that it is haram to fast on these days. 
Righteous deeds on these ten days  are better than on others. With regard to fasting, that should only be done on nine of them; the tenth day is the day of ‘Eid when it is haram to fast. 
Based on this, what is meant by the virtue of fasting the ten days of Dhul-Hijjah is fasting nine days only, even though they are called ten days.

41643,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/41643,Should we place green leaves on graves so that the punishment of the deceased may be reduced?,"I heard in a hadeeth that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) placed two leaves on two graves whose occupants were being tormented, so that the punishment might be reduced, but I do not understand the reason for that. Is it prescribed for us to do likewise?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
Yes, it is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) passed by two graves and said: “They are being punished but they are not being punished for something that was difficult to avoid [?}.” Then he said, “One of them used to go about spreading malicious gossip, and the other used not to take precautions to avoid being contaminated with urine.” Then he took a fresh branch, broke it in two and planted each piece on a grave. Then he said: “May their punishment be reduced so long as this does not dry out.” 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1378; Muslim, 292. 
This indicates that the punishment may be reduced, but what is the relationship between these two branches and the reduction of these punishments for these two persons? 
1 – It was said that the branches glorify Allah (by saying “Subhaan-Allah” i.e., tasbeeh) so long as they do not dry out, and tasbeeh reduces the punishment of the deceased. Based on this they reached the conclusion – which far-fetched – that it is Sunnah for a person to go to the grave and recite tasbeeh so that the punishment of the deceased might be reduced. 
2 – Some of the scholars said: This reason is da’eef (weak) because the two branches would recite tasbeeh whether they were fresh or dry, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The seven heavens and the earth and all that is therein, glorify Him and there is not a thing but glorifies His Praise. But you understand not their glorification”
[al-Isra’ 17:44]
Pebbles in the hands of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) were heard to recite tasbeeh even though pebbles are dry, so how are we to understand the hadeeth? 
We may understand it as meaning that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) hoped that Allah would reduce their punishment so long as these two branches remained fresh, so it was not a long period. This was so as to warn against doing what they did, because their actions were serious as it says in the report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “But it is serious.” 
One of them did not take precautions to avoid being contaminated by urine, and if he was not free of such contamination then he was praying without being pure. 
The other used to walk about spreading malicious gossip, causing mischief among the slaves of Allah and stirring up enmity and hatred among them. This is a serious matter. 
This is the most likely understanding of the meaning of the hadeeth, that it was a temporary intercession and a warning to the ummah, not because the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wanted to offer ongoing intercession.  
Secondly: 
Some scholars – may Allah forgive them – say that it is Sunnah to place a fresh branch, etc on the grave so that the punishment might be reduced. But this understanding is very far-fetched, and it is not permissible for us to do that for several reasons. 
(i) We do not know that this man is being punished, unlike the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) whom Allah told by means of Revelation about the situation of those two graves.
(ii) If we do that, we are mistreating the deceased, because we are thinking badly of him and assuming that he is being punished, but we do not know that. It may be that he is being blessed, or it may be that this deceased person is one of those whom Allah blessed with forgiveness before he died because of one of the many things that bring forgiveness, so he died having been forgiven by the Lord of all people, in which case he would not deserve to be punished.
(iii) This understanding is contrary to the way of the righteous salaf. This action was not part of their way and they were the most knowledgeable of people about the sharee’ah of Allah.
(iv) Allah has shown us something that is better than that. When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) finished burying someone he would stand over the grave and say, “Pray for forgiveness for your brother and ask that he be made steadfast, for even now is he being questioned.”

41663,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/41663,He died and did not perform Hajj because he was negligent – can someone perform Hajj on his behalf?,"There is a person who died in his 40s. He was able to do Hajj, and he prayed all five prayers regularly. He used to say each year, “I will go for Hajj this year,” but then he died. He has heirs – can they perform Hajj on his behalf? Is there any sin on him?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The scholars differed concerning such cases. Some of them 
    said that others may perform Hajj on his behalf and that will benefit him, 
    and it will be as if he did Hajj for himself. Others said that no one can 
    perform Hajj on his behalf, and even if people performed Hajj on his behalf 
    a thousand times, it would not be accepted and would not discharge his duty. 
    This view is correct, because this man failed to do an act of worship that 
    was obligatory for him and should have been done straight away, with no 
    excuse. So how can we make it up for him after his death after he neglected 
    it? Now the estate has to do with the rights of the heirs – how can we 
    deprive them of the costs of this Hajj, when it is not going to be accepted? 
    This is what Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) mentioned in 
    Tahdheeb al-Sunan and this is also my view. If a person fails to do Hajj 
    out of negligence when he is able to do it, no Hajj will ever count for him, 
    even if the people do Hajj on his behalf a thousand times.  

    As for zakaah, there are some scholars who say that if a 
    person dies and zakaah is paid on his behalf, that is sufficient, but the 
    basic principle that I have mentioned implies that it does not discharge his 
    duty of paying zakaah. But I think that the zakaah may be paid from the 
    estate, because it has to do with the rights of the poor and those who are 
    entitled to zakaah, unlike Hajj, the cost of which cannot be taken from the 
    estate, because it does not have to do with anybody’s rights, whereas zakaah 
    has to do with people’s rights. So zakaah should be given to those who are 
    entitled to it, but that does not discharge the person’s duty, and he will 
    be given the punishment of those who do not pay zakaah. We ask Allaah to 
    keep us safe and sound.  

    The same applies to fasting. If it is known that this person 
    did not fast and was negligent in making it up, then it cannot be made up on 
    his behalf, because he was negligent and failed to do this act of worship, 
    which is one of the pillars of Islam, with no excuse. If it is made up on 
    his behalf it will not benefit him. The hadeeth of the Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “Whoever dies owing fasts, his heir 
    should fast on his behalf,” applies to one who has not been negligent, and 
    with regard to the one who failed to make up missed fasts out of negligence 
    with no legitimate shar’i excuse, what is the point of making it up on his 
    behalf? End quote.","Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 21/226"

    These crimes, which are committed by some people who have no 
    religious commitment, are given a severe punishment in sharee’ah, which is 
    known to the scholars as the hadd for haraabah (waging war against 
    Allaah and His Messenger) or quta’ al-tareeq (banditry). This is 
    mentioned in the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “The recompense of those who wage war against Allaah and 
    His Messenger and do mischief in the land is only that they shall be killed 
    or crucified or their hands and their feet be cut off from opposite sides, 
    or be exiled from the land. That is their disgrace in this world, and a 
    great torment is theirs in the Hereafter”

    [al-Maa’idah 5:33]
The Council of Senior 
    Scholars in the Land of the Two Holy Sanctuaries, under the leadership of 
    Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) issued a 
    statement concerning these crimes, in which it says: 

    The Council has studied what the scholars have mentioned 
    about the shar’i rulings which in general dictate the obligation to protect 
    the five essentials of life and ensure that they remain safe. They are: 
    religion, life, honour, mental health and wealth. Islam acknowledges the 
    great danger that can result from crimes of aggression against the sanctity 
    of the Muslims’ lives, honour and wealth, and the threat to public security 
    that this can pose in the land. 

    Allaah has guaranteed protection for the people’s religion, 
    physical well-being, lives, honour and mental health by means of the 
    punishments which He has prescribed to attain security on both the public 
    and private levels. Implementing the verse concerning the hadd punishment 
    for haraabah in accordance with the rulings of the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) concerning muhaaribeen guarantees security 
    and peace of mind, and deters those who would think of committing such 
    crimes and transgressing against the Muslims. 

    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “The recompense of those who wage war against Allaah and 
    His Messenger and do mischief in the land is only that they shall be killed 
    or crucified or their hands and their feet be cut off from opposite sides, 
    or be exiled from the land. That is their disgrace in this world, and a 
    great torment is theirs in the Hereafter”

    [al-Maa’idah 5:33]

    In al-Saheehayn it is narrated that Anas (may Allaah 
    be pleased with him) said: Some people from ‘Ukl came to the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and were in al-Suffah. The 
    climate of Madeenah made them sick, so they said: O Messenger of Allaah, get 
    us some milk. He said: “I think the best thing for you is to go to the 
    camels of the Messenger of Allaah.” So they went there and drank some of 
    their milk and urine, then when they had recovered and gained weight, they 
    killed the herdsman and drove away the camels. Someone came to the Messenger 
    of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) shouting for 
    help, and he sent a party out in pursuit of them. Not much of the day had 
    passed before they were caught and brought to him. He ordered that branding 
    irons be heated and their eyes were put out, and their hands and feet were 
    cut off, and not cauterized, then they were thrown into the harrah where 
    they asked for water but they were not given any, until they died. 

    Abu Qilaabah said: They stole, killed and waged war against 
    Allaah and His Messenger. 

    Based on the above, the Council has determined the 
    following: 

    (a)  

    The crimes of kidnapping, robbery and transgression of the 
    Muslims’ sanctity by way of open and audacious hostility is a type of 
    muhaarabah (waging war against Allaah and His Messenger) and doing mischief 
    in the land, which deserves the punishment mentioned by Allaah in the verse 
    in al-Maa’idah, whether that aggression is against people’s lives, wealth or 
    honour, or it is scaring wayfarers and cutting off routes (banditry). It 
    makes no difference whether that happens in cities, villages, the desert or 
    the wilderness, as is the correct view of the scholars (may Allaah have 
    mercy on them). 

    Ibn al-‘Arabi said, telling of the time when he was a judge: 
    Some bandits were brought before me who had gone out to attack a group of 
    travellers. They took a woman by force from her husband and the group of 
    Muslims who were with him, and carried her off. Then they were hunted down, 
    caught and brought to me. I asked one of the muftis with whom Allaah tested 
    me about them and he said that they were not muhaaribeen, because haraabah 
    (the crime of waging war against Allaah and His Messenger) applies only with 
    regard to wealth, not rape! I said to them: To Allaah we belong and unto Him 
    is our return (said by Muslims at times of calamity). Do you not know that 
    haraabah (aggression) against honour is worse than aggression against 
    wealth? All people would agree to lose their wealth and have it confiscated 
    from them rather than to see aggression committed against their wives or 
    daughters. If there were any punishment more severe than that which Allaah 
    has mentioned, it would be for those who kidnap women. end quote. 

    (b) 

    The Council believes that in the verse in which Allaah says “The 
    recompense of those who wage war against Allaah and His Messenger and do 
    mischief in the land is only that they shall be killed or crucified or their 
    hands and their feet be cut off from opposite sides, or be exiled from the 
    land” the word aw (or) means that there is a choice, as is the 
    apparent meaning of the verse. This is the view of the majority of scholars, 
    may Allaah have mercy on them. 

    (c) 

    The majority of the Council believes that the deputies of the 
    ruler – the judges – have the obligation to prove the type of crime and to 
    pass judgement accordingly. If it is proven that it is a crime that 
    constitutes war against Allaah and His Messenger (muhaarabah) and spreading 
    mischief in the land, then they have the choice of issuing a sentence of 
    execution, crucifixion, cutting off a hand and foot on opposite sides, or 
    exile from the land, based on their ijtihaad and paying attention to the 
    situation of the criminal and the circumstances of the crime, as well as its 
    impact on society and what may best achieve the interests of Islam and the 
    Muslims, unless the muhaarib has killed, in which case he should definitely 
    be executed, as Ibn al-‘Arabi al-Maaliki narrated that there was consensus 
    among the scholars on this point. Among the Hanbalis, the author of 
    al-Insaaf said: There is no dispute on this point. End quote from a

1 – Some friends and I go and visit people in their homes and on the sea and on the street to remind them of Allaah and call them with that which is better. Is this action incorrect, and is it regarded as visiting people for the sake of Allaah, because that is our intention? 

2 – Sometimes my brothers in Islam and I go to Africa and many countries to call people to Islam, and they turn to Islam in an amazing manner, and they are even moved by our appearance, let alone when we speak to them. How sound is this action, given that some people say that this is bid’ah and that we should have a great deal of knowledge, even though the people there do not know anything about Islam, and if we simply call them and explain the religion to them they become Muslim? 

3 – What is the ruling on going out for da’wah for the sake of Allaah and freeing up one's time for that, even though some people told me that I should not go out with the people who do da’wah because they are innovators, although I have not noticed anything like that, rather what I have seen with my own eyes is that they are reviving the Sunnahs of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and holding dhikr circles and study circles to teach the Sunnahs of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) from Riyadh al-Saaliheen and encouraging people to pray qiyaam al-layl etc. Please advise us, may Allaah reward you with good.",,,"Praise be to Allah.

    it.” Narrated by Muslim, 133. 

    If by doing this work you intend to visit others for the sake

    2 – Do not let the blame of anyone put you off from doing

    knowledge and insight, as appears to be the case from what you say. 

    3 – If the people you mention are known to have sound 
    ‘aqeedah and knowledge, and are known for their good conduct and attitude, 
    then there is nothing wrong with cooperating with them in da’wah and going 
    out with them, whether that is for a short time or a long time, because

    (i.e. Islam) with wisdom (i.e. with the Divine Revelation and the Qur’aan) 
    and fair preaching, and argue with them in a way that is better”

    [al-Nahl 16:125]

    And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said to ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him) when he sent him to 
    Khaybar to call the Jews to Islam: “By Allaah, if Allaah were to guide one 
    man through you, that would be better for you than having red camels [the 
    best kind].” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3701; Muslim, 2406 

    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    sent daa’iyahs (callers) to Yemen and to many of the Arab tribes. 

    Many members of this group with whom you are going out are 
    lacking in Islamic knowledge, and they may hold some false beliefs, but this 
    should not prevent you from going out with them and calling people to 
    Allaah; rather you should go out with them and explain the truth to them, 
    and teach them what they do not know of the Sunnah, and advise them to give 
    up the innovations that they do. Perhaps Allaah will benefit them through 
    you. 

    And Allaah knows best.

41693,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/41693,She has committed haraam actions with her fiancé,"I am a Muslim girl. I pray and I fear my Lord a great deal, but I have a problem. I know a person who came and proposed marriage to me. My father agrees but he always postpones the matter because of family reasons. We cannot be patient and the more time goes by, the more I find myself attached to him. He used to ask me to meet him often, and we have met more than once. We spoke together and kissed one another as if we were married, and even touched one another. I know that this is haraam and is wrong. Every time that happens I end up arguing with him and get angry with myself. I asked my Lord for forgiveness and I prayed Istikhaarah, asking whether this person is right for me or not. Every time I tell him that we should only meet in permissible ways, but then we make the same mistake. I want a solution. Please help me.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
You say in your question that you regularly observe the five daily prayers and that you fear Allaah a great deal. We hope that you will be fine, and we ask Allaah to make you steadfast in faith and in doing righteous deeds, and to keep evil and corruption far away from you. 
Secondly: 
Islam has blocked all the ways that may lead to committing immoral actions. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Come not near to Al-Fawaahish (shameful sins and illegal sexual intercourse) whether committed openly or secretly”
[al-An’aam 6:151]
“Coming near” implies doing something that may lead to those actions. Islam also warns against men mixing freely with women. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Beware of entering upon women.” They said: O Messenger of Allaah, what about the in-law? He said: “The in-law is death.” Agreed upon. 
“In-law” refers to the husband’s relatives, his brothers, uncles, cousins, etc. 
Islam also warns us against being alone with a non-mahram woman. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No man is alone with a (non-mahram) woman but the Shaytaan is the third one present.” Narrated by Ahmad, al-Tirmidhi and al-Haakim; al-Albaani said: It is saheeh. Saheeh al-Jaami’, no. 2546. 
All of this is for the purpose of protecting people’s honour against committing immoral actions, and blocking all paths that may lead to the crime of zina (fornication, adultery). 
Thirdly: 
The fiancé is a “stranger” (non-mahram) to his fiancée until the marriage contract has been done. So your going out with this non-mahram man, kissing him, meeting him and the other things that you mention are all haraam. Fear Allaah and refuse to meet him until the marriage contract has been done, and be frank with him about that. 
See also questions no. 2572 and 23432. 
Fourthly: 
If this person sees that you are determined and righteous, this will make him more keen to marry you, because he will see that you have a strong personality and that you do not give in to your emotions.  Who would not want his wife to have a strong personality and be keen to protect her honour? That will affect him and make him change his ways and become more righteous, and you will be the cause of that.  
Fifthly: 
Put your trust in Allaah and make a lot of du’aa’, especially at the times when prayers are answered. Be patient and remind yourself of that which Allaah has prepared for those who are patient, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Only those who are patient shall receive their reward in full, without reckoning”
[al-Zumar 39:10]
Sixthly: 
We remind you that Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Follow not the footsteps of Shaytaan (Satan). And whosoever follows the footsteps of Shaytaan (Satan), then, verily, he commands Al-Fahsha’ [i.e. to commit indecency (illegal sexual intercourse)], and Al-Munkar [disbelief and polytheism (i.e. to do evil and wicked deeds; and to speak or to do what is forbidden in Islam)]. And had it not been for the Grace of Allaah and His Mercy on you, not one of you would ever have been pure from sins. But Allaah purifies (guides to Islam) whom He wills, and Allaah is All-Hearer, All-Knower”
[al-Noor 24:21]
The Shaytaan gradually calls people to falsehood; before a Muslim commits zina, the Shaytaan draws him towards it by his being alone with a woman, and speaking to her, then kissing her, then meeting her in haraam ways, then the great evil which is zina – we seek refuge with Allaah. 
As the saying goes: A look, then a smile, then a greeting, then speaking, then an appointment, then a meeting. 
Seventhly: 
You should avoid blind trust in anyone. How many women and girls have said, “My fiancé is decent, he is not what people think”? Then they fell victim to their naïveté. So you should not think of him in a positive way, rather you should be extremely cautious and careful. 
Eighthly: 
You should think carefully about this husband and find out more about him, because he is going to be your life partner. Is he fit to be your life partner even though he has tried to do something haraam and persisted in that? 
Ninthly: 
Try to find out what obstacles and problems are making your father postpone this marriage, and talk to him about the matter. If you cannot address him directly, then you can bring in someone who has an influence over him, whether that is your mother or your brothers, or any person who has any status in your father’s eyes and can urge him to hasten to do the marriage contract and explain to him the danger of a woman being left without a husband, especially as she grows older, because the opportunity may not come again, and can remind him of the bad consequences if he is careless in this matter. 
Some guardians – may Allaah guide them – exaggerate about family problems, even simple ones, and make them an obstacle to proceeding with matters such as marriage; others may suffer as a result but they do not care about that or pay attention to their responsibilities.  
And finally: 
We ask Allaah to guide you to all that is good, and we ask Him to guide your fiancé and to make it easy for you to do that which pleases Him, for He is Able to do that. 
May Allaah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon all his family and companions.",Islam Q&A
41696,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/41696,Is It Obligatory to Take a Loan to Offer Udhyah?,Is it obligatory to take out a loan in order to buy the udhiyah?,"According to the view that udhiyah is obligatory and the view that it is mustahabb, there is no need to take out a loan to buy the udhiyah because it is not obligatory for one who cannot afford. However, it is mustahabb to take out a loan if there is the hope that one can pay it back.","Is udhiyh compulsory? 


Is it obligatory to take a loan to offer udhyah?


Is it recommended to take a loan to offer udhiyah?","Praise be to Allah.Is udhiyh compulsory? 
In the answer to question no. 36432  we stated that the scholars differed concerning the ruling on udhiyah and whether it is obligatory or mustahabb. 
Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:  
“There is nothing in the Shar’i evidence to indicate that it is obligatory. The view that it is obligatory is a weak view.” (Majmu’ Fatawa Ibn Baz, 18/36)
Moreover, those who say that udhiyah is obligatory state that being rich is a condition of it being obligatory.  (See Hashiyat Ibn ‘Abidin, 9/452) 
Is it obligatory to take a loan to offer udhyah?
According to both opinions – the view that udhiyah is obligatory and the view that it is mustahabb – there is no need to take out a loan in order to buy the sacrificial animal, because it is not obligatory for one who is not rich, according to scholarly consensus. 
Is it recommended to take a loan to offer udhiyah?
Then there remains the question: is it mustahabb to take out a loan or not? 
The answer is that it is mustahabb to take out a loan if there is the hope that one can pay it back , such as if a person has a job and takes out a loan until he gets his salary at the end of the month. But if there is no hope of paying it off, then it is better not to take out a loan, because then he is taking on a commitment for something that he is not obliged to do. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about a person who is not able to offer the udhiyah – should he take out a loan? 
He replied: 
“If he can repay and he takes out a loan so that he can offer a sacrifice, that is good, but he is not obliged to do that.” (Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 26/305) 
However, Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) was of the view that udhiyah is obligatory. 
Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Is the sacrifice obligatory for one who cannot afford it? Is it permissible to buy the sacrifice on credit until a person gets his salary?  
He replied: 
“The sacrifice (udhiyah ) is Sunnah and is not obligatory… there is no sin on a Muslim taking out a loan to offer the sacrifice if he is able to repay it.” (Fatawa Ibn Baz, 1/37)

41697,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/41697,Can Istikharah be Done Any Time?,Can istikharah prayer be performed at the time when prayer is not allowed?,"If istikharah has to do with an immediate matter that cannot be delayed until the time when prayer is not allowed is over, then it may be done. If istikharah is for something that may be delayed, then it must be delayed.","Forbidden prayer times


Can Istikharah be done at any time?","Praise be to Allah.Forbidden prayer times
In the answers to questions no. 306 , 8818 , and 20013 , we have stated the times at which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade prayer. What is meant by this forbidding is general nafl prayers for which there is no reason. 
As for nafl prayers for which there is a reason, such as greeting the mosque, they may be offered at these times when prayer is not allowed. 
The scholars differed concerning istikharah prayer and whether it is regarded as a prayer for which there is a reason, or not. 
The correct view is that if istikharah is done for something that is immediate and cannot be delayed, then this prayer may be performed at a time when prayer is not allowed , such as if a person wants to travel after ‘Asr prayer. But if the matter is not immediate and the prayer can be delayed until after the time when prayer is not allowed is over, then it should not be performed at that time. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in al-Fatawa al-Kubra (5/345): 
“Regular Sunnah prayers may be made up, and prayers for which there is a reason may be done during the times when prayer is not allowed. This is one of the two views narrated from Ahmad, and is the view favoured by a number of our companions and others. Istikharah prayer may be performed at the time when prayer is not allowed with regard to something that is immediate and cannot be delayed until the time when prayer is permitted. 
It is mustahabb to offer two rak’ahs immediately after doing wudu, even if that is at a time when prayer is not allowed. This is the view of al-Shafi’i.”
Can Istikharah be done at any time?
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Can a person pray istikharah at a time when prayer is not allowed? 
He replied: 
“If istikharah has to do with an immediate matter that cannot be delayed until the time when prayer is not allowed is over, then it may be done. If it is for something that may be delayed, then it must be delayed.” (Majmu’ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 14/275)
