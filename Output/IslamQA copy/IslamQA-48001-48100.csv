48005,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/48005,Entering into a partnership with a person who deals with bribes and riba,"There is a businessman who was offered money by a man in order to do business for him, but the one who offered this money deals with bribes and riba. Is there any sin on this businessman?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly:
If a person earns money in haraam ways such as riba, bribes, stealing and cheating, etc., and his wealth is a combination of halaal and haraam, then it is valid to do business with him, buying and selling and entering into partnerships, but it is makrooh. If it is known that the product in which the trade is to be done is haraam in and of itself, then it is not permissible to enter into a partnership with him or work with him in that business.
Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni (4/180):
If he buys from someone whose wealth includes both haraam and halaal, such as an unjust ruler or someone who deals in riba, if it is known that the item sold is from the halaal portion of his wealth, then it is halaal, but if it is known that (the item) is from the haraam portion, then it is haraam. If it is not known which it is, then we regard it as makrooh, because of the possibility that it may be haraam, but the sale is not invalid, because of the possibility that it may be halaal, whether the haraam element is small or great. In this case it is a doubtful matter. The lesser or greater the haraam element, the greater or lesser the doubt. End quote.
It says in Haashiyat Qalyoobi wa ‘Umayrah (2/418):
Partnerships are valid even if they are makrooh, such as a partnership with a dhimmi (a non-Muslim living under Muslim ruler), one who consumes riba and one whose wealth is mostly haraam. End quote.
In Haashiyat al-Dasooqi (3/277) it says:
Know that if a person’s wealth is mostly halaal and a small part of it is haraam, the correct view is that it is permissible to deal with him, lend money to him and eat from his wealth as Ibn al-Qaasim said, contrary to the view of Usbugh who says that that is haraam.
But if a person’s wealth is mostly haraam and a small part of it is halaal, the view of Ibn al-Qaasim is that it is makrooh to deal with him, lend money to him and eat from his wealth. This is the correct view, contrary to the view of Usbugh who says that that is haraam.
But if a person’s wealth is all haraam, this means that it is not allowed to deal with him, lend money to him or have any dealings with him, financial or otherwise. End quote.
Secondly:
What you have to do before entering into a partnership with such a person is advise him and encourage him to repent and give up wrongdoing. Strive to find a good source of income, for Paradise is good and none will enter it but those who are good. Warn him against continuing to consume haraam wealth, for every body that is nourished from haraam sources, the Fire is more fitting for it.

48008,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/48008,Is Keeping Birds in Cages Haram?,Is it permissible to keep birds in cages?,Keeping birds in cages is not haram if that is to enjoy looking at them or listening to their voices subject to the condition that you give them food and drink.,"Is keeping birds in cages haram?


Is selling birds for the sake of their voices permissible?","Praise be to Allah.Is keeping birds in cages haram?
It is permissible to keep pretty birds and the like in cages, especially if that is to enjoy looking at them or listening to their voices, subject to the condition that you give them food and drink. 
It is proven in al-Sahihayn (al-Bukhari, 5778; Muslim, 2150) that the brother of Anas ibn Malik through his mother was called Abu ‘Umayr and he had a bird whose name was al-nughayr. The bird died and the child grieved for it, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) tried to cheer him up by saying, “O Abu ‘Umayr, what happened to al-nughayr?” 
The nughayr is a small bird like a sparrow, or it was said that it is a nightingale. 
This hadith is taken as evidence that it is permissible to keep birds , because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not denounce Abu ‘Umayr for doing so. (Fath al-Bari, 10/548) 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: 
What is the ruling on one who collects birds and keeps them in a cage in order for his children to enjoy looking at them? 
He replied: 
“There is nothing wrong with collecting birds and keeping them in a cage in order for the children to enjoy looking at them, so long as one gives them what they need of food and drink. The basic principle concerning this matter is that it is permitted, and there is no evidence to the contrary as far as we know. And Allah is the Source of strength.” (Fatawa ‘Ulama al-Balad al-Haram, p. 1793)
Is selling birds for the sake of their voices permissible?
The scholars of the Standing Committee said: 
“Selling pretty birds – such as parrots, other colourful birds and nightingales – for the sake of their voices is permissible, because looking at them and listening to their voices is something that is permissible.
There is no text in Islam to say that it is haram to sell them or keep them. Rather there are texts which may be taken to mean that it is permissible to keep them so long as one gives them food and drink and does whatever they need. 
For example, al-Bukhari narrated that Anas said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was the best of people in attitude, and I had a brother called Abu ‘Umayr. I think he was already weaned, and when he (the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)) came he would say, “O Abu ‘Umayr, what happened to al-nughayr?” – a nightingale with which he used to play… The nightingale is a kind of bird. 
Al-Hafiz ibn Hajar said in his commentary Fath al-Bari, among his list of the things that we learn from this hadith: … It is permissible for young children to play with birds, and it is permissible for parents to allow their children to play with things with which it is permissible to play, and it is permissible to spend money on permissible things which will amuse young children, and it is permissible to keep birds in cages and the like, and to clip the birds of wings – because one of the two must have applied in the case of Abu ‘Umayr’s bird, and whichever was the case, the ruling also applies to the other. Similarly it was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “A woman entered the Fire because of a cat which she kept and did not give it food or water, nor did she set it free to eat of the vermin of the earth.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari in al-Saheeh)
If this is permissible in the case of cats , then it is also permissible in the case of birds and the like. 
Some of the scholars are of the view that it is makruh to keep them, and some disallowed that and said: Because man has no need to listen to their voices or enjoy looking at them. Rather this is a kind of extravagance and luxury, and it is also foolishness because he is enjoying the voice of a bird who is longing to fly free, as it says in al-Furu’ wa Tashihuhu, 4/9; and al-Insaf, 4/275.” (Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz, Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz Al al-Shaykh, Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan, Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd. Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 13/38-40)

48027,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/48027,Sincerity in Hajj,"How can the pilgrim be sincere towards Allah in performing the rituals? If he wants to do business and seek to earn a living as well as doing Hajj, does that mean that he is not being sincere towards Allah?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Sincerity (ikhlaas) is a necessary condition in all acts of worship, and no act of worship is valid if anything or anyone is associated with Allah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So whoever hopes for the Meeting with his Lord, let him work righteousness and associate none as a partner in the worship of his Lord” [al-Kahf 18:110] 
“And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allah, and worship none but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him), and perform As‑Salaah (Iqaamat‑as‑Salaah) and give Zakaah, and that is the right religion” [al-Bayyinah 98: 5] 
“So worship Allah (Alone) by doing religious deeds sincerely for Allah’s sake only.
3. Surely, the religion (i.e. the worship and the obedience) is for Allah only” [al-Zumar 39:2-3]
According to a saheeh hadeeth qudsi, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, says: ‘I am so self-sufficient that I am in no need of having an associate. Thus he who does an action for someone else’s sake as well as Mine will have that action renounced by Me to him whom he associated with Me.’” 
What is meant by sincerity towards Allah in worship is that nothing motivates the person to do that act of worship except love and veneration for Allah, and the hope for His reward and pleasure. Hence Allah says of Muhammad the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): 
“Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. And those who are with him are severe against disbelievers, and merciful among themselves. You see them bowing and falling down prostrate (in prayer), seeking Bounty from Allah and (His) Good Pleasure”
[al-Fath 48:29 – interpretation of the meaning]
 No act of worship, whether it is Hajj or anything else, will be accepted if a person is doing it to show off to other people, or he is doing it so that other people will see him and say, “How pious So and so is, how much he worships Allah” and so on. 
No worship will be accepted if the motivation behind it is to see places or see people, or other such things that are contrary to sincerity. Hence the pilgrims who go to the Sacred House must make their intention sincerely for the sake of Allah and not make it their intention to see the Muslim world, or to do business, or so that it will be said that So and so goes for Hajj every year, and so on. 
There is nothing wrong with a person seeking the bounty of Allah by doing business whilst travelling to the Sacred House, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“There is no sin on you if you seek the Bounty of your Lord (during pilgrimage by trading)” [al-Baqarah 2:198]
What goes against sincerity is when a person’s only intention is to business and earn money. This is a person who seeks worldly gain by doing actions that have to do with the Hereafter. This means that the act of worship is invalid or that it is sorely lacking. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Whosoever desires (by his deeds) the reward of the Hereafter, We give him increase in his reward, and whosoever desires the reward of this world (by his deeds), We give him thereof (what is decreed for him), and he has no portion in the Hereafter” [al-Shoora 42:20]","Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 21/18"
