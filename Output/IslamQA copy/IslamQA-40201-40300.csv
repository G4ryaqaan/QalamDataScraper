40204,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/40204,It is permissible to remove janaabah by means of tayammum when there is an excuse for that,Is it permissible to remove janaabah by means of tayammum?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.If there is a reason for doing tayammum – such as non-availability of water, or being unable to use it because of sickness etc – then tayammum takes the place of wudu and ghusl. So the person who is junub should do tayammum and pray, then when he finds water he has to do ghusl. 
This is indicated by the Quran and Sunnah. 
1 – Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! When you intend to offer As-Salah (the prayer), wash your faces and your hands (forearms) up to the elbows, rub (by passing wet hands over) your heads, and (wash) your feet up to the ankles. If you are in a state of Janaaba (i.e. after a sexual discharge), purify yourselves (bathe your whole body). But if you are ill or on a journey, or any of you comes after answering the call of nature, or you have been in contact with women (i.e. sexual intercourse), and you find no water, then perform Tayammum with clean earth and rub therewith your faces and hands” [al-Maa’idah 5:6]
So Allah has enjoined upon us both minor and major purification, and tayammum could take the place of either of them. This was stated by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah in Majmoo’ al-Fatawa (21/396). Minor purification is wudu and major purification is ghusl. 
2 – al-Bukhaari narrated in two places (344 and 348) from ‘Imraan ibn Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw a man keeping away and not praying with the people. He said, “O So and so, what kept you from praying with the people?” He said, “O Messenger of Allah, I became junub and there is no water.” He said, “You should use clean earth, for it will suffice you.” According to another report the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) found water and gave a vessel of water to the one who had become junub, and said, “Go and pour this over yourself.” 
This indicates that tayammum is a means of purification and suffices instead of water, but if water is available then it must be used. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told him to pour it on himself even though no new janaabah had occurred. This was stated by Ibn ‘Uthaymeen in Majmoo’ al-Fatawa, 11/239. 
3 – Muslim (368) narrated that a man came to ‘Umar and said: “I have become junub and I cannot find any water.” He said: “Do not pray.” ‘Ammaar said: “Do you not remember, O Ameer al-Mu’mineen, when you and I were on a campaign and we become junub, and we could not find any water? You did not pray, but I rolled in the dust and prayed, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ‘It would have been sufficient if you had struck the ground with your hands then wiped your face and hands with them.’” ‘Umar said: “Fear Allah, O ‘Ammaar!” He said, “If you wish I will not narrate it.” ‘Umar said: “We accept what you say.” According to another report, ‘Ammaar said: “O Ameer al-Mu’mineen, if you wish, because of your position, I will not tell it to anyone.” 
‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) had forgotten that event. 
“ ‘Umar said: ‘Fear Allah, O ‘Ammaar!’” – What this means is that ‘Umar said to ‘Ammaar: Fear Allah with regard to what you are narrating, for perhaps you have forgotten or become confused. With regard to ‘Ammaar saying, “If you wish I will not narrate it,” what this means – and Allah knows best – is: If you think it is better for me to refrain from narrating it than to narrate it, then I will refrain, because it is obligatory for me to obey you so long as that does not involve sin. The basic principle with regard to conveying knowledge had already been fulfilled, and if he had withheld this  hadeeth after that, he would not have come under the heading of those who withhold knowledge. It may be that he meant, ‘I will not broadcast it so that it becomes well known among people, rather I will only narrate it rarely.’ This was stated by al-Nawawi. 
“ ‘Umar said “We accept what you say” – i.e., the fact that I do not remember it does not means that it is not true, and I have no right to stop you narrating it. This was stated by al-Haafiz in Fath al-Baari. 
4 – Abu Dawood (334) narrated that ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas said: I had a wet dream on a cold night during the campaign of Dhaat al-Salaasil, and I was afraid that I would die if I did ghusl, so I did tayammum then I led my companions in praying Fajr. They mentioned that to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and he said: “O ‘Amr, you led your companions in prayer when you were junub?” So I told him what had kept me from doing ghusl. I said: “I heard that Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘And do not kill yourselves (nor kill one another). Surely, Allah is Most Merciful to you’ [al-Nisa’ 4:29]. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) smiled and did not say anything. 
Al-Haafiz said in al-Fath (1/589): its isnaad is qawiy (strong). It was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
Al-Bukhaari (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Saheeh: “If a person who is junub fears that he may become ill or die or fears thirst then he should do tayammum,” and he mentioned that ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas became junub on a cold night so he did tayammum, and recited (the verse) (interpretation of the meaning): ‘And do not kill yourselves (nor kill one another). Surely, Allah is Most Merciful to you’ [al-Nisa’ 4:29]. He mentioned that to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and he did not rebuke him. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in Majmoo’ al-Fatawa (21/451): 
Whoever becomes junub whether as the result of a wet dream or intercourse – permissible or forbidden – has to do ghusl and pray. If he is unable to do ghusl because there is no water or because he will be harmed by using it – such as if he is sick and using water will make his sickness worse, or there is a cold wind and he fears that if he does ghusl he will become sick with a headache or cold or bronchitis – then he should do tayammum and pray. This applies equally to men and women. He (or she) does not have the right to delay the prayer beyond its prescribed time.” 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz was asked in Majmoo’ al-Fatawa (10/201): 
Does tayammum mean that the junub person no longer has to do ghusl at all? How many prayers may he offer with tayammum? 
He replied: 
Tayammum takes the place of water, as Allah has made the earth a place of worship and a means of purification for the Muslims. If no water is available or the person is unable to use it because of sickness, then tayammum takes its place and remains sufficient until he finds water. When he finds water he has to do ghusl to cleanse himself of the previous janaabah. Similarly if the sick person recovers and Allah heals him, he has to do ghusl to cleanse himself from the previous janaabah from which he had purified himself by means of tayammum, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Clean earth is the wudu of the Muslim if he cannot find water for ten years.” Then he said: “When you find water, then make it touch your skin.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi from the hadeeth of Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him); narrated by al-Bazzaar and classed as saheeh by Ibn al-Qattaan, from the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah may Allah be pleased with him. 
If the junub person finds water then he should make it touch his skin, i.e. wash with it. With regard to his past prayers, they are valid by virtue of the tayammum he did when water was not available or he was unable to use it, because of sickness that prevented him from using it, until the sickness ends and he recovers and until he finds water, if none was available, even if that takes a long time.",Islam Q&A
40210,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/40210,There is no zakah on precious stones unless they are for trade,"What is the rate of zakah that must be paid on precious stones such as diamonds, as they are not gold?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The majority of scholars are of the view that no zakah is due on precious stones unless they are for trade. In their opinion, zakah is only due on gold and silver. 
Imam Malik said in al-Mudawwanah (1/431): 
No zakah is due on gems, pearls or amber. 
Al-Shaafa’i said in al-Umm: 
No zakah is due on the things that women wear for adornment, or that are kept by men and women, such as pearls, chrysolite, sapphires, rubies, precious stones extracted from the sea, etc. zakah is only due on gold and silver. 
Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmoo’: 
Apart from gold and silver, no zakah is due on gems such as sapphires, turquoise, pearls, rubies, emeralds, chrysolite, iron, brass, copper and glass, no matter how beautifully they are made or how high their value. No zakah is due on musk and amber either. 
There is no dispute regarding any of these things in our view. This is the view of the majority of scholars of the salaf and others. Ibn al-Mundhir and others narrated that al-Hasan al-Basri, ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez, al-Zuhri, Ibn Yoosuf and Ishaaq ibn Raahawayh said that the khums must be paid on amber. Al-Zuhri said: The same applies to pearls. Our companions narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn al-Hasan al-Anbari said: The khums must be paid on everything that is extracted from the sea, apart from fish. Al-‘Anbari and others narrated two reports from Ahmad, one of which is like the view of the majority, and the other says that he said that zakah must be paid on everything that we have mentioned, if its value reaches the nisaab – even musk and fish. Our evidence is as follows: 
1-The basic principle that no zakah is due except in cases where there is shar’i evidence
2-It was narrated in a saheeh report that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: No zakah is due on amber, rather it is something that the sea has thrown up
What we have mentioned is the conclusion based on the evidence concerning this matter. With regard to the hadeeth narrated from ‘Amr ibn Shu’ayb, from his father, from his grandfather, that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “there is no zakah on stones,” this is very weak (da’eef jiddan). It was narrated by al-Bayhaqi who stated that it is weak. 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz was asked (14/121): 
Nowadays there are many types of jewellery such as diamonds, platinum etc which are made for wearing etc. Is any zakah due on them? What if they are made into vases and vessels for decoration or for use? Please advise us, may Allah reward you. 
He replied: 
If the jewellery is made of gold or silver, then zakah is due on it, if it reaches the nisaab and one full hijri year has passed, whether it is for wearing or for lending, according to the more sound of the two scholarly opinions, because of the saheeh ahaadeeth which have been narrated concerning that. If they are not made of gold and silver – such as diamonds, carnelians, etc – then no zakah is due on them, unless they are intended for trade, in which case they come under the general heading of trade goods, so zakah must be paid on them as in the case of all other trade goods. It is not permissible to use vessels of gold and silver even if they are only for adornment, because using them for adornment may lead to using them for eating and drinking. It was narrated in a saheeh hadeeth that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not drink from vessels of gold and silver and do not eat from plates of gold and silver; they are for them – meaning the kuffaar – in this world and for you in the Hereafter.” Saheeh – agreed upon. 
The one who has acquired such things has to pay zakah on them and also repent to Allah. He also has to change them into something that does not look like vessels, such as jewellery etc. 
He also said (14/124): 
Jewels that are not gold, such as diamonds, are not subject to zakah, unless they are intended for trade. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: 
What is the ruling on keeping jewels such as diamonds? Is zakah due on them? Is the ruling on diamonds the same as the ruling on gold and silver? 
He replied: 
Keeping jewels to use them is permissible subject to the condition that that does not reach the level of extravagance. If it reaches the level of extravagance it is not allowed, based on the general principle that forbids extravagance, which oversteps the limit set by Allah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and waste not by extravagance. Verily, He likes not Al-Musrifoon (those who waste by extravagance)”
[al-An’aam 6:141]
If keeping these jewels such as diamonds etc does not reach the level of extravagance, then it is permitted, because of the general meaning of the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“He it is Who created for you all that is on earth”
[al-Baqarah 2:29]
No zakah is due on them unless they are prepared for trade, in which case they come under the same ruling as all other trade goods.

    It was proven in Saheeh al-Bukhaari from ‘Aa’ishah 
    (may Allaah be pleased with her) that some people came to the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: “Some people bring us 
    meat and we do not know whether they mentioned the name of Allaah over it or 
    not.” He said: “Say the name of Allaah yourselves then eat.” I said: They 
    (the people who brought the meat) were new in Islam and they were not sure 
    whether they said the name of Allaah (when slaughtering the meat) or not. So 
    he said: Say the name of Allaah yourself and eat. So it is permissible to 
    eat even if we do not know whether the name of Allaah has been pronounced 
    over the meat or not. Similarly it is permissible to eat even if we do not 
    know whether it was slaughtered in the proper manner or not, because if the 
    action was done by the appropriate people, the basic principle is that it is 
    valid unless there is evidence to the contrary. If there comes to us meat 
    that has been slaughtered by a Muslim, a Jew or a Christian, then we do not 
    ask about it and we do not say, “How was it slaughtered?” or “Was the name 
    of Allaah mentioned over it or not?” It is halaal so long as there is no 
    proof that it is haraam. This is a way in which Allaah has made things easy 
    for us. Otherwise we would have a problem every time some meat was offered 
    to us, and we would have to ask, “Who slaughtered it? Does he pray or not? 
    Did he say the name of Allaah over it or not? Did the blood flow or not?” 
    and so on. But by the grace of Allaah, if an action is done by the 
    appropriate people, then the basic principle is that it is sound and valid 
    unless there is evidence to the contrary.","See As’ilat al-Baab il-Maftooh, vol. 1, p. 77, by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him)"

40223,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/40223,The pilgrim doing qiraan only has to do saa’i once,"A question about pilgrimage to the sacred House of Allaah. With regard to qiraan Hajj, can we enter ihraam for Hajj and ‘Umrah together, on the basis that the saa’i done between al-Safa and al-Marwah (after the tawaaf of arrival) is the saa’i which we intended to do after tawaaf al-ifaadah? I.e., that we do not have to do saa’i after tawaaf al-ifaadah so long as we did saa’i after the tawaaf of arrival?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The pilgrim doing qiraan is the one who enters ihraam for ‘Umrah and Hajj together. It is better to do saa’i after the tawaaf of arrival, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did, but he may delay it and do it with tawaaf al-ifaadah. 
There is evidence that the pilgrim doing qiraan only has to do one saa’i, for example: 
1 – The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did qiraan, and he only did one saa’i between al-Safa and al-Marwah, after the tawaaf of arrival. 
Muslim (1215) narrated that Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his companions only did saa’i once between al-Safa and al-Marwah, after the first tawaaf. 
Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
“The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his companions only did saa’i once” means that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and those of his companions who were with him did qiraan, which means doing saa’i between al-Safa and al-Marwah once.  Those of his companions who were doing tamattu’ did saa’i twice, once for ‘Umrah and then again for Hajj on the Day of Sacrifice. This hadeeth is clear support for al-Shaafa’i and those who agreed with him that the pilgrim doing qiraan only has to do one tawaaf, i.e., tawaaf al-ifaadah, and one saa’i. 
2 – al-Bukhaari (1556) and Muslim (1211) narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: Those who had entered ihraam for ‘Umrah (i.e., those who were doing tamattu’) circumambulated the House and did saa’i between al-Safa and al-Marwah, then they exited ihraam, then they did another tawaaf after they came back from Mina. But those who were combining Hajj and ‘Umrah (i.e., those who were doing qiraan) did only one saa’i. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was asked: is one tawaaf and one saa’i sufficient for the pilgrim doing qiraan?  
He replied: 
If a person does qiraan Hajj, then the tawaaf of Hajj and the saa’i of Hajj are sufficient for both Hajj and ‘Umrah. The tawaaf of arrival (tawaaf al-qudoom) is Sunnah, and if he wants he may do saa’i after the tawaaf of arrival as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did, or if he wants he may delay it until the day of Eid, after tawaaf al-ifaadah. But it is better to do it sooner because that is what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did. When the day of Eid comes, he should do tawaaf al-ifaadah only, and not saa’i, because he has already done saa’i. The evidence that one tawaaf and one saa’i is sufficient for both Hajj and ‘Umrah is the words of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) when she was doing qiraan Hajj: “Your tawaaf around the House and (your saa’i) between al-Safa and al-Marwah is enough for your Hajj and ‘Umrah.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 1897’ classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 1984. Thus the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) explained that one tawaaf and one saa’i in the case of qiraan is sufficient for both Hajj and ‘Umrah. Fataawa Arkaan al-Islam, p. 563.

If removing this tooth will result in damage to the remaining teeth, what is the ruling?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: It should be 
    noted that it is not permissible to have a gold tooth unless there is a need 
    for that. It is not permissible for anyone to have a gold tooth made for 
    adornment except for women; if it is their custom to adorn themselves by 
    covering their teeth with gold then there is nothing wrong with that. But in 
    the case of men that is not permissible, unless there is a need for that.

     Secondly: If a person who has gold teeth dies, then if it is

If the heir is an adult

Is it permissible for me to marry her?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is permissible for you to marry the daughter of your maternal aunt in this situation, because breastfeeding (radaa’ah) only makes the woman (and her daughters) the mahrams of the child who nursed if it takes place five times. [A mahram is a relative whom one is forbidden to marry and with whom the rulings of hijab or covering do not apply - Translator]. The evidence for that is the hadeeth narrated by Muslim (1452) from ‘Aa’ishah who said: “One of the (rulings) that was revealed in the Quran was that ten known breastfeedings make the child a mahram, then that was abrogated and replaced with five.”    
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
The scholars differed concerning the number of breastfeedings for which the ruling on breastfeeding (radaa’ah) applies. ‘Aa’ishah and al-Shaafa’i and his companions said that there is no proof for any number less than five. The majority of scholars said that the ruling applies if breastfeeding occurs once. This was narrated by Ibn al-Mundhir from ‘Ali, Ibn Mas’ood, Ibn ‘Umar, Ibn ‘Abbaas, ‘Ata’, Tawoos, Ibn al-Musayyib, al-Hasan, Makhool, al-Zuhri, Qataadah, Hammaad, Maalik, al-Awzaa’i, al-Thawri and Abu Haneefah – may Allah be pleased with them. Abu Thawr, Abu ‘Ubayd, Ibn al-Mundhir and Dawood said: The ruling applies in the case of three breastfeedings, not less than that. Al-Shaafa’i and those who agreed with him followed the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah which mentioned five known breastfeedings. 
For the definition of breastfeeding which makes the child a mahram, see question no. 804. 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz was asked whether breastfeeding from a woman three times makes her a mahram. 
He replied: this breastfeeding three times does not make her a mahram through breastfeeding. The ruling on becoming a mahram through breastfeeding only applies if breastfeeding occurs five times or more. Then he quoted the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah as evidence. 
Fatawa Islamiyyah, 3/326. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: 
One breastfeeding does not have any effect, rather it must be five breastfeedings that occur before the child is weaned and before he reaches the age of two. A person does not become the woman’s (foster) child if he breastfeeds once or twice or three or four times. It must also be five known breastfeedings; if there is some uncertainty as to whether he breastfed four or five times, the principle is that it was four, because every time we are uncertain about numbers, we take the lower number. Based on this, if a woman says, I breastfed this child but I do not know if it was once or twice, or three or four or five times, we say that this child is not her (foster) child, because it has to be five known breastfeedings without a doubt.

It was to be paid before the exam and whoever was not able to pay that money could have had the amount reduced and if he was not able to pay at all, he could have been let off, so he could still have the same advantage as the other students had who did pay. Is what he did correct? Please give a detailed reply, quoting evidence.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The teacher 
    does not have the right to take anything from the students, even if that 
    this for the purpose of renovating the classroom, because that is not the 
    responsibility of the students; rather it is the responsibility of the 
    school. This money in many ways is similar to the haraam maks (customs levy 
    or purchase tax) – see question no.

    concerning the prohibition of the maks. 
Marks for 
    participation are only given to students for their efforts and hard work in 
    their studies, not for giving money to the teacher! The same applies to 
    grades in the test, they should be based on what the student has written on 
    his test paper, and have nothing to do with renovation or adornment of the 
    classroom. 
If the 
    teacher gives marks to students in return for them giving him money, this 
    goes against the education system and is also wronging people with regard to 
    their wealth, and exposing the poorer students to embarrassment when they 
    have to tell him that they cannot pay all or some of the money. 
The teacher 
    has to fear Allaah and give each student the grades that he deserves 
    according to the education system that is in place. He should not ask the 
    students for money, no matter how little. 
The teacher 
    should encourage the students to donate money for repairs to the classroom, 
    or for any other charitable cause. That comes under the heading of 
    cooperating in righteousness and piety. It also makes the students get used 
    to spending money on charitable causes. But that should have nothing to do 
    with the grades that the students get.

Do I have to do anything?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Making up missed Ramadaan fasts is obligatory, and it is not permissible to break such a fast except in case of necessity. Once a person starts to observe a fast to make up a fast he missed, he is obliged to complete it, and it is not permissible for him to break it except for a legitimate shar’i excuse. 
It was narrated that Umm Haani’ (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: “O Messenger of Allaah, I broke my fast when I was fasting.” He said to her: “Were you making up a missed fast?” She said: “No.” He said: “Then it does not matter if it was a voluntary fast.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, no. 2456; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani. This indicates that it would matter if she broke her fast when observing an obligatory fast. What is meant by “it would matter” is that it would be a sin. 
With regard to what happened in your case, the expiation of intercourse is only required if what is broken is a fast in Ramadaan itself. Based on this, you do not have to do anything except make that day up again, as well as repent to Allaah and resolve not to do such a thing again. 
Ibn Rushd said: The majority are agreed that no expiation is required for deliberately breaking a fast observed to make up a missed Ramadaan fast, because it does not come under the same category with regard to sanctity of time, i.e., Ramadaan. 
Bidaayah al-Mujtahid, 2/80. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about a woman who broke a fast she was observing to make up for a missed Ramadaan fast, to make her guests feel comfortable. He replied: If she was making up a missed obligatory fast, such as making up a day of Ramadaan, then it is not permissible for anyone to break such a fast except in cases of necessity. With regard to breaking the fast because of the arrival of guests, this is haraam and is not permitted, because the basic principle in sharee’ah is that “Everyone who starts an obligatory duty is required to complete it, unless he has a legitimate shar’i excuse.”  But if he is making up a voluntary fast then he does not have to complete it, because it is not obligatory. 
Based on this, if a person is observing a naafil (supererogatory) fast and something happens that means he has to break his fast, he may do so. This is what was narrated from the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), that he came to the Mother of the Believers ‘Aa’ishah  (may Allaah be pleased with her) and said: “Do you have anything (to eat)?” She said: “We have been given some hays (a kind of meal).” He said: “Show it to me, for I started fasting this morning.” And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) ate some of it. This has to do with a naafil fast, not one which is obligatory.

    those who are entitled to it. It is not permissible for anyone to transgress 
    against it or to take anything from it that he is not entitled to. If we 
    assume that there is someone who does steal from it and transgress against 
    it, it is not permissible for us to join him in that grave sin. If it were 
    permissible to plunder and steal the wealth of the state on the grounds that 
    one is taking from the bayt al-maal, there would be a great deal of evil, 
    corruption, aggression and wrongdoing, and all of them would be guilty of

    If a man marries a woman, then simply by virtue of the 
    marriage contract she becomes permanently forbidden in marriage to his 
    father, even if the marriage was not consummated, whether he dies or he 
    divorces her. 

    Allaah says, when mentioning the women who are forbidden in 
    marriage (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “the wives of your sons who (spring) from your own loins”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:23]

    Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni (9/524): 
When a man has concluded 
    the marriage contract with a woman, she becomes forbidden in marriage to his 
    father simply by virtue of the marriage contract, because Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “the wives of your sons who (spring) from your own loins”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:23]
This refers to the wives 
    of his sons. And there is no scholarly difference of opinion on this point, 
    praise be to Allaah. 

    Ibn al-‘Arabi said in Ahkaam al-Qur’aan: 

    Every woman who becomes permissible (through marriage) to the 
    son becomes forbidden to the father permanently. 

    Imam al-Shaafa’i said in al-Umm: 

    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “the wives of your sons who (spring) from your own loins”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:23]

    So any woman whom a man marries becomes forbidden to his 
    father, whether the son consummated the marriage with her or not. Similarly 
    she becomes forbidden for his grandfathers on both his father’s and mother’s 
    sides. 

    The Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas was asked: Is it 
    permissible for a father to marry the woman whom his son divorced, if he did 
    not consummate the marriage with her? 

    They replied: 

    If the son concluded a marriage contract with a woman, then 
    she becomes permanently forbidden to his father and grandfather, including 
    fathers and grandfathers through both descent and breastfeeding (radaa’ah), 
    even if he did not consummate the marriage with her and was not alone with 
    her. This is indicated by the general meaning of the verse in which Allaah 
    mentions the women to whom marriage is forbidden (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “the wives of your sons who (spring) from your own loins”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:23]

    The Standing Committee was also asked (18/210): 

    What is your opinion concerning a man who married a woman 
    then divorced her, and her ‘iddah ended – is this women permissible in 
    marriage for the man’s maternal grandfather or is she forbidden to him? If 
    she is forbidden, what is the evidence for that, may Allaah reward you? 

    They replied: 

    It is not permissible for a man to marry a woman with whom 
    his son or his son’s son or daughter’s son, whether through descent or 
    breastfeeding, has concluded a marriage contract. That is because Allaah 
    says, when mentioning the women who are forbidden in marriage 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “the wives of your sons who (spring) from your own loins”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:23]

    So if a man divorces his wife or dies, she is not permissible 
    for his father or his grandfather, whether on his father’s or mother’s side, because this ruling applies equally to both paternal and maternal grandfathers, as the verse is general in meaning. 

    And Allaah knows best.",Islam Q&A
40263,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/40263,Ruling on “Business” and other scams,"A few months ago there appeared a company called “Business” which does a kind of marketing. Its idea may be summed up as follows: a person buys the company’s products – which consists of programs (software), a web site and e-mail – for 99 dollars, and after buying he is given the opportunity to market its products to others in return for a set commission.  

Then this person convinces two others to join the program, meaning that they both buy the company’s products, then they will also have the right to attract other marketers in return for commission. 

Then each of these also convinces two more people to join, and so on. In this way there will be a network of followers who join the program, like a pyramid. 

With regard to the way in which the commission is calculated, the company stipulates that the number of individuals who are attracted through the purchaser (participant) and those under him in the pyramid should be no less than 9 in order to earn the commission. But this is on the condition that the number of members under each of the first two cannot be less than two, and the commission will be $55. The commission is paid for each 9 persons, and each nine persons in the pyramid scheme is called a level. 

Because the pyramid may increase in size each time a new level is added to it, this commission increases greatly every time. 

So if we assume that the pyramid grows each month, i.e. that each month two people join each person in the pyramid (as is assumed by the company, according to its website), this means that the commission that the member gets will be more than $25,000 in twelve months, and it will keep growing every month. 

This is what is so tempting about these schemes. For a small amount of money, no more than $100, the participant can get hundreds or thousands times that amount. 

Hence these companies market these schemes with promises of great riches within a short period of time, by developing and increasing the size of the pyramid. 

My question: What is the ruling on this operation, especially since it is so widespread and there are so many different opinions on it?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.When discussing these operations which spread quickly and which are very unclear 
    and ambiguous to ordinary people, as well as being very tempting, we must note two points: 
1 – The shar’i ruling that is based on the texts and principles of sharee’ah, as 
    well as on a clear understanding of this issue as it is, what it leads to, and what its background is. 
2 – We must train ourselves to follow the shar’i ruling and not be deceived by 
    specious arguments. 
Since this matter requires lengthy discussion, we will give a brief answer, 
    followed by a discussion of the relevant shar’i principles, then we will answer in more detail. 
Brief answer to this question:
Based on the way that this “Business” operation is carried out and what it really 
    is, and what the representatives of this company have mentioned of information and conditions, and the evidence and conditions quoted by those who 
    have discussed it to justify either allowing or disallowing it, and by measuring all of that against the Qur’aan and Sunnah and the shar’i 
    principles concerning transactions, and the views of the scholars, it is clear that this operation is haraam, for a number of reasons, including 
    the following: 
1 – This operation is based on gambling and consuming people’s wealth unlawfully. 
    It involves deceit and tempting people to earn a lot of money. It exploits their love of accumulating wealth. Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 
“O you who believe! Intoxicants (all kinds of alcoholic drinks), and gambling, 
    and Al-Ansaab (stone altars for sacrifices to idols, jinn etc), and Al-Azlaam (arrows for seeking luck or decision) are an abomination of 
    Shaytaan’s (Satan’s) handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) in order that you may be successful”
[al-Maa’idah 5:90] 
“And eat up not one another’s property unjustly (in any illegal way, e.g. 
    stealing, robbing, deceiving)”
[al-Baqarah 2:188]
And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Your blood 
    and your wealth are sacred to you as this day of yours in this land of yours in this month of yours is sacred.” Narrated by Muslim, 2137. This 
    analogy in the hadeeth serves to make this prohibition very emphatic indeed. 
2 – After a thorough examination of this issue, it is clear that introducing the 
    product – which is software programs, a web site and e-mail – does not change the ruling on this operation, because it is obvious that the product 
    is not what most of those who rush to buy actually want, as is proven from the evidence mentioned in the detailed answer. Introducing this product 
    in this manner makes it even more haraam, because it involves trickery that leads to a haraam transaction which is a kind of gambling. 
3 – This operation is unlike the kind of commission that is permitted, in several 
    ways:  one has to pay money in order to enter the scheme, unlike the commission that requires no such condition. The purpose is not to sell the 
    product to those who need it, rather the purpose is to build an incentive system. Even if we accept that this is commission, it is still haraam 
    because it involves cheating the purchaser and raising false hopes and being insincere towards him. Based on this, the view of those who permit it 
    on the grounds that it is commission is not correct.  Perhaps the reason for that is that this matter has not been described to them as it really 
    is, or the one who issued this ruling did not understand it properly. This ruling is applicable to many kinds of dealings and transactions that 
    occur nowadays in the marketing field.  
Those who wish to learn more will find detailed discussion of these points in the 
    detailed answer and in the discussion of basic principles given below. 
Detailed Answer:
Before giving a detailed answer to this question, and in order to train ourselves 
    to accept the rulings of sharee’ah, we should start by noting some of the basic principles of sharee’ah etc which will help the Muslim – who 
    submits to the rulings of Allaah – to deal with this operation and similar schemes devised by business-minded people, in a confident manner, 
    especially when the following five main factors are present in these operations: 
1-Widespread media and advertising media
2-Ease of financial transfer by means of credit cards and the like
3-Increased need for money among ordinary people, because of excessive desire to accumulate 
    non-essentials
4-Greed and love of money in human nature
5-Lack of religious commitment and desire to seek halaal provision among many Muslims
There follow a number of principles that will help us to deal with this kind of 
    operation and similar types which are bound to appear in the future, so we should pay attention to these details: 
1 – The fitnah (temptation) of money is one of the greatest fitnahs that can 
    affect man’s religious commitment and the blessing of what he already has of wealth and children. So we must beware of that and seek to ensure 
    that the sources of our wealth are permissible. 
2 – Avoiding doubtful issues is a principle that is well known in Islam, even if 
    one is not quite certain that the doubtful matter is in fact haraam. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “What it 
    halaal is clear and what is haraam is clear, and between them lie doubtful matters which many people do not know about. Whoever is avoids the 
    doubtful matters has protected his religious commitment and his honour, but whoever falls into doubtful matters will fall into that which is 
    haraam.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 52; Muslim, 1599. 
3 – “If any of this money comes to you without you asking for it or hoping for it, 
    then take it, but do not think about it or hope for it.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 138, in a marfoo’ report. This means: do not let yourself dwell 
    on thoughts of money that you do not have, or let that make you feel sad if you do not get it. The prohibition on thinking about it mentioned in 
    this hadeeth refers to being given a gift of something that is permissible – so how about if you dwell on thoughts of dubious wealth, or wealth 
    that is haraam? This will inevitably lead to more negative effects and should be shunned even more. 
4 – “Whoever gives up something for the sake of Allaah, Allaah will compensate him 
    with something better than it.” Narrated by Ahmad and  classed as saheeh by al-Albaani. This includes both the one who gives up something haraam 
    and the one who gives up something concerning which there is doubt.  
5 – Blessing in wealth, even if it is little, is better than seeking to increase 
    wealth in haraam or dubious ways. 
6 – The Muslim should strive to be completely honest with himself in recognizing 
    his motive in joining such schemes. Is he hoping to get money and needs the product as a means to reduce guilt and ward off blame, or is the 
    product itself what he basically wants? He should note that whatever he conceals of his intentions is known to Allaah who knows what is secret and 
    what is yet more hidden, and He will ask him about that and bring him to account. 
7 – The ruling on a matter is based on the way in which it is understood. Withholding some 
    information from the mufti does not allow you to follow his fatwa, and that does not excuse the one who follows it from blame, so long as he knows 
    that the mufti does not have the full picture. 
8 – “Righteousness is that with which the heart feels at ease, and sin is that 
    which you feel uneasy about, even if the people give you fatwa after fatwa.” Narrated by Ahmad, 17320. Al-Albaani said in Saheeh al-Targheeb, 
    1734, it is hasan li ghayrihi. 
9 – If the one who consumes haraam wealth acknowledges that he is doing something 
    haraam, this is less serious than one who consumes it by means of deceit and trickery, because the latter has added another sin to his consumption 
    of haraam wealth, which is his trying to deceive Allaah. Ibn al-Qayyim said: 
“Changing the definition and name of things that are haraam when their essence remains the 
    same is even more evil, as well as involving an attempt to deceive Allaah and His Messenger, and claiming that Islam accepts trickery, deception, 
    cheating and hypocrisy, and that sharee’ah forbids something because it is evil but then allows it when it becomes even worse. Hence Ayyoob 
    al-Sakhtiyaani said that some people try to cheat Allaah like they cheat children. If they were to commit the sin believing that it is a sin that 
    would be less serious.” 
Ighaathat al-Lahfaan, 1/354. 
10 – If it is proven to a person that a thing is haraam, then he must stop 
    thinking about it and should feel no regret for not having it when he sees that others have it. He should praise Allaah for having saved him and 
    ask Him to make him hate haraam things no matter how great they are, and help him always to avoid them, and help him to strive against his nafs 
    (self) to stop thinking about it. 
11 – The rulings of sharee’ah are based on complete knowledge and wisdom. It pays 
    attention to the common interest even if that involves something that he thinks may be detrimental to his own personal interests. So the Muslim 
    should not think only of his own personal gains and overlook the aims of sharee’ah which seeks the common interest. 
With regard to the detailed answer, it may be summed up in the following three points: 
Firstly: The way this operation is done is very similar to so called pyramid 
    schemes or multi-level marketing (MLM), even though it may not be exactly the same in all aspects. Pyramid schemes are based on an incentive 
    system, and those who invented them in the west looked only at earning money, with no attention to the question of whether the source is 
    permissible or not. If we assess this system in the light of the texts and principles of sharee’ah, it will become clear that it is haraam from a 
    number of angles, such as: 
(i)It is based on consuming people’s wealth unlawfully, because this pyramid will inevitably have a 
    final level, and these people will definitely lose out to the interests of the higher levels. The pyramid can only grow when there are people who 
    will lose out to the interests of the higher levels which will collect insanely high commissions. In the last two levels of every branch there 
    will be two levels, the first of which is lying and giving false hope to the next level of making a profit, and the last level which will be 
    fooled and cheated, because it will buy but will never find someone to sell to. We have already mentioned above the verses and hadeeth which 
    sternly forbid consuming people’s wealth unlawfully.
(ii)It is based on gambling, which means that a person pays money in return for which he may get more 
    money than he paid, or he may lose his money. This is what happens to those who join such schemes. This is one of the most important and clearest 
    reasons for it being haraam.
(iii)Because pyramid schemes involve a lot of cheating and deception, they have been banned and outlawed 
    by many kaafir western systems – if they appear in a form where there is no product for sale – even though those systems allow riba and gambling 
    in principle – and their experts have warned against them. (See the following website and its many links:
    http://skepdic.com/pyramid.html)
Based on the above, the “Business” operation mentioned in the 
    question is haraam for many reasons, because it resembles pyramid schemes in the main reason why it is haraam, which is th1at it is a form of 
    gambling and consuming people’s wealth unlawfully. 
Secondly: Including a product in such a program does not make 
    it permissible or remove the reasons why it is haraam, rather it makes it even more emphatically haraam, because this is a kind of trickery aimed 
    at making this operation acceptable and giving the impression that the product is the main objective. But “Changing the definition and name of 
    things that are haraam when their essence remains the same is even more evil, as well as involving an attempt to deceive Allaah and His 
    Messenger.” Ighaathat al-Lahfaan, 1/354 
It seems that the product has no effect of rendering the 
    operation permissible for the following reasons: 
(i)The most important motive for participants is the marketing, not the product, based on the fact that 
    these kinds of programs and services existed many years before this company appeared and still exist, for a lower price! What is making so many 
    people rush towards these schemes, and this particular company, apart from the hopes of the income generated by joining this scheme?
(ii)The suggestion that the products are useful and easy to operate and have distinct features that make 
    it worth paying one hundred dollars for them is a flawed argument, because this program has no copyright preventing individuals making use of the 
    site through the one who has already joined, without the new user paying anything. Indeed if one individual subscribes, dozens could use it and 
    benefit from all the services offered on the site. It only has copyright protecting other companies from using it. What motive is there to spend 
    money on it except to be part of this pyramid scheme which is in effect gambling?
(iii)There is an essential condition for joining this pyramid scheme, which is that one buys the product 
    for more than the price of similar products in order to obtain more commission and to use the company’s website for advertising and marketing. 
    Temptation leads people to pay the exorbitant price in the hope of recouping it and making more by means of the marketing which is the primary 
    purpose for joining. This is the essence of gambling which is forbidden in sharee’ah.
(iv)The mention of tempting commission in return for marketing is what motivates people to buy and join 
    the scheme, because usually they do not buy unless this commission is mentioned, and because some may even agree to buy without checking on the 
    products they are buying, or without needing them in the first place. The fact that many people do not benefit from most of the programs confirms 
    this further; in fact some of them do not even use the programs at all.
(v)The amount required to join - $99 – is equivalent to a month’s salary or more in some countries, so 
    ordinary people would not pay such an amount and join this scheme, unless there is the hope of making a lot of money. Yet despite that many people 
    join and even take out loans for that purpose.
(vi)When those who join for the sake of the product find out the company states that three-quarters of 
    what they paid is spent on marketing instead of using advertising agencies, this motivates them to take part in marketing in order to recoup what 
    they have paid in excess of the product’s value. So they get involved in the marketing process, then they get carried away and do not stop at 
    making up what they have lost, rather they keep going.
(vii)Some enthusiasts buy the company’s product more than once and some, as they have themselves admitted, 
    buy it one hundred times! Even though they know that buying it once guarantees that the purchaser will benefit from all the company’s programs at 
    any time. No one would doubt that this is a form of gambling, and clearly indicates that the aim of this operation is gambling.
(viii)The company obliges purchasers to continue marketing and earning high commissions by renewing their 
    subscriptions annually for the same amount, on the basis that they are going to add new services. But these new services – even if they are real – 
    still add up to buying something unknown for a set price, because the new services may be small, or they may contain new programs that the 
    subscriber has no need of. So this purchase is haraam because it involves deceit and ambiguity, as one of the parties has no idea what he is 
    buying.
(ix)The individual should check himself and understand his intentions in joining this program. That will 
    enable him to understand that the aim is to make him join a pyramid scheme, especially when he can get whatever he needs of these programs and 
    services for free or for much less on other sites, as well as having the option of not buying things he does not need.
Thirdly: This operation does not come under the heading of brokerage that is 
    permissible, because it is different from it in several essential ways. Those muftis who stated that it is a kind of brokerage only answered 
    questions in which no details were mentioned that would give a proper picture of the issue, thus these fatwas do not reflect reality. One of the 
    conditions for a ruling to be valid is that it must be based on proper understanding of the issue. Based on this, it is not permissible to follow 
    one whose ruling is known to be based on an imperfect understanding of the issue. 
The differences between this operation and permissible brokerage include the 
    following: 
(i)Brokerage refers to when a middleman points out a product or some benefits that are sought in and of 
    themselves, where ultimately the one who acquires the product will benefit from it. The marketing offered by this company is simply opportunities 
    for marketing to people who will sell it to others, and it will ultimately reach a person or persons who will not get what they hoped for from the 
    transaction.
(ii)In brokerage there is no condition which requires the broker to pay any money because it is not in 
    the interests of the owner of the product to discourage the broker by imposing the condition that he pay him or buy from him. But in the case of 
    this marketing, the one who wants to be a part of it is obliged to pay a sum of money, included in the price of the program, in order to join it 
    or benefit from it, so that he can become a marketing agent. Then he has to renew the payment annually in order to continue marketing.
(iii)The broker is keen to look for more people who need the product, whereas the marketing agent looks 
    for those who are most able to market the program, regardless of whether they need it or not.
(iv)The broker has nothing to do with what the purchasers do with the product, whereas the marketing 
    agent in these schemes needs to market the product continually, so that he can complete the numbers required in order to earn his commission.
(v)In the case of brokerage, the broker earns according to how much he sells, but in this scheme two 
    people may have a share in the number of people to whom the product is marketed, directly or indirectly, but there may be a huge difference in the 
    commission they earn because of the conditions that they stipulate as to how commission is earned. This confirms the fact that the main aim is 
    multi-level marketing, not promotion of the product.
These five differences between the two operations demonstrate the essential 
    differences between them, which means that the “Business” scheme cannot be regarded as permissible when compared with brokerage, especially since 
    there are many factors in the “Business” program which render it haraam, as stated above. 
(vi)If we assume that it is a kind of brokerage – which is not correct – then it is still haraam because 
    this marketing agent cannot state to the one to whom he presents this product that there is a similar product offered by other companies for 
    one-quarter or one-half of their price, or that he may not need some of what is on offer, let alone the fact that he could benefit from the 
    program by going to the company’s site and using the marketing agent’s password, without affecting him or paying him anything. He has to focus on 
    the large commission that he will earn if he buys and markets the product.
(vii)Those who regard it as a kind of brokerage and say that it is permissible stipulate that the 
    marketing thereof should not involve any kind of deceit and should not praise the product for qualities that it does not possess. But these 
    conditions are not usually met by many marketing agents for the reasons mentioned above.
From this detailed answer it should be clear that this and similar programs are 
    haraam. Our advice here to the owners and representatives of these companies is that they should fear Allaah by looking for sources of income that 
    are definitely not haraam or dubious, and that they should fear Allaah with regard to the wealth of their Muslim brothers before there comes a 
    time when there will be no dirham and no dinar, only hasanaat (good deeds) and sayi’aat (bad deeds), and there will be nothing but Paradise or 
    Hell.

40269,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/40269,Husband forcing his wife to abort a pregnancy,"What is the ruling on a husband who tries to make his wife abort against her wishes in the second month of pregnancy because he wants to divorce her, by giving her medicine that will cause that to happen, even though he did not manage to bring about an abortion? Is that halaal or haraam? What is the expiation for doing that?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Aborting a pregnancy is not permissible, whether the soul has been breathed into the embryo or not, but if that is after the soul has been breathed in, the prohibition is more emphatic. 
If a husband tells his wife to abort a pregnancy, it is not permissible for her to obey him. 
Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
Trying to abort a pregnancy is not permissible if it is not proven that the foetus has died; if that is proven then it is permissible. 
Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Ibraaheem, 11/151 
Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan (may Allah preserve him) said: 
Firstly: 
It is not permissible to abort a pregnancy. Once pregnancy is discovered, it must be protected and it is haraam for the mother to harm the pregnancy or disturb it in any way, because it is a trust that Allah has placed in her womb and it has rights, so it is not permissible to mistreat it, harm it or destroy it. 
The shar’i evidence indicates that it is haraam to abort a pregnancy. 
The fact that a baby cannot be born without an operation is no excuse for abortion; many women only give birth by means of an operation (i.e., caesarian), so this is no excuse for aborting the pregnancy. 
Secondly: 
If the soul has been breathed into the foetus and it has started to move, then it is aborted after that and it dies, then (the woman) is regarded as having killed a soul and she is obliged to offer expiation by freeing a slave; if that is not possible, then she must fast for two consecutive months in repentance to Allah. That is if four months of pregnancy have passed, because in that case the soul has been breathed into the foetus. If it is aborted after that, then kafaarah (expiation) as described must be offered. This is a serious matter which cannot be taken lightly. If a woman cannot bear a pregnancy for reasons of sickness, then she has to take medication to prevent getting pregnant in the first place; she may take contraceptive pills to delay getting pregnant for a while, until she regains her health and strength. 
Al-Muntaqa, 5/301-302 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about a man who said to his wife: “Abort what is in your womb and the sin will be on me.” If she does that and listens to him, what expiation will they have to offer? 
He replied: 
If she does that, then they both have to offer expiation by freeing a believing slave; if that is not possible then they have to fast for two consecutive months and they have to give a male or female slave to the heir  that did not take part in the killing, and not to the father, because the father is the one who ordered that he be killed, so he does not deserve anything. 
“A male or female slave” is the diyah (blood money) for the foetus, i.e., the value of a male or female slave, which the scholars stated is equivalent to one-tenth of the diyah for his mother. 
We have already discussed the ruling on abortion in more than one answer. Please see questions no. 13317, 42321, 12733. 
With regard to the expiation for that, because the pregnancy was in the second month or before the soul had been breathed into the foetus, and the abortion did not take place, then no expiation is required. But what is required is repentance to Allah from this haraam action.

I got married – praise be to Allaah – to a man who is good in all ways; he treats me well and I treat him well, our relationship was excellent in all ways, love, respect, harmony and love for one another’s families. But then things started to go wrong. These days my husband and I found out that I was not a virgin, but I am certain that I am innocent because no one ever touched me before him.",,,"Praise be to Allah.If your husband is wise and religiously committed, and he trusts you a great deal, then what he should do is to believe you when you say that you are innocent of any wrongdoing, especially since the breaking of the hymen may be caused by many things, not necessarily by committing the sin of fornication. 
This is if we accept what you have discovered about your not being a virgin. It may be that intercourse has taken place between you but the hymen was not broken, and so there was no bleeding, because of the nature of the hymen. It may be that the hymen is flexible and cannot be broken by intercourse, and requires medical intervention, as is well known to the experts in this field. 
The hymen is simply a physical sign which cannot be considered proof of whether the woman is a virgin or not or whether she has committed an immoral act or not. Hence we find that in court, usually the absence of the hymen is not regarded as grounds for making accusations against the woman, because it may be broken for many reasons. 
So the fact that the hymen is present is not a positive indication that a woman is a virgin, and its absence is not a positive sign of the opposite. 
We advise you to refer to a female doctor to make the matter clear, because there may be many reasons why the hymen is broken. 
We hope that your husband will understand this matter and will not be hasty in judging you. You should be aware that one of the aims of the Shaytaan is to cause division between husbands and wives, because of the great evil that results from that affecting families and individuals, as we see in the hadeeth of Jaabir who said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Iblees placed his throne on water then he sends out his emissaries, and the closest of them to him in status is the one who causes the most fitnah (tribulation). One of them comes and says, ‘I did such and such,’ and he says, ‘You have not done much.’ Then another of them comes and says, ‘I did not leave him alone until I caused division between him and his wife,’ and he draws him close to him and says, ‘How good you are.’” Muslim, 5023. 
So he should close this door to the Shaytaan and avoid thinking about this matter, so long as this matter is not definitive and you are certain that nothing bad happened.  
We ask Allaah to guide him and to reconcile between you.

Should he obey them?,My parents won’t let me shorten my lower garments (so that they do not come down below my ankles). Should I obey them or not?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Allaah has commanded us to honour our parents in many places in His Book, such as 
    when He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And We have enjoined on man to be good and dutiful to his parents; but if they 
    strive to make you join with Me (in worship) anything (as a partner) of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not. Unto Me is your return 
    and I shall tell you what you used to do”
[al-‘Ankaboot 29:8]
The greatest of rights are the rights of Allaah, after which come the rights of 
    created beings, foremost among which are the rights of parents. Hence Allaah mentions His rights and parents’ rights together in many verses of 
    the Holy Qur’aan, such as when He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. And that you be dutiful to your 
    parents. If one of them or both of them attain old age in your life, say not to them a word of disrespect, nor shout at them but address them in 
    terms of honour.”
[al-Isra’ 17:23] 
Obeying parents is obligatory unless they enjoin sin, in which case they should 
    not be obeyed. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no obedience to any created being if it involves 
    disobedience towards the Creator.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4340; Muslim, 1840; Ahmad, 1098. Isbaal or letting the lower garment hang below the 
    ankles is a major sin, so you should not obey them if they tell you to do that. But you can wear your clothes at the longest permissible length so 
    that they do not touch the ankles, then you will not be disobeying your Lord by doing that, and you will not be going against your parents’ 
    wishes, because it is not a condition of shortening the lower garment that it should be at mid-calf length, rather you can obey the rule of 
    sharee’ah by not letting your clothes touch your ankles. 
If they insist that your clothes should be longer than ankle length, then speak to 
    them nicely and try to convince them, but do not disobey Allaah for their sake by letting your clothes hang below the ankles. 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez Aal al-Shaykh was asked: 
What is the ruling on isbaal (letting the clothes hang below the ankles)? Is it 
    permissible to obey my father when he wants me to let my clothes hang below the ankles? 
He replied: 
Isbaal is haraam, indeed it is one of the major sins. The Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever allows his garment to trail along the ground out of pride, Allaah will not look at him on the Day 
    of Resurrection.” And he mentioned the three whom Allaah will not look at on the Day of Resurrection or praise them, and theirs will be a painful 
    torment, among whom is the one who allows his garment to hang below his ankles. The one who does this is disobeying Allaah and transgressing His 
    sacred limits, so he has to repent to Allaah. He will be punished because Allaah will not look at him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will be 
    punished because he is given a warning of Hell fire, which indicates that isbaal is one of the major sins, Moreover there is nothing good in 
    isbaal, because it damages the clothes and may make the person stumble, as ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) said to the young man whom he 
    saw allowing his garment to hang below his ankles – who came to visit ‘Umar in his final sickness – “O young man, lift up your lower garment for 
    it will make your garment last longer and is more obedient to your Lord.” 
With regard to obeying your parents, parents are not to be obeyed if that involves 
    disobeying Allaah. If they tell you to let your garment hang below your ankles, then you should disobey them, because isbaal is a major sin and 
    there is no obedience to any created being if it involves disobedience towards the Creator.

40290,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/40290,Is it correct for the husband’s father to be a witness to his marriage contract?,"I have been married for two years but my marriage was done in the following manner: 
Two years after getting engaged, we decided to do the marriage contract. I went with my father and my fiancée and her father to the registrar’s office, but we found only one notary public. His companion was absent even though he knew that he and his companion were supposed to sign the marriage contract. The notary who was present knows my father. That notary did the marriage contract and asked my wife’s father about the dowry and whether he had received it. He said that he had received it when he had only received half of it, and we went ahead with the marriage contract. When we came out I did not feel comfortable about that so I asked my father whether this marriage contract was Islamically acceptable, since there must be two witnesses and there had only been one. My father replied that there was nothing wrong with that, so I kept quiet, but until now I am not convinced about that. Hence I am asking whether my marriage is Islamically acceptable or is there any reservation concerning it? Can my father be counted as a witness? If it is not Islamically acceptable, what is the solution?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The marriage contract mentioned is valid and your father can be counted as a witness to your marriage. This is the view of Imam al-Shaafa’i and was narrated in one of the reports from Imam Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on them both). 
See Nihaayat al-Muhtaaj, 6/218; al-Insaaf, 8/105 
That is because he is not a wali (guardian) with regard to marriage, so he may be a witness, unlike the wife’s father. 
The view that this is valid was favoured by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him). After mentioning the first view on this matter, which is that it is not permissible for any ascendant (father, grandfather, etc) or descendant (son, grandson, etc) of either spouse to be a witness to the marriage, he said: The second view is that this is valid, and one or both witnesses may be an ascendant or descendent. 
Then he said: So the correct view is that the marriage contract is valid. This was narrated from Ahmad and was the view favoured by many of our companions. 
Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 5/163 
Moreover you mention that you have been married for two years, so it may be assumed that the marriage has been announced publicly, such as inviting people to a wedding party and so on, as is customary among people nowadays. This is sufficient to make the marriage valid, even if it was not witnessed by two witnesses, according to some scholars. This is the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah who said: There is no doubt that a marriage that is announced publicly is valid, even if it is not witnessed by two witnesses. 
Al-Ikhtiyaaraat, p. 210 
The wife’s father erred by saying that he had received the dowry when in fact he had only received half of it, but that does not affect the validity of the marriage contract.

40299,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/40299,Should a traveller offer the prayers in shortened form in his house or pray in congregation in the mosque?,"If I stay in a city for a temporary period whilst travelling, is it better to offer the prayers in shortened form in my house or to offer them in complete form in congregation in the mosque?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Prayer in congregation is obligatory and it is not permissible for a Muslim not to do that unless he has an excuse. We have already quoted the evidence for that from the Quran and Sunnah. Please see question no. 8918. 
Based on this, you have to offer the prayers in congregation in the mosque. If the imam is a resident (is not travelling) then you should offer the prayer in full with him, and not shorten it. 
Shaykh Ibn Baz was asked: If a person travels to Jeddah, for example, is he allowed to shorten his prayers or does he have to pray with the congregation in the mosque? 
He replied: 
If the traveller is still en route, it does not matter, but if he has reached his destination then he should not pray on his own, rather he has to pray with the people and offer the prayer in full. But if he is still on the road and is alone and the time for prayer comes, there is nothing wrong with him praying on his own and shortening the prayers whilst travelling, making the four-rakah prayers two rak’ahs. 
Majmoo Fatawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’iah li’l-Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baz (12/297). 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was asked: when and how should a traveller pray? 
He replied: 
The traveller may pray two rak’ahs from when he leaves his city or town, until he returns to it, because ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “When the prayer was first enjoined it was two rak’ahs, then the prayer of the traveller remained like that but the prayer of one who is not travelling was increased to four.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1090; Muslim, 685.  
And Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “We went out with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) from Madeenah to Makkah, and we prayed two rak’ahs each time, until we came back to Madeenah. Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1081; Muslim, 693.   
But if a traveller prays with an imam he should pray four rak’ahs, whether he catches up with the prayer from the beginning or he misses part of it, because the general meaning of the Prophet’s words: “When you hear the iqaamah, then walk to the prayer, and you should be tranquil and dignified, and not rush. Whatever you catch up with, pray, and whatever you miss, complete it.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 636; Muslim, 602. The general meaning of the phrase “Whatever you catch up with, pray, and whatever you miss, complete it” includes travellers who pray behind an imam who is offering a four-rak’ah prayer, and others. 
Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) was asked why a traveller should pray two-rak’ahs when he is alone and four when he prays behind a resident. He said: “That is the Sunnah.” Narrated by Muslim, 688; Ahmad, 1865.  
The obligation to pray in congregation is not waived for the traveller, because Allah has enjoined that even in the case of fighting. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“When you (O Messenger Muhammad) are among them, and lead them in As-Salaah (the prayer), let one party of them stand up [in Salaah (prayer)] with you taking their arms with them; when they finish their prostrations, let them take their positions in the rear and let the other party come up which have not yet prayed, and let them pray with you…” [al-Nisa’ 4:102]
Based on this, if the traveller is in a city or town other than his own, he has to attend prayers in congregation in the mosque if he hears the call to prayer, unless he is far away or fears that he may miss meeting up with his travelling companions, because of the general meaning of the evidence which indicates that the one who hears the adhaan or iqaamah is obliged to pray in congregation. 
Majmoo’ Fatawa wa Rasaa’il al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 15/252. 
He was also asked: 
If I am travelling and I hear the call to prayer, do I have to pray in the mosque? If I pray in the place where I am staying, is there anything wrong with that? If the duration of my trip is more than four consecutive days, should I shorten my prayers or offer them in full? 
He replied: If you hear the adhaan when you are in the place where you are staying, then you have to attend the mosque, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to a man who asked him for permission not to pray in congregation: “Can you hear the call?” He said, “Yes.” He said: “Then answer it.” Narrated by Muslim, 6533. And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:  “Whoever hears the call and does not come, there is no prayer for him (i.e., his prayer is not valid), except for one who has an excuse.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 217; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
There is no evidence to indicate that this ruling applies only to the traveller, unless your going to the mosque will cause you some problems in your journey, such as if you need to rest and sleep and you want to pray in the place where you are staying so that you can sleep, or you are afraid that if you go to the mosque the imam will delay the prayer, and you want to leave and you are scared that you may miss the train or plane, etc.
