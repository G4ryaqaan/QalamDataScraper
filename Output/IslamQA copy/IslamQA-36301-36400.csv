I smoke but when I hear the muezzin I enter the mosque. Do I have to repeat my wudoo’, or is rinsing out the mouth sufficient? I know that smoking causes various diseases.",,,Praise be to Allah.It is haraam to sell tobacco because it is evil and causes a great deal of harm. The one who does that is regarded as a faasiq (rebellious evildoer). It is not essential to repeat wudoo’ after smoking but it is prescribed to get rid of the foul smell from the mouth by using something that will take it away. It is also essential to hasten to repent to Allaah from that. End quote.,"From Fataawaa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 13/57"
36359,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/36359,He is going to travel to Jeddah and he does not know whether he will be able to do Hajj or not,"I am going to travel to Jeddah for work purposes before Hajj in sha Allah. It is my intention to do Hajj if I am able, but I may not be able to do Hajj because of my work circumstances. From where should I enter ihraam for Hajj? Should I go back to the meeqaat or enter ihraam from Jeddah?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.You do not have to go back to the meeqaat, 
    rather you should enter ihraam from the place where you are when you decide to do Hajj, whether that is in Jeddah or elsewhere. This is because 
    when you passed the meeqaat you were not firmly resolved that you were going to do Hajj.
 Shaykh Ibn Baaz said:
 Whoever comes to Makkah with the intention 
    of doing Hajj if he can, then it becomes possible for him and he decides to do Hajj, should enter ihraam from the place where he is, whether he is 
    within the meeqaat or in Makkah. If he knows that he will be allowed to do that, then he has to enter ihraam for Hajj from the meeqaat which he 
    passes, when he passes it with the firm resolve to do Hajj. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “They [the 
    meeqaats] are for them [their people] and for anyone who comes to them who is not of their people and intends to do Hajj or ‘Umrah. And whoever is 
    living within these boundaries can enter Ihraam from the place where he decides (to do Hajj), and the people of Makkah can enter ihraam from 
    Makkah.” Agreed upon.

36364,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/36364,It is not prescribed for the pilgrim doing ifraad to do ‘Umrah after Hajj,Is it Sunnah for the pilgrim after completing Hajj to go out to al-Tan’eem and do ‘Umrah as ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) did?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on 
    him) said:
 With regard to what some people do, doing a 
    lot of ‘Umrahs after Hajj from al-Tan’eem of from al-Ji’raanah etc., we have stated above that there is no evidence that it is prescribed to do 
    ‘Umrah after Hajj, rather the evidence indicates that it is better not to do that, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) and his companions did not do ‘Umrah after they had finished Hajj. Rather the ‘Umrah that ‘Aa’ishah did from al-Tan’eem was because she had 
    not done ‘Umrah with the people when they entered Makkah because she was menstruating. So she asked the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) to let her do ‘Umrah to replace the ‘Umrah for which she had entered ihraam from the meeqaat, and the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) let her do that, so she did two ‘Umrahs, the ‘Umrah that went along with Hajj, and this ‘Umrah done on its own. 
    Whoever is in a similar situation to ‘Aa’ishah’s, there is nothing wrong with him or her doing ‘Umrah after completing Hajj, following all the 
    evidence and to make things easier for the Muslims.
 Undoubtedly if all the pilgrims were to do 
    another ‘Umrah after completing Hajj, apart from the ‘Umrah they did when they entered Makkah, this would be too difficult for them all, because 
    there would be too much overcrowding and too many accidents, as well as the fact that it goes against the teachings and Sunnah of the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).","Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn Baaz, 16/46"

Is it permissible for him to take money in order to do Hajj on behalf of a man who has died or who is very old?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for a man to do Hajj on behalf of someone else before he does Hajj for himself. The basic principle concerning that is the report narrated by Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who heard a man saying, “Labbayk ‘an Shubrumah (Here I am [O Allah], on behalf of Shubrumah).” He said, “Have you done Hajj for yourself?” He said, “No.” He said, “Do Hajj for yourself, then on behalf of Shubrumah.” Narrated by Abu Dawood and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Irwa’, 994.

This woman died after breastfeeding another girl who was not her relative; rather she did that as an act of kindness. Are we brothers of this girl? Her father will not allow her to uncover in front of us unless there is a fatwa.,,,"Praise be to Allah.If this 
    woman breastfed the child for five known breastfeedings during the first two 
    years of life, then she is a daughter of the woman and her husband who is 
    the “owner of the milk” – namely your father – and all the children of that 
    woman from her husband, the owner of the milk, or from any other husband 
    will be brothers and sisters of that girl; the children of the husband, the 
    owner of the milk, from the woman who nursed the infant or from any other 
    wife, will also be brothers and sisters of that girl. 
So all of 
    you, siblings born to your father from any of his wives, are all brothers 
    and sisters of that girl.  
Shaykh Ibn 
    Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “If a woman breastfeeds a child 
    for five or more known breastfeedings within the first two years, that child 
    becomes the son or daughter of her and her husband, the owner of the milk, 
    and all the children of that woman, from her husband who is the owner of the 
    milk or any other husband, become brothers and sisters of this infant. The 
    children of the husband who is the owner of the milk, from the wife who 
    breastfed the child or any other wife also become brothers and sisters of 
    the infant. Her brothers become maternal uncles for him, and the brothers of 
    the husband who is the owner of the milk become paternal uncles. The father 
    of the woman becomes a grandfather for the child, as does the father of the 
    husband who is the owner of the milk, and his mother becomes a grandmother 
    to the child, because Allaah says concerning female mahrams in Soorat 
    al-Nisa’ (interpretation of the meaning): 
“your 
    foster mothers who gave you suck, your foster milk suckling sisters”
[al-Nisa’ 
    4:23]
The Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “What becomes mahram 
    (forbidden for marriage) through breastfeeding is that which become mahram 
    through blood ties.” And he said: “There is no breastfeeding (that makes the 
    child a mahram) except in the first two years.” And it was proven in 
    Saheeh Muslim that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: 
    “When the Qur’aan was first revealed, the number of breast-feedings that 
    would make a child a relative (mahram) was ten, then this was abrogated and 
    replaced with the number of five which is well-known, and the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) passed away when this was the 
    case.”

 It is permissible to give a kaafir some of the udhiyah meat in charity so long as this kaafir is not one of those who are killing the Muslims. If he is one of those who are killing them, then he should not be given anything, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Allaah does not forbid you to deal justly and kindly with those who fought not against you on account of religion nor drove you out of your homes. Verily, Allaah loves those who deal with equity.
It is only as regards those who fought against you on account of religion, and have driven you out of your homes, and helped to drive you out, that Allaah forbids you to befriend them. And whosoever will befriend them, then such are the Zaalimoon (wrongdoers those who disobey Allaah)”

 If one is sufficient for us, then is it permissible for my neighbour and I to share in one udhiyah?","One sheep is sufficient as udhiyah for one man and his family and whoever he wants among the Muslims. If two or more people buy a sheep and sacrifice it, that is not sufficient.","Is one sheep sufficient for one man and his family?


Can people share in a sheep?


Can 8 people share in a camel or a cow?","Praise be to Allah.Is one sheep sufficient for one man and his family?
One sheep is sufficient as udhiyah for one man and his family and whoever he wants among the Muslims. ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ordered that a ram with black legs, black belly and black (circles) around the eyes should be brought to him, so that he could sacrifice it. He said to ‘Aishah: “Give me the knife,” and she did that. He took it, then he took the ram, placed it on the ground and then slaughtered it (i.e., prepared to slaughter it), saying: “In the name of Allah, O Allah, accept (this sacrifice) on behalf of Muhammad and the family of Muhammad and the ummah of Muhammad.” Then he sacrificed it. (Narrated by Muslim)
Abu Ayyub al-Ansari (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “At the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), a man would sacrifice a sheep on behalf of himself and his household, and they would eat some and give some to others.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah and by al-Tirmidhi, who classed it as sahih. Also classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi, 1216) 
If a man sacrifices a single sheep or goat on behalf of himself and his family, that will suffice for everyone he intended of his family, whether living or deceased . If he did not intend anything specific then it includes all those who are included in this word (family or household) either customarily or linguistically. 
Customarily, it refers to all those whom he supports of wives, children and relatives. Linguistically, it includes all those who are related to him of his own children and the descendents of his father, grandfather and great-grandfather. 
One-seventh of a camel or cow is equivalent to one sheep. If a man sacrifices one-seventh of a camel or cow on behalf of himself and his family, that is sufficient. Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said that one-seventh of a camel or cow takes the place of a sheep in the case of the hadiy (sacrifice offered during Hajj). So, this applies also to the udhiyah because there is no difference between the udhiyah and the hadiy in this regard. 
Can people share in a sheep?
If two or more people buy a sheep and sacrifice it, that is not sufficient, because no such thing has been narrated in the Quran and Sunnah. 
Can 8 people share in a camel or a cow?
Similarly, if eight or more people share one camel or one cow, that is not sufficient (but it is permissible for seven people to share a camel or cow). This is because acts of worship are as prescribed in the Quran and Sunnah and are not subject to personal opinion. It is not permissible to go beyond the set limits with regard to how much is to be done or the way in which it is to be done. This does not have to do with including others in the reward, because it was narrated that there is no limit to the number of people on whose behalf the sacrifice may be offered.
