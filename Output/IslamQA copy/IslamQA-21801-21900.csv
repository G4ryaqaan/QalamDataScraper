They have children other than me, but I heard a hadith from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), the meaning of which is, “Give it (zakah) to your relatives.” How sound is this hadith? What is the ruling on previous years when I have paid this zakah, noting that I have not kept track of the number of years when I did this?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The hadith mentioned is saheeh; the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to Abu Talhah al-Ansaari, when he wanted to give in charity a date-palm grove of his called Bayraha’, “I think that you should give it to your relatives.” (Saheeh, agreed upon). That was concerning voluntary charity. But in the case of zakah, there are more rulings to be borne in mind: if the relatives are not in the direct line of ascent or descent, it is permissible to give zakah to them if they are poor, and this will be an act of charity as well as upholding ties of kinship. This also applies to your grandfather’s wife, if she is not your real grandmother and she is poor and has no children to spend on her. You have to make up for what you have spent on your maternal grandmother (your mother’s mother) and on your (paternal) grandfather’s wife, if she was of independent means because of someone other than yourself spending on her.

    What is well known among all the scholars, and is the opinion 
    of the majority and almost reaches the point of consensus among the scholars 
    of the righteous salaf, is that zakaah is not to be spent on building 
    mosques or buying books etc., rather it is to be spent on the eight 
    categories which are mentioned in the aayah of Soorat al-Tawbah [9:60], 
    namely: the poor; the needy; those employed to collect the funds; those 
    whose hearts are to be softened towards Islam; to release captives; for 
    those who are in debt; for Allaah’s Cause (i.e., for the mujaahideen); and 
    for wayfarers. The phrase fi sabeel Allaah (for Allaah’s Cause)

21806,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21806,Does Intercourse without Ejaculation Break Your Fast?,"I got married nine years ago. During the first year of marriage I used to engage in foreplay with my wife during the day in Ramadan and I used to have intercourse without ejaculating. I was unaware that that is haram, because I thought that if I did not ejaculate, it would not break the fast. 
After the first year, I did not do that again. That was so that I could avoid doubtful things. 
Since I got married until now, I have repeated what I did during the first year of engaging in foreplay with my wife, but that was during the night in Ramadan and during the night and day at other times of the year, when I had intercourse without ejaculating, and I did not do ghusl because I thought that if I did not ejaculate, I did not need to do ghusl. 
I hope that you will answer, noting that what happened was the result of ignorance on my part, and that you will tell me what my wife and I should do.","1- If a man had intercourse with his wife while fasting and he was unaware of the ruling, and he thought that the kind of intercourse that is haram is the kind in which ejaculation occurs, then he does not have to do anything. 
2- If he knew that intercourse is haram, but he did not know that there is expiation for that, then he has to offer the expiation.","Ruling on intercourse while fasting


The effect of intercourse without ghusl on fasting and prayer","Praise be to Allah.Ruling on intercourse while fasting
If a person who is fasting has intercourse with his wife during the day in Ramadan , one of the following two scenarios must apply: 

He thinks that having intercourse without ejaculating is not haram during the day in Ramadan, so he has intercourse and he is ignorant or unaware of the ruling. 
He knows that having intercourse (during the day in Ramadan ) is haram but he does not know what the punishment is. 

With regard to the first scenario, Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
The most correct view is the view of those who say that whoever does one of the things that break the fast or one of the things that are forbidden during ihram or one of the things that invalidate the prayer and is unaware of it, then there is no sin on him, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error.” [al-Baqarah 2:286] and Allah has said: “I have done that.” 
So if this man who had intercourse with his wife during the day in Ramadan was unaware of the ruling, and he thought that the kind of intercourse that is haram is the kind in which ejaculation occurs, then he does not have to do anything. 
But in the second scenario, if he knew that intercourse (during the day in Ramadan) is haram, but he did not know that there is expiation (kaffarah) for that, then he has to offer the expiation , because there is a difference between ignorance of the ruling and ignorance of the punishment. Ignorance of the punishment is no excuse, but ignorance of the ruling is an excuse. 
Hence the scholars said: If a person drinks an intoxicant thinking that it will not cause intoxication, or thinking that it is not haram, then there is no sin on him. But if he knows that it will cause intoxication and that it is haram, but he does not know that he is to be punished for that, then he should be punished and he is not excused from that. Based on this, we say to the questioner that so long as you did not know that intercourse without ejaculation was haram, there is no sin on you or on your wife, if she was also ignorant of the ruling as you were. 
The effect of intercourse without ghusl on fasting and prayer
With regard to fasting, janabah (being in a state of impurity following sexual activity) does not have any effect on it, because the fasting of a person who is in a state of janabah is valid. 
But not doing ghusl in order to pray poses a problem, because prayer is not valid without doing ghusl because the person remains in a state of janabah. Most of the scholars are of the view that this person must make up all the prayers for which he did not do ghusl, but is it known that this man will have had intercourse and ejaculated, and then done ghusl. 
But he may not know how often he did that. So we say to him that he should try to work it out and do his best to make up the prayers, to be on the safe side. But if you did not know anything about this and it did not cross your mind that simply having intercourse without ejaculating would mean that ghusl was essential, then we hope that you do not have to do anything, i.e., that you do not have to make up the prayers . But you do have to repent and seek forgiveness for your negligence in not asking about the matter.” (Al-Liqa al-Shahri)

21817,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21817,The people of the Cave are the people of the Inscription,"Were the people of the Cave the people of the Inscription, or were these two different groups of people?",,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          Shaykh 
          al-Shanqeeti said, commenting on the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):
 
          “Do 
          you think that the people of the Cave and the Inscription (the news 
          or the names of the people of the Cave) were a wonder among Our Signs?” 
          [al-Kahf 18:9]
 
          The apparent meaning is that the People of the Cave and 
          of the Inscription were all one group, mentioned in conjunction with 
          two things. This is in contrast to those who say that the people of 
          the Cave were one group and the people of the Inscription were another 
          group. Allaah told this story to His Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon them) in this soorah, and He 
          did not mention anything about the people of the Inscription. This is 
          unlike those who claim that the people of the Cave were three persons 
          behind whom the rock fell and blocked the entrance of the cave in which 
          they were, so they prayed to Allaah by virtue of their righteous deeds; 
          they were one who honoured his parents, one who was chaste, and one 
          who was a hired labourer. Their story is well known and is proven in 
          al-Saheeh, but interpreting this aayah as meaning that these 
          were the people referred to therein is far-fetched as you can see. It 
          should be noted there is nothing about the story of the people of the 
          cave, their names and which part of the earth they were in that has 
          been narrated in any sound report from the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), in addition to what is 
          mentioned in the Qur’aan. The Mufassireen quoted many of those details

21818,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21818,The situation of one who is illegitimate and the ruling on marrying him,Is it true that our beloved prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) has strongly forbidden to marry iligitimate person eventhough this person is very pious?,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    There are some ahaadeeth that condemn the illegitimate child, 
    but most of these ahaadeeth are da’eef (weak) and are not saheeh (sound). It 
    was narrated by Abu Dawood in his Sunan (4/39) and by Ahmad in 
    al-Musnad (2/311) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) 
    that the Prophets  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “The illegitimate child is the most evil of the three” meaning more evil 
    than his parents. Among the scholars who classed this as hasan were Ibn 
    al-Qayyim in al-Manaar al-Muneef (133) and al-Albaani in 
    al-Silsilat al-Saheehah (672). 

    The scholars interpreted this hadeeth in a number of ways, 
    the most famous of which was that suggested by Sufyaan al-Thawri, who said: 
    it means he is the most evil of the three if he does the same action as his 
    parents did (i.e., zina or adultery). 

    This was narrated from ‘Aa’ishah, who said that the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “He is the most evil 
    of the threeif he does the same action as 
    his parents did – meaning the illegitimate child.” Although its isnaad is 
    da’eef, it was interpreted in this manner by the salaf, as stated above. 

    This interpretation is supported by the report narrated by 
    al-Haakim (4/100) – with an isnaad of which al-Albaani said, “It may be 
    regarded as hasan” – from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her), that 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The 
    illegitimate child does not bear any part of his parents’ burden of sin.
    ‘and no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of 
    another’ [al-An’aam 6:164 – interpretation of the meaning].” 
    (al-Silsilat al-Saheehah, 2186) 

    Some scholars said that this hadeeth is to be interpreted as 
    meaning that there is some evil in most illegitimate children because they 
    are created from an evil nutfah (sperm drop), and usually nothing good is 
    created from an evil nutfah. If a good soul comes out of this nutfah then it 
    will enter Paradise. This hadeeth is to be taken as a general rule to which 
    there may be exceptions. (See al-Manaar al-Muneef, 133). 

    Hence Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on 
    him) said: “If an illegitimate child believes and does righteous deeds, he 
    will enter Paradise, otherwise he will be punished for his deeds just like 
    anyone else. The punishment is for the deeds, not for the lineage. Rather 
    the illegitimate child is condemned because he is expected to do evil deeds, 
    as often happens. By the same token, good lineages are regarded as 
    praiseworthy because such people are expected to do good deeds. But when a 
    person does a deed, then the reward or punishment is based on that, and the 
    most noble of people before Allaah are those who are most pious. (al-Fataawa 
    al-Kubra, 5/83). 

    It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah: “If an 
    illegitimate child dies in Islam (as a Muslim), he will enter Paradise, and 
    his being illegitimate does not have any effect on that, because that was 
    not due to his own actions, rather it was the action of someone else. Allaah 
    says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    ‘and no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of 
    another’ 

    [al-An’aam 6:164]

    And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    ‘Every person is a pledge for that which he has earned’

    [al-Toor 52:21]

    And there are other similar verses. 

    With regard to the words narrated from the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), ‘No illegitimate child will 
    enter Paradise,’ this hadeeth is not saheeh. It was mentioned by al-Haafiz 
    Ibn Jawzi in al-Mawdoo’aat, but it is one of the ahaadeeth that were 
    fabricated against the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him). And Allaah is the Source of strength.” 

    With regard to the ruling on marrying one who is 
    illegitimate, none of the reputable fuqaha’ have stated that this is haraam. 
    However there was some difference of opinion among the Hanbalis as to 
    whether such a person is compatible with a woman of good lineage. Some of 
    them said that he is compatible with her, and othesr did not agree with that 
    because that will be a source of shame for the woman, because he will be her 
    guardian, and that would also affect her child. (See al-Mughni, 
    7/28).

    (al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 34/282). 

    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked 
    about a man who married his daughter to a person who was apparently 
    illegitimate – what was the ruling on that? He answered as follows: 

    “If he is Muslim, then the marriage is sound, because the sin 
    of his mother and the one who committed zina with her does not rest on him. 
    Allaah says ‘and no bearer of burdens shall bear 
    the burden of another’ [al-An’aam 6:164 – interpretation of the meaning].  
    And there is no shame on him because of their action, if he adheres 
    steadfastly to the religion of Allaah and develops good characteristics, 
    because Allaah says

    ‘O mankind! We have created you from a male and a female, 
    and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another. Verily, 
    the most honourable of you with Allaah is that (believer) who has At-Taqwa 
    [i.e. he is one of the Muttaqoon (the pious)]. Verily, Allaah is 
    All-Knowing, All-Aware’

    [al-Hujuraat 49:13]

    And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said, when he was asked who is the most noble of people, ‘Those who are 
    most pious.’ And he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    ‘If a person’s actions make him less worthy than others, his lineage will 
    not make him more worthy.’”

21819,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21819,Will the person who intends to fast 'Ashura during the day be rewarded for his fasting?,"I know of the virtue of fasting the day of 'Ashura, and that it is expiation for the year that came before. But because we use the Gregorian calendar I did not know when 'Ashura is until the morning of the day itself. I had not eaten anything, so I intended to fast. Is my fast valid, and will I get the reward of this day and receive expiation for the previous year?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.for making you keen to do nafl acts of worship. We ask Him to make us and you steadfast in doing that. 
With regard to your question about forming the intention to fast from the night before, there is sound evidence from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that the intention to observe a nafl fast formed on the morning of the day itself is valid, so long as a person has not ingested anything that breaks the fast after dawn. ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) entered upon his family one day and said: “Do you have anything (i.e., any food)?” They said, “No.” He said, “Then I am fasting.” (Muslim, 1154, 170). The word “idhan” (translated here as “then”, in the sense of “in that case”) indicates that it is permissible to form the intention of observing a nafl fast on the day itself. This is unlike the obligatory fasts, which are not valid unless one forms the intention the night before, because of the hadeeth, “Whoever does not form the intention to fast before dawn, has not fasted.” Abu Dawood, 2454; al-Tirmidhi, 726; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 6535. What is meant here is obligatory fasts. 
Based on this, then your fast is valid. With regard to getting the reward for fasting, will this be reward for the whole day or from the time of the intention only? Shaykh al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
There are two scholarly opinions on this matter. The first is that he will be rewarded from the beginning of the day, because the correct Islamic fast can only be from the start of the day. 
The second view is that he will only be rewarded from the time of his intention, and if he formed the intention at midday then he will be rewarded for half a day. This is the correct view, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Actions are but by intentions, and each person will have but that which he intended.” This man only formed the intention during the day, so he will be rewarded from the time he formed the intention. 
Based on the correct opinion, if a fast is connected to a particular day, such as fasting on Mondays and Thursdays, and fasting on al-ayaam al-beed (the 13th, 14th and 15th of each Hijri month) or fasting three days each month, and a person forms the intention during the day, he will not be rewarded for the entire day.  Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 6/373. 
The same applies to the case of one who did not intend to fast 'Ashura until after dawn had come: he will not get the reward for fasting 'Ashura’, which is the expiation of one year, because his case is not like that of one fasted the whole day of 'Ashura’, rather he only fasted part of it, from the moment he first formed the intention of fasting. 
But he will be rewarded in the general sense of the reward for fasting during the month of Allah Muharram, which is the best kind of fasting after Ramadaan (as it says in Saheeh Muslim, 1163). 
Perhaps one of the main reasons for your and many people’s not knowing when 'Ashura is, or al-ayyaam al-beed, until the day has started, is – as you mention – use of the Gregorian calendar. Perhaps missing out on these special days will motivate you and others whom Allah blesses with guidance, to follow the lunar Hijri calendar which Allah has prescribed for His slaves and approved of for His religion, even if that is only with regard to their personal dealings, so as to revive this calendar which reminds us of different shar’i occasions, and in order to be different from the People of the Book whom we are commanded to differ from and be distinct with regard to their rituals and unique characteristics, especially since the lunar calendar was followed by the earlier Prophets, as may be understood from the hadeeth which mentions the reason why the Jews fasted 'Ashura – which is a day that is known through the lunar calendar. They said that it was the day on which Allah had saved Moosa. This indicates that they followed a lunar calendar and not the months of the solar European calendar.  Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 6/471 
May Allah make your missing out on this special reward, and the missing out of others who are keen like you, lead to a good outcome, so this will make you strive harder in doing good works and acts of worship. This may make you more keen than people who do some act of worship regularly and feel content with what they are doing, and may fill them with self-admiration.

    Firstly: 

    We noticed in your question that you are kind to your father, 
    and this is something to be commended. We urge you to keep honouring your 
    father, for Allaah has enjoined that upon you, and the texts which enjoin 
    that are so well known that we do not need to quote them here. 

    Secondly: 

    We also noticed from your question how hard you are trying 
    not to fall into doing something that would lead to doom and punishment. 
    This indicates – in sha Allaah – that your religious commitment is strong. 
    Your religious commitment is your capital, so beware of squandering it and 
    losing out in this world and in the Hereafter. Keep this fear of falling 
    into immoral actions which would earn you the wrath of Allaah. Always 
    remember that Allaah is watching you, night and day, and remember that He 
    knows the secret and that which is yet more hidden; He knows the fraud of 
    the eyes, and all that the hearts conceal. It is sufficient to imagine if 
    Allaah were to take your soul whilst you – Allaah forbid – were committing a 
    sin: how would you meet Allaah? 

    Thirdly:

     We advise you to fear Allaah, for that will form a barrier 
    between you and immoral actions. We advise you to lower you gaze and avoid 
    looking at anything that Allaah has forbidden. You are only allowed the 
    first glance which happens unintentionally. We advise you not to listen to 
    things that Allaah has forbidden that may provoke desire, and to keep away 
    from bad company and immoral friends who do not want anything for you except 
    Hell in the Hereafter and shame in this world. 

    These are some of the things that make a person fall into 
    immoral actions. The more you keep away from them, the more you will keep 
    away from immorality. After that, we advise you to do acts of worship, 
    especially fasting, which is the remedy recommended by the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in cases such as yours.  

    It was narrated that Ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with 
    him) said: The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said: “O young men, whoever among you can afford to get married, let him do 
    so, and whoever cannot, then let him fast, for it will be a shield for him.”

    (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4778; Muslim, 1400) 

    We advise you to read Qur’aan and to make a lot of du’aa’, 
    asking Allaah to keep you away from temptations both obvious and hidden. We 
    advise you to find good friends who can guide you to the path of 
    righteousness and help you to adhere to it. We also advise you to exercise, 
    and to go to sleep early. 

    There are some of the means which, hopefully, will be the 
    means of keeping you away from everything that is not pleasing to your 
    Lord. 

    We offer you the following useful advice: 

    Ibn Muflih said – quoting from Ibn ‘Aqeel in al-Funoon 
    – You listen to the words “Tell the believing men 
    to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things)” [al-Noor 24:30 – 
    interpretation of the meaning], but you are 
    staring at that which Allaah has forbidden as if you are desperate to 
    acquire it or regretting that you have no way to get it. And you listen to 
    the words, “Some faces that Day shall be Naadirah (shining and radiant)” 
    [al-Qiyaamah 75:22 – interpretation of the meaning] and you think that 
    they were revealed concerning you. And you listen to the words “And some 
    faces that Day will be Baasirah (dark, gloomy, frowning and sad)” 
    [al-Qiyaamah 75:24 – interpretation of the meaning], and you think that 
    they were revealed concerning someone else! How can you be so sure? Where 
    did this wishful thinking come from? This is a kind of deception which 
    stands between you and taqwa. 

    (al-Adaab al-Shar’iyyah, 1/151, 152) 

    Fourthly: 

    With regard to what your father is doing, preventing you from 
    getting married and delaying your marriage, this is a mistake on his part. 
    He should fear Allaah with regard to his sons, and hasten to arrange their 
    marriages. He should realize that the need of some of his sons and daughters 
    for marriage may be greater than their need for food and drink. 

    There follows a fatwa of Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah 
    have mercy on him) on a case that was similar to your father’s: 

    “As Allaah has enjoined upon your father to spend on your 
    food, drink, clothing and accommodation, he must also arrange your marriage 
    if you need to get married, as the scholars have said. 

    I would like to take this opportunity to point out something 
    important, which is that some fathers, even though they are well-off, refuse 
    to arrange their sons’ marriages when the sons ask them to, telling them, 
    ‘Earn enough money to spend on yourself and get married, for you are a man,’ 
    and so on. But the scholars have stated that whoever is obliged to spend on 
    a person is also obliged to keep him chaste and arrange his marriage. So let 
    these fathers fear Allaah and do that which Allaah has enjoined upon them, 
    namely keeping their sons chaste. And Allaah is the Source of strength.”

21833,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21833,Is there any kafaarah (expiation) for a vow to commit sin?,"I vowed that I would not speak to my maternal uncle or enter his house, then I regretted that. Do I have to offer kafaarah?",,,"Praise be to Allah.It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with them both) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Vows are of two kinds: a vow that was for the sake of Allah is expiated by being fulfilled, and that which was for the Shaytaan should not be fulfilled, and he has to offer expiation as in the case of kafaarat yameen (expiation for breaking a oath).” 
Narrated by Ibn al-Jaarood in al-Muntaqaa, 935; al-Bayhaqi, 10/72. 
This hadith was classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albani in al-Silsilat al-Saheehah, 479. 
Shaykh al-Albani said: 
[In this hadith] there is evidence of two things: 
1 – That if a vow concerns an act of worship towards Allah, then it must be fulfilled, and that is its expiation. It was narrated in a saheeh report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: 
“Whoever vows to do an act of obedience towards Allah, then let him do it, and whoever vows to do an act of disobedience towards Allah, then he should not do it.” 
2 – Whoever swears a vow which involves disobeying the Most Merciful (Allah) and obeying the Shaytaan is not permitted to fulfil it, and he has to offer expiation as in the case of kafaarat yameen [i.e., expiation for an unfulfilled oath]. If the vow concerns something makrooh (disliked), or he makes a vow to do something that is mubaah (permissible) [but he does not do it], then it is more apt that he should offer expiation, because of the general meaning of the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “The expiation for a vow is kafaarat yameen.” 
This was narrated by Muslim and others from the hadith of ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Aamir (may Allah be pleased with him), and it is narrated in al-Irwaa’, 8/210. 
What we have mentioned here, both the first and second points, is agreed upon by the scholars, except with regard to the obligation of offering kafaarah for vows concerning sin and so on. The view that it is obligatory is the view of Imaam Ahmad and Ishaaq, as al-Tirmidhi said (1/288). It is also the view of the Hanafis, and this is the correct view because of the hadith quoted above and what we have stated above.

Can the girl whom I have touched force me to marry her by islamic law?,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    You have to ask Allaah for forgiveness and repent to Him for 
    what you have done, and you have to resolve never to go back to that. The 
    fact that you touched this woman does not mean that you are obliged to marry 
    her; there is nothing in Islam that compels a sane adult to marry any woman 
    whom he does not want to marry. No marriage is valid unless it meets the 
    necessary conditions, one of which is the consent of the husband who is 
    accountable.

     You do not have to tell your parents or the girl you are 
    going to marry about what happened; rather you are obliged to conceal what 
    you have done, and to repent, and this is between you and your Lord. The 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Avoid this

21843,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21843,Can Muslims be affected by psychological problems?,Is it possible for a Muslim to be afflicted with psychological problems? (Because some people say that a Muslim cannot be affected by psychological problems).,,,"Praise be to Allah.Undoubtedly man may be afflicted with psychological problems such as worries about the future and grief over the past. Psychological problems affect the body more than physical problems do. We should know that the worries and distress that affect a person are among the things that expiate his sins and reduce the burden of sin; if he is patient and seeks reward with Allaah, he will be rewarded for that. 
Treating these problems in the ways prescribed in Islam is more effective than treating them with physical medicine, as is well known. 
One of the treatments prescribed in Islam is to recite the du’aa’s narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to relieve worries and distress, for example, the saheeh hadeeth narrated from Ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with him): “There is no-one who is afflicted by distress and grief, and says: ‘Allaahumma inni ‘abduka ibn ‘abdika ibn amatija naasyati bi yadika, maada fiyya hukmuka, ‘adlun fiyya qadaa’uka. As’aluka bi kulli ismin huwa laka sammayta bihi nafsaka aw anzaltahu fi kitaabika aw ‘allamtahu ahadan min khalqika aw ista’tharta bihi fi ‘ilm il-ghayb ‘indaka an taj’al al-Qur’aana al-‘Azeema rabee’ qalbi wa noor sadri wa jalaa’ huzni wa dhihaab hammi (O Allaah, I am Your slave, son of Your slave, son of Your maidservant; my forelock is in Your hand, Your command over me is forever executed and Your decree over me is just. I ask You by every name belonging to You which You have named Yourself with, or revealed in Your Book, or You taught to any of Your creation, or You have preserved in the knowledge of the Unseen with You, that You make the Holy Qur’aan the life of my heart and the light of my breast, and a departure for my sorrow and a release for my anxiety),’ but Allaah will take away his distress and grief.” This is one of the remedies prescribed in sharee’ah. One may also say: “Laa ilaaha illa anta, subhaanaka inni kuntu min al-zaalimeen (There is no god but You, glorified (and exalted) are You, truly I have been of the wrongdoers).” [cf. al-Anbiya’ 21:87] 
Another form of treatment is ruqya with which a person may treat himself – which is better. The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to do ruqyah for himself by reciting al-Mi’wadhatayn (the last two soorahs of the Qur’aan) when he went to sleep, then he would wipe his face and whatever he could of his body. Or a person may go to someone whose religious commitment he trusts to do ruqyah for him. 
If he wants to know more, he can refer to what the scholars have written about du’aa’ such as al-Waabil al-Sayyib by Ibn al-Qayyim, al-Kalim al-Tayyib by Shaykh al-Islam, al-Adhkaar by al-Nawawi, and Zaad al-Ma’aad by Ibn al-Qayyim.

          for if he does not have a good intention, he will not be blessed and

What is the ruling according to the four schools?",,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah was asked 
          this question and he replied as follows: 
 
          This condition is not binding according 
          to the madhhab of Imaam al-Shaafa’i, and it is binding on him according 
          to the madhhab of Abu Haneefah, so that when he gets married the divorce 
          takes place, and when he takes a concubine she becomes free. This is 
          also the view of Maalik. With regard to the madhhab of Ahmad, no divorce 
          or manumission takes place, but if he gets married or takes a concubine, 
          the matter is in the woman’s hands: if she wishes, she may stay with 
          him, or if she wishes, she may leave him, because the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The conditions which 
          are most deserving of fulfillment are those by means of which intimacy 
          becomes permissible to you.” And because a man got married subject to 
          the condition that he would not take another wife; he referred the matter 
          to ‘Umar, and he said, “Rights and duties are to be defined in the light 
          of conditions.” 
 
          So there are three views concerning 
          this matter: 
 
          That divorce and manumission take place.
 
          That they do not take place, and that 
          the woman does not have the right to leave him.
 
          The most just of the three views, which 
          is that divorce and manumission do not take place, but that the woman 
          has the right to insist on the condition: if she wishes she may stay 
          with him or if she wishes she may leave him. This is the most moderate

I usually avoid people because I am scared they think badly of me. Is there any solution? Does this mean my faith is weak?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Faith becomes weaker as a result of neglecting obligatory duties and doing haraam things. So long as you are doing your duty towards Allaah and heeded His prohibitions, your introversion and keeping away from people, and your fear of them,  will not harm you. But if your fear keeps you from doing any obligatory duty then you will have committed sin thereby, for example, if your fear stops you attending prayers in congregation in the mosque, or stops you denouncing any evil action that you could change by speaking out or taking action, or stops you from offering advice that you should offer to those who need it. 
You should not give in to these fears or accept them, rather you should look for the causes and try to deal with them. It may help you to know that created beings have no power to bring benefit to themselves or to ward off harm, rather if the nation were to gather together to benefit you in some way, they could not do so unless Allaah has decreed that for you, and if they were to gather together to harm you in some way, they could not do that unless Allaah has decreed that for you. The pens have been lifted and the pages have dried. 
Everything is in the hand of Allaah, and He is the One Whom you should fear and put your hopes in. The criticism of people has no value and carries no weight; it is sufficient for the believer to attain the pleasure of Allaah even if all the people are displeased with him. 
Whoever adheres to the command of Allaah and persists in doing so, is the most honoured of people, for Allaah has decreed honour for His believing slaves. As Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“But honour, power and glory belong to Allaah, and to His Messenger (Muhammad), and to the believers...”
[al-Munaafiqoon 63:8]
The effects of this honour should be manifested in the believer’s words and actions, in all circumstances. He should speak up for the truth, offer sincere advice, remind people and teach them. His approval and anger should be for the sake of Allaah, and he should only get angry when the limits of Allaah are transgressed. 
This is what a person will be able to do when he becomes aware of his role in life, for he is commanded to worship Allaah and to convey and spread His religion as much as he can. This means that he should mix with people and bear any annoyance they cause with patience, especially close relatives. According to a hadeeth narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1307 and Ibn Maajah (4032) from Ibn ‘Umar, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The believer who mixes with people and bears any annoyance they cause with patience, is better than the believer who does not mix with people and does not bear any annoyance they cause with patience.” (This hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, no. 6651). 
Perhaps you can start to get to know some righteous friends with whom you can feel comfortable and secure, who can help you to overcome your feelings of fear of people, and this will help you to find the sincere brotherhood, good treatment, clear goals and sincere intentions that you are missing in the people around you.

Can you pray sitting in the car?


Is offering obligatory prayers sitting down allowed?","Praise be to Allah.Is it permissible to pray in the car?
What you did is not correct, because standing when one is able to do so is an essential part of the prayer. You could pray in the mosque, in the men’s room, after the men have left. If you cannot find a mosque then you can pray on the ground in any place. 
Praying in cars , planes, trains or other means of conveyance, where one cannot face the qiblah or pray standing, is not permissible in the case of obligatory prayers unless two conditions are met: 

There should be the fear that the time for the obligatory prayer will end before reaching your destination. But if you will reach your destination before the time for prayer is over, you should wait until you get there to pray. 
It should not be possible to get off and pray on the ground. If it is possible to do so then you must do that. 

If these two conditions are met, then it is permissible to pray in the vehicle . The evidence for it being permissible to pray in this case is the general meaning of the verses in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope.” [Al-Baqarah 2:286] 
“So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can.” [Al-Taghabun 64:16] 
“and [Allah] has not laid upon you in religion any hardship.” [Al-Hajj 22:78]
Can you pray sitting in the car?
If it is said, if I am allowed to pray in these vehicles, should I face the qiblah and should I pray sitting even though I am able to stand? 
The answer is: 
If you are able to face the qiblah throughout the prayer, then you must do that, because it is a condition of an obligatory prayer being valid whether one is travelling or not. 
If it is not possible to face the qiblah throughout the prayer , then fear Allah as much as you can and do your best, because of the evidence narrated above. 
This has to do with obligatory prayers. With regard to supererogatory (nafl) prayers, the matter is more relaxed; it is permissible for the Muslim to pray in the vehicles mentioned no matter what direction they are facing, even if he could get down on the ground at some times, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to pray nafl prayers on his mount no matter what direction it was facing. 
Jabir narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) “used to pray voluntary prayers when he was riding without facing the qiblah .” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1094). 
But it is better to face the qiblah when starting to pray a nafl prayer, if that is possible when travelling. (See Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 8/124) 
Is offering obligatory prayers sitting down allowed?
With regard to offering obligatory prayers sitting down when one is able to stand, that is not permissible because of the general meaning of the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And stand before Allah with obedience.” [Al-Baqarah 2:238]
 ‘Imran ibn Husayn narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him: “Pray standing; if you cannot, then sitting ; and if you cannot then lying on your side.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1117)

Could you tell about proriety behavior muslim daughter in the moment of death her parents and after that.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    If you are present at the death of one of your parents or 
    relatives, or others, then it is Sunnah for those who are present to remind 
    him to say the Shahaadah. When he has died and his soul has departed, they 
    should close his eyes, because when the soul departs the gaze follows it. At 
    that point it is not permissible to panic and wail and so on. 

    If a person is unable to stay with the one who is dying, 
    because he is afraid and is not used to seeing such things, there is no sin 
    on him, but he should try to get used to such things because it will help 
    him spiritually. It may be an individual obligation (fard ‘ayn) upon 
    a person if there is no one else available, in which case he will be sinning 
    if he does not do it.

     Shaykh ‘Abd al-Kareem al-Khudayr.

     If there is no one else available to close the eyes of the 
    dead Muslim, then cover him, then wash and shroud him, apart from one 
    Muslim, then it becomes obligatory for him to stay with his deceased brother 
    in order to fulfil the obligations towards him. But if there are Muslims 
    available who can do these things, the other Muslims are absolved of 
    responsibility.

     It is prescribed for those who are present when a Muslim is 
    dying to recite Soorah Yaa-Seen for him, for that makes it easier for the 
    soul to depart and makes the dying person more steadfast, as it did in the 
    case of some of the Sahaabah to whom it was read.

     After the person has died and his soul has departed, it is 
    not prescribed to read Qur’aan over him; rather it is prescribed to make 
    du’aa’ for him and pray for forgiveness and mercy for him and for him to be made steadfast when being questioned in the grave.

When a woman uses the sperm of a man, this comes under the same rulings as intercourse in terms of what is halal and what is haram. 
With regard to the child who is born as the result of such a process, he is to be attributed to the mother who bore him, and not to the man who produced the sperm, as is the ruling in the case of zinaa (fornication or adultery). If that man claims to be the father and no one disputes that, then the child may be attributed to him, because the Lawgiver is keen that people should be named after their fathers. With regard to the hadith, “The child belongs to the (marriage-)bed and for the adulterer is the stone,” it is to be interpreted as referring to cases where there is a dispute, as is clear from the incident which gave rise to this hadith.","Majallah al-Da’wah, issue no. 1796, p. 20"

 But if you know that the plane will land before the time for prayer ends and there will be enough time to do the prayer (after it lands), or if the prayer is one of those that may be joined to another, such as Zuhr which may be joined to ‘Asr, or Maghrib which may be joined to ‘Isha, or it is known that the plane will land before the time for the second prayer ends and that there will be enough time to offer both prayers, then the majority of scholars say that it is permissible to offer the prayers on board the airplane, because it is obligatory to offer the prayers when the time for the prayer begins. But some later Maaliki scholars said that prayer on board the airplane is not valid, because one of the conditions of prayer being valid is that the prayer should be offered on the ground, or on something which is in contact with the ground, such as a vehicle or ship, for example.

•	If your Muslim brother did something you do not agree with, or the issue is a matter of different opinions, then you should explain to him that you do not agree with what he did, or with his mistaken point of view.",,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to forsake a Muslim, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible for a man to forsake his Muslim brother for more than three days, each of them turning away from the other when they meet. The better of them is the one who gives the greeting of Salam first.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 5727; Muslim, 2560)
If the believer is a relative, such as a brother, nephew, uncle or cousin, then forsaking is an even worse sin. 
This applies unless the person is committing a sin and there is an interest to be served by forsaking him, i.e., it will make him give up the sin. In that case, there is nothing wrong with it because this comes under the heading of removing evil. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever among you sees an evil action, let him change it with his hand [by taking action]; if he cannot, then with his tongue [by speaking out]; if he cannot then with his heart [by hating it and feeling that it is wrong], and that is the weakest level of faith.” (Narrated by Muslim, 49)  
The basic principle is that it is prohibited for a Muslim to forsake his fellow-Muslim unless there is a reason to allow it. (See Fatawa Manar Al-Islam, by Ibn ‘Uthaymin, vol. 3, p. 732) 
Wali Al-Din Al-‘Iraqi said: 
“This prohibition applies in cases where the forsaking is caused by anger with regard to something permissible and has nothing to do with religion. With regard to forsaking someone for a religious reason, such as his committing sin or Bid`ah; this is not prohibited. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded (his companions) to forsake Ka`b ibn Malik, Hilal ibn Umayyah and Mararah ibn Al-Rabi’ (may Allah be pleased with them). Ibn ‘Abd Al-Barr said: This Hadith of Ka`b indicates that it is permissible for a man to forsake his Muslim brother if he commits some act of Bid’ah or immorality, in the hope that forsaking him may discipline him and serve as a rebuke to him. Abu Al-‘Abbas Al-Qurtubi said: With regard to forsaking a person because of sin or Bid`ah, it should be continued until he repents from that and does not go back to it. Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr also said: The scholars are unanimously agreed that it is impermissible for a Muslim to forsake his fellow-Muslim for more than three days, unless there is the fear that speaking to him and keeping in touch with him will affect one’s religious commitment or have some harmful effect on one's spiritual and worldly interests. If that is the case, it is permissible to avoid him, because peaceful avoidance is better than harmful mixing."" (Tarh Al-Tathrib, 8/99)
What you should do, if your brother has done something prohibited, is to advise him and explain that this thing is prohibited, and remind him of Allah. If you see that he is persisting in his sin and you think that forsaking him will serve a purpose, then it is permissible to do so, as stated above. But if he has simply done something that you do not agree with, or it is the matter of different points of view, then you should explain to him that you do not agree with what he has done, or with his mistaken point of view. But if you make forsaking him the sign of your disagreeing with him, this may lead to him rejecting your view completely, let alone the fact that this is not a legitimate Islamic justification for forsaking him for more than three days. We have seen above in the Fatwa of Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin that the basic principle is that it is prohibited for a Muslim to forsake his fellow-Muslim, unless there is a reason to allow it. 
The Muslim must be forbearing and sincere towards his brothers, he must be tolerant towards them and overlook their mistakes. He should not hasten to adopt a solution that may cause division and prohibited kinds of forsaking. May Allah help us all to do that which He loves and which pleases Him.

Is it correct to do this?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Ibn Muflih said: 
“We should not stop doing what is prescribed in Islam for fear of showing off.” 
One of the things that may happen to a person is that he wants to do an act of worship, but something happens that makes him stop doing it for fear that he may be showing off in some way. He should not pay attention to that. We should do what Allah has commanded and encouraged us to do, and seek the help of Allah, and put our trust in Him that He will help us to do the action in the manner prescribed in sharee’ah. 
Shaykh Muhiy al-Deen al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: We should not stop remembering Allah (dhikr) with our tongues as well as in our hearts for fear that people may think that we are showing off; rather we should remember Allah with both, seeking the pleasure of Allah thereby. He mentioned what al-Fudayl ibn ‘Iyaad (may Allah have mercy on him) said: that not doing something because of people was (a form of) showing off, and doing something because of people was (a form of) shirk. He said: if we start to pay attention to people and try to protect ourselves from their thinking badly of us, that would stop us from doing a lot of good deeds. Abu’l-Faraj ibn al-Jawzi said: As for not doing an act of worship for fear of showing off, if the motive for doing that act of worship is something other than religious commitment, then he should refrain from doing it, because it is a sin. But if the motive for doing it is religious commitment and he does it sincerely for the sake of Allah, then he should not refrain from doing it, because the motive is religious commitment. Similarly, if he refrains from doing a righteous deed for fear that he will be called a show-off, he should not do that (refrain from that deed) because this is one of the traps of the Shaytaan. 
Ibraaheem al-Nakha’i said: if the Shaytaan comes to you whilst you are praying and says, “you are showing off,” then make your prayer longer. With regard to the report that one of the salaf stopped praying for fear of showing off, this is to be interpreted as meaning that they felt as if they were showing off, so they gave up. This is as he said. For example, al-A’mash said, “I was with Ibraaheem al-Nakha’i and he was reading Quran. A man asked permission to enter and he covered the Mus-haf and said, ‘He should not think that I read it all the time.’ If we should not stop doing acts of worship for fear of showing off, then it is more appropriate that we should not refrain from doing them for fear of the self-admiration that may come after doing them. 
We have discussed above the issue of self-admiration before the chapters on enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil. We mentioned before the chapter on clothing the issue of visiting the ruler in order to enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil, and we quoted the opinion of Dawood al-Taa’i who said, ‘I fear that he may be punished by the whip.’ It was said to him, ‘He can bear that.’ He said, ‘I fear that he may be executed by the sword.’ It was said to him, ‘He can bear that.’ Then he said, ‘I fear that he may be afflicted by the hidden disease’, i.e., self-admiration.","Al-Adaab al-Shar’iyyah by Ibn Muflih, 1/267, 268"

There is no specific du`a narrated in the hadiths for Sujud Ash-Shukr. Hence the scholars said that what is to be said in Sujud Ash-Shukr is the same tasbih and du`a as are said when prostrating in prayer. 
So one should say “Subhana Rabbiy al-A’la.

Only a few months ago I came to the point when I asked my husband for a divorce because he neglected his Salaat even though he had been told about his duties, and he also had developed a bad habit of threatening with divorce and actually throwing me out of the house when he lost his temper. But when he realised that I was actually going to leave him, he repented and changed his ways, so I withdrew my question and returned. But there is still some tension between us. This is mostly due to the fact that as it is today, my husbands eeman is weaker than mine. I do not think I am perfect, and I know I also make mistakes. But I constantly see my husband doing things that are wrong (both things haram and makruh), and I cannot restrain myself and not speak to him about it. This is for example like using bad language in front of our daughter, or biting and kissing her in places where she should rather learn shyness, etc. When I tell him that it is not good to do these things, and sometimes I am able to give evidence from Qur'an and Sunna, he will either say that he knows this, and then continue with what he is doing, or become angry and tell me to mind my own business. This is a source of irritation for both me and my husband, and we are losing patience with each other. My question is: What is my test from Allah here? Is it not my duty to inform or remind him of what is right when I know it? Or should I be patient with him and wait till he finds out for himself, because he has started to read Islamic books. The reason I need some advise on this issue, is that my husband is getting quite annoyed with these reminders, and I am losing patience and becoming angry when he doesen't listen. Please try to give some advise, and please show the evidence from Qur'an or Sunnah that you lay to ground for your advise.",,,"Praise be to Allah.We praise Allaah for having blessed you and 
    guided you to obey Him and please Him, and that your husband has been guided to change the way he treats you. We hope that this will give you hope 
    that your husband will improve and mend his ways, in sha Allah. 
You should note that a righteous woman can 
    change many of her husband’s attitude and habits, if she goes about doing so in a wise and kindly manner, without being hasty. 
Some husbands are put off by repeated advice 
    from their wives, especially if that is in the presence of their children, because they may see that as an affront to their dignity or a 
    belittling of their character. 
Hence you should pay proper attention to 
    that, and choose the right moment to advise him from time to time. You should also be kind and loving towards him when offering advice, in the 
    hope that he will respond. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Invite (mankind, O Muhammad) to the way of your Lord (i.e. Islam) with wisdom (i.e. with the 
    Divine Revelation and the Qur’aan) and fair preaching, and argue with them in a way that is better”
[al-Nahl 16:125]
And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “Kindness is not present in a thing but it makes it beautiful, and it is not missing from a thing but it makes it ugly.” 
    (Narrated by Muslim, 2594, from the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah, may Allaah be pleased with her). 
The husband is the most deserving of people 
    to be treated kindly, because of his status and position. 
We advise you to use various means to 
    accomplish your mission, such as giving him some tapes and books, or bringing them home and leaving them near him, turning to Allaah and asking 
    Him to put things right between you and to open your husband’s heart so that he will know the truth and act in accordance with it.
