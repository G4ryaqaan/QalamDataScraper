He also stays up at night a great deal. She got tired of advising him and asking him to give it up, and he refused to do so. Is it permissible for her to live with him knowing that she has two children from him. She is in another Arab country and is suffering from loneliness. What do you advise her to do, may Allaah reward you?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: we ask Allaah to help your sister to deal with this 
    calamity and to bring her relief, and to guide her husband to give up this 
    major sin in which he is persisting. 

    With regard to the ruling on her staying with him, it is 
    permissible for her to do so if she is certain that she and her children 
    will be safe. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen 
    (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: I think that if she has advised him and 
    he has not responded, then she has the right to ask for an annulment of the 
    marriage. But there may be reasons why she cannot annul the marriage, 
    because she has children and annulment may cause further problems. If his 
    sin does not reach the level of kufr, then there is no sin on her if she 
    stays with him for fear of evil consequences. But if his sin reaches the 
    level of kufr, such as if he does not pray, then she should not stay with 
    him a second longer. 

    Al-Liqa’ al-Maftooh, Q. 518. 

    Secondly: Our advice to her is that she should weigh up what 
    is in her best interests, and consult her family and relatives, who know her 
    situation best. Then she should ask Allaah’s guidance (by praying 
    istikhaarah), for Allaah will never let her down. As the report says: No one 
    loses by praying istikhaarah and no one regrets consulting others. Whether 
    she chooses to annul the marriage or to stay, let her accept what Allaah has 
    decreed for her and be patient and seek reward. Allaah says (interpretation 
    of the meaning): 

    “but give glad tidings to As‑ Saabiroon (the patient)”

    It is not permissible for your maternal uncle to marry your 
    daughter, because a man’s maternal uncle is also the maternal uncle of his 
    sons and daughters. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Forbidden to you (for 
    marriage) are: your mothers, your daughters, your sisters, your father’s 
    sisters, your mother’s sisters, your brother’s daughters, your sister’s 
    daughters, your foster mothers who gave you suck, your foster milk suckling 
    sisters, your wives’ mothers, your stepdaughters under your guardianship, 
    born of your wives to whom you have gone in — but there is no sin on you if 
    you have not gone in them (to marry their daughters), — the wives of your 
    sons who (spring) from your own loins, and two sisters in wedlock at the 
    same time, except for what has already passed; verily, Allaah is 
    Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:23]

    The words “your sister’s daughters” indicate that all 
    daughters of one’s sister are forbidden in marriage, no matter how far the 
    line of descent extends. This includes the daughter of the sister’s daughter 
    and the daughter of the sister’s son, no matter how far the line of descent 
    extends. Al-Qaasimi said: Also included with daughters are their children.

47354,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47354,Can traders agree on prices before they submit their tenders?,"Is it permissible for a group of traders to agree on prices before they submit their tenders, after they learn of the amount allocated for this particular deal, in order to prevent another trader undercutting them, and after one of them wins the deal, they will share it with one another.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    It is not permissible for the traders to agree on prices 
    before submitting their tenders, because that harms the one who is seeing 
    the deal, who only invited them to submit their tenders in order to get the 
    best deal. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said: “Leave the people alone (to engage in trade), and Allaah will provide 
    for some of them by means of others.” Narrated by Muslim, 1522. Moreover, 
    agreeing in advance and sharing out the deal among the traders without the 
    knowledge of the agent is deceiving him, and in the hadeeth it says, 
    “Whoever deceives us is not one of us.” Narrated by Muslim, 101. 

    The Standing Committee was asked about buyers at an auction 
    agreeing not to increase the price beyond a specific limit. They replied: 

    The agreement between buyers to stop when the price at an 
    auction reaches a certain limit is a kind of selfishness, which will cause 
    harm to the sellers of the product. Both selfishness and harming others are 
    forbidden. This is a bad attitude that does not befit the Muslims and is not 
    approved of by Islamic sharee’ah. The seller who is affected by such a 
    conspiracy not to raise the price beyond a pre-set limit has the choice, if 
    he realizes that he has been cheated, of either annulling the sale or 
    allowing it to proceed. 

    Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 
    13/114. 
The Muslim should strive 
    to ensure that his food comes from good, halaal sources. The Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Every body that is 
    nourished from haraam sources, the Fire is more suited for it.” Narrated by 
    al-Tabaraani and Abu Na’eem from Abu Bakr; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani 
    in Saheeh al-Jaami’, no. 4519.

     It was also narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 614, from the hadeeth 
    of Ka’b ibn ‘Ajrah, where the wording is: “No flesh grows that was nourished 
    from haraam sources, but the Fire is more suited for it.”

47357,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47357,Ruling on passing the meeqaat without entering ihraam,I passed the meeqaat when I was on board the plane. What should I do?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Entering ihraam from the meeqaat is one of the obligatory actions of Hajj and ‘Umrah. It is not permissible for anyone to pass the meeqaat without entering ihraam if he intends to do either Hajj or ‘Umrah, whether he comes by land, sea or air. 
Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about the ruling on passing the meeqaat without entering ihraam, and he replied as follows: If a person passes the meeqaat without entering ihraam, one of two scenarios must apply:  
Either he is intending to perform Hajj or ‘Umrah, in which case he must go back to it and enter ihraam for the ritual he intends to perform, Hajj or ‘Umrah; if he does not do that then he has omitted one of the obligatory actions of the pilgrimage and according to the scholars he must offer a ransom, a sacrifice to be slaughtered in Makkah and its meat distributed to the poor there; 
Or he passed it and does not intend to perform Hajj or ‘Umrah, in which case he does not have to do anything, regardless of whether he was away from Makkah for a long time or a short time. That is because if we say that he has to enter ihraam from the meeqaat, that would mean that it was obligatory for him to do Hajj or ‘Umrah more than once, but it was proven from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that Hajj is obligatory only once in a lifetime, and if a person does more than that then it is a voluntary act of worship. This is the most correct scholarly view concerning the one who passes the meeqaat without entering ihraam, i.e., if he does not intend to do Hajj or ‘Umrah then he does not have to do anything, and he does not have to enter ihraam from the meeqaat. 
Fiqh al-‘Ibaadaat, 283; Fataawa Arkaan al-Islam, p. 513. 
Based on this, then what you should have done is to go back to the meeqaat after the plane landed and entered ihraam from there. If you did not go back and you entered ihraam after passing the meeqaat, then according to the scholars you have to slaughter a sheep and distribute its meat to the poor in Makkah.

47396,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/47396,Ruling on working as the manager of an Internet café,"I work as the manager of an internet café (a place where individuals can rent computers to access the internet in return for payment of a fee). But some of the people misuse the internet to chat with girls, knowing that there is a video camera and they can see the other party. Some people go to Islamic sites and some go to do some work, and some speak to their family and relatives in other countries. Is this work of mine haraam, or is the sin on those who misuse the internet? Please note that I am not the owner of the café, i.e., I cannot prevent that, and I do not have any other work apart from this and I need the job, because job opportunities are few and far between and I was out of work for six months.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Undoubtedly the burden of sin rests primarily on the one who 
    commits the haraam action, whether that is looking, writing or speaking, but 
    a share of it also rests on the one who helps him to do that and makes it 
    easy for him, and also on the one who sees an evil action but does not 
    denounce it. In the answer to question no. 
    
    34672 we have stated the 
    ruling on working in an internet café: 

    It is not permissible to work or invest in internet cafes 
    unless they are free of evils. That includes not allowing patrons to enter 
    haraam sites, by blocking them or by throwing those patrons out if they 
    persist in using them. That is because Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “Help you one another in Al‑Birr and At‑Taqwa (virtue, 
    righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and 
    transgression. And fear Allaah. Verily, Allaah is Severe in punishment”

    [al-Maa'idah 5:2]
And the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever among you sees an 
    evil action, let him change it with his hand (by taking action); if he 
    cannot, then with his tongue (by speaking out); and if he cannot then with 
    his heart (by hating it and feeling that it is wrong), but that is the 
    weakest of faith.” Narrated by Muslim, 49. 

    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
    Denouncing it in one’s heart is obligatory for everyone. That means hating 
    the evil action and shunning those who do it, if one is unable to denounce 
    it by taking action or speaking out.” From: al-Durar al-Saniyah fi 
    al-Ajwabah al-Najdiyyah, 16/142. 

    If it not possible to regulate what happens in this café and 
    prevent evil things, it is not permissible to open such a café, as a 
    precaution against falling into sin and disobedience. 

    If you cannot denounce evil in this café then you should save 
    yourself and shun those who commit sin. There is no guarantee that the wrath 
    and anger of Allaah will not befall them. Look for permissible work from 
    which you can acquire permissible wealth. We remind you that Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And it has already been 
    revealed to you in the Book (this Qur’aan) that when you hear the Verses of 
    Allaah being denied and mocked at, then sit not with them, until they engage 
    in a talk other than that; (but if you stayed with them) certainly in that 
    case you would be like them”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:140]

    Al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his 
    Tafseer: The words “then sit not with them, until they engage in a 
    talk other than that” mean: words other than kufr. “(But if you 
    stayed with them) certainly in that case you would be like them” – this 
    indicates that it is essential to avoid sinful people if they commit some 
    evil action, because whoever does not avoid them is in effect approving of 
    their actions, and approval of kufr is itself kufr. Allaah says, “you 
    would be like them”, so whoever sits in a gathering of sin and does not 
    denounce them bears a burden of sin just like theirs. 

    They should be denounced if they speak of sin or commit sin. 
    If a person is not able to denounce them then he should get up and leave so 
    that he will not be one of those mentioned in this verse. 

    It was narrated from ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez that he 
    punished some people for drinking alcohol, and it was said to him concerning 
    one of those who were present that he was fasting. So he punished that man 
    more severely and recited this verse: “you would be like them” – 
    i.e., approving of sin is in itself a sin. Hence the one who does the action 
    and the one who approves of it are both to be subjected to the punishment 
    for that sin, so they are all doomed. (5/418). 

    Moreover there is the fear that if a person works in these 
    places his faith will become weak and the sense of protective jealousy 
    (gheerah) will vanish from his heart. The Shaytaan may even entice him to 
    commit sin. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! 
    Follow not the footsteps of Shaytaan (Satan). And whosoever follows the 
    footsteps of Shaytaan (Satan), then, verily, he commands Al‑Fahsha’ [i.e. to 
    commit indecency (illegal sexual intercourse)], and Al‑Munkar [disbelief and 
    polytheism (i.e. to do evil and wicked deeds; and to speak or to do what is 
    forbidden in Islam)]”

    [al-Noor 24:21]

    It should be noted that whoever gives up something for the 
    sake of Allaah, Allaah will compensate him with something better than it, 
    and that what is with Allaah can only be attained by obeying Him. Allaah 
    says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He 
    will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty).

    3. And He will provide him from (sources) he never could 
    imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allaah, then He will suffice him. 
    Verily, Allaah will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allaah has set a measure 
    for all things”

My worship has become noticeably less, not because of anything that is distracting me but because I have become depressed. I am learning to memorize Qur’aan with a teacher but I am still in Juz’ ‘Amma (the 30th juz’). I memorize what is required of me, but I still have too much spare time. In an attempt to rid myself of depression I turn on the TV, but I hate it and I do not really want to watch it, but I sit in front of it for ten hours. Can you believe it – ten hours? And I used to watch it only a little. I don’t know. Please advise me as to how I may kill this spare time.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The blessing of time is one of the greatest blessings that Allaah can bestow upon His slaves. Allaah even swears by time in some cases, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“By Al‑‘Asr (the time)”
[al-‘Asr 103:1]
- because of the importance and blessing of time.  
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Make the most of five things before five others: life before death, health before sickness, free time before becoming busy, youth before old age, and wealth before poverty.” See Saheeh al-Jaami’, no. 1077. 
But most people are unaware of the importance of this blessing and are neglectful of their duties towards it, namely to fill it with acts of gratitude and obedience towards Allaah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There are two blessings which many people do not make the most of and thus lose out: good health and free time.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6412. 
Al-Teebi said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) likened the Muslim (who is accountable for his deeds) to a merchant who has capital and seeks to make a profit whilst also preserving his capital. The way to do that is to look for the right people to deal with and he himself will be honest and will try to be smart lest he be cheated. Good health and free time are our capital, and we should deal with Allaah with faith, striving against the evil inclinations of our nafs and the enemy of religion i.e., the Shaytaan, so that we may attain the best in this world and in the Hereafter. This is similar to what is mentioned in the passage where Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Shall I guide you to a trade that will save you from a painful torment?”
[al-Saff 61:10]
We should avoid following the dictates of the nafs and keep away from the Shaytaan lest we lose both our capital and our profit. 
Fath al-Baari by Ibn Hajar. 
If time is so important, then the Muslim should not have any free time, for he should be going from one act of worship and obedience to another. If he cannot spend all his time going from one act of obedience and worship to another then, he may spend some of his time in permissible pursuits, in which he should ensure that his intention is correct, so that he may earn reward thereby, as Mu’aadh (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “I get up and I sleep, and I hope for the same when I sleep as I hope for when I get up.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6923; Muslim, 1854. 
The problem that the sister is suffering from is caused by several things: 
Firstly: she does not understand the value of time. This is true of many people, as stated above. Even worse than that, by neglecting this great blessing, her spare time has become something destructive, and she regards it as an enemy that she wants to kill, but she does not realize that she is killing herself.  
Secondly: she feels depressed. There is no doubt that wasting one's time and one's life causes deep depression in man, because he feels that he is like an animal that eats so it can sleep, and sleeps so it can eat. Hence we see many disbelievers ended their life by suicide, after being afflicted by depression and other incurable diseases – may Allaah keep us safe and sound from that with which He has tested them. One of the primary causes of depression is disobedience towards Allaah. Undoubtedly wasting time watching TV leads a person to commit sin, such as watching and listening to haraam things, wasting time, and other things caused by this evil machine. The benefits that the sister gains by joining a halaqah for memorizing Qur’aan are largely cancelled out, if not erased entirely, by sitting in front of the TV. Just as good deeds erase bad deeds, bad deeds cause good deeds to be lost. 
[You can refer to the Books section of this website; in  Dealing with Worries and Stress you will find more details about the causes of worry and how to overcome them. In  Dangers Facing the Home you will find mention of some of the harmful effects of TV.] 
Thirdly:  
She has given up with regard to time, and she has no determination to fill her time with beneficial things. 
In order to solve this problem, the sister must strive to achieve the following: 
1-Doing acts of worship such as reciting dhikr and wird, praying, reading Qur’aan, fasting and thinking about the signs and blessings of Allaah.
2-She should pay special attention to the Qur’aan, since she says that she memorizes what is required of her, then she has spare time that she kills by watching TV. Why doesn’t she use that time to remember Allaah and read Qur’aan, and memorize more so that she can memorize the whole Qur’aan, before she becomes burdened with the responsibilities of life. For (reading) each letter is a hasanah, and each hasanah brings a tenfold reward. And each verse raises one in status and increases one’s reward, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Read and rise (in status), for as you used to recite in this world, your position (in the Hereafter) will be determined by the last verse you read.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 1464; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Saheehah, 2240.
3-Adopt a cause affecting Muslim women in the country where you live, such as helping to teach Muslim girls, undertaking charitable projects, and so on.
4-Find good and righteous friends with whom you can meet and get together.
5-Read Islamic books in particular and useful stories in general.
6-Get involved in da’wah, women’s activities and children’s sports in Islamic centres.
7-Listen to tapes and lectures, and write summaries which you can distribute to those who will benefit from them.
8-Learn some useful areas of worldly knowledge such as cooking, sewing, etc.
9-Learn about computers and useful programs, for this is a vast area which will take up a lot of time and can be used to do a lot of good and useful things. This will take you away from sitting in front of the TV which does not help you in any way, and does more harm than good.
10-You should read some books which speak of the importance of time and how to manage it; listen to some useful lectures on this topic too.
May Allaah help you and us to do all that is good.
