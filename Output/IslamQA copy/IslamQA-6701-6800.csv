6703,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6703,It is Easy to Enter Islam,My father is African American and my mother is white and I have done a lot of research on this religion. I am 16 and I really want to become a Muslim. I wanted to know if I could be one?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Among the beauties of Islam is the fact that in this religion there are no intermediaries in the relationship between a person and his Lord. Entering this religion does not involve any special ceremonies or procedures that need to be done in front of any other person, nor does it require the consent of any specific people. Becoming Muslim is very easy and anyone can do it even if he is all alone in the desert or in a locked room. All it takes is to say two beautiful sentences which sum up the meaning of Islam and which include the statement that a person is the slave of his Lord and that he submits himself to Him and recognizes that He is his God and Helper and Protector Who decrees for him whatever He wills; and that Muhammad is the slave and Messenger of Allah whom he must follow with regard to what was revealed to him from Allah, for obeying the Messenger is part of obeying Allah. Whoever utters these twin statements of faith, with conviction and believing in them, becomes a Muslim, sharing all the rights and duties that other Muslims have. After that he can start straight away to do the things that Allah has made obligatory, such as the five daily prayers at the right times, fasting during the month of Ramadaan, and so on. From this it should be clear to you that you can become a Muslim straight away, so get up, have a shower and say: “Ash-hadu an laa ilaaha ill-Allah wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadan ‘abduhu wa rasooluhu (I bear witness that there is no god except Allah and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger).” For more information, see
those who want to become Muslim. May Allah help you to do all that is good and guide your steps aright. May He decree for you happiness in this world and the next. Peace be upon those who follow true guidance.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
6706,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6706,He wants to become    Muslim but he is worried that he will not be able to do the prayers at work,"I am very interested in Islam and I know for certain that it is the one true religion. But, I am definitely going to join the United States Army. I wouldn't have time for prayer at the correct times during the day due to training, etc. Still, I want to become a muslim as soon as possible because death could come at any time, but I am unsure I could stick to the strict praying schedule in the Army. Any advice?",,,"Praise be to Allah.And again, praise be to Allaah for having blessed you with this conviction about the religion of Islam. Hasten to enter this religion now, no matter what your circumstances, and know that entering Islam is the first duty that you must do. A man who was clad in armour came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said, O Messenger of Allaah, should I fight or should I become Muslim? He said, Become Muslim, then fight. So the man became Muslim, then he fought, and he was killed. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: He did little but his reward will be great.
(Reported by al-Bukhaari, 2597). He told him to enter Islam before he fought to make the word of Allaah prevail, even though the man came to him at the time of battle when the kuffaar had arrived to wage war against the Muslims. So know that there no difficulties should make you delay becoming Muslim, for once you become Muslim Allaah will make it easy for you to do the five prayers on time and other duties, so long as your intention towards Allaah is sincere and you ask Him to help you, as the Muslim always says in his prayer (interpretation of the meaning):
You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything). [al-Faatihah 1:5]
The times of the five daily prayers are fairly broad, al-hamdu Lillaah, and you can do the prayer in any part of the time prescribed. If a person can take a few minutes to relieve himself in the washroom, surely it is more important that he be allowed to take a few minutes to do his prayer. Moreover in many parts of the West the individual is granted the right to freedom of worship, so you could utilize this to demand your right to practise your religion and do your prayers on time. We ask Allaah to open the gates of goodness to you and to make matters easy for you. May He decree for you success in this world and the next, for Allaah is the Owner of great Bounty.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

6711,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6711,How Angels Protected the Prophet,"Is there a hadith (prophetic narration) saying that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was protected by a jinn when the wife of Abu Lahab came to harm him? If so, please reply, or is there any other hadith regarding the wife of Abu Lahab??",,,"Praise be to Allah.The idea that one of the jinn used to protect the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) from the wife of Abu Lahab needs real evidence. The person who said this has to produce evidence for it. Perhaps he is confused, because what was reported was that the angels, by the command of Allah, protected the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) from the wife of Abu Lahab, as we shall see.
Allah, may He be exalted, guaranteed to protect His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), as He said (interpretation of the meaning): “Allah will protect you from mankind.” [5:67]. One of the ways in which He protected His Prophet was by subjugating His angels to protect and guard him. So they hid him from the sight of the wife of Abu Lahab, and she did not see him. The evidence for this is the report narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father), who said: “When the words ‘Perish the two hands of Abu Lahab’ [111:1 – interpretation of the meaning] were revealed, the wife of Abu Lahab came when the Messenger of Allah  (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was sitting with Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him). Abu Bakr said to him, ‘Why do you not move out of her way so that she will not harm you, O Messenger of Allah?’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘There will be a barrier between me and her.’ She came and stood over Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) and said, ‘O Abu Bakr, your companion has lampooned us.’ Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) said, ‘No, by the Lord of this House, he has not spoken poetry and he does not utter verse.’ She said, ‘You are speaking the truth.’ When she went away, Abu Bakr ((may Allah be pleased with him) said, ‘Did she not see you?’ He said, ‘No, an angel was covering me until she went away.’” [ al-Bazzaar in al-Musnad].
(b) Among the ahaadeeth (narrations) that have been narrated concerning her, may Allah curse her:
From Jundub ibn Sufyan (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) fell ill and did not stay up and pray Qiyam (late night voluntary prayers) for two or three nights; then a woman came and said, ‘O Muhammad! I hope that your shaytan has left you! I have not seen him coming near you for two or three nights!’ Then Allah revealed the words (interpretation of the meaning): ‘By the forenoon (after sunrise). By the night when it darkens (and stands still). Your Lord (O Muhammad) has neither forsaken you nor hates you.” [93:1-3] [al-Bukhaari and Muslim].
Al-Hafiz ibn Hajar said: the words “a woman came” refer to Umm Jameel bint Harb, the wife of Abu Lahab. We have already stated this in Kitab Qiyam al-Layl. [Fath al-Baari].
Further evidence of the angels guarding the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) by the command of Allah is to be seen in another incident with Abu Jahl, which was reported by Imam Muslim (may Allah have mercy on him) in his Saheeh from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: Abu Jahl asked, “Does Muhammad rub his face in the dust (i.e. does he prostrate when he prays at the K’abah) when he is among you?” He was told, “Yes.” He said, “By al-Laat and al-‘Uzza, if I see him doing that, I will step on his neck or I will rub his face in the dust.” Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came and prayed. He (Abu Jahl) had claimed that he would step on his neck, but suddenly all they saw was that he was running away, raising his hands to protect himself. It was said to him, “What is the matter with you?” He said, “There is a ditch of fire and terror and wings between me and him. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If he had come near me, the angels would have snatched him piece by piece.” Then Allah revealed the words (interpretation of the meaning):
“Nay! Verily, man does transgress (in disbelief and evil deeds).
Because he considers himself self-sufficient.
Surely, unto your Lord is the return.
Have you (O Muhammad) seen him (i.e. Abu Jahl) who prevents
A slave (Muhammad) when he prays?
Tell me if he (Muhammad) is on the guidance (of Allah)
Or enjoins piety?
Tell me if he (Abu Jahl) denies (the truth, i.e. this Quran) and turns away?
Knows he not that Allah does see (what he does)?
Nay! If he (Abu Jahl) ceases not, We will catch him by the forelock —
A lying, sinful forelock!
Then let him call upon his council (of helpers).
We will call out the guards of Hell (to deal with him)!
Nay! (O Muhammad)! Do not obey him (Abu Jahl).” [96:6-19]

6713,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6713,"The problem of a
    wife being left alone because the husband works long hours","is it wrong to keep your wife at home, not
      to let her leave the house on less she is with you ? 
      she will get bored ,,i work 15 hours a day 7 days a week ,,i get one day off every three
      weeks if im lucky.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Undoubtedly the temptations in this life are many, and the ways in which
        the Shaytaan deceives the sons of Adam are many and varied. So the husband has to take
        precautions. Allaah has entrusted him with an important task, which is to take care of his
        wife and children; He has made him responsible for educating and protecting them. The
        Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Each of you is a shepherd
        and each of you is responsible for his flock… a man is the shepherd of his family and
        is responsible for those under his care; a woman is the shepherd in her husband’s
        house and she is responsible for her those under her care.” (Narrated by
        al-Bukhaari, 893)
      
      
      The wife is a human of flesh and blood, and is affected by what she sees
        and hears from the people of evil and fitnah (temptation). So the husband should take this
        into account, so he can protect her from bad influences and stop her from going to bad
        places.
The Muslim husband should not live only for worldly purposes and work
        like a dumb machine. Wealth is tempting, but that which is with Allaah is better and more
        lasting. He should try to find work with shorter hours, even if the pay is less, as long
        as it is sufficient to meet his needs. This will give him more time to take care of his
        family and educate his children.
It is not right to leave his wife alone for this length of time, unless
        there is something to compensate the wife for the absence of her husband, such as studying
        sharee’ah or meeting with people who fear Allaah and can teach her something good,
        and so on. But if she is just being left alone, or is being left with the TV and its bad
        shows, or with bad neighbours and evil companions, then this is neglect and is to be
        condemned. Those who are neglectful often get their punishment in this world, before they
        even meet their Lord.
With regard to a woman going out of her house, according to
        sharee’ah it is not conditional upon her being accompanied by her husband or mahram
        as long as she is trustworthy and she goes to places where there is no fear for her, and
        the route she takes is safe. The presence of a mahram is a condition when she is
        travelling, but she does not have to be accompanied by a mahram everywhere she goes in the
        city – unless there is some evil or fitnah (temptation, tribulation) involved in her
        going even a short distance, in which case a woman should not go out on her own. Then it
        is better to be on the safe side and not go out unless she is with her husband or someone
        who can protect her and take care of her.
When a Muslim lives in a kaafir country, he has to make extra efforts to
        protect his family, such as getting together with other Muslim families and renting an
        apartment building together, or moving to live next to one another, so that this will
        offer a kind of protection and create a good environment for families and children. At the
        same time, the Muslim woman should find good, righteous women with whom she can fill her
        time when her husband is absent.

6714,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6714,Is it permissible    to perform ruqyah for a sick person who is a kaafir?,"I would like to know if it is permissible to perform ruqyah on a non-muslim person as a form of da'wah, that is if it gives good results, the person may start to be interested in islam and later convert? Of course, that person would be informed that there is no power in the ruqyah itself , but that whatever happens is up to Allah's will.",,,"Praise be to Allah.There is no reason why one cannot do this. Allah has created healing in the Quraan, as He has created healing in honey and oil and other things. These are means of healing and Allah is the Healer, so there is nothing wrong with performing ruqyah for this person, especially since you hope that this kaafir may become a Muslim.
There is also a report in a saheeh hadith that supports that idea that it is permissible to perform ruqyah for a non-Muslim. Abu Saeed (may Allah be pleased with him) said:
A group of the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) set out on a journey and travelled until they made came near one of the Arab tribes. (These people were either kaafirs or very stingy, as Ibn al-Qayyim mentioned in al-Madaarij). They asked them for hospitality but they refused to do so. Then the leader of that tribe was stung, and they tried everything but nothing helped him. Then some of them said, Why dont you go to those people who are staying (nearby)? Maybe some of them have something. So they went to them and said, O people, our leader has been stung and we have tried everything and nothing helped him. Do any of you have something? One of them said, Yes, by Allah. I will perform ruqyah for him, but by Allah we asked you for hospitality and you did not give us anything, so we will not perform ruqyah for you unless you give us something in return. So they agreed on a flock of sheep, then he started to blow on him and recite Al-hamdu Lillaahi Rabb il-Aalameen. Then he recovered quickly from his complaint and started walking, and there was nothing wrong with him. Then they have them what they had agreed to, and some of them (the Sahaabah) said, Let us share it out. The one who had performed ruqyah said, Do not do anything until we come to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and tell him what happened, and we will wait and see what he tells us to do. So they came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and told him what had happened. He said, How did you know that it is a ruqyah? Then he said, You did the right thing. Share them out, and give me a share. And the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) smiled. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2276, and by Muslim, 2201).
There follow some quotes from the commentary of Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) on the hadith and some additional details.
They asked them for hospitality means they asked them to regard them as guests. According to the report of Al-Amash narrated by scholars others than al-Tirmidhi, it says: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sent thirty of us and we camped near some people and asked them for a hospitable reception.
was stung means, he was stung by a scorpion.
and they tried everything means, they tried every kind of treatment that they usually did to treat him for the scorpion sting, they made the utmost effort to find the right treatment for him.
So they went to them. In the hadith of Jaabir, al-Bazzaar added: And said to them, We have heard that your companion has come with light and healing. They said, Yes.
Do any of you have something? Abu Dawood added in his report: that could help our companion.
One of them said According to the report of Abu Dawood: A man among the people said, Yes, I will perform ruqyah. The one who said this was Abu Saeed, the narrator of the report. His wording was: I said, Yes, I (have something). But I will not perform ruqyah for him until you give us some sheep.
This also appears in the report of Sulaymaan ibn Qattah, with the words: I came to him and performed ruqyah for him by reciting the Opening of the Book [Al-Faatihah].
So they agreed means, they reached an agreement
on a flock of sheep according to the report of al-Amash: They said, we will give you thirty ewes.
then he started to blow on him means, he blew or spat lightly on him, with little saliva.
Ibn Abi Hamzah said: the blowing in ruqyah should come after the recitation, so as to carry the barakah (blessing) of the recitation to the parts of the body over which the saliva passes, so that the barakah travels in his saliva when he blows.
recite Al-hamdu Lillaahi Rabb il-Aalameen According to the report of Shubah: He started to recite the Opening of the Book over him. According to the report of Al-Amash, he recited it seven times.
Then he recovered quickly. The meaning of nashata (translated here as recovered) is: he got up quickly. From the same root comes the expression rajul nasheet, meaning an active and energetic man.
from his complaint The word iqaal (translated here as complaint) could refer to the rope used to tie the foreleg of an animal.
and there was nothing wrong with him means, his problem was gone. A problem may be described as qalabah (wa maa bihi min qalabah translated here as and there was nothing wrong with him) because the one who is suffering from the problem may be turned (yuqallab) this way and that in order to find out where the problem is coming from.
How did you know that it is a ruqyah? Al-Daawoodi said: it means, what told you ? In the report of Mabad ibn Seereen it says: And what told him? This is something which is said to express astonishment and also admiration of a thing, which is quite appropritae in this case. Shubah added in his report: And it was not mentioned that he i.e., the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) disapproved of it. Sulaymaan ibn Qattah added in his report, after the phrase How did you know that it is a ruqyah?, I said: it came to me like an inspiration i.e., I was inspired to do it.
and give me a share means, give me some of them as if he wanted to be extra friendly towards them.
The hadith indicates that it is permissible to perform ruqyah by reciting the Book of Allah, and that it comes under the same category as dhikr and al-duaa al-mathoor (duaas reported in the Quraan and Sunnah), and also other duaas so long as they do not contradict what is in the Quraan and Sunnah.
The hadith also indicates that one may respond in kind to a person who does not treat one honourably, as the Sahaabah did by withholding the ruqyah from those people who had not shown them hospitality.
The hadith also indicates that in the absence of a specific text, one may make ijtihaad. It also demonstrates the esteem in which the Quraan was held in the hearts of the Sahaabah, especially Soorat al-Faatihah, and it shows that if provision (rizq) is decreed for someone, the person in whose hands it is cannot withhold it from him. Those people withheld their hospitality but Allah had decreed that the Sahaabah should have a share of their wealth, and they withheld it, so Allah caused the scorpion to sting their chief so that the Sahaabah would get what had been decreed for them. It also demonstrates the great wisdom of Allah in that the one who was singled out for punishment was their leader who had been foremost in withholding hospitality, because people usually follow the commands of their leaders. Since he has led them in withholding hospitality, he was singled out for the punishment whereas his people were not, which was a most fitting punishment.
In al-Mawsooah al-Fiqhiyyah it says:
There is no dispute among the fuqahaa concerning the fact that it is permissible for a Muslim to perform ruqyah for a kaafir. They take as evidence the hadith of Abu Saeed al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) which has been quoted above (f 14). Their evidence is that the tribe near whom they camped and from whom they sought hospitality were kuffaar, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not denounce that.

    he recite aloud or not?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on
    him) said : 
On the contrary, he should recite quietly, because when a person who
    joined the prayer late stands up to make up what he missed, he is then praying alone, so
    at that point he is subject to the rulings concerning one who prays alone. During the part
    of the (congregational) prayer he caught up with, he was subject to the rulings concerning
    one who prays in congregation behind an imaam. So he should do sujood (sajdat al-sahw
    – prostration of forgetfulness) if he forgets something in the part of the prayer
    that he is making up. Since this is the case, then the one who joined the prayer late
    should recite aloud where the person who prays individually should recite aloud. The
    scholars whose view is that the person who prays individually should recite aloud in
    Maghrib, ‘Ishaa’ and Fajr say that he should recite aloud if he is making up the
    first two rak’ahs. The scholars whose view is that the person who prays individually
    should not recite aloud say that the person who joined the prayer late should not recite
    aloud in this case. Nobody prays Jumu’ah individually, so no one can imagine that a
    person making up part of it individually has to recite aloud. The person who joined the
    prayer late is like the person who is praying individually, so he should not recite aloud.
    But the person who joins the Jumu’ah prayer late is considered to have prayed
    Jumu’ah in essence, because he followed the imaam, and different conditions apply to
    the one who follows than to the one who leads, with regard to numbers and so on. But the
    Sunnah states that a person who catches up with one rak’ah has caught up with the
    prayer, so he has caught up with Jumu’ah, just as a person who does one rak’ah
    of ‘Asr before the sun sets, or one rak’ah of Fajr before the sun rises, is

Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
And stay in your houses [Al-Ahzaab 33:33]
Based on this, the general principle is that women should stay at home and not go out except for essential reasons or cases of need. Islam states that a womans prayer at home is better for her than her prayer in the mosque even al-Masjid al-Haraam.
This does not mean that women have to remain prisoners in the house. Islam permits them to go to the mosque, and has made Hajj and Umrah, Eid prayers, etc. obligatory for them. Among the kinds of going out that are prescribed are her going to visit her family and mahrams, and going out to ask religious questions from people of knowledge. Women are also permitted to go out for their own needs, but all of this has to be within the limits and conditions set out in shareeah, such as being accompanied by a mahram when she travels, or being assured that her route is safe when she moves about in her own city or locality. She should also go out wearing complete hijaab, and she should not be wearing make-up, adornments or perfume.
A number of texts have been narrated concerning this, including the following:


Ibn Umar reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: If the wife of any one of you asks for permission to go to the mosque, do not stop her.


(Narrated by al-Bukhari, 827; Muslim, 442)
Zaynab, the wife of Abd-Allah, said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to us: If any one of you (women) comes to the mosque, let her not wear perfume.
(Narrated by Muslim, 443)
Jaabir ibn Abd-Allah said: my maternal aunt got divorced and wanted to go and pick some fruit from her trees. A man told her off for going out, so she went to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and he said, Never mind, go and pick the fruit from your trees. Maybe you will be able to give it in charity or do something good with it.
(Narrated by Muslim, 1483)
The entertainment referred to in the question may involve mixing or looking at strangers (non-mahram men), or travelling without a mahram, or many things that are of no benefit. So you have to be cautious and make sure that the entertainment really is permissible and halaal, and free of any haraam things that would earn the punishment of Allah. If a woman goes out to a place where there is nothing haraam going on and she does not go out too frequently, there is nothing wrong with this.

Those who participate say the deceased was a holy man and can basically pass on our Du'aas- coming from a holy person, it may be better accepted. If poss. can you shed some light?",,,"Praise be to Allah.1. Visits to graves fall into two categories:

(i) visits which are prescribed in Islam and are required for the purpose of making du'aa' for the dead, praying for mercy for them, remembering death and preparing oneself for the Hereafter. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""Visit the graves, for they remind you of the Hereafter."" (Narrated by Muslim, 976).
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to visit graves, as did his Companions, may Allaah be pleased with them.
It was reported that 'Aa'ishah said that when it was her night for the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to stay with her, he would go out during the latter part of the night to (the cemetery of) al-Baqee' and say, ""Peace be upon you, dwellings of the believing people. There has come to you that which you were promised, , and if Allaah wills we will follow you soon. O Allaah, forgive the people of Baqee' al-Gharqad."" (Narrated by Muslim, 974).

(ii) the second type is bid'ah (innovation), which is visiting graves for the purpose of calling upon their occupants, seeking their help, offering sacrifices to them and making vows to them. This is forbidden and is a major form of Shirk (shirk akbar). Connected to this is the practice of visiting graves to offer du'aa', perform salaah and read Qur'aan there. This is all bid'ah and is not prescribed in Islam.

2. With regard to praying (performing salaah) at a grave. If what is meant is Salaat al-janaazah (the funeral prayer), this is permissible and is not forbidden. But if what is meant is to perform fard or naafil prayers, this is forbidden and is haraam.

The evidence for the permissibility of praying Salaat al-Janaazah in the graveyard:

It was reported from Abu Hurayrah that a black man or a black woman who used to clean the mosque died. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) asked about him and they said, ""He died."" He said, ""Why did you not tell me? Show me his grave."" Or he said, ""her grave."" So he went to the grave and prayed for her. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 446; Muslim, 956).

The evidence that it is not permissible to offer any salaat other than janaazah in the graveyard:

(a) 'Aa'ishah and 'Abd-Allaah ibn 'Abbaas said: ""When (death) approached the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), he started to cover his face with a cloak of his. When he became distressed he lifted it from his face and said, ""May Allaah curse the Jews and the Christians, for they have taken the graves of their Prophets as places of worship."" [The narrator said:] he was warning against doing what they did."" (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 425; Muslim, 531).
(b) Abu Marthad al-Ghanawi said: the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""Do not sit on graves and do not pray facing them."" (Narrated by Muslim, 972).

3. With regard to the 'Urs which is held every year: if this involves some kinds of acts of worship, or if the people who attend think that this will bring them closer to Allaah, or if it involves acts of disobedience and sin, then it is not permissible to attend it or take part in it. Even if it is free of all these matters, you should still not attend it, because adopting an occasion as an ""Eid"" or festival (a regular annual event) other than the Eids precribed in Islam is bid'ah (reprehensible innovation) and is forbidden. The belief of those present, that the soul of the ""wali"" attends this 'Urs is an innovated and forbidden belief, because in the future this may be taken as being a part of the religion, and it will lead people astray. So this event must be denounced and people must be warned against it, and you should not attend it. And Allaah is the guide to the straight path.

4. With regard to asking a righteous person to make du'aa' for you when he is still alive - this is permissible, because there is the hope that his du'aa' may be answered because of his righteousness. The evidence for this is:
(a) It was reported from 'Uthmaan ibn Haneef (may Allaah be pleased with him) that a blind man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: ""Pray to Allaah to heal me."" He said, ""If you wish, I will pray for you, and if you wish, I will delay that, and that will be better."" (According to another report: ""If you wish, be patient - that will be better for you."") He said, ""Pray for me."" So he commanded him to do wudoo' and to do it well, and to pray two rak'ahs""
(Narrated by Ahmad, 4/138; al-Tirmidhi, 5/569; Ibn Maajah, 1/441; it is a saheeh hadeeth).
(b) It was reported that Anas said: whilst the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was giving the khutbah (sermon) on Friday, a man stood up and said, ""O Messenger of Allaah, the horses have died and the sheep have died. Pray to Allaah to give us rain."" So he spread his hands and prayed (made du'aa'). (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 890; Muslim, 897).

5. If a wali or Prophet dies, it is not correct, according to sharee'ah, to ask him to make du'aa' for you, because he has been cut off from this world. This is a kind of shirk which is not committed by any of the righteous people of this Ummah, the Sahaabah and those who follow them.
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
""And who is more astray than one who calls on (invokes) besides Allâh, such as will not answer him till the Day of Resurrection, and who are (even) unaware of their calls (invocations) to them? And when mankind are gathered (on the Day of Resurrection), they (false deities) will become their enemies and will deny their worshipping""
[al-Ahqaaf 46:5-6]
Shaykh Al-Islam (Ibn Taymiyah - may Allaah have mercy on him) said: To explain further: if what the person wants is something that none is able to do except Allaah - such as asking for healing from sickness, for people or animals, or for his debts to be paid off in some manner that he does not specify, or for his family to be safe and sound, or to be protected from calamity in this world or the next, or for help against his enemy, or for his heart to be guided, or for his sins to be forgiven, or for him to be admitted to Paradise or saved from Hell, or for help to learn knowledge and the Qur'aan, or for his heart to be reformed, his attitude to be made good, his soul to be purified and so on - all of these are things which it is not permissible to seek from anyone other than Allaah. It is not permissible to say to an angel or a Prophet or a shaykh, whether he is alive or dead, ""forgive my sin"" or ""help me against my enemy"" or ""heal my sick loved one"" or ""protect my family or my livestock"" and the like.
Whoever asks any created being - no matter who he is - for any of these things, is a mushrik who associates others with his Lord. He is like the mushrikeen who worship angels, Prophets and statues which they have created in their image, and his prayer is like the prayers of the Christians to the Messiah and his mother. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
""And (remember) when Allaah will say (on the Day of Resurrection): ""O 'Eesaa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary)! Did you say unto men: 'Worship me and my mother as two gods besides Allaah?' "" He will say: ""Glory be to You! It was not for me to say what I had no right (to say)."" [al-Maa'idah 5:116]
""They (Jews and Christians) took their rabbis and their monks to be their lords besides Allaah (by obeying them in things which they made lawful or unlawful according to their own desires without being ordered by Allaah), and (they also took as their Lord) Messiah, son of Maryam (Mary), while they (Jews and Christians) were commanded [in the Tawraat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] to worship none but One Ilaah (God - Allaah) Laa ilaaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He). Praise and glory be to Him (far above is He) from having the partners they associate (with Him)."" [al-Tawbah 9:31]
(Majmoo' al-Fataawaa, 27/ 67, 68).

And he [Ibn Taymiyah] said:

Whoever comes to the grave of a Prophet or a righteous man, or what he believes to be the grave of a Prophet or a righteous man although it is not, and asks him for something and seeks his help, one of the three following scenarios applies:

(i) he is asking him for something that he needs, such as to cure his sick animals or to pay off his debt or to take revenge on his enemy or to protect him, his family and his livestock, and other things which no one can do except Allaah. This is obvious shirk and he must be told to repent. If he repents, all well and good, otherwise he must be executed.
If he says, I am asking him because he is closer to Allaah, so that he can intercede for me with regard to these matters, because I am seeking Allaah's help through his virtue, just as people seek the ruler's help through those who are close to him - this is also like the actions of the mushrikeen and Christians, who claim that they take their priests and monks as intercessors and ask them to intercede for them with their requests. Allaah tells us that the mushrikeen say:
"" 'We worship them only that they may bring us near to Allaah.'"" [al-Zumar 39:3 - interpretation of the meaning].
And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
""Have they taken (others) as intercessors besides Allaah? Say: ""Even if they have power over nothing whatever and have no intelligence?"" Say: ""To Allaah belongs all intercession. His is the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth. Then to Him you shall be brought back."" [al-Zumar 39:43-44]
""You (mankind) have none, besides Him, as a Wali (protector or helper) or an intercessor. Will you not then remember (or receive admonition)?"" [al-Sajdah 32:4]
""Who is he that can intercede with Him except with His Permission?"" [al-Baqarah 2:255].

The difference between Him and His creation is clear: people usually ask some of their leading figures who are in positions of honour to intercede for them with their leaders, so that intercessor asks the leader and he meets the person's request because he hopes to gain something thereby, or because he is afraid of him, or because he is too shy to refuse, or because he is being friendly towards him, etc. But no one intercedes with Allaah, may He be glorified, until He gives permission to the intercessor. He only does what He wills, and the intercession of the intercessor is only made by His permission. The entire matter rests with Him The idea of many misguided people, that this person is closer to Allaah than I am, and I am far away from Allaah and cannot call upon Him except through this mediation etc., all of these ideas are ideas of shirk. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
""And when My slaves ask you (O Muhammad ) concerning Me, then (answer them), I am indeed near (to them by My Knowledge). I respond to the invocations of the supplicant when he calls on Me (without any mediator or intercessor)"" [al-Baqarah 2:186]

In al-Saheeh it was reported that when they were on a journey, they were saying Takbeer (""Allaahu akbar"") in loud voices, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
""O people, take it easy! You are not calling upon One Who is deaf or absent; you are calling upon One Who is All-Hearing and Ever Near. The One upon Whom you are calling is closer to any one of you than the neck of his camel.""

Allaah has commanded all people to pray to Him and call on Him, and He has commanded them all to say (interpretation of the meaning):
""You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything)."" [al-Faatihah 1:5].

And He has told us that the Mushrikeen say:
"" 'We worship them only that they may bring us near to Allaah.'"" [al-Zumar 39:3 - interpretation of the meaning].

Moreover, it may be said to this mushrik: if you call upon this person, that means you think that he knows more about your situation, is more able to grant you what you ask for and is more merciful towards you. This is ignorance, misguidance and kufr. If you know that Allaah has more knowledge and is more able and more merciful, then why do you fail to ask Him, and instead turn to others? Have you not heard what al-Bukhaari and others narrated from Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him), who said: the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to teach us to pray Istikhaarah (du'aa' seeking guidance from Allaah) in all our affairs, just as he taught us the Surahs of the Qur'aan.

Even if you know that this person is closer to Allaah than you and of a higher status than you, this may be true, but what you are implying is wrong. Even if he is indeed closer to Allaah and of a higher status, that only means that Allaah will reward him and give him more than you. It does not mean that if you call on him, Allaah will answer your prayer more than He would do if you called upon Him yourself. If you are deserving of being punished and of having your supplication rejected, for example, because your du'aa' is offered in an improper manner, then no Prophet or righteous person will help you to do something that Allaah dislikes and is angry with. Even if that is not the case, then you should ask from Allaah because Allaah is more merciful.

6745,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6745,Sufi formulas andbid’ah,"In your 'Innovations' sections, you say it's bidah to recite, say a 100 times or something, suras hoping for reward. After reading a Sufi book by Hakim Moinuddin Chishti called 'Sufi Healing"", I saw that it justified using such formulas by saying that the formulas and other things had been inspired by Allah through dreams or etc. to certain Muslims who were very close to Allah. Would this make it a part of Shariah? How can we know that they are being truthful? Is this acceptable in Islam?",,,"Praise be to Allah.1. Allah described His awliyaa (close friends) as having two characteristics: Eemaan (faith) and Taqwa (piety, awareness of Allah). Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
No doubt! Verily, the Awliyaa of Allah [i.e., those who believe in the Oneness of Allah and fear Allah much and love Allah much], nor fear shall be upon them nor shall they grieve, - those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah) and used to fear Allah much [Yoonus 10:62-63]
2. The true awliyaa of Allah do not go against what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) brought. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) warned against innovated matters in religion, because Allah has perfected His religion and completed His favour upon His slaves. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion [al-Maaidah 5:3].
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Whoever innovates something in this matter of ours [i.e., Islam] that is not a part of it, will have it rejected.
3. Therefore one can distinguish between the walee (close friend) of Allah and the walee of the Shaytaan, by looking at the persons character, behaviour and religious commitment does he pray regularly in jamaaah in the mosque, for example? Does he avoid wrongfully consuming peoples property? Does he avoid going against Islam by either adding or taking away anything? And so on
4. It is not permissible for a Muslim to innovate any dhikr to recite regularly or to tell others to do so such as awraad/wird, mathooraat or duaas. The adhkaar that were reported in the saheeh Sunnah are sufficient for this, otherwise a person is an innovator or one who calls others to bidah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Whoever innovates something in this matter of ours [i.e., Islam] that is not a part of it, will have it rejected.
(Narrated by Al-Bukhaari, 2550; Muslim, 1718). According to a report narrated by Muslim: Whoever does any action that is not in accordance with this matter of ours (i.e., Islam) will have it rejected.
Ibn Rajab Al-Hanbali (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
This hadeeth represents one of the most important principles in Islam. It is like a scale against which the external appearances of deeds are measured, just as the hadeeth Actions are but by intention is the scale against which the inner motivations of actions are measured. Just as every deed which is not done for the sake of Allah will bring no reward for the one who does it, so also every deed which is not in accordance with the way of Allah and His Messenger will be rejected and thrown back at the one who does it. Anyone who innovates new things in the religion and does things for which Allah and His Messenger have not granted permission, this is not a part of the religion at all.
(Jaami al-Uloom wal-Hukam, 1/180).
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
This hadeeth is one of the most important basic principles of Islam, and it is one of the most concise and comprehensive sayings of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). It clearly states that innovations and newly invented matters will be rejected. The second report adds another idea, which is that some of those who follow the innovations of others may become stubborn when they are presented with the evidence of the first report which says, Whoever innovates something They may say, I am not innovating anything. But he may in this case be presented with the evidence of the second report, which says, ""Whoever does any action""... This clearly shows that all innovated actions will be rejected, whether the one who does them innovates them himself or is following someone else who innovated it This hadeeth is one that should be learned by heart and used to denounce evil actions and be spread as evidence so that all people may use it.
(Sharh Muslim, 12/16).
5. Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah] (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
No doubt adhkaar and duaas are among the best forms of worship, and worship is one of the matters in which there is no room for personal opinions we have to follow what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did and taught, not our own whims and desires or innovations. The duaas and adhkaar of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) are the best that anyone could find. The one who follows this way will be safe and sound, and the benefits and positive results that he will gain are beyond description. Any other duaas and adhkaar may be haraam or they may be makrooh; they may involve shirk even though most people do not realize that the details of this would take too long to explain here.
No one has the right to teach the people any kinds of duaas or adhkaar apart from those that are mentioned in the Sunnah, or to make it a kind of regular worship which he expects the people to do regularly as they do the five daily prayers this is the innovation in religion which Allah does not allow As for adopting a wird or regularly reciting a dhikr that is not prescribed in shareeah, this is one of the things that is not allowed. The duaas and adhkaar prescribed by shareeah are the best that anyone could ever hope to find, and no one ignores them in favour of newly-invented, innovated adhkaar except one who is ignorant, negligent or a wrongdoer.

“a creature who is brought up in adornments (wearing silk and gold ornaments, i.e. women), and who in dispute cannot make herself clear” [al-Zukhruf 43:18]
The adornments in which the female is brought up include gold, silver and precious stones. 
Allah has blessed mankind and the jinn with the things that come out of the sea and rivers such as pearls and coral. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):

 Diamonds and other kinds of precious stones are among the adornments which women are permitted to wear, but this adornment should not be shown to “strangers” (i.e., non-mahrams).

But the scholars said that if a man habitually does this, his wife has the right to ask for a divorce. The wife has to resist this evil action and remind her husband about Allah and about the punishment for transgressing the limits set by Allah.",,"Praise be to Allah.Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Your wives are a tilth for you, so go to your tilth (Have sexual relations with your wives in any manner as long as it is in the vagina and not in the anus ), when or how you will, and send (good deeds, or ask Allah to bestow upon you pious offspring) for your ownselves beforehand. And fear Allah, and know that you are to meet Him (in the Hereafter), and give good tidings to the believers (O Muhammad).” [Al-Baqarah 2:223]
From the word Harth (tilth) we understand that what is permissible is only in the vagina (the front passage), especially because this is what will produce children. The semen that is planted in the womb from which offspring come is likened to the seeds which are planted in the ground, from which vegetation comes, as both of them are substances from which something else is produced.
The phrase translated as when or how you will means, in any manner you wish, from behind or from the front, sitting or with the wife lying on her back or on her side, so long as it is in the place of tilth (i.e., the vagina, the place from which a baby is born).
The poet said:
The wombs are lands for us to till; we have to plant the seeds and whatever grows is up to Allah.
It was reported from Khuzaymah ibn Thabit (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah is not too shy to tell you the truth: do not have intercourse with your wives in the anus .” (Narrated by Imam Ahmad, 5/213; a good Hadith)
Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah will not look at a man who has intercourse with his wife in her anus .” (Narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah, 3/529; narrated and classed as authentic by At-Tirmidhi, 1165) (See Nayl Al-Maram by Siddiq Hasan Khan, 1/151-154)
If a man does this, his wife is not considered to be divorced as many people think, because there is no Shar`i evidence at all that indicates this. But the scholars said that if a man habitually does this, his wife has the right to ask for a divorce, because he is an evildoer who is causing harm by his action, and also because the purpose of marriage cannot be achieved through this action. The wife has to resist this evil action and remind her husband about Allah and about the punishment for transgressing the limits set by Allah. If the husband repents to Allah from this deed, there is no reason why she should not stay with him, and there is no need to renew the marriage contract.
