13901,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13901,It is not permissible to waive a debt and count that as zakah,"About three years ago one of my friends came to Dubai in search of job. He requested me to pay for his visa, medical and other expenses which amounted nearly Dhs. 4500/= (four thousand five hundred Dirhams) i.e. about 1200/= u.s.dollars. Due to some reasons he could adjust himself to the new country and returned back to India promising me to return to me the amount Dhs. 4500/= which I had spent for him. After one year he could only return Dhs. 1000/= (one thousand Dirhams only). Thereafter, I persistently demanded to return to me the balance amount Dhs. 3500/= (about USD 900) which he never returned. During my last visit to my hometown two months back, he sent message to me that his financial condition was not good and he was not in a position to return the balance amount under any circumstances. He also requested me to waive the due amount Dhs. 3500/= as ZAKAAT.
My question is ; CAN I WAIVE THE AMOUNT DHS. 3500/= AS ZAKAAT ( CONSIDERING AS ZAKAAT GIVEN TO THIS MY FRIEND )FROM THE ZAKAAT AMOUNT WHICH I HAVE TO TAKE OUT DURING THIS HOLY MONTH OF RAMADAN ? CAN I DEDUCT THIS AMOUNT FROM THE TOTAL ZAKAAT AMOUNT WHICH I HAVE TO GIVE TO THE POORS THIS RAMADAN ?",,,"Praise be to Allah.It was narrated in al-Saheehayn from ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to Mu’aadh ibn Jabal, when he sent him to Yemen: “Teach them that Allah has enjoined upon them zakah on their wealth, to be taken from their rich and given to their poor.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained that zakah is something which is to be taken and given, so on this basis it is not permissible to let off someone who owes you money and count that as zakah, because letting someone off a debt does not involve taking and giving. 
Shaykh al-Islam mentioned this issue and said: letting someone off a debt does not relieve one of the obligation of zakah, and there is no scholarly dispute on this matter. But you can give this needy person some of your zakah and he can meet his needs using what you give him as zakah; and Allah will help him to pay off his debt in the future, in sha Allah.","Fataawa Manaar al-Islam by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him), vol. 1, p. 309-310"

13918,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13918,Speaking to one’s fiancée over the phone when fasting,can one be fasting and be talking to her fiancé over the phone?,,,"Praise be to Allah.There are guidelines that have to do with speaking to one’s fiancée, details of which may be found in Question no. 13791. 
If these guidelines are met, especially the stipulation that there be no risk of provoking desire and if there is a need to speak to her, then it is permissible. But if any of these guidelines is not met then talking to her becomes something that is not allowed according to sharee’ah. If you talk to her and one of these guidelines is not met whilst you are fasting, this is going to affect your fast. In this case it is worse and a more serious sin, because it is happening at a time of virtue, and because the one who is fasting has to protect his fast from anything that may spoil it or affect it.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
13921,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13921,A Fabricated Hadeeth,"One day in our mosque, a person who claims to have knowledge gave a speech after leading us in Thuhr prayer. He told us that when Khadeejah, the wife of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), died, he slaughtered a camel for her and mourned for her for three days. He said that this was narrated in the hadeeth (narration) of Qatadah. Then he quoted another hadeeth but refused to say who narrated it. He said that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I am a tree, ‘Ali is its trunk, Fatimah is its branches and al-Hasan and al-Husayn are its fruits.” Then he narrated a third hadeeth in which he said that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) encountered a Jewish man one day on one of the mountains of Makkah. He said to him, “Will you not believe in me?” The Jew said: “No, I do not believe in you.” He said to him, ‘Call this tree.” He said to it, “Muhammad is calling you.” So the tree came and lowered its branches towards him, dragging its roots. He said to it, “Who am I?” It said, “You are Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah.” The Jew uttered the Shahadatayn (testimony of faith) after that, then the tree ascended to heaven and circumambulated the Throne, the Kursiy (Footstool), al-Lawh al-Mahfooz and the Pen, and it asked Allah for permission to send blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and he said, “O Jew, kiss the hands and feet of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).” Then he told another story, in which he said that ‘Uthman ibn ‘Affan (may Allah be pleased with him) saw a man circumambulating the Ka’abah and said to him, “You are an adulterer.” He said, “How do you know that?” He said, “I knew it from your eyes.” The man said: “I did not commit adultery but I looked at a Jewish woman.” The man said to ‘Uthman ibn ‘Affan, “Did you know that through revelation (wahy)?” He said, “No, but it is the insight of the believer.” When (this preacher) was asked for evidence, his supporters were about to attack us. We hope you can give us a shar’i opinion on this.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The stories which this preacher told are all false and are 
    lies against the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that 
    have no basis. He did not mourn after the death of Khadeejah (may Allah be 
    pleased with her), or slaughter a camel, or invite the people to mourn, as 
    some people do nowadays. He used to make a lot of du’a (supplication) for 
    Khadeejah (may Allah be pleased with her), and sometimes he would slaughter 
    a sheep and distribute the meat among her friends as a gift and act of 
    kindness, and he would pray for her and be kind to her by means of this 
    du’a.

    Similarly, what he said about the tree is also false and has 
    no basis, and what he said about the Jew is all lies, like the lies made up 
    by the evil fabricators. The same applies to what he narrated about ‘Uthman 
    (may Allah be pleased with him) and that man. Moreover Qatadah was not a 
    Sahabi (Companion of the Prophet), rather he was a Tabi’i (Successor). 

    The point is that these four reports are all false and are 
    not sound at all, But it was narrated in other, saheeh hadeeths (authentic 
    narrations) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) 
    called some trees and they came to him– and that was one of the signs of 
    Prophethood. This story was proven in Saheeh Muslim, where it says that on 
    one of his journeys he wanted to relieve himself, so he called two trees and 
    they came together, and he sat between them to relieve himself, then each 
    tree went back to its place. This was a sign from Allah that was evidence of 
    His almighty power, and that he says to a thing “Be!” and it is. This was 
    also a sign of the truth of the Messenger of Allah and that he was indeed 
    the Messenger of Allah. This is something other than the story that this 
    liar told. We must beware of these liars, and the preacher must fear Allah 
    when he preaches to people; he should remind them of things that will 
    benefit them in their spiritual and worldly affairs of verses of the Quran 
    and saheeh hadeeths from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon 
    him). That is sufficient. It was narrated in a saheeh hadeeth that the 
    Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever 
    narrates a hadeeth from me knowing that it is false, he is one of the 
    liars.” (Narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh). And he (peace and blessings of 
    Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever narrated from me something that I did not 
    say, let him take his place in Hell.” (Saheeh, agreed upon). And there are 
    many similar hadeeths.","Majmoo’ Fatawa wa Maqalat li’l-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 6/357"

But with regard to your mother-in-law’s claims that you have to seek her approval in all matters, this is not correct, and none of the scholars has said that this is one of the rights that a husband has over his wife. Rather your duties are those which have been mentioned (by the scholars), namely obeying your husband and seeking his approval, so long as he does not tell you to commit a sin. That does not mean that you should not benefit from your mother-in-law’s experience or her advice if it is useful. And if you are patient in putting up with some of her difficult behaviour in order to honour your husband, that is a good deed for which you will be rewarded in sha Allah. But as for her saying that your family have no rights over you, this is not correct, rather they still have the rights of upholding ties with them, honouring them, treating them kindly and visiting them from time to time, especially your parents.

I got married one year ago with my brother as my guardian, because my father refused to marry me. After one year, my father had happily accepted my marriage. I am sometimes worried about the validity of my nikah, was it islamically correct?",,,"Praise be to Allah.(1)This advice is addressed to parents:  
The 
          duty of parents is to hasten to arrange the marriages of the women who 
          are under their guardianship, if someone who is compatible proposes 
          marriage and the woman agrees to that. Whoever does not do that is going 
          against the command of the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). It was narrated from Abu 
          Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If there comes a 
          proposal of marriage from one with whose religious commitment and character 
          you are pleased, then marry [your female relative under your guardianship] 
          to him, for if you do not do that, there will be fitnah (temptation, 
          tribulation) on earth and much corruption.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 
          al-Nikaah, 1004; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh 
          Sunan al-Tirmidhi, no. 865).
It 
          is not permissible to treat them with harshness [cf. al-Nisaa’ 4:19 
          – interpretation of the meaning] for any reason that has not been prescribed 
          by Allaah and His Messenger. “Harsh treatment”, as defined by Ibn Qudaamah, 
          means, “preventing a woman from getting married to someone who is compatible, 
          if she asks for that and if each of them wants to marry the other.” 
          (See al-Mughni, part 7, p. 24). Parents and guardians should 
          hasten to marry the women under their care because that will protect 
          them from falling into that which Allaah has forbidden, and so that 
          the guardian himself will not fall into that which Allaah has forbidden 
          of the sin of treating them harshly. The basic principle is that harsh 
          treatment on the part of the guardian by not letting her marry someone 
          compatible is haraam, because it is oppression and harming the woman 
          by depriving her of her right to marry someone she wants. That is because 
          Allaah forbade that when He said, addressing guardians: 
“… 
          do not prevent them from marrying their (former) husbands…” [al-Baqarah 
          2:232 – interpretation of the meaning].
(2)The ruling on this matter may be one of two:  
The 
          first is that if the closest relative or guardian of the woman was treating 
          her harshly by preventing her from getting married, then it is OK for 
          a more distant  relative to act as her guardian in marriage, even 
          if the closer relative is present, because in this case he has no right 
          to be her guardian.  
Al-Mirdaawi said: “The phrase ‘if the 
          closer relative is preventing her from getting married then the more 
          distant relative should act as her guardian in marriage’ is the correct 
          view in the madhhab; most of our companions share this view… Shaykh 
          Taqiy al-Deen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: one of the forms 
          of ‘harsh treatment’ is when no one is proposing marriage to her, because 
          of the harshness of her guardian.”
(al-Insaaf, 
          part 5, p. 74)
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: If 
          she likes a man and he is compatible with her, then it is obligatory 
          for her brother or her (paternal) uncle to act as her guardian in her 
          marriage to him. If they treat her harshly and prevents her from marrying, 
          then a more-distantly related guardian may marry her to him.”
(al-Fataawa 
          al-Kubra, part 3, p. 83)
Ibn Qudaamah said: “If her more-closely related guardian 
          treats her harshly (by not letting her get married), then the guardianship 
          passes to one who is more distantly related. This was stated by Ahmad…”
(al-Mughni 
          by Ibn Qudaamah, part 7, p. 24)
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: If a father prevents his 
          daughter from marrying someone who is compatible, then guardianship 
          passes to a more distant relative, the closest then the closest.”
(Fataawa 
          Islamiyyah, part 3, p. 149)
The 
          second is when a more distant relative has arranged the marriage when 
          the closer relative is present and was not treating her harshly (by 
          preventing her from getting married).
Al-Mardaawi 
          said: “If a more distant relative arranged the marriage for no reason, 
          or a non-relative arranged the marriage, then this is not valid.” (al-Insaaf, 
          part 8, p. 82).
Al-Bahooti 
          said: “If a more distant relative arranged the marriage with no reason 
          why a closer relative could not have arranged it, then the marriage 
          is not valid… because the more distant relative has no right of guardianship 
          if a closer relative is present.”
(Kashshaaf 
          al-Qinaa’, part 5, p. 56)
This issue may be examined further. If 
          the closer relative approves of this marriage, what is the ruling? And 
          if the closer relative approves of this marriage, does his approval 
          make the marriage valid or not?
The 
          scholars said: If someone arranges the marriage when there is someone 
          else who is more entitled to guardianship and he is present, and is 
          not treating her harshly (by preventing her from getting married), then 
          the marriage is invalid. This issue includes three rulings, the first 
          of which is that if the more distantly related guardian arranges the 
          marriage, when the more closely related guardian is present, and she 
          accepts the proposal of marriage without the permission of the closer 
          relative, then it is not valid.
This 
          was the view of al-Shaafa’i.
Maalik 
          said: It is valid, because this is a guardian, so it is permissible 
          for him to arrange the marriage with her permission, as is the case 
          with a closer relative. 
The 
          second ruling is that this marriage is null and void; it was not done 
          with permission or with proper permission, and it cannot be made valid 
          with the approval of the closer relative. Marriage in all such cases 
          is invalid, according to the more sound of the two reports. This was 
          stated by Ahmad in several places, and this is the view of al-Shaafa’i, 
          Abu ‘Ubayd and Abu Thawr.
Another 
          report was narrated from Ahmad, in which he said that it depended on 
          approval, if approval was given it was permissible, and if approval 
          were not given, it was invalid.
Inkaah 
          al-Fudooli.
According 
          to the terminology of the fuqaha’, the fudooli means one who 
          interferes in the rights of another without any permission from sharee’ah, 
          because his interfering is not based on any rights of ownership, trusteeship 
          or guardianship.
(al-Mawsoo’ah 
          al-Fiqhiyyah, part 32, p. 171)
The 
          fuqaha’ differed concerning the ruling on a marriage arranged by a fudooli 
          without any rights of guardianship or proxy:
The 
          Hanbalis and al-Shaafa’i in al-Jadeed said that the marriage 
          arranged by a fudooli is invalid and the approval of the guardian has 
          no effect (i.e., the marriage contract must be repeated).
The second view is that of Ahmad, according 
          to one report narrated from him, and of Abu Yoosuf, which is that the 
          marriage arranged by a fudooli is valid, but it depends on the approval 
          of the guardian. If he gives approval then it is OK, but if he disapproves, 
          it is not valid.
(al-Mawsoo’ah 
          al-Fiqhiyyah, part 32, p. 175)
In 
          conclusion: some of the scholars have said that the marriage contract 
          is valid if the guardian approves – as you have seen – and if you want 
          to have more peace of mind and avoid an area concerning which there 
          are differences of opinion among the scholars, then do the marriage 
          contract again. All that is needed is the proposal from your guardian 
          – your father – and acceptance from the husband, and the witness of 
          two Muslim men, and repentance for what has happened.

13930,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13930,Meaning of the hadeeth “No haamah and no Safar and no naw’ and no ghoul”,"I read a strange hadeeth which says that there is no haamah, no Safar, no naw’ and no ghoul. What do these words mean?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Ibn Muflih al-Hanbali said:  
In 
          al-Musnad, al-Saheehayn and elsewhere it is narrated that 
          the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No haamah and no 
          Safar.” Muslim and others add the words, “No naw’ and no ghoul.”  
          
Haamah 
          (pl. Haam) [owl]: the people of the jaahiliyyah used to think that when 
          someone died and was buried, an owl [haamah] would come out of his grave. 
          The Arabs used to think that the bones of the deceased turned into owls 
          which flew, and they said that if someone was murdered, an owl would 
          come out of his head, and it would keep saying, “Give me to drink, give 
          me to drink,” until the slain person was avenged and his killer was 
          killed.  
Safar: 
          it was said that they used to have superstitions concerning the month 
          of Safar, so the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No Safar”. And it 
          was said that the Arabs used to believe that there was a snake in the 
          stomach which would harm a person when he had intercourse, and that 
          this was contagious, so the Lawgiver denied that. Maalik said: the people 
          of the Jaahiliyyah would regard Safar as not being sacred one year and 
          as sacred the next year.  
Naw’: (pl. al-Anwaa’) (a 
          star which sets at the rising of another): this refers to twenty eight 
          lunar mansions or phases, as in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):  
          
“And 
          the moon, We have measured for it mansions…” 
[Yaa-Seen 
          36:39].   
Every 
          thirteen nights, one of these stars sets in the west at dawn, and another 
          rises in the east, so that at the end of the year they will all have 
          come and gone. The Arabs used to believe that when one set and the next 
          one rose, there would be rain, which they attributed to them (these 
          stars), so they would say, “We have rain because of such and such naw’ 
          (star which sets at the rising of another).”  
It is called naw’ because 
          when the star which is setting sets in the west, the one which is rising 
          appears (naa’a) in the east, i.e., it rises and emerges. And it was 
          said that naw’ means setting, which is the opposite.  
But 
          in the case of those who believe that rain came by the will of Allaah 
          and say, “We have rain at the time of such and such naw’” meaning that 
          Allaah usually causes rain to come at this time – there is some dispute 
          as to whether saying this is haraam or makrooh.  
Ghoul (pl. gheelaan) means 
          a kind of jinn or devil. The Arabs used to think that the ghoul lived 
          in the wilderness and would appear to people, and that it could take 
          on different shapes and colours, and that it would make them lose their 
          way, seeking to kill them. The Lawgiver rejected and denied this idea 
          altogether.  
And it was said that this 
          was not denying that ghouls exist, rather it was a denial of the Arabs’ 
          belief that they could change shape and colour and make people lose 
          their way, hence the meaning of “no ghoul” is that they cannot make 
          people lose their way. This is borne out by another hadeeth, “There 
          is no ghoul but there is sa’aali” This is in Muslim and elsewhere. Sa’aali 
          is a magician among the jinn, but among them there are magicians who 
          base their magic on confusion and illusions… al-Khallaal narrated from 
          Taawoos that a man accompanied him, then a crow cawed and the man said, 
          “Good, good.” Taawoos said to him, “What good is there in this, and 
          what evil? Do not come with me!”  
(al-Aadaab 
          al-Shar’iyyah, 3/369, 370)  
Ibn 
          al-Qayyim said:  
Some 
          scholars said that the words “no healthy person should be exposed to 
          a sick person” were abrogated by the words “There is no ‘adwa 
          (contagion).” This is not correct. This is an example where what is 
          negated is different than what is affirmed. What the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) denied when he said “There 
          is no contagion and no Safar” was the belief of the mushrikeen 
          which was based on their beliefs of shirk. With regard to the 
          Prophet’s prohibition of exposing healthy people to sick people, there 
          are two interpretations:  
(1) The fear that 
          people may attribute what Allaah has decreed to ‘adwa (contagion), 
          which may confuse those who hear of this and make them believe in ‘adwa. 
          There is no contradiction between the two reports.
(2) That this refers to exposing the sick person to 
          the healthy person, which may be the means by which Allaah creates disease, 
          so the exposure is the cause, but Allaah may divert its effects by means 
          of other causes which oppose it or prevent the effect of the sickness. 
          This is pure Tawheed, unlike that which the people of shirk believe 
          in.  
This is similar to the 
          denial of intercession on the Day of Resurrection mentioned in the aayah 
          (interpretation of the meaning):  
“when 
          there will be no bargaining, nor friendship, nor intercession” 
[al-Baqarah 
          2:254]  
This 
          does not contradict the unambiguous mutawaatir ahaadeeth which say that 
          there will be intercession on the Day of Resurrection, because what 
          Allaah is denying here is the kind of intercession that was known among 
          the mushrikeen, where an intercessor would come forward and intercede 
          without being given permission. The intercession which is affirmed by 
          Allaah and His Messenger is that which comes after His permission is 
          given, as in the aayahs (interpretation of the meaning):  
“…Who 
          is he that can intercede with Him except with His Permission?…” 
[al-Baraqah 
          2:255]  
“and 
          they cannot intercede except for him with whom He is pleased” 
[al-Anbiyaa’ 
          21:28]  
“Intercession 
          with Him profits not except for him whom He permits” 
[Saba’ 
          34:23]

13932,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13932,The wisdom behind facing the Ka’bah,"I hope u can help me. I became a muslim a couple of years ago. My family are finding it hard to accept my ibada. But recently i have made a fuss about my salat and insisted i must pray. Alhamdulilah they have accepted it after seeing i became upset and depressed at living in a house where i was not allowed to practise my basic pillars of islam. They are ask me questions (Alhamdulilah), of which one of them is ""why do we face the kaba if we r not worshipping it as we prostrate towards it?"". I tried to explain that it is not the kaba but Allah to whom we prostrate and the kaba is for reasons of unity and that because it was the first house of Allah. I would be grateful if you could help me by explaining this further so i can understand it myself and explain this to my family and other kuffar. And also please can you make dua that they are guided on the right path",,,"Praise be to Allah.Who has guided you to Islam; we ask Him 
    to make you steadfast in it until you meet Him, for He is all Hearing, Ever 
    Responsive. Praise be to Allaah Who has made you keen to pray and to 
    practise your religion openly. We ask Allaah to guide your family and to 
    grant you the joy of seeing them become Muslim… Ameen. 
    
    With regard to our facing the Ka’bah, you should note, may 
    Allaah bless you, that in this universe there is none other than Creator and 
    created, worshippers and the One Who is worshipped. The Creator and the One 
    Who is rightfully worshipped is Allaah alone; everything other than Him is 
    created and worships Him either willingly and by choice – which is the case 
    with the believers – or by force, which is the case of the kaafirs and 
    sinners, whose submission to Allaah consists of their being subjugated to 
    His control, for they do not have to power to either benefit or harm 
    themselves. Allaah is the One Who has given them life, and when He wills He 
    will cause them to die. If Allaah wills, He can make them sick, and if He 
    wills He can heal them. He can make them rich whenever He wants and make 
    them poor whenever He wants. Glory and praise be to Him, there is no Lord 
    besides Him and none worthy of worship except Him. 

    With regard to his believing slaves, they are tried and 
    tested in this brief, transient world. If they succeed in remaining 
    steadfast in worshipping their Lord and attaining the highest degree of 
    submission to Him, He will compensate them for that, by His kindness and 
    grace, with Paradise in which there is that which no eye has seen, no ear 
    has heard, and it has not entered the heart of man. 

    Among these tests is the fact that Allaah commands them to do 
    some things for which their minds cannot comprehend the wisdom behind them, 
    they can only submit and obey. This is in order to distinguish those who are 
    sincere in their claims to be believers from those who are insincere. For 
    Allaah is the Creator of reason, and He is the One Who issues the command, 
    so whoever responds and submits, and says, “I hear and obey, even though I 
    do not understand the reason, because I admit my mortality, my weakness and 
    my submission to Allaah, for Allaah cannot be questioned as to what He does” 
    – such a one is a believer who, it is hoped, will prosper and succeed in 
    this world and in the Hereafter. 

    This is how the Companions of the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) were, as al-Bukhaari (1597) and Muslim 
    (1270) narrated in their Saheehs that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may 
    Allaah be pleased with him) said of the Black Stone when he kissed it: “By 
    Allaah, I know that you are only a stone and you can neither bring benefit 
    nor cause harm. Were it not that I had seen the Messenger of Allaah kissing 
    you I would not have kissed you.” So when we Muslims pray facing the 
    direction of the Ka’bah, we do so because Allaah has commanded us to do 
    that. If he had commanded us to pray facing in any other direction, we would 
    have had to do that. The same applies to many other acts of worship, We pray 
    Zuhr with four rak’ahs and Maghrib with three and Fajr with two, because 
    Allaah has commanded us to do so. We perform Tawaaf seven times around the 
    Ka’bah, and we stone the Jamaraat seven times, and we do not do more than 
    that under any circumstances. All of that is because that is what Allaah has 
    commanded us to do. 

    So whoever bears this thought in mind whilst doing these acts 
    of worship will undoubtedly increase in submission to Allaah; this will 
    increase his faith and bring him closer to his Lord. Thus he will find great 
    joy and immense happiness and deep contentment in his heart, which will make 
    him long for worship and love it, because when he does acts of worship he 
    will feel that he is doing them for Allaah, and were it not for Allaah, he 
    would not do them. So every act of worship brings him closer to Allaah and 
    increases him in faith until he meets Allaah and Allaah will honour him as 
    He honours His righteous slaves. 

    But for the one who is stubborn and arrogant, and says, “I 
    will not do it until I understand”, this is like Iblees who rebelled against 
    Allaah and said, as Allaah tells us in the Qur’aan (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “Shall I prostrate myself to one whom You created from clay?”

    [al-Israa’ 17:61] 

    This is sufficient to demonstrate the seriousness of arguing 
    against the sharee’ah on the basis of reason. Rather Allaah has described 
    one of the most unique characteristics of the pious believers as being 
    belief in the Unseen. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “This is the Book (the Qur’aan), whereof there is no 
    doubt, a guidance to those who are Al-Muttaqoon [the pious believers of 
    Islamic Monotheism who fear Allaah much (abstain from all kinds of sins and 
    evil deeds which He has forbidden) and love Allaah much (perform all kinds 
    of good deeds which He has ordained)].

    Who believe in the Ghayb (the unseen) and perform 
    As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as-Salaah), and spend out of what we have provided for 
    them”

    [al-Baqarah 2:2-3]

    So the first characteristic by which the believers are 
    distinguished from others is the fact that they believe in the unseen or 
    that which they cannot grasp, whether that is in a literal, physical sense 
    or in a metaphorical, intellectual sense. 

    What we should point out here is that our prayer facing the 
    direction of the Ka’bah has nothing to do with the structure of the Ka’bah, 
    rather it has to do with its location. If it were to be destroyed, we would 
    still pray in that direction, not to that structure. 

    Hence we find that nowadays Muslims pray on the second storey 
    and on the roof of the Grand Mosque in the Sanctuary of Makkah, facing the 
    direction of the Ka’bah even though it is not directly in front of them. 
    This is what millions of Muslims do throughout the world, praying in the 
    direction of the Ka’bah even though they cannot see it. This demonstrates 
    the great difference between the laws of Islam and the actions of the 
    mushrikeen (polytheists) whose worship of their idols, stones and trees 
    ceases when these objects cease to exist. Therefore if the mushrik cannot 
    see his object of worship or idol, he does not face the direction of that 
    thing. 

    We ask Allaah to bestow upon us sincere faith, and to make us 
    steadfast in it until we meet Him… Aameen.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

Reward for fasting


Number of the gates of Paradise


Gate of Jannah for Fasting


The gates of Paradise are open in Ramadan","Praise be to Allah.Virtues of Ramadan
Allah has enjoined upon the Muslims fasting the month of Ramadan , and He has promised a great reward to those who fast. Because the virtue of fasting is so great, Allah has not specified the reward for it, rather He said – in a hadIth qudsi – “… except for fasting, for it is for Me, and I shall reward for it.” 
The virtues of the month of Ramadan are many . For example, that which Allah has promised those who fast, namely the gate of ar-Rayyan. This is the name which was narrated in the hadith whose authenticity is agreed upon. Sahl (may Allah be pleased with him) said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “In Paradise there is a gate called al-Rayyan, through which those who used to fast will enter on the Day of Resurrection, and no one but they will enter it. It will be said, ‘Where are those who fasted?’ They will get up, and none will enter it but them. When they have entered, it will be locked, and no one else will enter.” (al-Bukhari, 1763; Muslim, 1947) 
Reward for fasting
Among the hadiths which explain the reward for fasting are the following: 

Abu Salamah narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Whoever fasts Ramadan out of faith and seeking reward, his previous sins will be forgiven.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, al-Iman, 37) 
Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Allah says: “Every deed of the son of Adam is for him, except for fasting; it is for Me and I shall reward for it.” Fasting is a shield and when one of you is fasting he avoid sexual relations with his wife and quarreling. If somebody should fight or quarrel with him, he should say, ‘I am fasting.’ By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, the unpleasant smell coming out from the mouth of a fasting person is better in the sight of Allah than the smell of musk. The fasting person will have two moments of joy: one when he breaks his fast, and the other when he meets his Lord; then he will be pleased because of his fasting.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1771) 

Number of the gates of Paradise
It is known that Paradise has many gates , because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“‘Adn (Eden) Paradise (everlasting Gardens), which they shall enter and (also) those who acted righteously from among their fathers, and their wives, and their offspring. And angels shall enter unto them from every gate.” [al-Ra’d 13:23] 
“And those who kept their duty to their Lord (Al-Muttaqun – the pious) will be led to Paradise in groups till when they reach it, and its gates will be opened (before their arrival for their reception) and its keepers will say: Salamun ‘Alaykum (peace be upon you)! You have done well, so enter here to abide therein.” [al-Zumar 39:73]
Gate of Jannah for Fasting
In the sahih hadiths, it says that there are eight gates: 
Sahl ibn Sa’d (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “In Paradise there are eight gates, among which is a gate called ar-Rayyan, which none will enter but those who fast.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3017) 
`Ubadah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever bears witness that there is no god but Allah Alone, with no partner or associate, and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger, and that ‘Isa is the slave of Allah and His Messenger, and a word which Allah bestowed on Maryam and a spirit created by Him (cf. al-Nisa 4:171), and that Paradise is true and Hell is true, will have the right to be admitted by Allah to Paradise through whichever of the eight gates he wishes, because of his good deeds.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3180; Muslim, 41)                 
The gates of Paradise are open in Ramadan
One of the bounties that Allah has bestowed upon this ummah is that He opens all the gates of Paradise during the month of Ramadan, not just one gate. Whoever says that there is a gate in Paradise called Bab al-Ridwan has to produce evidence for that. 
Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When Ramadan begins, the gates of Paradise are opened and the gates of Hell are closed, and the devils are chained up .” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3035; Muslim 1793)

    If the alcohol content of cologne is at such a level that one 
    could become intoxicated by drinking a lot of it, it is haraam to keep it, 
    whether a little of itor a lot, and it must be poured away and destroyed 
    because it is khamr (an intoxicant). It was proven that the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded the Muslims to pour 
    away whatever wine they had when the following verse was revealed 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! 
    Intoxicants (all kinds of alcoholic drinks), and gambling, and 
    Al‑Ansaab,[stone altars for sacrifice to idols, jinn, etc] and Al‑Azlaam 
    (arrows for seeking luck or decision) are an abomination of Shaytaan’s 
    (Satan’s) handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) in order 
    that you may be successful.

    91. Shaytaan (Satan) wants only to excite enmity and 
    hatred between you with intoxicants (alcoholic drinks) and gambling, and 
    hinder you from the remembrance of Allaah and from As‑Salaah (the prayer). 
    So, will you not then abstain?”

    [al-Maa’idah 5:90-91]

    And it was proven that the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whatever intoxicates in large amounts, a 
    little of it is haraam.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1865; Abu Dawood, 3681; 
    classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 

    Based on this, it is haraam to drink it, perfume oneself with 
    it or purify oneself with it. But if the alcohol content is not at such a 
    level that drinking a lot of it would cause intoxication, then it is 
    permissible to buy it and keep it and use it as a perfume or for purifying 
    oneself, because the basic principle is that things are permissible unless 
    there is proof to the contrary.","Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 22/143"
13945,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13945,It is permissible to waive part of a debt in return for bringing forward repayment.,"I have a debt which is not due to be repaid yet, but the lender has asked me to repay it ahead of time. I agreed, but on condition that he waive part of the debt. Is that permissible?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.If the lender or debtor wants to pay off the 
    debt before it is due, it is permissible to waive part of the debt in return for bringing forward the repayment. 
This issue is referred to by the scholars as 
    da’ wa ta’ajjal, i.e., waive part of the debt and bring forward repayment. 
The scholars differed as to whether this 
    transaction is valid. Most of the scholars were of the view that it is haraam, and they quoted as evidence the fact that this transaction is akin 
    to riba, concerning which there is consensus that it is haraam. Riba (interest, usury) means paying extra on a debt in return for delaying 
    payment. But in this case it is the mirror image, i.e., reducing the debt in return for bringing forward repayment. 
Al-Sarkhasi said in his book al-Mabsoot: 
If a man owes something to another man, to be paid later, and it is the price of something that 
    has been bought, and he waives part of it in return for bringing the payment forward, that is not good … because this is the mirror image of 
    increasing the debt in return for delaying payment, which is riba. Do you not see that in the case of a debt that is due, if they agree to 
    increase the debt so that he can pay it later, do you not agree that this is not permissible? By the same token, with regard to the debt that is 
    not yet due, waiving part of it in return for it being paid sooner is the same. 
Ibn Rushd al-Maaliki said in his book 
    Bidaayah al-Mujtahid (2/144): The argument of those who said that this is not permissible is that it is like paying extra if more time is 
    given, and there is consensus that that is haraam.  
Others were of the view that it is 
    permissible, such as ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Abbaas and Zayd ibn Thaabit (may Allaah be pleased with them). This is also one of the two opinions of Imam 
    al_Shaafa’i and Imam Ahmad. This view was also favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and his student Ibn al-Qayyim.  It was also regarded as 
    permissible by Ibn ‘Aabideen among the Hanafi fuqaha’, as stated in his footnotes on al-Durr al-Mukhtaar, 5/160 
They quoted several things as evidence for its being permissible: 
1 – The report narrated by al-Haakim and 
    al-Tabaraani from Ibn ‘Abbaas, according to which when the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was commanded to expel Bani 
    al-Nadeer, some of them came to him and said: “O Prophet of Allaah, you have been commanded to expel us but some people owe us money which is not 
    due to be paid yet.” The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Waive some of the debt so that they will pay 
    you sooner.” 
In Majma’ al-Zawaa’id it says that its 
    isnaad includes Muslim ibn Khaalid al-Zinji, who is da’eef (weak) but some regarded him as mawthooq (trustworthy).  
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    said in Ahkaam Ahl al-Dhimmah (1/396): Its isnaad is hasan and there is nothing wrong with it apart from Muslim ibn Khaalid al-Zinji, whose 
    hadeeth does not go below the level of hasan. 
2 – The words of ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Abbaas (may 
    Allaah be pleased with him): “Rather riba means delay payment for me and I shall increase the amount; it does not mean bring forward the payment 
    and I will waive some of the debt.” 
3 – The fact that this transaction benefits 
    both parties (the lender and the debtor); the lender benefits from having the loan repaid sooner, and the debtor benefits from having part of the 
    debt waived. 
They responded to the evidence of those who 
    regard it as haraam by stating that comparing this transaction to riba is not correct, because it is the opposite of riba. In the case of riba, 
    the debt is increased in return for delaying repayment, but in this case the debt and the time are both reduced. So how can something be compared 
    to its opposite? This is what is meant by the words of Ibn ‘Abbaas quoted above. 
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    said: 
This is the opposite of riba, for riba means 
    increasing the time allowed and the amount owed, which is harmful to the debtor. But what we are talking about means that the debtor pays off his 
    debt and the lender benefits by receiving repayment sooner. So both parties benefit without either being harmed, unlike the case of riba on which 
    there is consensus, because in that case the harm is done to the debtor, and all the benefit goes to the lender. This is the opposite of riba. 
The Standing Committee was asked about this 
    matter and said: 
This is an issue concerning which there is a 
    difference of opinion among the scholars. The correct scholarly view is that it is permissible to waive debts and bring forward repayment. This 
    was narrated from Imam Ahmad and was the view favoured by Shaykh Ibn Taymiyah and Shaykh Ibn al-Qayyim. It was attributed to Ibn ‘Abbaas (may 
    Allaah be pleased with him). 
Fataawa al-Lajnah, 
    13/168 
A statement issued by the Fiqh Council says: 
Waiving part of a debt in order to bring forward repayment, whether that is at the request of the lender or the debtor, is permissible according to sharee’ah, and it is not the kind of riba that is haraam.

But if a woman’s usual cycle is to have blood then brownish discharge then yellowish discharge within a certain time limit such as seven days, then she finds that she is dry, then she should do ghusl and start praying – she does not have to wait a whole day. If a woman sees that she is taahir (pure), whether by noting the whitish discharge or the dryness for more than one day, then she experiences a brownish or yellowish discharge, that doesn’t matter, and she should not pay any attention to it; she should remain taahir, unless blood is discharged – because Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “We used to pay no attention to a brownish or yellowish discharge after becoming taahir.” Based on the above, you have to figure out what your cycle is, whether it is irregular or regular. The woman with an irregular cycle has to wait until she becomes taahir, unless her bleeding etc. lasts for more than fifteen days; if it reaches this extent and she did not become taahir, then she should do ghusl and start praying, and there is no sin on her in sha Allah. The woman whose cycle is regular should follow the details described above.",Shaykh Sa’d al-Humayd

The author of al-Qamus said: “Jawrab (socks) means something that is wrapped around the feet.” 
Abu Bakr ibn al-‘Arabi said: “Jawrab means a thin cover for the feet made of wool, worn to keep the feet warm.” 
Yahya al-Bakka said: “I heard Ibn `Umar saying, “Wiping over the socks (jawrabayn) is like wiping over the leather slippers (khuffayn).” (Al-Musannaf by Ibn Abi Shaybah, 1/173)

13956,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13956,Spending time watching movies and soap operas and playing games in Ramadaan,"Some fasting people spend most of the day in Ramadaan watching movies and soap operas on videos and TVs, and playing cards. What is the ruling on that?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Muslims, whether they are fasting or not, should fear Allaah with regard to what they are doing and not doing at all times. They must avoid that which Allaah has forbidden, namely watching obscene movies which show things that Allaah has forbidden such as naked and semi-naked pictures, or reprehensible programs, or things which appear on TV that go against the laws of Allaah, such as images, singing, musical instruments and misleading ideas. Every Muslim, whether he is fasting or not, must avoid playing with cards and other kinds of games, because that involves witnessing evil and doing wrong, and because it also causes hardness and disease in the heart, makes a person take the laws of Allaah lightly and makes him find it too difficult to do the things that Allaah has enjoined, such as praying in congregation and other obligations, and makes him fall into doing many haraam things. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And of mankind is he who purchases idle talks (i.e. music, singing) to mislead (men) from the path of Allaah without knowledge, and takes it (the path of Allaah, or the Verses of the Qur’aan) by way of mockery. For such there will be a humiliating torment (in the Hell-fire).
And when Our Verses (of the Qur’aan) are recited to such a one, he turns away in pride, as if he heard them not — as if there were deafness in his ear. So announce to him a painful torment”[Luqmaan 31:6-7]
And He says in Soorat al-Furqaan, describing the slaves of the Most Merciful (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And those who do not bear witness to falsehood, and if they pass by some evil play or evil talk, they pass by it with dignity”[al-Furqaan 25:72]
Falsehood (al-zoor) includes all kinds of evil, and the phrase “do not bear witness” means that they do not attend where these things are happening. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There will be among my ummah people who will permit adultery, silk, alcohol and musical instruments.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh in a mu’allaq majzoom report). What is meant by adultery is illegal sexual relations, and musical instruments include singing. Allaah has forbidden to the Muslims all means that lead to haraam things, and undoubtedly watching bad movies and the evils that are shown on TV are among the means that lead to haraam things or lead one to take such matters lightly without denouncing them.

Why Did Allah Send Prophets and Messengers?


Why do we need prophets?","Praise be to Allah.Who are the prophets?
Prophets are the Messengers of Allah to His slaves; they convey His commands, and give them glad tidings of the delights that Allah has promised them if they obey His commands, and they warn them of the abiding punishment if they go against His prohibitions. They tell them the stories of the past nations and the punishment and vengeance that befell them in this world because they disobeyed the commands of their Lord. 
These divine commands and prohibitions cannot be known through independent thinking, hence Allah has prescribed laws and enjoined commands and prohibitions, to honor mankind and protect their interests, because people may follow their desires and thus transgress the limits and abuse people and deprive them of their rights. 
Why Did Allah Send Prophets and Messengers?
So by His wisdom Allah sent among them from time to time messengers to remind them of the commands of Allah and to warn them against falling into sin, to preach to them and to tell them the stories of those who came before them. For when people hear wondrous stories it makes their minds alert, so they understand and increase in knowledge and understand correctly. For the more people hear, the more ideas they will have; the more ideas they have, the more they will think; the more they think, the more they will know; and the more they know, the more they will do.  So there is no alternative to sending messengers in order to explain the truth. (A’lam al-Nubuwwah by ‘Ali ibn Muhammad al-Mawardi, p. 33) 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) – Ahmad ibn ‘Abd al-Halim ibn ‘Abd al-Salam, who is well known as Ibn Taymiyah, born in 661 AH and died in 728 AH, one of the greatest scholars of Islam who wrote many valuable books – said: 
“Messengership is essential to guide mankind to that which is best for them in this world and in the Hereafter. Man cannot follow what is best for him with regard to the Hereafter unless he follows the message and he cannot be guided to what is best for him in this world unless he follows the message. Man needs the Shari`ah (Divine law) because he has two motives, to bring that which will benefit him and to ward off that which will harm him. This Shari`ah is the light of Allah on this earth, and His justice among His slaves, and the refuge which whoever enters it will be safe. 
Shari`ah does not mean distinguishing between what is beneficial and what is harmful on a physical basis, because even animals are able to do this. Donkeys and camels are able to differentiate between barley and dust. Rather the distinction is between deeds which will harm a person in this world and the Hereafter, and deeds which will benefit him in this world and in the Hereafter, such as faith, Tawhid, justice, righteousness, kindness, trustworthiness, chastity, courage, knowledge, patience, enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, upholding the ties of kinship, honouring one’s parents, treating neighbours well, recognizing people’s rights, sincerely doing things for the sake of Allah, putting one's trust in Him, seeking His help, accepting His decree, submitting to His will, believing in Him and in His messengers in all that they have told us, and other deeds which are of benefit to a person in this world and in the Hereafter. The opposite of that leads him to misery and doom in this world and in the Hereafter. 
Were it not for the messengers, our minds could not guide us to differentiate between the beneficial and the harmful in this life in a detailed manner. One of the greatest blessings that Allah has bestowed upon His slaves is that He sent messengers to them and revealed books to them, and showed them the Straight Path. Were it not for that, they would have been like cattle, and even worse off. So whoever accepts the Message of Allah and adheres to it is one of the best of mankind, and whoever rejects it and ignores it is one of the worst of mankind, even worse off than dogs and pigs, and the vilest of the vile. The people of this world could not survive except by virtue of the messengers’ teachings, traces of which are still extant amongst them. If these traces of the messengers vanished from the earth and their teachings were wiped out, Allah would destroy the upper and lower realms and the Hour would begin. 
The need of the people of the earth for the messengers is not like their need for the sun, moon, wind and rain, or like a man’s need for his life, or like the eye’s need for light, or like the body’s need for food and drink. Rather it is greater than that, greater than his need for anything you could think of. The messengers (peace and blessings of Allah be upon them) are intermediaries between Allah and His creation, conveying His commands and prohibitions. They are ambassadors from Him to His slaves. The last and greatest of them, the noblest before his Lord, was Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, and upon all of them). Allah sent him as a mercy to the worlds, guidance for those who want to draw closer to Allah, proof which left no excuse for all people. He enjoined the people to obey him, love him, respect him, support him, and acknowledge his rights. Allah took the covenant from all the messengers and prophets that they would believe in him and follow him, and He commanded them to take the same covenant from the believers who followed them. He sent him just before the Hour as a bringer of glad tidings and a warner, calling people to Allah by His leave and as a brightly shining lamp. He concluded the line of messengers with him. Through him He guided people and dispelled misguidance, taught them and dispelled ignorance. Through his message He opened blind eyes, deaf ears and hard hearts. Through his message He filled the world with light after it had been in darkness, He brought people together after they had been divided, He straightened the crooked path of mankind and showed them the clear way. He opened his heart for him and removed from him his burden, and raised high his fame (cf. al-Sharh 94:1-3). He inflicted humiliation and shame on those who went against his command. He sent him (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) at a time when there had been no messengers for a long while and when the Books had vanished, when words had been distorted and laws changed, when all peoples referred to their own unfair opinions, developed their own ideas about Allah and judged among people by their own corrupt ideas and whims and desires. Through him Allah guided mankind and clarified the different means of drawing closer to Allah. Through him, He brought the people forth from darkness into light. Through him, He differentiated between those who will prosper and those who are immoral. So whoever follows his guidance is truly guided, and whoever turns away from his path is misguided and has deviated. May Allah send blessings and peace upon him and upon all the messengers and prophets . (( Wujub al-I’tisam bi’l-Risalah by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him), vol. 19, p. 99-102; and from Majmu’ al-Fatawa. See Lawami’ al-Anwar al-Bahiyyah, vol. 2, p. 216, 236) 
Why do we need prophets?
We may sum up man’s need for the messengers as follows: 

Man is created and subjugated, and he has to know his Creator and what He wants of him, and why he was created. Man cannot come to know that independently. He has no way of finding that out except through knowing the prophets and messengers , and the guidance and light which they brought.
Man is composed of body and soul, His body is nourished by his food and drink, but the nourishment of his soul is that which was explained by its Creator, namely the true religion and righteous deeds. The prophets and messengers brought the true religion and taught them to do righteous deeds.
Man is religious by nature; he has to have a religion to follow, and this religion has to be correct. There is no way to the true religion except through believing in the prophets and messengers and believing in the message they brought.
Man needs the way through which he may attain the pleasure of Allah in this world, and reach His Paradise and bliss in the Hereafter. No one can show these ways and guide people to them apart from the prophets and messengers.
Man is weak by nature, and there are many enemies lying in wait for him, such as the Shaytan who wants to lead him astray and bad companions who make evil things attractive to him, and his own self which is inclined towards evil. Hence he needs something to protect himself from the plots of his enemies. The prophets and messengers guide him towards that and show it to him clearly.
Man is sociable by nature. In human meetings and interactions, there have to be laws to guide people in a fair and just manner – otherwise the law of the jungle would prevail. This guiding law must protect the rights of all those who have rights, without neglecting or exaggerating in any way. No one can produce a perfect law except the prophets and messengers.
Man needs something that will give him security and peace of mind, and guide him to the means of true happiness. This is what the prophets and messengers guide people towards.

Go out of the house : she is only allowed to do so for a necessity, such as if she is sick and needs to go to the hospital, in which case she should go during the day; or in the case of emergencies such as if her house is about to fall down and she fears that it may collapse on top of her; or in the case of fire; and so on. 

The scholars said: “She may go out during the day for necessary purposes, but at night she should not go out unless it is essential.” 

Wear perfume: the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade the  mourning woman from wearing perfume except when she purifies herself following her period, in which case she may apply a little Azfar (a kind of perfume) after her period ends, to remove the traces of menstruation odour
Wear beautiful clothes : the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade the woman from wearing clothes that are considered to be adornments while mourning. Rather she should wear ordinary clothes such as the kind that she usually wears inside her house, without making herself look beautiful
Apply kohl: the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade that. If she needs to use it, she should use the kind of kohl whose colour is not obvious, applying it at night and removing it during the day 
Wear jewellery : if a woman is forbidden from wearing beautiful clothes while mourning, it is more appropriate that jewellery should not be allowed. 

Permissible practices for a mourning woman:
It is permissible for a widow in mourning to:

Speak to men 
Speak on the telephone
Allow people to enter the house who are permitted to do so according to Shari`ah
Go onto the roof of her house during the night and during the day. 

Practices women are not compelled to do during mourning:
There are some practices that women commonly do while mourning which they are not compelled to do, such as:

Perform ghusl every week as some of the common folk think
Undo their hair every week
A widow in mourning does not have to – indeed it is not prescribed for her to – go out when her `iddah (waiting period) ends and give charity to the first person she meets. This is an act of bid`ah (religious innovation).

Thanks?,,,"Praise be to Allah.First of all, please see Question # 1200 for an important ruling of mixing of the sexes. 
Secondly, it is not permissible for a woman to go out of her house wearing perfume. Whoever does that is exposing herself to the stern warning. It says in the hadith which was narrated from Ghumaym ibn Qays that, “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Any woman who perfumes herself then passes by people so that they may smell her fragrance is an adulteress.’” (narrated by al-Nasaa’i, al-Zeenah, 5036; classed as hasan by al-Albani in Saheeh Sunan al-Nasaa’i, 4737). 
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded women who go to the mosque not to wear perfume; whoever does that has to wash herself. It says in the hadith of Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When a woman goes out to the mosque, let her wash herself from perfume as she washes herself from janaabah (impurity following sexual activity).” (narrated by al-Nasaa’i, al-Zeenah, 5037; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan al-Nasaa’i, 4738)                                                                     
Thirdly: with regard to a fasting person inhaling the perfume, this does not matter. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was asked about that and he said: it is permissible to use it during the day in Ramadan and to smell it, except for bukhoor (incense) which should not be inhaled, because it has a substance which may reach the stomach and it is smoke. 
Fatawa Islamiyyah, 2/128 
If you find traces of this woman’s perfume spray in your throat, there is no sin on you in sha Allah. The point is that the fast is broken when something that has substance reaches the throat as a result of a deliberate action. This perfume does not have any substance, and you have no sin in the matter and are not doing anything deliberately. Allah says (interpretation of the meanings): 
“And there is no sin on you concerning that in which you made a mistake, except in regard to what your hearts deliberately intend. And Allah is Ever Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful” [al-Ahzaab 33:5]

13973,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13973,It is permissible to raise the price of a product in return for paying in installments,Is it permissible to sell by installments when the price of the product is increased?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Selling in installments means that you get the product sooner and pay all or part of the price later in known installments over a known period of time. 
The importance of knowing the ruling on this matter:
 Buying by installments is one of the issues where we should pay attention to finding out the rulings, because it has become very widespread in dealings on the individual and international level after the Second World War. 
So companies and corporations buy products from the suppliers by installments, and they sell them to their customers by installments, such as cars, real estate and tools, etc. 
One of the things that led to this becoming widespread is the fact that some of the banks also deal in such transactions, whereby the bank buys the product with cash and sells it to its customers by installments.  
Ruling on buying by installments. 
There is a text which states that it is permissible to buy by installments, which means buying a product and delaying payment. 
Al-Bukhaari (2068) and Muslim (1603) narrated from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) bought some food from a Jew to be paid for later, and put an iron shield in pledge for it. 
This hadeeth indicates that it is permissible to make a purchase with delayed payment, and buying by installments is nothing other than buying with delayed payment; all it means is that the price is divided into amounts, each of which must be paid at a certain time. 
There is no difference between the shar’i ruling on a case where the whole price is paid later at one time, or where the price is paid later at different times. 
Al-Bukhaari (2168) narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: Bareerah came to me and said: “I drew up a contract of manumission with my master stating that I would pay nine waqiyaha, one waqiyah each year.” [A waqiyah is a weight of silver etc]. 
This hadeeth indicates that it is permissible to pay later in installments. 
Even though the texts state that it is permissible to delay payment, there is no text which states that it is permissible to increase the price in return for that delay. 
Hence the scholars differed concerning the ruling on this issue. 
A few scholars said that it is haraam, on the grounds that it is riba. They said: because this is increasing the price in return for the deferment, and this is riba. 
But the majority of scholars, including the four imams, were of the view that it is permissible. 
The comments of the scholars of the four madhhabs concerning this include the following: 
The Hanafi madhhab: “The price may be raised in return for delaying payment,” (Badaa’i’ al-Sanaa’i’, 5/187) 
The Maaliki madhhab: “For more time some amount may be added to the price.” (Bidaayat al-Mujtahid, 2/108) 
The Shaafa’i madhhab: “Five in cash is equivalent to six in deferred payment.” (al-Wajeez by al-Ghazaali, 1/85) 
The Hanbali madhhab: “Delay add something to the price.” (Fatawa Ibn Taymiyah, 29/499). 
They quoted evidence from the Qur’aan and Sunnah to support that, including the following: 
1 – Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allah has permitted trading”
[al-Baqarah 2:275]
The general meaning of this verse includes all forms of trading, which includes increasing the price in return for delaying payment. 
2 – Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Eat not up your property among yourselves unjustly except it be a trade amongst you, by mutual consent”
[al-Nisa’ 4:29]
The general meaning of this verse also indicates that trading is permissible if there is consent from both parties. If the purchaser agrees to pay a higher price in return for delaying payment, the transaction is valid. 
3 – al-Bukhaari (2086) narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came to Madeenah when they used to pay in advance the price of fruits to be delivered within two or three years. He said, “Whoever pays in advance the price of a thing to be delivered later should pay it for a specified measure at specified weight for a specified period.” 
Bay’ al-salam (forward buying) is permissible according to the texts and scholarly consensus, and it is akin to purchase by installments. The scholars mentioned that the wisdom behind it is that it benefits the purchaser by reducing the price and the vendor by bringing him money sooner. This indicates that something may be added to the price in return for delaying payment, and that there is nothing wrong with this when buying and selling. See al-Mughni, 6/385. 
4 – The actions of the Muslims indicate that it is permissible to increase the price in return for delaying payment, and none of them denounced that. So it became like consensus (ijma’) that this kind of transaction is permissible. 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz was asked about the ruling on increasing the price in return for delaying payment, He said: 
There is nothing wrong with this transaction because paying cash for the product is different from delaying payment. The Muslims are still doing such transactions and this is like consensus that it is permissible. Some scholars held an odd opinion and said that it is not permissible to increase the price in return for delaying payment, and they thought that this was a kind of riba, but this is a baseless view. It is not a kind of riba at all, because when the dealer sells the product to be paid for later, he agrees to the delay so that he may benefit from the increase in price, and the purchaser agrees to the increase so that he may take his time and because he is unable to pay the price in cash on the spot. So both of them benefit from this transaction. There is a proven report from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) which indicates that this is permissible; he commanded ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas (may Allah be pleased with him) to equip an army and he was buying one camel for two camels, to be handed over at a later date. Moreover this transaction comes under the general meaning of the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
 
“O you who believe! When you contract a debt for a fixed period, write it down”
[al-Baqarah 2:282] 
This transaction is one of the permissible kinds of debt that are mentioned in this verse; it is also akin to forward buying (bay’ al-salam).

“And march forth [lit. hasten] in the way (which leads to) forgiveness from your Lord, and for Paradise as wide as the heavens and the earth, prepared for Al-Muttaqoon (the pious)”

Moreover, if a person delays that, he does not know what will happen to him. He may die leaving this obligation unfulfilled; fulfilling one's duty is obligatory. 
Also the poor may be depending upon that, and if he delays it, the poor will remain needy and not have enough to meet their needs. See al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 6/197 
The Standing Committee was asked about a man who possesses the nisaab in Rajab but wants to delay paying zakah until Ramadan. The committee replied: 
It is obligatory for you to pay zakah in Rajab in the year following the year in which you took possession of the nisaab. But if you want to pay it in Ramadan of the year in which you took possession of the nisaab, paying it before the year has passed, that is permissible, if there is a valid need for it to be brought forward. But delaying it until the Ramadan that comes after the year has passed and it has become due in Rajab is not permissible, because it is obligatory to pay it as soon as it becomes due. 
Fatawa al-Lajnah, 9/392. 
Whoever is obliged to pay zakah and delays it with no valid shar’i excuse is sinning, because the evidence of the Quran and Sunnah shows that zakah must be paid as soon as it falls due. 
According to another fatwa (9/398): 
It is not permissible to delay paying zakah after the year has passed, unless that is for a valid shar’i excuse, such as there being no poor people at the time when the year has passed, or not being able to get the zakah to them, or because the money is not available, etc. But delaying it until Ramadan is not permissible unless the period is very short, such as if the year will have passed in the second half of Sha’baan, in which case there is nothing wrong with delaying it until Ramadan.",Islam Q&A

13986,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13986,Good deeds done before saying Shahaadah are not valid,"I will post my question again, I have been reading the Qur'an the past 2 years and am almost through it. In my reading I have become more and more convinced about the truth of the Qur'an and I have this year for the first time started to fast with my friends.
My period started on the 2nd fast and I was given conflicting advice by 2 lady friends. One said continue with the fast the other said to stop. I then asked a male friend and he advised me to stop.
Yesterday I read an article on Ramadan and it said that if you have not said the Kalimah your fast is not accepted. I am not going to repeat my whole story here, but I have sent the Kalimah to a friend as an SMS and they all know I do believe.
My situation does not permit me to openly live the life of a Muslim and I have begged God to help me. I believe He understands my situation. May I continue to fast or should I stop?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.We ask Allaah to open your heart to Islam and to help you to adhere to the rituals of Islam, both outwardly and inwardly. Undoubtedly your keenness to read Qur’aan and to fast indicate that you possess a great deal of goodness and love for righteous deeds. We ask Allaah to give you strength and help you. But you have to realize that this great religion comes from Allaah, the All-Wise and All-Knowing. Whatever is enjoined by Allaah and by His Messenger is Islam, and we can only know Islam through the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who is the one who conveyed it from Allaah. 
The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) has told us in more than one hadeeth that Allaah does not accept any righteous deeds until after the person has uttered the Shahaadatayn. Indeed he told his companions not to tell anyone to do any of the rituals of Islam until they had pronounced the Shahaadatayn. In Saheeh al-Bukhaari (7372) and Saheeh Muslim (19) it was narrated that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sent Mu’aadh to Yemen to call the People of the Book to Islam, he said to him: “You are going to some people from among the People of the Book. Call them to bear witness that there is no god but Allaah and that I am the Messenger of Allaah. If they accept that, then tell them that Allaah has enjoined on them five prayers each day and night. If they accept that, then tell them that Allaah has enjoined upon them charity [zakaah] to be taken from their rich and given to their poor…” According to a report in Saheeh Muslim he said: “Let the first thing to which you call them be…” 
Hence it should be clear to you – may Allaah help you to do good – that uttering the Shahaadatayn is the first thing that the Muslim must do if he wants to become Muslim. It is not essential for you to announce that to your family if you are not able to do that and you fear for yourself and your religion. Rather it is sufficient for you to say these words to yourself, until the time comes when you can announce it to others, when you must do so.  
With regard to fasting, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told menstruating women to refrain from prayer and fasting during menses (the monthly period). When the period ends, a woman has to make up the fasts of the days that she has missed. With regard to prayer, she does not have to make up the prayers. The evidence for that is as follows. 
A woman asked ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her), why it is that a woman who menstruates has to make up the fasts but not the prayers? She said: “Are you a Haroori?” She said, “No, I am just asking.” ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: “That (menstruation) used to happen to us at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and we were commanded to make up the fasts but we were not commanded to make up the prayers.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 321; Muslim, 335. 
This woman wondered why, when her period came and she did not fast or pray, Allaah commanded women to make up the fasts but not the prayers. ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) replied by telling her that this was the command of Allaah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and we must accept the command of Allaah and His Messenger without raising objections based on our weak mental capacity which can only encompass a little of the wisdom of Allaah the Most Wise, All-Knowing, which is what Allaah has taught us. 
The ruling which we have mentioned is agreed upon by all the Muslim scholars. Imam Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his book al-Tamheed (16/67): “A woman who is menstruating should not pray, and there is consensus on this point.” And he also said  (22/107): “… There is consensus that a menstruating woman should not pray during the days of her period, and she should make up the missed fasts but not the prayers, and there is no difference of opinion on any of that.” 
With regard to the rest of the rituals of Islam, you have to do whatever you can. Whatever you are unable to do because of fear for yourself or your religion, you are not obliged to do, as the scholars have stated, because in that case you come under the ruling of one who has no choice, and Allaah made allowances for the one who is forced to disbelieve (outwardly), so long as his heart remains open to faith and still hates kufr (disbelief). Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Whoever disbelieved in Allaah after his belief, except him who is forced thereto and whose heart is at rest with Faith; but such as open their breasts to disbelief, on them is wrath from Allaah, and theirs will be a great torment”
[al-Nahl 16:106]
See al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 13/196 
But you have to practise as much as you can of the rituals of Islam, then try to reach a place where you will be able to practise as much as you can of the rituals of Islam. This action is what the scholars of Islam call hijrah (migration for the sake of Allaah), and it is obligatory for every Muslim man and woman if they are unable to establish the rituals of Islam in their own country and they are able to migrate. The evidence for that is the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, as for those whom the angels take (in death) while they are wronging themselves (as they stayed among the disbelievers even though emigration was obligatory for them), they (angels) say (to them): “In what (condition) were you?” They reply: “We were weak and oppressed on the earth.” They (angels) say: “Was not the earth of Allaah spacious enough for you to emigrate therein?” Such men will find their abode in Hell — what an evil destination!
Except the weak ones among men, women and children who cannot devise a plan, nor are they able to direct their way”
[al-Nisa’ 4:97-98]
This indicates that only those who are weak are excused the obligation of migrating. 
It says in Mughni al-Muhtaaj (6/54): 
If a person is not able to practise his religion openly or he fears persecution, then it is obligatory for him to migrate, whether man or woman, even if she does not have a mahram (if they are able to migrate), because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, as for those whom the angels take (in death) while they are wronging themselves…” And because of the report narrated by Abu Dawood and others (according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said): “I disavow every Muslim who stays among the mushrikeen (polytheists, those who associate others with Allaah).” A saheeh hadeeth  - al-Irwa’, 5/30. 
Ibn Rushd said: It is obligatory, according to the Qur’aan, Sunnah and consensus of the Muslims for the one who becomes Muslim in a kaafir country to migrate therefrom and move to a Muslim country; he should not live or settle among the mushrikeen. That applies if he is unable to practise his religion, or he is forced to adhere to the rulings of kufr. 
From al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 4/264 
Even though migration means leaving one’s family and homeland, Allaah will fill the person’s heart with happiness which will make him keen to migrate. 
Thus it will become clear to you that so long as you are unable to practise the rituals of Islam, then Allaah by His mercy will excuse you, and whatever you are able to do, then you are obliged to do it, even if you do it in secret. If you have to put up with some difficulties that you are able to bear in order to do that, then Allaah will reward greatly the one who patiently bears hardship for His sake and for the sake of His religion. The Book of Allaah is filled with stories that speak of that. Even though uttering the Shahaadatayn is so important, Allaah has made that very easy. So we advise you to utter these words even if you only say them to yourself, because the soundness of your Islam depends on that, as I am sure you understand, until Allaah makes it easy for you to announce it publicly, by His leave. May Allaah help you to do that which is good.",Islam Q&A

Condolences are not like congratulations which people may be keen to offer whether the one who has been bereaved is sad or not. What is meant by offering condolences is that if you see a person who has been bereaved and his sorrow is plainly visible, you try to give him moral support and help him to bear that loss. This is the point of offering condolences. It is not something you do as a mere act of courtesy. If the people understood the purpose of offering condolences they would not go to the extreme of publishing them in the newspapers or gathering for that purpose or receiving people and offering them food, etc.","Shaykh Muhammad al-Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen ، 70 Su’aalan fi Ahkaam al-Janaa’iz, p. 53"

“Say: “O ‘Ibaadi (My slaves) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allah, verily, Allah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
And turn in repentance and in obedience with true Faith (Islamic Monotheism) to your Lord and submit to Him (in Islam) before the torment comes upon you, (and) then you will not be helped.
And follow the best of that which is sent down to you from your Lord (i.e. this Qur’aan, do what it orders you to do and keep away from what it forbids), before the torment comes on you suddenly while you perceive not!’”
[al-Zumar 39:53-54 – interpretation of the meaning]
I have received your letter and I was impressed with your eagerness to repent and come back to Allah, despite the fact that you have committed all kinds of haram actions, as you say, above all neglecting prayer. It is very important that you should know that the gate of repentance is open to you. You should think deeply about what is mentioned in the aayahs quoted above. I will also tell you some practical steps which will show you clearly how to repent, in sha Allah.
The word tawbah (repentance) is a great word with deep meaning. It is not, as many people think, merely words to be uttered whilst persisting in sin. Think about what Allah says:
“Seek the forgiveness of your Lord, and turn to Him in repentance”
[Hood 11:3 – interpretation of the meaning]
You will see that repentance is something more than seeking forgiveness.
Because this is a serious matter, there have to be conditions attached. The scholars mentioned the conditions of repentance, based on aayahs from the Qur’aan and ahaadeeth. There follows a list of some of them:
1 – Giving up the sin immediately.
2 – Regretting what has happened in the past.
3 – Resolving not to go back to it.
4 – Making amends to those whom you have wronged, or asking for their forgiveness.
You should not forget other important matters connected to sincere repentance, such as:
1 – You should give up the sin for the sake of Allah and not for any other reason such as not being able to do it or repeat it, or being afraid of what people will say, for example.
The person who gives up a sin because it may affect his standing or reputation among people, or because it may cost him his job, cannot be described as having repented.
The person who gives up sins for the sake of his health and strength cannot be described as having repented, such as a person who gives up zinaa (adultery) and immoral actions for fear of contagious deadly diseases, or for fear that they may weaken his body and his memory.
The person who refrains from taking a bribe for fear that it may be being offered by undercover officers cannot be described as having repented.
The person who gives up drinking alcohol and taking drugs because he has become bankrupt cannot be described as having repented.
Similarly, the person who is unable to commit sin because of something that lies beyond his control cannot be described as having repented, such as a liar who becomes paralyzed and loses the power of speech, or an adulterer who loses the ability to engage in intercourse, or a thief who has an accident and loses his limbs. In such cases, a person has to feel regret and stop wishing to commit sin, or he has to feel sorry for what has happened in the past. To someone like this the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Regret is repentance.” (narrated by Ahmad and Ibn Maajah; Saheeh al-Jaami’, 6802)
2 – He should feel repelled by the sin and the harm it causes.
This means that sincere repentance cannot be accompanied by feelings of enjoyment and pleasure when remembering past sins, or wishing to go back to it in the future.
In his book al-Daa’ wa’l-Dawaa’ wa’l-Fawaa’id, Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) mentioned many of the harmful effects of sin, including the following:
Being deprived of (Islamic) knowledge – feelings of alienation in the heart – difficulties – physical weakness – being unable to do acts of worship – being deprived of blessings – less help from Allah – anxiety – more bad deeds – getting used to sin – the sinner becomes insignificant in the sight of Allah – he becomes insignificant in the sight of people – the curse of the animals will be upon him – he will bear marks of humiliation – his heart will be sealed and he will come under the curse (of Allah) – his du’aa’ will not be answered – cause of mischief on land and sea – loss of gheerah (protective jealousy) – loss of modesty – the blessings of Allah will disappear – punishment will befall him – terror in the heart of the sinner – falling into the clutches of the Shaytaan – a bad end – punishment in the Hereafter.
Knowing these harmful effects of sin will make you want to keep away from sin altogether, but some people may move from one sin to another for a number of reasons, including the following:
- They think that it is less serious
- The self is more inclined towards it and the desire for it is stronger
- It is easier to commit this sin than others, unlike sins which require some preparation; the means of doing it are readily available and widespread
- His friends and companions are committing this sin and it is difficult for him to differ from them
- A particular sin may give a person some status among his companions, and it is too difficult for him to lose this position, so he continues to commit that sin.
3 – He should hasten to repent. Hence delaying repentance is in and of itself a sin for which repentance is required.
4 – You should make up the duties towards Allah that you have missed, if that is possible, such as paying the zakaah which you withheld in the past; and because this is something which is the right of the poor.
5 – You should keep away from places of sin if your being there may make you fall into sin again.
6 – You should keep away from those who helped you to commit sin.
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Friends on that Day will be foes one to another except Al-Muttaqoon (the pious)”
[al-Zukhruf 43:67]
Bad friends will curse one another on the Day of Resurrection, so you should keep away from them and break off your friendship with them, and warn others against them if you are not able to call them (to Allah). Do nt let the Shaytaan deceive you or make the idea of going back to them in order to call them to Allah look attractive to you, for you know that you are weak and will not be able to resist.
There are many cases in which people have gone back to sin because they resumed relationships with their former companions.
7 – Destroy haram things that you may have in your possession, such as intoxicants, musical instruments, haram pictures and movies, permissive stories, statues and so on. They should be broken, destroyed or burnt.
It is very essential that the one who wants to repent should rid himself of all items of jaahiliyyah. How often has it happened that keeping these haram things caused people who had repented to go back on their repentance and be led astray after having been guided. We ask Allah to make us steadfast.
8 – Choose righteous friends who will help you against your nafs (self) and who will be an alternative to bad company. Strive to attend circles of dhikr and gatherings of knowledge. Fill your time with beneficial things so that the Shaytaan will not find any opportunity to remind you of the past.
9 – Focus on your body which has been fed on haram substances and direct its energies towards obeying Allah. Seek out halaal substances with which to nourish your body so that your flesh will be renewed with halaal substances.
10 – Do a lot of good deeds, for good deeds cancel out bad deeds.
If you are sincere in your repentance to Allah, then receive the good news that all your previous evil deeds will be changed into good deeds. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And those who invoke not any other ilaah (god) along with Allah, nor kill such person as Allah has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse and whoever does this shall receive the punishment.
The torment will be doubled to him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace;
Except those who repent and believe (in Islamic Monotheism), and do righteous deeds; for those, Allah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful”
[al-Furqaan 25:68]
I ask Allah to benefit you by these words, and to guide your heart. Now get up and utter the Shahaadatyan, purify yourself (with ghusl) and pray as Allah has commanded you. Observe the Islamic duties regularly and give up haram things. I will be happy to help you in any way.
I ask Allah to give us and you strength to do that which He loves and is pleased with. May He accept the repentance of us all, for He is the One Who accepts repentance, the Most Merciful.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

They have seeds of corn with them which they scatter over the deceased, and I think they throw stones on the deceased. Can women visit graves?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.This is an innovation (bid’ah) for which there 
    is no basis in sharee’ah. Throwing seeds, perfume and clothes into the grave are all reprehensible actions for which there is no basis. The grave 
    should not be opened unless there is a good reason for doing so, such as the workers forgetting their tools like shovels, so it may be opened for 
    that reason, or if one of them has dropped something important, so the grave may be opened to retrieve it. But opening it to scatter seeds or 
    clothes and the like is not permitted. 
Women should not visit graves, because the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed women who visit graves. That was narrated from Abu Hurayrah, Ibn ‘Abbaas and 
    Hassaan ibn Thaabit (may Allaah be pleased with them). So it is not permissible for them to visit graves, but that is prescribed for men, because 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Visit the graves, for they remind you of the Hereafter.” (Narrated by Muslim 
    in his Saheeh). 
The reason why women are forbidden to visit

13993,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13993,Do Physical Appearances Really Matter?,I would like to ask a question that is a common problem among many of us. How does Allah look at physical beauty? How is it discussed in Hadith and Quran? Many people favor some of their children over others just because of light skin color or eye color. How does the Quran view this?,,,"Praise be to Allah.
Physical beauty is not considered to be a measure of virtue among people in 
Islam; rather the standard on which distinctions are made is taqwa (piety, fear 
of Allaah). Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O mankind! We have created you from a male and a female, and made you into 
nations and tribes, that you may know one another. Verily, the most honourable 
of you with Allaah is that (believer) who has At-Taqwa [i.e. he is one of the 
Muttaqoon (the pious)]. Verily, Allaah is All-Knowing, All-Aware”
[al-Hujuraat 49:13] 
Hence sharee’ah (divine law) came to correct our outlook which is usually based on outward appearances. There are many ahaadeeth (Prophetic narrations)on this topic, including the following: 
It was narrated in al-Saheeh that Abu Hurayrah said: “The Messenger of Allaah 
(peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Allaah does not look at your 
appearance or your wealth, but He looks at your hearts and your deeds.’” 
(Narrated by Muslim, al-Birr wa’l-Silah, 4651). 
It was narrated that Abu Dharr said: “I exchanged words with another man, whose 
mother was a non-Arab. I insulted his mother, and he mentioned that to the 
Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). He said to me, ‘Did you 
trade insults with so and so?’ I said, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘Did you insult his 
mother?’ I said, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘You are a man in whom is jaahiliyyah 
(ignorance)…’” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, al-Adab, 5590; Muslim, al-Eemaan, 
3140). According to another report: “…I said to him, ‘O son of a black woman’,” 
and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “In you there 
is jaahiliyyah” – i.e., one of the characteristics of jaahiliyyah. 
It was narrated that Sahl ibn Sa’d al-Saa’idi said: “A man passed by the 
Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and he asked a 
man who was sitting with him, ‘What do you think of this man?’ He said, ‘He is 
one of the nobility. By Allaah, if he proposes marriage he deserves to get 
married and if he intercedes, his intercession deserves to be accepted.’ The 
Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said nothing. 
Then another man passed by, and the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of 
Allaah be upon him) asked, ‘What do you think of this man?’ He said, ‘O 
Messenger of Allaah, he is one of the poor Muslims. If he proposes marriage he 
does not deserve to get married, if he intercedes his intercession does not 
deserve to be accepted and if he speaks he does not deserve to be heard.’ The 
Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘This one 
(the second man) is better than an earthful of (men like) that one (the first 
man).’” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, al-Riqaaq, 5966). 
It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of 
Allaah be upon him) said: “People should stop boasting about their forefathers 
who have died, for they are no more than the fuel of Hell, or they will be more 
insignificant before Allaah than the dung beetle which rolls up dung with its 
nose. Allaah has taken away your jaahili arrogance and pride in your ancestors; 
rather man is either a believer who fears Allaah or an immoral person who is 
doomed. All of them are the sons of Adam and Adam was created from dust.” 
(Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, al-Manaaqib, 3890; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in 
Saheeh Sunan al-Tirmidhi, no. 3100). 
All these ahaadeeth indicate that which we have mentioned above, which is that 
one’s appearance and colour should not be the basis of one’s feeling proud, 
distinguished, superior or of high status, and that the Muslim should get close 
to those who are pious and righteous. 
It was narrated that ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas said: “I heard the Prophet (peace and 
blessings of Allaah be upon him) saying out loud, not quietly: ‘…Rather my 
friends are Allaah and the righteous believers…’” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 
al-Adab, 5531; Muslim, al-Eemaan, 316). 
With regard to dealing with one’s children, it is obligatory to treat them 
fairly and not to prefer some of them over others, even if one of them honours 
his father more than another. So how about if the distinction is based on the 
colour of the child’s skin or the colour of his eyes? This is a serious matter 
and it is a grave wrongdoing. Parents have to fear Allaah when dealing with 
their children and treat them fairly. It says in the hadeeth whose authenticity

13994,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13994,The reality of belief in the Last Day,What is meant by belief in the Last Day?,,,"Praise be to Allah.What is meant by belief in the Last Day is: 
Firmly believing that everything that Allah has told us about in His Book and that His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has told us about what will happen after death, will indeed happen and come to pass. That includes believing in the signs of the Hour which will happen before the Last Day; in death and things that accompany it when a person is on his deathbed; what comes after death, namely the trial of the grave and torment or blessing therein; the Trumpet-blast and resurrection; the standing and terrors of the Day of Resurrection; the details of the gathering and reckoning; Paradise and its delights, the greatest of which will be looking upon the Face of Allah; Hell and its torments, the most severe of which will be their being veiled from seeing their Lord. And belief in the Last Day includes acting in accordance with what is implied by these beliefs. 
If this belief is firmly established in a person’s heart, it will bear great fruits, including the following: 
1 – The desire to do acts of obedience and worship, and to strive hard in doing so, in the hope of attaining the rewards of that Day. 
2 – Fear of committing sin or approving of it, for fear of the punishment of that Day. 
3 – The believer will be consoled for whatever he misses out on of worldly luxuries and delights, because of his hope for the delights and rewards of the Hereafter. 
We ask Almighty Allah to bless us with sincere belief and unshakeable certainty of faith… Ameen.

13995,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13995,He wants to make up the prayers for his wife when she has her period!,Should a woman pray for the missed prayers when she becomes clean after her periods? Also I would like if someone else can pray for a woman who is having her periods like a husband doing all the prayers twice one for himself and one for his wife. Please advice me?,,,"Praise be to Allah.When a woman has her period, she is spared the obligation of having to pray; indeed if a woman were to pray at that time she would be considered to be sinning and disobeying her Lord by doing so, and her prayers would not be accepted. 
Allaah has excused her from having to pray at the time of her period, and this is what is meant by the deficiency in her religious commitment as mentioned in the hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri who said, “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) went out and said: ‘O women… I have not seen anyone more deficient in intelligence and religion than you. A cautious sensible man could be led astray by some of you.’ The women asked, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, what is deficient in our religion and intelligence?’ He said, ‘Is not the evidence of one woman equal to half the testimony of one man?’ They said, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘This is the deficiency in her intelligence. Isn't it true that a woman can neither pray nor fast during her menses?’ The women said, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘This is the deficiency in her religion.’”
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, al-Hayd, 293; Muslim, al-Eemaan, 114). 
It was narrated that Mu’aadhah said: “I asked ‘Aa’ishah: ‘Why is it that a women who menstruates has to make up her fasts but not her prayers?’ She said, ‘That [menstruation] used to happen to us and we were commanded to make up our fasts but we were not commanded to make up our prayers.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, al-Hayd, 310; Muslim, al-Hayd, 508 – this version was narrated by him). 
Al-Nawawi said: “This ruling – i.e., that prayers should not be made up) is agreed upon by all the Muslims, that menstruating women and women who bleed following childbirth do not have to pray or fast at the times when prayers or fasts are due; they are unanimously agreed that they do not have to make up the prayers, and they are unanimously agreed that they do have to make up the fasts. The scholars said, the difference between them is that the prayers are many and are repeated, so it would be difficult to make them up, unlike the fasts.” 
(Sharh Muslim, 4/26) 
It was said that when a woman is menstruating, she is not obliged to perform the prayers at all, so it is not permissible for her to make up the prayers after she becomes pure (i.e., after her period ends). So how can someone else make up her prayers for her? Her husband does not need to make them up for her. This is apart from the fact that prayers cannot be made up for another person. ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “No one should pray on behalf of another.” 
Every Muslim should keep away from innovating something in the religion for which Allaah has not granted permission.

Hadiths about hijab","Praise be to Allah.Hijab in the Quran
Verses that have to do with hijab are as follows: 

Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts) and not to show off their adornment except only that which is apparent (like both eyes for necessity to see the way, or outer palms of hands or one eye or dress like veil, gloves, headcover, apron), and to draw their veils all over Juyubihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms) and not to reveal their adornment except to their husbands, or their fathers, or their husband’s fathers, or their sons, or their husband’s sons, or their brothers or their brother’s sons, or their sister’s sons, or their (Muslim) women (i.e. their sisters in Islam), or the (female) slaves whom their right hands possess, or old male servants who lack vigour, or small children who have no sense of feminine sex. And let them not stamp their feet so as to reveal what they hide of their adornment. And all of you beg Allah to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful.” [al-Nur 24:31] 

Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“And as for women past childbearing who do not expect wedlock, it is no sin on them if they discard their (outer) clothing in such a way as not to show their adornment. But to refrain (i.e. not to discard their outer clothing) is better for them. And Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower.” [al-Nur 24:60] 
“Women past childbearing” are those who no longer menstruate, so they can no longer get pregnant or bear children. 
We shall see below the words of Hafsah bint Sirin and the way in which she interpreted this verse. 

Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks (veils) all over their bodies (i.e. screen themselves completely except the eyes or one eye to see the way). That will be better, that they should be known (as free respectable women) so as not to be annoyed. And Allah is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [al-Ahzab 33:59] 

Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“O you who believe! Enter not the Prophet’s houses, unless permission is given to you for a meal, (and then) not (so early as) to wait for its preparation. But when you are invited, enter, and when you have taken your meal, disperse without sitting for a talk. Verily, such (behaviour) annoys the Prophet, and he is shy of (asking) you (to go); but Allah is not shy of (telling you) the truth. And when you ask (his wives) for anything you want, ask them from behind a screen, that is purer for your hearts and for their hearts. And it is not (right) for you that you should annoy Allah’s Messenger, nor that you should ever marry his wives after him (his death). Verily, with Allah that shall be an enormity.” [al-Ahzab 33:53] 
Hadiths about hijab
With regard to the Ahadith : 

It was narrated from Safiyyah bint Shaybah that ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) used to say: When these words were revealed – “and to draw their veils all over Juyubihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms)” – they took their izars (a kind of garment) and tore them from the edges and covered their faces with them. Narrated by al-Bukhari, 4481. 

The following version was narrated by Abu Dawud (4102): 
May Allah have mercy on the Muhajir women. When Allah revealed the words “and to draw their veils all over Juyubihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms)”, they tore the thickest of their aprons (a kind of garment) and covered their faces with them. 
Shaykh Muhammad al-Amin al-Shanqiti (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“This hadith clearly states that what the Sahabi women mentioned here understood from this verse – “and to draw their veils all over Juyubihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms)” – was that they were to cover their faces, and that they tore their garments and covered their faces with them, in obedience to the command of Allah in the verse where He said “and to draw their veils all over Juyubihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms)” which meant covering their faces. Thus the fair-minded person will understand that a woman's observing hijab and covering her face in front of men is established in the sahih Sunnah that explains the Book of Allah. ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) praised those women for hastening to follow the command of Allah given in His Book. It is known that their understanding of the words “and to draw their veils all over Juyubihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms)” as meaning covering the face came from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), because he was there and they asked him about everything that they did not understand about their religion. And Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And We have also sent down unto you (O Muhammad) the Dhikr [reminder and the advice (i.e. the Quran)], that you may explain clearly to men what is sent down to them, and that they may give thought” [al-Nahl 16:44] 
Ibn Hajar said in Fath al-Bari: There is a report of Ibn Abi Hatim via ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Uthman ibn Khaytham from Safiyyah that explains that. This report says: We mentioned the women of Quraysh and their virtues in the presence of ‘Aishah and she said: “The women of Quraysh are good, but by Allah I have never seen any better than the women of the Ansar, or any who believed the Book of Allah more strongly or had more faith in the Revelation. When Surat al-Nur was revealed – “and to draw their veils all over Juyubihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms)” – their menfolk came to them and recited to them what had been revealed, and there was not one woman among them who did not go to her apron, and the following morning they prayed wrapped up as if there were crows on their heads. It was also narrated clearly in the report of al-Bukhari narrated above, where we see ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her), who was so knowledgeable and pious, praising them in this manner and stating that she had never seen any women who believed the Book of Allah more strongly or had more faith in the Revelation. This clearly indicates that they understood from this verse – “and to draw their veils all over Juyubihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms)” – that it was obligatory to cover their faces and that this stemmed from their belief in the Book of Allah and their faith in the Revelation. It also indicates that women observing hijab in front of men and covering their faces is an act of belief in the Book of Allah and faith in the Revelation. It is very strange indeed that some of those who claim to have knowledge say that there is nothing in the Quran or Sunnah that says that women have to cover their faces in front of non-mahram men, even though the Sahabi women did that in obedience to the command of Allah in His Book, out of faith in the Revelation, and that this meaning is also firmly entrenched in the Sunnah, as in the report from al-Bukhari quoted above. This is among the strongest evidence that all Muslim women are obliged to observe hijab.” (Adwa al-Bayan, 6/594-595) 

‘Aishah narrated that the wives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to go out at night to al-Manasi’ (well known places in the direction of al-Baqi’) to relieve themselves and ‘Umar used to say to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “Let your wives be veiled.” But the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not do that. Then one night Sawdah bint Zam’ah, the wife of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), went out at ‘Isha time and she was a tall woman. ‘Umar called out to her: “We have recognized you, O Sawdah!” hoping that hijab would be revealed, then Allah revealed the verse of hijab. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 146; Muslim, 2170) 
Ibn Shihab narrated that Anas said: I am the most knowledgeable of people about hijab. Ubayy ibn Ka’b used to ask me about it. When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) married Zaynab bint Jahsh, whom he married in Madinah, he invited the people to a meal after the sun had risen. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sat down and some men sat around him after the people had left, until the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stood up and walked a while, and I walked with him, until he reached the door of ‘Aishah’s apartment. Then he thought that they had left so he went back and I went back with him, and they were still sitting there. He went back again, and I went with him, until he reached the door of ‘Aishah’s apartment, then he came back and I came back with him, and they had left. Then he drew a curtain between me and him, and the verse of hijab was revealed. (Al-Bukhari, 5149; Muslim, 1428)
‘Urwah narrated that ‘Aishah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to pray Fajr and the believing women would attend (the prayer) with him, wrapped in their aprons, then they would go back to their houses and no one would recognize them. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 365; Muslim, 645) 
‘Aishah narrated (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “The riders used to pass by us when we were with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in ihram, and when they drew near to us we would lower our jilbabs from our heads over our faces, then when they had passed we would uncover them again. (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 1833; Ibn Majah, 2935; classed as sahih by Ibn Khuzaymah (4,203) and by al-Albani in Kitab Jilbab al-Marah al-Muslimah) 
Asma bint Abi Bakr said: We used to cover our faces in front of men. (Narrated by Ibn Khuzaymah, 4/203; al-Hakim, 1/624. He classed it as sahih and al-Dhahabi agreed with him. It was also classed as sahih by al-Albani in Jilbab al-Marah al-Muslimah.) 
‘Asim al-Ahwal said: We used to enter upon Hafsah bint Sirin who had put her jilbab thus and covered her face with it, and we would say to her: May Allah have mercy on you. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And as for women past childbearing who do not expect wedlock, it is no sin on them if they discard their (outer) clothing in such a way as not to show their adornment” [al-Nur 24:60]. And she would say to us: What comes after that? We would say: “But to refrain (i.e. not to discard their outer clothing) is better for them”. And she would say: That is confirming the idea of hijab. (Narrated by al-Bayhaqi, 7/93)

This is what is indicated by the ahaadeeth.

 What one should do is to hasten to break the fast by eating small morsels that will calm one’s hunger, then get up to pray, then if one wishes, one may come back and eat more.
 This is what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to do. It was narrated that Anas ibn Maalik said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to break his fast before praying by eating fresh dates, and if there were no fresh dates he would eat dried dates; if there were no dried dates, he would have a few sips of water.” (al-Sawm, 632; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, no. 560)
