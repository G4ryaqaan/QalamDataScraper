Then why was it that Holy Prophet(pbuh) used to pray at that time, though it didn't cause any danger!?",,,"Praise be to Allah.When the sun was eclipsed at the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), he commanded someone to call out “al-salaatu jaami’ah (prayer is about to begin)”, and he led the people in prayer. Then he addressed them and explained to them the reason for the eclipse, and declared their jaahili beliefs to be null and void. He explained to them what they should do, such as praying and making du’aa’ and giving in charity. He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The sun and the moon are two of the signs of Allah; they do not become eclipsed for the death or life of anyone. If you see that then call upon Allah and magnify Him, and pray, and give in charity.” The Muslims did not know when an eclipse would happen, but when it did happen, they would hasten to do what Allah had prescribed, such as praying etc.
 When an eclipse happened, they would be afraid that is was a warning of impending disaster, so they would turn to Allah and pray to Him to ward off that which they feared. When astronomy and the calculations of the movements of the sun and moon became well known in later times, and it became known that the experts could know when an eclipse was likely to happen, the scholars (‘ulamaa’) pointed out that this did not change the ruling, and that the Muslims still had to do what they were commanded to do at the time of an eclipse, even if they knew about it in advance.But it is not prescribed to concern ourselves with the matter of predicting eclipses, because that is not what Allah and His Messenger commanded us to do. The scholars also explained that an eclipse may be a sign or a cause of something bad happening to people. When the questioner says that eclipses do not cause hrm, she is speaking without knowledge and objecting to the sharee’ah of Allah. People do not necessarily know of the events which Allah causes to happen at the time of an eclipse, and some people may know about that whilst others do not. It could be that because of the Muslims’ prayers, Allah wards off bad things which are known only to Him. The Muslim must submit to the ruling of Allah and act in accordance with His sharee’ah, and have faith in His wisdom, because He is the All-Knowing, All-Wise, may He be glorified and exalted.
 (Written by Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Barraak).
 Solar and lunar eclipses are two of the signs of Allah with which He scares His slaves and reminds them of some of the things which will happen on the Day of Resurrection, when the sun will be wound round and will lose its light and be overthrown and the stars will fall (cf. al-Takweer 81:1), and the sight will be dazed, the moon will be eclipsed and the sun and moon will be joined together (by going into one another, or folded up, or deprived of their light) (al-Qiyaamah 75:8-9). This is why Muslims should be alarmed by eclipses. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to fear Allah very much, and one day he came out in an agitated state, thinking that the Hour had begun, when the sun was eclipsed during his lifetime… This is indicative of the great extent to which he kept the Hour in mind and feared it. We, on the other hand, have become negligent and most people no longer think of eclipses as anything other than a natural phenomenon which they go out to watch with special glasses, carrying cameras. They limit themselves to the worldly scientific explanation without understanding the reminder of the Hereafter which it brings. This is one of the signs of hard-heartedness and a lack of concern about the matters of the Hereafter. It reflects a lack of fear of the onset of the Hour, and ignorance of the aims of sharee’ah and the reports that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to feel fear when these eclipses happened. The Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) used to stand to pray the eclipse prayer, because they believed that if indeed the Hour had come, they would not then be counted negligent of their prayer, and if this eclipse was nothing to do with the Hour, then they would not lose anything by praying, for they would have earned a great reward. We ask Allah to make us among those who fear Him and who are afraid of the Hour. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
5905,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/5905,The relationship between food and the person who eats it,"What is the reason why pork, wine and donkey meat are forbidden in Islam? Is there any relationship between the characteristics of foodstuffs and the nature of the person who eats them?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
The one who eats something takes on something of its characteristics in his attitude and actions. Just as there is wisdom in what Allah has created, there is also wisdom in what He has prescribed and commanded (sharee’ah). He has forbidden His slaves to eat unclean things because if they consume them, these things will become a part of them and they will be what they eat. When a person eats, he resembles what he eats, and what he eats becomes essentially a part of him. Hence man is more balanced in his attitude and behaviour than other animals because he is more balanced in what he eats. Eating blood and the flesh of carnivorous wild animals gives a person a wild, devilish character and makes him aggressive towards other people, so sharee’ah wisely forbids eating such foods except when there is an overwhelming reason to do so, such as absolute necessity. Because the Christians eat pork, it gives them a kind of harshness and cruelty. The same applies to those who eat the flesh of carnivores and dogs – they take on the character of these animals. A devilish attitude is an essential attribute of fanged carnivores, which is why they are forbidden as food by sharee’ah. Since camels may display such a devilish attitude, Islam commands those who eat camel meat to counteract it by doing wudoo’. Since a donkey-like attitude is an essential attribute of donkeys, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade us to eat them. Since blood is the vehicle of the Shaytaan through which he travels, Allah has absolutely forbidden us to eat blood.
Whoever ponders the wisdom of Allah in His creation and His commandments, and pays attention to both, will have opened an important door to the knowledge of Allah and His Names and Attributes.","Al-Tibyaan fi Aqsaam al-Qur’aan by Ibn al-Qayyim, 1/236"

      I live in a Jew house, but for a long time I'm learning about the islam and the quran.
      I think the Islam the the right way, and want to learn more about it and maybe to become a
      muslim. What to do?",,,"Praise be to Allah.You may be a young man for whom Allaah wills
    good. We admire you because, although you live in a Jewish family, you have been reading
    about Islam and the Quraan for some time, and you think that Islam is the true
    religion. All of this is a great achievement and an important step, for which you deserve
    to be encouraged. Your search for the truth at your age shows that your reasoning is
    strong and that your thinking is correct. So we congratulate you for the way in which you
    are thinking, and advise you to read more and to look at good Islamic sites on the
    Internet. On this site you will find a lot of information and answers to questions from
    people whose circumstances are similar to yours. Now let us look at the story of a Jewish
    youth who lived at the time of the Prophet of Islam, Muhammad 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him):
    From Anas (may Allâh be pleased with him): a young man from among the Jews used to serve
    the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). The boy became
    sick, and the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came to visit him
    when he was on his death-bed. He called him to Islam, and the boy looked at his father,
    who was standing by his head. His father said, Listen to Abul-Qaasim.
    [Abul-Qaasim (Father of al-Qaasim) was the kunya or nickname of the
    Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)  it is an Arab custom to
    address people as Father of and Mother of their oldest son 
    Translator]. So the boy became Muslim, then he died. The Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came away from him saying, Praise be to Allaah
    Who has saved him from the Hell-Fire. (Reported by Imaam Ahmad, 12896; also narrated
    in Saheeh al-Bukhaari, 1268). So go ahead and embrace Islam as your predecessor
    did, so that you will be saved from Hell and will earn the victory of Paradise as great as
    the heavens and the earth.
    We also want to present you with the following story which contains an important lesson
    and a moving account of a young man who looked for the truth, and was helped by Allaah to
    find it:
    Haddaab ibn Khaalid told us, Hammaad ibn Salamah told us, Thaabit told us from Abd
    al-Rahmaan ibn Abi Layla from Suhayb that the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: There was a king among the people who came
    before you who had a magician. When the magician grew old, he said to the king, I
    have grown old, so send me a boy to whom I can teach magic. So the king sent him a
    boy, and he taught him magic. On his way, the boy passed by a monk, so he sat with him and
    listened to him, and he liked what he said. When he came to the magician, he passed by the
    monk and sat with him, then when he came to the magician, he hit him because he was late.
    The boy complained about that to the monk, who said, If you are afraid of the
    magician, tell him, I was late because of my family and if you are afraid of
    your family, tell them, I was late because of the magician. Whilst this was
    going  on, he came across a huge beast that was blocking the peoples way. He
    said, Today I will know whether the monk is better or the magician. He picked
    up a stone and said, O Allâh, if the monks way is dearer to you than the
    magicians way, then kill this beast so that the people may go on their way.
    Then he threw the stone and killed the beast, and the people went on their way. He came to
    the monk and told him what had happened. The monk said to him, O my son, today you
    are better than I, you have reached such a level and now you will be tested. If you are
    put to the test, do not tell anyone about me. The young man began to heal the blind
    and the lepers, and to cure people from all kinds of sickness. One of the kings
    courtiers who had become blind heard about him, so he brought him many gifts and said,
    Whatever I have piled up here is for you, if you heal me. The boy said,
    I do not heal anyone, it is Allaah who heals. If you believe in Allaah and call on
    Allaah, He will heal you. So he believed in Allaah and and Allaah healed him. Then
    he came to the king and sat with him as he had always done. The king said to him,
    Who gave you back your sight? He said, My Lord. The king said,
    Do you have any lord other than me? He said, My Lord and your Lord is
    Allaah. So the king took him and kept touring him until he told him about the boy.
    So the boy was brought to the king, who said, O my son, I have heard about your
    magic, that you heal the blind and the leper, and you do such and such. The boy
    said, I do not heal anyone, it is Allaah Who heals. The took him and tortured
    him until he told him about the monk. The monk was brought and was told, Give up
    your religion, and he refused. So a saw was brought and placed on the top of his
    head, and he was cut in two. Then the kings courtier was brought and was told,
    Give up your religion, and he refused. So a saw was brought and placed on the
    top of his head, and he was cut in two. Then the boy was brought and was told, Give
    up your religion, and he refused. The king gave him to a group of his companions and
    said, Take him to such and such a mountain, and take him up the mountain. When you
    reach the top of the mountain, if he gives up his religion (then leave him alone),
    otherwise throw him down. So they took him up the mountain, and the boy said, O
    Allaah, protect me from them in whatever manner You wish. So the mountain was shaken
    and they fell down, and the boy came walking back to the king. The king asked, What
    happened to your companions? He said, Allaah protected me from them.
    Then the king gave him to another group of his companions, and said, Take him and
    put him on a ship, then take him to the middle of the sea. If he gives up his religion
    (then leave him alone), otherwise throw him overboard. So they took him and he said,
    O Allaah, protect me from them in whatever manner You wish. The boat was
    turned upside down and they drowned, and the boy came walking back to the king. The king
    asked, What happened to your companions? He said, Allaah protected me
    from them. The boy said to the king: You will not be able to kill me unless
    you do what I tell you. The king said, What is that then? He said,
    Gather the people together in one place and crucify me on a tree-trunk, then take an
    arrow from my quiver and put it in your bow. Then say, In the name of Allaah, the
    Lord of the boy and shoot me. If you do that, you will kill me. So the king
    gathered the people in one place, crucified the boy on a tree-trunk, took an arrow from
    his quiver and placed it in his bow. Then he said, In the name of Allaah, the Lord
    of the boy and shot him. The arrow hit his temple (the side of his head), and he put
    his hand on the side of his head where he had been hit, and died. The people said,
    We believe in the Lord of the boy, we believe in the Lord of the boy, we believe in
    the Lord of the boy. Someone came to the king and said, Do you see what you
    were afraid of? By Allâh, what you were afraid of has happened to you now. So he
    ordered that ditches should be dug at the intersections of the streets, and they were dug
    and fires were lit in them. Then he said, Whoever does not give up his religion,
    throw him into them or it was said, Throw yourselves in. They did this
    until they came to a woman who had a baby with her. She felt scared to throw herself in,
    but the infant said to her, O mother, have patience, for you are on the right
    path. (Reported by Muslim in his Saheeh, 5327).
    After telling this moving story about a boy coming to know the truth and believe in it and
    adhere to it, we would like to say to you if you think that your family will give you a
    hard time if you become Muslim, then you can keep your Islam secret and do your prayers in

        al-Naysapoori. He was a poet and philosopher from among the people of Naysapoor, where he
        was born and died.
He was born in 408 AH, in the town of Naysapoor, where he died and was
        buried in 517 AH, or it was said, 515 AH.
He was a scholar who was well versed in mathematics, astronomy,
        language, fiqh and history.
Because of his brilliance as an astronomer, he was appointed as director
        of the observatory in Baghdaad, and because of his interest in philosophy, his name is
        associated with that of Ibn Seenaa (Avicenna), who wrote articles filled with kufr which
        put him beyond the pale of Islam.
He is also famous for his poetry, the best known of which is al-Rubaa’iyaat,
        which is filled with ideas of kufr, promiscuity and heresy. No wonder the West took such
        an interest in publishing and distributing this book! It has been translated into many
        languages, such as English, French, Russian, German, etc. The British sought to spread the
        ideas of immorality and promiscuity advocated by al-Khayyaam in al-Rubaa’iyaat,
        so they spread it in the countries which they colonized, such as India and Iran, and
        attributed it to one of the Muslims, rather one of the greatest of them – or so they
        claimed.
One of the verses about wine – in al-Rubaa’iyaat –
        says:
Drink wine, for it is the relaxation of the soul
A cure for the soul and heart, and entertainment.
If you are overwhelmed with stress and grief,
Save yourself through it, for it is like the ship of Nooh.
Denying the idea of resurrection after death, he said:
Get up before death seizes you
And take the rose-coloured (liquid) [i.e., wine] to expel darkness
O fool, you are not a piece of gold
To be buried and later brought forth
His words of promiscuity and immorality include the following:
As much as you can, follow the people of immorality
Destroy the structure of fasting and prayer
Receive the best words from al-Khayyaam
Drink, sing and pursue the good things
His mocking of the sharee’ah, his insolence towards his Lord and
        his attitude towards repentance may be seen in the following words:
Every day I have the intention to repent
If night falls and I feel that I want to repent from drinking wine
Then the season of flowers comes and then,
O Lord, I repent from my intention to repent
Some researchers, such as al-Zarkali, said that later he repented and
        performed Hajj. Others, such as ‘Abd al-Haqq Faadil, expressed doubts about the
        attribution of al-Rubaa’iyaat to him.
Whatever the case, the Rubaa’iyaat do not indicate that he
    repented, because they contain clear statements of kufr, wilful neglect of virtuous
    attributes and rejection of the idea of repenting and turning to Allaah. Indeed, they
    contain no indication that their author believed in Allaah and the Last Day.
The doubts about whether he wrote these words are outweighed by number
    of people who attributed them to him. Allaah knows best what is really the case.

    Some answers Please! God bless you!",,,"Praise be to Allah.According to Islam and for the Muslims,
    taking a position of enmity is not something haphazard. On the contrary, it is governed by
    principles and guidelines, and thus is like all the other rulings of Islamic sharee'ah.
    These principles and guidelines come from Allaah, Who is above having any shortcomings and
    to Whom belong the Most Beautiful Names and Sublime Attributes. The sources of rulings for
    us are the Qur'aan and the proven Saheeh (authentic) Sunnah (the words and deeds of the
    Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)). The Qur'aan and Sunnah brought a
    clear message and ideology, which is the belief in Tawheed (Divine Unity) based on the
    testimony that there is no god except Allaah, and Muhammad 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah
    be upon him) is the Messenger of Allaah, the Seal of the Prophets [i.e., the final
    Prophet] and the Imaam (or leader) of the Messengers. We do not associate any other god in
    worship with Allaah; on the contrary, we regard Him as Unique in His Divinity and
    Lordship, and in His Names and Attributes. We do not claim that He has any spouse or son.
    We take as friends those whom Allaah takes as friends, and regard as enemies those whom He
    regards as enemies. We hate those who slander Him and attribute to Him a wife or son, for
    Allaah is Unique, He is the One, the Self-Sufficient Master, Who begets not nor was He
    begotten, and He has no wife or son. Glory be to Him, how can He have a child? To Him
    belongs all that is in the heavens and on earth. He has no partner and He does not need
    children as human beings do. He is the Creator of the father and of what the father
    begets. Muslims follow the commands of Allaah and have no choice with regard to His rules
    and regulations, rather they adhere to the rulings of Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation
    of the meaning):
    ""It is not for a believer, man or woman, when Allaah and His Messenger have decreed a
    matter that they should have any option in their decision. And whoever disobeys Allaah and
    His Messenger, he has indeed strayed into a plain error"" [al-Ahzaab 33:36]
    Among these rulings is that we should love for the sake of Allaah and hate for the sake of
    Allaah.
    But there is also plenty of room for debate with the Muslims; indeed, in His Book Allaah
    commanded the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his ummah (nation)
    after him to engage in debate and dialogue with the People of the Book, i.e., Jews and
    Christians. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):""Say (O Muhammad 
): 'O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians): Come to a
    word that is just between us and you, that we worship none but Allaah (Alone), and that we
    associate no partners with Him, and that none of us shall take others as lords besides
    Allaah.' Then, if they turn away, say: 'Bear witness that we are Muslims.'"" [Aal
    'Imraan 3:64]
    We believe in Jesus ('Eesa) - peace be upon him - as a Prophet sent by Allaah, but God
    forbid that we should describe Jesus as a god or lord as the Christians claim, and fail to
    distinguish between the Messenger and the One Who sent him, between the Creator and His
    creation. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
    ""And (remember) when Allaah will say (on the Day of Resurrection): 'O 'Eesa
    (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary)! Did you say unto men: 'Worship me and my mother as two gods
    besides Allaah?' He will say: 'Glory be to You! It was not for me to say what I had no
    right (to say). Had I said such a thing, You would surely have known it. You know what is
    in my inner-self though I do not know what is in Yours; truly, You, only You, are the
    All-Knower of all that is hidden (and unseen). Never did I say to them aught except what
    You (Allaah) did command me to say: ""Worship Allaah, my Lord and your Lord."" And
    I was a witness over them while I dwelt amongst them, but when You took me up, You were
    the Watcher over them; and You are a Witness to all things.' (This is a great admonition
    and warning to the Christians of the whole world)."" [al-Maa'idah 5:116-117].
    And Allaah says - addressing you and your fellow-Christians, and you will be blessed if
    you respond - (interpretation of the meaning):""O people of the Scripture (Christians)! Do not exceed the limits in your
    religion, nor say of Allaah aught but the truth. The Messiah 'Eesa (Jesus), son of Maryam
    (Mary), was (no more than) a Messenger of Allaah and His Word, ('Be!' - and he was) which
    He bestowed on Maryam (Mary) and a spirit (Rooh) created by Him; so believe in Allaah and
    His Messengers. Say not: 'Three (trinity)!' Cease! (it is) better for you. For Allaah is
    (the only) One Ilaah (God), glory is to Him (Far Exalted is He) above having a son. To Him
    belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. And Allaah is
    All-Sufficient as a Disposer of affairs."" [al-Nisaa' 4:171]
    Islam is the religion of guidance, mercy and love, but there are people who force the
    Muslims to fight when they stand in the way of their conveying the guidance to mankind.
    The Muslims do not fight anyone until they have told them about the religion of Allaah and
    given them the choice between two things, either accepting Islam or, if they refuse Islam
    and keep their own religions, paying the Jizyah (tax) to the Muslims in return for
    protection. If they refuse both of these choices, then they are to be fought.
    When we Muslims fight, it is for the sake of saving people from worshipping other people,
    and teaching them to worship the Lord of the Worlds, and bringing them out of the
    injustice of other religions to the justice of Islam, and freeing them from the
    constrictions of this world so that they may enjoy the bounty of this world and the
    Hereafter.
    We believe that Jesus ('Eesa) - peace be upon him - did not die, but Allaah took him up to
    Himself. Jesus will come back to this world at the end of time and will rule according to
    Islam. The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
    ""Jesus will descend to Damascus, by the white minaret."" (Narrated by Abu Dawood,
    4/117; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani, may Allaah have mercy on him).
    Islam cancels out the messages that came before it, and Allaah will not accept any other
    religion from anyone who comes to know of Islam during his lifetime. If people submit in
    Islam to the Lord of the Worlds, follow the Best of the Messengers, Muhammad 
 (peace and
    blessings of Allaah be upon him), and do righteous deeds, then Allaah will be pleased with
    them and will bless them with a good life in this world and the next. Allaah says
    (interpretation of the meaning):
    ""Whoever works righteousness - whether male or female - while he (or she) is a
    true believer (of Islâmic Monotheism) verily, to him We will give a good life (in this
    world with respect, contentment and lawful provision), and We shall pay them certainly a
    reward in proportion to the best of what they used to do (i.e. Paradise in the
    Hereafter)."" [al-Nahl 16:97]
    We hope that we have answered your questions. We ask Allaah to guide us all and help us
    all to follow the truth. Peace be upon those who follow true guidance.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
5979,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/5979,Too much debt,"I have indebted myself to the point to where I cannot remember all the people I owe money or the amounts. What do I do to solve or make expiation, and when will I be able to make Hajj and the debt not cause it to be rejected?",,,"Praise be to Allah.There are two aspects to this question.
Firstly: what can you do to solve this problem?
Secondly: when can you go for Hajj without the debts leading to your Hajj being rejected?
With regard to the first issue: try to pay off your debts to the people you know about. Whoever asks you to pay back the debt and has proof that you owe him, or you can remember that you owe him, pay him back. If you know that you owe somebody and how much you owe him, but you cannot find him, or you know the amount you owe but you do not know to whom it is owed, then give that amount in charity on that person's behalf. If he comes along later, give him the choice between approving of the charity and gaining the reward for it, or asking you to pay him back, in which case the reward (for giving charity) will be yours.
With regard to the second issue: if you want to go for Hajj, then you can either pay off your debts, especially those where you know how much is owed to whom, or you can ask for their permission and then go for Hajj. May Allaah help you and make it easy for you to pay off your debts and fulfil your duties.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

    something haraam – should he repay it?","Is it permissable for someone to
      repay a debt on something that was haram?jazakallah khairyn.",,,"Praise be to Allah.He should look at this forbidden thing and if the
    transaction was with a Muslim, then it is not permissible for him to pay the debt, because
    when Allaah forbids a thing He also forbids its price, and because whatever it is
    forbidden to sell in Islam has no price. The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be
    upon him) forbade the price of a dog and said: “If he comes asking for its price,
    then fill his palm with dust.” This is reported in Al-Saheeh from the hadeeth
    of Ibn Abbaas.
It was reported from Abu Mas’ood al-Ansaari (may Allaah be pleased
    with him) that the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)
    forbade the price of a dog, the earnings of a prostitute and the fee (hulwaan) of a
    fortune-teller (narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2083). The word hulwaan
    comes from the phrase “halawtuhu hulwaanan”, meaning “I gave it to
    him”; the root of this word is al-halaawah (meaning “sweet”) and it
    is likened to something sweet because he takes the money so easily, without having to work
    hard or make any effort… Hulwaan also means “bribe.”
    But if a person is forced to repay the debt, then in this case he
    should pay it whilst seeking the forgiveness of Allaah and repenting to Him for buying
    haraam things, whether from a Muslim or anyone else.
If the transaction was with a non-Muslim in whose religion the thing he
    sold is not viewed as forbidden, then the debt has to be paid whilst also repenting. The
    Muslim has to avoid dealing in things that Allaah has forbidden.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
5981,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/5981,Will a woman be    with her husband in Paradise?,"A question that we hear often is with regards to men and women in the Hereafter; can you tell us something (according to Quran and Sunnah) regarding where the women will be with respect to their husbands. In other words, will a woman be with her husband in Jannah? Will he/she or both have a choice as to whether or not they want to be together?",,,"Praise be to Allah.1.Yes, a woman will be with her husband in Paradise, and even with her children, sons and daughters, if they are Muslim. This is indicated by the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):
“And those who believe and whose offspring follow them in Faith, - to them shall We join their offspring, and We shall not decrease the reward of their deeds in anything.” [al-Toor 52:21]
It is also indicated by the du’aa’ of the angels who carry the Throne:
“Our Lord! And make them enter the ‘Adn (Eden) Paradise (everlasting Gardens) which you have promised them and to the righteous among their fathers, their wives, and their offspring! Verily, You are the All-Mighty, the All-Wise” [Ghaafir 40:8 – interpretation of the meaning]
Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
“(This means) bring them together so that they may find delight in one another in neighbouring dwellings. This is like the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):
‘And those who believe and whose offspring follow them in Faith, - to them shall We join their offspring, and We shall not decrease the reward of their deeds in anything.’ [al-Toor 52:21] This means: We shall make them all equal in status so that they may find joy. This will not be by lowering the one who is higher in status until he is equal with the one who is lower; on the contrary, We shall raise the one who is lacking in good deeds and make them equal, as a bounty and a blessing from Us. Sa’eed ibn Jubair said: when the believer enters Paradise, he will ask about his father, son and brother and where they are. It will be said to him, they did not reach the same level of good deeds as you did. He will say, But I only strove for my sake and for theirs. Then they will be brought to join him on the level where he is.”
(Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 4/73)
2. We do not think that anyone who Allah has decreed will enter Paradise and have all trace of hatred taken away from them will choose to be separated from a loved one when he or she meets them in the Hereafter.
3. If a woman does not get married in this world, Allah will grant her a spouse in whom she will find delight in Paradise. The joys of Paradise are not limited only to males – they are for males and females alike, and part of that joy is marriage.”
(Majmoo’ Fatawaa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 2/53), There will be no single people in Paradise.

5983,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/5983,A wife refusing    her husband a co-wife,Is there any ruling that says in a marraige contract that a wife can refuse her husband a co-wife?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his book Al-Mughni:
“If he married her on the condition that he should not make her move from her house or her city, then this condition is valid, because it was reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘The most deserving of conditions to be fulfilled are those by means of which sexual intercourse becomes permissible for you.’ If he married her on the condition that he will not marry another wife, then she has the right to leave him if he does take another wife.” In conclusion, then, the conditions of the marriage contract are divided into three types, one of which must be adhered to, which is of benefit to the wife, such as her being able to stipulate that he cannot make her move from her house or city, or travel with him, or take another wife or a concubine. He has to adhere to these conditions, and if he does not, then she has the right to annul the marriage.” (Al-Mughni by Ibn Qudaamah, part 7, Kitaab al-Nikaah).
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked this question and he replied in Al-Fataawa al-Kubra:
“Question: a man married a woman and she stipulated that he should not take another wife or make her move from her house, and that she could stay with her mother, so he married her on this basis. Does he have to adhere to this, and if he goes against these conditions, does his wife have the right to annul the marriage or not?
Answer: yes, these conditions and similar ones are valid according to the madhhab of Imaam Ahmad and other scholars among the Sahaabah and Taabi’een, such as ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab, ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas, Shurayh al-Qaadi, al-Oozaa’i and Ishaaq. According to the madhhab of Maalik, the condition states that if he marries another wife, (the first wife) has the choice of what to do, and this is a valid condition. The woman has the right to leave him in this case. This is similar to the idea in the Madhhab of Imaam Ahmad. The basis for this is the hadeeth narrated by (al-Bukhaari and Muslim) in al-Saheehayn from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): ‘The most deserving of conditions to be fulfilled are those by means of which sexual intercourse becomes permissible for you.’ ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab said: ‘Rights are in accordance with conditions.’ The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) dictated that the conditions which make sexual intercourse permissible are more deserving of fulfilment than others.

Was she a good Muslim at her early years? Why did she become an ascetic?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Raabi’ah al-‘Adawiyyah was an ascetic and humble
      worshipper, as al-Dhahabi said in al-Siyar (8/241). Abu Sa’eed
      ibn al-A’raabi reported that he said:
 With regard to Raabi’ah al-‘Adawiyyah, people
      transmitted a great deal of wisdom from her. Sufyaan, Shu’bah and others
      reported about her accounts which prove that what was said about her
      believing in incarnation and promoting promiscuity is not true.
 Al-Dhahabi said: this is an exaggeration and
      ignorance. Perhaps those who attribute that to her are themselves
      promiscuous and believers in incarnation, and are using her to support
      their own kufr, just as they misuse the hadeeth “I will be hishearing with which he hears.”
 There are no reports of miracles etc. on the part
      of Raabi’ah al-‘Adawiyyah; there are only the reports of her words of
      asceticism and wisdom, such as when she said to Sufyaan al-Thawri: “You
      are only a few days, and when one day passes a part of you has gone. Soon,
      when a part of you have gone all of you will have gone. You know about
      this, so act upon it.”
 Another example of the things she said is: “I
      seek forgiveness from Allaah for the lack of my sincerity when I say, I
      seek the forgiveness of Allaah.”
 ‘Abdah bint Abi Shawwaal, who was one of the
      best female slaves of Allaah and who used to serve Raabi’ah, said:
      “Raabi’ah used to pray all night long, and just before dawn, she would
      take a short nap until dawn came. When she awoke with a start, I would
      hear her say in a terrified manner, ‘O my soul, how long will you sleep?
      How long will you nap? Soon you will sleep a sleep from which you will not
      wake until the Day of Resurrection.’”
 She [‘Abdah] said: this was her habit all her
      life, until she died.
 It was said that she lived for eighty years and
      died in the year 180 AH.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
