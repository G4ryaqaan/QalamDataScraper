Do I have to do ghusl again or not? Please advise us, may Allah reward you.","If the drops of blood are very few and this does not happen every month, but it happens sometimes and it is not pure blood but is yellowish or brownish, then this does not count as anything and you do not have to repeat the ghusl.",,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: if your regular period has ended, what you saw was yellowish or brownish , so you should not count this as anything. Rather you should fast and pray, because of the hadith of Umm `Atiyyah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: “We used not to count the yellowish and brownish discharge that appeared after becoming pure as anything.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1/426). 
This is when the period has finished. But if the yellowish or brownish discharge appears during the time of the period, then it is part of the period. For example, if your period lasts seven days, and on the fifth day the bleeding stops and you see a yellowish or brownish discharge , this is part of your period and you should not pray or fast.
 If what you describe happens every month, then you should do ghusl when it stops and you see that you are pure. If the drops are very few and it does not happen every month, but it happens sometimes and it is not pure blood but is yellowish or brownish, then this does not count as anything and you do not have to repeat the ghusl. If it is there it is the same as if it is not there; do ghusl when you see that you are pure.

9205,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9205,Buying permissible things in places where haraam things are being sold,"Is it permissible for a Muslim to buy halaal meat from a place where haraam meat is also sold, if the meat (both kinds) is prepared separately and stored in separate refrigerators? Is it permissible to buy halaal foods from large stores which also sell alcohol in a separate section of the store and the owner of the store is not Muslim?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Allaah
      says (interpretation of the meaning):
      
      
“Help
      you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwa (virtue, righteousness
      and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression’
      [al-Maa’idah 5:2]
      
      
 So
      it is not permissible for a Muslim to help anyone in doing anything that
      involves sin and transgression and violating the limits set by Allaah. So
      if a Muslim is in a position where he has the choice and it is easy for
      him to find someone who sells only halaal foods and keeps away from haraam
      things such as pork etc., then he should deal with that person and not
      with the one who sells both halaal and haraam such as pork, alcohol and so
      on. But if that is not possible, then it is permissible for the Muslim to
      buy halaal meat and permissible foods from him so long as the distinction
      between what is halaal and what is haraam is clear, because Allaah says
      (interpretation of the meaning):
      
      
“So
      keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you can “ [al-Taghaabun

9208,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9208,Are Wet Dreams Haram?,"My question deals with wet dreams. I restrain myself to the best of my ability from pleasuring myself, however in doing so, I get wet dreams, what is the ruling of such, is it haram, what can I do to prevent such, it's quite embarrassing.","A wet dream is a means of expending sexual energy for both sexes. A person plays no role in that, rather it happens as a result of human nature and a person will not be held to blame for that. So, wet dreams are something natural, and they cannot be gotten rid of.",,"Praise be to Allah.Allah has created desire in man and He has commanded His slaves to use this energy in the proper manner, which is marriage for those who can afford it, in order to attain worldly interests such as building families, strengthening society and populating the earth according to the laws of Allah. 
Moreover one of the ways which Allah has created in His slaves as an outlet for this energy is wet dreams . It is a means of expending sexual energy for both sexes. A person plays no role in that, rather it happens as a result of human nature and a person will not be held to blame for that. The evidence for that is as follows: 
`Ali narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The Pen has been lifted from three : from the one who is sleeping until he wakes up, from the child until he reaches the age of puberty, and from one who is insane until he comes to his senses.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1343; Ibn Majah, 3032; al-Nasai, 3378) 
A similar hadith was also narrated from `Aishah in the four books of Sunan apart from al-Tirmidhi. 
This hadith was classed as hasan by al-Tirmidhi, and by al-Nawawi in Sharh Muslim, 8/14. 
A person who is sleeping does not know what he is doing, so he is one of those from whom the Pen is lifted (i.e., his deeds are not recorded). Wet dreams happen when a person is asleep, so they are among the things that are forgiven. 

Allah has in fact made wet dreams [al-hilm] one of the signs of puberty . Hence Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“And when the children among you come to puberty [al-hilm]…” [Al-Nur 24:59]
If wet dreams were haram, Allah would not have made that a sign of puberty. 

Zaynab, the daughter of Umm Salamah, narrated that Umm Salamah said: “Umm Sulaym came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, Allah is not too shy to tell us the truth. Does a woman have to do ghusl if she has a wet dream?’ The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Yes, if she sees water (a discharge).’ Umm Salamah covered her face and said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, can a woman have an erotic dream? ’ He said, ‘Yes, may your hands be rubbed with dust. How else would her child resemble her?’” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 130; Muslim, 313) 
`Aishah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was asked about a man who notices some wetness but does not remember having a wet dream. He said, “He should do ghusl.” He was asked about a man who thinks that he had an erotic dream but does not see any wetness. He said, “He does not have to do ghusl.” Umm Salamah said, “O Messenger of Allah, does a woman have to do ghusl if she sees something like that?” He said, “Yes, women are the twin halves of men.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 113; Abu Dawud, 236) 

Al-‘Ajlani said: “Ibn Qattan said: its isnad via `Aishah is weak but its isnad via Anas is sahih (sound).” (Kashf al-Khafa, 1/ 248) 
In conclusion, wet dreams are something natural, and they cannot be gotten rid of. The matter is not as embarrassing as you imagined.

Virtues of Friday 


What to read in Fajr prayer on Friday","Praise be to Allah.Importance of Friday
Friday has many distinguishing features and virtues that Allah has bestowed upon this day and not others. 
Abu Hurayrah and Hudhayfah (may Allah be pleased with them) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah led those who came before us away from Friday. The Jews had Saturday, and the Christians had Sunday. Then Allah brought us and Allah guided us to Friday. So there is Friday, Saturday and Sunday, and thus they will follow us on the Day of Resurrection. We are the last of the people of this world but we will be the first on the Day of Resurrection, and we will be dealt with before all others.” (Narrated by Muslim, 856) 
Al-Nawawi said: 
“Al-Qadi said: The apparent meaning is that it was obligatory for them to venerate Friday but this was not stated clearly; the matter was left to their own reasoning… But they did not manage to work it out and Allah did not guide them to it. It was enjoined clearly upon this ummah, and was not left to their own reasoning, thus they were blessed with it … It was narrated that Musa enjoined Friday upon them and told them of its virtues, but they disputed with him and argued that Saturday was better, and it was said to him, ‘Let them be.’ Al-Qadi said: if there had been a clear command, their arguing with him would not have been valid, rather it would have been said to him that they were going against the command. I say: it may be that that was clearly enjoined upon them but they disputed as to whether it was something they had to adhere to or they could change it to another day; they decided to change it to another day and they erred greatly thereby.” 
It comes as no surprise that Friday was specifically enjoined upon them and they went against that. 
Al-Hafiz said: “How can it be otherwise when they are the ones who said “We hear and we disobey”? 
Aws ibn Aws narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of your days is Friday. On that day Adam (peace be upon him) was created; on that day he died; on that day the Trumpet will be blown and on that day all of creation will swoon. So send a great deal of blessings upon me, for your blessings will be shown to me.” They said, “O Messenger of Allah, how will our blessings upon you be shown to you when you have turned to dust?” He said, “Allah has forbidden the earth to consume the bodies of the Prophets, peace be upon them.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 1047; classed as sahih by Ibn al-Qayyim in his comments on Sunan Abi Dawud, 4/273; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud, 925) 
Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The best day on which the sun rises is Friday. On it Adam was created, on it he was admitted to Paradise and on it he was expelled therefrom.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1410) 
This hadith includes some of the reasons why Friday is regarded as special.  
Al-Nawawi said: 
“Al-Qadi ‘Iyad said: The apparent meaning is that these virtues do not mean that Friday is regarded as special because Adam was expelled on a Friday and the Hour will begin on a Friday. Rather it is meant to explain what momentous events took place and will take place on this day, so that people will make the most of this day to do righteous deeds, so as to attain the mercy of Allah and ward off His punishment.  This is the view of al-Qadi. Abu Bakr ibn al-‘Arabi said in his book al-Ahwadhi fi Sharh al-Tirmidhi: All of these events are good and add to the virtue of Friday. The expulsion of Adam from Paradise is the reason why his offspring and the messengers, the prophets, the righteous and the awliya exist. He was not expelled from it as such, but rather it was for a purpose, then he will return to it. With regard to the Hour beginning on a Friday, the reason is so that the reward may be hastened for the prophets, believers in truth, awliya and others, and their honour and high status may be made manifest. This hadith points to the virtues of Friday and its high status in relation to the other days.”  
Abu Lubabah ibn ‘Abd al-Mundhir said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Friday is the master of days, and the greatest of them before Allah. It is greater before Allah than the day of al-Adha and the day of al-Fitr. It has five characteristics: on this day Allah created Adam, on it He sent Adam down to the earth, on it Allah caused Adam to die, on it there is a time when a person does not ask Allah for anything but He gives it to him, so long as he does not ask for anything haram, and on it the Hour will begin. There is no angel who is close to Allah, no heaven, no earth, no wind, no mountain and no sea that does not fear Friday.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah, 1084; classed as hasan by Shaykh al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami’, no. 2279)
Al-Sanadi said:  
“They fear Friday” means they fear the onset of the Hour. This indicates that all created beings are aware of the days and they know that the Day of Resurrection will come on a Friday. 
Virtues of Friday 
The virtues of Friday include the following: 
·        On it is Salat al-Jumu`ah (Friday prayer), which is the best of prayers. 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe (Muslims)! When the call is proclaimed for the Salah (prayer) on Friday (Jumu‘ah prayer), come to the remembrance of Allah [Jumu‘ah religious talk (Khutbah) and Salah (prayer)] and leave off business (and every other thing). That is better for you if you did but know!” [Al-Jumu`ah 62:9]
Muslim (233) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The five daily prayers and from one Jumu’ah to the next is an expiation for whatever sins come in between them, so long as one does not commit a major sin.” 
·        Praying Fajr in congregation on Fridays is the best prayer that the Muslim can pray during the week. 
Ibn `Umar said: The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The best prayer before Allah is Fajr prayer on Friday in congregation.” (Narrated by al-Bayhaqi in Shu’ab al-Iman; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami’, 1119) 
What to read in Fajr prayer on Friday
One of the special features of Fajr prayer on Friday is that it is Sunnah to recite Surat al-Sajdah in the first rak`ah and Surat al-Insan in the second . 
Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to recite in Fajr prayer in Fridays Alif-Lam-Mim Tanzil (Surat al-Sajdah) in the first rak’ah and Hal ata ‘ala’l-insan hinun min al-dahr lam yakun shay-an madhkuran (Surat al-Insan) in the second. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 851; Muslim, 880) 
Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar said: 
It was said that the reason why these two surahs are recited is because they mention the creation of Adam and what will happen on the Day of Resurrection, because that will come to pass on a Friday. 
·        Whoever dies during the day or night of Friday , Allah will protect him from the trial of the grave. 
`Abd-Allah ibn `Amr said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no Muslim who dies during the day of Friday or the night of Friday but Allah will protect him from the trial of the grave.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1074; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Ahkam al-Janaiz, p. 49, 50) 
These are some of the virtues of Friday. We ask Allah to help us to please Him.

9222,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9222,She had a tattoo done before she became Muslim. Is she cursed?,"Before I converted to Islam, I got tatooed. I have recently read about a tatooed women being a cursed woman.

Does this apply to me as well? If I become engaged, should I tell my husband about this before hand, in case he does not want to become engaged to a ""cursed woman""?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The Muslim 
    must realize that Islam erases any sins that came before it, and indeed 
    Allaah changes them into good deeds, as He says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 
“Except 
    those who repent and believe (in Islamic Monotheism), and do righteous 
    deeds; for those, Allaah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allaah 
    is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful”

    [al-Furqaan 25:70]
It was narrated that ‘Amr 
    ibn al-‘Aas said: When Allaah put Islam in my heart, I went to the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: “Give me your 
    right hand so that I may give you my oath of allegiance.” So he held out his 
    hand, but I held my hand back. He said, “What is the matter, O ‘Amr?” I 
    said, “I want to make a condition.” He said, “What is your condition?” I 
    said, “That I be forgiven.” He said, “Do you not know that Islam wipes out 
    whatever came before it, and that hijrah (migration for the sake of Allaah) 
    wipes out whatever came before it, and that Hajj wipes out whatever came 
    before it?” 
(Narrated by 
    Muslim, 121). 
This hadeeth 
    indicates that whoever becomes Muslim is forgiven for all the bad deeds that 
    he may have done before he became a Muslim. 
Secondly: 
It was 
    narrated from the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    that tattooing is haraam (forbidden). 
It was 
    narrated that Abu Juhayfah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “The 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed the one who 
    does tattoos, the one who has a tattoo done, the one who consumes riba 
    (usury or interest) and the one who pays it, and he forbade the price of a 
    dog and the earnings of a prostitute, and he cursed the image-makers.” 
(Narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari, 5032). 
Tattooing is 
    a major sin, but if a person repents from it, Allaah will accept his 
    repentance. 
Thirdly: 
Modern 
    medicine is able to remove tattoos; the remedy exists so you can easily get 
    rid of it, in sha Allah. 
Fourthly: 
The curse of 
    the woman who does tattoos is not permanent; rather when a person repents 
    from it, that curse is lifted. So it is a mistake for you to say that you 
    are a cursed woman. Rather we ask Allaah to make you good and righteous. 
Fifthly: 
Undoubtedly 
    the one who wants to marry you will understand this issue, especially that 
    it was before you became Muslim. Even if it was after you became Muslim, so 
    long as the Muslim has repented from it, he cannot be blamed or called to 
    account for it, rather his bad deeds are changed into good deeds. 
And Allaah 
    knows best.",Islam Q&A
9229,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9229,Ridding oneself of arrogance,How should a person come over arrogance?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
Arrogance is a blameworthy characteristic which is the feature of Iblees and his cohorts in this world, those on whose hearts Allah has placed a seal. 
The first one who showed arrogance towards Allah and His creation was the accursed Iblees, when Allah commanded him to prostrate to Adam and he refused and was arrogant, and said, “I am better than him (Adam), You created me from fire, and him You created from clay.” 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And surely, We created you (your father Adam) and then gave you shape (the noble shape of a human being); then We told the angels, ‘Prostrate yourselves to Adam’, and they prostrated themselves, except Iblees (Satan), he refused to be of those who prostrated themselves.
(Allah) said: ‘What prevented you (O Iblees) that you did not prostrate yourself, when I commanded you?’ Iblees said: ‘I am better than him (Adam), You created me from fire, and him You created from clay’”
[al-A’raaf 7:11-12]
Arrogance is one of the characteristics of Iblees, so whoever wants to be arrogant should realize that he is acquiring a characteristic of the devils, and that he is not acquiring a characteristic of the noble angels who obeyed their Lord and fell down prostrate. 
Moreover, arrogance may be the cause of a person being deprived of Paradise and may mean that the Lord of Glory will not even look at him, as it says in the following two ahaadeeth: 
1 – It was narrated from ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ood that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No one who has an atom’s-weight of arrogance in his heart will enter Paradise.” A man said, “O Messenger of Allah, what if a man likes his clothes and his shoes to look good?” He said, “Allah is Beautiful and loves beauty. Arrogance means rejecting the truth and looking down on people.” 
Narrated by Muslim, 91. 
2 – It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever lets his garment drag along the ground out of pride, Allah will not look at him on the Day of Resurrection.” Abu Bakr said: “Sometimes my garment slips down on one side, unless I pay attention to it.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “You are not doing that out of pride.” 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3465 
Secondly: 
Pride is an attribute that is not befitting for anyone except Allah. Whoever seeks to compete with Allah in that, Allah will destroy him, wreak vengeance on him and make things difficult for him. 
It was narrated that Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri and Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blesisngs be upon him) said: “Allah, the Exalted, said: 'Might is His garment and pride is His cloak; whoever seeks to compete with Me concerning them, I will punish him.'” 
Narrated by Muslim, 2620. 
Al-Nawawi said: This is how it is narrated in all texts. The pronoun in the words ‘His garment’ and ‘His cloak’ refers to Allah, and there is something omitted; what is meant is ‘Allah says, ‘whoever seeks to compete with Me concerning them, I will punish him’. 
What is meant by ‘seeks to compete with Me’ is seeking to acquire that characteristic in the sense of sharing in it. 
This is a stern warning against arrogance which clearly demonstrates that it is haram. 
Sharh Muslim, 16/173. 
Everyone who tries to be arrogant and put himself above others, Allah will bring him down among the lowest of the low, and will humiliate him, because he is going against reality, so Allah will punish him by thwarting his aims; the punishment is to fit the crime. 
The one who is arrogant towards the people will be trampled beneath the feet of the people on the Day of Resurrection, as a punishment for his arrogance. 
It was narrated from ‘Amr ibn Shu’ayb via his father and grandfather that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “On the Day of Resurrection, the arrogant will be gathered like ants in the form of men. Humiliation will overwhelm them from all sides. They will be driven to a prison in Hell called Bawlas, with the hottest fire rising over them, and they will be given to drink of the juice of the inhabitants of Hell, which is teenat al-khabaal.” 
Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2492; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 2025. 
Thirdly: 
Arrogance is of several types, including the following: 
1 – When a person does not accept the truth and produces false arguments against it, as we have mentioned in the hadeeth of ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ood, “Arrogance means rejecting the truth and looking down on people.” 
2 – When a person admires himself for his beauty or handsomeness, or the fineness of his food or clothing, so he feels proud and arrogant and feels superior to people. 
It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said (or Abu’l-Qaasim (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said): “Whilst a man was walking, dragging his garment with pride, with his hair nicely combed, Allah caused the earth to swallow him and he will go on sinking in it until the Day of Resurrection.” 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3297; Muslim, 2088 
A similar case is the story of the friend of the man whose companion spoke to him arrogantly. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
 
“And he had property (or fruit) and he said to his companion, in the course of mutual talk: ‘I am more than you in wealth and stronger in respect of men’”
[al-Kahf 18:34]
It may be that he was boasting about his tribe and linage.  
Fourthly: 
One of the remedies for arrogance is to think of yourself as being just like other people and realize that they are like you, they were born from a mother and a father just as you were, and that taqwa (piety, fear of Allah) is the true criterion of superiority. 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, the most honourable of you with Allah is that (believer) who has At-Taqwa [i.e. he is one of the Muttaqoon (the pious)”
[al-Hujuraat 49:13]
The arrogant Muslim should realize that no matter what he achieves, he is still too weak to attain a stature like the mountains in height or rend nor penetrate the earth (cf. al-Isra’ 17:37), as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And turn not your face away from men with pride, nor walk in insolence through the earth. Verily, Allah likes not any arrogant boaster.
And be moderate (or show no insolence) in your walking, and lower your voice. Verily, the harshest of all voices is the braying of the asses”
[Luqmaan 31:18-19]
Al-Qurtubi said: 
The phrase “nor walk in insolence through the earth” is a prohibition of arrogance and is enjoining humility. Marah (translated here as insolence) is excessive joy, or it was said that it means being arrogant in walking, or thinking too highly of oneself.  
Qutaadah said: it means showing off in walking; or it was said that it means vanity. 
All of these suggestions are close in meaning, but they may be divided into two categories: those which are blameworthy and those which are praiseworthy. 
Arrogance, vanity, showing off and thinking too highly of oneself are blameworthy; joy and energy are praiseworthy. 
Tafseer al-Qurtubi, 10/260. 
Another remedy for arrogance is for a person to realize that on the Day of Resurrection he will be gathered in a small form like an ant which will be trampled underfoot. Arrogant people are hated by other people just as they are hated by Allah; people love humble, tolerant and gentle people, and they hate those who are harsh and cruel to people.  
Another remedy is to remember that he and urine came out of the same place; that he began as a despised drop of sperm and he will end up as a rotten corpse, and that in between he is a vessel for faeces.  So what does he have to feel so proud and arrogant about?! 
We ask Allah to rid us all of arrogance and make us humble. 
And Allah knows best.",Islam Q&A
9231,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9231,Persisting in sin,What will happened to that person doing same sin again and again ?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
If a person commits sin time after time, his sin is forgiven every time if he follows his sin with repentance – if his repentance each time is sincere. The evidence that it is permissible to repent time after time is the fact that those who apostatized from Islam at the time of Abu Bakr were brought back to Islam by Abu Bakr and he accepted that from them, although he knew that they had been kaafirs, then they entered Islam, then they went back to kufr, then they came back to Islam. All the Sahaabah accepted their repentance despite the fact that what the apostates had done was worse than what a sinning Muslim does. So the repentance of a sinning Muslim, even if he sins repeatedly, is more likely to be accepted than repentance on the part of a kaafir time after time.  
But what we are saying is subject to the condition that the first and subsequent cases of repentance be sincere and from the heart, not simply an outward show of repentance. 
What we are saying should not be understood to mean that we are encouraging sin and that it may be committed time after time, and that the Muslim should take the mercy of Allaah and the fact that Allaah accepts repentance as an excuse to commit sin. No, our intention is to encourage the sinner to repent time after time. We want to put the mind of the Muslim who wants to come back to Allaah at rest, and tell him that the gate of mercy is open, and that Allaah’s forgiveness is greater than his sin, so he should not despair of the mercy of Allaah and he should keep turning to Him. 
Al-Bukhaari (7507) and Muslim (2758) narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said that his Lord said: “My slave commits sin, then he says, ‘O Allaah, forgive me my sin.’ Then Allaah says, ‘My slave has committed a sin, but he knows that he has a Lord Who forgives sin and takes away sin. So I forgive My slave.’ Then he commits sin again, and says, ‘O Allaah, forgive me my sin.’ Then Allaah says, ‘My slave has committed a sin, but he knows that he has a Lord Who forgives sin and takes away sin. So I forgive My slave.’ Then he commits sin again, and says, ‘O Allaah, forgive me my sin.’ Then Allaah says, ‘My slave has committed a sin, but he knows that he has a Lord Who forgives sin and takes away sin. So I forgive My slave.’ …” 
Al-Haafiz Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali said: 
Ibn Abi Dunya narrated with his isnaad that ‘Ali said: “The best of you is every tempted one who repents (i.e., every time he is tempted by this world, he repents).” It was said, “What if he sins again?” He said, “He should ask Allaah for forgiveness and repent.” It was said, “What if he sins again?” He said, “He should ask Allaah for forgiveness and repent.” It was said, “What if he sins again?” He said, “He should ask Allaah for forgiveness and repent.” It was said, “For how long?” He said, “Until the Shaytaan is defeated.” 
Ibn Maajah narrated a marfoo’ report from Ibn Mas’ood which says: “The one who repents from sin is like the one who did not commit sin.” (Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah, 3427). 
It was said to al-Hasan: Shouldn’t one of us feel too shy to ask his Lord to forgive his sin, then do it again, then ask for forgiveness, then do it again? He said: The Shaytaan wishes that you would have this attitude, so do not tire of asking for forgiveness. 
And it was narrated that he said: I do not think this is anything other than the attitude of the believers, i.e., every time a believer sins, he repents. 
‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez said in his khutbah: O people, whoever commits sin, let him seek the forgiveness of Allah and repent. If he does it again, let him seek the forgiveness of Allah and repent, and if he does it again, let him seek the forgiveness of Allah and repent. For it is sin which hangs around a person’s neck, and doom comes from persisting in sin. 
What this means is that a person will inevitably commit the sins that it is decreed he will commit, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Every son of Adam has his share of zina (adultery) written for him, and that will inevitably catch up with him.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2657). 
But Allaah has given people a way out from the sins they commit and sin is erased by repentance and seeking forgiveness. If they do that then they will get rid of the evil of sin, but if they persist in sin, then they will be doomed.

Benefits of reading the Quran","Praise be to Allah.Welcome to Islam message
We praise Allah Who has lighted the path of truth for you and enabled you to become convinced of Islam which is the true religion. All you have to do now is to utter the Two Testimonies of Faith (the Shahadatayn) in order to set your affairs straight, and you will be granted divine support in this world and in the Hereafter. So hasten to take this step and I ask Allah to make you steadfast in adhering to His religion. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds. 
How to be a righteous wife in Islam
In order to be a righteous wife with whom Allah is pleased, we advise you, after obeying Allah, to obey your husband so long as he does not tell you to do anything wrong or sinful, for a wife’s obedience towards her husband is one of the most important principles of marriage propagated in Islam. 
Mu`adh ibn Jabal (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If I were to command anyone to prostrate to anyone else, I would have commanded women to prostrate to their husbands, because of the husband’s great rights. No woman can find the sweetness of faith until she fulfils her husband’s rights , even if he calls her to him when she is atop her camel.”  
Al-Haythami (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “This was narrated in full by Al-Bazzar and in part by Ahmad, and the men of its Isnad [chain of narration] are the men of sahih.” (Majma` Az-Zawa’id, 4/309) 
Give up the bad customs that you used to engage in before Islam 
After that you have to give up the bad customs that you used to engage in before your Islam, that go against Islam and its commandments. 

That includes Tabarruj (wanton display) , being unveiled and not wearing proper Islamic Hijab – if you are one of those who do not wear Islamic dress. You also have to give up such customs of the disbelievers as mixing with men, and making friends with men who are not your Mahrams. 
You have to get used to Muslim customs and the commands of their religion which teaches that the Muslim woman is to be protected and not to wander about half naked in the marketplaces and places where there is free mixing with men, because that offends her husband’s honour.  

Lifestyle after conversion to Islam
With regard to the way of life that you have to follow, that is by adhering to the commands enjoined by Allah and by avoiding the things that Allah has forbidden; that includes praying and fasting regularly and remembering Allah in all situations. In all of that it will help if you read the Quran and useful books which describe Islam and its teachings. 
Etiquettes of entering the mosque
With regard to the guidelines on women entering the mosque , they are as follows: 

She should not go out wearing perfume , adornment or make-up. This does not apply only to going out to the mosque, rather whenever she goes out of her house, it is prohibited for her to go out wearing makeup. Her purpose in going out of the house should be to pray to Allah or to attend a lesson from which she can learn the rulings of her religion. 

Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not prevent the female slaves of Allah from going to the mosques of Allah , but let them go out not wearing perfume.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 565; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud, 529) 

It is Sunnah for the Muslim, when he leaves his house and heads towards the mosque, to recite the Du`a for walking to the mosque: 

`Abdullah ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “… Then the Mu’adhdhin gave the call to prayer, and he (the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)) came out, saying, ‘Allahumma aj`al fi qalbi nuran wa fi lisani nuran waj’al fi sam’i nuran waj’al fi basari nuran waj`al min khalfi nuran wa min amami nuran waj`al min fawqi nuran wa min tahti nuran, Allahummah a`tini nuran (O Allah, place with my heart light, and upon my tongue light, and within my ears light and within my eyes light, and place behind me light and in front of me light and above me light and beneath me light, O Allah, bestow upon me light).” (Narrated by Muslim, 763) 

When one enters the mosque, one should enter with his right foot first, and say the words that were narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): 

Abu Humayd or Abu Usayd (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When any one of you enters the mosque, let him say: Allahumma iftah li abwab rahmatika (O Allah, open to me the gates of Your mercy), and when he leaves let him say, Allahumma inni as’aluka min fadlika (O Allah, I ask You of Your bounty).” (Narrated by Muslim, 713) 
According to some reports, the words Bismillah, Allahumma salli ‘ala Muhammad (In the name of Allah, O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad) are added at the beginning of each. (See At-Tirmidhi, 314; Ibn Majah, 771. Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah, 625) 
Haywah ibn Shurayh (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “I met ‘Uqbah ibn Muslim and said to him, ‘I heard that you narrated from ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr ibn Al-‘As that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) entered the mosque, he would say, “A’udhu Billah il-‘Athim wa bi wajhihi’l-karim wa sultanihi’l-qadim min Ash-shaytan ir-rajim (O Allah, I seek refuge in Your noble countenance and Your eternal authority from the accursed satan).”’ He said, ‘Is that all?’ I said, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘And when he said that, the devil said, “He is protected from me for the whole day.”’” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 466; classed as authentic by Shaykh Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud, 441) 

When the Muslim enters the mosque, he should not sit down until he has prayed two Rak`ahs to “greet the mosque ”. 

Abu Qutadah As-Sulami (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When any one of you enters the mosque, let him pray two Rak’ahs before he sits down.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 443; Muslim, 714) 
Abu Dawud (455) narrated that `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded that mosques should be built in every neighbourhood, and that they should be cleaned and perfumed. (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud, 437.) 

The mosque should be cleaned and perfumed by those who are able to do it:

Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The deeds of my Ummah, both good and bad, were shown to me, and I found that among the best of its deeds was removing a harmful thing from the road, and I found among the worst of its deeds leaving phlegm in the mosque and not burying it.” (Narrated by Muslim, 555) 

Not raising one’s voice in the mosque , even in reciting the Quran, because that may disturb one of the worshippers. 

Abu Sa’id (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went into I’tikaf (seclusion or retreat for worship) in the mosque, and he heard them reciting Quran in loud voices. He pulled back the curtain and said: “Each one of you is conversing with his Lord, so do not disturb one another and do not raise your voices above one another in reciting the Quran” – or he said, “in prayer”. (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 1332; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud, 1183) 

He should exit the mosque with the left foot first, and saying the Du`a narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 

Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When any one of you enters the mosque, let him send blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and say, Allahumma iftah li abwab rahmatika (O Allah, open to me the gates of Your mercy). And when he leaves let him send blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and say, Allahumma i’simni min Ash-Shaytan ir-rajim (O Allah, protect me from the accursed satan). (Narrated by Ibn Majah, 773. This Hadith was classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Al-Jami’, 515) 
Benefits of reading the Quran
With regard to reading the Quran, you should read it a lot, because for every letter that you read you will have ten Hasanat (good deeds). It is permissible to recite the Quran with or without Wudu’, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to remember Allah in all situations. (Narrated by Muslim, 373) But it is better to do Wudu’ before reciting the Quran. 
Muhajir ibn Qunfudh (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that he came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) whilst he was urinating and greeted him with Salam, but he did not return the greeting until he had done wudu’. Then he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) apologised to him and said, “I did not want to mention Allah when I was not in a state of purity.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 17 – this version was narrated by him; Ibn Majah, 350. Classed as authentic by Shaykh Al-Albani in Sahih Al-Jami’, 2472) 
But it is prohibited for one who is Junub (in a state of impurity following sexual activity) to recite the Quran. With regard to a menstruating woman, the correct view is that it is permissible for her to recite the Quran. Please see question no. 2564 . 
All of that has to do with reciting the Quran without touching the Mus-haf. With regard to touching the Mus-haf , that is only permissible for one who has Wudu’, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “No one should touch the Quran except one who is pure.” (Narrated by Malik in Al-Muwatta’, 419; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Irwa’ Al-Ghalil, 122) 
If the Muslim wants to read from the Mus-haf and he does not have Wudu’, he should hold the book with something in between, such as wearing gloves on his hands. 
It is Sunnah for him to be humble and think of the meaning of the verses that he is reading. He should ask about the meaning if he finds the words difficult to understand, so that he will increase in knowledge whilst reading. After that he should strive to act in accordance with what he has learned and apply the rulings of the Quran.

Is it allowed to go to her to teach her Islam at her own home?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly:
We must note that Islam forbids entering upon non-mahram women. The evidence for that is as follows: 
It was narrated from ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Aamir (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Beware of entering upon women.” A man from among the Ansaar said, “O Messenger of Allaah, what do you think of the in-law?’ He said, “The in-law is death.” 
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4934; Muslim, 2172) 
The in-law refers to relatives of the husband who are not mahrams for the wife. 
It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “No man should be alone with a (non-mahram) woman and (a woman) should not travel except with a mahram.” 
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2844; Muslim, 1341). 
Secondly: 
The Shaytaan may make a woman, even if she is old, appear attractive in the eyes of a young man or old man, or vice versa, and may make him gradually fall into immoral actions. There are many stories that illustrate this. 
Thirdly: 
It is better for one of these young men to delegate his wife or sister or daughter, or some of the Muslim sisters, to do this good deed. This is better than a man serving her (the old lady). It is better and more effective for women to deal with women than for men to do so, especially when it comes to matters having to do with rulings that affect women. But if there are no women (who can do this), then it is permissible (for a man) to serve her, on condition that he not be alone with her. So one or more other brothers should go with you, and that should also be subject to other shar’i conditions such as hijaab etc., and you should only stay with her for as long as is necessary.

How could one fought against the amir of the muslims, even if the caliph prayed, gave his zakah and so on? They say also that he made an contract with the english army and fought with them against the muslims.

    among mankind and the jinn. Even the Prophets of Allaah were not safe from that.
 The enmity of people was directed against the scholars in the past, especially 
    the proponents of the true call (of Islam). They were met with intense hostility from the people. An example of that is Shaykh al-Islam Ibn 
    Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him); some of those who were jealous of him regarded it as permissible to shed his blood, others accused him of 
    being misguided and of going beyond the pale of Islam and becoming an apostate. 
 Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab was simply another of these wronged scholars 
    who were falsely accused by people, in an attempt to cause trouble (fitnah). People’s only motives for doing that were jealousy and hatred, along 
    with the fact that bid’ah was so firmly entrenched in their hearts, or they were ignorant and were blindly imitating the people of whims and 
    desires. 
We will mention some of the false accusations that were made against the Shaykh, 
    and will refute them. 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez al-‘Abd al-‘Lateef said: 
Some opponents of the salafi da’wah claim that Imam Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab 
    rebelled against the Ottoman Caliphate, thus splitting the jamaa’ah (main body of the Muslims) and refusing to hear and obey (the ruler). 
Da’aawa al-Munaawi’een li Da’wat al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahaab, 
    p. 233 
He said: 
‘Abd al-Qadeem Zalloom claims that the emergence of the Wahhaabis and their call was a cause 
    of the fall of the Caliphate. It was said that the Wahhaabis formed a state within the Islamic state, under the leadership of Muhammad ibn Sa’ood 
    and subsequently his son ‘Abd al-‘Azeez, which was supplied with weapons and money by the British, and they set out to gain control of other lands 
    that were under the rule of Caliphate, motivated by the urge to spread their beliefs, i.e., they raised their swords against the Caliph and fought 
    the Muslim army, the army of the Ameer al-Mu’mineen, with the encouragement and support of the British. 
Kayfa hudimat al-Khilaafah, p. 10. 
Before we respond to the false accusation that Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab 
    rebelled against the Caliphate, we should mention the fact that the Shaykh believed that hearing and obeying the imams (leaders) of the Muslims 
    was obligatory, whether they are righteous or immoral, so long as they did not enjoin disobedience towards Allaah, because obedience is only with 
    regard to what is right and proper. 
The Shaykh said in his letter to the people of al-Qaseem: “I believe that it is 
    obligatory to hear and obey the leaders of the Muslims, whether they are righteous or immoral, so long as they do not enjoin disobedience towards 
    Allaah. Whoever has become Caliph and the people have given him their support and accepted him, even if he has gained the position of caliph by 
    force, is to be obeyed and it is haraam to rebel against him.” 
Majmoo’at Mu’allafaat al-Shaykh, 5/11 
And he also said: 
One of the main principles of unity is to hear and obey whoever is appointed over us even if 
    he is an Abyssinian slave…” 
Majmoo’ah Mu’allafaat al-Shaykh, 1/394; quoted in 
    Da’aawa al-Munaawi’een, 233-234. 
And Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez al-‘Abd al-Lateef said: 
After stating these facts which explain that the Shaykh believed it was obligatory to hear and 
    obey the leaders of the Muslims, whether they are righteous or immoral, so long as they do not enjoin disobedience towards Allaah, we may refer to 
    an important issue in response to that false accusation. There is an important question which is: was Najd, where this call originated and first 
    developed, under the sovereignty of the Ottoman state? 
Dr Saalih al-‘Abood answered this by saying: 
Najd never came under Ottoman rule, because the rule of the Ottoman state never 
    reached that far, no Ottoman governor was appointed over that region and the Turkish soldiers never marched through its land during the period 
    that preceded the emergence of the call of Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab (may Allaah have mercy on him).  This fact is indicated by the fact 
    that the Ottoman state was divided into administrative provinces. This is known from a Turkish document entitled Qawaaneen Aal ‘Uthmaan 
    Mudaameen Daftar al-Deewaan (Laws of the Ottomans concerning what is contained in the Legislation), which was written by Yameen ‘Ali Effendi 
    who was in charge of the Constitution in 1018 AH/1609 CE. This document indicates that from the beginning of the eleventh century AH the Ottoman 
    state was divided into 23 provinces, of which 14 were Arabic provinces, and the land of Najd was not one of them, with the except of al-Ihsa’, if 
    we count al-Ihsa’ as part of Najd. 
‘Aqeedat al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab wa atharuha fi’l-‘Aalam 
    al-Islami (unpublished), 1/27 
And Dr ‘Abd-Allaah al-‘Uthaymeen said: 
Whatever the case, Najd never experienced direct Ottoman rule before the call of 
    Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab emerged, just as it never experienced any strong influence that could have an impact on events inside Najd. No 
    one had any such influence,  and the influence of Bani Jabr or Bani Khaalid in some parts, or the Ashraaf in other parts, was limited. None of 
    them were able to bring about political stability, so wars between the various regions of Najd continued and there were ongoing violent conflicts 
    between its various tribes. 
Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab Hayaatuhu wa Fikruhu, p. 
    11; quoted in Da’aawa al-Munaawi’een, 234-235. 
We will complete this discussion by quoting what Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn 
    Baaz said in response to this false accusation. He said (may Allaah have mercy on him): 
Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab did not rebel against the Ottoman Caliphate as 
    far as I know, because there was no area in Najd that was under Turkish rule. Rather Najd consisted of small emirates and scattered villages, and 
    each town or village, no matter how small, was ruled by an independent emir. These were emirates between which there were fighting, wars and 
    disputes. So Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab did not rebel against the Ottoman state, rather he rebelled against the corrupt situation in his 
    own land, and he strove in jihad for the sake of Allaah and persisted until the light of this call spread to other lands… 
Conversation recorded on tape; quoted in Da’aawa al-Munaawi’een, p. 237 
Dr. ‘Ajeel al-Nashmi said: … The Caliphate did not react in any way and did not show any 
    discontent or resentment during the life of the Shaykh, even though there were four Ottoman sultans during his lifetime… 
Majallat al-Mujtama’, issue # 510. 
If the above is a reflection of the Shaykh’s attitude towards the Caliphate, how 
    did the Caliphate view the call of Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab? 
Dr. al-Nashmi said, answering this question: 
The view that the Caliphate had of the movement of Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Abd 
    al-Wahhaab was very distorted and confused, because the Caliphate only listened to those who were hostile towards the movement of Shaykh Muhammad 
    ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab, whether that was via reports sent by their governors in the Hijaaz, Baghdad and elsewhere, or via some individuals who 
    reached Istanbul bearing news. 
Al-Mujtama’, issue #504; quoted in Da’aawa 
    al-Munaawi’een, p. 238-239. 
With regard to Zalloum’s claims that the Shaykh’s call was one of the reasons for the fall of 
    the Caliphate and that the English helped the Wahhaabis to topple it, Mahmoud Mahdi al-Istanbuli says concerning this ridiculous claim: 
This writer should be expected to produce proof and evidence for his opinion. Long 
    ago the poet said: 
If claims are not supported by proof, they are used only by the fools as 
    evidence. 
We should also note that history tells us that the English were opposed to this call from the 
    outset, fearing that it might wake the Muslim world up.

And he says: 
The ironic fact is that this professor accuses the movement of Shaykh Muhammad ibn 
    ‘Abd al-Wahhaab of being one of the factors that led to the destruction of the Ottoman Caliphate, even though this movement began in 1811 CE and 
    the Caliphate was abolished in 1922 CE. 
Op. cit., p. 64 
What indicates that the English were opposed to the Wahhabi movement is the fact 
    that they sent Captain Foster Sadler to congratulate Ibrahim Pasha on his success against the Wahhabis – during the war of Ibrahim Pasha in 
    Dar’iyyah – and also to find out to what extent he was prepared to cooperate with the British authorities to reduce what they called Wahhabi 
    piracy in the Arabian Gulf. 
Indeed, this letter clearly expressed a desire to establish an agreement between 
    the British government and Ibrahim Pasha with the aim of destroying the Wahhabis completely. 
Shaykh Muhammad ibn Manzoor al-Nu’maani said: 
The English made the most of the hostility that existed in India towards Shaykh 
    Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab and they accused everyone who opposed them and stood in their way, or whom they regarded as dangerous, of being 
    Wahhabis… Similarly the English called the scholars of Deoband – in India – Wahhaabis, because of their blunt opposition to the English and their 
    putting pressure on them.

    p. 105-106 
From these various quotations we can see the falseness of these flawed arguments when compared 
    to the clear academic proofs in the essays and books of the Shaykh; that falseness is also obvious when compared to the historical facts are 
    recorded by fair-minded writers. 
Da’aawa al-Munaawi’een, 239, 240. 
Finally, we advise everyone who has slandered the Shaykh to restrain his tongue 
    and to fear Allaah with regard to him. Perhaps Allaah will accept their repentance and guide them to the straight path.

9245,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9245,Does a Coma Break Your Fast?,A man fell into a coma whilst he was fasting. Is his fast invalidated?,"If a man falls into a coma in Ramadan for the entire day – i.e., from dawn until sunset – his fast is not valid, and he has to make up the fasts he missed. If he was awake for part of the day, then his fast is valid.",,"Praise be to Allah.The view of Imam al-Shafi`i and Imam Ahmad is that if a person falls into a coma in Ramadan , one of the following two scenarios must apply: 

The coma lasts all day, i.e., he is unconscious from before dawn until after the sun sets . In this case his fast is not valid, and he must make up this day after Ramadan. 

The evidence that his fast is not valid is that fasting means abstaining from things that invalidate the fast, with the intention of doing so, because Allah says in the hadith qudsi that the fasting person “gives up his food, his drink and his desire for My sake.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1894; Muslim, 1151) So the abstention is connected to the prior intention on the part of the fasting person , and this cannot apply to one who is in a coma. 
The evidence that the fast must be made up later on is the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number [of days which one did not observe Sawm (fasts) must be made up] from other days.” [al-Baqarah 2:185]

He is awake for part of the day, if only for a moment. In this case his fast is valid, whether he woke up at the beginning of the day, at the end or in the middle. 

Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said, mentioning the different scholarly opinions on this matter: 
“The most correct view says that this is subject to the condition that he be awake for a part of the day. 
This means the soundness of the unconscious person’s fasts depends on his being awake for part of the day. 
The evidence for his fast being sound if he is awake for part of the day is that he has consciously abstained from things that break the fast in general. (See Hashiyat Ibn Qasim ‘ala al-Rawd al-Muraba’, 3/381) 
So to sum up, the answer is that if a man is unconscious for the entire day – i.e., from dawn until sunset – his fast is not valid, and he has to make up the fasts he missed.  If he was awake for part of the day, then his fast is valid. This is the view of al-Shafi`i and Ahmad, and was the view favoured by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him). (See al-Majmu’, 6/346; al-Mughni, 4/344; al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 6/365)

    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “O young men, whoever among you is able to, let him get married. Whoever is not

Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5065; Muslim, 1400 
A shield means protection against committing 
    immoral actions. 
The scholars differed concerning the meaning 
    of ability here, and there are two opinions. Some of them said that it means the ability to afford the expenses of marriage and spending on one’s 
    wife; others said that it means the ability to have intercourse. There is no conflict between the two meanings, so what it meant is that whoever 
    is able to have intercourse and can afford it, let him get married. 
Al-Nawawi said: 
The scholars differed concerning the meaning 
    of ability here, and there are two views which boil down to the same meaning. The sounder of these two views is that what is meant is what the 
    word (al-baa’ah) means in Arabic, which is the ability to have intercourse. So the meaning is, whoever is able to have intercourse because 
    he can afford the expenses of marriage, then let him get married. Whoever is unable to have intercourse because he cannot afford the expenses of 
    marriage, then he has to fast in order to control his desire.

    The way in which women pray is the same as the way in which 
    men pray in every part of the prayer, prostration, sitting, and so on. This 
    is based on the following evidence: 

    1 – The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said: “Pray as you have seen me praying.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari. This 
    is addressed to both men and woman. 

    Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    Everything that we have said above about the way in which the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) prayed applies 
    equally to men and women. There is nothing narrated in the Sunnah which 
    implies that women are exempted from any of that. Rather the general meaning 
    of the words of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him), “Pray as you have seen me praying,” include women too. 

    Sifat Salaat al-Nabi, p. 189 

    2 – The general meaning of the words of the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Women are the twin halves of 
    men.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 204; al-Tirmidhi, 105, from the hadeeth of 
    ‘Aa’ishah. Also narrated by al-Daarimi, 764, from the hadeeth of Anas. 

    Al-‘Ajlooni said: Ibn Qattaan said: The isnaad from ‘Aa’ishah 
    is da’eef (weak), but the isnaad from Anas is saheeh (sound). 

    Kashf al-Khafa’, 1/248 
Al-Khattaabi said: What 
    we understand from this is: If something is said in the masculine, it is 
    addressed to women too, except in cases where there is evidence to indicate 
    that it applies only to women. 

    Some of the scholars said that a woman should not sit as a 
    man sits (in prayer), and they quoted two da’eef (weak) hadeeths as evidence 
    for that. 

    Al-Bayhaqi said: 

    Two da’eef hadeeth were narrated concerning that, the like of 
    which cannot be taken as evidence. 

    The first is the hadeeth of ‘Ata’ ibn al-‘Ajlaan from Abu 
    Nadrah al-‘Abdi from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri, the companion of the Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) from the Messenger 
    of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), that he used to 
    command the men to spread out their arms in their prostration and he used to 
    tell the women to keep their arms close to their sides in their prostration. 
    He used to tell the men to spread their left foot along the ground (and sit 
    on it) and place the right foot upright during the tashahhud and he used to 
    tell the women to sit, kneeling, on their heels.” Then al-Bayyhaqi said: 
    This is a munkar hadeeth. 

    The other is the hadeeth of Abu Mutee’ al-Hakam ibn 
    ‘Abd-Allaah al-Balkhi from ‘Umar ibn Dharr from Mujaahid from ‘Abd-Allaah 
    ibn ‘Umar who said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “When a woman sits during the prayer she should 
    place one thigh against the other and when she prostrates she should press 
    her stomach against her thighs, compressing herself in the most concealing 
    manner, for Allaah looks at her and says: ‘O My angels, I call you to bear 
    witness that I have forgiven her.’” Sunan al-Bayhaqi al-Kubra, 
    2/222. 
This hadeeth is da’eef, 
    because it was narrated by Abu Mutee’ al-Balkhi. 

    Ibn Hajar said: 

    Ibn Mu’een said: He is nothing. On one occasion he said: He 
    is da’eef. Al-Bukhaari said: He is da’eef. Al-Nasaa’i said: He is da’eef. 
    Lisaan al-Mizaan, 2/334. 
Ibn ‘Adiyy said: It is 
    clear that Abu Mutee’ is da’eef in his ahaadeeth and everything that he 
    narrated, and for most of his narrations there are no corroborating 
    reports. 

    Al-Kaamil fi Du’afa’ al-Rijaal, 
    2/214 
A third hadeeth was 
    narrated from Yazeed ibn Abi Habeeb, saying that the Messenger of Allaah 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) passed by two women who 
    were praying. He said: “When you prostrate, press some of your flesh to the 
    ground, for women are not like men in that.” 

    This was narrated by Abu Dawood in al-Maraaseel (p. 
    118) and by al-Bayhaqi (2/223). 
This hadeeth is mursal, 
    which is a category of da’eef (weak). 

    In al-Musannaf (1/242), Ibn Abi Shaybah narrated some 
    reports from some of the salaf which suggest that there is a difference in 
    the way women and men sit (in prayer), but the only evidence that counts is 
    the words of Allaah and His Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him). Then he narrated from some of the salaf that the way in which men 
    and women pray is the same. 

    Al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Umm 
    al-Darda’ used to sit in prayer as a man sits and she was a scholarly 
    woman. 

    Al-Haafiz stated in Fath al-Baari that Abu’l-Darda’ 
    had two wives, both of whom were called Umm al-Darda’. The older one was a 
    Sahaabiyyah and the younger one was a Taabi’iyyah. He suggested that the one 
    who was referred to here by al-Bukhaari was the younger one.

If they are praying with non-mahram men, women should not raise their voices to say Ameen during the prayer or to say Subhaan Allah to alert the imam to a mistake. 
It was narrated from Sahl ibn Sa’d al-Saa’idi that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went to Bani ‘Amr ibn ‘Awf to reconcile between them. (In the meantime) the time for prayer came, and the muezzin came to Abu Bakr and said, “Will you lead the people in prayer, and should I say the iqaamah?” He said, “Yes.” So Abu Bakr started to lead the prayer. Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came when the people were still praying, and he passed through the rows until he stood in the first row. The people clapped but Abu Bakr used not to glance sideways whilst he was praying. When the people’s clapping continued, he turned and saw the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) gestured to him to stay where he was, so Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) raised his hands and praised Allah for what the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had told him to do. Then Abu Bakr stepped back until he was level with the row and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came forward and led the rest of the prayer. When he finished he said, “O Abu Bakr, what kept you from staying put when I told you to?” Abu Bakr said, “It was not right for the son of Abu Quhaafah [referring to himself] to lead the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in prayer.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “ Why did you clap so much? If something happens to anyone during his prayer, let him say Subhaan Allah, for if he says Subhaan Allah, people will take notice. Clapping is only for women.” 
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 652; Muslim, 421) 
Ibn Hajar said: 
He did not let women say Subhaan Allah because they are commanded to lower their voices in prayer in all circumstances, because of the fear that their voices may cause fitnah (temptation). He forbade men to clap because this is something for women. 
Fath al-Baari, 3/77
Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said: 
Some of the scholars said: It is makrooh for woman to say Subhaan-Allah (in such circumstances) and it is permissible for them to clap because most women’s voices are soft and a woman’s voice may distract the men who are praying with her. 
Al-Tamheed, 21/108 
Wali al-Deen al-‘Iraaqi said: 
If a woman goes against what is prescribed for her and says Subhaan Allah for something that alarms her, her prayer is not invalidated, but if she says it quietly in such a manner that no one can hear her, this do not serve the intended purpose. If she says it out loud so that the one whom she wants to make understand can hear it, then what we should say in this case is that if (the imam) is another woman or a mahram, then it is not makrooh, but if (the imam) is a non-mahram man, then it is makrooh and indeed it may be haraam, if we assume that the woman’s voice is ‘awrah. 
We do not mean that in such circumstances it is prescribed for her to say Subhaan Allah, rather we say that if she does say Subhaan Allah, it is not makrooh; what is prescribed for her and what is better is for her to clap, because the apparent meaning of the Prophet’s words “Clapping is for women” is that it is prescribed in all cases. And Allah knows best. 
Tarh al-Tathreeb, 2/248, 249 
Al-Zarkashi said: The scholars prescribed clapping for woman in all circumstances, and undoubtedly this applies when a woman is in the presence of non-mahram men. If she is with women or men who are her mahrams, then she may say Subhaan Allah, like reciting out loud in their presence.

Can you say Allah in the bathroom?","Praise be to Allah.Types of dhikr 
There are two types of dhikr; 1- dhikr with the tongue such as reciting Quran and du`as, which is encouraged in the Shari`ah, and 2- dhikr in the heart, which means thinking of Allah and His greatness and power, or reciting the Quran in one’s heart. This does not bring the same reward as reading Quran, because the reward has to do with reading, which can only be done on the tongue (by moving the tongue and speaking the words). The same applies to du`a; they should be spoken on the tongue and it is not sufficient to recite it in the heart.
Can you say Allah in the bathroom?
The scholars differentiated between the two types of dhikr. They said that it is makruh to remember Allah on the tongue (by speaking) in the bathroom and glorify Allah in that place. With regard to remembering Allah in one's heart, they said that this is not makuh and there is nothing wrong with it.  
The proof that this distinction is made between the two kinds of dhikr is the fact that the scholars agreed that it is permissible for a person who is in a state of impurity following sexual activity to recite Quran in his heart, but it is haram for him to recite it out loud or utter it. 
Al-Nawawi said: 
“The scholars agreed that if a person who is junub thinks of Quran in his heart, without moving his tongue, he is not reciting it in the way that is forbidden for one who is junub.” (Sharh al-Nawawi ‘ala Sahih Muslim, 4/103) 
Ibn al-Mundhir said in al-Awsat: 
“`Ikrimah said: A person should not remember Allah on his tongue (by speaking) when he is in the toilet, rather (he should do so) in his heart.” (Al-Awsat, 1/341)
The Standing Committee said: 
“It is part of Islamic etiquette that a person should remember his Lord when he wants to enter the toilet or the bathroom , by saying before he enters: “Allahumma inni a’udhu bika min al-khubthi wa’l-khabaith (O Allah, I seek refuge with You from the male and female devils).” But he should not mention Allah after he enters, rather he should stop mentioning Him after he enters.” (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 5/93)
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz said: 
“Remembering Allah in one's heart is permissible at all times and in all places, in the washroom and elsewhere. Rather what is makruh in the washroom and similar places is to remember Allah on one’s tongue (by speaking), except for saying Bismillah when beginning to do wudu .

      wrong and hating it) – and that is the weakest of faith.” (Narrated by Muslim
      in his Saheeh from the
      hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allaah be pleased with him).
      If the interests of sharee’ah are better served by a person’s staying
      in the environment where the evil action is taking place, and they
      outweigh the negative outcomes, and he does not fear that he will be
      overcome by temptation if he stays among people who are committing this
      sin, and he also denounces it according to his means, (this is OK);
      otherwise, he should forsake them in order to protect his own commitment
      to religion.","From Fataawaa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 12/335"

Is singing haram?","Praise be to Allah.Is music haram?
With regard to music , the ruling is that it is haram to play musical instruments . Here we will explain some of the things that are permitted to women only. 
Is it permissible for women to beat the daff?
It is permissible for women to beat the daff and to sing permissible songs on permissible occasions such as ‘Eid, celebrations and the like. 
Shaykh al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
It is permissible for him – the bridegroom – to allow women to announce the marriage by beating the daff only, and by singing permissible songs in which there is no description of beauty or mention of immoral phrases… then he mentioned the evidence for that.” (Adab al-Zafaf, p. 93). 
The evidence that the Shaykh mentioned is: 
Al-Rubayyi’ bint Mu’awwidh said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) entered upon me on the day of my wedding and sat on my mattress as you are sitting now, and young girls were beating the daff and singing about their fathers who had been killed at the battle of Badr, until a girl said, “And among us is a Prophet who knows what will happen tomorrow.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Do not say this, but say the other things that you were saying.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3700) 
`Aishah narrated that she took a woman on her wedding night to a man from among the Ansar, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to her, “O `Aishah, was there any entertainment  (in the gathering)? The Ansar love entertainment.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 4765)
Abu Ishaq said: I heard `Amir ibn Sa’d al-Bajali say: I saw Thabit ibn Wadi’ah and Qarazah ibn Ka’b al-Ansari at a wedding, and there was singing. I spoke to them about that and they said that a concession had been granted allowing singing at weddings and weeping for the dead, so long as there was no wailing. (Narrated by al-Bayhaqi, 14469) 
Muhammad ibn Hatib al-Jamahi said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The thing that differentiates between haram and halal is the beating of the daff and voices.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1008; al-Nasai, 3316; Ibn Majah, 1886. (Classed as hasan by al-Albani in Adab al-Zafaf, p. 96) 
This is what it is permitted for women to do of singing at weddings. The only musical instrument that is permissible for them is the daff, and not others such as the tabl. The difference between them is that the tabl is covered on both sides whereas the daff is open on one side and covered on the other. 
The Standing Committee said:  
“With regard to the tabl and other kinds of musical instruments, it is not permissible to use them with these anashid, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) did not do that.” (Fatawa, no. 3259, dated 13/10/1400 AH) 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“With regard to the tabl, it is not permissible to beat it in weddings, rather the daff only should be used.” (Fatawa Islamiyyah, 3/185) 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said: 
“The drum that is covered on both sides is called the tabl, and it is not permissible, because it is a kind of musical instrument and all kinds of musical instruments are haram, except that for which there is evidence that it is halal, which is the daff at weddings.” (Fatawa Islamiyyah, 3/186) 
Is dancing haram?
With regard to dancing , it is not permissible for women to dance in front of men, non-mahrams, mahrams or women, because of the fitnah that may be caused by the movements of the body. It is well known that women may feel desire for one another, and even if that is not the case, there is no guarantee that one of them will not go back to her menfolk and describe to them what she has seen of the beauty of the dancer and her movement, so this may affect the men and may cause a great deal of mischief. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade such things. 
‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No woman should look at another woman then describe her to her husband so that it is as if he can see her.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 4839) 
In the early days the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) allowed effeminate men to enter upon women, but when he saw one of them describing women and disclosing their secrets, he forbade them from doing that. 
Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) entered upon me and there was an effeminate man with me. I heard him say to ‘Abd-Allah ibn Abi Umayyah, “O ‘Abd-Allah, if Allah should enable you to conquer al-Taif tomorrow you should look for the daughter of Ghaylan…” then he described her. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “These people should not enter upon you.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3980; Muslim, 4048) 
The alluring movements of a woman are part of her `awrah, and it is not permissible for her to show them to anyone but her husband. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Dancing is makruh in principle, but if it is done in the western manner or in imitation of the non-Muslim women, then it becomes haram, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.” Moreover it sometimes leads to fitnah, because the dancer may be a young, beautiful woman, so the other women are tempted. Even if she is among other women, the other women may do things that indicate that they are tempted by her. And whatever is a cause of fitnah is not allowed.” (Liqa al-Bab al-Maftuh, q. 1085) 
And he said: 
“With regard to dancing on the part of women, it is an evil action and we cannot say that it is permissible, because we have heard of incidents that have occurred among women because of it. If it is done by men that is even worse, because that is men imitating women, and the evil involved is well known. If dancing is done among a mixed group of men and women, as some of the foolish do, that is even worse because of the mixing and great fitnah involved, especially when that is done at a wedding party.”  (Fatawa Islamiyyah, 3/187) 
Is singing haram?
With regard to permissible words in songs, they are those that do not contain any haram descriptions, or provoke desire, or words that are forbidden in the Shari`ah, or some innovated adhkar, and other haram things.  
There are sufficient permissible things that may be sung about, such as encouraging good morals, the pursuit of knowledge, giving up haram things, and so on. 
The Standing Committee said: 
“You are correct in your ruling that songs of the modern type are haram, because they include immoral words and things that are no good, and they include idle leisure and provocation of sexual desire, and promiscuity, and the voice has a quality that inspires evil thoughts in the mind of the listener. May Allah help us and you to do that which pleases Him. 
It is permissible for you to replace these songs with Islamic nashids which contain rulings, exhortation and teaching, which will increase people’s keenness and pride in their religion, and promote Islamic feelings and put people off evil and what leads to it.” (Fatwa no. 3295, dated 13/10/1400 AH)

9292,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/9292,Was Maa’iz married?,"Was Ma'iz ibn Malik married or unmarried and if he was a bachelor, why was he stoned? I ask this because I have read that he was not married and was stoned for persistent fornication. However, there are other ahadith about ""a man from Bani Aslam"" which match the case of Ma'iz (who was from the Aslam) in every detail but do not give the name of the man. Was this man Ma'iz?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The ahaadeeth which tell the story of Maa’iz (may Allaah be pleased with him) and 
    are narrated in al-Saheehayn were narrated through numerous isnaads. In some of them his name is given as Maa’iz, and in these it does not 
    say that he was married. And in some he is mentioned by the name of his tribe – “a man from Aslam” – and in these it says that he was married. 
The context of the ahaadeeth is the same which makes us certain that they are 
    speaking of the same story, which is the story of Maa’iz (may Allaah be pleased with him) and that he was married. This is stated in the text of 
    one hadeeth which is narrated by al-Bayhaqi as we shall see below. There follow some of the reports: 
According to the version narrated by Muslim, they took Maa’iz to the Harrah, and 
    this report states his name. According to a version narrated by al-Bukhaari, they stoned a man from (the tribe of) Aslam – and Maa’iz was a man 
    from the tribe of Aslam as we shall see in the hadeeth from Abu Sa’eed below – so they took him to the Harrah. We also draw your attention to the 
    similarity between the two hadeeth which both say that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) turned away from him four 
    times, etc. This makes us certain that the two hadeeths are telling the story of the same man. Based on that, it says in the report narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari that he was married. The two reports are as follows: 

    (a)
    Muslim (1694) narrated:
From Abu Sa’eed: that a man called Maa’iz ibn Maalik came to the Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: “I have committed adultery. Carry out (the hadd punishment) on me.” The 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) ignored him several times, then he asked his people (about him). They said: 
    “We do not know of anything wrong with him, except that he has committed some crime and he thinks that he will not be able to relieve himself of 
    its burden unless the hadd punishment is carried out on him.”  So he went back to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and 
    he commanded us to stone him. So we took him out to Baqee’ al-Gharqad and we did not tie him up or dig a hole for him. We stoned him with bones, 
    clods and pebbles. He ran away and we ran after him until he came to ‘Arad al-Harrah (a place in Madeenah), where he stopped, and we stoned him 
    with the rocks of the Harrah until he stopped moving (i.e., died). 

    (b)
    The report narrated by al-Bukhaari (4969):
It was narrated from Jaabir that a man from (the tribe of) Aslam came to the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when he was in the mosque and he said, “I have committed adultery.”  The Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) turned his face away from him. The man came to that side to which the Prophet had turned his face, and 
    testified against himself four times. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, ""Are you mad? Are you married?"" He said, 
    ""Yes.” So he commanded that he be stoned in the Musalla (Eid prayer place). When the stones troubled him, he ran away, until he was caught in 
    al-Harrah and killed.  
And it was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: A man from (the tribe of Aslam) came to the Messenger of Allaah  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when he was in the mosque and called him. He said, “O Messenger of Allaah, This man has committed 
    zina,” meaning himself. [The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)] turned his face away from him. The man came to that side to 
    which the Prophet had turned his face, and said, ""O Messenger of Allaah, this man has committed zina."" The Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) turned his face to the other side, and the man came to that side, and said the same thing. When he had testified against 
    himself four times, the Prophet called him and said, ""Are you mad?"" He said, ""No."" The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said, ""Take him away and stone him to death."" And he was married. When the stones troubled him, he ran away, but we caught up with him at 
    al-Harrah and stoned him to death (there)."" 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4970 
This is also stated clearly in Sunan al-Bayhaqi: 
It was narrated from Jaabir from the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): a man 
    from (the tribe of) Aslam testified against himself four times in his presence, admitting zina, so he ordered that he be stoned, as he was 
    married. He said: they said that that was Maa’iz. 
Sunan al-Bayhaqi al-Kubra, 8/218 
Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar stated in Fath al-Baari that these ahaadeeth tell the 
    story of one man, namely Maa’iz (may Allaah be pleased with him).  
The phrase “a man from Aslam” means a man from the famous tribe of Banu Aslam. The 
    name of this man was Maa’iz ibn Maalik as we shall see below; he was named as such by Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him). 
Al-Haafiz also said: 
The hadeeth which says that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) stoned Maa’iz, who was married, appears in al-Saheehayn from Abu Hurayrah. He said to him: “Are you married?” and he said, “Yes.” 
    This was also narrated by al-Bukhaari from Jaabir. 
Al-Diraayah fi Takhreej Ahaadeeth al-Hidaayah, 2/96. 
These ahaadeeth when taken together make us certain that when Maa’iz was stoned, 
    he was married. 
Maa’iz was not stoned because he frequently committed the sin of zina; there is no 
    evidence to indicate that Maa’iz was one of those who frequently commit zina. 
The previously-married person who commits zina deserves to be stoned, whether he 
    got married and divorced, or his wife passed away, or he is still married. 
There is no difference between one who commits zina once and one who commits this 
    sin repeatedly. Whoever has been previously married must be stoned. In the case of one who has not been previously married, the hadd punishment is 
    one hundred lashes and exile for one year.
