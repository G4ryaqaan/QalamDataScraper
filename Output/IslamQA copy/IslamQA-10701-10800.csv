10713,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10713,Cutting some of one’s hair in Hajj or ‘Umrah,"A man cut his hair on one side after doing ‘Umrah, then he went back to his family, and found out that what he had done was not correct. What should he do?",,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          This question was put to Shaykh Muhammad 
          ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) and he said: 
 
          If he did that out of ignorance, then 
          he should take off his regular clothing (and put on ihraam) and shave 
          his head completely or cut his hair, and what he did will be forgiven 
          because he was ignorant. Shaving or cutting the hair does not have to 
          be done in Makkah; it may be done in Makkah or elsewhere. 
 
          But if what he did was based on a fatwa 
          from one of the scholars, then he does not have to do anything, because 
          Allaah says: 
 
          “So ask of those who know the Scripture, 
          if you know not”
 
          [al-Nahl 16:43]
 
          and some of the scholars think that cutting 
          hair  from part of the head is like cutting hair from all of the 
          head.","See al-Liqaa’ al-Shahri, 10"
10714,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10714,It is not correct to differentiate between the Salafis and Ahl al-Sunnah,"What is your view of those who differentiate between the Salafis and Ahl al-Sunnah, and who regard the Salafis as a more specific group than Ahl al-Sunnah, and they that the principles of this group are based on the opinions of the group’s shaykhs?",,,"Praise be to Allah.This 
          is not correct, because the Ahl al-Sunnah are those who follow the Sahaabah 
          and the path of the Salaf (the early generations of Islam). These are 
          not two distinct groups, and the Salafis are not a more specific group! 
        According 
          to the terminology that is well known, the Salaf are the Sahaabah and 
          those who follow their path, and the Ahl al-Sunnah are those who follow 
          the Sunnah of the Messenger  (peace 
          and blessings of Allaah be upon him). They are the ones concerning whom 
          the hadeeth was reported: “Whoever follows the same path as me and my 
          Companions” (The hadeeth about the saved group). 
 Stirring 
          up disputes and conflict on the grounds of names alone is not permissible. 
          Allaah has commanded the believers to be united and has forbidden them 
          to be divided and warned them against that. 
 The 
          individual’s aim must be to seek the truth, and when he speaks he should 
          say what is fair and just, and not hate individuals in such a way that 
          his hatred makes him reject the truth that the person is saying, or 
          look for faults in him. He should not come up with things that are ambiguous 
          or far-fetched for that purpose. This is not the way of Ahl al-Sunnah, 
          and the Muslim has to like for his brother what he likes for himself. 
          He must be sincere towards him, and hold love and sincerity in his heart.",Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah al-Ghunaymaan
10721,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10721,Feeling that something is not right with seeking knowledge,Some seekers of Islamic knowledge feel that it is not right to aim for a certificate. How can the seeker of knowledge rid himself of these feelings?,,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          He may respond to that in several ways: 
 
          Firstly, he should not aim for the certificate itself, 
          rather these certificates should be used as a means to work in order 
          to benefit people in any given field, because nowadays work is based 
          on certificates, and people usually cannot find a way to benefit others 
          except by these means. If he develops this intention, then his intention 
          is sound.                                                                     
          
 
          Secondly, anyone who wants to gain knowledge can only 
          find it in these colleges, so he should enter with the intention of 
          seeking knowledge and not let himself be affected by whatever certificates 
          he may gain after that. 
 
          Thirdly, if a person wants to earn the good things of 
          both this world and the Hereafter by means of his work, there is nothing 
          wrong with that, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
 
          “And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to 
          Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty).
And He will provide him from (sources) he never could 
          imagine”
 
          [al-Talaaq 65:2-3]
 
           This is encouragement to fear Allaah with regard 
          to a worldly matter.
 
           If it is asked, with regard to a person who does 
          what he does for worldly purposes, how can we say that he is sincere? 
          
 
           Our answer is:
 
           If he is being sincere in his worship, and he does 
          not pay attention to people at all, and he is not doing it to show off 
          to people and earn their praise for his worship, rather his aim to earn 
          some materialistic gains as one of the results of his worship – then 
          this is not the same as showing off and trying to draw closer to people 
          by doing things which are only for drawing closer to Allaah, hoping 
          that people will praise him for that. But by hoping for material gain 
          from this action, his intention is undermined and it becomes a kind 
          of shirk, and his status is lower than that of someone whose intention 
          is focused solely on the Hereafter.
 
           I would like to take this opportunity to point 
          out when some people speak of worldly gains, such as saying that prayer 
          involves physical exercise and calms the nerves, and that fasting cleanses 
          the body and disciplines eating habits, we should not make worldly gains 
          the main aim of worship, because that will lead to a weakening of sincerity 
          and negligence in seeking the Hereafter. Hence Allaah has explained 
          to us in His Book that the wisdom behind fasting, for example, is to 
          promote taqwa (piety). The religious benefits are the primary aim, and 
          worldly benefits are secondary. When we speak to the common people we 
          should tell them of the spiritual aspects, and when we speak to those 
          who cannot be convinced by anything other than materialistic considerations, 
          then we can tell them of both the spiritual and worldly benefits; it 
          is a matter of addressing each in the manner he understands best.","From Fataawa al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen , Kitaab al-‘Ilm, p. 100"
10771,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10771,Making up naafil acts of worship,"When do we say that naafil acts of worship should not be made up? Is it because it is a Sunnah for which the time or place is no longer applicable? We know that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to make up some naafil acts of worship when the time for them had passed, such as Witr.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Naafil 
          acts which are done for a specific reason should not be made up once 
          the reason is no longer present. For example, if the sun is eclipsed 
          and a person was asleep, then when he wakes up he finds out that there 
          has been an eclipse, he should not do the eclipse prayer because the 
          occasion has passed. Similarly, if a man enters the mosque and stays 
          there for a long time thinking that he does not have wudoo’, then he 
          remembers that he does have wudoo’, he should not pray Tahiyyat 
          al-Masjid (two rak’ahs to “greet the mosque” upon entering) 
          because it is a Sunnah and the occasion for it has passed. The guideline 
          in these cases is that every naafil act which is done for a reason should 
          not be made up later, such as Witr. The Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not make up Witr as 
          such; he would pray twelve rak’ahs of Duhaa (optional mid-morning prayer). 
          The most he ever prayed in Witr was eleven rak’ahs, so he made up the 
          most but he made it even, because the occasion for praying Witr had 
          passed.","From the fatwas of Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen for al-Da’wah magazine, issue # 1756, p. 37"
10776,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10776,The Best Means to Increase Your Faith,What are the means of increasing faith?,The best 3 means to increase your faith are: 1- Learning about Allah through His names and attributes; 2- Observing the signs of Allah in the universe and the signs of Shari`ah; 3- Performing many acts of worship.,,"Praise be to Allah.There are several means of increasing faith :  

Learning about Allah through His names and attributes . The more a person learns about Allah through His names and attributes, the more he will increase in faith, without a doubt. Hence you find that the scholars who know more about the names and attributes of Allah than others do, are stronger in faith than others in this regard.  
Looking at the signs of Allah in the universe and the signs of Shari`ah (i.e., verses of the Quran and miracles of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), etc.). The more a person looks at the signs of Allah in the universe, the more he increases in faith. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):

“And on the earth are signs for those who have Faith with certainty. And also in your own selves. Will you not then see?.” [Al-Dhariyat 51:20-21]
The verses which indicate that are many, I mean the verses which indicate that by pondering and thinking about this universe, man can increase in faith. 
Doing many acts of worship, for the more acts of worship a person does, the more he will increase in faith thereby, whether those acts of worship involve words or actions. So dhikr increases faith in quantity and quality, and prayer, fasting and Hajj also increase faith in quantity and quality.

10777,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10777,Who are Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah?,Who are Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah are those who adhere to the Sunnah and who unite upon it, not turning to anything else, whether that be in matters of belief (‘aqeedah) or matters of actions which are subject to shar’i rulings. Hence they are called Ahl al-Sunnah because they adhere to it (the Sunnah), and they called Ahl al-Jamaa’ah because they are united (mujtami’oon) in following it. 
If you examine the followers of bid’ah (innovation), you will find that they differ concerning that which they are following, with regard to beliefs, methodology and practices, which indicates that their being far removed from the Sunnah is commensurate with the extent to which they have introduced innovations.","Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Rasaa’il Fadeelat al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him), vol. 1. p. 37"
10778,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10778,Uncertainty whilst making wudoo’,"Sometimes it so happens that I forget whether I have wiped over my head or not, and I am not sure one way or the other. Should I do wudoo’ all over again?",,,"Praise be to Allah.If this uncertainty come after you have finished 
          doing wudoo’, then do not pay any attention to it. If it happens before 
          you finish, for example, being unsure whether you have wiped over your 
          head and you are washing your feet, then you can wipe over your head 
          and wash your feet. There is no hardship involved in doing that. This 
          is if you are not  suffering from a lot of insinuating doubts. 
          If you are faced with a lot of insinuating doubts, then you should not 
          pay any attention to that, and you should proceed from the point at 
          which you are now. So if you are washing your feet then you may assume 
          that you have wiped over your head. The same applies to all other stages 
          of wudoo’.","I’laam al-Musaafireen bi Ba’d Aadaab wa Ahkaam al-Safar wa maa yakhuss al-Mallaaheen al-Jawwiyyeen, by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, p. 12"
10780,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10780,Forgot to Do Wudu and Prayed: Should I Repeat the Prayer?,"I forgot that I did not have wudu and I prayed. After I finished my prayer, I remembered that. Do I have to repeat my prayer?","Whoever prays forgetting that he does not have wudu has to repeat the prayer because the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: “Allah does not accept any prayer if a person breaks his wudu, until he does wudu.”",,"Praise be to Allah.Whoever prays forgetting that he does not have wudu has to repeat the prayer, because the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah does not accept any prayer if a person breaks his wudu , until he does wudu.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari from the hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) in Kitab al-Wudu)
This is in contrast to the person who has some impurity (najasah) on his clothes and he forgets it. He does not have to repeat his prayer because Jibril came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) whilst he was praying, and told him that there was something dirty on his shoes . He took them off and continued praying. This was narrated by Ahmad from the hadith of Abu Sa’id al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) in his Musnad. This hadith proves that the one who is unaware of the najasah does not have to repeat his prayer , and this applies also to the one who forgets that there is some najasah present.

10791,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/10791,Is video taping a wedding party haraam?,"Insha Allaah i am getting married soon and i would like to know if video taping the wedding would be haraam. I know that taking pictures via a camera is haraam but i would like to know if video taping falls under the same category as photography. There are people who would like us to video tape the wedding but my intended and i would not like to compromise with picture taking, so we were wondering if we could video tape it instead..",,,"Praise be to Allah.One of the evil actions that takes place during parties and celebrations is taking pictures of women. It is haraam whether the pictures are taken with a video camera or a regular camera, but taking pictures with a video camera is worse. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade one woman to describe another to her husband as if he can see her – as it says in al-Saheehayn – so taking pictures – especially on video – is undoubtedly worse than simply describing, because the woman can be seen in a real sense, not just in the imagination. 
This, naturally, applies if the pictures are of women only. But if the gathering is mixed then there is another sin as well as the sin of making pictures. Usually in women's gatherings on such occasions they compete in wearing short and revealing clothes. So taking such pictures and distributing them leads to the spread of immorality and sin and encourages such things, and makes people start to take the matter lightly. What should a woman do if she does not want her picture to be taken at all, then her picture is taken of her in all her finery? What should a woman do whom Allaah has guided after she went astray, and pictures of her at parties are in circulation? 
Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen said: 
In addition to the reservations about taking pictures at wedding parties as mentioned above, there is a very serious reservation which is: 
We have heard that some women bring cameras with them to take pictures of this celebration, and I do not know what justification these women have for taking pictures at these parties which are then spread among the people, intentionally or otherwise. Do those who take the pictures think that anyone approves of their actions? I do not think that anyone approves of what they do; I do not think that anyone would like his daughter’s or wife’s picture to be taken and kept by those misguided women to show to whomever they want, whenever they want? Would any of you agree for his mahrams’ pictures to be in the hands of other people, to be a source of mockery if they are ugly and a provocation of desire if they are beautiful? 
We have even heard of something that is worse than that: that some people bring a video camera to these parties to take moving pictures, and they watch it themselves or show it to others every time they want to enjoy looking at these scenes. 
We have also heard that some those who go to these parties and videotape them are young men, who mix with women at these parties or they sit alone with them, and no wise person who has any knowledge of the sources of sharee’ah will doubt that this is evil and is haraam, and that it is stooping to the lowest level of imitating the kuffaar. 
Friday Khutbah in the Jami’ Mosque of ‘Unayzah, entitled Munkaraat al-Afraah Mahaadhir Laylat al-Zafaaf. 
And the Shaykh also said: 
With regard to taking pictures of events, no wise person will doubt that this is reprehensible, and no wise person – let alone a believer – would agree to let his mahrams’ pictures be taken – mothers, daughters, sisters, wives – to be a product to be shown to everyone or be viewed for the enjoyment of any immoral person. 
Even worse than that is videotaping events, because this is like a living picture with sound. This is something that will be denounced by every person of sound mind and proper religious commitment, and we cannot imagine that anyone who has a sense of modesty and faith would allow it.

But if that is not possible, e.g. it is already the time for the latter of two prayers that may be joined, or it is a prayer which cannot be joined to the following prayer – such as ‘Asr and Maghrib, or ‘Ishaa’ and Fajr, or Fajr and Zuhr – then he should pray that according to his circumstances.","I’laam al-Musaafireen bi Ba’d Aadaab al-Safr wa ma yakhuss al-Mallaaheen al-Jawwiyyeen, by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, p. 11"
