65501,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/65501,Is it essential for him to stay with the imam until the end of Taraweeh prayer in order to be rewarded?,"One of the imams stated that it is essential to complete Taraweeh prayer with the imam and not to leave halfway through, because what you have done with him, whether it is two rak’ahs or four, will not count for you. Is this correct?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.This view is undoubtedly incorrect. It is not permissible for anyone to attribute to Islam something that is not part of it. Allaah has forbidden us to speak of Him without knowledge, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say (O Muhammad): (But) the things that my Lord has indeed forbidden are Al‑Fawaahish (great evil sins and every kind of unlawful sexual intercourse) whether committed openly or secretly, sins (of all kinds), unrighteous oppression, joining partners (in worship) with Allaah for which He has given no authority, and saying things about Allaah of which you have no knowledge”
[al-A’raaf 7:33]
Whoever stands with the imam until he has completed the prayer, it is equivalent to spending the whole night in prayer. 
It was narrated that Abu Dharr (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever stands with the imaam until he finishes, it is equivalent to spending the whole night in prayer.” 
Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 806; Abu Dawood, 1375; al-Nasaa’i, 1605; Ibn Maajah, 1327. Classed as saheeh by al-Tirmidhi, Ibn Khuzaymah (3/337), Ibn Hibbaan (3/340) and al-Albaani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel, 447. 
This reward (the reward of spending the whole night in prayer) is not attained by anyone except the one who stands with the imam for the whole prayer, until he completes it, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said. 
As for the one who prays as much as he can and then leaves before the imam has completed his prayer, only what he has prayed will be recorded for him, but it will not be recorded as if he spent the entire night in prayer. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So whosoever does good equal to the weight of an atom (or a small ant) shall see it.
8. And whosoever does evil equal to the weight of an atom (or a small ant) shall see it”
[al-Zalzalah 99:7-8]
Perhaps your imam wanted to say that but he expressed it incorrectly, or perhaps you did not really understand what he meant.

65506,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/65506,They allow mixing in the mosque because they want people to attend,"In our mosque , during ramadaan, around iftaar time, there is mixing between men and women. This has gone on for many years. The people who run the mosque use the excuse that if we do not let the people do what they want they won't come to the masjid. Also, during taraweeh they do many innovations, for example they do a tasbeeh after every four raka'aa. What advice can you give me to correct the situation?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
      Firstly: 

    Free mixing between men and women is haraam, because it leads 
    to many negative consequences and haraam things. We have quoted the evidence 
    for the prohibitions on mixing in the answer to question no. 
    1200. 

    As mixing is forbidden at all times and in all places, then 
    it is more emphatically forbidden if it is done in the mosques during the 
    month of Ramadaan, because it goes against the shar’i aims for which mosques 
    are established, such as maintaining and propagating Islam, calling people 
    to good and forbidding them to do corrupt and evil things. It also goes 
    against the reason for fasting, which is so that we might attain piety 
    (taqwa) and avoid whims and desires.  

    All the people of the mosque should denounce this evil and 
    strive to do away with it. Those who are in charge of the mosque are 
    especially responsible. 

    No one has the right to try to justify this evil or to remain 
    quiet about it on the grounds that not allowing mixing may cause some people 
    to refrain from coming to the mosque. This argument is to be rejected on 
    several fronts: 

    1 – Remaining quiet and not denouncing evil when one is able 
    to do so means that one is sinning. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever among you sees an evil act, let him 
    change it with his hand (by taking action); if he cannot, then with his 
    tongue (by speaking out); and if he cannot, then with his heart (by at least 
    hating it and regarding it as evil) – but that is the weakest of faith.” 
    Narrated by Muslim, 48. 

    No wise person would accept for his attendance at the mosque 
    to be a cause of his falling into sin. 

    2 – The most important role that the mosque plays is calling 
    people to goodness and warning them against evil. Hence those who are in 
    charge of the mosque must explain to the people that mixing is haraam, and 
    stop them doing it. 

    3 – The idea that these people will never attend the mosque 
    is merely conjecture. Even if we assume that it does happen, the established 
    principle among the scholars is that warding off evil takes precedence over 
    achieving good. 

    4 – A special place for women to gather can be set up, 
    whether it is in a particular corner of the mosque or even outside in a tent 
    or some such, and useful programs can be offered to them, which should be 
    supervised by women. 

    5 – The daa’iyah is the one who should affect how things are 
    and strive to set things right; he should not be affected by things and then 
    look for justification. 

    Mixing is a problem that has arisen because we are far away 
    from Islam. Efforts must be made to denounce it and put an end to it. If the 
    first step is not taken in the houses of Allaah, then where shall we begin?! 
     

    You can work with some of your brothers to convince the 
    people in charge and help them to prepare a place that is suitable for women 
    to meet, and help them to prepare suitable programs for the women. 

    We ask Allaah to bless your efforts with success. 

    Secondly: 

    With regard to what you say about tasbeeh after each four 
    rak’ahs of Taraweeh prayer, we have stated in the answer to question no. 
    50718 that this is an innovation which should not be done. 

    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: 
    What is the ruling on raising our voices in sending blessings upon the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and praying that 
    Allaah be pleased with the Rightly-Guided Caliphs between the rak’ahs of 
    Taraweeh? 

    He replied: 

    There is no basis for that – as far as we know – in 
    sharee’ah, rather it is an innovation and should not be done. The affairs of 
    the later generations of this ummah will never corrected except by that by 
    which the affairs of the earlier generations were corrected, which is 
    following the Qur’aan and Sunnah and the way of the earliest generations of 
    this ummah (the salaf), and avoiding whatever goes against that. End quote.

I was not sure whether that broke my fast, but I made up that day afterwards. Do I have to do anything else?",Popping pimples that appear on the face does not break your fast and you do not have to make up that day later on.,"What breaks your fast


Does popping a pimple break your fast?","Praise be to Allah.Bursting pimples that appear on the face does not invalidate the fast and does not require that day to be made up later on. 
What breaks your fast
The things that invalidate the fast are well known and are indicated by the Quran and the sahih Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). They are as follows: 

Intercourse
Masturbation
Eating and drinking
Things that take the place of eating and drinking, such as injections that provide nourishment
Vomiting deliberately
Cupping and things that are akin to it, such as donating blood
Menstruation and postpartum bleeding in the case of women

Does popping a pimple break your fast?
It is not permissible to say that this thing invalidates the fast without sound evidence to that effect, and there is no evidence that busting pimples or boils that appear on the body invalidates the fast. 
Based on this, your fast is valid and you do not have to make it up, but you will be rewarded for the day which you fasted to make it up, and that will count as a nafl (supererogatory) fast on your part. 
It should also be noted that you should refer to a doctor about bursting these pimples to find out whether it is harmful or not; if it is harmful then you should not do that.

65515,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/65515,Is the value of trade goods based on the selling price or the purchase price?,"When working out the zakah on trade goods, is it based on the purchase price or the selling price?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The value of trade goods is worked out at the end of the year, based on the price for which the owner would sell them. 
This is what is fair, for the value to be based on the selling price, which may be lower or higher than the purchase price, because at the end of the year, a person pays zakah on the wealth that he has. 
Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni (4/249) 
Whoever owns trade goods and one year has passed, and they reach the nisaab, should work out their value at the end of the year. If they reach the nisaab, he should pay zakah, which is one-quarter of one-tenth of their value. End quote. 
It says in al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (13/171): 
The trader should not work out the value of his trade goods on the basis of the price of one who is forced to sell his products. Rather he should base it on the price which he would get if he sold it without being under great pressure. End quote. 
So the values should be based on the selling price at the end of the year. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
In the case of land which is bought in order to be sold, the owners usually wait for the price to increase. These are trade goods, and the value of trade goods should be worked out when one year has passed, then one-quarter of one-tenth should be paid.  
It makes no difference whether the value of the land is the same as the price you bought it for or not. If we assume that a man bought some land for one hundred thousand, and when one year has passed it is worth two hundred thousand, then he must pay zakah on two hundred thousand. If the opposite happened, and he bought it for one hundred thousand and after one year has passed it is worth fifty thousand, then he only has to pay zakah on fifty thousand, because what matters is the value at the time when zakah becomes due. 
Majmoo’ Fatawa Ibn Uthaymeen, 18/205; see also 18/240 
The Standing Committee was asked: In the case of land that has been bought for trade, how should the zakah be worked out? Is it based on the purchase price or on the market value at the time when one year has passed and the zakah is due? 
They replied: 
Land which has been bought to sell comes under the heading of trade goods, and the general principle in Islamic sharee’ah is that the value of trade goods should be worked out after one year has passed, according to their market value, regardless of the purchase price, and regardless of whether the market price at the time when zakah becomes due is more or less. The zakah should be paid on their value, and the rate of zakah is one-quarter of one-tenth. In the case of land that is worth one thousand riyals, for example, the zakah is twenty-five riyals, and so on.""(Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 9/324) 
It also says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (9/319): 
The shar’i way is to evaluate the trade goods that one has at the end of the year according to their market value at the time when zakah becomes due, regardless of the purchase price. End quote. 
Based on this, if the trader sells wholesale or retail, the value of the goods that he has should be based on the price for which he sells them. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: It is known that what matters is the value of the goods at the time when zakah becomes due. But even at the time when zakah becomes due, the price varies between wholesale and retail. Should we look at the wholesale price or the retail price? 
He replied: 
If the trader deals in wholesale, he should look at the wholesale price, and if he deals in retail, he should look at the retail price.""(Majmoo’ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 18/233)

65517,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/65517,"A Christian is asking, what do you do during the month of Ramadaan?",What do you do during the month of fasting?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Allaah has singled out the month of Ramadaan with special virtues that are not present in any other month. It is the best of months. Allaah has the right to single out some months and nights and prefer them over others, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And your Lord creates whatsoever He wills and chooses”
[al-Qasas 28:68]
Allaah has placed in the month of Ramadaan Laylat al-Qadr (the Night of Decree), of which He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The Night of Al‑Qadr (Decree) is better than a thousand months”
[al-Qadr 97:3]
i.e., worship on that night brings a greater reward than worshipping for a thousand months; this is by the great bounty of Allaah towards this ummah (nation – i.e., the Muslims). 
Laylat al-Qadr occurs during the last ten nights of Ramadaan. Hence the Muslims strive hard in worship during these ten days more than at other times, seeking this blessed night. 
With regard to what we Muslims do in Ramadaan, we seek to draw closer to Allaah and strive hard in worship. Various kinds of worship have been prescribed for us, by which we seek to draw closer to Allaah. These include the following: 
1 –Fasting.  
This means refraining from food, drink, intercourse and sexual activity from dawn until sunset. We are not the only nation on whom God has enjoined fasting, rather there is no nation among the previous nations upon whom God did not enjoin fasting. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Observing As-Sawm (the fasting) is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, that you may become Al-Muttaqoon (the pious)”
[al-Baqarah 2:183]
2 – Prayers at night (Taraweeh) 
Praying at night (qiyaam al-layl) has a great effect in purifying and reforming hearts, and is also a means of forgiveness of sin. 
3 – Reading Qur’aan 
Ramadaan is the month of the Qur’aan, in which the revelation of the Qur’aan to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) first began. Hence you will find the Muslims reading the entire Qur’aan during Ramadaan, and some of them read the entire Book once or twice, or more than that. The Muslim knows that reading a single letter of the Qur’aan brings a tenfold reward, and that reading a single page brings a thousand rewards (hasanaat). 
4 – Charity and feeding the poor 
Our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was the most generous of people, and he was at his most generous in Ramadaan. 
Our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) encouraged us to feed the poor and to give fasting people food to break their fast. He told us that the reward of the one who gives food to a fasting person to break his fast is equivalent to the reward of the fasting person, without that detracting from the reward of the fasting person in the slightest. 
5 – Supplication 
Ramadaan is the month of supplication (du’aa’). It is mustahabb for the fasting person to make du’aa’, and the du’aa’ (supplication) of one who has fasted at the time of breaking the fast will not be rejected. 
6 – I’tikaaf (“retreat” for worship) 
This means staying in the mosque in order to devote oneself to worship of Allaah. It is Sunnah in the last ten days of Ramadaan, seeking Laylat al-Qadr. 
7 – Allaah has enjoined a special charity to be given at the end of Ramadaan. This is called Zakaat al-Fitr, by means of which the fasting person offers expiation for any idle or obscene speech he may have uttered during his fast; it is also a means of feeding and helping the poor. 
It is obligatory upon every Muslim, young and old, male and female. It is one of the ways of making people feel the unity, cohesion and mutual compassion of the Muslim community. 
8 – Allaah has also enjoined that those who have fasted should offer the Eid prayer, as a conclusion to these good deeds that they have done during Ramadaan, and as a way of bringing them together to express their joy and gratitude towards Allaah. 
The point is that the Muslim spends the month of Ramadaan in fasting, praying, offering night prayers (Taraweeh), remembering Allaah and reading Qur’aan, and has ended it with i’tikaaf and charity, as well as striving to uphold the ties of kinship and do good deeds, and spending a great deal for the sake of Allaah, and other righteous good deeds. Ramadaan is an occasion that is good for him, in which he does acts of worship and rids himself of the burdens of sin. On every night of Ramadaan Allaah frees people from Hell, overlooks their bad deeds and forgives their sins. Hence the month of Ramadaan is the most beloved of months to the Muslims, and they feel happy, joyful and content at this time, and they wish that the whole year was Ramadaan. 
Perhaps if you visit an Islamic Centre, you will see for yourself the happiness and joy that the Muslims, young and old, feel during Ramadaan. This is due to the effects of worship and obedience, as stated above. 
We ask Allaah to guide you to that which is good for you and will bring you happiness in this world and in the Hereafter.

65521,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/65521,It is not prescribed to probe too deeply when checking that there is no urine,"I would like to ask the following question is it right for a male muslim to open, touch or look at the channel of his private part through which urine comes out inorder to confirm if anything really came out of his private part or just looking at the surface of d private part would be sufficient .what if he sees traces of whitish liquid deep in d or in d channel would his wudu or fast still be valid since the liquid did not reach the outer surface of the private part . "".",,,"Praise be to Allah.
      It is not prescribed for a man to examine the channel of 
      his private part or to look into it in order to make sure that there is no 
      urine there. This is a kind of exaggeration and going to extremes, which 
      is contrary to the easy nature of sharee’ah and is also a kind of waswasah 
      (whisper from the Shaytaan). What is prescribed is to wash the tip of the 
      penis after one has finished urinating. 

    It is also prescribed to sprinkle some water over the private 
    part so as to ward off the waswasah. 
Ibn Maajah (464) narrated 
    that Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did wudoo’ and sprinkled 
    his private part. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah. 

    It says in al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (4/125): 
The Hanafis, Shaafa’is 
    and Hanbalis stated that when a person has finished washing his private part 
    with water (istinja’), it is mustahabb for him to sprinkle his private part 
    or his trousers with a little water, so as to prevent waswaas, because when 
    he feels any wetness he will think that it is because of the water that he 
    sprinkled, unless he is certain of the contrary. End quote. 

    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    said in Majmoo’ al-Fataawa (21/106): 
With regard to thoroughly 
    inspecting the penis by squeezing it etc, all of that is an innovation which 
    is neither required nor recommended according to the imams of the Muslims. 
    Similarly, pulling the penis is also an innovation according to the correct 
    view, and that was not prescribed by the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him).  

    Squeezing out urine is also an innovation which was not 
    enjoined by the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him). The hadeeth which is narrated concerning that is da’eef (weak) 
    and has no basis. Urine comes out naturally, and when it stops naturally, it 
    is as they say, like an udder: if you leave it alone, it will settle down, 
    but if you pull at it, it will flow. 

    Every time a person opens his penis, something will come out 
    of it, whereas if he leaves it alone nothing will come out. He may even 
    imagine that something has come out – which is waswaas. If the tip of his 
    penis touches his clothes when they are cold, he may think that something 
    has come out when it has not. 

    There may be urine at the base of penis and if the penis or 
    private part is squeezed with a rock or finger, etc., some wetness may come 
    out. This is also an innovation. That standing urine does not need to be 
    expelled, according to the consensus of the scholars, whether with a stone, 
    a finger or anything else. Rather every time it comes out, more comes, 
    because it keeps leaking all the time. Cleaning oneself with stones 
    (istijmaar) is sufficient and there is no need to also wash the penis with 
    water. But it is mustahabb for the one who cleans himself with water 
    (istinja’) to sprinkle some water on his private part, then if he feels some 
    wetness he can say that it is from this water. End quote. 

    If the urine does not reach the outside, then it is not 
    subject to any ruling and does not have any effect on wudoo’ or prayer. As 
    for fasting, it is not affected by the emission of urine and a person does 
    not become naajis thereby.

      Firstly: 

    We are very happy to learn of this good example of Muslim 
    youth. Whilst other youngsters think only of play and entertainment, and 
    spending their time in things that are of no benefit, along comes this good 
    example of Muslim youth who loves to worship Allaah, seek knowledge, call 
    others to Allaah and strive to learn the Qur’aan and Sunnah. We congratulate 
    you and pray that Allaah will make you steadfast in adhering to His religion 
    and will protect you and make you a joy to your parents. 

    You should note that when the Shaytaan sees a person turning 
    towards his Lord, he tries to stop him. The Shaytaan has sworn to undertake 
    this evil mission, but Allaah tells us that he has no power over His sincere 
    slaves. 

    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “[Iblees (Satan)] said: ‘O my Lord! Because You misled me, I 
    shall indeed adorn the path of error for them (mankind) on the earth, and I 
    shall mislead them all.

    40. ‘Except Your chosen, (guided) slaves among them.’

    41. (Allaah) said: ‘This is the Way which will lead straight 
    to Me.’

    42. ‘Certainly, you shall have no authority over My slaves, 
    except those who follow you of the Ghaawoon (Mushrikoon and those who go 
    astray, criminals, polytheists, and evildoers)’”

    [al-Hijr 15:39-42]
It should be noted that 
    the Shaytaan can do no more than call people to misguidance and make it look 
    attractive to them. He has no power over them to force them to do what he 
    wants. So blame is attached only to those who respond to him. 

    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And Shaytaan (Satan) 
    will say when the matter has been decided: ‘Verily, Allaah promised you a 
    promise of truth. And I too promised you, but I betrayed you. I had no 
    authority over you except that I called you, and you responded to me. So 
    blame me not, but blame yourselves. I cannot help you, nor can you help me. 
    I deny your former act in associating me (Satan) as a partner with Allaah 
    (by obeying me in the life of the world). Verily, there is a painful torment 
    for the Zaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers)’”

    [Ibraaheem 14:22]

    Worshipping and obeying Allaah impedes the tricks and 
    whispers of the Shaytaan, and remembrance of Allaah (dhikr) is a strong 
    fortress by means of which Allaah protects the one who remembers Him from 
    the plots and wiles of the Shaytaan. 
It was narrated from Anas 
    ibn Maalik that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said: “When a man leaves his house and says, ‘Bismillaah, tawakkaltu ‘ala 
    Allaah wa laa hawla wa laa quwwata illa Billaah (In the name of Allaah, 
    I put my trust in Allaah, and there is no power and not strength except with 
    Allaah), it is said: ‘You have been guided, taken care of and protected,’ 
    and the devils turn away from him. And another devil says to him: ‘What you 
    can do with a man who has been guided, taken care of and protected?’” 
Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 
    3423; Abu Dawood, 5095; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi 
    Dawood. 
The Shaytaan has no power 
    over a heart that knows Allaah, or over physical faculties that have 
    submitted to Allaah by doing acts of worship and obedience and by avoiding 
    sin. The light of obedience burns the devils as the shooting stars burn 
    their brethren. 
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah 
    have mercy on him) said: 
Worship and obedience 
    illuminate the heart and make it strong and steadfast, until it becomes like 
    a clear mirror, shining with light. When the Shaytaan draws close, he is 
    struck by its light like those who try to eavesdrop (in the heavens) are 
    struck by the shooting stars, and the Shaytaan flees from this heart with 
    more terror than a wolf fleeing from a lion. End quote.

 Secondly: 
Worshipping Allaah in 
    one’s youth is a sign that a person is good. The Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) spoke of the great virtue of a young man 
    who grows up worshipping and obeying Allaah, and said that he will be shaded 
    by Allaah on the Day of Resurrection, the Day when the sun will be directly 
    over the heads of the people. 
It was narrated from Abu 
    Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There are seven whom Allaah will 
    shade with His shade on the Day when there will be no shade but His…” among 
    whom he mentioned, “a young man who grew up worshipping Allaah.” Narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari, 1423; Muslim, 1031. 
Whoever keeps his 
    physical faculties away from sin when he is young, Allaah will protect him 
    when he gets older. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said to Ibn ‘Abbaas when he was a young boy: “Be mindful of Allaah and 
    He will take care of you.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2516; classed as saheeh 
    by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali (may 
    Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
Whoever is mindful of 
    Allaah when he is young and strong, Allaah will take care of him when he is 
    old and has become weak, and will bless him with good hearing, eyesight, 
    strength and reasoning. One of the scholars who lived beyond the age of one

      Insulting Allaah or Islam is major kufr which puts a person 
      beyond the pale of Islam. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say: Was it at Allaah

    him, and warn him that all his good deeds are to no avail, and that if he 
    does not repent, he will meet Allaah when he is guilty of major kufr. 

    Tell him that the punishment that he deserves in this world 
    is execution, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be

    It should be noted that bad company will bring nothing but 
    evil, so protect yourself against that. The Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) likened a bad companion to the one who 
    operates the bellows: either he will burn your clothes, or you will notice a 
    foul smell from him. 

    It was narrated from Abu Moosa (may Allaah be pleased with 
    him) that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “The likeness of a good companion and a bad companion is that of one who 
    carries musk and one who works the bellows. With the carrier of musk, either 
    he will give you some or you will buy some from him, or you will notice a 
    good smell from him; as for the one who works the bellows, either he will 
    burn your clothes or you will notice a bad smell from him.” Narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari, 5543; Muslim, 2628. 

    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    In this hadeeth the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) likened a good companion to the one who carries musk, 
    and the bad companion to one who works the bellows. It points to the virtue 
    of sitting with righteous, good and honourable people, people of good

Are there any simple religious ideas which can be used to fill children’s spare time in Ramadan?",The age at which parents should start to teach their children to fast is the age at which they are able to fast. Some scholars have defined this as being ten years of age.,"When should children start fasting?


Ramadan fasting tips for children


How to fill children’s spare time in Ramadan","Praise be to Allah.When should children start fasting?
Fasting is not obligatory for young children , until they reach the age of adolescence. Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The pens have been lifted from three: from one who has lost his mind until he comes back to his senses, from one who is sleeping until he wakes up, and from a child until he reaches the age of adolescence.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 4399; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud) 
Nevertheless, children should be told to fast so that they can get used to it, and because the good deeds that they do will be recorded for them. 
The age at which parents should start to teach their children to fast is the age at which they are able to fast, which will vary according to each child’s physical makeup. Some scholars have defined this as being ten years of age. 
Al-Kharqi said: 
“When a child is ten years old and is able to fast, he should start to do so.” 
Ibn Qudamah said: 
“This means that he should be made to fast and told to do so. And he should be smacked if he does not do it, so as to train him and make him get used to it, just as he should be made to pray and told to do it. Among those who were of the view that a child should be told to fast when he becomes able to do it were ‘Ata, al-Hasan, Ibn Sirin, al-Zuhri, Qatadah and al-Shafi’i. 
Al-Awza’i said: If he is able to fast for three consecutive days without interruption and without becoming weak, then he should be made to fast Ramadan. Ishaq said: When (a child) reaches the age of twelve I think that he should be made to fast so that he gets used to it. 
The age of ten is more likely, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoined smacking children for not praying at this age, and regarding fasting as being like prayer is better, because they are close to one another, and because they are both physical actions that are pillars of Islam. But fasting is harder, so attention should be paid to when the child becomes able to do it, because some may be able to pray but are not yet able to fast.” (Al-Mughni, 4/412) 
This is what the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did with their children; they would tell those who were able to fast to do so, and if one of them wept because of hunger, they would give him a toy to distract him, but it is not permissible to force them to fast if it will harm them in cases of physical weakness or sickness. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said: 
“A young child should not be forced to fast until he has reached the age of adolescence, but he may be told to fast if he is able to do it, so that he may get used to it and it will be easier for him after he reaches puberty. The Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) – who are the best of this ummah – used to make their children fast when they were young.” (Majmu’ Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 19/28, 29) 
And the Shaykh (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: 
My young son insists on fasting Ramadan even though fasting is harmful for him because he is so young and his health is not good. Should I use force with him to make him break his fast?
He replied: 
“If he is young and has not yet reached puberty, he is not obliged to fast, but if he is able to do it without hardship, then he should be told to do so. The Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) used to make their children fast, and if the younger ones cried they would give them toys to distract them. But if it is proven that it is harmful to him, then he should be stopped from fasting. If Allah has forbidden us to give youngsters their wealth if there is the fear that they may abuse it, then it is more appropriate that they be stopped from doing something if there is the fear of physical harm. But that should not be done by force, because that is not appropriate in raising children.” (Majmu’ Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 19/83) 
Ramadan fasting tips for children
The parents can encourage their children to fast by giving them a gift each day, or by exploiting the spirit of competition between them and their peers or those who are younger than them. They can encourage them to pray by taking them to pray in the mosques, especially if they go out with their father and pray in different mosques each day. They can also encourage them by rewarding them for that, whether that is by praising them or by taking them out on trips sometimes, or buying things that they like, etc. 
Unfortunately some fathers and mothers fall far short in encouraging their children, and there are even some who stop their children doing these acts of worship. Some of these fathers and mothers think that mercy and compassion mean not making their children fast or pray. This is completely mistaken according to both the Shar`i point of view and educational wisdom. 
Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Allah has enjoined fasting upon every Muslim who is accountable, able to do it and not travelling. As for young children who have not yet reached the age of puberty, fasting is not obligatory for them, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The pen has been lifted from three” and he mentioned young children until they reach puberty. But the child’s guardian must tell him to fast if he reaches an age where he is able to do so, because that comes under the heading of training him to implement the pillars of Islam. We see some people leaving their children alone and not telling them to pray or fast, but this is wrong, and he (the parent) will be responsible for that before Allah. They say that they do not make their children fast out of kindness and compassion towards them, but in fact the one who is truly kind and compassionate towards his child is the one who trains him to acquire good characteristics and to do righteous deeds, not the one who refrains from disciplining and training him in a beneficial manner.” (Majmu’ Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 19/19, 20) 
How to fill children’s spare time in Ramadan 
The parents can fill their children’s time with reading Quran and memorizing a small portion each day, reading books that are suited to their level, letting them listen to tapes which combine useful content with fun, such as nashids, and bringing them video tapes that are useful for them. The “al-Majd for Children” channel does all of these things, and time can be set aside each day for children to watch it and benefit from it. 
We would like to express our appreciation for our sister’s concern about her children’s upbringing. This indicates that there is still goodness in Muslim families. But many people do not do well in bringing out their children’s intellectual and physical potential, and they become lazy and depend on others. They also do not care about encouraging them to do acts of worship such as fasting and praying, so many children grow up in this manner and their hearts are devoid of worship after they grow older, and it becomes difficult for their parents to direct them and advise them, whereas if they had paid attention to this matter from the outset, they would not have ended up regretting it in the end. 
We ask Allah to help us to raise our children well, to make them love worship, and to help us to fulfil our duties towards them.

Praying ‘Isha behind one who is praying Tarawih","Praise be to Allah.Tarawih time
Qiyam and Witr can only be prayed after praying ‘Isha. So you should have prayed ‘Isha first and then prayed qiyam and Witr after that. 
Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmu’ (3/526): 
“The time for Tarawih begins when ‘Isha prayer is over, as was stated by al-Baghawi and others, and lasts until dawn comes.”
It says in al-Insaf (4/166): 
“The time for it (i.e., Tarawih) begins after ‘Isha prayer and its Sunnahs, according to the correct view. This is the view of the majority and is the practice of the Muslims.”
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said: 
“The time for Tarawih is from after ‘Isha prayer until dawn comes.” Majmu’ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 14/210 
Praying ‘Isha behind one who is praying Tarawih
Based on this, what should a person do if he comes to the mosque late, when the imam has already finished ‘Isha and has started Tarawih? 
The correct view is that he should join the imam, with the intention of praying ‘Isha, and he should stand to complete his prayer (i.e., four rak’ahs) after the imam says the salam. Then he should join him in the remainder of the Tarawih prayer.” 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
There is nothing wrong with praying ‘Isha behind one who is praying Tarawih . Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) stated that if a man enters the mosque in Ramadan when they are praying Tarawih, he should pray behind the imam with the intention of praying ‘Isha, then when the imam says the salam at the end of the prayer, he should complete whatever remains of ‘Isha prayer.” (Majmu’ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 12/443-445)

A person may recite a Surah in the first Rak`ah and repeat the same Surah in the second.",,"Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with repeating the same Surah in Tarawih prayer, or in any other prayer. A person may recite a Surah in the first Rak`ah and repeat the same Surah in the second. The evidence for that is the general meaning of the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Indeed, your Lord knows, [O Muḥammad], that you stand [in prayer] almost two thirds of the night or half of it or a third of it, and [so do] a group of those with you. And Allāh determines [the extent of] the night and the day. He has known that you [Muslims] will not be able to do it and has turned to you in forgiveness, so recite what is easy [for you] of the Quran.” [Al-Muzzammil 73:20] 
Abu Dawud narrated (816) from Mu`adh ibn `Abdullah Al-Juhani (may Allah have mercy on him) that a man from Juhaynah told him that he heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) reciting Idha Zulzilat Al-Ard [Az-Zalzalah 99] in both Rak`ahs of Fajr prayer and (he said) I do not know whether the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forgot or he recited that deliberately. This report was classified as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih Abu Dawud. 
`Abd Al-`Adhim Abadi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“The Companions were uncertain as to whether the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) repeated the Surah because he forgot, as it was his habit to recite a different Surah in the second Rak`ah to what he had recited in the first, so that was not prescribed for his Ummah, or he did it deliberately to show that it is permissible. So it is uncertain as to whether it is permissible to repeat a Surah or not. If it is not clear whether it is permissible or not, then it is more appropriate to interpret what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did as meaning that it is permissible, because the basic principle concerning his actions is that they were done to show what is prescribed, and the idea that he forgot goes against that principle.” (`Awn Al-Ma`bud, 3/23)
Indeed, there is nothing wrong with repeating a Surah or a verse within the same Rak`ah. 
An-Nasa’i (1010) and Ibn Majah (1350) narrated that Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stood reciting a verse and repeating it until morning came. That verse was (interpretation of the meaning): “If You punish them, they are Your slaves, and if You forgive them, verily, You, only You, are the All-Mighty, the All-Wise” [Al-Ma'idah 5:118]. (Classed as good by Al-Albani in Sahih An-Nasa’i) 
Al-Bukhari (5014) narrated from Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) that a man heard another man reciting “Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad (Say (O Muhammad): He is Allah, (the) One)” [Al-Ikhlas 112] and repeating it. The next day he came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and told him about that, and it was as if the man did not think much of that. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “By the One in Whose hand is my soul, it is equivalent to one-third of the Quran.”  
According to another report: A man stood at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) reciting “Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad (Say (O Muhammad): He is Allah, (the) One)” [Al-Ikhlas 112] at the end of the night, and he did not do more than that, but the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) approved of his repeating the same Surah. 
Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“The one who recited it was Qatadah ibn An-Nu`man. Ahmad narrated via Abu Al-Haytham that Abu Sa`id said: Qatadah ibn An-Nu`man stayed up for the whole night, reciting “Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad (Say (O Muhammad): He is Allah, (the) One)” [Al-Ikhlas 112] and he did not recite anything else…. And Ad-Daraqutni narrated another version of this Hadith via Is-haq ibn At-Tabba’ from Malik, in which it says: “I had a neighbour who would spend the night in prayer and would not recite anything other than “Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad (Say (O Muhammad): He is Allah, (the) One)” [Al-Ikhlas 112].”

65567,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/65567,She neglected the birds until they died – has she committed a sin?,"We used to raise birds, and my mother used to feed them, but she heard that it was wrong to go near the birds during her period, so she told me to feed them. But I was scared of them because sometimes they bite. I used to forget sometimes, until I forgot them altogether and they died. How can we expiate for what we did?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
      Firstly: 

    There is no basis for the belief that it is not permissible 
    for a woman to go near the birds during her period. There is no connection 
    between the two matters. What you must do is give up such beliefs. There are 
    certain rulings which apply to the menstruating woman but such matters are 
    not among them and are not at all connected to them. 

    The scholars are unanimously agreed that it is permissible 
    for a woman to slaughter animals (for food) when she is menstruating. See 
    al-Mughni, 13/311. 

    Secondly: 
Everyone who keeps these 
    birds or any other creatures is obliged to take good care of them. If he is 
    not able to do that then he should not keep them, and he should sell them or 
    slaughter them if they are the kinds of animals or birds that can be eaten. 
    There is a stern warning issued to the one who keeps an animal and does not 
    feed it or give it water until it dies. 

    Ibn Qudaamah al-Maqdisi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    Whoever owns an animal must take care of it and spend on 
    whatever it needs of food or appoint someone else to look after it, because 
    of the report narrated by Ibn ‘Umar, who said that the Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “A woman was punished because of 
    a cat which she detained until it died of starvation, because she did not 
    feed it or let it go and eat of the vermin of the earth.” Agreed upon. If he 
    refuses to spend on it, he should be forced to do so; if he refuses or is 
    unable to do that, he should be forced to sell it or to slaughter it if it 
    is an animal that may be slaughtered (for food). End quote.

    Al-Mughni, 8/205 

    Al-Shawkaani said, commenting on the hadeeth about the woman 
    who detained the cat: 
It is understood from 
    this hadeeth that it is haraam to detain cats and similar animals without 
    giving them food and water, because this is tormenting the creation of 
    Allaah, which has been forbidden by the Lawgiver… al-Nawawi said: It seems 
    that she (this woman) was a Muslim, but she entered the Fire because of this 
    sin. End quote. 

    Nayl al-Awtaar, 7/7 

    It says in al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (5/119, 120): 
It is permissible to keep 
    animals for beneficial purposes, such as guarding (property etc), listening 
    to their voices and enjoying looking at them, but the one who keeps them is 
    obliged to give them food and drink, because of the sanctity of life. End 
    quote. 

    In the answer to question no. 48008 it says: 

    It is permissible to keep birds and similar creatures in 
    cages for pleasure, especially if that is because of their appearance or 
    their voices, subject to the condition that one feeds them and gives them 
    water. End quote.   

    See question no. 48008 for more detailed information. 

    Thirdly: 

    If your excuse for not feeding these birds until they died is 
    that you forgot and did not do it deliberately, then this is an excuse which 
    is acceptable according to sharee’ah. We ask Allaah to forgive you for that. 
    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Allaah burdens not a person beyond his scope. He gets 
    reward for that (good) which he has earned, and he is punished for that 
    (evil) which he has earned. ‘Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall 
    into error…’”

    [al-Baqarah 2:286]
And Allaah has answered 
    this prayer of the believers and says, “I have done that,” as was narrated 
    by Muslim (126) from the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with 
    him). 

    And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And there is no sin on you concerning that in which you 
    made a mistake, except in regard to what your hearts deliberately intend”

    [al-Ahzaab 33:5]

    Since you did not deliberately intend to kill them, there is 
    no sin on you, in sha Allaah.

      There is no definitive evidence in sharee’ah to prove the 
      minimum or maximum length of menses. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was asked: Is 
      there a definitive number of days for the minimum or maximum length of 
      menses? 

    He replied: 

    There is no definitive number of days for the minimum or 
    maximum length of menses, because Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 
“They ask you concerning 
    menstruation. Say: that is an Adha (a harmful thing for a husband to have a 
    sexual intercourse with his wife while she is having her menses), therefore, 
    keep away from women during menses and go not unto them till they are 
    purified (from menses and have taken a bath)”

    [al-Baqarah 2:222]
So Allaah did not make 
    the period of abstention a certain number of days, rather He stated that the 
    period of abstention ends when the woman becomes pure. This indicates that 
    the reason for the ruling is menstruation, and whether it is present or not. 
    When menstruation is present, the ruling applies, and when the period ends 
    the attendant rulings no longer apply. Moreover there is no evidence for 
    putting a time limit on menses, even though there was a need (at the time of 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)) to explain the 
    definition if any such definition had existed. If there was such a 
    definition, it would have been explained in the Book of Allaah or the Sunnah 
    of His Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Based on 
    this, every time a woman sees the kind of blood which is known to women as 
    being menstrual blood, then it is menstrual blood without that being 
    restricted to a certain time, unless the bleeding is continuous and never 
    stops, or it stops only for a short time such as one or two days in the 
    month, in which case it is istihaadah (non-menstrual vaginal bleeding). 

    Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 
    11/271 
Based on this, it is not 
    permissible for you to pray except after the period has ended and you have 
    done ghusl (full ablution). The ending of menstruation may be known from one 
    of two signs: either the emission of a white discharge which comes at the 
    end of the period, or by total cessation of bleeding.

It is proven in al-Sahihayn that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) led his Companions in prayer (Tarawih ) for several nights, then on the third or fourth night he did not come out to them.

According to the version narrated by Muslim (761): “But I feared that night prayers would be made obligatory for you and you would not be able to do them.” 
Offering Tarawih prayer in congregation
Offering Tarawih prayer in congregation is something that is established by the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stated the reason why he did not persist in offering this prayer in congregation, which is that he feared that it might be made obligatory. This reason ceased to be applicable after the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) died, because when he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) died, the revelation ceased and there was no longer any worry that it might be made obligatory. Once the reason, which was the fear of it being made obligatory, disappeared with the cessation of the revelation, then the fact that it is Sunnah to offer this prayer in congregation resumed.  (See al-Sharh al-Mumti’ by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 4/78) 
Imam Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“This indicates that praying qiyam in Ramadan is one of the Sunnahs of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and is recommended and encouraged. It was not introduced by ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab, rather he revived something that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) loved and approved of. Nothing stopped him from doing it regularly except the fear that it might be made obligatory upon his ummah. He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was kind and compassionate towards his ummah. ‘Umar knew from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that the obligatory duties would not be increased or decreased after his death (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), so he revived this practice and enjoined it upon the people. That happened in 14 AH, and ‘Umar has the honour of being the one who revived this Sunnah.” (Al-Tamhid, 8/108, 109) 
After the death of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) prayed Tarawih in small groups and individually, until ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) united them behind a single imam. 
It was narrated that ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn ‘Abd al-Qari said: I went out with ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) one night in Ramadan to the mosque , and the people were scattered, with one man praying by himself and another with a group of men following his prayer. ‘Umar said: “I think that if I gather them behind one reader, it will be better.” Then he decided to unite them behind Ubayy ibn Ka’b. Then I went out with him on another night, and the people were praying behind their reader. ‘Umar said: “What a good innovation this is. But the prayer that they forget about and sleep is better than the one they are offering.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1906) 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said, when refuting the view of those who quoted ‘Umar’s words “What a good innovation this is” as meaning that innovation (bid`ah) is permissible: 
With regard to qiyam in Ramadan , the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) introduced this to his ummah, and he led them in prayer for a number of nights, because at his time they used to pray in congregation and individually. But he did not persist in leading them in one congregation, lest that be made obligatory for them. 
When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) died, the Shari`ah was established (and would not change after that). When ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) became caliph, he united them behind one imam, Ubayy ibn Ka’b, who united the people in one congregation on the orders of ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him). ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) was one of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs, of whom the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I urge you to adhere to my Sunnah and the way of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs after me; cling tightly to it.” So what he did was Sunnah but he said, “What a good innovation this is,” because it was an innovation in the linguistic sense, as they were doing something that they had not done during the life of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), i.e., gathering to do this, but it is Sunnah in the Shar`i sense.”  (Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 22/234, 235) 
Is completing the Quran in Ramadan sunnah?
Completing the Quran in Ramadan , whether during prayer or outside prayer, is something that is praiseworthy. Jibril (peace be upon him) used to review the Quran with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) every Ramadan, and in the Prophet’s last year he reviewed it with him twice.

I believe you're supposed to read it 70 times at the time of each salah and the rewards include something like hajj and umra for every vein of the body. If you could please please provide me with that dua'a as well as the translation, benefits, and hadith or whatever authenticity, i would really really appreciate it. I've been looking and I know I have it but somewhere, but I can't seem to find it.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
We do not know of any du`a in the saheeh Sunnah that is like the one mentioned by our sister. 
It is not permissible for anyone to attribute to the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) things that he did not say. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever tells lies about me deliberately, let him take his place in Hell.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1291; Muslim, 933. 
Not every hadeeth that a person hears or reads in a book is saheeh, rather he must verify whether the hadeeth was indeed narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and it should be taken from trustworthy scholars who have sound knowledge of the hadeeth of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
It was narrated by Muslim in the introduction to his Saheeh (5), and by Abu Dawood (4992) that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “It is sufficient lying for a man to speak of everything that he hears.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
Al-Nawawi said: 
Because usually he hears both true and false things, and if he were to speak of everything that he hears, he would be lying because he would be telling of something that did not happen. End quote. 
Secondly: 
It is permissible for a menstruating woman to remember Allah by reciting whatever du`a’s and dhikrs she wants; there is no reason why she should not do that. And it is permissible for her to recite Qur’aan, as is the view of Abu Haneefah and the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam (may Allah have mercy on them both). 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 26/190: 
There is no basis for saying that she (a menstruating woman) is not allowed to recite Qur’aan. The quotation, “The menstruating woman and the one who is junub should not recite Qur’aan” is a weak hadeeth, according to the consensus of the scholars who have knowledge of hadeeth. 
Women used to menstruate at the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and if reciting was haraam, as prayer is, this would have been something to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) drew the attention of his ummah, and the Mother of the Believers would have known it, and that would have been something that was transmitted to the people. Since no one narrated any such prohibition from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), it is not permissible to make it haraam when it is known that he did not forbid it. Since he did not forbid it even though there were plenty of menstruating women around at his time, then it is known that it is not haraam. End quote. 
But she should recite Qur’aan without touching the Mus-haf, either by reciting what she knows by heart, or reading from the Mus-haf whilst wearing gloves or something similar that will prevent her from touching the Mus-haf directly.

One of the most well-known u`as regarding this matter is the u`a which is written at the end of many Mus-hafs and it attributed to Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him), but there is no basis for attributing it to him. See Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 14/226. 
The u`a after completing the Quran is recited either after completing it whilst praying, or when not praying. There is no basis for reciting any u`a after completing it whilst praying. As for reciting a u`a after completing it when not praying, it is narrated that Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) did that. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the ruling on making u`a after completing the Quran in night prayers in Ramadaan?  
He replied: 
I do not know of any u`a for completing the Quran in night prayers in Ramadaan, either from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or from his companions. The most that has been narrated concerning that is that when Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah have mercy on him) had completed a reading of the Quran, he would gather his family and make u`a. This had to do with reading it outside of prayer. End quote. 
Fataawa Arkaan al-Islam, p. 354 
Shaykh Bakr Abu Zayd wrote a useful essay on this issue, at the end of which he said: 
From the quotations in the two previous sections we may draw the following conclusion: 
1 – u`a upon completion of the Quran in general: 
The conclusion concerning this is as follows: 
Firstly: 
What we have stated above has to do with u`a upon completion of the Quran in general. 
There is no proof that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did that, rather the reports are either mawdoo’ (fabricated) or are da’eef (weak) with no other reports to strengthen them. It is almost certain that there are no marfoo’ reports concerning this matter that can be relied upon, because the scholars who wrote comprehensively about the sciences of the Quran and the dhikrs to be recited in connection with the Quran, such as al-Nawawi, Ibn Katheer, al-Qurtubi and al-Suyooti, did not narrate anything other than what we have referred to above. If they had known of any reports with stronger isnaads, they would have quoted them.
Secondly: 
There is a saheeh report that Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) said u`a when he completed the Quran, and he would gather his family and children for that, and that a number of the Taabi’een followed him in that, as mentioned in the report of Mujaahid ibn Jabr (may Allah have mercy on them all). 
Thirdly: 
There is no suggestion in the texts of Imam Abu Haneefah and Imam al-Shaafa’i (may Allah have mercy on them) that this is Islamically prescribed. 
What is narrated from Imam Maalik (may Allah have mercy on him) is that this is not something that the people did, and that completing the Quran in night prayers in Ramadaan is not Sunnah. 
Fourthly: 
The view that it is mustahabb to make u`a after completing the Quran is what is narrated from Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him), as our Hanbali scholars narrated from him, and as was affirmed by some later scholars of the other three madhhabs. 
2 – u`a following completion of the Quran in prayer 
This may be summed up as follows:  
Firstly: 
From what is quoted above, there is no one letter from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or from one of his companions (may Allah be pleased with them) to indicate that it is Islamically prescribed to recite this u`a in prayer after completing the Quran, before or after bowing, whether that is done by an imam or by one who is praying alone. 
Secondly: 
The closest we can find on this matter is what was quoted by the scholars of our madhhab from the report from Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him), according to the report of Hanbal, al-Fadl and al-Harbi, the isnaad of which we cannot find, about saying the u`a for completing the Quran in Taraweeh prayer before bowing. 
According to another report narrated from him – the source of which is not known – he allowed it in the u`a of Witr.

65593,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/65593,She saw the tuhr then she had some discharge – what should she do?,"My period lasted six days and on the sixth day the bleeding stopped. I used a piece of tissue to make sure, and a little bit of white discharge was coming out. So I did ghusl and my husband had intercourse with me that night, then I did ghusl and fasted (as it was Ramadaan). Then at Zuhr time I noticed some discharge in which there was a slight amount of red or yellow. I do not know what the ruling is. Do I have to make up that day or not?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
      We do not know what you mean by “a little bit of white 
      discharge was coming out.” If what you mean is that you saw the white 
      discharge which is the sign of purity (tuhr), then whatever yellowish or 
      reddish discharge comes out after that is not regarded as menses, because 
      Umm ‘Atiyyah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: “We did not regard the 
      brownish or yellowish discharge after the tuhr as being anything that 
      mattered.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 307; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in
      Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
Based on this, your 
    prayer is valid, and there is nothing wrong with your having had 
    intercourse, because you were not menstruating. 

    But if what you mean is that you saw that the discharge was 
    still yellowish or reddish, this means that the menses had not yet ended. A 
    woman should not be hasty in deciding that the period has ended when she 
    sees yellowish or reddish discharge, no matter how little it is. The women 
    used to send pieces of cloth to ‘Aa’ishah with yellowish discharge on them, 
    and she would say, “Do not be hasty until you see the white discharge.” 
    Narrated by Maalik, 130. 

    Pieces of cloth refers to what women use to check whether 
    there is any trace of menses left or not. 

    See also question no. 
    66062. 

    Based on this, then you have to make up that day, because it 
    is not correct to fast when one is menstruating. 

    With regard to intercourse, there is no sin on you in sha 
    Allaah, because you thought that your period had ended, and you did not 
    deliberately commit a haraam action. Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning):

     “And there is no sin on you concerning that in which you 
    made a mistake, except in regard to what your hearts deliberately intend”

    Firstly: 

    There is no doubt that the Sunnah is for the worshipper to 
    place his right hand over his left when praying. 

    It was narrated that Sahl ibn Sa’d (may Allaah be pleased 
    with him) said: The people were commanded to place the right hand over the 
    left forearm when praying. 

    Abu Haazim said: All I know is that he attributed this to the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari, 707. 

    It was narrated from Waa’il ibn Hujr (may Allaah be pleased 
    with him) that he saw the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) raising his hands level with his ears when he started to pray and 
    saying takbeer, then he wrapped himself in his garment and placed his right 
    hand on his left. Narrated by Muslim, 401. 

    See also the answer to question no. 
    5770 for information on 
    the true nature of the religion of the Raafidis, in which we have quoted the 
    saheeh evidence for placing the right hand on the left in prayer. 

    In the answer to question no. 
    6109 you will find a refutation 
    of those who quote Imam Maalik as going against this Sunnah, in which some 
    senior Maalikis clearly affirm that this is the Sunnah of the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and was the way of Imam Maalik. 

    Secondly: 

    If a person feels tired, he may let his arms drop for as long 
    as he needs to rest them, then he should go back to holding the right hand 
    over the left. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Allaah burdens not a person beyond his scope”

    [al-Baqarah 2:286]
The Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to pray at night and when he got 
    tired he would sit, then when he was about to bow he would stand up so that 
    he could bow. 

    It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with 
    her) said: When I saw the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) reciting during night prayers sitting down, he would say takbeer 
    and recite sitting down, then when there were thirty or forty verses left, 
    he would stand up and recite them, then he would bow. Narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari, 1097; Muslim, 731. 

    It is narrated in al-Saheehayn that the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) prayed sitting for a few days 
    because he was sick. If it is permissible not to stand, which is one of the 
    pillars or essential parts of the prayer, because of sickness, then it is 
    more appropriate that it should be permissible not to do one of the Sunnahs 
    of prayer because of tiredness, on condition that one go back to holding the 
    right hand over the left when that tiredness is no longer present. 

    Al-Shaafa’i (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Umm 
    (1/100): 
If a person starts the 
    prayer standing then some excuse appears, he may sit, but if that excuse 
    then disappears, he is not allowed to do anything but stand. End quote. 

    Al-Nawawi said in Sharh Muslim, 6/11: 
‘Aa’ishah’s words, “[he 
    would] recite sitting down, then when there were thirty or forty verses 
    left, he would stand up and recite them, then he would bow” indicate that it 
    is permissible to sit during part of a rak’ah and to stand during part of 
    the same rak’ah. This is our view and is the view of Maalik, Abu Haneefah 
    and most of the scholars, whether one stands then sits, or sits then stands. 
    Some of the salaf disallowed it, but this is wrong. End quote. 

    To sum up our answer: 

    There is nothing wrong with letting the arms hang by the 
    sides during prayer because of tiredness, so long as one goes back to 
    holding the right hand over the left once the tiredness has gone. That is 
    not regarded as imitating the Raafidis, because it is done temporarily and 
    for a reason. It is only imitating them if the worshipper takes it as a 
    habit and lets his arms hang by his sides in every prayer, and never holds 
    the right hand over the left.
