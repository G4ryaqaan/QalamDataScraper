38521,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/38521,Loudspeakers should not be used outside the mosque for the prayer,"Is it better for us to use the indoor loudspeakers for taraaweeh and tahajjud prayers, or to use the outdoor loudspeakers so that people in the streets and neighbouring houses can hear?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Outdoor loudspeakers should not be used for the prayer, whether that is for taraaweeh, tahajjud or any other prayers such as Fajr, Maghrib and ‘Isha’, because that leads to many negative consequences and causes disturbance to the neighbours of the mosque.
 Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was asked: 
In recent times it has become very common for the imams of mosques to use outdoor loudspeakers, which are usually placed in the minaret and the volume is set very high. By doing this, some mosques disturb one another in the prayers in which Qur’aan is recited out loud, by using these loudspeakers for the recitation. What is the ruling on using loudspeakers for the prayers in which Qur’aan is recited out loud when the sound from the minaret will disturb other mosques? 
He replied: 
What you have mentioned about using loudspeakers on the minaret for the prayers in which Qur’aan is recited out loud is something that is not allowed, because it causes a lot of disturbance for the people in houses and other mosques nearby. Imam Maalik (may Allaah have mercy on him) narrated in al-Muwatta’ (178), from Sharh al-Zarqaani in Baab al-‘Aml fi’l-Qiraa’ah (How Qur’aan is to be recited) from al-Bayaadi Farwah ibn ‘Amr – may Allaah be pleased with him – that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) went out to the people when they were praying, and their voices were loud in recitation, and he said: “ A worshipper is conversing with his Lord, so let him think about the One with Whom he is conversing. Do not raise your voices above one another when reciting Qur’aan.” 
Abu Dawood (1332) narrated, under the heading, “Raising the voice when reciting Qur’aan in night prayers” that Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri – may Allaah be pleased with him – said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) observed i’tikaaf in the mosque and he heard them raising their voices in reciting Qur’aan. He drew back the curtain and said: “Each of you is conversing with his Lord, so do not disturb one another, and do not raise your voices above one another in reciting Qur’aan – or in prayer.” Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said: The hadeeths of al-Bayaadi and Abu Sa’eed are both sound and saheeh. 
These two hadeeths show that it is forbidden to raise one's voice in reciting Qur’aan in prayer to such an extent that it disturbs others, and that this is a nuisance and is forbidden. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in Majmoo’ al-Fataawa (23/61): No one has the right to raise his voice so much when reciting out loud that he disturbs others, such as other worshippers. 
In an answer he gave in al-Fataawa al-Kubra (1/350) he said: Whoever does anything that disturbs the people in the mosque, or does anything that will lead to that, should be stopped.  
With regard to the excuses offered by those who raise their voices, that may be answered in two ways: 
1 – The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade people to raise their voices above one another in reciting Qur’aan, and explained that this causes annoyance. It is well known that the believer has no option and cannot ignore the ruling of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“It is not for a believer, man or woman, when Allaah and His Messenger have decreed a matter that they should have any option in their decision. And whoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger, he has indeed strayed into a plain error”
[al-Ahzaab 33:36]
It is also well known that a believer should not put himself in a position where he causes disturbance or annoyance to his brothers. 
2 – The excuses that they give, even if they have some grounds, nevertheless are outweighed by the forbidden things that happen as a result of raising the voice, such as the following: 
(i)doing something that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade, namely worshippers raising their voices above one another
(ii)Annoying other worshippers who can hear one, as well as others such as people who are studying or trying to memorize Qur’aan
(iii)Distracting members of congregations in neighbouring mosques from listening to the recitation of their own imam, which they are commanded to listen to.
(iv)Some of the worshippers in neighbouring mosques may end up following the imam who is raising his voice in rukoo’ and sujood, especially if they are in a big mosque with a large congregation which they could be confused by the voice of an imam that drowns out the voice of their own imam. We have heard of many such incidents.
(v)It may lead to some people becoming negligent about hastening to attend the mosque, because they can hear the prayer of the imam rak’ah by rak’ah, step by step, so they dawdle, thinking that the imam is at the beginning of the prayer, until they miss most or all of the prayer.
(vi)It may cause the people who are coming to the mosque to rush when they heard the end of the imam’s recitation, as we see happening. Thus they do something that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade, i.e., rushing, because they hear this amplified voice.
(vii)There may be people in the houses who hear this recitation when they are engaged in some idle pursuits or idles talk, as if they are careless about the reciter. This is the opposite of what those who support raising the volume suggest, which is that many of the women in the houses will hear the recitation and benefit from it. This benefit may be achieved through listening to tapes with recordings of the recitation of skilled reciters.
With regard to the comment by those who support raising the volume that it may influence some people and make them come and pray, especially if the voice of the reciter is beautiful, this may be true, but it is a rare benefit that is outweighed by the harmful effects mentioned above. 
The basic principle on which there is consensus is that if there is a conflict between pros and cons, we must look and see which outweighs the other and judge accordingly. If they are equal, then warding off harm takes priority over bringing benefits. 
My advice to my Muslim brothers is to err on the side of caution and to be compassionate towards their Muslim brothers who are disturbed by their worship because of what they hear of these amplified voices that are so loud that the worshipper does not know what he is saying or what he should say in the prayer of du’aa’, dhikr and Qur’aan. 
I heard that a man was leading the prayers and was reciting the tashahhud, but nearby there was a mosque from which he could hear the recitation of the imam, and he started to repeat the tashahhud because he couldn’t hear himself think, so he made the prayer too long for himself and for the people behind him. 
Moreover, if they do this and stop amplifying the sound from the minarets, they will be showing compassion towards their brothers, in obedience to the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Do not raise your voices above one another in reciting Qur’aan,” and his words, “Do not disturb one another, do not raise your voices above one another in reciting Qur’aan.” There is no secret that the heart finds spiritual joy and contentment in obeying the commands of Allaah and His Messenger. 
He also said: 
There is no reason not to make an exception in the case of the Mosques in Makkah and Madeenah and the jaami’ mosques in which Friday prayers are held, because some of the worshippers may be outside the mosque and need to hear the voice of the imam. This is subject to the condition that the jaami’ mosques are not so close to one another that they would disturb one another. If that is the case then the loudspeakers on the walls of the mosques should be set up so that the khutbah and prayer can be heard, and the loudspeakers on the minarets should be turned off at that time, so that benefits may be achieved without disturbing others.

38532,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/38532,Can he break his fast during the day in Ramadaan because of a medical examination?,"I am going to have some diagnostic imaging done at the hospital, and this means that I cannot fast on that day. If I do not do this imaging now, I will not get another appointment for several months. Is it permissible for me to break my fast in order to do this imaging?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is permissible for one who is sick to break his fast, and he has to make up the days that he does not fast because of sickness, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number [of days which one did not observe Sawm (fasts) must be made up] from other days”
[al-Baqarah 2:185]
The kind of sickness which means that a person is allowed not to fast is severe sickness which causes hardship or harm to the person if he fasts, or which it is feared will make the sickness worse or delay recovery because of fasting. The scholars also said that this applies if it is feared that a person may become sick because of fasting. 
If your sickness falls into any of these categories (as appears to be the case), it is permissible for you not to fast, because diagnostic imaging helps to determine the sickness and thus prevent it getting worse or delaying recovery. 
But if your sickness does not fall into any of these categories, then it is not permissible for you to break your fast, and you should try to do the imaging at night if you can, or wait until Ramadaan is over. 
Shaykh Muhammad al-Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen said: 
The person who is sick with a temporary illness falls into one of three categories: 
1 – Those for whom fasting is not difficult and does not cause hardship. They have to fast and are not excused. 
2 – Those for whom fasting is difficult but does not cause harm. It is makrooh for them to fast because that means they are rejecting a concession granted to them by Allaah, as well as being hard on themselves.  
3 – Those for whom fasting is harmful. It is haraam for them to fast because that means they are bringing harm upon themselves. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And do not kill yourselves”
[al-Nisa’ 4:29] 
“and do not throw yourselves into destruction”
[al-Baqarah 2:195]
According to the hadeeth, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There should be neither harming nor reciprocating harm.” Narrated by Ibn Maajah and al-Haakim. Al-Nawawi said: it has isnaads which strengthen one another. Whether or not fasting is harmful for a sick person is known either from the person feeling that himself or a trustworthy doctor telling him of that. 
If a sick person breaks his fast, he has to make up the number of days that he missed when he recovers. If he dies before recovering, then that obligation no longer applies because the command is to make up the fasts from other days, but he did not live to see those other days.

38543,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/38543,Accidentally Eating after Fajr: Is the Fast Valid?,"At dawn on the first day of Ramadan my wife woke me up and said, “Do you want some water?” When I took the water from her, I asked her, “Has the adhan (call to prayer) come yet?” and she said, “No.” Approximately 15-20 minutes after I drank the water, the iqamah (call immediately before prayer) was given. If I drank the water about 5-10 minutes after the adhan, is there any sin on me? May Allah reward you with good.","There is strong evidence for the view that the one who eats or drinks after Fajr or sunrise by mistake, his fast is valid and he does not have to make it up. However, it is better for him to fast a day later.",,"Praise be to Allah.The scholars differed concerning the ruling on one who eats or drinks thinking that it is still night and that dawn has not yet come , and the one who eats or drinks thinking that the sun has set then he finds out that he was mistaken. 
Many of the scholars were of the view that this invalidates his fast, and he must fast another day to make up for it. 
Others were of the view that his fast is still valid and that he should complete his fast and does not have to make it up. This is the view of Mujahid and al-Hasan among the Tabi'in, it was narrated in one report from Imam Ahmad, and it was the view favoured by al-Muzani among the Shafi`is, and by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah. It was also the view regarded as correct by Shaykh Muhammad ibn al-Salih al-‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on them all). 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: 
“Those who say that the fast is not broken if a person makes a mistake or forgets at the beginning or end of the day said: our evidence is stronger, and the evidence of the Quran and Sunnah concerning what we say is clearer. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error” [al-Baqarah 2:286]
Forgetting and falling into error are mentioned together, because the one who does things that are forbidden in Hajj or prayer by mistake is like one who does them out of forgetfulness. It was proven in al-Sahih that one day at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) they broke the fast and then the sun appeared, but it does not say in the hadith that they were ordered to make up that fast. But Hisham ibn ‘Urwah said: It must be made up, but his father was more knowledgeable than him and he said, They do not have to make it up. And it was proven in al-Sahihayn that a group of Sahabah used to eat until one of them could distinguish the white thread from the black. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to one of them, “Your pillow is wide [if the white thread (of dawn) and the black thread (of the night) are underneath your pillow], rather that is the whiteness of the day and the blackness of the night.” But it is not narrated that he told them to make up their fasts; they were ignorant of the ruling so they were making a mistake. And it is proven that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab broke his fast then it became clear that it was still day, but he said, “We will not make it up because we did not deliberately commit sin.” And it was narrated that ‘Umar said: “We will make it up,” but the isnad of the first report is stronger. And it was narrated from him that he said, “It is not a serious matter.” So some of the scholars understood this as meaning that it is not essential to make it up, but the wording does not indicate that. 
In conclusion, this view is stronger in terms of reports and reasoning, and is more strongly supported by evidence from the Quran and Sunnah and analogy (qiyas).” (Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 20/572, 573) (See also al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 6/411.)
Hence we can see how strong the evidence is for the view that his fast is valid and he does not have to make it up. However, if the Muslim does that which is on the safe side and fasts a day in its stead, that will be better.

38552,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/38552,Chewing gum for a fasting person who suffers from a jaw disease,My father is sick and has pain in his jaw. The doctor advised him to chew gum in order to exercise the jaw. Will his fast be valid if he chews gum?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Chewing gum is not free of substances that dissolve when chewed and enter the stomach, so it is not permissible to use it during the day in Ramadaan when one is fasting. He could do without it and do exercises for the jaw instead, and chew gum after the sun sets and until dawn comes. 
If he can find a kind of gum that does not contain substances that dissolve when it is chewed, then it is permissible to use that because it will not break his fast, because nothing from it will enter the stomach. But your father should be advised not to chew it in front of people who do not know about his situation and his excuse, so that they will not accuse him of neglecting his religious commitment. If this kind of gum cannot be found or your father needs to chew the regular kind of gum during the day, and if not doing that will lead to a delay in his recovery or to his sickness becoming worse, then it is permissible for him to break his fast in Ramadaan, and he should make up the days that he misses, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):

38553,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/38553,Should she pray Taraaweeh or respond to her husband’s requests?,"Is it permissible to call one’s wife to come to bed or to make dinner or to do anything else when she is praying Taraaweeh and has not yet completed eleven rak’ahs? Is it permissible for her to pray part of Taraaweeh, then take care of her housework, and then go back and complete what is left of Taraaweeh prayer?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is permissible for a Muslim to pray Taraaweeh all together or to break it up. If someone wants to pray it at the beginning of the night or in the middle or at the end, without doing anything else in between, he can do that and there is nothing wrong with that. If someone wants to pray part of it at the beginning of the night and delay the rest until the end of the night, there is nothing wrong with that either. 
Based on this, it is permissible for a woman to pray Taraaweeh then to take a break between each two rak’ahs to attend to the needs of her husband or children, and that does not affect her prayer; indeed she will be rewarded both for her prayer and for serving her husband and looking after the house. 
The husband’s rights also come before Taraaweeh prayer, because his rights over his wife are obligatory whereas Taraaweeh is Sunnah, and what is obligatory takes precedence over what is Sunnah. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade women to observe naafil (supererogatory) fasts without their husbands’ permission. 
It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:  “It is not permissible for a woman to fast when her husband is present without his permission, or to allow anyone into his house except those for whom he gives permission, and whatever she spends of his money without being told to, half of the reward for that will go to him.”  
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4899; Muslim, 1026. 
The reason why this is forbidden is that if she fasts and neglects her husband’s right to intimacy because she is observing a naafil fast, it is not permissible to do something that is naafil and neglect something that is obligatory. 
Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said: 
This hadeeth indicates that the husband’s right is more binding on the woman than her observing a voluntary action, because his right is obligatory, and fulfilling an obligatory duty takes precedence over observing a voluntary action. 
Fath al-Baari, 9/296 
So the wife has to combine the two actions without either going to extremes or neglecting her duties. 
And the husband should not keep distracting his wife busy with insignificant matters that she could delay; he should help her to pray qiyaam, make du’aa’ and read Qur’aan. That will be good for him, for her and for their family.

Does burping break fast?","Praise be to Allah.What is burping?
Burping refers to when air comes out from the stomach, making a sound, through the mouth when one is full. 
Does burping break fast?
Simply burping does not break the fast, but if some food comes out with it , then it must be spat out. If it is swallowed deliberately, then this breaks the fast, but if it is swallowed involuntarily , without meaning to, or if one cannot spit it out, then the fast is still valid. 
Al-Ramli said in Nihayat al-Muhtaj, 1/171: 
“He ate and drank a lot at night and he knows from experience that when morning came he would burp and something would come out of his stomach as a result. Should he be told not to eat and drink so much, and if he goes against that and something comes out, does that break his fast or not?
This is subject to further discussion. The answer is that he should be told not to eat too much at night and when morning comes, if he burps and something comes out , but he spits it out and washes his mouth, that does not break his fast, even if that happens many times.”

38577,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/38577,The tenants do not pay him rent because they are poor – how can he pay zakaah?,"I have some properties that I rent out in Palestine, but the tenants are not paying me rent for the third year in a row, because they do not have enough work to help them buy their daily food, because of the tragic circumstances we are going through, such as curfews and closures. 

 I also have a house that is empty and is not rented out. Do I have to pay zakaah on these properties even though there is no fixed income from them? Or is it possible to delay paying zakaah until a time when circumstances improve and I am able to get the rent from the tenants?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.We ask Allaah to grant victory to our brothers in Palestine 
      and elsewhere over their enemies, and to grant them divine support and 
      make them strong in the land. 
Patience, O people of Palestine; patience, O weak and 
    oppressed; for the support of Allaah will undoubtedly come. “Victory comes 
    with patience.” Saheeh al-Jaami’, 6806 
No matter how long the night, day must inevitably come, and 
    the light of dawn must inevitably dispel the darkness of night. 
Secondly: 
No zakaah is due on real estate, whether it is land, houses 
    or shops, etc, unless it is for trading, in the sense that one buys it in 
    order to trade in it by selling it and making a profit. 
So no zakaah is due on property which the owner rents out, 
    rather zakaah is due on the rent if it reaches the nisaab and one full hijri 
    year has passed. 
This nisaab is the equivalent of 85 grams of gold or 595 
    grams of silver. 
See question no. 2795. 
If the rent that you are owed by the tenants reaches the 
    value of the nisaab in gold or silver, and one hijri year has passed from 
    the time when it reached the nisaab, then the scholars differ as to whether 
    zakaah is due on the debt owed by one who is in difficulty. There are 
    several opinions: 
1 – That zakaah is not due in this case.  
This is the view of Qataadah, Ishaaq, Abu Thawr and the 
    people of Iraq, and was narrated from Ahmad and Ibn Hazm, because the person 
    is not able to benefit from (the property). 
Al-Muhalla, question no. 696; 
    al-Insaaf, 3/18 
2 – That he should pay zakaah for the years that have passed 
    when he receives the rent.  
This is the view of al-Thawri, Abu ‘Ubayd and the correct 
    view of the Shaafa’i and Hanbali madhhabs. Among the evidence they quote for 
    that is the saheeh report from ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him) 
    concerning the debt that is not certain to be repaid. He said: “If he is 
    sincere, let him pay zakaah on it when he receives it, for whatever years 
    have passed.” Narrated by ‘Abd al-Razzaaq in al-Musannaf, 7116. 
And because it is 
    property that is under his control, so he must pay zakaah for the time that 
    has passed, like he pays zakaah for a debt that a rich man owes him.  
See al-Majmoo’ by al-Nawawi, 6/16; al-Mughni, 
    2/345; al-Insaaf by al-Mardaawi, 3/22 
3 – He should pay zakaah for one year when he gets it.  
This is the view of ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez, al-Hasan, 
    al-Layth and al-Awzaa’i, and is the view of Maalik as stated in 
    al-Muwatta’, 1/253, where he says: “With regard to debt the indisputable 
    view among us is that a person should not pay zakaah on it until he receives 
    it, even if it stayed with the debtor for several years, then he receives it 
    after that, he only has to pay zakaah on it for one year.”  
See al-Kaafi by Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr, 1/93 
This third view is the 
    one on which a fatwa from the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas (9/190) 
    is based, in which it says: 
If the debt is owed by someone who is not well off, then he 
    should pay zakaah for one year when he takes possession of it, even if more 
    than one year has passed. This was narrated from Imam Ahmad, and is the view 
    of Maalik. Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Hasan stated this in a fatwa and said: 
    This is the view favoured by Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab (may Allaah have 
    mercy on him). 
It was also regarded as more likely to be correct by Shaykh 
    Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, who said that he should not pay zakaah on it until he takes 
    possession of it, and that when he does take possession of it, he should pay 
    zakaah for one year only. He said: If that debt is owed by one who is in 
    difficulty, then the correct view is that zakaah is not required, because 
    the owner has no right to demand his money according to sharee’ah, because 
    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And if the debtor is in a hard time (has no money), then 
    grant him time till it is easy for him to repay; but if you remit it by way 
    of charity, that is better for you if you did but know”
[al-Baqarah 2:280]
He is indeed not in 
    control of that money, so he does not have to pay zakaah on it. But if he 
    takes possession of it, then he must pay zakaah for one year only, even if 
    it remains in the possession of the debtor for ten years, because this is 
    like paying zakaah on things that come out of the earth when one acquires 
    them. Some of the scholars said that he should not pay zakaah for what is in 
    the past, rather he should start counting the year from scratch. But what we 
    have mentioned above is more on the safe side and is more likely to 
    discharge one's duty; he should pay zakaah for one year and then pay zakaah 
    after another year passes with it still in his possession. This is easy; it 
    is not difficult for a person to pay one quarter of one-tenth of a debt that 
    has been paid back to him after he had given up on it. This is a way of 
    showing gratitude to Allaah for having gotten it. 
Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Rasaa’il Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 
    18/28 
In conclusion: no zakaah is due on these properties that you 
    have, either those that you are renting out or those that are empty. Rather 
    zakaah is due on the rent if it reaches the nisaab and one hijri year has 
    passed. If the rent that you are owed by these tenants reaches the nisaab, 
    then you should pay zakaah on it, when you receive it, for one year only, 
    even if a number of years has passed.

38579,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/38579,Does Your Fast Break If You Swallow Vomit?,"I am two months pregnant and I have been vomiting during the month of Ramadan. Sometimes the vomiting occurs shortly before Maghrib, and sometimes I feel that some of the vomit goes back into the stomach. What is the ruling on that?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
There is no dispute among the scholars concerning the fact that vomiting deliberately is one of the things that invalidate the fast, but if a person cannot help vomiting, that does not break his fast. This was mentioned by al-Khattaabi and Ibn al-Mundhir. See al-Mughni, 4/368. 
The evidence for that from the Sunnah is the report narrated by al-Tirmidhi (720) from Abu Hurayrah, that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever cannot help vomiting does not have to make up the fast, but whoever makes himself vomit deliberately, let him make it up.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in al-Fataawa (25/266): With regard to vomiting, whoever makes himself vomit deliberately has broken his fast, but if he cannot help vomiting, this does not break the fast. 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz was asked about the ruling on one who cannot help vomiting when he is fasting – does he have to make up that day or not? He replied: 
He does not have to make it up, but if he made himself vomit, then he has to make it up. And he quoted the hadeeth referred to above as evidence. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was asked in Fataawa al-Siyaam (p. 231) whether vomiting in Ramadan breaks the fast. He replied: 
If a person vomits deliberately, this breaks the fast, but if it was not deliberate then this does not break the fast. The evidence for that is the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), and he quoted the hadeeth referred to above. 
So if you cannot help vomiting, then you have not broken your fast. If a person feels that his stomach is churning and what is in it is going to come out, then do we tell him that he has to prevent it, or to make it happen? No, but we do say: take a neutral stance. Do not try to make it happen and do not try to prevent it, because if you make yourself vomit you will have broken your fast, but if you try to prevent it you will harm yourself. So leave it, and if it comes out without any action on your part, then it will not harm you and you will not have broken your fast. 
Secondly: 
If some of the vomit goes back into the stomach without any deliberate action on a person’s part, then his fast is valid, because this did not happen by his choice. The Standing Committee was asked (10/254) about a fasting person who vomited then swallowed his vomit without meaning to – what is the ruling in this case? 
They replied: 
If he vomited deliberately then his fast is invalidated, but if he could not help it then his fast is not invalidated. Similarly it is not invalidated by his swallowing it so long as he did not do that deliberately.",Islam Q&A
38592,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/38592,Ruling on doing tawaaf during the Friday khutbah,Is it permissible to do the farewell tawaaf in the Haram whilst the imam is delivering the Friday khutbah?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.The scholars differed concerning the ruling on doing tawaaf during the Friday khutbah, whether that is an obligatory tawaaf such as tawaaf al-ifaadah, the farewell tawaaf and the tawaaf of ‘umrah, or it is mustahabb. 
The Maalikis are of the view that it is not allowed, by analogy with prayer, because the one who is praying behind the imam is not allowed to pray during the Friday khutbah, except for tahiyyat al-masjid (“greeting the mosque”, two rak’ahs performed upon entering the mosque). That is because it involves ignoring the khateeb and his khutbah, and tawaaf is like prayer in this regard. 
See Mawaahib al-Jaleel (3/78). 
The Shaafa’is are of the view that it is permissible to do tawaaf during the Friday khutbah, and they rejected the analogy with prayer, because tawaaf does not prevent one from listening to the khutbah, unlike prayer which is a greater distraction. 
See al-Ghurar al-Bahiyyah (2/29) and al-Fataawa al-Fiqhiyyah al-Kubra (1/239). 
Shaykh Ibn Jibreen was of the view that tawaaf during the Friday khutbah is not allowed. He was asked: What is the ruling on residents and travellers doing tawaaf when the khateeb is delivering the khutbah on Friday? 
He replied: Once the khateeb begins his khutbah, the worshippers must listen attentively to the khutbah and stay where they are, and it is not permissible to busy oneself with something other than that, except for one who comes in during the khutbah, who may pray two rak’ahs but he should make them short, whether he is one of the people of Makkah or not. The evidence that it is forbidden to move and speak during the khutbah is general in meaning, to such an extent that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If you say to your companion, ‘Listen attentively’ when the imam is delivering the khutbah, then you have engaged in idle speech.” Thus he warned against asking someone to be quiet even though it is done for the right reason. Based on this, we think that it is not permissible to do tawaaf at all so long as the imam is delivering the Friday khutbah. The imams of old forbade doing tawaaf during the khutbah, but the later imams were more lenient and claimed that they could not prevent those people who were doing tawaaf and those who gave the reason that they were travelling and were bidding farewell to the Ka’bah in this tawaaf, or who think that tawaaf is superior to listening attentively to the khutbah. But this is not correct, and we think that they should be prevented until the Friday prayer is over. With regard to the Eid khutbah, there is nothing wrong with doing tawaaf during this khutbah, because it is sunnah, and the worshippers are not obliged to stay until it ends.

38594,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/38594,"He has a problem with forgetfulness, lack of focus and not being organized","I think that I have some personal problems. For example, I forget things quickly, I am not focused, I am lazy and careless, I am not organized in my work, may character is weak and I am unable to say no to other people. This sometimes causes me a lot of distress and regret, and other problems that I do not want to mention. This is despite the fact that Allaah has bestowed some blessings upon me, and I enjoy some positive things in life, such as success in my professional and family life, praise be to Allaah. Sometimes they say that I am intelligent and educated, and even a genius, and I think that there is some truth in these words, but the problems is that these personal problems that I mentioned bother me a great deal. I hope you can advise me on how to solve these problems, and that you will also pray for me.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
You should praise Allaah for the blessings that He has bestowed upon you, namely Islam and true guidance, good health, the ability to hear, see and speak, and other innumerable blessings, including the positive things and success in your professional and family life that you mention. You should utter words of praise and thanksgiving to Allaah, for how many people are deprived of these blessings or many of them? 
If a person is content with that which Allaah has decreed for him, and is aware of the blessing of Allaah in the things that He has given him, he will enjoy peace of mind and his fear and grief will disappear. This will usually bring a solution to many of the things that are bothering him, such as lack of focus, shyness and so on. 
Secondly: 
Rest assured that these things that you mention can be dealt with, improved and changed, but this depends on whether you really want that and do the things that will help you to achieve that. One of the greatest means of doing that is asking Allaah to improve your attitude and to grant you maturity, and to protect you from the evil of your own self, and so on. So strive to recite a lot of the du’aa’s of that type narrated from the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
Another means of improving your memory and reducing forgetfulness is to keep your mind busy and make it get used to memorizing verses from the Book of Allaah. The more a person memorizes, the easier it becomes for him and the more enthusiastic he will become, and more able to achieve that. 
Another means is to stop looking, listening, speaking, eating and sleeping too much, so that your heart will be prepared to memorize that which is beneficial, for too many distractions make the mind unfocused. 
What is meant by doing too much of these things is that for which there is no need and in which there is no benefit. 
Another means is to avoid haraam things, especially in food and drink, and looking. Concerning this al-Shaafa’i (may Allaah have mercy on him) wrote his famous lines of verse: 
“I complained to Wakee’ about my bad memory, and he advised me to give up sin.
He said, ‘Know that knowledge is light, and the light of Allaah is not to be entrusted to a sinner.’” 
Thirdly: 
There is nothing wrong with you reading some books about organization which will help you learn the methods of being organized, making decisions, and controlling your feelings of anxiety and shyness, and interacting with people in general. 
We ask Allaah to give you strength and success in this world and in the Hereafter.",Islam Q&A
