2601,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2601,"Destroying a place
    of evil without anyone knowing","They are building a nightclub in my
      community and we have tried to no avail to stop this. This will bring great immorality and
      corruption to our community, both to Muslims and non-Muslims. According to the shari'ah,
      is it allowed to destroy this place if no one is caught and the owner will lose all the
      money he invested in it. Is this an acceptable form of reducing evil as commanded in the
      Quran?",,,"Praise be to Allah.We put this question to our shaykh, Shaykh Abd al-Rahmaan
    al-Barraak, who answered as follows:
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): Let there arise out
    of you a group inviting to all that is good, enjoining al-Maruf (Islamic monotheism
    and all that Islam orders one to do), and forbidding al-munkar (polytheism and all that
    Islam has forbidden) [Aal Imraan 3:104]. 
The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
    Whoever of you sees an evil action, let him change it with his hand [by taking
    action against it], and if he cannot, then with his tongue [by speaking out against it],
    and if he cannot, then with his heart [by feeling that it is wrong], and this is the
    weakest of faith. (Reported by Muslim, no. 70).
    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): So
    keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you can [al-Taghaabun 64:16].
With regard to the evil thing that you mention in the question, you should
    try to change it or get rid of it as much as you can, so that you eliminate it or at least
    reduce it. This can be done by taking the matter to the people in authority who have the
    power to eliminate it or move it to another area, or by talking to the owner of the site
    and asking him to stop investing in evil which will only cause harm to him in this world
    and the next, and to invest in something that will be of benefit to him and the people
    living in the neighbourhood, without causing them any harm in either their spiritual or
    worldly affairs. 
As for taking action by destroying the nightclub, as mentioned in the
    question, this is not permitted, even if the one who does this is sure he will not get
    caught. The evil resulting from such an action is too great, such as the destruction of
    property which is it not permissible to destroy, and the accusation and torture of
    innocent people that is bound to happen during the investigation of the incident.
    Moreover, the owners of the nightclub may not give up, and are most likely to try again to
    build the place. Beware, my zealous brother, of being too hasty to change evil things
    without thinking about the consequences. It is a good job that you asked this question so
    that matters might become clear to you, which they surely are now. And Allaah is the Guide
    to the Straight Path.",Islam Q&A - Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
2602,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2602,Shaving the hairs    on the testicles and around the anus,"I have a question about shaving hairs below navel. I don't know how far down to go. Should the hairs from the testicles be also removed. Please shed some light on this.
And what about women are they also suppose to shave their hairs?",,,"Praise be to Allah.We put this question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-Uthaymeen, may Allaah preserve him, who answered as follows:
In the Name of Allaah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful. Praise be to Allaah, the Lord of the Worlds. This is not part of the Sunan al-Fitrah, but if there are too many hairs then they should be removed, so that they do not get contaminated with any impurity when using the toilet.
There are reports in the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) which indicate that the pubic hairs should be removed, as it was reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The fitrah consists of five things, one of which is removing the pubic hairs. (Reported by al-Bukhaari).
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) also set a time limit of forty days, and the hair should not be left any longer than that,because of the hadeeth of Anas ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him), who said: He set us a time limit of no more than forty days for trimming the moustache, clipping the nails, plucking the armpit hairs and shaving the pubic hair. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 10/284 and Muslim, 1/222).
The fuqaha discussed the proper etiquette of removing the pubic hair and said that it is mustahabb to start shaving the pubic hair from beneath the navel, and to start on the right hand side, and one should also be concealed from the sight of others when doing this. One should also bury any hair or nail clippings removed.
The reasons behind removing this dirty hair could also be applied to the hair on the testicles and around the anus, if impurity (najaasah) gets attached to it, because the purpose it to be comepletly clean and pure and keep away from anything that may cause dirt and impurities to cling to the body. In this case, removing this hair is a good thing. With the regard to women, the rulings on removing the pubic hair are the same as the rulings for men. And Allaah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
2606,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2606,"The meaning of    thinking about going for jihaad, and combining da’wah and jihaad","Assalaau Alaykum,
My dear respected Shaikh,
I am an undergraduate student studiying in the field of  Computer Engineering in University of XXXXX . InshaAllah I will be graduating next year. Alhamdulillah I am married and expecting a kid very soon ! InshaAllah. Alhamdulillah I make efforts to gain knowledge and implement it upon the way of Salaf-us-Salih and I know this is the right way . But there is one thing I do not reallyunderstand : that is the issue of Jihaad. InshaAllah please do clarify this for me in the following context:
1. My obligation with regards to Jihaad
2. The meaning of the Hadith : Whoever dies and did not fight in battle, nor did he have the sincere wish to fight in battle, dies on a branch of hypocrisy. [Muslim]
3. How do I prepare for Jihaad.
4. How should I weigh the affair between gaining knowledge, Da'waf and Jihaad.
I would also like to know what the major Ulama say with regards to this.
Jazakallahu Khairan.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Imaam Muslim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his Saheeh: Chapter: Condemnation of the one who dies without having gone out for jihaad or having thought of doing so. Then he quoted the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him), who said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Whoever dies without having gone out for jihaad or having thought of doing so, dies on a branch of hypocrisy.
(Saheeh Muslim, 3533).
Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: What is meant is that the one who does this is behaving, in this regard, like the hypocrites who stay behind and do not go out for jihaad, because not engaging in jihaad is one of the branches of hypocrisy. This hadeeth also indicates that the one who intended to do an act of worship but died before he could do it is not to be condemned to the same extent as one who died without any such intention.
Al-Sindi said, in his footnotes to Sunan al-Nisaa'i: without having thought of [it] means without having said to himself, I wish I could go out for jihaad. Or it could mean that he did not intend to go out for jihaad, and the sign of intending to go out for jihaad is preparing equipment. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): And if they had intended to march out, certainly they would have made some preparation for it [al-Tawbah 9:64].
A person can prepare himself for jihaad in many ways, such as:
Learning the virtues of jihaad and the rulings concerning it;
preparing oneself with different kinds of acts of worship;
training oneself to make sacrifices;
forcing oneself to prefer others to oneself;
spending for the sake of Allaah;
studying and reading the biographies of mujaahideen and heroes of Islam;
studying Islamic battles;
constantly telling oneself that if jihaad is established and one has the means and is able to go for jihaad, there is no choice but to enlist;
knowing how sinful it is to run away from the battlefield or flee before the kuffaar;
studying the Seerah (biography) of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) during both the Makkan and Madani periods, and studying his battles and campaigns, to see how he conducted the jihaad in the context of his own circumstances, what he started with and how he prepared himself;
understanding that jihaad has to go through stages, beginning with the nearest enemy, until one reaches the stage of being able to fight all the mushrikeen;
being aware of the movements of hypocrisy;
waging jihaad on four fronts against ones own nafs or base self, against the Shaytaan, against the kuffaar and against the hypocrites;
understanding the importance of waging jihaad with ones wealth as well as with ones self.
Know, my brother, that it is not difficult to combine jihaad with dawah, because each of them has its own time and place. When the mujaahideen were waging their conquests, they used to call people to Allaah before the battle started. When they conquered a country, they would call its people to Islam and teach them the religion. When there was no battle or jihaad going on, the doors of dawah were still wide open, and they would make dawah to their wives, children, relatives, neighbours and all people, Muslim and non-Muslim, calling them with wisdom and beautiful preaching, and arguing with them in a way that is better. May Allaah help us and you to do that which He loves and which pleases Him. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
2607,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2607,Wants to embrace Islam but fears eating pork without knowing,"As-salaa-mu 'alai-kum
  I would like to convert to Islam but I have my reservations on food,
      especially pork. I am still staying with my Chinese parents whereby pork is a very regular
      dish. If I were to convert and still stay at home, I am afraid that I may take pork cooked
      with say chicken without my knowledge.
     During family get-together dinners/functions, try as I can, I having been
      trying to avoid the pork dish and I can just ask for God's forgiveness when I cannot avoid
      it. If I were to convert and later have to consume pork, can I still ask for God's
      forgiveness?
  I am really very disturbed with this issue and appreciate your advice.
     Thank you.",,,"Praise be to Allah.There is no blessing in this world like embracing Islam, and there is no
    misfortune, sin or tribulation in this world like staying in kufr (disbelief). The created
    being must enter the religion of the Creator, and not wish for any other religion except
    Islam. The Creator knows the situation of His creatures and understands their inabilities,
    weaknesses, forgetfulness and mistakes, and so He forgives us for mistakes that are made
    unintentionally. Allaah does not ask anyone to do anything that is beyond his abilities,
    as he says (interpretation of the meaning): Allaah burdens not a person beyond
    his scope [al-Baqarah 2:286]. The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him) said: Allaah will forgive my ummah for their mistakes, and for
    what they forget, and for what they are forced to do. (Reported by Ibn
    Maajah, 2033; see also Saheeh al-Jaami, 1731).
    What you have mentioned in your question  that you
    may eat something haraam without realizing  is not something for which you will be
    punished. As long as you are going to do your best to avoid what Allaah has prohibited
     which is what you have indicated in your question  then there is no sin on
    you. Even if a person does commit a haraam deed, Islam still offers a way out from every
    sin, in the form of repentance, remorse, determination not to repeat the sin, and seeking
    forgiveness from Allaah. This guarantees that the sin will be erased. So go ahead with
    determination, and do not hesitate. Allaah will be with you and will not let you down so
    long as you are following the religion with which He is pleased. May Allaah help you and
    keep you on the Straight Path. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad..",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

2621,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2621,How to deal with a misbehaving mother,"first i wish to state that this q&a is very beneficial to the ummah mash'Allah and we hope you and your helpers will receive the best reward in this world and the next.  my question is on behalf of a muslim young man. he is mash'Allah a sincere seeming and knowledgeable muslim who follows islam to the best of his ability and upon the correct aqeedah. he lives alone with his divorced mother whose does not follow islam thoroughly and engages in very unislamic activities sometimes. i know both him and his mother and they are very close and very kind but i see that the son i sometimes put in situations that are extremely stressful for him and i cannot advise him properly. a few examples of these situations include the mother going out of the house in shorts and the son hating this shame but walking with her for fear that she will be accosted, or the mother being overly freindly with male acquaintances in the western manner, or going to dinner and sitting at a table where alcohol is being consumed though the mother does not consume it. there are various other types of scenarios that try this brother such as his mothers' friends advocating every kind of bidah. he does say what is wrong and try to give dawah to his mother but it is usually ignored as ""extremism"" or ""from the stone age"". please advise, my freind is confided in me only that he feels like a dirty ""dayouth"" and wants to know if staying with his mother is the correct thing given such behavior on her part. he errs on the side of staying with his mother even when she is adamant about wearing unislamic clothing for fear of her being molested be some stranger. also he did not tell me of these things and reveal his families faults, rather it is evident for those arouind to see as well as for me to see as his friend. please help and mat Allah ta'Aalaa reward you with the good.",,,"Praise be to Allah.There is no doubt that the story you have told us is very sad and moving, especially when we see someone suffering because  the person who is closest to him is lacking in terms of religion.  But ‘Allah (Alone) is Sufficient for us, and He is the Best Disposer of affairs for us.’ [Aal- ‘Imraan 3:173 – interpretation of the meaning] ‘Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return.’ [al-Baqarah 2:156 – interpretation of the meaning].
 This brother should remember that honouring one’s parents is one of the most important duties that human beings have towards one another, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And We have enjoined on man (to be dutiful and good) to his parents. His mother bore him in weakness and hardship upon weakness and hardship, and his weaning is in two years – give thanks to Me and to your parents, - unto Me is the final destination.  But if they (both) strive with you to make you join in worship with Me others of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not, but behave with them in the world kindly…” [Luqmaan 31:14-15].  These mushrik parents were doing their utmost to make their son associate partners with Allah, yet in spite of that Allah commanded the son to maintain a relationship with them and behave kindly with them in this world.  So you are also obliged to treat your mother well, advise her to give up her bad behaviour, explain to her how sinful her deeds are and what punishment awaits her if she does not stop.  If she responds, then praise be to Allah. If she does not, then keep away from her in a good way; do not mix with her in ways that will adversely affect your religion, but do not upset her either.  Behave with her in the world kindly, and continue to advise her from time to time.  Your keeping away from her will not be a sin, if you do it for the sake of Allah and in opposition to something wrong. 
(See the response of Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen in Fatawaa Islamiyyah, 4/196; al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah fi Fatawaa Islamiyyah (Standing Committee on Islamic Fatwas), 4/204; Shaykh ‘Abd-Allah ibn Jibreen in Fatawaa al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah, 2/957) 
In conclusion therefore, if your staying with her will benefit her by increasing her religious commitment and eemaan, her adherence to Islamic duties and her avoidance of haraam deeds – or at least reduce her involvement in such activities – because she feels that she is being watched, for example, or because this will keep bad people away from her, and this will not cause you any harm at the same time, then stay with her in the hope of earning reward for whatever efforts you make, and Allah will reward you for your patience.  If you have already tried your utmost, to no avail, and have found that you are not making progress in any of the ways referred to above, and staying with her will have an adverse effect on your own religious commitment or reputation, then there is no sin on you if you keep away from her, as stated above, so long as you continue to check on her from time to time, to pay attention to her needs and to advise her. We ask Allah to bless you with patience and reward you for your efforts, for He is the best of supporters and helpers.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

    of 2, 4, 6 or 8 rakahs, prayed after the sun has risen and before the time for Zuhr

    follows:
From Zayd ibn Arqam who said: The Messenger of Allaah 
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) went out to the people of Qubaa and
    found them praying. He said: Salaat al-Awwaabeen is when the young camels lift up

    1238).
According to a report narrated by Imaam Ahmad from Zayd ibn Arqam, the
    Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came to or entered the mosque at
    Qubaa after the sun had risen, and found the people there praying. He said:
    Salaat al-Duhaa should be prayed when the young camels lift up their feet (because
    of the heat of the sand).
According to a report narrated by Muslim from al-Qaasim al-Shaybaani, Zayd

Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The phrase
    Salaat al-Awwaabeen is when the young camels lift up their feet (because of the heat
    of the sand) refers to when the sand becomes unbearably hot from the suns
    heat, and burns the soles of the young camels feet, so they alternately raise and
    lower their feet in response to the heat of the sand. Al-Awwaab means
    one who is obedient, or one who turns to obedience. The hadeeth also refers to the best

Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And those who
    invoke not any other god along with Allaah, not kill such life as Allaah has forbidden,
    except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse – and whoever does this
    shall receive the punishment. The torment shall be doubled to him on the Day of
    Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace; except those who repent and believe,
    and do righteous deeds, for those, Allaah will change their sins into good deeds, and
    Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. And whosoever repents and does righteous good
    deeds, then verily, he repents towards Allaah with sincere repentance.” [al-Furqaan
    25:68-71]
It is not permitted for a man guilty of zinaa to marry a woman who is
    similarly guilty unless both of them repent sincerely to Allaah, may be He be glorified,
    so that they will no longer be described as being guilty of zinaa. Allaah says
    (interpretation of the meaning): “Let no man guilty of adultery or fornication
    marry any but a woman similarly guilty, or an unbeliever: not let any but a such a man or
    an unbeliever marry such a woman: to the Believers, such a thing is forbidden.”
    [al-Noor 24:3]
So you must repent sincerely to Allaah, and follow this kabeerah
    (major sin) with many good deeds, so that Allaah may forgive you. If you are both sincere

So I came back, and he asked me, What did you say? I repeated the story I had told him about my husband. He said: Stay in your house for the specified length of time. So I spent my `iddah there, four months and ten days. At the time of ‘Uthman, he sent word to me asking about this, so I told him, and he followed what I said and judged in accordance with it. Muhammad ibn Bashshar told us that Yahya ibn Sa’id informed us that Sa’d ibn Ishaq ibn Ka'b ibn ‘Ujrah informed us of something similar. Reported by al-Tirmidhi, who said: This is a sahih hasan hadith. The majority of scholars among the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and others followed this hadith and did not allow a widow to move out of her husband’s home until her `iddah was over. (Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 1125)
How should a widow observe her `iddah?
On the basis of the texts quoted above, the scholars have defined the rules governing widows and described how the widow's mourning should affect her life. These rules may be summed up as follows:

It is forbidden for the recently-widowed woman to use perfume, whether on her body or on her clothes
It is forbidden for the recently-widowed woman to adorn herself with things like henna or facial make-up, or to use kohl unnecessarily, or to use anything else that may make her beautiful and attractive to others.
It is forbidden for the recently-widowed woman to wear attractive clothes, such as clothes dyed with safflower or saffron, or other types of red dyes and colours that are used for adornment.
It is forbidden for the recently-widowed woman to wear jewellery.
It is forbidden for the recently-widowed woman to spend the night outside her own home , meaning the home of her deceased husband, except for some Islamically legitimate reason, such as her being afraid for her own safety, or being evicted by the landlord of rented premises, etc. If a recently-widowed woman needs to go out for medical treatment, to attend legal proceedings in court, to take exams in school , or to go shopping when she has no-one who can do this for her, then she should do these things during the day, so long as she comes back home to her husband’s house before Maghrib (sunset).
She is forbidden to marry or draw up a marriage contract; even engagement is forbidden, unless it is merely hinted at and not stated clearly.

From the above, it is clear that Islam gives the husband immense rights. The wife should give up wearing adornments and perfume, and should stay in her husband’s home during this period because of those rights. These rules also pay attention to her psychological state at this time when she has lost her support. 
Even though these rules are so clear, many people have still fallen prey to many different kinds of bid`ah when it comes to mourning, so they forbid a woman to do things that are not forbidden in Islam, and they fabricate lies and introduce bid`ah into the Religion of Allah. 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-’Aziz ibn Baz said:
“Some people may think and imagine that a recently widowed woman should not speak to anyone, or speak to anyone on the telephone, or have a bath more than once a week, or walk barefoot in her house, or go outside in the moonlight, or other such nonsense which has no basis. But in fact she is allowed to walk barefoot or with shoes in her house, to do whatever she needs to in her house, to cook food for herself and her guests, to walk in the moonlight on the roof or in the garden of her house, to take a bath whenever she wants, to speak to whomever she wants so long as it is decent talk, to shake hands with other women and with her mahram relatives (close relatives such as father, brother, etc.) but not with non-mahrams, and to remove her head covering so long as there are no non-mahrams present. She should not use henna, saffron or perfume, and she is not allowed to get engaged. A hint is permissible but not a clear statement. And Allah is the source of strength.” (Fatawa Islamiyah, 3/316)
Ruling on wearing black in mourning for the dead
Shaykh ‘Abd-Allah ibn Jibrin said: 
“Wearing black to mourn the deceased is a form of bid`ah , and the wives of the deceased only need to avoid fancy clothes, adornment, jewellery, makeup and perfume during the mourning period. Neglecting regular work during the mourning period is also a form of bid`ah. The recently widowed woman should still take care of cooking, cleaning, washing dishes, laundry, etc., and there is no sin involved in doing so. And Allah knows best. (Al-Lulu al-Makin, 39)
Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-Uthaymin said:
“Wearing special clothes to accept condolences is a form of bid`ah, in our opinion, because it could indicate that one is discontent with the decree of Allah, may He be glorified. (Fatawaa al-Ta’ziyah, 38)
He also said:
“Wearing black as a sign of mourning is a false symbol that has no basis. At times of bereavement a person should do what is taught by Islam, which is to say: Inaa Lillahi wa innaa ilayhi raji’un. Allahumma’jurni fi musibati wakhluf li khayran minha (To Allah we belong and unto Him is our return. O Allah, recompense me for my affliction and replace it for me with something better). As regards wearing some special clothing, such as wearing black and so on, this has no basis, and it is false and reprehensible conduct.” (Fatawa Islamiyah, 3/313)

    to test His slaves by means of various kinds of trials in order to demonstrate their
    patience and virtue, and to raise their status, to increase their reward for their
    steadfastness, and to test their sincerity in following the truth. Allaah says
    (interpretation of the meaning): And surely, We shall try you till We test those
    who strive hard (for the Cause of Allaah) and the patient ones, and We shall test your
    facts (i.e., the one who is a liar, and the one who is truthful). [Muhammad 47:31].
    Among the different types of test are the various means which the mushrikeen may employ to
    try to make a believer give up his faith, so they may apply psychological pressure to
    annoy him and make him go back to kufr. Allaah, may He be glorified, has mentioned this in
    His Book and has pointed out how we should respond. He tells us (interpretation of the
    meaning): You shall certainly be tried and tested in your wealth and properties
    and in your personal selves, and you shall certainly hear much that will grieve you from
    those who received the Scripture before you (Jews and Christians) and from those who
    ascribe partners to Allaah, but if you persevere patiently, and become al-muttaqoon
    (pious), then verily, that will be a determining factor in all affairs, and that is from
    the great matters, [which you must hold on to with all your efforts] [Aal
    Imraan 3:186]. 
If what is being said or done by others is causing too much
    psychological pain, then how much worse must it be when it is done by the closest of
    people, one with whom you share ties of flesh and blood, the mother who gave birth to you?
The hurt caused by those who are related to you is more bitter
    and painful/ to the soul than the blow of a sword. [poetry]
But when the believer is exposed to the most painful attacks from the
    closest of people to him, he does not give in or retreat; he follows the Quraan in
    his dealings with the mother who is hurting him or cutting him off and turning away from
    him. This is illustrated in the following story:
Musab ibn Sad ibn Abi Waqqaas reported from his
    father the mother of Sad swore that she would not speak to him, or eat or
    drink, until he renounced his religion (Islam) and became a kaafir. She said, You
    claim that Allaah tells you to honour and respect your parents. I am your mother and I am
    telling you to do this. She stayed like that for three days, until she fell
    unconscious from exhaustion. One of her sons, whose name was Umaarah, got up and
    gave her water to drink, and she began to pray against Sad. Then Allaah revealed the
    following aayah of the Quraan (interpretation of the meaning): And We have
    enjoined on man (to be dutiful and good) to his parents But if they (both) strive
    with you to make you join in worship with Me other of which you have no knowledge, the
    obey them not, but behave with them in the world kindly [Luqmaan 31:14, 15].
    (Reported by Muslim, 4432).
    The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
    him) also suffered rejection at the hands of some of those who were most closely related
    to him, such as his paternal uncle Abu Lahab, but this did not stop him from spreading the
    message and conveying the religion, despite the harshness of the opposition. Rabeeah
    ibn Abbaad al-Dayli, who later became Muslim, said: I saw the Messenger of
    Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with my own eyes in the
    marketplace of Dhool-Majaaz, saying, O people, say Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah
    and you will prosper. He was going through the alleyways of the market, and the
    people were gathering around him. I did not see anyone saying anything, and he did not
    stop saying, O people, say Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah and you will prosper.
    Behind him there was a man with a squint and a handsome face, and his hair in two braids,
    saying, He is a Sabian and a liar. I asked, Who is this? They
    said, Muhammad ibn Abd-Allaah, who is saying that he is a Prophet. I
    asked, Who is this who is denouncing him? They said, His paternal uncle

This ruling does not differentiate between men and women.,"Can you do ghusl without washing hair?


Does a woman have to undo her braid when doing ghusl?","Praise be to Allah.Can you do ghusl without washing hair?
Washing the hair when doing ghusl (full ablution) after having intercourse is obligatory. The evidence for that is the hadith narrated by ‘Aishah who said: When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did ghusl after having intercourse, he would start by washing his hands, then he would pour water with his right hand onto his left hand and wash his private parts, then he would do wudu as for prayer, then he would take the water and put his fingers in his hair till he reached the roots, and when he saw that the water had reached the roots, he would pour water over his head three times. Then he poured water over the rest of his body, then he washed his feet. (Muslim, 474) 
Shaykh Ibn Uthaymin said in his commentary on Bulugh al-Maram (p. 399): 
“This also indicates that it is obligatory to make the water reach the roots of the hair when doing ghusl after intercourse, and if the hair is thick , one does this by putting one's fingers in one's hair and pouring water over one's head three times after the water has reached the roots of the hair.
Does a woman have to undo her braid when doing ghusl?
This ruling does not differentiate between men and women , but the scholars did discuss undoing the hair if it is braided, in the case of women who do ghusl after intercourse and after finishing their period. 
The most correct view is that it is not obligatory to undo braided hair . The evidence for this is the hadith of Umm Salamah, who said: I said, O Messenger of Allah, I am a woman who braids her hair, should I undo it to do ghusl after having intercourse? (According to another report, she said: and after my period?) He said, No. It is enough for you to pour water on your head three times. ( Muslim)
Further evidence is to be seen in the hadith of ‘Ubayd ibn ‘Umayr, who said: ‘Aishah heard that ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar was commanding women to undo their braids when they did ghusl. She said, “This is very strange on the part of Ibn ‘Umar! He is telling women to undo their braids when they do ghusl. Why doesn’t he tell them to shave their heads?!” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and I used to do ghusl using one vessel, and I never did more than pour water on my head three times. (Muslim, 331)
Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-Uthaymin said in his commentary on Bulugh al-Maram (p. 406):
“This hadith speaks about women doing ghusl: do they have to undo these braids and wash what is underneath them or not? The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained that it is not obligatory to undo them every time, because this is too difficult, especially in the case of ghusl after intercourse. There is a difference of scholarly opinion on the matter. Some scholars said that it is obligatory for women to undo their braids when doing ghusl after their periods, but not when doing ghusl after having intercourse. The difference between the two is obviously that ghusl after intercourse is done frequently, and it would be too difficult for a woman to undo her braids in the morning and put them back in the evening or vice versa, but ghusl following one’s period is usually done only once a month, so it is easy for a woman to undo her braids for this purpose.”

2662,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2662,Prescribed means of warding off sihr (witchcraft) before it happens,What are the prescribed means of warding off sihr before it happens?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Among the most important means of warding off the danger of sihr before it happens is seeking protection through the adhkaar (dhikr) prescribed in Islam, making du`a and reciting prayers seeking refuge that were narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). These include: 
1 – Reciting Aayat al-Kursiy [al-Baqarah 2:255] after every prescribed prayer, after reciting the adhkaar which are prescribed after the salaam. 
2 – Reciting Aayat al-Kursiy when going to sleep. This is the greatest aayah in the Qur’aan, in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allah! Laa ilaaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), Al-Hayyul-Qayyum (the Ever Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists). Neither slumber nor sleep overtakes Him. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Who is he that can intercede with Him except with His Permission? He knows what happens to them (His creatures) in this world, and what will happen to them in the Hereafter. And they will never compass anything of His Knowledge except that which He wills. His Kursiy extends over the heavens and the earth, and He feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them. And He is the Most High, the Most Great”
[al-Baqarah 2:255]
3 – Reciting “Qul huwa Allahu ahad”, “Qul a’oodhu bi Rabb il-Falaq” and “Qul a’oodhu bi Rabb il-Naas” [i.e., the last three soorahs of the Qur’aan] following every prescribed prayer, and reciting these three soorahs (three times) at the beginning of the day after Fajr prayer, and at the beginning of the night after Maghrib prayer. 
4 – Reciting the last two aayahs of Soorat al-Baqarah at the beginning of the night. These are the aayahs in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The Messenger (Muhammad) believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers. Each one believes in Allah, His Angels, His Books, and His Messengers. (They say,) ‘We make no distinction between one another of His Messengers’ — and they say, ‘We hear, and we obey. (We seek) Your forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the return (of all).’
Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope. He gets reward for that (good) which he has earned, and he is punished for that (evil) which he has earned. ‘Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error, our Lord! Lay not on us a burden like that which You did lay on those before us (Jews and Christians); our Lord! Put not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear. Pardon us and grant us forgiveness. Have mercy on us. You are our Mawlaa (Patron, Supporter and Protector) and give us victory over the disbelieving people”
[al-Baqarah 2:285-285]
And it was narrated in a saheeh report that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever recites Aayat al-Kursiy at night will have ongoing protection from Allah and no devil will come near him until morning comes.” And it was also narrated in a saheeh report that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever recites the last two aayahs of Soorat al-Baqarah at night, that will suffice him.” The meaning – and Allah knows best – is that that will be sufficient protection for him against all evil. 
5 – Seeking refuge in the perfect words of Allah from the evil of that which He has created, night and day and when stopping to rest anywhere, be it in the city, in the desert, in the air or on the sea. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever stops to rest and says, ‘A’oodhu bi kalimaat Allah il-taammah min sharri ma khalaq  (I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allah from the evil of that which He has created),’ nothing will harm him until he moves on from that place.” 
6 – The Muslim should say at the beginning of the day and the beginning of the night (three times): “Bismillaah alladhi laa yadurr ma’a ismihi shay’un fi’l-ardi wa laa fi’l-samaa’i wa huwa al-samee’ al-‘aleem (In the name of Allah with Whose name nothing on earth or in heaven can cause harm, and He is the All-Hearing, All-Knowing).” According to saheeh reports, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) urged us to recite this, and this is a means of keeping safe from all evil. 
These adhkaar and prayers for refuge are among the greatest means of warding off the evil of sihr (witchcraft) and other evils, for the one who recites them regularly with sincerity and faith, putting his trust in Allah and depending upon Him, and being content with that. 
They are also some of the most effective weapons for warding off sihr after it has happened, along with humbly beseeching Allah constantly and asking Him to remove the harm and relieve the distress. Among the du`a’s which have been narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to treat diseases such as sihr and other things is the ruqyah by means of which he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to treat his companions: “Allahumma Rabb al-naas, adhhib il-ba’s, washfi anta al-Shaafi laa shifaa’a illa shifaa’uka shifaa’an laa yughaadir saqaman (O Allah, Lord of mankind, remove the harm and heal him, for You are the Healer and there is no healing except Your healing, with a healing which does not leave any disease behind).” There is also the ruqyah by means of which Jibreel treated the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Bismillah urqeeka min kulli shay’in yu’dheeka, wa min sharri kulli nafsin aw ‘aynin haasid Allah yashfeek, bismillaah urqeek (In the name of Allah I perform ruqyah for you, from every thing that is harming you, from the evil of every soul or envious eye may Allah heal you, in the name of Allah I perform ruqyah for you).” This should be repeated three times.

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Treat women kindly, for woman was created from a bent rib, and the most crooked part of the rib is the top part, so treat women kindly.” 
This is a command to husbands, fathers, brothers and others to treat women kindly and not to oppress them; to give them their rights and to guide them to do good. This is what is obligatory upon everyone, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Treat women kindly.” This is not altered by the fact that a woman may sometimes mistreat her husband or relatives with her words or actions, because she was created from a rib as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, and the most crooked part of it is the top. It is well known that the top of it is the part by which it is attached, so the rib will have some crookedness in it at that point, as is well known. 
The meaning is that she will inevitably have some crookedness or shortcomings in her character. Hence it was narrated in another hadith in al-Saheehayn: 
“I have not seen any lacking in rational ability and failing in religion but (at the same time) robbing the wisdom of the wise, besides you [women].” 
The point is that this is the ruling of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and it is narrated in al-Saheehayn from the hadith of Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him). What is meant by lacking in rational ability, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, is that the testimony of two women is equivalent to the testimony of one man. Failing in religion, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, means that women spend days and nights without praying, i.e., because of menstruation or post-childbirth bleeding.  This is a shortcoming which Allah has decreed for them, and there is no sin on them because of that. 
So women should accept this in the way that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) meant it, even if a woman is knowledgeable and pious, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not speak of his own whims and desires, rather that was a Revelation that was revealed to him, which he conveyed to the ummah, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“By the star when it goes down (or vanishes).
Your companion (Muhammad) has neither gone astray nor has erred.
Nor does he speak of (his own) desire.
It is only a Revelation revealed” [al-Najm 53:1-4]","Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat al-Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez  ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him), part 5"

          – the sharing of household expenses between a husband and wife who both 
          go out to work and earn a living – and avoid any dispute concerning 
          it.
 
          With regard to how that should be done, this depends 
          on a number of things, as discussed below:
 
          1 – If your husband stipulated in the marriage contract 
          that expenses are to be shared otherwise he will not let you work, then 
          the Muslims are bound by their conditions, as the Prophet SAWS (peace

          conditions which forbid something that is permitted or permit something 
          that is forbidden.” And he SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon

          “The conditions which are most deserving of fulfilment 
          are those by means of which sexual intimacy becomes permissible for 
          you.”  
 
          So you are bound by the conditions you made, if you made 
          any conditions [in your marriage contract].
 
          2 – If you did not make any conditions, then the household 
          expenses are all the responsibility of the husband, and the wife does 
          not have to pay any of the household expenses; he is the one who has 
          to pay them. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Let the rich man spend 
          according to his means”
[al-Talaaq 65:7]
 
          And the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
          upon him) said: “You are obliged to spend on them and clothe them according 
          to what is reasonable.”
 
          So spending is the obligation of the husband. He is the 
          one who should take care of the household needs and his own needs and 
          those of his wife and children. (The wife’s) money and salary belong 
          to her, because that is given in return for her work and her efforts. 
          (The husband) draw up the marriage contract on that basis, and he did 
          not stipulate any condition that she should pay the household expenses, 
          or half of them, etc. – unless she gives up any part of her salary of 
          her own good pleasure,  
“but if they, of their 
          own good pleasure, remit any part of it to you, take it, and enjoy it 
          without fear of any harm (as Allaah has made it lawful)”
[al-Nisaa’ 4:4]
 
          But if the marriage contract was drawn up on the basis 
          of any such condition, then the Muslims are bound by their conditions.
 
          But we advise you to give up part of your salary to your 
          husband in order to please him and to resolve the dispute and solve 
          the problem, so that you may live in peace and harmony. So agree upon 
          something between yourselves, such as one half of the salary, or one-third, 
          or one-quarter, etc., so that the problem will be solved and so that 
          love and harmony may take the place of conflict. Or perhaps he will 
          agree and be content with what Allaah has decreed for him, and he will 
          spend according to his means, and he will forego all of your salary 
          and have some pride concerning the matter. But if that is not possible, 
          then there is no reason why you should not refer the matter to the courts 
          in the city where you live, and whatever the shar’i court decides will 
          be sufficient, in sha Allah. May Allaah help you both.",From the fatwas of Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez

The correct attitude in this case is to ask what is meant by the word “mu’min” (believer). If the speaker is referring to the essence of faith, i.e., Islam, without which one would be a kaafir, then in this case it is not correct to say “in sha Allah.” This would imply some doubt about Islam, which is not permitted; the Muslim should be definite in his faith, and should say “I am a mu’min,” without adding “in sha Allah.” However, if what is meant is the perfection of faith and the high rank which is above the level of just being a Muslim, then one should say “in sha Allah,” because otherwise one would be praising oneself, which is forbidden as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Therefore ascribe not purity to yourselves” [al-Najm 53:32]
If a person wants to say something straightforward to express his belief, then he should say “I am a Muslim.” In this case there is no need to add “in sha Allah.”

2690,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2690,Issues on Islamic ‘Aqidah,"Hello, my name is XXXX and I was taking a look at your web page. I am interested in it because I am in a Religious Studies class and I am interested in learning more. I just wanted to know your response to this,
if I am correct in saying this...
In Islam heaven is thought of as paradise of wine, women and song. It is achieved by living a life in which, ironically, one abstains from the things with which he or she will be rewarded in paradise. In addition to this abstention, one must follow the five Pillars of Islam.
It seems to me that the Islamic faith is a do-it-yourself proposition.
Follow this ""way of life"", they say, and you will gain favor with God and eventually achieve salvation. There is NO assurance. I would hate to live like that. I realize that Muslims do not believe in ""original sin"", but regardless of whether or not a man is born sinful or not, would you not agree that every man/woman is sinful? How does one pay for his/her sin?
I understand repentance. I agree with that...but it seems as though one can NEVER do enough to win favor with God. That is why He sent his Son to die for us. All of our sins past, present and future.
There is no possibility of assurance in the Islamic faith. I think that would be an awful way to live knowing that I was never gonna make it...not knowing of my salvation until the ""day of judgement"" whether or not I have done enough ""goodworks"" or prayed enough...etc.
I have asked a couple of Muslims in my class whether or not they were for sure if they were going to ""paradise"" or ""heaven"" when they died. I have not yet had one reply in the affirmative. Rather, they referred to the imperfection of their lives as being a barrier to this realization. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE IN ISLAM, BECAUSE THERE IS NO ATONEMENT, AND SALVATION DEPENDS WHOLLY ON THE INDIVIDUAL'S GAINING   ENOUGH ""MERIT""
Also, if I wanted to become a Muslim, I couldn't. If Muslims think that they are the ""chosen people"" then why aren't they spreading their faith.
Do you just have to be lucky enough to be born Muslim? If a person wants to become a Christian they can. ANYONE can become a Christian in a matter of seconds. All they have to do is confess that Jesus Christ is who He said He was and repent and believe...that is all a lot easier said than done. But basically that is it. I wasn't born Christian...or raised Christians assert that Jesus Christ is the only way to God because
Scripture says, ""Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved. (Acts 4:12) Jesus Christ said himself
""I am the way the truth and the life, NO ONE comes to the Father except through me...""
He didn't say, I am one way or a way or one truth etc....THE WAY!!!
I and the Father are ONE! Jn 5:18
I just don't understand how anyone could be blind to these facts. Unless they are never told. Which was me.
I would just like a little feedback","According to the Islamic ‘aqidah:

Does the statement ‘I and the Father are one’ prove Jesus’ divinity?","Praise be to Allah.We appreciate your question concerning the ideas that you have about Islam, and we hope to discuss what you have written and correct some of your ideas, so as to arrive at a firm conviction of the truth of the matter.
Are the pleasures of Paradise merely physical?
What you have mentioned about the Islamic belief about Paradise, and the enjoyment of wine , women and song therein, falls wide of the mark. The pleasures of Paradise are not merely physical in nature, they also include the joy of feeling safe and secure, and of being content with God and being close to Him. 
The greatest joy of all in Paradise will be seeing God , may He be glorified and exalted. When the people of Paradise see the Holy Face of God, they will forget all other kinds of pleasures that they have enjoyed. There is in Paradise everything that will delight the heart and eye; no dirty or evil talk is heard there, nor sinful speech. 
No person knows what is kept hidden for them of joy as a reward for what they used to do. [al-Sajdah 32:17 interpretation of the meaning]. 
What I am trying to say is that the delights of Paradise are not limited to the kind you refer to in your question. They are far greater than that.
Will the entrance to Paradise only be granted to those who heed certain prohibitions?
You mention the idea that entrance to Paradise will only be granted to those who heed certain prohibitions, which they will enjoy in Paradise in the Hereafter as a reward for avoiding it in this life. 
This generalization is not correct at all. Islam is a religion which commands action, not just abstinence. Salvation can only be attained through fulfilling commands, not just by avoiding things that are forbidden. 
Moreover, not every luxury in Paradise will consist of something that was forbidden in this world and is now being given as a reward. Some of the delights of Paradise will be things that were allowed in this world, such as marriage, good fruits like pomegranate and figs, etc., drinks like milk and honey, and so on. All of these are permitted in this world, and will be delights to be enjoyed in Paradise. 
The bad qualities of things that are forbidden in this world will not be present in their heavenly forms. For example, the wine of Paradise, as Allah tells us, causes neither ghoul (any kind of hurt, abdominal pain, headache, sin, etc.) nor intoxication (see al-Saffat 37:47). It does not rob a person of his mental faculties, or cause headaches and stomachaches. It is quite different from its earthly counterpart. 
The point I am making is that the delights of Paradise do not consist only of allowing things that were forbidden in this world. It is also worth pointing out that there are cases where abstention from prohibited things will not be rewarded by being given their equivalent in the Hereafter, whether those prohibited things are food, drinks, deeds or words. Poison, for example, will not be given as a luxury in Paradise, although it is forbidden in this world.
The same applies to sodomy, incest and other things which will not be allowed in the Hereafter although they are forbidden in this world. This matter is quite clear, praise be to Allah.
Does every person have a guarantee of Paradise?
The idea of being guaranteed Paradise, and that a person’s life will be as horrible and unbearable as you describe if he has no such guarantee, is a misconception which itself leads to the results you mention. 
If you were to say that every person has a guarantee of Paradise , this would be utterly disastrous, because then everyone would commit all kinds of forbidden acts, feeling safe because of this guarantee. 
Many of the crimes committed by Jews and Christians have been done on the basis of this guarantee, with documents of forgiveness from their priests. Allah has told us about such people (interpretation of the meaning):
“And they say, None shall enter Paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian. Say, Produce your proof if you are truthful.” [Al-Baqarah 2:111]
For us Muslims, Paradise is not the matter of our own desires or the desires of anyone else, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“It will not be in accordance with your desires (Muslims), nor those of the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians); whoever works evil will have the recompense thereof, and he will not find any protector or helper besides Allah.” [Al-Nisa 4:123]
Islamic view regarding a guarantee of one’s destiny
There follows a brief summary of the Islamic view regarding a guarantee of one’s destiny.

Islam offers a guarantee to every sincere Muslim who obeys Allah and remains in this state of devotion until he dies, that he will definitely enter Paradise. Allah says in the Quran (interpretation of the meanings):

“But those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, We shall admit them to the Gardens under which rivers flow (i.e., in Paradise), to dwell therein forever. Allah's promise is the truth, and whose words can be truer than those of Allah? (Of course, none).” [Al-Nisa 4:122]
“Allah has promised those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, that for them there is forgiveness and a great reward (i.e., Paradise).” [Al-Maidah 5:9]
“(They will enter) ‘Adn (Eden) Paradise (everlasting Gardens), which the Most Beneficent (Allah) has promised to His servants in the unseen: verily, His promise must come to pass.” [Maryam 19:61]
“Say: Is that (torment) better, or the Paradise of Eternity promised to the muttaqin (pious and righteous persons)? It will be theirs as a reward and final destination.” [Al-Furqan 25:15]
“But those who fear Allah and keep their duty to their Lord (Allah), for them are built lofty rooms, one above another, under which rivers flow (i.e., Paradise). (This is) the Promise of Allah, and Allah does not fail in (His) promise.” [Al-Zumar 39:20]

Islam also guarantees the disbeliever who ignores the commands of Allah that he will definitely enter Hell. Allah says (interpretation of the meanings):

“Allah has promised the hypocrites, men and women, and the disbelievers, the Fire of Hell, therein shall they abide. It will suffice them. Allah has cursed them and for them is the lasting torment.” [Al-Tawbah 9:68]
“But those who disbelieve, for them will be the Fire of Hell. Neither will it have a complete killing effect on them so that they die, nor shall its torment be lightened for them. Thus do We requite every disbeliever!” [Fatir 35:36]
Allah will say to the disbelievers on the Day of Judgement (interpretation of the meaning):
“This is Hell which you were promised! Burn therein this Day, for that you used to disbelieve!” [Ya-Sin 36:63-64]
Allah will not go back on His promise to either the believers or the disbelievers. He describes how both of them will be at the end of the Day of Judgement (interpretation of the meaning):
“And the dwellers of Paradise will call out to the dwellers of the Fire (saying): We have indeed found true what our Lord had promised us; have you also found true, what your Lord promised (warnings, etc.)? They shall say, Yes. Then a crier will proclaim between them: The Curse of Allah is on the zalimin (polytheists and wrongdoers, etc.).” [Al-A’raf 7:44]
Everyone who believes and does righteous deeds, and dies in this state, will definitely enter Paradise. Everyone who disbelieves and does evil deeds, and dies in this state, will definitely enter Hell.
One of the great guiding principles of Islam is that the believer should tread a path between fear and hope. He should not take it for granted that he will enter Paradise, because this will make him complacent, and he does not know in what state he will die. Nor should he assume that he is going to Hell, because this is despairing of the mercy of Allah, which is forbidden.
So the believer does righteous deeds, and hopes that Allah will reward him for them, and he avoids evil deeds out of fear of the punishment of Allah. If he commits a sin, he repents in order to gain forgiveness and protect himself from the punishment of Hell. 
Allah forgives all sins and accepts the repentance of those who repent. If a believer fears that the good deeds he has sent on before him are not enough, as you suggest, then he will increase his efforts, in fear and hope. 
No matter how many righteous deeds he has sent on before him, he cannot rely on them and take them for granted, or else he will be doomed. He keeps striving and hoping for reward, and at the same time he fears lest his deeds be contaminated with any element of showing off, self-admiration, or anything that will lead to them being rejected by Allah. Allah describes the believers (interpretation of the meaning):
“Those who give that (their charity) which they give (and also do other good deeds) with their hearts full of fear (whether their alms and charity, etc.) have been accepted or not), because they are sure to return to their Lord (for reckoning).” [Al-Muminun 23:60]
So the believer keeps on striving, fearing and hoping, until he meets his Lord, believing in Tawhid (Divine Unity) and doing righteous deeds, and earns the pleasure of his Lord and Paradise. If you think about the matter, you will realize that these are the right motives for action, and that righteousness cannot be achieved in this life in any other way.
Islamic view on original sin
As regards what you say about original sin, this matter needs to be approached from several angles.

Firstly: The Islamic belief concerning human sin is: the individual bears the responsibility for his own sin ; no one else should bear this burden for him, nor should he bear the burden for anyone else. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And no bearer of burdens shall bear another’s burden.” [Fatir 35:18] 

This refutes the idea of original sin. If the father commits a sin, what fault is that of his children and grandchildren? Why should they bear the burden of a sin that someone else committed?
The Christian belief that the descendants should bear the sin of their father is the essence of injustice. How can any sane person say that the sin should be carried down the centuries by all of humanity, or that the children, grandchildren and subsequent descendants should be tainted because of their father’s sin?

Secondly, making mistakes is a part of human nature. Our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Every son of Adam is bound to commit sins.” (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 2423), but Allah has not left man unable to do anything about the mistakes that he makes. He gives man the opportunity to repent, and so the hadith (words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) quoted above concludes: and the best of those who commit sins are those who repent. The mercy of Allah is clear in the teachings of Islam, as Allah calls His servants (interpretation of the meaning): “Say, O My servants who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allah, verily Allah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [Al-Zumar 39:53]

This is human nature, and this is the solution to the problem of sin. But to make this human nature, which is bound to make mistakes, a barrier between the servant and his Lord which will prevent him from ever earning the pleasure of God, and to say that the only way to reach God is through His sending His (so-called) son down to earth to be humiliated and crucified while his father looks on, so that mankind could be forgiven, is an extremely odd idea. Just describing it sounds so unlikely that there is no longer any need to refute it in detail. 
Once, when discussing this issue with a Christian, I said, If you say that God sent down His son to be crucified to atone for the sins of the people alive at his time and afterwards, what about those who had come before and died as sinners before the time of Christ, and had no opportunity to know about him and believe in the Crucifixion so that their sins might be forgiven? All he could say was: No doubt our priests have an answer to that! Even if they do have an answer, it is bound to be concocted. There is no real answer.
If you really examine the Christian teaching on human sin with an open mind, you will see that they say that God sacrificed His only son to atone for the sins of mankind, and that this son was a god. If it was true that he was a god who was beaten, insulted and crucified, and died, then this doctrine contains elements of blasphemy because it accuses God of weakness and helplessness. Is God really incapable of forgiving the sins of all His servants with just one word? If He is Able to do all things (and the Christians do not dispute this fact), then why would He need to sacrifice His son in order to achieve the same thing? (Glorified and exalted be He far above what the wrongdoers say about Him!)
“He is the Originator of the heavens and the earth. How can He have children when He has no wife? He created all things and He is the All-Knower of everything.” [Al-An’am 6:101 interpretation of the meaning]
An ordinary man would not accept anyone harming his child; he would come to his defence, and would never hand him over to an enemy who would insult him, let alone leave him to face the worst kind of death. If this is the attitude of a mere created being, what then of the Creator?

Thirdly, the Christian doctrine of original sin has a negative effect because, as you have mentioned, it does not require any duties of man other than to believe that God sent His son to this earth to be crucified and to die to atone for the sins of mankind. 

Thus a person becomes a Christian and is to earn the pleasure of God and be admitted to heaven. Moreover, the Christian believes that everything that happened to the son of God was only to atone for his sins, past present and future, so there is no need to wonder why Christian societies have seen such an increase in murder, rape, robbery, alcoholism and other problems. After all, did not Christ die to atone for their sins, and haven’t their sins been wiped out, so why should they stop doing these things?
Tell me, by your Lord, why do you sometimes execute murderers, or put criminals in jail, or punish them in other ways, if you believe that the criminals' sins have all been atoned for and forgiven through the blood of Christ? Is this not a strange contradiction?
Why do Muslims make da`wah?
You ask why, if the Muslims are the chosen people of mankind, they do not spread their religion . The fact of the matter is that sincere Muslims have always sought to do just that. How else could Islam have spread from Makkah to Indonesia, Siberia, North Africa, Bosnia, South Africa and all parts of the world, East and West? 
The faults in the behavior of some modern Muslims cannot be blamed on Islam; those faults are the result of going against Islamic teachings. It is not fair to blame the religion for the faults of some of its adherents who have gone against it or gone astray. 
Are Muslims not being more just than Christians when they affirm that the sinner is threatened with the punishment of Allah unless he repents, and that for some sins there is a deterrent, a punishment to be carried out in this world as an expiation for the Hereafter, as in the case of the punishments for murder, theft, fornication/adultery, etc.?
Is it difficult to become a Muslim?
What you say about it being so easy to become a Christian, as compared to becoming a Muslim, is clearly mistaken. The key to Islam is no more than two simple phrases: Ash-hadu an la ilaha ill-Allah wa anna Muhammadan Rasul-Allah (I bear witness that there is no god except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah). 
With these few words, a person enters Islam in a matter of seconds. There is no need for baptism or priests, or even to go to a certain place such as a mosque or anywhere else. 
Compare this with the ridiculous procedures of baptism which the Christians do when they want to admit someone to the Church. Then there is the fact that the Christians venerate the cross on which Jesus was tortured and crucified in great pain as they claim. They take it as a sacred object of blessing and healing, instead of scorning it and hating it as a symbol of oppression and the worst possible way for the son of God to die!
Muslims are closer than others to the truth
Do you not see that the Muslims are closer than others to the truth, because they believe in all the prophets and messengers, respecting them all and recognizing that all of them taught the truth of Divine Unity (Tawhid) and that each of them was appointed by Allah and sent to his people with laws that were appropriate to the time and place? 
When the fair-minded Christian sees the followers of Islam believing in Musa (Moses), ‘Isa (Jesus), and Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon them all) and in the original Torah and Gospel, as well as the Quran, and sees his own people denying the Prophethood of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and rejecting the Quran, wouldn’t his open-mindedness make him think that the Muslims are most likely to be right?
Did Jesus say ‘No one comes to the Father except through me’?
You say that the Messiah said, No one comes to the Father except through me. We need, first of all, to be sure that these words can truly be attributed to Jesus. Secondly, this is clearly not true. How then could mankind have known God at the times of Nuh (Noah), Hud, Salih, Yunus (Jonah), Shu’ayb (Jethro), Ibrahim (Abraham), Musa (Moses) and other prophets? 
If you were to say that during the time of Jesus (upon whom be peace) and up to the time of the Final Prophet, Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) the Children of Israel had no other way to know the religion of Allah except through the way of Jesus, this would be correct.
Does the statement ‘I and the Father are one’ prove Jesus’ divinity?
You quote the Messiah as saying, I and the Father are one . This is clearly not correct. If we examine the matter objectively, without letting our own desires get in the way, it becomes clear that the conjunction and in the phrase I and the Father implies that two separate entities are involved. I is one entity, and the Father is another. If you say, So-and-So and I, it is obvious to any rational person that they are two separate people. The equation 1+1+1=1 makes no sense to any rational person, whether he is a mathematician or not.
Finally, I advise you (and I do not think that you will reject this advice) to think deeply about what you have read, putting aside your background, any preconceived ideas, your own desires and feelings of attachment to your religion or culture, and to seek guidance sincerely from Allah. Allah is Most Generous and will never let any of His servants down. Allah is the One Who guides to the Straight Path, and He is Sufficient for us and is the best disposer of affairs.

Should the people be stopped by the Committee from praying in these parks?

If he spreads out a thick and taahir (pure) mat, then his prayer will be valid. 
But it is not permissible for Muslims to pray in parks – even on thick and pure mats – rather they have to pray with their Muslim brothers in the houses of Allaah – the mosques – of which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“In houses (mosques) which Allaah has ordered to be raised (to be cleaned, and to be honoured), in them His Name is remembered [i.e. Adhaan, Iqaamah, Salaah (prayers), invocations, recitation of the Qur’aan]. Therein glorify Him (Allaah) in the mornings and in the afternoons or the evenings,
Men whom neither trade nor sale (business) diverts from the remembrance of Allâh (with heart and tongue) nor from performing As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as-Salaah) nor from giving the Zakaah. They fear a Day when hearts and eyes will be overturned (out of the horror of the torment of the Day of Resurrection).
That Allaah may reward them according to the best of their deeds, and add even more for them out of His Grace. And Allaah provides without measure to whom He wills”
[al-Noor 24:36-38]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever hears the call (to prayer) and does not come, then his prayer does not count, unless he has a (valid) excuse.” (Narrated by Ibn Maajah, al-Daraaqutni, Ibn Hibbaan and al-Haakim. Its isnaad is (saheeh) according to the conditions of Muslim). 
A blind man asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “O Messenger of Allaah, I have no guide to bring me to the mosque. May I have a dispensation to pray in my house?” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to him, “Can you hear the call to prayer?” He said, “Yes.” He said, “Then respond.” (Narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh). 
And there are many ahaadeeth which say the same thing. 
What the Committee for Enjoining what is Good and Forbidding what is Evil should do is to disallow people to pray in parks, and tell them to pray in the mosques, in accordance with the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Help you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety)”[al-Maa’idah 5:2]
 and 
“The believers, men and women, are Awliyaa’ (helpers, supporters, friends, protectors) of one another; they enjoin (on the people) Al-Ma‘roof (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do), and forbid (people) from Al-Munkar (i.e. polytheism and disbelief of all kinds, and all that Islam has forbidden)” [al-Tawbah 9:71]
And in accordance with the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Whoever among you sees an evil action, let him change it with his hand (by taking actions); if he cannot then with his tongue (by speaking out against it); and if he cannot then with his heart (by feeling that it is evil) – and that is the weakest of faith.” (Narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh).","Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat al-Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez  ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him), part 5"
