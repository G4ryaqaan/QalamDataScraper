67728,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/67728,She is not sure whether she cut her hair properly in order to exit from ihraam for Hajj. What should she do?,"I am an elderly woman, and last year I performed the obligatory Hajj, praise be to Allaah. After doing tawaaf al-ifaadah, I asked one of the sisters to cut my hair for me so that I could exit ihraam, but after we came back to our own country, I began to doubt whether this lady had cut my hair in the required manner or not. I am asking you for advice so that I can put my mind at rest as to whether my Hajj is valid.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The scholars have stated that if a person does an act of 
    worship and finishes it, then is uncertain as to whether he has completed it 
    or not, and this doubt does not reach the level of certainty, then no 
    attention should be paid to it and the act of worship is valid and complete, 
    in sha Allaah. 

    This applies especially in the case of one who experiences a 
    lot of doubts concerning acts of worship. It is not permissible for such a 
    person to pay attention to his doubts, for they are tricks of the shaytaan. 

    Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni (3/187): 
If a person has doubts 
    about his tahaarah (purity) whilst he is doing tawaaf, that tawaaf is not 
    valid, because he had doubts about a condition of worship before he had 
    finished it. The same applies if he has doubts about his tahaarah whilst 
    praying. 

    But if the doubts come after he has finished the act of 
    worship, then he does not have to do anything, because a doubt about an act 
    of worship after it has been completed does not have any effect on it. End 
    quote. 

    Al-Zarkashi said in al-Manthoor fi’l-Qawaa’id al-Fiqhiyyah 
    (2/257): 
Imam al-Shaafa’i 
    differentiated between doubts during an action and doubts after an action. 
    In the second case he did not say that it must be repeated, because that 
    would cause hardship. If a worshipper were required to remember what he had 
    done in prayer, that would be too difficult for him and no one would be able 
    to do that, so there is some leniency in the matter. End quote. 

    The Standing Committee was asked the following question:  

    Should any attention be paid to doubts about the number of 
    rak’ahs, or the number of circuits of tawaaf or saa’i, after the action has 
    been completed? Is that also the case with regard to wudoo’ or not? i.e., 
    should no attention be paid to doubts that come after the act of worship has 
    been completed? 

    They replied: 

    No attention should be paid to doubts that come after 
    completing tawaaf, saa’i and prayer, because it seems that the act of 
    worship is sound. End quote. 

    Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 
    7/143 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was asked about a person who 
    experienced a great deal of doubt concerning his prayer: what is your 
    advice? 

    He replied: 

    No attention should be paid to many doubts, because that will 
    lead to waswaas (whispers from the shaytaan). The shaytaan will not stop at 
    raising doubts concerning that, rather he will make him doubt other things, 
    until he even makes him have doubts concerning Tawheed and the attributes of 
    Allaah, may He be exalted, or he may make him wonder whether his wife is 
    divorced from him or is still his wife. This poses a threat to a man’s 
    sanity and his religious commitment. 

    Hence the scholars said that no attention should be paid to 
    doubts in three cases: 

    1 – When it is simply imagination with no basis in reality. 
    This should be ignored completely and no attention paid to it at all.

    2 – When there are many doubts and a person has doubts every 
    time he does wudoo’, or every time he prays, or every time he does 
    something. This should also be ignored completely and no attention paid to 
    it at all. 

    3 – If the doubt comes after completing an act of worship. No 
    attention should be paid to it so long as one is not certain of the matter. 
For example: if a person 
    is uncertain, after saying the salaam at the end of the prayer, whether he 
    prayed three or four rak’ahs of a four-rak'ah prayer, he should not pay any 
    attention to this doubt because he has completed the prayer. But if he is 
    certain that he did not pray more than three rak’ahs, he should do the 
    fourth rak’ah if he has just recently completed the prayer, then do the 
    prostration of forgetfulness after saying the tasleem. If some time has 
    passed, then he should do the whole prayer over again. End quote.

1 – If you sell these things to one who you know will use them for haraam display, then it is not permissible. 
2 – If you sell them to one who you know will use them for halal means of adornment, then it is permissible. 
3 – If you do not know anything about the buyer, then it is permissible to sell to her. 
The Standing Committee was asked: 
What is the ruling on dealing in women’s fashions and selling them to one whom the seller knows will wear them in front of non-mahram men in the street, as he can tell from the way she appears in front of him, and as is the situation in many places? 
They replied: 
It is not permissible to sell these things if the merchant knows that the one who is buying it is going to use it for things that Allah has forbidden, because that is a kind of cooperating in sin and transgression. But if he knows that the purchaser is going to use them to adorn herself for her husband, or he does not know anything, then it is permissible for him to sell them. End quote.

67777,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/67777,She did an operation during Ramadaan and bled for several days,"During Ramadaan I had an operation on my reproductive organs which had nothing to do with a miscarriage or giving birth, and I bled for several days after the operation. The doctor told me that I could fast, so I fasted. What is the ruling on my fast?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
The blood that comes out of a woman may be menstruation or nifaas (postpartum bleeding), in which case her fasting is not valid, according to scholarly consensus, because of the report narrated by al-Bukhaari (1951) from Abu Sa’eed (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Is it not the case that when she menstruates, she does not pray or fast?” 
Or it may be neither menstruation nor nifaas, such as the blood that comes out because of a haemorrhage in the uterus or because of surgery, etc. This does not mean that a woman cannot pray and fast, rather the woman is taahirah (pure) and may do what women who are pure do, except that she should do wudoo’ for each prayer after the time for it begins. 
See also question no. 39494 
Hence when the woman who was suffering from istihaadah (non-menstrual vaginal bleeding) asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “O Messenger of Allaah, I do not become pure, should I stop praying?” the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “That is just a vein and is not menstruation. When the usual time of menstruation comes, stop praying, and when it is over, wash the blood from yourself and pray.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 306; Muslim, 333. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about a woman who had an operation. After the operation and four or five days before her period, she saw dark blood that was not menstrual blood. Then immediately after that her period came and lasted for seven days. Are the days when she bled before her period counted as part of it? 
He replied: 
She should refer to doctors concerning this, because it seems that the blood which this woman saw was the result of that operation. Blood that comes because of surgery does not come under the same rulings as menstrual bleeding, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said concerning the woman who suffered from istihaadah, “That is blood from a vein.” This indicates that if the blood that comes out is from a vein – which includes bleeding because of surgery – then it is not regarded as menstrual blood, so it does not make haraam the things that are made haraam by menses. So she must still pray and fast, if that is during the day in Ramadaan. End quote.

67787,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/67787,Ruling on working in Bank al-Bilaad,"What is the ruling on working in Bank al-Bilaad which is going to be established shortly? I know from a source in the Saudi Arabian Financial Institution that all the transactions of this bank will be Islamic, but it will not be called an Islamic bank.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    The Financial Institution is to be commended for its keenness 
    to establish a bank whose operations are run in accordance with shar’i 
    rulings. We ask Allaah to help them to do that which He loves and is pleased 
    with. 

    Secondly: 

    If the operations of the bank are run in accordance with 
    Islamic guidelines, there is nothing wrong with working there, even if it is 
    not called an Islamic Bank. But if its operations are based on riba in 
    lending and borrowing, or other haraam things, then it is not permissible to 
    work there even if it is called an Islamic bank. What matters is what really 
    happens, not mere names.  

    The sharee’ah council of the bank has issued a statement 
    which suggests that the Bank al-Bilaad will submit to a shar’i policy which 
    requires it to show all its operations to the sharee’ah council, and to 
    abide by the council’s decisions; the banks operations will be overseen by a 
    shar’i committee. The shar’i policy of this bank states that the bank is 
    committing itself from the outset to applying sharee’ah in all its 
    operations. 

    This is a good sign, praise be to Allaah. We ask Allaah to 
    bless them and help them. You can also get in touch with the members of the 
    shar’i committee to find out more and put your mind at ease.

67797,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/67797,Will a person attain the reward of being in the first row even if there is only one row in the mosque?,"Is it better to go to a mosque in which there is a large number of worshippers, even if it is far away? Will I attain the reward of being in the first row even if there is only one row in the mosque in which I pray?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    The evidence indicates that the reward for praying in 
    congregation increases with the number of worshippers. We have explained 
    that in the answer to question no. 
    38194. 

    The reward for the steps that you take to the mosque, no 
    matter how far away it is, is recorded for you with Allaah, as the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Every step that is 
    taken towards prayer is a charity.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2989; Muslim, 
    1009. 
Muslim (665) narrated 
    that Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: Some land 
    near the mosque became vacant, and Banu Salimah wanted to move there and be 
    close to the mosque. News of that reached the Messenger of Allaah  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and he said to them, “I have 
    heard that you want to move near the mosque.” They said, “Yes, O Messenger 
    of Allaah, we want to do that.” He said, “O Banu Salimah, stay where you 
    are, for your steps are recorded; stay where you are, for your steps are 
    recorded.” 

    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: What this 
    means is stay where you are, for your steps will be recorded and the many 
    steps that you take to the mosque will be recorded for you. Banu Salimah was 
    a well-known tribe of the Ansaar. End quote from Sharh Muslim, 
    5/169. 

    It should be noted that the criteria for deciding whether to 
    pray in one mosque or another includes other matters besides the number of 
    worshippers and the number of steps taken to reach the mosque, such as 
    whether the imam and congregation adhere to the Sunnah, how keen they are to 
    establish prayer as enjoined by Allaah, with proper focus and humility, 
    straightening the rows and other things that make the prayer more complete 
    and perfect. In some mosques there may be circles for teaching or memorizing 
    the Book of Allaah, so a person should have a share of that and should not 
    miss out on such things, even if the number of the people in the mosque is 
    small. 

    Proper understanding dictates that one should weigh up the 
    quality of one's deeds and prioritize accordingly, and strive to attain 
    reward as much as possible. 

    Secondly: 

    There are several ahaadeeth about the virtue of the first 
    row, such as that narrated by al-Bukhaari (615) and Muslim (437) from Abu 
    Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him), according to which the Messenger 
    of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If the 
    people knew what (reward) there is in the call and the first row, and there 
    was no other way to settle the matter than drawing lots, they would draw 
    lots for it.”  

    Abu Dawood (664) and al-Nasaa’i (811) narrated that al-Bara’ 
    ibn ‘Aazib said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) used to walk up and down the rows, wiping our shoulders and 
    chests, and he would say, “Do not let your rows be ragged lest this create 
    disharmony in your hearts”, and he used to say, “Allaah and the  angels send 
    blessings on the front rows.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh 
    al-Nasaa’i. 

    This was also narrated by Ibn Maajah (997) with the wording: 
    “Allaah and the angels send blessings upon the first row.” 

    What is meant by the first row is that which is directly 
    behind the imam, whether there is a barrier or not. And it was said that it 
    is the first complete row that is directly behind the imam, or it means 
    those who came to the prayer first, even if they pray in the back rows. 
Al-Nawawi (may Allaah 
    have mercy on him) said: The first view is the one that is sound. This was 
    stated by the scholars. The other two views are clearly mistaken. 

    End quote from Fath al-Baari, 2/244. 

    It makes no difference whether there is one row or several 
    rows in the mosque. The row that is closest to the imam is the first row, 
    and its people are promised reward as indicated by the general meaning of 
    the ahaadeeth.
