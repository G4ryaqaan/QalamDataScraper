What should we do? Should he be named and the ‘aqeeqah sacrificed for him? If anything else needs to be done, I hope that you can help us with that. May Allaah reward you with good.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
There is a difference of opinion among the scholars regarding a miscarriage that happens after four months. That which is stated in the fatwas of our shaykhs is that the foetus should be named, washed and shrouded, and the funeral prayer offered for him, and he should be buried with the Muslims, and the ‘aqeeqah should be done for him. 
The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked: 
Please advise me concerning my wife; before she died she miscarried a foetus, at four months of pregnancy. She took him and buried him without offering the funeral prayer. Please advise me as to whether I should have done anything. 
They replied: 
He should have been washed and shrouded, and the funeral prayer offered for him, according to the correct scholarly opinion, so long as the age of four months had been reached, because of the general meaning of the report narrated by Abu Dawood and al-Tirmidhi from al-Mugheerah ibn Shu’bah (may Allaah be pleased with him), that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The funeral prayer should be offered for the miscarried foetus.” But this was not done, and you do not have to do anything now. 
Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 8/406. 
And they said: 
If the age of four months has not been reached, then the funeral prayer should not be offered, and he should not be named or the ‘aqeeqah offered, because the soul had not been breathed into him. 
Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 8/408. 
Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: 
If a foetus is miscarried before four months should the ‘aqeeqah be done for him or not?  
He replied: 
If the foetus is miscarried before four months of pregnancy, then no ‘aqeeqah should be done, and he should not be named or the funeral prayer offered for him, and he may be buried anywhere. 
But after four months the soul has been breathed into him, so he should be named and shrouded and the funeral prayer should be offered for him, and he should be buried with the Muslims, and the ‘aqeeqah should be done for him in our view. Some of the scholars said that the ‘aqeeqah should not be done unless he lived for seven days, but the correct view is that the ‘aqeeqah should be offered for him because he will be resurrected on the Day of Resurrection, and he will intercede for his parents. 
As’ilat al-Baab il-Maftooh, Q. 653. 
Secondly: 
The blood which comes out when the foetus is miscarried at this stage is nifaas, so the woman should not pray or fast, and it is haraam for her husband to have intercourse with her. This blood is regarded as nifaas if the woman miscarries a foetus in which human features can be seen. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: 
The scholars said: If the foetus comes out and human features can be seen in it, then the blood that comes after that is nifaas, so she should stop praying and fasting, and her husband should avoid intercourse with her until she becomes pure. If the embryo comes out unformed, then the bleeding is not regarded as nifaas, rather it is irregular bleeding which does not prevent her from praying, fasting etc. 
The scholars said: The minimum period after which features appears is eighty-one days.

50112,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50112,Ruling on the Ramadan soccer league,What is the ruling on the Ramadan soccer league which has become popular among the people in Ramadaan?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    What the believer should do is to make the most of special 
    occasions and worship his Lord a great deal at those times. One of the 
    greatest of these occasions is the month of Ramadaan. 

    How great are the acts of worship that a Muslim does in 
    Ramadaan, which bring a great reward. 

    Ramadaan is the month of fasting, praying at night, reading 
    Qur’aan, remembering Allaah (dhikr), making du’a’, doing ‘umrah, giving 
    iftar to those who are fasting, giving charity, and being kind and generous 
    to the needy. It is the month of i’tikaaf and turning away from this world 
    and turning to Allaah, and striving in worship. 

    The virtues of Ramadaan are too many to name, and too 
    well-known to need to be mentioned here. 

    Every night in Ramadaan Allaah has those whom He ransoms from 
    the Fire. In it the gates of Paradise are opened and the gates of Hell are 
    shut, and the devils are chained up.  There are many means of forgiveness in 
    this month, such as fasting, qiyaam al-layl and spending the night of Laylat 
    al-Qadr in prayer. The one who is truly deprived is the one who is deprived 
    of the goodness of this month, and the one who is truly a loser is the one 
    who has not been forgiven by the end of this month.  

    If a person is not forgiven in Ramadaan, when will he be 
    forgiven?! 

    If he does not turn to Allaah in Ramadaan, when will he turn 
    to Him?! 

    Hence the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said: “May his nose be rubbed in the dust, a man for whom Ramadaan 
    comes and then goes before he is forgiven.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3545; 
    classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
If he does not make the 
    most of his time and fill it with worship of Allaah in this month, when will 
    he do that?! 

    In Ramadaan the Muslim moves from one act of worship to 
    another, from prayer to reading Qur’aan to reciting tasbeeh and tahleel, 
    from offering iftar to those who are fasting to praying qiyaam al-layl and 
    tahajjud to repentance  and praying for forgiveness in the moments before 
    dawn… etc. 

    In question 26869 we have presented a suggested schedule for 
    the Muslim in Ramadaan. 

    When can a believer find time to waste in this blessed month? 
    By Allaah, if time could be bought the wise man would spend all he has to 
    buy it. Time is a person’s life and will certainly come to an end. Some 
    people spend their lives obeying Allaah and some spend their lives obeying 
    the Shaytaan and their own whims and desires. The Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) indeed spoke the truth when he said: “Every 
    person is striving for himself and selling his soul, so he will ransom 
    himself or doom himself.” Narrated by Muslim, 223. 

    What this means is that every person is striving; some of 
    them strive for the sake of Allaah by worshipping and obeying Him, so they 
    save themselves from punishment, and some strive for the Shaytaan by 
    following their own whims and desires, so they are doomed. This was the view 
    of al-Nawawi. 

    The least that can be said concerning these games with regard 
    to this month is that they are a waste of time. There is nothing more 
    precious to a person than his time for it is his life. 

    Moreover, why should Ramadaan be singled out for these games? 
    Why not do them in Sha’baan or Rajab or Shawwaal? 

    Why is Ramadaan singled out for soap operas and other 
    programming offered by TV channels, so that for many people Ramadaan has 
    become a month of soccer, TV shows and staying up late etc? 

    These people are negligent of the reason why Allaah enjoined 
    fasting in the month of Ramadaan, which is so that people may attain taqwa 
    (piety) as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “O you who believe! Observing As-Sawm (the fasting) is 
    prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, that you may 
    become Al-Muttaqoon (the pious)”

    [al-Baqarah 2:183]
What do they know about 
    taqwa, which means obeying Allaah and refraining from that which Allaah has 
    forbidden? 

    The believer should be wise and firm with himself, he should 
    not follow his whims and desires lest he regret it at the time when regret 
    will be to no avail. 

    May his nose be rubbed in the dust, the man who wastes his 
    time in Ramadaan with idle leisure and nights spent doing things other than 
    worshipping Allaah, until Ramadaan ends and he has only increased in sin and 
    being far away from Allaah. 

    We ask Allaah to set the affairs of the Muslims straight and 
    to bring them back to their religion.  May He cause us to live until 
    Ramadaan comes and help us to obey Him and worship Him properly, and accept 
    our worship from us, for He is Ever Near and Ever Responsive.",Islam Q&A
50120,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50120,What is meant by the white and black thread mentioned in the verse on fasting,What is meant in the verse in which Allaah says “and eat and drink until the white thread (light) of dawn appears to you distinct from the black thread (darkness of night)”?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Allaah, may 
    He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“It is 
    made lawful for you to have sexual relations with your wives on the night of 
    As‑Sawm (the fasts). They are Libaas [i.e. body-cover, or screen, or Sakan 
    (i.e. you enjoy the pleasure of living with them)] for you and you are the 
    same for them. Allaah knows that you used to deceive yourselves, so He 
    turned to you (accepted your repentance) and forgave you. So now have sexual 
    relations with them and seek that which Allaah has ordained for you 
    (offspring), and eat and drink until the white thread (light) of dawn 
    appears to you distinct from the black thread (darkness of night), then 
    complete your Sawm (fast) till the nightfall”

    [al-Baqarah 2:187]
What this 
    means is that Allaah has allowed those who are fasting to eat and drink at 
    night until he is certain that dawn has come. What is meant by the white 
    thread is the day, and the black thread is the night. 
Al-Haafiz 
    said: What the verse means is until the whiteness of day can be 
    distinguished from the blackness of night. This happens when the true dawn 
    appears. 
The words 
    “of dawn” serve to explain what is meant by “the white thread” and there is 
    no need to explain what is meant by the black thread because explaining the 
    one makes it clear what is meant by the other.  End quote. 
Some of the 
    Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) understood the verse in a manner 
    other than what it means. They thought that what was meant was a thread in 
    the real sense. One of them would put two threads, one white and one black, 
    beneath his pillow or tie them to his foot, and he would carry on eating 
    until he could tell them apart. They misunderstood it because at first 
    Allaah revealed the verse without the words “of dawn”, then after a while 
    (some scholars say that it was after a year), Allaah revealed the verse with 
    the words “of dawn”. Then they realized that what was meant by the white 
    thread was the light of dawn (the day) and what was meant by the black 
    thread was night. 
Al-Bukhaari 
    (1917) and Muslim (1091) narrated that Sahl ibn Sa’d said: The verse “and 
    eat and drink until the white thread appears to you distinct from the black 
    thread” [al-Baqarah 2:187] was revealed, and the words “of dawn” were 
    not revealed. When people wanted to fast, one of them would tie a white 
    thread and a black thread to his foot, then he would carry on eating until 
    he could tell them apart when he looked at them. Then after that Allaah 
    revealed the words, “of dawn,” 
    then they realized that what was meant by that was night and day. 
The Sahaabah 
    interpreted the word thread according to its apparent meaning, as they 
    understood it, then when the words “of dawn” were revealed, they understood 
    what was meant. 
Al-Bukhaari 
    (1916) narrated that ‘Adiyy ibn Haatim (may Allaah be pleased with him) 
    said: “When the words ‘until the white thread (light) of dawn appears to 
    you distinct from the black thread (darkness of night)’ [al-Baqarah 2:187 – 
    interpretation of the meaning] were revealed, I took a black rope and a 
    white rope and put them beneath my pillow, and I started to look at them 
    during the night, but I could not see any distinction between them. The next 
    morning I went to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) and told him about that. He said, ‘Rather that is the blackness of 
    the night and the whiteness of the day.’”  
According to 
    a report narrated by al-Bukhaari (4510) he said: “You must be huge.” 
    According to another report (4509) he said: “Your pillow must be very wide, 
    if the white thread and the black thread are beneath your pillow.” And 
    according to another report: (4510) “The back of your head must be very 
    wide.” 
The story of 
    ‘Adiyy ibn Haatim occurred after Allaah had revealed the words “of dawn”, 
    i.e., after the hadeeth of Sahl quoted above. Some of the scholars explained 
    Adiyy’s mistake of misunderstanding the verse even though the words “of 
    dawn” had been revealed, by noting that the hadeeth of Sahl had not reached 
    ‘Adiyy’, or that in the dialect of his people the words “white thread” and 
    “black thread” were not used to refer to day and night. 
Hence Ibn 
    Hibbaan commented on the hadeeth of ‘Adiyy by noting that “the language of 
    the Arabs varies,” and pointed out that in the language of ‘Adiyy, the 
    darkness of night and the light of day were not described as a black thread 
    and white thread. Al-Qurtubi said: The hadeeth of ‘Adiyy is later than the 
    hadeeth of Sahl. It is as if ‘Adiyy had not heard what was said in the 
    hadeeth of Sahl, rather he only heard the verse and understood it as it 
    sounded to him. End quote. 
Al-Haafiz 
    said: As for ‘Adiyy, it is as if in the language of his people they did not 
    refer to the dawn as a thread, or he forgot the words “of dawn” until the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) reminded him of 
    that. 
Al-Nawawi 
    said, following al-Qaadi ‘Iyaad: Rather the black and white threads were 
    interpreted according to their apparent meaning by some Bedouin who did not 
    have much knowledge, such as the men from whom Sahl narrated, and some of 
    those in whose dialect the dawn was not referred to as a thread, such as 
    ‘Adiyy. End quote. 
With regard 
    to the words of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him), “The back of your head must be very wide,” some of them claimed that 
    what the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) meant by 
    that was that he was unintelligent. They claimed that if the back of the 
    head is wide, this is a sign of stupidity, and they wrote poetry about that. 
    But many of the scholars rejected this, such as al-Qurtubi, al-Qaadi ‘Iyaad 
    and al-Nawawi. 
Al-Qurtubi 
    said: 
Some people 
    interpreted this as a criticism of him for that misunderstanding. It is as 
    if they understood it as an accusation of ignorance and lack of 
    understanding, but it is not as they say. Rather he meant – and Allaah knows 
    best – if your pillow covers the two threads to which Allaah referred then 
    it must be wide indeed. Hence immediately after that he said:  “Rather that 
    is the blackness of the night and the whiteness of the day.”  It is as if he 
    said: How can they fit under your pillow? And the words “The back of your 
    head must be very wide” mean that the pillow which covers the night and day 
    cannot be rested upon except by a head that is very wide. End quote. 
Al-Qaadi 
    said: What this means is that if you put under your pillow the two threads 
    that Allaah meant, namely the night and day, and your pillow covered them, 
    then it must be very wide. This is what is meant in the other report 
    narrated in Saheeh al-Bukhaari – “The back of your head must be very 
    wide” – and in the other report: “You must be huge.” 
See: Fath 
    al-Baari, commentary on hadeeth no. 1917 and 1916’ Sharh 
    Muslim by al-Nawawi, hadeeth no. 1090, 1091 
Among the 
    rulings that are derived from this verse is the ruling that if a person is 
    unsure whether dawn has broken, he may carry on eating and drinking until he 
    is sure of it, because Allaah says “until the white thread (light) of 
    dawn appears to you distinct from the black thread”. 
‘Abd 
    al-Razzaaq narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas said: Allaah has permitted you to eat 
    and drink so long as you are not sure. Al-Haafiz said: its isnaad is 
    saheeh. 
Ibn Abi 
    Shaybah narrated that Abu’l-Duha said: A man asked Ibn ‘Abbaas about sahoor 
    and Ibn ‘Abbaas said: Eat so long as you are uncertain, until you are no 
    longer uncertain. This is the view of the majority of scholars. 
Shaykh Ibn 
    ‘Uthaymeen said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’ (6/247): 
If a person 
    is not fasting, and he is not sure whether dawn has broken, his fast is 
    valid, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“So now 
    have sexual relations with them and seek that which Allaah has ordained for 
    you (offspring), and eat and drink until the white thread (light) of dawn 
    appears to you distinct from the black thread (darkness of night), then 
    complete your Sawm (fast) till the nightfall”

    [al-Baqarah 2:187]
The opposite 
    of certainty is uncertainty and doubt; so long as we are not certain, we may 
    eat and drink. This issue falls into five categories: 

    1-If he is certain that dawn has 
    not come, such as if dawn comes at five o’clock 
    and he eats and drinks at four-thirty, his fast is valid.

    2-If he is certain that dawn has 
    come, such as if he eats at five-thirty, then his fast is invalid.

    3-If he eats and he is unsure 
    whether dawn has come or not, but he thinks it most likely that it has not 
    come, then his fast is valid.

    4-If he eats and drinks, and he 
    thinks it most likely that dawn has come, then his fast is valid.

    5-If he eats and drinks and is 
    unsure, then his fast is valid. End quote.

50147,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50147,The meaning of the word Anwaat,"In the hadeeth of Abu Waaqid al-Laythi (may Allaah be pleased with him) it says: “We went out with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to Hunayn and we were new in Islam. The mushrikeen had a tree to which they would go and spend time (to seek blessings) and they used to hang their weapons on it, it was called Dhat Anwaat…” What is the meaning of the word Anwaat?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.This hadeeth 
    was narrated by Imam Ahmad (2139) and by al-Tirmidhi (2180), who said it is 
    hasan saheeh. It was also narrated by Ibn Abi Aasim in al-Sunnah. 
    Al-Manaawi said: its isnaad is saheeh. And it was classed as saheeh by 
    al-Albaani in Riyaadh al-Sunnah, no. 76. 
These words were 
    narrated in the hadeeth of Abu Waaqid al-Laythi (may Allaah be pleased with 
    him): They went out from Makkah with the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) to Hunayn. The kuffaar had a tree to which 
    they would go and spend time (to seek blessings) and they used to hang their 
    weapons on it, and it was called Dhaat Anwaat. We passed by a large green 
    tree and we said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah, make for us a dhaat anwaat.’ The 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    ‘By the One in Whose hand is my soul, you have said the same as the people 
    of Moosa said: make for us a god as they have gods. Verily you are a people 
    who know not. These are ways that you will certainly follow as did those who 
    came before you, step by step.’ 
According to 
    a report narrated by Ibn Abi ‘Aasim in Kitaab al-Sunnah: And we were 
    new in Islam (at that time). 
With regard 
    to the words Dhaat Anwaat: Anwaat is the plural of the word nawt, 
    which refers to anything that is hung up. Dhaat Anwaat is the tree on which 
    these things were hung. Ibn al-Atheer said in al-Nihaayah: This is 
    the name of a specific tree that belonged to the mushrikeen, on which they 
    used to hang their weapons and to which they would go and spend time (to 
    seek blessings). They asked him to make something like that for them, and he 
    forbade them to do that. 
With regard 
    to the phrase, “By the One in Whose hand is my soul, you have said the same 
    as the people of Moosa said: make for us a god as they have gods. Verily you 
    are a people who know not”: Here the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) likened what they had said to the words of the Children 
    of Israel when they passed by some people who were worshipping their idols. 
    They asked Moosa (peace be upon him) to make for them a god that they could 
    worship as those people had a god. 
With regard 
    to the phrase “These are ways that you will certainly follow as did those 
    who came before you”: i.e., this is the way of the nations who came before 
    you. What is meant here is the way of the people who follow whims and 
    desires and innovations that they introduced based on their own ideas after 
    their Prophets were gone, and they changed their religion.  
According to 
    the hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed that was narrated by al-Bukhaari: “You will follow 
    the ways of those who came before you, handspan by handspan, cubit by cubit, 
    until even if they entered the hole of a lizard you will follow them.” We 
    said: “O Messenger of Allaah, (do you mean) the Jews and the Christians?” He 
    said: “Who else?” 
Al-Nawawi 
    said: This is a manifest miracle of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him), for what he foretold indeed came to pass. 
From this 
    hadeeth we learn the following: 

    1-To beware of shirk (associating 
    others with Allaah) and that a person may think that something is good and 
    will bring him closer to Allaah, when it is as far removed as it can be from 
    the mercy of his Lord and will bring him closer to His wrath.

    2-Seeking blessings from trees 
    and rocks and being attached to them are all acts of shirk which have 
    happened in this ummah. Whoever falls into these things is following the 
    path of the Jews and Christians and forsaking the path of the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).

    3-What counts is meanings, not 
    words. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) likened 
    what they said to what the Children of Israel said, even though they were 
    not blatantly asking for a god instead of Allaah.

    4-It is forbidden to imitate the 
    people of the Jaahiliyyah and the people of the Book in things that are 
    unique to them and in their acts of worship.

    5-It shows that when a person has 
    moved away from falsehood to which he was accustomed, there is no guarantee 
    that something of those old traditions will not be left in his heart, 
    because the Sahaabah who asked him for that had only been Muslims for a few 
    days, as they became Muslim on the day of the conquest of Makkah, then the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) took them out on 
    the campaign of Hunayn. This incident took place on the way to Hunayn.

      building in which the Christians practice their rituals, which include 
      kufr, belief in trinity and worshipping someone other than Allaah. 

    Based on this, building churches or collecting donations to 
    build them, renovate them and support them, is an serious evil action, 
    because it involves helping to spread kufr and approving of it. 

    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: 

    Whoever believes that churches are houses of God, or that He 
    is worshipped in them, or that what the Jews and Christians do is worship of 
    Allaah and obedience to Him and His Messenger, or that He likes that or is 
    pleased with it, is a kaafir, because his beliefs imply that their religion 
    is valid, and that is kufr. If he helps them to open churches and establish 
    their religion, and believes that this is an act of worship or obedience, 
    then he is a kaafir, because this belief implies that their religion is 
    valid. 

    Elsewhere he said: 
Whoever believes that 
    visiting the churches of the ahl al-dhimmah is a way to draw closer to 
    Allaah is an apostate. If he is unaware that this is haraam, he must be 
    told, and if he persists in that he becomes an apostate, because he has 
    implicitly denied the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning):

    It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (14/482): 
It is not permissible for 
    a Muslim who believes in Allaah and the Last Day to build a church or a 
    place of worship that is not based on Islam with which Allaah sent Muhammad 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), because that is one of the 
    greatest means of helping in kufr and making its symbols manifest, and 
    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Help you one another in Al‑Birr and At‑Taqwa (virtue, 
    righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and 
    transgression”

    [al-Maa'idah 5:2]
You have to remind him of 
    Allaah and advise him to repent to Allaah, and to give up the work he is 
    doing lest he fall into kufr and apostasy, and his good deeds come to 
    nothing without him realizing. 

    Based on this, there is the fear that something worse will 
    happen to your friend than his fasting not being accepted, namely kufr. We 
    ask Allaah to guide him and to help him to do all that is good.

Excuses which allow praying sitting down","Praise be to Allah.Is standing a pillar of prayer?
In the answer to question no 50684  we have stated that standing is a pillar or essential part of the obligatory prayers, so the prayer of one who prays sitting when he is able to stand is not valid. But like all other obligatory duties, this may be waived in the case of inability to do it. 
An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Majmu` (4/201): 
“The Ummah unanimously agreed that whoever is unable to stand in an obligatory prayer may pray sitting down, and he does not have to repeat the prayer. Our companions said: his reward will not be less than the reward for offering the prayer standing up, because he is excused. It was proven in Sahih Al-Bukhari that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If a person is sick or is travelling, the reward of what he used to do when he was healthy and not travelling with be written for him.””  
Excuses which allow praying sitting down
The guidelines for the excuse which allows one not to stand and to offer obligatory prayers sitting down , are as follows: 

That he be unable to stand
That it will make his sickness worse
That it will delay his recovery
That it should cause great difficulty of such a scale that he will be unable to focus properly. If the difficulty caused is less than that, then it is not permissible for him to sit.

Al-Bukhari (1117) narrated that `Imran ibn Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I had haemorrhoids and I asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about praying. He said: “Pray standing, and if you cannot, then whilst sitting, and if you cannot, then whilst lying on your side.” 
Al-Hafidh (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The words “If you cannot” were quoted as evidence by those who say that a sick person should not start to sit whilst praying until after he becomes unable to stand. This was narrated by `Iyad from Ash-Shafi`i. It was narrated from Malik, Ahmad and Is-Haq that it is not essential that a person be unable to stand, rather if it is very difficult for him to stand (then he may sit). 
The well-known view among the Shafi`is is that what is meant by not being able is that it is very difficult to stand, or there is the fear that the sickness may be made worse or it may lead to the death of the patient. Slight difficulty is not sufficient (as an excuse ). Another example of great hardship is dizziness in the case of a passenger on a boat who fears that he may drown if he prays standing in the boat. 
The majority also quote as evidence the hadith of Ibn ‘Abbas which was narrated by At-Tabarani (may Allah have mercy on him): “He should pray standing, but if he encounters difficulty then sitting, and if he encounters difficulty, then lying down.”” (Fat-h Al-Bari) 
The Hadith of Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) which was mentioned by Al-Hafidh was also quoted by Al-Haythami in Majma` Al-Zawa’id, 2897, where he says: 
“This was narrated by At-Tabarani in Al-Awsat. He said: It was not narrated from Ibn Jurayj except by Halas ibn Muhammad Al-Dab’i. I (Al-Haythami) say: I cannot find anyone who wrote his biography, but the rest of the men in its chain of narrators are trustworthy.”
Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Mughni, 1/443: 
“If he is able to stand (he should do so), otherwise if he fears that his sickness will become worse or his recovery will be slowed or it is extremely difficult for him to stand, then he may pray sitting down. Something similar was said by Malik and Ishaq… because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and has not laid upon you in religion any hardship” [Al-Hajj 22:78] 
The obligation of standing in this case is a hardship. 
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed sitting down when he was wounded in his right cheek; it seems that he was not completely unable to stand, but because it was difficult for him to stand, he was excused.”
An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Majmu`, 4/201:
“Our companions said: Being unable does not necessarily mean that one cannot stand and slight difficulty is not enough reason for not standing; rather what counts is obvious difficulty. If a person fears immense hardship or worsening of the sickness etc., or if a passenger in a boat fears that he may drown or become dizzy, he may pray sitting down, and he does not have to repeat the prayer. Imam Al-Haramayn said: What I think with regard to the guidelines on what constitutes an inability to stand is that standing would cause hardship that would prevent him from focusing properly, because proper focus is the purpose of prayer.”
The view favoured by Imam Al-Haramayn (may Allah have mercy on him) is the view which Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) thought most likely to be correct. He said:  
“The guideline on what constitutes hardship is that which prevents one from focusing properly. Proper focus means having presence of mind and being at ease. If standing will cause intense anxiety which makes one ill at ease and makes him wish to reach the end of Al-Fatihah quickly so that he can bow, because it is too hard to stand, then he may pray sitting down.” (Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti’, 4/326.
