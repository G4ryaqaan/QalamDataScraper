doesn’t pray and she is withholding from having intercourse with him","My husband doesn't pray 5 times a day and
      constantly, I have encouraged him to do so with no avail. Since he hasn't taken heed of my
      requests I have withheld myself from engaging in intercourse with him. He exclaims that my
      actions are inappropriate, saying that it is blasphemous for me to use prayer as an
      incentive for intercourse. Is he correct?",,,"Praise be to Allah.It should be known that the one who does not pray any of
    the prayers and persists in not doing so, according to the Sahaabah and the majority of
    scholars, is counted as a kaafir and it is not permissible to marry him or eat meat
    slaughtered by him. If the husband does not pray at all, then he is taking a very serious
    risk and it is not permissible for you to stay with him. You have to remind him and scare
    him with this. Withholding yourself from having intercourse with him is the right thing to
    do, until he starts to pray, because the one who does not pray is counted as a kaafir, as
    it was reported in Saheeh Muslim from the hadeeth of Jaabir that the Prophet 
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
All that stands between a man and shirk and kufr is his giving up
    prayer. And he also said:
The covenant that separates us from them is salaah, and whoever
    gives up prayer is a kaafir.
Abd-Allaah ibn Shaqeeq said: the companions of the Prophet 
 (peace
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used not to count the giving up of any action as
    kufr, apart from prayer. You have to warn your husband against neglecting the
    prayer. If he persists, it is not permissible for you to stay with him because you are a
    Muslim and he is something else. May Allaah help the Muslims to do what Allaah has
    commanded and to obey Him. You have to advise and scare him, and may Allaah bring about
    good for him through that.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

4509,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4509,Was the Prophet Created From Light?,"Most people think that things were created from the light of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and that his light was created from the light of Allaah. They narrate, “I am the light of Allaah and everything is from my light” and also, “The first thing that Allaah created was the light of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).” Is there any basis for this? They also narrate “I am ‘Arab without (the letter) ‘ayn, i.e., Rabb, and I am Ahmad without (the letter) meem, i.e., Ahad.” Is there any basis for this?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah
    be upon him) has been described as being light from the light of Allaah. If what is meant
    by this is that he himself is from the light of Allaah, then this goes against the
    Qur’aan, which refers to his being human. If what is meant is that he is light in the
    sense that he brought the Revelation by which whoever Allah wills of His creation is
    guided, then this is correct. The committee has issued a fatwa concerning this matter, as
    follows:
“The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) has
    light which is the light of the message and guidance from Allaah, through which Allaah
    guides whomsoever He will of His slaves. No doubt the light of the message and of guidance
    comes from Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
‘It is not given to any human being that Allaah should speak to
    him unless (it be)by inspiration, or from behind a veil, or (that) He sends a Messenger to
    reveal what He wills by His Leave. Verily, He is Most High, Most Wise.
And thus We have sent to you (O Muhammad) Roohan (an Inspiration, and a
    Mercy) of Our Command. You knew not what is the Book, nor what is Faith? But We have made
    it (this Qur’aan) a light wherewith We guide whosoever of Our slaves We will. And
    verily, you (O Muhammad) are indeed guiding (mankind) to the Straight Path (i.e.,
    Allaah’s religion of Islamic monotheism), -- 
The path of Allaah, to Whom belongs all that is in the heavens and all
    that is in the earth. Verily, all the matters at the end go to Allaah (for
    decision).”[al-Shura 42:51-53]
This light is not derived from the Seal of the Awliya’ as some
    heretics claim. The body of the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was
    blood and flesh and bone, and so on. He was created from a father and a mother, and had no
    existence before he was born. The reports which say that the first thing created by Allaah
    was the light of the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), or that Allaah
    grasped a handful of the light from His Face and that this handful was Muhammad 
 (peace
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him), then He looked at it and it formed drops, and from
    each of these drops He created a Prophet, or He created all of creation from the light of
    the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) – all of these reports and
    the like are not saheeh (authentic), and nothing like this has been narrated from the Prophet 
 (peace
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him).”
From the fatwa quoted above, it is clear that this is a false belief.
As for the report which says “I am ‘Arab without (the
    letter) ‘ayn, i.e., Rabb, and I am Ahmad without (the letter) meem,
    i.e., Ahad” – the attributes of Lordship (ruboobiyah, from Rabb
    meaning Lord) and Absolute Unity (Ahad meaning One) are attributes that belong
    uniquely to Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted. It is not permissible for any one of
    His creation to be described as “the Lord (Rabb)” or as being One (Ahad)
    in absolute terms. These are attributes that belong exclusively to Allaah, and are not
    used to describe the Messengers or any other human beings. May Allaah bless our Prophet
    Muhammad and his family and companions.

Question:
Is it said that Allaah created the heavens and earth for the purpose of
    creating the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)? What is the meaning of
    the words, “Were it not for you, the universe [lit. heavenly bodies] would not have
    been created”? Is there any basis for this hadeeth (prophetic narration)? Is it saheeh (authentic) or not? Please give
    us the facts.
Answer:
The heavens and earth were not created for the sake of the Prophet 
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). They were created for the reason mentioned by
    Allaah in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):
“It is Allaah Who has created seven heavens and of the earth
    the like thereof (i.e., seven). His Command descends between them (heavens and earth),
    that you may know that Allaah has power over all things, and that Allaah surrounds
    (comprehends) all things in (His) Knowledge.” [al-Talaaq 65:12]
As for the hadeeth mentioned, it is falsely attributed to the
    Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and has no grounds for authenticity.
    May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.","Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 1/312"

4524,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4524,Who do Muslims worship?,Who do Muslims worship?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Before answering, we would like to express our appreciation for your interest, at such a young age, in the religion of Islam. May Allah open the door for you to find much blessing through your asking this question, and decree for you guidance such as you have never thought of. Allah [the Arabic name for the One True God – Translator] says in the Quran [the Holy Book of Islam] (interpretation of the meaning):
 “This is the Guidance of Allah with which He guides whomsoever He will of His slaves…” [al-An’aam 6:88]
“And whomsoever Allah wills to guide, He opens his breast to Islam…” [al-An’aam 6:125]
With regard to this important question – who do the Muslims worship? – the answer is to be found in the Holy Quran, which is the Scripture of Islam, and in the words of the Prophet of Islam, Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who received Revelation from his Lord.
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“In the name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. All praises and thanks be to Allah, the Lord of the ‘Aalameen (mankind, jinns and all that exists), the Most Beneficient, the Most Merciful, the Only Owner (and the Only Ruling Judge) of the Day of Recompense (i.e., the Day of Resurrection). You (Alone) we worship, and You (alone) we ask for help (for each and every thing).” [al-Faatihah 1:1-5]
“O mankind! Worship your Lord (Allah), Who has created you and those before you so that you may become al-muttaqoon (the pious).” [al-Baqarah 2:21]
“Such is Allah, your Lord! None has the right to be worshipped but He, the Creator of all things. So worship Him (Alone), and He is the Wakeel (Trustee, Disposer of affairs, Guardian) over all things.” [al-An’aam 6:102]
“And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him, and that you be dutiful to your parents. If one of them or both of them attain old age in your life, say not to them a word of disrespect, nor shout at them but address them in terms of honour.” [al-Isra’ 17:23]
Muslims worship Allah [the One True God] whom all the Prophets worshipped. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Or were you witnesses when death approached Ya’qoob [Jacob]? When he said unto his sons, ‘What will you worship after me?’ They said, ‘We shall worship your God, the God of your fathers, Ibraaheem [Abraham], Ismaa’eel [Ishmael] and Is-haaq [Isaac], One God, and to Him we submit (in Islam).” [al-Baqarah 2:133]
The Muslims worship Allah and call others who follow different religions to worship Allah Alone, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Say [O Muhammad]: ‘O People of the Scripture [Jews and Christians]: come to a word that is just between us and you, that we worship none but Allah, and we associate no partners with Him, and that none of us shall take others as lords besides Allah.’ Then, if they turn away, say, ‘Bear witness that we are Muslims.’” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:64]
It is Allah Alone Whom Nooh [Noah] (peace be upon him) called his people to worship, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Indeed, We sent Nooh [Noah] to his people and he said: ‘O my people! Worship Allah! You have no other god but Him. Certainly, I fear for you the torment of a Great Day!’” [al-A’raaf 7:59]
It is Allah Alone whom the Messiah [Jesus] (peace be upon him) called people to worship, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Surely they have disbelieved who say: ‘Allah is the Messiah [Jesus] son of Maryam [Mary].’ But the Messiah said: ‘O Children of Israel! Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.’ Verily, whosoever sets up partners in worship with Allah, then Allah has forbidden Paradise for him, and the Fire will be his abode. And for the zaalimoon (polytheists and wrong-doers) there are no helpers.” [al-Maa’idah 5:73]
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And (remember) when Allah will say (on the Day of Resurrection): ‘O ‘Eesa [Jesus], son of Maryam [Mary]! Did you say unto men: ‘Worship me and my mother as two gods besides Allah?’ He will say: ‘Glory be to You! It was not for me to say what I had no right (to say). Had I said such a thing, You would surely have known it. You know what is in my inner-self though I do not know what is in Yours. You, only You, are the All-Knower of all that is hidden and unseen.
Never did I say to them aught except what You (Allah) did command me to say: “Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.” And I was a witness over them while I dwelt amongst them, but when You took me up, You were the Watcher over them, and You are a Witness to all things.’” [al-Maa’idah 5:116-117]
When Allah spoke to His Prophet Moosa [Moses] (peace be upon him), He said (interpretation of the meaning):
“Verily, I am Allah! None has the right to be worshipped but I, so worship Me, and perform al-Salaah [prayer] for My Remembrance.” [Ta-Ha 20:14]
Allah commanded His Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) as follows (interpretation of the meaning):
“Say [O Muhammad]: ‘O mankind! If you are in doubt as to my religion (Islam), then (know that) I will never worship those whom you worship, besides Allah. But I worship Allah Who causes you to die, I am commanded to be one of the believers.” [Yoonus 10:104]
It is Him Alone, with no partner or associate, Whom the angels worship and do not worship anyone or anything besides Him, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):
“To Him belongs whosoever is in the heavens and on earth. And those who are near Him (i.e., the angels) are not too proud to worship Him, nor are they weary (of His worship).” [al-Anbiya’ 21:19]
Everything that is worshipped instead of Allah can neither bring benefit nor cause harm, it can neither create nor provide. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Say (O Muhammad, to mankind); ‘How do you worship besides Allah something which has no power either to harm or to benefit you? But it is Allah Who is the All-Hearer, All-Knower.’” [al-Maa’idah 5:76]
“You worship besides Allah only idols, and you only invent falsehood. Verily, those whom you worship besides Allah have no power to give you provision, so seek your provision from Allah (Alone), and worship Him (Alone), and be grateful to Him. To Him (Alone) you will be brought back.” [al-‘Ankaboot 29:17]
Having explained this, we must complete the topic by asking: why should we worship Allah Alone with no partner or associate? The answer is as follows:
Firstly: because there is nothing and nobody else in the universe that deserves to be worshipped, for Allah is the Creator and Sustainer, Who has created the universe out of nothing and has bestowed so many blessings upon us. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“So glorify Allah, when you come up to the evening [i.e., offer the Maghrib (sunset) and ‘Isha’ (night) prayers], and when you enter the morning [I.e., offer the Fajr (morning) prayers].
And His is all the praise and thanks in the heavens and the earth, and (glorify Him) in the afternoon [i.e., offer ‘Asr (mid-afternoon) prayer] and when you come up to the time when the day begins to decline [i.e., offer the Zuhr (mid-day) prayer].
He brings out the living from the dead, and brings out the dead from the living. And He revives the earth after its death, and thus shall you be brought out (resurrected).
And among His Signs is this, that He created you (Adam) from dust, and then [Hawwa (Eve) from Adam’s rib, then his offspring from the semen, and], - behold you are human beings scattered!
And among His Signs is this, that He created for you wives from among yourselves, that you may find repose in them, and He has put between you affection and mercy. Verily, in that are indeed signs for a people who reflect.
And among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the difference of your languages and colours. Verily in that are indeed signs for men of sound knowledge.
And among His Signs is the sleep that you take by night and by day, and your seeking of His Bounty. Verily, in that are indeed signs for a people who listen.
And among His Signs is that He shows you the lightning, by way of fear and hope, and He sends down water (rain) from the sky, and therewith revives the earth after its death. Verily, in that are indeed signs for a people who understand.
And among His Signs is that the heaven and the earth stand by His Command, then afterwards when He will call you by a single call, behold, you will come out from the earth (ie., from your graves, for reckoning and recompense).
To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. All are obedient to Him.
And He it is Who originates the creation, then will repeat it (after it has perished), and this is easier for Him. His is the highest description (i.e., none has the right to be worshipped but He, and there is nothing comparable unto Him) in the heavens and in the earth. And He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.” [al-Room 30: 17-27]
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Is not He (better than your gods) Who created the heavens and the earth, and sends down for you water (rain) from the sky, whereby We cause to grow wonderful gardens full of beauty and delight? It is not in your ability to cause the growth of their trees. Is there any god with Allah? Nay, but they are a people who ascribe equals (to Him)!
Is not he (better than your gods) Who has made the earth as a fixed abode, and has placed rivers in its midst, and has placed firm mountains therein, and has set a barrier between the two seas (of salt and sweet water). Is there any god with Allah? Nay, but most of them know not.
Is not He (better than your gods) Who responds to the distressed one, when He calls Him, and Who removes the evil, generations after generations. Is there any god with Allah? Little is it that you remember!
Is not He (better than your gods) Who guides you in the darkness of the land and the sea, and Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His mercy (rain)? Is there any god with Allah? High Exalted be Allah above all that they associate as partners (to Him)!
Is not He (better than your so-called gods) Who originates creation, and shall thereafter repeat it, and Who provides for you from heaven and earth? Is there any god with Allah? Say: ‘bring forth your proofs, if you are truthful’
Say: ‘None on the heavens and the earth knows the unseen except Allah, nor can they perceive when they shall be resurrected.’”
[al-Naml 27:60-65]
So is there anyone or anything besides Allah that deserves to be worshipped?
Secondly: Allah did not create us except to worship Him, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And I (Allah) created not the jinns and humans except that they should worship Me (Alone).” [al-Dhaariyaat 51:56]
Thirdly: No one will be saved on the Day of Resurrection except those who used to worship Allah truly and sincerely. After death Allah will resurrect His slaves and call them to account, rewarding or punishing them according to their deeds. No one will be saved on that day except for those who used to worship Allah Alone. The rest will be gathered into a Hell, a terrible fate! The Prophet of Islam, Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), was asked by his Companions: “Will we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection?” He told them:
“Do you doubt that you can see the sun and the moon when the sky is clear?” We [his Companions] said, “No.” He said, “Then you should not doubt that you will see your Lord on that Day, you will see Him as you see them (the sun and moon).” Then he said, “A caller will call out, ‘Let every people go to that which they used to worship.’ So the worshippers of the cross will go with their cross, the worshippers of idols will go with their idols and the worshippers of every god will go with their gods, until there will be left those who used to worship Allah, whether they were righteous or otherwise, and a few of the People of the Book [Jews and Christians]. Then Hell will be brought and shown to them as if it is a mirage. It will be said to the Jews, ‘What did you used to worship?’ They will say, ‘We used to worship ‘Uzayr, the son of God.’ It will be said, ‘You have lied. Allah does not have a wife or son. What do you want?’ They will say, ‘We want something to drink.’ It will be said to them, ‘Drink!’ and they will fall into Hell. Then it will be said to the Christians, ‘What did you used to worship?’ They will say, ‘We used to worship the Messiah, the son of God.’ It will be said, ‘You have lied. Allah does not have a wife or son. What do you want?’ They will say, ‘We want something to drink.’ It will be said to them, ‘Drink!’ and they will fall into Hell. Then there will be left those who used to worship Allah, whether they were righteous or otherwise. It will be said to them, ‘What are you waiting for? All the people have gone.’ They will say, ‘We have separated from them and we need Him more today. We heard a caller saying that every people should follow that which they used to worship, so we are waiting for our Lord.’ He will say, ‘Al-Jabbaar [the Compeller, i.e., Allah] will come…’ And He will say, ‘I am your Lord.’ They will say, ‘You are our Lord,’ but none will speak to Him except the Prophets… then every believer will prostrate to Him.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, no. 6886). These believers are the people of Paradise on whom shall be no fear neither shall they grieve, and they will dwell therein forever.
We hope that this matter has now become clear. In conclusion we can say nothing except that which Allah has said (interpretation of the meaning):
“Whoever goes right, then he goes right only for the benefit of his own self. And whoever goes astray, then he goes astray to his own loss…” [al-Isra’ 17:15]

4526,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4526,Muslim holidays & symbol,"Do Islams have certain holidays that christans don't if so what are they?
What is your holy symbol like ours is the cross, do you have a specific symbol?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Muslims have only two Holy days to celebrate. The two
    Holy days are Eid Alfitir, which follows the holy month of Ramadan, and Eid Aladha, which
    is in the Hajj (holy pilgrimage) season. Muslims celebrate Eid Aladha by slaughtering a
    sheep. The slaughtering of sheep is done in following the footsteps of Prophet Abraham
    when he was ordered by Allah (God) to slaughter his first child, Ishmael. When he told his
    son about it, his son told him to carry on with the order of Allah, and that he will be
    obedient and patient. As Abraham was tempting to slaughter Ishmael, Allah gave them a big
    and fat sheep to slaughter instead. The sacrificing of a sheep has become a ritual for
    Muslims every year in remembrance of the obedience of Abraham and Ishmael, peace be upon
    them. Our celebration of this day and the slaughtering of the sheep are in compliance with
    the teachings of our Prophet Mohammad, praising and peace of Allah be upon him. Only
    Muslims celebrate these two days, while at the same time, Muslims do not celebrate the
    Christian holidays.
    As for the symbol, Muslims worship Allah (God), therefor they reject
    any kind of idol worshipping. We believe that Christians believe in the cross to be a
    symbol of their God, or the so claimed Son of God. They seek blessing and protection from
    this cross. Muslims seek protection and blessing only from Allah, that is why we do not
    have an Islamic symbol as the Christians cross. Some Muslims have invented the
    symbol of a crescent to counter the cross, but this is not authentic and it is considered
    as an innovation in Islam.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
4536,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4536,Is Intimacy an Act of Worship in Islam?,According to Hadith (by Muslim) there is reward for husband & wife's sexual intercourse. I heard that this reward is equivalent to the merit point of 70 Rak`ah of optional prayer. Is it true?,"Intercourse may be an act of worship if the intention behind it is to fulfill the rights of one's wife, to treat her kindly as enjoined by Allah, to seek a righteous child, to keep oneself or one’s wife chaste, to prevent both partners from looking towards or thinking of prohibited things, and other good intentions.","Is Intimacy an Act of Worship in Islam?


Is the reward of sex in Islam equivalent to 70 Sunnah prayers?","Praise be to Allah.Is Intimacy an Act of Worship in Islam?
 If a man has intercourse with his wife , he will be rewarded for that, because he is doing something permissible and avoiding something forbidden. This is what is stated in the Hadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him):
 It was narrated from Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) that some people from among the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “O Messenger of Allah, the rich people will get more reward. They pray as we pray, and they fast as we fast, but they give in charity from their excess wealth.” He said, “Has not Allah given you things with which you can give charity? Every Tasbihah (saying `Subhan Allah’ (Glory be to Allah)) is a charity. Every ‘Takbirah’ (saying `Allahu akbar (Allah is Most Great)) is a charity. Every ‘Tahmidah’ (saying `Al-hamdu-Lillah’ (praise be to Allah)) is a charity. Every Tahlilah (saying `La ilaha ill-Allah’ (there is none worthy of worship but Allah)) is a charity. Enjoining what is good is a charity. Forbidding what is evil is a charity. Having intercourse (with one’s wife) is a charity.” They said, “O Messenger of Allah, if one of us fulfils his desire, is there reward in that?” He said, “Do you not see that if he does it in a haram way he will have the burden of sin? So if he does it in a halal way, he will have a reward for that.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1674) 
Imam An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
“The phrase, `Having intercourse is a charity’ – the word bud’ (translated here as `having intercourse’ ) may mean intercourse, or it may refer to the private part itself…
This indicates that permissible actions may become acts of worship, if there is a sincere intention. Intercourse may be an act of worship if the intention behind it is to fulfil the rights of one's wife, to treat her kindly as enjoined by Allah, to seek a righteous child, to keep oneself or one’s wife chaste, to prevent both partners from looking towards or thinking of haram things, and other good intentions. `O Messenger of Allah, if one of us fulfils his desire, is there reward in that?’” (Sharh Muslim, 7/92)
Is the reward of sex in Islam equivalent to 70 Sunnah prayers?
 With regard to your comment that the reward of sex in Islam is equivalent to seventy optional prayers”
Perhaps this question about the reward for having intercourse with one’s wife comes from your reading of Imam An-Nawawi’s commentary on Sahih Muslim (Sharh An-Nawawi `ala Sahih Muslim). It is a comment which we will quote below, where the Shaykh (An-Nawawi – may Allah have mercy on him) was discussing the issue of enjoining what is good and saying that it is obligatory. Then he discussed the issue of saying Tasbih and Dhikr, which he noted is Sunnah. Then he explained that the obligatory act of worship is equivalent to seventy times the Sunnah act, and said: they reached this conclusion from a Hadith… Then at the end of this discussion he referred to the phrase “Having intercourse…” 
If this is indeed the case, then you should note that the first comment has nothing to do with what follows it. The phrase “from a Hadith” means from some Hadith, but Imam An-Nawawi does not quote it. When he finishes discussing the issue of obligatory and Sunnah acts of worship, and the status of each, he then starts his discussion of the phrase “Having intercourse...” So the confusion has arisen from this juxtaposition.
This is what we think. But if you mean that the reward for obligatory acts of worship is equivalent to the reward for seventy Sunnah acts, then An-Nawawi did discuss this point and said that there was a Hadith about it, but he did not quote it.
 We know what An-Nawawi was referring to, and this is what was pointed out by Al-Hafiz ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him).
 Al-Hafidh (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
 “Note:
In Ziyadat Ar-Rawdah, An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated from the Imam of the Haramayn from some of the scholars that the reward for an obligatory act of worship is seventy times more than the reward for a Sunnah act. An-Nawawi said: they reached this conclusion from a Hadith.”
 The Hadith in question was quoted by Imam An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) in An-Nihayah. It is the Marfu` Hadith of Salman concerning the month of Ramadan: “Whoever seeks to draw closer to Allah during (this month) by doing some good deeds will be like one who does an obligatory action at any other time, and one who does an obligatory action (during Ramadan) will be like one who does seventy obligatory actions at any other time.”
 This is an inauthentic Hadith which was narrated by Ibn Khuzaymah (may Allah have mercy on him), but he was uncertain as to whether it was sound or not.” ((At-Talkhis Al-Habir, 3/118)
 What he meant (may Allah have mercy on him) by saying that Ibn Khuzaymah was uncertain as to whether it was sound or not may be understood more clearly by referring to Sahih Ibn Khuzaymah (3/191), where he includes it under the chapter heading, Bab Fada’il Sharh Ramadan in Sahha Al-Khabr (Chapter on the virtues of the month of Ramadan, if the report is authentic).
 And the chain of transmission of this Hadith includes `Ali ibn Zayd ibn Jad`an, who is a weak narrator.

      deaf?2. are we allowed to claim compensation from the school through
      their insurance which should cover such accidents?jazakhallah khairan for your time, effort and truthful answears.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly, so long as the deaf person is
    responsible and of sound mind, he is obliged to do all the duties that he is able to
    fulfil.
With regard to the second question, we put this question to
    Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, may Allaah preserve him, who said:
How did she become deaf?
We said: through an accident that happened at school, such as
    a table or chair falling on her, which caused her to become deaf. The school considered
    itself to be responsible for that.
He replied: the responsible party is the one who caused the
    accident. If it happened that there is no one who can be held responsible, then it is not
    permissible for her to accept the compensation.
Question:
Suppose that the school or its administration was
    responsible, and it is a private school that is run for profit?
Answer:
The compensation is to be paid by the one who caused the
    accident. If someone moved the table or an electrical cable and it fell on this girl, then
    he is responsible and has to pay compensation.
Question:
If, according to the system in that country, the school is
    obliged to pay compensation, can these people take it as per the system?

      such as Muslim aid, but my parents are against this, as they would prefer the money to be
      given to relatives ( although my dad is already giving them money).Also as my parents
      would prefer me to keep the money within the family can i give charity without telling
      them, as one of the hadiths says that ""i and all my wealth belong to my father""?
      Another related question is that can my father pay zakat and the qurbani on my behalf as
      he is the head of the family? Jazakhallah Khairan",,,"Praise be to Allah.We put the following question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn
    Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen:
“I like to give my charity to charitable organizations but my
    father opposes this. He prefers to give it to relatives, and wants to make me do likewise.
    Does the hadeeth ‘You and your wealth belong to your father’ also mean that a
    father can control his son’s charitable giving?”
He answered, may Allaah preserve him:
“The hadeeth does not mean this, except if the father wants to
    take possession of the wealth himself, in which case there is nothing wrong (with him
    giving it as he sees fit), provided that this is not a trick to stop his son giving
    charity. But we nevertheless advise the son to give the charity to relatives, because this
    is preferable.”
The father does not have the right to oblige his son to give his
    charity to certain people and to prevent him from giving to others, but it is preferable
    for the son to respond to his father’s wishes, so long as he is advising him to do
    something good, which is upholding the ties of kinship by financial means. If the amount
    of money is large and there are people who need it more than the relatives, then he could
    give some of it to his relatives and some to others who are in need, or to Islamic
    charitable projects. With regard to the hadeeth, “You and your wealth belong to your
    father,” this was reported by Ibn Maajah (may Allaah have mercy on him) in his Sunan

Is not He (better than your gods) Who responds to the distressed one, when He calls Him, and Who removes the evil, generations after generations. Is there any god with Allaah? Little is it that you remember!
Is not He (better than your gods) Who guides you in the darkness of the land and the sea, and Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His mercy (rain)? Is there any god with Allaah? High Exalted be Allaah above all that they associate as partners (to Him)!
Is not He (better than your so-called gods) Who originates creation, and shall thereafter repeat it, and Who provides for you from heaven and earth? Is there any god with Allaah? Say: ‘bring forth your proofs, if you are truthful’

 Manner of greeting among Muslims 


Importance of salam in Islam


Reward for giving salam


Importance of returning salam","Praise be to Allah.Custom of greeting before Islam
All people have the custom of greeting one another, and every group has its own distinctive greeting that distinguishes them from other people.
The Arabs used to greet one another with the words An`im sabahan or An`imu sabahan [equivalent to Good morning, Translator], using words derived from al-ni`mah, which means good living after the morning. The idea was that because the morning is the first part of the day, if a person encounters something good in the morning, the rest of the day will be good too.
 Manner of greeting among Muslims 
When Islam came, Allah prescribed that the manner of greeting among Muslims should be Al-salamu ‘alaykum, and that this greeting should only be used among Muslims and not for other nations. 
The meaning of salam (literally, peace) is harmlessness, safety and protection from evil and from faults. 
The name al-Salam is a Name of Allah, may He be exalted, so the meaning of the greeting of salam which is required among Muslims is, May the blessing of His Name descend upon you. The usage of the preposition ‘ala in ‘alaykum (upon you) indicates that the greeting is inclusive.
Ibn al-Qayyim said in Badai' al-Fawaid (144):
“Allah, the Sovereign, the Most Holy, the Peace, prescribed that the greeting among the people of Islam should be al-salamu ‘alaykum, which is better than all the greetings of other nations which include impossible ideas or lies, such as saying, May you live for a thousand years, or things that are not accurate, such as An`im sabahan (Good morning), or actions that are not right, such as prostrating in greeting. Thus the greeting of salam is better than all of these, because it has the meaning of safety which is life, without which nothing else can be achieved. So this takes precedence over all other aims or objectives. A person has two main aims in life: to keep himself safe from evil, and to get something good. Keeping safe from evil takes precedence over getting something good.” 
Importance of salam in Islam
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) made spreading salam a part of faith. Al-Bukhari (12, 28 and 6236), Muslim (39), Ahmad (2/169), Abu Dawud (5494), al-Nasai, (8/107) and Ibn Hibban (505) narrated from ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar that a man asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): What is the best thing in Islam?, He said: Feeding others and giving the greeting of salam to those whom you know and those whom you do not know.
Ibn Hajar said in al-Fath (1/56):
“I.e., do not single out anybody out of arrogance or to impress them, but do it to honour the symbols of Islam and to foster Islamic brotherhood.”
Ibn Rajab said in al-Fath (1/43):
“The hadith makes the connection between feeding others and spreading salam because this combines good actions in both word and deed, which is perfect good treatment (ihsan). Indeed, this is the best thing that you can do in Islam after the obligatory duties.”
Al-Sanusi said in Ikmal al-Mu’allim (1/244):
“What is meant by salam is the greeting between people, which sows seeds of love and friendship in their hearts, as does giving food. There may be some weakness in the heart of one of them, which is dispelled when he is greeted, or there may be some hostility, which is turned to friendship by the greeting.”
Al-Qadi said in Ikmal al-Mu’allim (1:276):
“Here the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was urging the believers to soften their hearts. The best Islamic attitude is to love one another and greet one another, and this is achieved by words and deeds. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) urged the Muslims to foster love between one another by exchanging gifts and food, and by spreading salam , and he forbade the opposite, namely forsaking one another, turning away from one another, spying on one another, seeking out information about one another, stirring up trouble and being two faced.
Love is one of the duties of Islam and one of the pillars of the Islamic system. One should give salams to those whom one knows and those whom one does not know, out of sincerity towards Allah; one should not try to impress other people by giving salams only to those whom one knows and no-one else. This also entails an attitude of humility and spreading the symbols of this ummah through the word of salam.
Thus the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained that this salam spreads love and brotherhood. Muslim (54), Ahmad (2/391), and al-Tirmidhi (2513) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:
“You will not enter Paradise until you believe, and you will not believe until you love one another. Shall I not tell you about something which, if you do it, you will love one another? Spread salam amongst yourselves.”
Al-Qadi ‘Iyad said in al-Ikmal (1/304):
“This is urging us to spread salam, as mentioned above, among those whom we know and those whom we do not know. Salam is the first level of righteousness and the first quality of brotherhood, and it is the key to creating love. By spreading salam the Muslims’ love for one another grows stronger and they demonstrate their distinctive symbols and spread a feeling of security amongst themselves. This is the meaning of Islam.
Reward for giving salam
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) also explained the reward earned by the one who says salam, as was reported by al-Nasai in ‘Amal al-yawm wal-laylah (368) and al-Bukhari in al-Adab al-Mufrad (586) and by Ibn Hibban (493). They reported from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that a man passed by the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) whilst he was sitting with some others, and said Salam ‘alaykum (peace be upon you). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, [He will have] ten hasanat (rewards). Another man passed by and said Salam ‘alaykum wa rahmat-Allah (peace be upon you and the mercy of Allah). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, [He will have] twenty hasanat. Another man passed by and said Salam ‘alaykum wa rahmat-Allahi wa barakatuhu (peace be upon you and the mercy of Allah and His blessings). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, [He will have] thirty hasanat.
Importance of returning salam
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded us to return salams , and made it a right and a duty. Ahmad (2/540), al-Bukhari (1240), Muslim (2792), al-Nsai in al-Yawm wal-Laylah (221) and Abu Dawud (5031) all reported that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: The Muslim has five rights over his fellow-Muslim: he should return his salams, visit him when he is sick, attend his funeral, accept his invitation, and pray for mercy for him [say Yarhamuk Allah] when he sneezes.
It is clear that it is obligatory to return salams, because by doing so a Muslim is giving you safety and you have to give him safety in return. It is as if he is saying to you, I am giving you safety and security, so you have to give him the same, so that he does not get suspicious or think that the one to whom he has given salam is betraying him or ignoring him. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told us that if Muslims are ignoring or forsaking one another, this will be put to an end when one of them gives salam. Al-Bukhari (6233) reported that Abu Ayyub (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: It is not permissible for a Muslim to forsake his brother for more than three days, each of them turning away from the other if they meet. The better of them is the first one to say salam.
