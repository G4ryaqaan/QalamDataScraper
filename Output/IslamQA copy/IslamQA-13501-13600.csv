13501,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13501,"An invalid marriage contract must be done again, even if ten years have passed","My question is that we know that a girl’s marriage without the consent of the guardian is invalid according to the shareeah. Then there are a lot of cases where the couple have eloped and got married. My question is, if the marriage is invalid, how do these people make it valid, lets say after 5 years of marriage or 10years of marriage and they have children now.
My other question is that if a couple runs away and gets married and then after certain period, lets say 2years or 4years the parents then give consent or come to acceptance of their marriage, then is the marriage valid.
How do some one make this marriage valid?",,,"Praise be to Allah.If a woman gets married without the consent of her wali (guardian), her marriage is invalid and is not valid even if ten years have passed and even if they have children. It is essential to repeat the marriage contract after her guardian’s approval is obtained, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no valid marriage without a wali and two witnesses.” (Narrated by Ahmad and the authors of Sunan except al-Nasaa’i. See Saheeh al-Jaami’, 7558).
 There is a stern warning against a woman who arranges her own marriage. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “A woman should not arrange another woman’s marriage and a woman should not arrange her own marriage, for the zaaniyah (adulteress) is the one who arranges her own marriage.” (Narrated by Ibn Maajah, 1782; see also Saheeh al-Jaami’, 7298).
 With regard to the second question, which has to do with the approval of the wali; in this case it is essential to repeat the marriage contract, because the first nikaah was not valid. The couple must also repent sincerely to Allah for what they have done, and Allah is Forgiving, Most Merciful.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

13503,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13503,Taking from one who deals in haraam things,"Is it permissible for me to take from a man who deals in riba (usury, interest)?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    This is a matter concerning which the salaf differed. Some of 
    them allowed that, and some of them did not allow it. Some of the scholars 
    differentiated between a person whose wealth is mostly haraam, and said that 
    it is either obligatory or mustahabb to avoid him, and one whose wealth is 
    mostly halaal, in which case it is permissible to deal with him and eat from 
    his food. 

    For more details on this matter, please see Jaami’ 
    al-‘Uloom wa’l-Hukam by Ibn Rajab, commentary on hadeeth no. 6. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen 
    (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: Is it permissible to accept gifts 
    form a man who deals in riba? 

    He said: 

    The basic principle is that what is haraam because of the 
    way in which it is acquired is haraam for the one who acquires it, but not 
    for one who takes it from him in a permissible manner. 
    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) accepted gifts 
    from the Jews, as when a Jewish woman gave him a sheep in Khaybar. He also 
    dealt with them; when he died his shield was in pledge to a Jew. He did this 
    even though they dealt in riba, as Allaah tells us about them 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “For the wrongdoing of the Jews, We made unlawful for them 
    certain good foods which had been lawful for them — and for their hindering 
    many from Allaah’s Way; 
161. And their taking of 
    Ribaa (usury) though they were forbidden from taking it and their devouring 
    of men’s substance wrongfully (bribery). And We have prepared for the 
    disbelievers among them a painful torment”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:160-161]

    Based on this, it is permissible to accept a gift from one 
    who deals in riba, and it is also permissible to buy from him and sell to 
    him, unless there is some interest to be served by shunning him, in which 
    case we should refrain from doing so because of that interest. 

    With regard to that which is haraam in and of itself, it is 
    haraam for the one who takes it and for others. 

    For example, if I were to be given a gift of some wine by a 
    Jew or a Christian – who believes that wine is permissible – it is not 
    permissible for me to accept it, because it is haraam in and of itself. 

    Similarly, if a person were to steal some money and give some 
    to another person, it is not permissible to accept it, because this money is 
    haraam in and of itself (by virtue of it having been stolen).

13506,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13506,Conditions of Accepting Du`a,What are the conditions of Du`a so that the Du`a will be answered and accepted by Allah?,"Conditions of accepting Du`a are:
•	You should call upon no one except Allah.
•	You should seek to draw close to Allah in one of the ways that are prescribed in Shari`ah. 
•	You should avoid seeking a quick response.
•	The Du`a should not involve sin or severing of the ties of kinship.
•	You should think positively of Allah.
•	You should be focused, aware of the greatness of the One upon Whom you are calling.
•	Ensuring that one’s food comes from permissible sources.
•	You should avoid aggression in Du`a.
•	You should not let Du`a distract you from an obligatory duty.",,"Praise be to Allah.To have your supplications ( Du`a ) accepted, certain conditions need to be met; you should:

Call upon no one except Allah . The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If you ask, then ask of Allah (only), and if you seek help, then seek the help of Allah.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 2516; classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sahih Al-Jami’). 

This is what is meant by the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And the mosques are for Allah (Alone), so invoke not anyone along with Allah.” [Al-Jinn 72:18]
This is the most important condition of Du`a, without which no Du`a will be accepted and no good deed taken up. There are some people who ask (i.e., supplicate) the dead and regard them as intermediaries between them and Allah. They claim that these righteous people will bring them closer to Allah and intercede for them with Him, and they claim that their sins are so great that they have no status before Allah, and that is why they set up these intermediaries and pray to them instead of Allah. However, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And when My slaves ask you (O Muhammad) concerning Me - indeed I am near (to them by My Knowledge). I respond to the invocations of the supplicant when he calls on Me (without any mediator or intercessor).” [Al-Baqarah 2:186] 

Seek to draw close to Allah through one of the ways that are prescribed in Shari`ah. 


Avoid seeking a quick response , for this is one of the problems that may prevent the Du`a from being accepted. A Hadith states: “One of you may be answered so long as he is not hasty and says, ‘I said Du`a but I got no response.’” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 6340; Muslim, 2735) 

In Sahih Muslim (2736) it says: “A man’s (Du`a) may be answered so long as it does not involve sin, severing the ties of kinship, or hastening.” It was said: “O Messenger of Allah, what does hastening mean?” He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When he says, ‘I made Du`a and I made Du`a but I did not see any response,’ so he gets discouraged and stops making Du`a.” 

Your Du`a should not involve sin or severing of the ties of kinship , as stated in the Hadith quoted above: “A man’s (Du`as) may be answered so long as he does not involve sin or severing the ties of kinship …” 


Think positively of Allah . The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah, may He be exalted, says: ‘I am as My slave thinks I am.’” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 7405; Muslim, 4675). According to the Hadith of Abu Hurayrah: “Make Du`a to Allah with unwavering certainty of (His) response.” (Narrated by Al-Tirmidhi; classed as sound by Al-Albani in Sahih Al-Jami’, 245).If you think well of your Lord (i.e., expects the best from Him), Allah will bestow His bounty upon you and give you in abundance.  


Be focused and mindful of the greatness of the One upon Whom you are calling. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Know that Allah does not answer a Du`a from a distracted heart.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 3479; classed as sound by Al-Albani in Saheeh Al-Jami’, 245) 


Ensure that your food comes from lawful sources. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“Verily, Allah accepts only from the pious”[Al-Ma’idah 5:27]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stated that a response was unlikely for one who obtains his food, drinks and clothing from prohibited sources. In the Hadith it says: [The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)] mentioned the man who undertakes a lengthy journey and is dishevelled and covered with dust, and he stretches his hands towards heaven saying, ‘O Lord, O Lord,’ when his food is unlawful (bought with ill-gotten money), his drink is unlawful, his clothes are unlawful. He was nourished with what is unlawful, so how can he be granted a response?] (Narrated by Muslim, 1015) 
Ibn Al-Qayyim said: “Thus eating from ill-gotten sources saps the strength of the Du`a and weakens it.” 

Avoid aggression in Du`a , for Allah does not like aggression in Du`a. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Invoke your Lord with humility and in secret. He likes not the aggressors.” [Al-A’raf 7:55]


Do not let Du`a distract you from an obligatory duty such as an obligatory prayer that is now due, and you should not neglect parents’ rights on the basis of Du`a. This is indicated by the story of Jurayj, when he did not answer his mother’s call and turned instead to his prayer. She prayed against him and Allah tested him sorely. 

Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The scholars said: This indicates that what he should have done is to answer her, because he was offering a supererogatory prayer, continuation of which was voluntary, not obligatory, whereas answering his mother and honouring her was obligatory and disobeying her was prohibited.” (Sahih Muslim bi Sharh Al-Nawawi, 16/82)

13518,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13518,Younger brother getting married before older brother,I am a young man aged 21 years. I want to get married but I have two older brothers who have not got married yet. Is it permissible for me to get married before them?,,,"Praise be to Allah.This question was put to 
          Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him), who said:  
          
I say to the brother who 
          is asking the question, you are not too young to get married. ‘Amr ibn 
          al-‘Aas got married when he was 11 years old, and he had a child. Hence 
          it was said that that there was only thirteen years between him and 
          his son ‘Abd-Allaah.  
I say to the brother who 
          is asking the question, put your trust in Allaah and get married, and 
          when it is easy for your two older brothers to get married they will 
          get married too.  
This is one of the grievous 
          mistakes that some people make, when they do not let the younger daughter 
          marry so longer as there is an older sibling. This is a shame.  
          
If someone whose character and religious 
          commitment are suitable proposes marriage to her, then they should let 
          her get married to him. Maybe there is something preventing the older 
          sister from getting married. Often what happens is that it is decreed 
          that the younger sister will marry first, so if the younger sister is 
          not allowed to marry first, the older sister is prevented from marrying. 
          Then when the younger sister gets married, Allaah opens the door for 
          the older sister (to get married). This is something which is well known 
          from experience, i.e., that not letting one daughter get married may 
          prevent another from getting married. The same may apply to having children. 
          We have heard more than one story of a man who gets married and remains 
          childless for fifteen years, then he takes a second wife and the second 
          wife gets pregnant from the first night of marriage, and then the first 
          wife get pregnant at the same time.  
So we say to the one who 
          is asking: get married and do not think that this means you are disobeying 
          your parents or severing your ties of kinship with your brothers.","Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen From the tape al-Liqaa’ al-Shahriyyah, 15"
13521,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13521,Should he tell a non-Muslim all the details of Islam?,is it o.k for a muslim boy to tell someone from another religion what islam is all about?,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Yes, it is right to tell him what Islam means, but it is not 
    wise to tell him all the details of Islam in one go. Hence the daa’iyah has 
    to exercise wisdom and start with the most important things and understand 
    the priorities of da’wah. It was narrated in the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas (may 
    Allaah be pleased with him) that when the Messenger of Allaah  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sent Mu’aadh (may Allaah be pleased 
    with him) to Yemen, he said: “You are going to some of the People of the 
    Book, so let the first thing to which you call them be the worship of Allaah 
    alone. Then when they have learned about Allaah, tell them that Allaah has 
    enjoined upon them five prayers each day and night. After they do that, then 
    tell them that Allaah has enjoined upon them the zakaat to be paid from 
    their wealth and given to the poor. If they obey, then take that from them, 
    but leave the best of their wealth.” 

    (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1458; Muslim, 19) 

    The Muslim is obliged to call others to Islam, on condition 
    that he knows what he is calling them to, so that he will not make mistakes 
    in his da’wah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Say (O Muhammad): ‘This is my way; I invite unto Allaah 
    (i.e. to the Oneness of Allaah — Islamic Monotheism) with sure knowledge, I 
    and whosoever follows me (also must invite others to Allaah, i.e. to the 
    Oneness of Allaah — Islamic Monotheism with sure knowledge). And Glorified 
    and Exalted be Allaah (above all that they associate as partners with Him). 
    And I am not of the Mushrikoon (polytheists, pagans, idolaters and 
    disbelievers in the Oneness of Allaah; those who worship others along with 
    Allaah or set up rivals or partners to Allaah)’”

    [Yoosuf 12:108]
Baseerah (translated here 
    as “sure knowledge”) means the knowledge with which truth may be 
    distinguished from falsehood.” 

    (From Tafseer al-Baghawi, 4/284). 

    Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his 
    Tafseer (4/422) in his commentary on this aayah: “Allaah is telling His 
    slave and Messenger to the two races of mankind and the jinn to tell the 
    people that this is his way and his path, which is calling them to bear 
    witness that there is no god except Allaah alone, with no partner or 
    associate, calling them to Allaah in this way with sure knowledge, certain 
    faith and shar’i and rational proof.” 

    You should note that calling people to Islam is obligatory. 
    Our scholars (may Allaah have mercy on them) said: “It is obligatory upon 
    every Muslim and Muslimah to know four things and act upon them: 

    1 – Knowledge, which means that the slave knows his Lord and 
    his Prophet, and knows the religion of Islam based on evidence.

    2 – Acting upon it, which means that he should act upon this 
    knowledge.

    3 – Calling others to it, i.e., calling them to what he has 
    learned.

    4 – Patiently bearing any difficulties encountered as a 
    result of seeking knowledge, acting upon it and calling others to what he 
    has learned. 

    The evidence for these four things is the verse in which 
    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “By Al-‘Asr (the time).

    Verily, man is in loss,

    Except those who believe (in Islamic Monotheism) and do 
    righteous good deeds, and recommend one another to the truth [i.e. order one 
    another to perform all kinds of good deeds (Al-Ma‘roof) which Allaah has 
    ordained, and abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds (Al-Munkar) 
    which Allaah has forbidden], and recommend one another to patience (for the 
    sufferings, harms, and injuries which one may encounter in Allaah’s Cause 
    during preaching His religion of Islamic Monotheism or Jihad)”

    [al-‘Asr 103:1-3]

    The phrase “Except those who believe” refers to the 
    first issue, because there is no faith or belief without knowledge. The 
    phrase “and do righteous good deeds” refers to the second issue. The 
    phrase “and recommend one another to the truth” refers to the third 
    issue, which is da’wah. And the phrase “and recommend one another to 
    patience” refers to the fourth issue. 

    So you should explain to the non-Muslim what the religion of 
    Islam means, namely submission to Allaah, accepting His commands, and 
    believing in His Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
    You should tell him about the beauties of Islam (see question no. 219) so 
    that he will be convinced of Islam and will accept it. If he becomes Muslim, 
    then tell him about the rulings of Islam in detail, explaining it to him 
    gradually, according to his level of understanding. Do not discuss with him 
    things that may cause him to doubt or overwhelm him with too much 
    information. But follow the method of the rabbaaniyeen of whom Allaah 
    says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Be you Rabbaaniyyoon (learned men of religion who 
    practise what they know and also preach others), because you are teaching 
    the Book, and you are studying it”

    [Aal ‘Imraan 3:79]
It was said that the 
    rabbaaniyyoon are those who teach people by starting with easy and 
    straightforward issues before they present them with complicated issues.

          question caught our attention, because it indicates that you have an 
          interest in the religion of Islam and in the Prophet of Islam. We congratulate 
          you for this interest and your keenness to find out about these things 
          from trustworthy sources.  Perhaps this question will open the 
          way for you to reach the path of truth, for Allaah is the Guide to the 
          Straight Path. Here is the answer :  
Muhammad 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is the Prophet whom Allaah 
          sent to all of mankind, to bring them forth from the darkness of polytheism 
          and disbelief to the light of guidance and Islam. Allaah commanded him 
          to call people to worship Allaah alone, with no partner or associate, 
          and to enjoin good characteristics upon them, such as generosity, courage, 
          honouring one’s guest, treating neighbours kindly, obeying one’s parents, 
          respecting the old and being compassionate towards the young, guiding 
          those who are misguided, showing mercy to the poor and needy, helping 
          those who are in need, helping those who are troubled, relieving those 
          who are in distress, and other kinds of good characteristics… and to 
          forbid polytheism, disbelief and evil characteristics and actions such 
          as adultery, lying, treachery, deceit, disobedience to parents, wrongdoing, 
          etc. See question # 219. 
 With 
          regard to the pillars of Islam, it should be noted – may Allaah guide 
          you – that the Messenger 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was commanded to convey 
          that which Allaah revealed to him, without adding anything or taking 
          anything away. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“It is only a Revelation revealed”
[al-Najm 
          53:4].  
It 
          is impossible for the Messenger 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to tell lies about Allaah. 
          Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  
“And 
          if he (Muhammad) had forged a false saying concerning Us (Allaah), 
We 
          surely would have seized him by his right hand (or with power and might), 
          
And 
          then We certainly would have cut off his life artery (aorta), 
And 
          none of you could have withheld Us from (punishing) him” 
[al-Haaqqah 
          :44-47]  
If 
          we examine the five pillars of Islam, we will see that they vary. The 
          first pillar – the Shahaadatayn or twin testimony of faith – 
          combines action of the heart (belief) with action of the tongue (words). 
          The second pillar – prayer – means doing a physical action which connects 
          a person to his Lord at various times of the night and day. The third 
          pillar, fasting, is an act of worship which involves refraining from 
          food, drink, intercourse and all actions that break the fast, from dawn 
          till sunset. So the Muslim fasts to worship Allaah, and also to feel 
          how his poor brothers feel. The fourth pillar is zakaah, which is a 
          financial action, whereby the Muslim who is able to do so gives part 
          of his wealth to his poor and needy brothers. The fifth pillar is Hajj 
          (pilgrimage), which is an action that combines spending money and physical 
          effort. If you think about these five pillars, you will see great wisdom 
          behind them. Islam is based on submission to Allaah alone, and giving 
          up associating anything or anyone else with Him. It also teaches that 
          Allaah should not be worshipped in any way other than the ways that 
          He has prescribed. There are some people for whom it is easy to do physical 
          actions but it is hard for them to spend money, so zakaah is a test 
          for such people. Some people find it easy to spend a lot of money but 
          it is difficult for them to make physical efforts,  so prayer is 
          a test for them. Some people find it easy to pray and pay zakaah, but 
          it is hard for them to give up the food, drink and physical pleasures 
          that they enjoy, so fasting is a test for them. And Hajj may combine 
          spending money with physical effort… and other praiseworthy reasons 
          behind these acts of worship.

          pillars were revealed from Allaah, and conveyed to us by the trustworthy 
          Prophet

“Had there been therein (in the heavens and the earth) aalihah (gods) besides Allaah, then verily, both would have been ruined. Glorified be Allaah, the Lord of the Throne, (High is He) above all that (evil) they associate with Him!”[al-Anbiya’ 21:22 – interpretation of the meaning] 
These great created things either created themselves – which is impossible – or man created himself then created them – which is also impossible: 
“Were they created by nothing? Or were they themselves the creators?
Or did they create the heavens and the earth? Nay, but they have no firm Belief”[al-Toor 52:35-36 – interpretation of the meaning]
 Reason, Revelation and the original state of man (fitrah) all indicate that this universe has One Who brought it into being, that these created things have a Creator Who is Ever-Living and Eternal, All-Knowing and All-Aware, Powerful and Almighty, Kind and Most Merciful. He has the Most Beautiful Names and Sublime Attributes and He knows all things. Nothing is beyond His control, and there is nothing like unto Him: 
“And your Ilaah (God) is One Ilaah (God — Allaah), Laa ilaaha illa Huwa (there is none who has the right to be worshipped but He), the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
[al-Baqarah 2:163 – interpretation of the meaning] 
The existence of Allaah is something that is there is no excuse for not knowing. It is the matter of common sense: 
“Their Messengers said: What! Can there be a doubt about Allaah, the Creator of the heavens and the earth?”
[Ibraaheem 14:10 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Allaah has created people with the natural instinct (fitrah) to affirm His Lordship and Oneness, but the shayaateen (devils) came to the sons of Adam and caused them to deviate from their religion. According to a hadeeth qudsi (a type of prophetic narration), “I created all My slaves as haneefs (monotheists), but the shayaateen (devils) came to them and made them deviate from their religion, and they forbade them that which I had permitted to them.” (Narrated by Muslim, no. 2865) 
Among them are those who deny the existence of Allaah, and those who worship the Shaytaan, and those who worship man. And there are those who worship the dinar [money], or fire, or genital organs, or animals. And there are some who associate in worship with Him a stone from the earth or a star in the sky. 
These things which are worshipped instead of Allaah, cannot create or provide; they cannot hear or see, or bring benefits or cause harm. So how can they worship them instead of Allaah? 
“Are many different lords (gods) better or Allaah, the One, the Irresistible?”[Yoosuf 12:39 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Allaah has condemned those who worship these idols which cannot hear, see or think: 
“Verily, those whom you call upon besides Allaah are slaves like you. So call upon them and let them answer you if you are truthful.
Have they feet wherewith they walk? Or have they hands wherewith they hold? Or have they eyes wherewith they see? Or have they ears wherewith they hear?”
[al-A’raaf 7:194-195 – interpretation of the meaning] 
“Say (O Muhammad to mankind): ‘How do you worship besides Allaah something which has no power either to harm or benefit you? But it is Allaah Who is the All‑Hearer, All‑Knower”
[al-Maa'idah 5:76 – interpretation of the meaning] 
How ignorant man is of his Lord Who created him and provides for him. How he rejects Him and forgets Him, and worships others instead of Him: 
“Verily, it is not the eyes that grow blind, but it is the hearts which are in the breasts that grow blind”
[al-Hajj 22:46 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Glorified be Allaah far above that which they associate with Him. Praise be to Allaah the Lord of the Worlds: 
“Say (O Muhammad): Praise and thanks be to Allaah, and peace be on His slaves whom He has chosen (for His Message)! Is Allaah better, or (all) that you ascribe as partners (to Him)?” (Of course, Allaah is Better).
Is not He (better than your gods) Who created the heavens and the earth, and sends down for you water (rain) from the sky, whereby We cause to grow wonderful gardens full of beauty and delight? It is not in your ability to cause the growth of their trees. Is there any ilaah (god) with Allaah? Nay, but they are a people who ascribe equals (to Him)!
Is not He (better than your gods) Who has made the earth as a fixed abode, and has placed rivers in its midst, and has placed firm mountains therein, and has set a barrier between the two seas (of salt and sweet water)? Is there any ilaah (god) with Allaah? Nay, but most of them know not!
Is not He (better than your gods) Who responds to the distressed one, when he calls on Him, and Who removes the evil, and makes you inheritors of the earth, generations after generations? Is there any ilaah (god) with Allaah? Little is that you remember!
Is not He (better than your gods) Who guides you in the darkness of the land and the sea, and Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His Mercy (rain)? Is there any ilaah (god) with Allaah? High Exalted be Allaah above all that they associate as partners (to Him)!
Is not He (better than your so‑called gods) Who originates creation, and shall thereafter repeat it, and Who provides for you from heaven and earth? Is there any ilaah (god) with Allaah? Say: ‘Bring forth your proofs, if you are truthful’”

If the person has died and the soul has departed, then his relatives have to do the following: 

Close his eyes
Make du`a for him 

Umm Salamah said: 
""The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came to see Abu Salamah when his sight had become fixed (he had passed away). So the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) closed his eyes and said: 'When the soul is seized and it leaves the body, the eyes follow it.' Some of Abu Salamah's family wept and wailed, whereupon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: 'Pray to Allah only for good for yourselves, because the angels (who are present) say ""amin"" to whatever you utter.' Then he said: 'O Allah! Forgive Abu Salamah; raise his station among those who are rightly-guided; and take good care of his family that he has left behind. O Lord of the Worlds! Forgive him and us, make his grave spacious, and put light therein for him.""  (Narrated by Muslim, Ahmad, al-Bayhaqi and others)  

They should cover him with a cloth that will cover all of his body. 

This is because of the hadith of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her), according to which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was shrouded in a striped cloak. (Narrated by the two Shaykhs (al-Bukhari and Muslim) in their Sahihs, by al-Bayhaqi and others). 

This applies in the case of one who does not die in a state of ihram; the person who dies in ihram should not have his head or face covered. 

This is because of the hadith of Ibn `Abbas who said: “Whilst a man was standing at ‘Arafah, he fell from his mount and broke his neck (or he said, he died). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Wash him with water and lote leaves, and shroud him in two cloths”  (according to another report, “… in his two cloths [which he was wearing for ihram]”)  “… and do not perfume his body, and do not cover his head [or his face], for he will be resurrected on the Day of Resurrection reciting the Talbiyah.” (Narrated by the two Shaykhs (al-Bukhari and Muslim) in their Sahihs, and by Abu Na’im in al-Mustakhraj, and by al-Bayhaqi. The additional material was not narrated by al-Bukhari) 

They should hasten to prepare him for burial and take him out, if it is obvious that he is dead  

This is because of the hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) which he attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): ‘Hasten to bury the deceased , for if he was righteous, then you are taking him to something good, and if he was otherwise, then it is an evil of which you are relieving yourselves.” (Narrated by the two Shaykhs (al-Bukhari and Muslim) – this version was narrated by Muslim, and the authors of the four Sunans. It was classed as sahih by al-Tirmidhi, Ahmad and al-Bayhaqi from Abu Hurayrah) 

They should bury him in the city or country where he died, and not move him elsewhere, because that would contradict the haste in burying that is enjoined in Islam. 

Hence when a brother of `Aishah died in Wadi al-Habashah, and he was moved from the place where he had died, she said, “The only thing that upset me (or grieved me) was that I wished that he had been buried in the place where he died.” (Narrated by al-Bayhaqi with an authentic isnad) 
Al-Nawawi said in al-Adhkar: 
“If he (the dying person) leaves instructions that he be moved to another land [for burial], those instructions should not be carried out, because moving the deceased [to another land for burial] is haram according to the correct view of the majority, and was clearly stated by those who examined the matter in depth.” 

Some of them should hasten to pay off his debts from his money, even if that means paying all that is left. If he did not have any wealth, then the state should pay on his behalf, if he had tried his best to pay off his debts. If the state does not do that, and some people volunteer to do that, then that is OK. 

Sa’d ibn al-Atwal (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that his brother died, leaving three hundred dirhams, and leaving dependents. He said, “I wanted to spend it on his dependents, but the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ‘Your brother is being detained by his debt, so go and pay it off for him.’ So I went and paid it off, then I came and said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, I have paid it off, except for two dirhams which a woman claimed (were owed to her), but she had no proof.’ He said, ‘Give them to her, because that is her due (or, because she is speaking the truth).’”  (Narrated by Ibn Majah, Ahmad and al-Bayhaqi. One of its chains of narration is sound and the other is like the isnad of Ibn Majah. Al-Busayri classed it as sahih in al-Zawaid). 
Samurah ibn Jundub narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed the funeral prayer (according to one report, he prayed the Fajr prayer), and “when he had finished he said, ‘Is there anybody here from the family of So and So?’ The people remained silent, because whenever he brought anything up, they would keep quiet at first. He said that three times, and no one answered. Then a man said, ‘Here he is.’ A man stood up and came, dragging his lower garment, from the back of the assembly. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ‘What kept you from answering me the first two times? I did not mention your name except for a good reason. So-and-So – a man from amongst them – is being kept by his debt from Paradise. If you wish, you may ransom him, or if you wish, you may leave him to the punishment of Allah.’ If only you had seen his family and those who knew of his affairs getting up and praying off his debts, until there was no one left who could make any demands from him.’” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, al-Nasai, al-Hakim, al-Bayhaqi, al-Tayalisi in his Musnad and Ahmad. Some of them narrated from al-Shu’bi from Samurah, and some mentioned Sam’an ibn Mushannij in between them. The former is sahih according to the conditions of the two Shaykhs [al-Bukhari and Muslim], as al-Hakim said, and al-Dhahabi agreed with him; the latter is sahih only) 
We ask Allah to forgive the believing men and women. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.

13563,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13563,What is the meaning of the word muhsanaat in the Qur’aan?,What is the meaning of the word muhsanaat in the Qur’aan?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Al-Shanqeeti said: 
The word muhsanaat is used in three senses in the Qur’aan: 
(1)Muhsanaat meaning chaste women. For example, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“they (the above said slave-girls) should be chaste [muhsanaat], not committing illegal sex, nor taking boyfriends”
[al-Nisaa’ 4:25]
i.e., they should be chaste, not committing zina (fornication or adultery).
(2)muhsanaat meaning free. For example, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“if they commit illegal sexual intercourse, their punishment is half of that for free[muhsanaat]  (unmarried) women”
[al-Nisaa’ 4:25]
(3)the word ihsaan (from which the word muhsanaat is derived) may also mean marriage. For example the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And after they have been taken in wedlock [uhsinna], if they commit illegal sexual intercourse…”[al-Nisaa’ 4:25]
meaning ,when they have gotten married. The view of some scholars, that the meaning of ihsaan in the phrase “uhsinna” is Islam goes against the apparent meaning of the context of the aayah, because the context of the aayah is speaking about believing girls, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And whoever of you have not the means wherewith to wed free believing women…”[al-Nisaa’ 4:25]
Ibn Katheer said in his commentary on this aayah: 
The most apparent meaning – and Allaah knows best – is that what is meant by ihsaan here is marriage, because the context of the aayah indicates that, when Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And whoever of you have not the means wherewith to wed free believing women, they may wed believing girls from among those (slaves) whom your right hands possess…”[al-Nisaa’ 4:25]
The context of the aayah speaks of believing (slave) girls. Therefore the meaning of the phrase “uhsinna” means marriage, as it was interpreted by Ibn ‘Abbaas and others.","Adwaa’ al-Bayaan, 1/279, 280"

Why do Muslims go for Hajj?


What are the conditions of Hajj?","Praise be to Allah.Islam is about beliefs and laws
Islam is based on five pillars which the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has explained for us. The Prophet  said: “Islam is built upon five [pillars]: the testimony that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; establishing regular prayer (salah); paying the zakah; Hajj (pilgrimage) and fasting Ramadan.” (Agreed upon; narrated by al-Bukhaari, no. 8) 
Islam is both belief and laws, in which Allah and His Messenger have told us what is halal and what is haram, morals and good manners, acts of worship and how to interact with people, rights and duties, and scenes of the resurrection. When Allah completed this religion, He chose it to be the way of life for all of mankind until the Hour begins: 
“This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion.” [al-Maidah 5:3 – interpretation of the meaning] 
What are the 5 pillars of Islam?
These are the pillars of Islam and the principles upon which it is based: 
The first pillar of Islam: al-Shahadatayn (the twin testimony of faith) 
This means that a person believes that Allah alone is the Lord, Sovereign and Controller, the Creator and Provider. He affirms all His most beautiful names and the sublime attributes that Allah has affirmed for Himself or that His Prophet affirmed for Him. He believes that Allah alone, and no one else, is the Only One Who is deserving of worship, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“He is the Originator of the heavens and the earth. How can He have children when He has no wife? He created all things and He is the All-Knower of everything.
Such is Allah, your Lord! La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the Creator of all things. So worship Him (Alone), and He is the Wakeel (Trustee, Disposer of affairs or Guardian) over all things.” [al-An'am 6:101-102] 
And he believes that Allah sent His Messenger Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and revealed to him the Quran, and commanded him to convey this religion to all of mankind. He believes that loving Allah and His Messenger and obeying them are duties which are obligatory upon all of mankind, and that love of Allah can only be realized by following His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): 
“Say (O Muhammad to mankind): ‘If you (really) love Allah, then follow me (i.e. accept Islamic Monotheism, follow the Quran and the Sunnah), Allah will love you and forgive you your sins. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [Al ‘Imran 3:31 – interpretation of the meaning] 
The second pillar of Islam: salah (prayer) 
The Muslim believes that Allah has enjoined upon every sane adult Muslim five (formal) prayers each day and night, which he does in a state of purity, standing before his Lord, every day in a state of purity and humility, thanking his Lord for His blessings, asking Him of His bounty, seeking His forgiveness for his sins, asking Him for Paradise and seeking refuge in Him from Hell. 
What are the five daily prayers in Islam?
The five obligatory prayers which are required day and night are Fajr (early morning, before dawn), Zuhr (mid-day, just after noon), ‘Asr (mid afternoon), Maghrib (just after sunset) and ‘Isha (at night, after dark has fallen). There are also Sunnah prayers such as Qiyam al-Layl (prayer at night), Tarawih prayers, two rak’ahs of Duha prayer, etc. 
What are the benefits of prayer in Islam?
Prayer, whether it is fard or nafl, represents a sincere turning towards Allah alone in all one's affairs. Allah has commanded all the believers to guard strictly the observance of the prayers, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Guard strictly (five obligatory) As-Salawat (the prayers) especially the middle Salah (i.e. the best prayer - ‘Asr). And stand before Allah with obedience [and do not speak to others during the Salah (prayers)].” [al-Baqarah 2:238] 
The five daily prayers are obligatory upon every Muslim man and woman, night and day: 
“Verily, As-Salah (the prayer) is enjoined on the believers at fixed hours.” [al-Nisa 4:103 – interpretation of the meaning] 
The one who abandons prayer has no share in Islam. Whoever neglects it deliberately is a kafir, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“(And remain always) turning in repentance to Him (only), and be afraid and dutiful to Him; and perform As-Salah (Iqamat-as-Salat) and be not of Al-Mushrikin (the polytheists, idolaters, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah).” [al-Rum 30:31] 
Islam is based on co-operation, brotherhood and love, and Allah has prescribed coming together for these prayers and others, in order to attain these virtues. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Prayer in congregation is twenty-seven times better than prayer offered alone.” (Narrated by Muslim, no. 650) 
Prayer helps the believer at times of hardship and calamity. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And seek help in patience and As-Salah (the prayer) and truly, it is extremely heavy and hard except for Al-Khashi‘un [i.e. the true believers in Allah — those who obey Allah with full submission, fear much from His punishment, and believe in His Promise (Paradise) and in His Warnings (Hell)].” [al-Baqarah 2:45] 
The five daily prayers wipe out sins, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do you not think that if there was a river at the door of any one of you, and he were to bathe in it five times each day, would there by any dirt left on him?” They said, “No dirt would be left on him at all.” He said, “That is the likeness of the five daily prayers, by means of which Allah erases sin.” 
Prayer in the mosque is a means of entering Paradise. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever comes and goes to the mosque, Allah will prepare for him a house in Paradise for each time he comes and goes.” (Narrated by Muslim, no. 669) 
Prayer brings the slave and his Creator together. It was the delight of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Whenever any matter grieved him, he would turn to prayer and converse with his Lord and call upon Him, seeking His forgiveness and asking Him of His bounty. 
Prayer done with proper humility and fear of Allah brings the Muslim closer to his Lord, and keeps him from doing evil, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Recite (O Muhammad) what has been revealed to you of the Book (the Quran), and perform As-Salah (Iqamat-as-Salah). Verily, As-Salah (the prayer) prevents from Al-Fahsha (i.e. great sins of every kind, unlawful sexual intercourse) and Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism, and every kind of evil wicked deed).” [al-'Ankabut 29:45] 
The third pillar of Islam: zakah (poor due, ‘compulsory’ charity) 
Just as Allah has created people with different colours, attitudes and levels of knowledge, so too their deeds and provision vary. He has made some of them rich and some poor, to test the rich as to whether they show gratitude, and to test the poor as to whether they are patient. Because the believers are a brotherhood, and brotherhood is based on compassion, kindness, love and mercy, Allah has enjoined upon the Muslims zakah which is taken from the rich and given to the poor. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Take Sadaqah (alms) from their wealth in order to purify them and sanctify them with it, and invoke Allah for them. Verily, your invocations are a source of security for them.” [al-Taubah 9:103] 
What is the wisdom of zakah in Islam?
Zakah purifies and cleanses wealth, and purifies the soul from stinginess and miserliness. It strengthens the love between the rich and poor, takes away hatred, makes security prevail and brings happiness to the ummah.  
What is the rate of zakah?
Allah has made the payment of zakah obligatory upon everyone who owns the nisab (minimum amount) for one year. The rate of zakah on gold, silver, and trade goods is one quarter of ten percent. On agricultural produce and fruits the amount is one-tenth if it is irrigated (without artificial means), and one-half of one-tenth if it is irrigated by artificial means. Concerning an'am animals (i.e., sheep, goats, cattle and camels) the details are explained in the books of fiqh… Whoever pays zakat, Allah expiates his sins thereby, and blesses his wealth, and stores up for him a great reward. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And perform As-Salah (Iqamat-as-Salah), and give Zakah, and whatever of good (deeds that Allah loves) you send forth for yourselves before you, you shall find it with Allah. Certainly, Allah is All-Seer of what you do.” [al-Baqarah 2:110] 
Withholding zakah brings disasters and evils upon the ummah. Allah has threatened those who withhold it with a painful torment on the Day of Resurrection. He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Verily, there are many of the (Jewish) rabbis and the (Christian) monks who devour the wealth of mankind in falsehood, and hinder (them) from the way of Allah (i.e. Allah’s religion of Islamic Monotheism). And those who hoard up gold and silver (Al-Kanz: the money, the Zakah of which has not been paid) and spend them not in the way of Allah, announce unto them a painful torment.
On the Day when that (Al-Kanz: money, gold and silver, the Zakah of which has not been paid) will be heated in the fire of Hell and with it will be branded their foreheads, their flanks, and their backs, (and it will be said unto them:) ‘This is the treasure which you hoarded for yourselves. Now taste of what you used to hoard’” [al-Taubah 9:34-35] 
Concealing one’s zakah is better than paying it openly in front of people, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“If you disclose your Sadaqat (almsgiving), it is good; but if you conceal them and give them to the poor, that is better for you. (Allah) will expiate you some of your sins. And Allah is Well-Acquainted with what you do.” [al-Baqarah 2:271] 
Who is eligible to receive zakah in Islam?
When a Muslim pays his zakah, it is not permissible for him to give it to anyone except those whom Allah mentions in the ayah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“As-Sadaqat (here it means Zakah) are only for the Fuqara (poor), and Al-Masakin (the poor) and those employed to collect (the funds); and to attract the hearts of those who have been inclined (towards Islam); and to free the captives; and for those in debt; and for Allah’s Cause (i.e. for Mujahidun — those fighting in Allah’s cause), and for the wayfarer (a traveller who is cut off from everything); a duty imposed by Allah. And Allah is All-Knower, All-Wise.” [al-Taubah 9:60] 
The fourth pillar of Islam: sawm (fasting) in Ramadaan 
Fasting means abstaining from things which break the fast, such as food, drink and intercourse, from the break of true dawn until sunset, with the intention of fasting. 
The relationship of patience to faith is like that of the head to the body. Allah has enjoined upon this ummah fasting for one month of the year, in order to draw closer to Allah, to avoid that which Allah has forbidden, to get used to being patient, to bring the nafs (self) under control, to compete in generosity and to demonstrate cooperation and mutual compassion. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Observing As-Sawm (the fasting) is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, that you may become Al-Muttaqun (the pious).” [al-Baqarah 2:183] 
What are the virtues of Ramadan?
The month of Ramadan is a great month, in which Allaah revealed the Quran. The reward for good deeds, acts of charity and acts of worship are multiplied in this month. In it is Laylat al-Qadr, which is better than a thousand months. The gates of Heaven are opened and the gates of Hell are shut, and the shayateen (devils) are tied up. 
Who must fast in Ramadan?
Allah has made fasting the month of Ramadan obligatory upon every sane, adult Muslim, male and female alike, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Quran, a guidance for mankind and clear proofs for the guidance and the criterion (between right and wrong). So whoever of you sights (the crescent on the first night of) the month (of Ramadan i.e. is present at his home), he must observe Sawm (fasts) that month, and whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number [of days which one did not observe Sawm (fasts) must be made up] from other days. Allah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you. (He wants that you) must complete the same number (of days), and that you must magnify Allah [i.e. to say Takbeer (Allahu Akbar: Allah is the Most Great)] for having guided you so that you may be grateful to Him.” [al-Baqarah 2:185] 
There is a great reward with Allaah for fasting. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Every action of the son of Adam is multiplied, each good deed  receiving a tenfold to seven hundredfold reward. Allah said, ‘Except for fasting, for it is done for Me and I will give a reward for it, for he gives up his desire and food for My sake.’” (Narrated by Muslim, al-Siyam) 
The fifth pillar of Islam: Hajj (pilgrimage) 
Allah has given the Muslims a Qiblah (direction of prayer) which they face when they pray (salah) and offer supplications (du’a), wherever they may be. This qiblah is the Ancient House (the Ka’bah) in Makkah al-Mukarramah: 
“So turn your face in the direction of Al-Masjid Al-Haram (at Makkah). And wherever you people are, turn your faces (in prayer) in that direction.” [al-Baqarah 2:144 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Why do Muslims go for Hajj?
Because the Muslims are scattered all over the world, and Islam calls people to be united and get to know one another, just as it calls them to co-operate in righteousness and piety, to recommend one another to the truth, to call people to Allah and to venerate the rites of Allah – hence Allah has made it obligatory for every sane, adult Muslim who has the means, to visit His Ancient House, to circumambulate it and to perform all the rituals of Hajj as explained by Allah and His Messenger. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah) to the House (Ka‘bah) is a duty that mankind owes to Allah, those who can afford the expenses (for one’s conveyance, provision and residence); and whoever disbelieves [i.e. denies Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah), then he is a disbeliever of Allah], then Allah stands not in need of any of the ‘Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists).” [al ‘Imran 3:97]  
Hajj is an occasion on which the unity of the Muslims, their strength and pride, are made manifest. For the Lord is One, the Book is one, the Messenger is one, the ummah is one, their worship is one and their clothing is one. 
What are the conditions of Hajj?
Hajj has its own etiquette and conditions which the Muslims must observe, such as restraining their tongues, hearing and sight from all that Allah has forbidden, being sincere in their intentions, using money from good sources (for Hajj), fostering the best attitude, and avoiding everything that could invalidate the Hajj, such as sexual relations, sin or arguing unjustly, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“The Hajj (pilgrimage) is (in) the well-known (lunar year) months (i.e. the 10th month, the 11th month and the first ten days of the 12th month of the Islamic calendar, i.e. two months and ten days). So whosoever intends to perform Hajj therein (by assuming Ihram), then he should not have sexual relations (with his wife), nor commit sin, nor dispute unjustly during the Hajj. And whatever good you do, (be sure) Allah knows it. And take a provision (with you) for the journey, but the best provision is At-Taqwa (piety, righteousness). So fear Me, O men of understanding!.” [al-Baqarah 3:197]
If the Muslim does Hajj correctly, in the manner prescribed and sincerely for the sake of Allah, it will be an expiation for his sins. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does Hajj for the sake of Allah, and does not have sexual relations or commit sins, will come back like the day his mother bore him.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, no. 15210)
