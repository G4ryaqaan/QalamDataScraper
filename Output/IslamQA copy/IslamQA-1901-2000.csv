1902,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1902,The      Black Stone,"what's the importance of the BlackStone in Kaaba, what does represent ?",,,"Praise be to Allah.There are a number of ahaadeeth etc. about the Black Stone which we will quote for our brother so that he may learn from them.
1.     The Black Stone was sent down by Allah to this earth from Paradise.
 It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbas said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The Black Stone came down from Paradise.”
 (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 877; al-Nasaa’i, 2935. The hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-Tirmidhi).
  2.     The Stone was whiter than milk, but the sins of the sons of Adam made it black.
It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaa said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When the Black Stone came down from Paradise, it was whiter than milk, but the sins of the sons of Adam made it black.”
(Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 877; Ahmad, 2792. Classed as saheeh by Ibn Khuzaymah, 4/219. Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar classed it as qawiy (strong) in Fath al-Baari, 3/462).
(a)     Al-Mubaarakfoori said in al-Marqaah: This means, the sins of the sons of Adam who touched the stone, caused it to turn black. The hadeeth should be taken at face value, because there is no reason not to, either narrated in a report or by virtue of common sense.
(Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi, 3/525)
(b)    Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said: Some heretics tried to criticize this hadeeth by saying: How come the sins of the mushrikeen turned it black and the worship of the people of Tawheed did not make it white?
I answer by quoting what Ibn Qutaybah said: If Allah had willed, that would have happened. But Allah has caused it to be the case that black usually changes other colours and its not itself changed, which is the opposite to what happens with white.
(c)     Al-Muhibb al-Tabari said: The fact that it is black is a lesson for those who have insight. If sins can have this effect on an inanimate rock, then the effect they have on the heart is greater.
See Fath al-Baari, 3/463
  3.     The Black Stone will come forth on the Day of Resurrection and will testify in favour of those who touched it in truth.
  It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbas said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said concerning the Stone: “By Allah, Allah will bring it forth on the Day of Resurrection, and it will have two eyes with which it will see and a tongue with which it will speak, and it will testify in favour of those who touched it in sincerity.”
  Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 961; Ibn Maajah, 2944
  This hadeeth was classed as hasan by al-Tirmidhi, and as qawiy by al-Haafiz ibn Hajar in Fath al-Baari, 3/462
  (4)         Touching, kissing or pointing to the Black Stone – this is the first thing to be done when starting Tawaaf, whether it is for Hajj or ‘Umrah, or voluntary Tawaaf.
It was narrated from Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah (may Allah be pleased  with him) that when the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came to Makkaah, he came to the Black Stone and touched it, then he walked to the right of it and ran three times and walked four times [around the Ka’bah].
  (narrated by Muslim, 1218).
(5)              The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) kissed the Black Stone, and his ummah followed his lead in doing so.
  It was narrated that ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) came to the Black Stone and kissed it, then he said: “I know that you are only a stone which can neither bring benefit nor cause harm. Were it not that I had seen the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) kiss you, I would not have kissed you.”
  (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1520; Muslim, 1720)
  (6)          If a person is unable to kiss the Stone, he should touch it with his hand or something else, then he can kiss the thing with which he touched it.
(a)    It was narrated that Naafi’ said: I saw Ibn ‘Umar touch the Stone with his hand then he kissed his hand. I said, I have never ceased to do this since I saw the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) do it.
(Narrated by Muslim, 1268)
(b)    It was narrated that Abu Tufayl (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I saw the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) performing Tawaaf around the House, touching the corner [where the Stone is] with a crooked staff which he had with him, then kissing the staff.
(Narrated by Muslim, 1275).
(7)   If a person is unable to do the above, then he can point to it with his hand and say “Allahu akbar”.
  It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbas said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) performed Tawaaf on his camel, and every time he came to the corner [where the Stone is] he would point to it and say “Allahu akbar.”
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4987).
  (8)  Touching the Stone is one of the things by means of which Allah expiates for sins
  It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “Touching them both [the Black Stone and al-Rukn al-Yamani] is an expiation for sins.”
  (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 959. This hadeeth was classed as hasan by al-Tirmidhi and as saheeh by al-Haakim (1/664). Al-Dhahabi agreed with him).
  It is not permissible for a Muslim to annoy other Muslims at the Stone by hitting or fighting. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told us that the Stone will testify in favour of those who touched it in sincerity, which is not the case when a person touches it by disturbing the slaves of Allah.

1913,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1913,"Is it permissible for a woman to slaughter an animal, and can the meat of an animal she slaughters be eaten?","My wife asked me an interesting question:Did any of the sahabiyyat ever slaughter an animal   during the `eid?Is this a proof that women can slaughter an animal if indeed any
  of the sahabiyyat slaughtered?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The scholars of Islam are agreed that it is permissible 
  to eat the meat of an animal slaughtered by a woman, because of the general 
  terms used in the wording of the Qur’aan and Sunnah. Among the evidence 
  that it is permissible are the following:
The aayah in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
    “Forbidden for you (for food) are: al-maytatah (dead animals – 
    cattle-beast not slaughtered), blood, the flesh of swine, and the meat of 
    that which has been slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allaah, or 
    has been slaughtered for idols, etc., or on which Allaah’s Name has mot 
    been mentioned while slaughtering, and that which has been killed by strangling, 
    or by a violent blow, or by a headlong fall, or by the goring of horns – 
    and that which has been (partly) eaten by a wild animal – unless you 
    are able to slaughter it (before its death)…” 
    [al-Maa’idah 5:3]. The evidence in this aayah is the phrase where 
    Allaah has permitted us to eat of any animal that we are able to slaughter 
    before it dies; this is general in application, and does not specify as to 
    whether the person who manages to do this is a man or a woman – so it 
    could be either.
 
  Al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) reported in his Saheeh 
    from ‘Ubayd-Allaah from Naafi’, that he (Naafi’) heard Ibn 
    Ka’b ibn Maalik narrating from his father that they used to have sheep 
    which they allowed to graze on the mountain of Sala’ in Madeenah: one 
    of the slave-women noticed that one of the sheep was dying, so she broke a 
    stone and slaughtered it. He said: “Do not eat it until I ask the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or 
    I send someone to ask him. So he asked the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), or sent someone else to ask, 
    and he told him to eat it. ‘Ubay-Allaah said: “I liked the fact 
    that she was a slave-woman and she managed to slaughter it.”
  
 
Commenting on this hadeeth, Ibn Hijr (may Allaah have mercy on 
  him) said: “This shows that it is permitted to eat meat slaughtered by 
  a woman, whether she is free or a slave, old or young, Muslim or of the People 
  of the Book (i.e., Jewish or Christian), in a state of purity or otherwise, 
  because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
  be upon him) told them to eat the meat she had slaughtered and did not ask for 
  further details.”
This hadeeth also answers the question about whether any of the 
  Sahaabiyaat (female Companions of the Prophet  
  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)) slaughtered animals.
The discussion above also makes it clear that a woman may slaughter 
  animals, because of the general terms used in the texts, and there is no difference 
  in this regard between meat slaughtered as a sacrifice or meat slaughtered for 
  regular food.
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: “It is permitted to eat from an animal 
  which a man or a woman slaughters Islamically before it dies, or from meat slaughtered 
  by a woman, even if she is menstruating, because her menstruation is not in 
  her hand. It is permissible to eat meat from an animal which a woman slaughters 
  Islamically before it dies, by the consensus of the Muslims.” (Al-Fataawa, 
  35/234).",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
1916,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1916,Will We See Allah on the Day of Judgment?,Where is Allah?  Can we meet Allah on the last Judgment day?,"As for meeting Allah and seeing Him, meeting Him occurs after death and on the Day of Judgment; seeing Him will occur only on the Day of Judgment.","Where is Allah?


Will We See Allah on the Day of Judgment?","Praise be to Allah.Where is Allah?
Evidence in the Quran and Sunnah points to the fact that Allah is above the heavens , established over His Throne in a manner that befits His Majesty and Greatness. Allah says in the Quran (interpretation of the meaning):
""The Most Beneficent Istawa (rose over) the (Mighty) Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty)."" [Ta Ha 20:5]
Will We See Allah on the Day of Judgment?
As for meeting Allah and seeing Him, meeting Him occurs after death and on the Day of Judgment; seeing Him will occur only on the Day of Judgment. 
Concerning the meeting with Allah after death, Imam Al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) reported in his Sahih, in the chapter on ""whoever loves to meet Allah, Allah loves to meet him"":
From `Ubadah ibn As-Samit, from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon Him) who said: ""Whoever loves to meet Allah, Allah will love to meet him, and whoever hates to meet Allah, Allah will hate to meet him."" `Aishah or one of his wives said: ""But we all dislike the idea of death."" He said, ""It is not what you are thinking. When death approaches the believer and he is given the news of Allah’s pleasure and honour, nothing will be more dear to him than what lies ahead of him, so he will love to meet Allah and Allah will love to meet him. But when death approaches the disbeliever and he is given the news of Allah’s wrath and punishment, nothing will be more disliked by him that what lies ahead of him, so he will hate to meet Allah and Allah will hate to meet him."" (Al-Bukhari, 6026)
The words ""nothing will be more dear to him than what lies ahead of him"" refer to what he will go through after death. Muslim and An-Nisa’i report that Shurayh ibn Hani’ (may Allah have mercy on him) said: ""I said to `Aishah: `I have heard a Hadith which, if it is as I heard it, means that we are doomed. The Hadith says: ""There is not one of us who does not dislike death.""’ She said: `It is not what you think. What it means is when a person’s eyes stare without blinking, when the death rattle is in his chest and his skin and muscles contract.’ This is the state of one who is dying.
""Al-Khattabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: ""There are different types of meeting: it may mean seeing with one’s own eyes, or it may mean resurrection, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):`They indeed are losers who denied their meeting with Allah…’ [Al-An`am 6:31]; or it may mean death, as Allah says: (interpretation of the meaning): `Whoever hopes for the Meeting with Allah, then Allah’s term is surely coming…’ [Al-`Ankabut 29:5] and `Say (to them): Verily, the death from which you flee will surely meet you…’ [Al-Jumu`ah 62:8]""
The meeting with Allah (mentioned in the Hadith quoted above) refers to something other than death, because in another Hadith the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) said, ""Death is a barrier between us and the meeting with Allah."" But when death is the means of meeting Allah, it is described as the meeting with Allah. 
Imam Abu `Ubayd Al-Qasim ibn Salam (may Allah have mercy on him) said: ""The Hadith does not refer to a dislike of death and the suffering involved, because everybody feels this way. What is being criticised here is a love and preference for this world and a dislike of the idea of moving on to Allah and the Hereafter. This is explained by the fact that Allah condemned people who love this life, and said (interpretation of the meaning): `… those who hope not for their meeting with Us, but are pleased and satisfied with the life of the present world…’ [Yunus 10:7].""
An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“The meaning of the Hadith is that the like and dislike referred to are those that occur at the time of death, at the stage when repentance is no longer acceptable, when the dying person is shown where he is headed.” 
There is also some discussion in the Hadith about the dislike of death. Whoever dislikes death because he prefers this life to the blessings of the Hereafter is condemned. Whoever dislikes death because he fears being brought to account for his shortcomings, lack of preparation and failure to carry out the commands of Allah properly, is not to blame in this case. The one who feels this way should hasten to prepare himself so that when death comes to him he will not dislike it but will love it because of the meeting with Allah which he is hoping for after death.
The Hadith quoted above also indicates that no living person will see Allah in this life, but that the believers will see Him after death, as the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) said: ""Death is a barrier between us and the meeting with Allah."" This fact is stated even more clearly in another Hadith narrated by Muslim from Abu Umamah, in which the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) says: ""Know that you will not see your Lord until you die."" The meeting with Allah and seeing Him on the Day of Judgment is proven in many texts, such as the ayah (interpretation of the meaning):
""Some faces that Day will be shining and radiant, looking at their Lord."" [Al-Qiyamah 75:22-23] Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the people said, ""O Messenger of Allah, will we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection ?"" He said, ""Do you have any doubts about seeing the full moon on a cloudless night?"" They said, ""No."" He said, ""Do you have any doubts about seeing the sun on a cloudless day?"" They said, ""No."" He said, ""Then you will see your Lord in the same way."" (Al-Bukhari, 764)
We ask Allah to let us meet Him when He is pleased with us. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.

1917,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1917,Wants to embrace Islam but is married to a non-Muslim,"I have been practicing Islam for a while now and I want to insha-Allah embrace it but there are serious problems that I am encountering. My husband and I have been having marital problems for a while now and even though things are going alright I don't trust that it would be like this forever because he has these violent ourbursts of rage and I have seriously considered divorcing him after I was advised to do so by our councellor.
The problem is that I don't love him anymore and moreover he won't allow me to embrace Islam and he refuses to embrace it as well. He said that we would rather break up rather than me becoming Muslim. The other problem is that I have two daughters who are attending a Hindu School and what does the Sharia say about what happens after I convert with regards to my daughters. I have met a wonderful Muslim man and we love each other very much and he asked me twice already to marry him. I did not go to bed with him and that is not our intention. We love each other for who we are and he is willing to accept my children if they convert as well. He said that he will wait until the end of the year before he goes on with his life because there are other women who he can settle down with but I am his first preference.

Please advice me and in English please because I do not understand Arabic. I need to take action about so many things, yet I feel guilty and I feel sorry for my husband because he is trying to make our marraige to work. Unfortunately the religion is a big problem.

Your urgent help and co operation will be highly appeciated.

Jazak Allah",,,"Praise be to Allah. 

Your husband is preventing you from embracing Islam, and does not want to become Muslim himself. He prefers divorce to Islam, although you have tried to persuade him of the truth to no avail. This means that this man is no good. Moreover, you say that he is bad-tempered and violent, that any improvement is only temporary, and that you do not love him at all. If this man is as you say, he is no good from either a religious or a worldly point of view, and there is no use in staying with him. Our advice to you in this case is to leave him immediately, and try hard to gain custody of your two daughters so that they may grow up in Islam. According to Islamic shareeah, in such cases custody should be awarded to the Muslim parent, because Islam should prevail, not be prevailed over.

As regards the second part of your question, and this man whom you say is a Muslim, you must make sure that he is a chaste man, not one who is immoral or corrupt. Do not establish any relationship with him before marriage. If you find out for sure that he is chaste and solidly religious, I advise you to marry him as soon as your iddah (waiting period after divorce) is over. I ask Allaah to take care of you by His mercy, to make the right thing easy for you, to help you enter this religion and to save you from kufr and its followers. Remember the story of Pharaohs wife, who was Muslim although her husband was a kaafir. Allaah said about her (interpretation of the meaning):
""And Allaah sets forth an example for those who believe, the wife of Pharaoh, when she said: My Lord! Build for me a home with You in Paradise, and save me from Pharaoh and his work, and save me from the people who are zaalimoon (polytheists, wrong-doers and disbelievers in Allaah).""

1919,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1919,Is All Seafood Halal?,"Please forgive me for my ignorance in this matter. I am very interested in learning the ways of Islam. My question concerns dietary rulings. What types of fish and seafood are permissible?
Thank you for your help.","All kinds of food from the sea are permissible, whether they are plants or animals, alive or dead. There are certain types of water animals which are forbidden such as crocodiles, frogs, otters and turtles. For more, please see the detailed answer.","Islam: Easy to follow


Is seafood halal?


Forbidden water animals","Praise be to Allah.Islam: Easy to follow
Among the blessings that Allah has bestowed upon us is the fact that He has made our religion easy for us, and has not made it too difficult or unbearable. He has allowed us many things that were forbidden according to previously-revealed laws. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… Allah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you…” [al-Baqarah 2:185]
Is seafood halal?
Hence all kinds of food from the sea are permissible, whether they are plants or animals, alive or dead. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Lawful to you is (the pursuit of) water-game and its use for food – for the benefit of yourselves and those who travel…” [al-Maidah 5:96]. Ibn 'Abbas said: “ Sayduhu (lit. hunting, pursuit) refers to whatever is taken from it alive, and ta’amuhu (lit. its food) means whatever is taken dead.”
Forbidden water animals
There are a few things – certain types of water animals – which some scholars exclude from the permission outlined above. These are:
1- Crocodiles: The correct view is that eating these is not allowed, because they have fangs and live on land – even though they may spend a lot of time in the water – so precedence should be given to the reason for forbidding it (it is a land animal that has fangs).
2- Frogs: It is not permitted to eat them because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade killing them, as is reported in the hadith of ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn ‘Uthman, who said that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade the killing of frogs. (Narrated by Imam Ahmad and Ibn Majah; see also Sahih al-Jami’, 6970). 
The rule is that everything which we are forbidden to kill, we are not allowed to eat; if we are allowed to eat it we are allowed to kill it.
Some scholars exclude sea snakes, but the correct view is that as they live nowhere except in the water, we are permitted to eat them, because of the general nature of the ayah (interpretation of the meaning): “Lawful to you is (the pursuit of) water-game and its use for food – for the benefit of yourselves …” [al-Maidah 5:96]
3- Otters and turtles: The correct view is that to be on the safe side, it is permissible to eat them after slaughtering them properly, because they live both on land and in the sea. 
Here the rule is that in the case of animals that live both on land and in the sea, the rules concerning land animals should be given precedence, to be on the safe side, so they must be slaughtered properly, except for crabs which do not need to be slaughtered, even though they live both on land and in the sea, because they do not have blood.
Everything that can cause harm is forbidden as food, even if it comes from the sea, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… And do not kill yourselves (nor kill one another). Surely, Allah is Most Merciful to you.” [al-Nisa 4:29] and: “… and do not throw yourselves into destruction…” [al-Baqarah 2:195]
(See al-Mughni, 11/83; Hashiyah al-Rawd, 7/430; Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 3/197; and Ahkam al-At’imah by al-Fawzan).

Could you please give me some Hadith references and Quranic references to the Following:

Tuba tree
Tree of Life
Tree of Knowledge
The Cosmic Tree
The Fartherest Tree of the Heavens
These trees are mentioned in muslim literature and I am looking for their credibility
Jazak Allah Khairun",,,"Praise be to Allah. 

A number of trees are mentioned in the Qur’aan and Sunnah, some of which will be discussed below:

The date palm tree

This is a good tree to which Allaah likened the word of Tawheed when it is established in the sincere heart, where it bears fruits of good deeds that strengthen eemaan (faith).

Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""See you not how Allaah sets forth a parable? – A goodly word is as a goodly tree, whose root is firmly fixed, and its branches (reach) to the sky (i.e., very high)."" [Ibraaheem 14:24]

This is the tree to which Allaah likens the believer because it is good in all aspects, it is lasting and it offers different kinds of benefit. Ibn ‘Umar reported: ""The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘There is a kind of tree whose leaves do not fall and it is like the Muslim. Tell me what it is.’ The people mentioned different kinds of desert trees … and I said to myself, ‘It is the date palm tree,’ but I felt too shy to speak up. Then the people said, ‘Tell us what it is, O Messenger of Allaah.’ He said: ‘It is the date palm tree.’"" (al-Bukhaari, 60)

The blessed olive tree the purity of which Allaah set forth as a parable

Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
""Allaah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The parable of His Light is as (if there were) a niche and within it a lamp, the lamp is in glass, the glass as it were a brilliant star, lit from a blessed tree, an olive, neither of the east (i.e., it neither gets sun-rays only in the morning) nor of the west (i.e., nor does it get sun-rays only in the afternoon – but it is exposed to the sun all day long), whose oil would almost glow forth (of itself), though no fire touched it. Light upon Light! Allaah guides to His Light whom He wills. And Allaah sets forth parables for mankind, and Allaah is All-Knower of everything."" [al-Noor 24:35]

In Soorat al-Mu’minoon, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""And a tree (olive) that springs forth from Mount Sinai, that grows oil, and (it is a) relish for the eaters."" [al-Mu’minoon 23:20]

Abu Aseed said: ""The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""Eat the oil and use it on your hair and skin, for it comes from a blessed tree."" (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 1775; see also Saheeh al-Jaami’)

The tree which Allaah caused to grow for Yoonus (upon whom be peace) for food and healing.
 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
""And, verily, Yoonus was one of the Messengers … Then a (big) fish swallowed him and he had done an act worthy of blame. Had he not been of those who glorify Allaah, he would have indeed remained inside its belly until the Day of Resurrection. But We cast him forth on the naked shore while he was sick, and We caused a plant of gourd to grow over him."" [al-Saaffaat 37:139, 142-146]

The mufassireen (commentators) said: The gourd (al-yaqteen) is a kind of pumpkin. Some of them described the benefits of the pumpkin, such as: it grows quickly, it provides shade, it has large, smooth leaves, it keeps flies away and its fruit provides good nourishment: it can be eaten raw or cooked, and its skin may be eaten too. It is known that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) liked this kind of pumpkin and used to look for it on the plate of food. (Tafseer Ibn Katheer).

The great tree in heaven where our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saw his father Ibraaheem (upon whom be peace)

Samurah ibn Jundub reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, describing his vision: ""Then we went up until we reached a green garden, in which there was a great tree, with an old man and children at its base, and another man near the tree, trying to light a fire in front of him. They took me up to that tree and into a house; I have never seen any more beautiful than that house. In it there were men, old men, youths, women and children. Then they brought me out and took me up to the tree and into another house, even better than the first one. In this house there were old and young men. I said: ‘You have shown me around tonight; tell me about what I have seen.’ They said, ‘Yes… the old man at the foot of the tree was Ibraaheem (upon whom be peace), and the children around him were the children of mankind…"" (al-Bukhaari, 1270).

Sidrat al-Muntaha, by which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saw Jibreel when he was taken up into the heavens

Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
""And indeed he (Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saw him (Jibreel) at a second descent (i.e., another time), near Sidrat al-Muntaha (the lote tree of the utmost boundary, beyond which none can pass), near it is the Paradise of Abode, when that covered the lote-tree which did cover it! The sight (of Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)) turned not aside (right or left), nor did it transgress beyond (the) limit (ordained for it). Indeed, he did see of the Greatest Signs of his Lord (Allaah)."" [al-Najm 53:13-18]

The phrase translated here as ""when that covered the lote-tree which did cover it"" is explained by the hadeeth narrated by Imaam al-Bukhaari from Abu Dharr, in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""It was covered in colours, I do not know what they are…"" According to a hadeeth narrated by Abu Sa’eed and Ibn ‘Abbaas, he said: ""It was covered by the angels."" According to a report narrated by Muslim, he said: ""When it was covered with whatever covered it by the command of Allaah, it changed, and none of the creation of Allaah could describe its beauty.""

In the famous hadeeth about his Mi’raaj (ascent into heaven), the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said that when Jibreel took him up into the heavens, he went through from one heaven to the next by the command of Allaah, until he reached the seventh heaven. He said: ""Then I was taken to Sidrat al-Muntaha; its fruits were like the pitchers of Hajar and its leaves were like the ears of elephants. He said, ‘This is Sidrat al-Muntaha’…"" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 3598).

The reason why it is called Sidrat al-Muntaha is stated in the hadeeth narrated from Ibn Mas’ood by Imaam Muslim: ""There everything that comes up from earth stops (yantahee), and it is taken from there, and there everything that comes down stops, and it is taken from there."" Al-Nawawi said: It is called Sidrat al-Muntaha because the knowledge of the angels stops at that point, and no one has gone beyond it except the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).

It is the tree at which the knowledge of every Prophet who has been sent and every angel who is near to Allaah stops. What lies beyond it is unseen; no one knows it except Allaah or the one to whom He tells it. It was said that this is the ultimate destination of the souls of the martyrs.

The fruits described in the hadeeth are well known: they are the fruits of the lotus tree. Al-Khattaabi said that the phrase ""like the pitchers of Hajar"" meant that they were big like pitchers; this is something that was known to the first listeners, which is why this analogy was used. Hajar is a place-name. The phrase ""its leaves were like the ears of elephants"" is also indicative of huge size.

The Tree of Tooba in Paradise

Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""In Paradise there is a tree in whose shade a rider could travel for a hundred years without crossing it. Recite, if you wish: ‘In shade long-extended’ [al-Waaqi’ah 56:30]"" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 4502)

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""Tooba is a tree in Paradise, one hundred years big. The clothes of the people of Paradise are made from its calyces (outer casing of its flowers)."" (Reported by Ibn Hibbaan; see also Saheeh al-Jaami’, 3918)

‘Utbah ibn ‘Abdin al-Salami said: ""A Bedouin came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and asked him about al-Hawd (the cistern). He mentioned Paradise, then the Bedouin asked him, ‘Is there fruit there?’ He said, ‘Yes, and there is a tree called Tooba.’ The Bedouin asked, ‘What tree of this world does it resemble?’ He said, ‘It does not resemble any tree of your land. Have you been to Syria?’ He said, ‘No.’ He said, ‘It resembles a tree in Syria called al-Jawzah (walnut) which grows on one trunk then spreads its branches higher up.’ The Bedouin asked, ‘How big is its trunk?’ He said, ‘If one of the camels of your people was to go around it, it would not complete one circuit before its neck broke of old age and exhaustion. The Bedouin asked, ‘Are there grapes there?’ He said, ‘Yes.’ He asked, ‘How big is a bunch?’ He said, ‘The distance a crow could fly without stopping in a month.’ He asked, ‘How big is one grape?’ He said, ‘Does your father ever slaughter a he-goat from his flocks?’ He said, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘And does he skin it and give the hide to your mother, and say, ""Make me a bucket""?’ He said, ‘Yes.’ The Bedouin asked, ‘Is one grape big enough to satisfy me and my family?’ He said, ‘Yes, and your whole tribe.’"" (Reported by Imaam Ahmad).

The tree of Zaqqoom, which is the food of the people of Hell

This tree is described in the Qur’aan as (interpretation of the meaning): ""… the accursed tree (mentioned) in the Qur’aan"" [al-Israa’ 17:60].
Allaah also says about it (interpretation of the meaning):

""Then, moreover, verily, - you the erring-ones, the deniers (of Resurrection)! You verily will eat of the trees of Zaqqoom. Then you will fill your bellies therewith, and drink boiling water on top of it, so you will drink (that) like thirsty camels! That will be their entertainment on the Day of Recompense!"" [al-Waaqi’ah 56:51-56]

""Verily, the tree of Zaqqoom, will be the food of the sinners, like boiling oil, it will boil in the bellies, like the boiling of scalding water. (It will be said): ‘Seize him and drag him into the midst of blazing Fire, then pour over his head the torment of boiling water, taste you (this)! Verily, you were (pretending to be the mighty, the generous! Verily! This is that whereof you used to doubt!’"" [al-Dukhaan 44:43-50]

""Is that (Paradise) better entertainment or the tree of Zaqqoom (a horrible tree in Hell)? Truly We have made it (as) a trial for the Zaalimoon (polytheists, disbelievers, wrongdoers, etc.). Verily, it is a tree that springs out of the bottom of Hell-fire, the shoots of its fruit-stalks are like the heads of shayaateen (devils); truly they will eat thereof and fill their bellies therewith. Then on the top of that they will be given boiling water to drink so that it becomes a mixture (of boiling water and Zaqqoom in their bellies). Then, thereafter, their return is to the flaming fire of Hell."" [al-Saafaat 37:62-68]

The tree under which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) accepted his Companions’ pledge of allegiance unto death and not to desert him.
This happened during the campaign of al-Hudaybiyah, when he heard of the betrayal of the mushrikeen. This tree is also mentioned in the Qur’aan (interpretation of the meaning):
""Indeed, Allaah was pleased with the believers when they gave the Bay’ah (pledge) to you (O Muhammad) under the tree…"" [al-Fath 48:18]

The tree next to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to preach

Jaabir ibn ‘Abdullaah (may Allaah be pleased with him and his father) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to go and stand next to a tree or palm-tree on Fridays. A woman or a man of the Ansaar said: ""O Messenger of Allaah, should we not make for you a minbar (""pulpit"")?"" He said, ""If you wish."" So they made a minbar for him, and when the next Friday came, he was shown to the minbar. The tree cried like a small child, then the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came down and hugged the crying tree until it calmed down."" Jaabir said: ""It was crying because of the dhikr (remembrance of Allaah) that it used to hear."" (al-Bukhaari, 3319).

The tree from which Allaah spoke to Moosa (upon whom be peace) and sent him as a Prophet

Allaah says in the Qur’aan (interpretation of the meaning):
""So when he reached it (the fire), he was called from the right side of the valley, in the blessed place from the tree: ‘O Moosa! Verily! I am Allaah, the Lord of the ‘Aalameen (mankind, jinns and all that exists)!"" [al-Qasas 28:30]

The tree from which Allaah forbade our father and mother (Aadam and Hawwa) to eat

Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
""And O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in Paradise, and eat thereof as you both wish, but approach not this tree, otherwise you both will be of the Zaalimoon (unjust and wrong-doers)."" [al-A’raaf 7:19]

""Then Shaytaan whispered to him, saying: ‘O Adam! Shall I lead you to the Tree of Eternity and to a kingdom that will never waste away?"" [Ta-Ha 20:120]

""So He misled them with deception. Then when they tasted of the tree, that which was hidden from them of their shame (private parts) became manifest to them and they began to stick together the leaves of Paradise over themselves (in order to cover their shame). And their Lord called out to them (saying): ‘Did I not forbid you that tree and tell you: Verily Shaytaan is an open enemy to you?’"" [al-A’raaf 7:22]

The cedar tree to which Allaah likened the kaafir (disbeliever)

Abu Hurayrah said: ""The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘The example of the believer is like that of a plant which is continually bent over by the wind; the believer is continually beset with afflictions. The example of a hypocrite is like that of the cedar tree, which does not yield until it is uprooted in one go."" (Muslim, 5024)

The scholars of Arabic language said: the cedar (al-arz) is a tree similar to the stone pine tree, which grows in Syria and Armenia. According to another report, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""The example of the kaafir is that of the firmly-rooted cedar which does not yield to anything until it is uprooted in one go.""

The scholars said: The meaning of this hadeeth is that the believer suffers a great deal, in his physical health, with his family and with his wealth, but this is an expiation for his sins and will raise his status. The kaafir, however, suffers little, but even if something happens to him it will not expiate for his sins at all; he will come with a full burden of sin on the Day of Resurrection.

The tree in the righteous vision that was narrated concerning the sajdah (prostration) to be performed when reciting certain aayaat of the Qur’aan

Ibn ‘Abbaas said: A man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: ""O Messenger of Allaah, last night I had a dream in which it was as if I was praying behind a tree. I prostrated and the tree prostrated after me. I heard it saying: ‘Allaahumma uktub li bihaa ‘indaka ajran wada’ ‘anni bihaa wizran waj’alhaa li ‘indaka dhukhran wa taqabbalha minni kamaa taqabbaltahaa min ‘abdika Daawood (O Allaah, record for me because of it (the sajdah) a reward, alleviate some of my burden, and make it an investment on my behalf with You. Accept it from me as You accepted it from Your slave Daawood).’"" Ibn ‘Abbaas said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) recited an aayah where a sajdah is required, then he prostrated, and I heard him saying the same words that the man had reported that the tree had said. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 528)

The two trees which came together to conceal the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when he was answering the call of nature

This was recorded in the saheeh report narrated by Imaam Muslim, may Allaah have mercy on him, from Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him): ""… We stopped in a fragrant valley, and the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) wanted to answer the call of nature. I followed him, bringing a bottle of water, but he could not find anywhere where he could conceal himself. There were two trees at the edge of the valley, so the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) went to one of them, took hold of one of its branches, and said: ‘Follow me, by the permission of Allaah.’ So it followed him like a camel being led by a rope, until he came to the other tree. He took one of the other tree’s branches and said: ‘Follow me, by the permission of Allaah.’ So it followed him until he reached the halfway point between them, then he put them together and said: ‘Stay together and cover me, by the permission of Allaah.’ So they stayed together."" Jaabir said: ""I kept away, for fear that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) might feel my presence and move even further away. So I sat down, thinking to myself, and when I turned around, I saw the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) coming towards me, and the two trees had separated and taken up their former positions."" (Saheeh Muslim, 5328)

Trees (plants) with foul-smelling ""fruits"" after eating which the Muslims are forbidden to come to the mosque

Jaabir said: ""The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Whoever eats of these vegetables (the first time he said ‘garlic,’ then ‘garlic, onions and leeks’), let him not come near us in our mosques, for the angels will be offended by whatever offends the people.’"" (al-Nisaa’i, 700)

The trees (all except the gharqad) which will show the Jews to the Muslims so that they may kill them during the great battle at the end of time

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""The Hour will not come until the Muslims fight the Jews and kill them. The Jews will hide behind rocks and trees, and the rocks and trees will say: ‘O Muslim, O slave of Allaah! There is a Jews behind me, come and kill him!’ (All the trees will say this except for the gharqad (box-thorn), for it is one of the trees of the Jews.’"" (Reported by Imaam Ahmad; it is a saheeh hadeeth).

These are a number of the trees mentioned in the Qur’aan and Sunnah, from which we may learn many lessons. We ask Allaah to help us benefit from these lessons. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

However, I came upon some information that I found rather disturbing.
It is regarding the Kaaba and the origin of Islam. I was told that Abraham and Ishmael removed all the idols from the Kaaba, but there was one in particular who's name meant ""diety"". I read that this is where the name ""Allah"" came from and that this diety was the pagan Moon god.
His symbol is the crescent moon and Ramadhan is scheduled around lunar activity. I would like an answer to whether or not such a religion existed and is Islam really connected to this pagan practice?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Welcome to a lady who is seeking the true religion and is interested in Islam. We ask Allaah to show you the truth and help you to follow it, and to protect you from Shaytaan and his doubts, and the misguidance of the enemies of Islam.

Before I answer your question, I would like to remind you that the way to find out the truth about a religion is to refer to its authentic sources, which in the case of Islam means the Quraan, which is the Word of Allaah, and the Sunnah, which is the words of the Prophet of Islam, Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), to whom Allaah sent Revelation.

One of the mistakes made by some of those who investigate Islam is to refer to sources that are not authentic or material written by those who have ulterior motives and who are enemies of Islam spreading lies about it, to put people off and lead them astray from the Way of Allaah.

Turning to your question about the Kabah, and Ibraaheem and Ismaaeel (upon whom be peace), it is very strange to say that they removed all the idols from the Kabah except one. This contradicts the historical facts, and does not make sense, because it is known that Ibraaheem and Ismaaeel were the ones who built the Kabah, on the command of Allaah how could they then have taken idols out of it? How could there have been any idols in it when they were supervising its construction and maintenance by remembering Allaah and calling people to perform Tawaaf around it and come on pilgrimage to it only for the sake of Allaah? The idols came many years afterwards, when some of the Arabs travelled to the kaafir lands outside the Arabian Peninsula and brought back idols, some of which were placed around the Kabah. Then the mushrikeen added more idols until there were 360 of them around the Kabah. This remained the case until Allaah sent Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). This was the dawning of the light of Tawheed which drove out the darkness of idolatry. Through him, Allaah defeated the mushrikeen; he broke the idols and purified the Sacred House, thus restoring the Kabah to the pure worship of the One God, as it had been at the time of his forefather Ibraaheem, the Friend (Khaleel) of Allaah.

There follows an account of the building of the Ancient House, from the Quraan and the Ahaadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). We will begin by quoting from the Quraan, where Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):

""And (remember) when Ibraaheem said: My Lord, make this city (Makkah) a place of security and provide its people with fruits, such of them as believe in Allaah and the Last Day. He (Allaah) answered, As for him who disbelieves, I shall leave him in contentment for a while, then I shall compel him to the torment of the Fire, and worst indeed is that destination!
And (remember) when Ibraaheem and (his son) Ismaaeel were raising the foundations of the House (the Kabah), (saying): Our Lord! Accept (this service) from us. Verily! You are the All-Hearer, the All-Knower.
Our Lord! And make us submissive unto You and of our offspring a nation submissive unto You, and show us our manaasik (all the ceremonies of pilgrimage Hajj and Umrah), and accept our repentance. Truly, You are the One Who accepts repentance, the Most Merciful.
Our Lord! Send amongst them a Messenger of their own, who shall recite unto them Your Verses and instruct them in the Book and al-Hikmah (full knowledge of the Islamic laws and jurisprudence or wisdom or Prophethood, etc.), and sanctify them. Verily, You are the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.""
[al-Baqarah 2:126-129]

""And (remember) when We showed Ibraaheem the site of the (Sacred) House, (saying): Associate not anything (in worship) with Me, and sanctify My House for those who circumambulate it, and those who stand up for prayer, and those who bow (submit themselves with humility and obedience to Allaah), and make prostration (in prayer, etc.)
And proclaim to mankind the Hajj (pilgrimage). They will come to you on foot and on every lean camel, they will come from every deep and distant (wide) mountain highway (to perform Hajj).""
[al-Hajj 22:26-27]

As regards the story of the construction of the Kabah in the Sunnah, Ibn Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) narrated the story of Haajar, the wife of Ibraaheem and the mother of his son Ismaaeel. In his report, he said:
"" Ibraaheem brought her and her son Ismaaeel, while she was still breast-feeding him, and left them in a place near the Kabah (meaning near the place where the Kabah was later built) under a tree on the spot of Zamzam (meaning the place where Zamzam later appeared), at the highest place in the mosque. In those days there was no-one in Makkah nor was there any water. So he left them there and placed near them a leather bag containing some dates, and a water-skin containing some water, then he set off for home. Ismaaeels mother followed him and said: O Ibraaheem, where are you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to enjoy)? She said this many times, but he did not look back at her. Then she asked him, Has Allaah commanded you to do this? He said, Yes. She said, Then He will not forsake us, and returned, while Ibraaheem went on his way. When he reached al-Thaaniyah, where they could not see him, he turned to face the Kabah, raised his hands and offered the supplication: O Our Lord! I have made some of my offspring dwell in an uncultivable valley, by Your Sacred House in order, O Our Lord, that they may perform al-Salaat (iqaamat al-salaat), so fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allaah) provide them with fruits so that they may give thanks. [Ibraaheem 14:37]

Ismaaeels mother went on suckling Ismaaeel and drinking from the water (she had). When the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. She started looking at him tossing in agony; she left him because she could not endure looking at him, and found that the mountain of al-Safaa was the nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could not see anybody. Then she descended from al-Safaa and when she reached the valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble, till she crossed the valley and reached the mountain of al-Marwa, where she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between al-Safaa and al-Marwa) seven times."" Ibn Abbaas said: ""The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: This is the origin of the tradition of al-Saee (the walking) of people between them (al-Safaa and al-Marwa). When she reached al-Marwa (for the last time), she heard a voice and she made herself quiet and listened attentively. She heard the voice again and said, O (whoever you may be)! You have made me hear your voice; have you got something to help me? And behold! She saw an angel at the place of Zamzam, digging the earth with his heel (or his wing), till water flowed from that place. She started to make something like a basin around it, using her hands in this way, and started filling her water-skin with water from her hands, and the water was flowing out after she had scooped some of it."" The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) added: ""May Allaah bestow mercy on Ismaaeels mother! Had she let the Zamzam (flow without trying to control it) (or had she not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin), Zamzam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth."" The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) further added: ""Then she drank (water) and suckled her child. The angels said to her: Dont be afraid of being forsaken, for this is the House of Allaah which will be built by this boy and his father, and Allaah never forsakes His people. The House at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents came, they flowed to its right and left. She lived in that way until some people from the tribe of Jurhum or a family from Jurhum passed by her and her child, as they (the Jurhum people) were coming through the way of Kadaa. They stopped and stayed in the lower part of Makkah where they saw a bird that had the habit of flying around water and not leaving it. They said, This bird must be flying around water, although we know that there is no water in this valley. They sent one or two messengers who discovered the source of water, and returned to inform them about it. So, they all came (towards the water)."" The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) added: ""Ismaaeels mother was sitting near the water. They asked her, Do you allow us to stay with you? She replied, Yes, but you will have no right to possess the water. They agreed to that."" The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) further added: ""Ismaaeels mother was pleased with the whole situation, as she used to love to enjoy the company of the people. So, they settled there, and later on they sent for their families who came and settled with them so that some families became permanent residents there. The child (Ismaaeel) grew up and learnt Arabic from them, and (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up. When he reached the age of puberty, they made him marry a woman from amongst them. After Ismaaeels mother had died, Ibraaheem came after Ismaaeels marriage in order to see his family that he had left before Then Ibraaheem came and saw Ismaaeel under a tree near Zamzam, sharpening his arrows. When he saw Ibraaheem, he stood up to welcome him and they greeted one another as a father greets his son or a son greets his father. Ibraaheem said, O Ismaaeel, Allaah has given me an order. Ismaaeel said: Do what your Lord has ordered you to do. Ibraaheem asked, Will you help me? Ismaaeel said, I will help you. Ibraaheem said, Allaah has ordered me to build a house here, pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it."" The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) added: ""Then they raised the foundations of the House (Kabah). Ismaaeel brought the stones and Ibraaheem was building, and when the walls became high, Ismaaeel brought this stone and put it for Ibraaheem, who stood on it and carried on building, while Ismaaeel was handing him the stones, and both of them were saying: Our Lord! Accept (this service) from us. Verily! You are the All-Hearer, the All-Knower. [al-Baqarah 2:127]. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) added, ""Then both of them went on building and going around the Kabah saying, Our Lord! Accept (this service) from us. Verily! You are the All-Hearer, the All-Knower."" (Saheeh al-Bukhaari, 3113)

Having outlined the historical details of the building of the Kabah, we move on to the idea mentioned in your question that the name of Allaah was derived from the name of an idol. This is an extremely odd idea. How can the name of the Creator, the Evolver, the First, the Almighty, the Compellor be derived from the name of a created idol that could neither benefit nor harm anyone?

Allaah says, rebuking the mushrikeen (polytheists) (interpretation of the meaning): ""Yet they have taken besides Him other gods that created nothing but are themselves created, and possess neither hurt nor benefit for themselves, and possess no power (of causing) death, nor (of giving) life, nor of raising the dead."" [al-Furqaan 25:3]

""You worship besides Allaah only idols, and you only invent falsehood. Verily, those whom you worship besides Allaah have no power to give you provision, so seek your provision from Allaah (Alone), and worship Him (Alone), and be grateful to Him. To Him (Alone) you will be brought back."" [al-Ankaboot 29:17]

Allaah describes how Ibraaheem (upon whom be peace) rebuked his father and his people for worshipping idols (interpretation of the meaning):
""When he said to his father: O my father! Why do you worship that which hears not, sees not and cannot avail you in anything?"" [Maryam 19:42]

""And recite to them the story of Ibraaheem, when he said to his father and his people: What do you worship? They said: We worship idols, and to them we are ever devoted. He said, Do they hear you, when you call (on them)? Or do they benefit you or do they harm (you)? They said, Nay, but we found our fathers doing so. He said, Do you observe that which you have been worshipping, - you and your ancient fathers? Verily! They are enemies to me, save the Lord of the Aalameen (makind, jinn and everything that exists), Who has created me, and it is He Who guides me."" [Al-Shuaraa 26:69-78]

Concerning Ibraaheems destruction of his peoples idols, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
""Then he turned to their gods and said, Will you not eat (of the offering before you)? What is the matter with you that you speak not? Then he turned upon them, striking (them) with (his) right hand. Then they (the worshippers of idols) came towards him, hastening. He said, Worship you that which you (yourselves) carve? While Allaah has created you and what you make?"" [al-Saaffaat 37:91-96]

After reading all this, how can it be said that Ibraaheem left one idol near the Kabah, and that the name of Allaah is derived from the name of an idol? Do you know what ""Allaah"" means and where this name is derived from?

The blessed name ""Allaah"" is derived from the Arabic verb alaha/yalahu/malooh [the root of which is the three letters alif, laam, haa]. This verb includes the meaning of love as well as worship. Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, is the One Who is loved, glorified and feared by the believers, and they put their hope in Him.

As regards to your last question, about whether Islam has anything to do with the worship of idols or heavenly bodies, this is a strange matter indeed. Islam proclaimed the absolute unity of Allaah (Tawheed) and taught that He Alone is to be worshipped, with no partners or associates. Islam came to fight idolatry and put an end to it, so how can it possibly be connected to idol-worship?

Perhaps you have read in the Quraan the story of the hoopoe who believed only in Allaah; he knew Who his Lord was, and denounced the worship of stars and planets. Allaah says, relating how His Prophet Sulaymaan (upon whom be peace) conveyed the story to the queen of Yemen at that time (interpretation of the meaning):

""[The hoopoe said] and I have come to you from Saba (Sheba) with true news. I found a woman ruling over them, and she has been given all things that could be possessed by any ruler of the earth, and she has a great throne. I found her and her people worshipping the sun instead of Allaah, and Shaytaan has made their deeds fair-seeming to them, and has barred them from (Allaahs) Way, so they have no guidance, so that they do not worship (prostrate before) Allaah, Who brings to light what is hidden in the heavens and the earth, and knows what you conceal and what you reveal. Allaah, none has the right to be worshipped but He, the Lord of the Supreme Throne!"" [al-Naml 27:22-26]

There is also the story of how Ibraaheem rebuked his people for worshipping heavenly bodies, the sun and moon, which Allaah has told us in Soorat al-Anaam (the sixth soorah).

The fast of Ramadaan is not connected to the moon because we worship the moon, but because the Lord of the moon has made it a marker of time for us, by which we may organize our worship and other affairs. So we look for the new moon of Ramadaan so that we may worship Allaah Alone by fasting, and we look for the new moon of the following month to mark the end of this annual act of worship. We also look for the timings of Hajj and other acts of worship in a similar way.

We hope that this has helped you understand anything that was not clear to you before. Note that this is a serious issue, and it is not something to be taken lightly. The only religion with Allaah is Islam, which He has chosen for His slaves, and He will not accept any other religion. Come and join the religion of truth, and follow what your Lord has revealed.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

he is not her Mahram. My question is this: I live with my parents and 
brother and sister. I and my brother pay the rent of the apartment. 
Insha'Allah we are going to move to a rented house which will be bigger 
and the rent will be payed by me and my brother. I had thought of getting 
married because of the bigger house, but I don't know whether I could do 
this now unless I get my own separate house. Please answer my question 
as soon as possible, Jazakumulah Khyran",,,"Praise be to Allah.
  There is no harm in you and your wife living in one house with the rest of the 
  family members you mentioned. All that you have to be careful about is that 
  your wife does not go out in front of your brother or be alone with him in the 
  house, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
  of Allaah be upon him) forbade non-mahrams (unrelated men) to enter upon women. 
  He said: ""Beware of entering upon women."" One of the Sahaabah said 
  to him, ""O Messenger of Allaah, what about the brother-in-law?"" He 
  said: ""The brother-in-law is death!"" (Reported 
  by al-Bukhaari, Fath al-Baari, 9/330).
  Al-Nawawi, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: ""What is referred to in 
  the hadeeth is all the husbands (male) relatives apart from his father 
  and sons. People customarily take the matter of a man being alone with his brothers 
  wife as being of little consequence; to indicate the seriousness of the matter, 
  it was likened to death. Indeed, one should be more cautious about the brother-in-law 
  than about a stranger. The phrase ""the brother-in-law is death"" may 
  have a number of meanings:

That being alone with a brother-in-law 
      may lead to disaster if a sin is committed, or may spell divorce for the 
      woman if her husband cannot contain his jealousy;
Or: Beware of being alone with a non-mahram

 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)
      praised Uways and urged his Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with him) to ask him to make
      du’aa’ for them (the hadeeth of Uways al-Qurani was
      reported by Muslim, no. 2542). Did Shaykh al-Islam

    because he is going to a place where one hopes his du’aa’s will be answered,
    such as travelling or going for Hajj or ‘Umrah, etc., is OK in principle. But if
    there is the fear that something that is not right may result from it, such as the person
    who makes the request relying on the person whom he has asked, or always relying on other
    people with regard to matters in which he should call on his Lord, or there is the fear
    that the person of whom the request is made may become arrogant and think that he has
    reached such a level that people ask him to make du’aa’ for them, then this is
    sufficient reason not to do this, because in this case it leads to something that is not
    right. If it does not lead to something that is not right, then in principle it is
    permissible, but still we say that it should not be done, because it was not the custom of
    the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) to ask one another to make du’aa’
    for one another. The hadeeth in which the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
    him) is reported to have said to ‘Umar, “Do not forget us in your
    du’aa’, O my brother” (reported by Abu Dawood, no. 1498, and
    al-Tirmidhi, no. 3557) is a weak hadeeth and there is no proof that the
    Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said this.
    With regard to the fact that the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with
    them) asked the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to make
    du’aa’ for them, it is well-known that no one else can reach the level of the
    Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), so when ‘Ukaashah ibn Muhsan
    asked him to pray that he would be one of those who would enter Paradise without being
    called to account or being punished, he said, “You will be one of them” (reported
    by al-Bukhaari, no. 6541; Muslim, no. 216, 218, 220), and when another man
    came and asked the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to ask Allaah to
    send them rain, he did so (reported by al-Bukhaari, no. 1013; Muslim, 897).
    With regard to the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)
    advising his companions to ask Uways al-Qurani to make du’aa’ for them, this
    undoubtedly applied only in his case, and it is known that Uways was not on the same level
    as Abu Bakr or ‘Umar or ‘Uthmaan or ‘Ali, or other Sahaabah. The Prophet 
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not tell anyone among his Sahaabah to ask
    anyone to make du’aa’ for them.
To sum up, we can say: there is no sin in asking someone to make
    du’aa’ for you that you hope will have his du’aa’ answered, on the
    condition that this does not involve anything that is wrong, but it is better and more
    appropriate not to do this.","Liqa’ al-Baab al-Maftooh by Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 212"

Is this halaal?",,,"Praise be to Allah.This is a competition, and Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) thought that there was nothing wrong with competitions on issue of sharee’ah. He explained this by pointing out that jihaad may be either with knowledge or with weapons. He also used as evidence the reports about Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) when the aayah (interpretation of the meaning) “Alif-Laam-Meem. The Romans have been defeated in the nearer land (Syria, Iraq, Jordan and Palestine), and they, after their defeat, will be victorious, within three to nine years…” [al-Room 30:1-4] was revealed. The Persians were the ones who had defeated the Romans; the Romans were Christians, People of the Book, whilst the Persians were Magians (Zoroastrians), who had no revealed Book. Allaah said (interpretation of the meaning): “… And on that day, the believers (i.e., Muslims) will rejoice (at the victory given by Allaah to the Romans against the Persians).” [al-Room 30:4], because the believers wanted the Christians to defeat the Persians as the Christians were People of the Book and therefore closer to Islam than the Magians. Quraysh, on the other hand, wanted the Magians to defeat the Romans, and said, “The Romans cannot defeat the Persians, because the Persians are stronger than they are, and they do not believe in the Qur’aan.” So Abu Bakr bet them a number of camels that (the Romans) would prevail within seven years. The seven years passed and nothing had happened. Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) went to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who told him, “Add two years, and increase the bet”
(reported by Ibn Jareer in his Tafseer, 10/165, 166, no. 27876) – because the word bid’ used in the aayah refers to any number between three and nine. So the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told him to play it safe by increasing the time period and increasing the prize. Abu Bakr did this, and before the two years had passed, travellers brought news that the Romans had defeated the Persians.

They said that the hadeeth “There is no prayer for the one who stands alone behind a row”
(reported by Ahmad in al-Musnad, 4/23 and by Ibn Maajah, no. 1003, and classed as saheeh by al-Albani in al-Irwa’, no. 514) is like the hadeeth “There is no prayer when there is food prepared” (reported by Muslim, no. 560). The meaning is that the prayer is not proper and complete. But there is a report from Ahmad that the prayer of the person who stands alone behind the row is not valid at all. This is the well-known view in the madhhab of Imaam Ahmad: the prayer of the person who stands alone behind the row is not valid in any circumstances, even if the last row is full.
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah took a moderate view, and said: “If the row is full, then the prayer of the one who stands alone behind the row is valid, because in this case he is not able to be a part of the row, and Allah does not burden a person beyond his scope. If the row is not full, then it is not right for him to pray standing alone behind the row, because he has no excuse.” This is the view of Shaykh al-Islam and of our Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Sa’di (may Allah have mercy on him). This is the view that we think is correct, which is that if the row is full, pray standing on your own, and do not pull someone out of the row to join you or go and stand with the imaam in front. This is the correct opinion, which we think is closer to the Sunnah than the opinion that the prayer of the one who stands on his own is absolutely invalid or is unconditionally valid.

 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came
    from Makkah to Madeenah, he used to face Bayt al-Maqdis when he prayed, and that remained
    the case for sixteen or seventeen months, as is proven in the two Saheehs (al-Bukhaari and
    Muslim), in the hadeeth of al-Baraa ibn Aazib (may Allaah be pleased with him
    and his father), who said: The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
    him) prayed towards Bayt al-Maqdis for sixteen or seventeen months, and he was hoping that
    the Qiblah would be towards the House (i.e., the Kabah)
Then after that Allaah commanded him to face the direction of the
    Kabah (the Sacred House), in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): 
    so turn your face in the direction of al-Masjid al-Haraam (at Makkah). And wheresoever you
    people are, turn your faces (in prayer) in that direction [al-Baqarah
    2:144].
Before we answer the question about the wisdom behind this change, we must
    note the following points:
When we Muslims hear of a command from Allaah, we must accept it and
      submit to it, even if the wisdom behind it is not clear to us, as Allaah says
      (interpretation of the meaning): It is not for a believer, man or woman, when
      Allaah and His Messenger have decreed a matter, that they should have any option in their
      decision [al-Ahzaab 33:36]
Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, does not give any command without
      there being great wisdom behind it  even if we do not understand it  as He
      says (interpretation of the meaning):  That is the judgement of Allaah. He
      judges between you. And Allaah is All-Knowing, All-Wise. [al-Mumtahinah 60:10]
Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, does not abrogate any rule except
      to replace it with something better or similar to it, as He says (interpretation of the
      meaning): Whatever Verse (revelation) do We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, We
      bring a better one or similar to it. Know you not that Allaah is able to do all
      things? [al-Baqarah 2:106]
Having understood this, we may note that the wisdom behind the changing of
    the Qiblah has several aspects, including:
It is a test for the true believer, because the true believer, unlike
      others, accepts the commands of Allaah. Allaah has spoken of this in the Quraan
      (interpretation of the meaning):  And We made the Qiblah which you used to
      face, only to test those who followed the Messenger from those who would turn on their
      heels. Indeed it was great (heavy) except for those whom Allaah guided
      [al-Baqarah 2:143]
This ummah is the best of nations, as Allaah says (interpretation of the
      meaning): You are the best of peoples ever raised up for mankind
      [Aal Imraan 3:110]. Confirming the aayat about the Qiblah, Allaah says
      (interpretation of the meaning): Thus We have made of you (true Muslims) a Wasat
      (just) (and the best) nation [al-Baqarah 2:143]. Wasat
      conveys meanings of justice and of being chosen. So Allaah has chosen for this ummah
      goodness in all things and the best commands and rules, and thus He chose for them the
      Qiblah of Ibraaheem, upon whom be peace.
Imaam Ahmad reported in his Musnad (6/134-135) from
    Aaishah that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said
    about the People of the Book (Jews and Christians): They do not envy us for anything
    as much as they envy us for Yawm al-Jumuah (Friday), to which Allaah has
    guided us and from which they have gone astray, and for the Qiblah to which Allaah has

The prohibition to imitate non-Muslims","Praise be to Allah.Are earnings haram in Islam?
Earrings and bracelets are forms of adornment for women. Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed men who make themselves look like women and women who make themselves look like men . (Al-Bukhari, 5435)
Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed men who wear women’s clothes and women who wear men’s clothes. (Reported by Abu Dawud in al-Sunan, Kitab al-Libas, Bab fi libas al-nisa)

On this basis, it is not permitted for men to wear earrings or nose-rings.
The claim that this is permissible because the people of Quraysh used to do that needs to be proven, in the first place, and where is the proof?
Even if they used to do this in the Jahiliyyah (Time of Ignorance before Islam), Islam came and forbade men to wear the adornment of women or to make themselves look like them, as is clear from the hadiths quoted above. What matters is the ruling of Islam, not what Quraysh or other tribes may have done.
The kinds of female adornment known among Quraysh and others include earrings, bracelets, anklets and bangles worn on the upper arm. The point is that these are known as forms of women’s adornment since ancient times.
Can men wear silver rings?
Islam has given men sufficient scope to adorn themselves by allowing them to wear silver rings . Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wore a ring made of silver, and the people did likewise. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 5417)
Islam also allows men to wear gold and silver when necessary to replace a lost tooth or nose, and so on.
The prohibition to imitate non-Muslims
We would say that any Muslim man who wears jewellery is making himself look like the disbeliever , because this is known to be their style of adornment. The latest fashion among them is to wear earrings and the like in their ears, noses , lips, cheeks and other parts of the body (so-called body-piercing ). 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Whoever imitates a people is one of them. (Reported by Abu Dawud, al-Sunan, Kitab al-libas, Bab libas al-shuhrah).
Whoever does this should repent to Allah and not engage in the futile defence of falsehood. He should be distinct in both his personality and his dress from the disbelievers, as Islam has commanded us to be. Allah is the One Who guides to the Straight Path.

1983,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1983,Is there a specific number of times that one should visit Makkah?,"I was recently told by two sources
  that in the Sunnah there is a reference to fulfilling an Islamic precept that one should
  visit Mecca 7 times in ones life and Jerusalem once.  Could you please help me verify
  this as I have been unable to.
  Thank you very much for your help.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Whoever makes any claim about Islamic teachings 
  should produce sound evidence. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“… Say: ‘Produce your proof 
  if you are truthful.’ ” [al-Baqarah 2:111]
So it is not permitted to accept anyone’s 
  opinion without evidence or proof. What evidence is there that a Muslim should 
  visit Makkah seven times and Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem) once in his lifetime?!
Allaah has made it a duty to perform Hajj once 
  in a lifetime. The Prophet  (peace and blessings 
  of Allaah be upon him) said: “O people, Allaah has made Hajj a duty upon 
  you, so perform Hajj.” A man asked, “(Should we do it) every year, 
  O Messenger of Allaah?” but he remained silent. The man asked the question 
  three times, then the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
  of Allaah be upon him) said: “If I say yes, it will be obligatory for you, 
  and you will not be able to do it.” Then he said: “Do not push me 
  to tell you more than I have told you. Those who came before you were destroyed 
  because they asked too many questions and argued with their Prophets. If I command 
  you to do something, then do as much of it as you can, and if I forbid you to 
  do something, then leave it well alone.” (Reported by Muslim, 
  2380)
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And 
  perform properly (i.e., all the ceremonies according to the ways of Prophet 
  Muhammad), the Hajj and ‘Umrah (i.e., the Pilgrimage to Makkah) for Allaah…” 
  [al-Baqarah 2:196]
The person who performs Hajj and ‘Umrah 
  once in his lifetime does not have to do them again, but it is encouraged to 
  repeat Hajj and ‘Umrah, because the Prophet  
  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Follow up one Hajj or 
  ‘Umrah with another, for they eliminate poverty and sins as the fire eliminates 
  dross from iron, gold and silver. An accepted Hajj brings no less a reward than 
  Paradise.” (Reported and classed as hasan by al-Tirmidhi, al-Sunan, 
  738). The Muslim who is capable and healthy is encouraged not 
  to stay away from the Ancient House (i.e., the Ka’bah) for too long, as 
  Abu Hurayrah reported that the Messenger of Allaah  
  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah says: ‘If 
  a slave to whom I have given good health and ample provision does not come to 
  visit Me once every five years, he is indeed deprived.’” (Reported 
  by Ibn Hibbaan and others; see Saheeh al-Jaami’, 1909). 
All of the above reports indicate that frequent visits to Makkah 
  are encouraged, but they are not obligatory.
As far as visiting Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem) 
  is concerned, if a Muslim never visits it in his lifetime, there is nothing 
  wrong with that. There are no obligatory acts of worship connected with it, 
  but it is the third of the great Mosques which a Muslim is permitted to travel 
  to visit; it is not permitted to travel to any other place for the purpose of 
  prayer and worship, except these three mosques. The Prophet  
  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No one should set out 
  on a journey (of pilgrimage) except to three mosques: Masjid al-Haram [in Makkah], 
  the Mosque of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
  blessings of Allaah be upon him) and Masjid al-Aqsaa [in Jerusalem].” (Reported 
  by al-Bukhaari, 1115). The reward for praying in Masjid al-Aqsaa 
  will be multiplied over the reward for praying in any other mosque, apart from 
  Masjid al-Haram in Makkah and Masjid al-Nabi  (peace 
  and blessings of Allaah be upon him) (The Prophet’s Mosque) in Madeenah. 
  The author of Mughni al-Muhtaaj said: “It has been proven that prayer 
  in Masjid al-Aqsaa is worth five-hundred times more than other prayers, as was 
  reported by Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr; al-Bazzaar said: its isnaad is hasan.”
 Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah said: “The Messenger of Allaah 
   (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
  ‘One prayer in this Mosque of mine is better than a thousand prayers in 
  any other mosque except for al-Masjid al-Haram, and one prayer in al-Masjid 
  al-Haram is better than one hundred thousand prayers offered elsewhere.’” 
  (Reported by Imaam Ahmad; see also Saheeh al-Jaami’, 3838).

This is a great effort that you have undertaken, and you are to be 
congratulated for the results of your research and your questioning of the 
Muslim girls.
What you need to know are the basic matters which are easy to learn, such 
as the meaning of the Shahaadatayn (the two statements of faith) - which 
are the key to Islam - and the six pillars of faith (eemaan) and the five pillars 
of Islam. You should also learn how to pray so that you can begin to pray 
after you pronounce the Shahaadatayn. You can find a lot of information 
on these matters on this website, in the section on 'aqeedah (correct belief), 
under the headings ""Issues relevant to accepting and embracing Islam"" and 
""Basic tenets of Islam for non-Muslims.""
As regards your mother, we hope that she will not try to stop you 
becoming a Muslim. Treat her with kindness and tell her about Islam in 
beautiful words - maybe she will embrace Islam too. If you are afraid that 
she may turn against you if she knows about your Islam, then you do not 
have to tell her about it. Embrace Islam in secret, and do as much as you 
can of your duties towards Allaah. Allaah will never forsake you; in fact, 
He will help you and support you, if you turn to Him. We ask Allaah to 
help you follow the truth and adhere to it. We are prepared to offer any 
help that we can. Peace be upon those who follow true guidance.

According to the Gregorian calendar, the beginning of the Prophetic mission happened around 608 or 609 CE.

What you have heard - that it is obligatory to have intercourse on the first 
night of marriage - is not correct at all. Not having intercourse on that night 
is not a sin, and does not prevent one from celebrating the waleemah

wedding night is their concern alone, and they know best what will suit their 
own personalities. This is a good opportunity to remind Muslim men and 
women of the importance of verifying whatever they hear, and to warn 
them not to accept Islamic rulings from people who are not qualified to 
give them. We ask Allaah to help us learn that which will benefit us, and to 
benefit us from that which we learn.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
1990,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1990,Ruling concerning root vegetables (those which grow under the ground),"Asalam mu alay koem
Dear Brother,
 Please let me know if this is true or not, a lady whom i go to Talim
  Classes with has told me that vegetables grown under ground are makroo, and to cook many
  makrooh things in one pot is Haram.
 We are very used to making stew with more than 5 or 6 vegetables which are
  grown underground all in one pot. Is she telling the truth or is she mistaken.
  Wasalaam,
Sha",,,"Praise be to Allah.Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“He it is Who created for you all that 
  is on earth…” [al-Baqarah 2:29]
“O mankind! Eat of that which is lawful 
  and good on the earth…” [al-Baqarah 2:168]
“Say: ‘Who has forbidden the adornment 
  with clothes given by Allaah, which He has produced for His slaves, and al-Tayyibaat 
  [all kinds of halaal (lawful) things] of food?’…” [al-A’raaf 
  7:32]
From this, we know that everything that grows from 
  the earth is in principle halaal (permitted), and no-one should decree it to 
  be haraam (forbidden) or makrooh (disliked) without sound Islamic evidence 
  (daleel). What evidence is there that things that grow beneath the ground, 
  like potatoes, carrots and onions, etc., are makrooh? What is the strange 
  principle on the basis of which this lady – about whose background we know 
  nothing – states that cooking a number of “makrooh” things 
  in one pot results in haraam food?
If the resulting dish was intoxicating or poisonous, or was 
  cooked with something haraam such as pork, then we would say that it is haraam 
  to eat it. But the cooking of five or six kinds of root vegetables together, 
  as you describe, is something permissible, and there is nothing wrong with it. 
  We advise you not to give any weight to the words of those who have no knowledge.

1994,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1994,Discipline of Orphans,"There is a Muslim who married a widow who has two children from her first marriage.Which Islamic rights has this man towards the children? Has the man the right to tell or force the children to pray? Is the boy allowed to call him ""daddy""? 

Is there any case he must treat them differently?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Yes, he should order them to pray, as the Prophet 
   (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
  “Instruct the child to pray when he reaches the age of seven…” 
  (Reported by Abu Dawood in al-Sunan, Kitaab al-salaat, Baab mataa yu’mar 
  al-sabiyyu bi’l-salaat).
The scholars said: “The child should be taught about tahaarah 
  (purity and cleanliness, i.e., wudoo’ etc) and prayer when he reaches 
  the age of ten years.”
The meaning of discipline or instruction is to smack (lightly when and if necessary), threaten and rebuke. The child’s guardian should teach him about tahaarah 
  and salaat (prayer), and tell the child to do these things, when he reaches the 
  age of seven, and he should discipline him and force him to do them when he 
  reaches the age of ten.
The guiding principle here is the hadeeth (narration)of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
  him): “Teach the child to pray when he is seven, and smack him (lightly)if he does not pray when he is ten.” (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, who said it is a hasan/sound hadeeth).
According to another report, he said: “Tell 
  the child to pray when he is seven, and smack him (lightly) if he does not do it when he is ten, and separate them in their beds.” This training is ordained 
  by Islam to teach the prayer and let the child get used to praying, so that 
  he will be accustomed to it and will not forget it when he reaches puberty. 
  There is no difference between boys and girls in this matter of discipline. 
  (See Al-Mughni by Ibn Qudaamah, Baab sifat al-salaat).
Some people may not feel comfortable about disciplining orphans, 
  but the right approach is for their guardian to teach them and direct them in 
  whatever way is beneficial, even if this involves being harsh with the child 
  for his own sake. There is nothing wrong with that, as the poet said:
“He was harsh so that they would understand. Let the one 
  who is determined and resolved be harsh sometimes towards those for whom he 
  cares.”
The scholars said: “(A guardian) has the right to (lightly) smack an orphan under his care just as he would (lightly) smack his own child.” 
  (See Al-durr al-mukhtaar: Baab al-ta’zeer).
