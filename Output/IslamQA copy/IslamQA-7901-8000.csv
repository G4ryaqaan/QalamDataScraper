Hanging up pictures of animate beings deprives the people of that house of a great blessing, which is the entrance of angels into that house.
Abu Sa’id al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The angels do not enter a house in which there are statues or pictures.” (Narrated by Imaam Ahmad; see also Sahih al-Jami’, 1961)
You can replace them, if you wish, with pictures of inanimate objects, such as trees, mountains, oceans and other natural scenes, or other drawings of inanimate objects, without being extravagant or wasteful.
As for the pictures which are hanging, you have to remove them and blot them out or burn them; do not keep them . 
It is worth noting that hanging up pictures of the dead is one of the things that renews grief and serves no useful purpose; it may even lead to some kind of veneration which goes against Tawhid. 
Let us not forget that the shirk committed by the people of Nuh (peace be upon him) started because they set up pictures and images of some righteous people who had lived among them. So be very careful. May Allah help us and you to do all that pleases Him and earns His forgiveness!

7945,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7945,Was the adhan    revealed by wahy or was it suggested by a sahaabi?,"I think i once read that the adhan (call to prayer)was suggested to our prophet Muhammed ( ) by another muslim after he said he didnt want to use the bells that the christians used or the rams-head(?) that the jews used to call people to prayer. How does the idea of everything the prophet ordered being an inspiration that is inspired fit in with this?
I am not trying to be picky here, but am asking purely to aid my understanding.",,,"Praise be to Allah.“Adhan” in Arabic means conveying; in Islam it means announcing that the time (for prayer) has come. It was prescribed during the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in Madeenah. According to the hadeeth of ‘Abd-Allah ibn Zayd ibn Abd Rabbihi, when the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) decided to use a bell even though he disliked it because it was like what the Christians used, ‘there appeared to me in a dream a man who was wearing two green garments, in whose hand was a bell. I said, “O slave of Allah, will you sell that bell?” he said, “What will you do with it?” I said, “We will call the people to prayer with it.” He said, “Shall I not show you something better than that?” I said, “Yes.” He said, “Say, Allahu akbar Allah akbar … (to the end of the adhaan).” When morning came, I went to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and told him what I had seen. He said, “This is a true dream, in sha Allah. Get up with Bilaal and tell him what you have seen, so that he can give the call, because he has a more beautiful voice than you.” So I got up with Bilaal and started telling him what I had seen, and he gave the call to prayer. ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab heard that whilst he was in his house, and he came out, dragging his cloak behind him, saying, “By the One Who sent you with the truth, O Messenger of Allah, I saw the same as he saw.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “To Allah be praise.”’
(Narrated by Ahmad, 1588; al-Tirmidhi, 174; Abu Dawood, 421, 430; Ibn Maajah, 698).
It is clear from this hadeeth:
That the words of the adhan came in a dream which was seen by a great sahaabi and approved of by our great Prophet. They were not a suggestion as you mentioned, but a dream, and it is known that dreams are one of the seventy parts of Prophethood, because it was stated in a hadeeth narrated by Ibn ‘Umar that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Dreams are one of the seventy parts of Prophethood.”
(Narrated by Ahmad, 4449).
Al-Bukhaari narrated a different version: “True dreams are one of the forty-six parts of Prophethood.”
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari,, 6474; Muslim, 4203, 42005).
The dream here, which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) described as a true dream, came from Allah and was not a suggestion from a person. So it was a part of Prophethood because it was approved of by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and was described by him as a true dream. If the Prophet had not approved of it, it would not have been considered a true dream and it would not have been a part of Prophethood. The one who judged it to be true was the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and the one who commanded them to act upon it was the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who received revelation (wahy) from his Lord.
‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) had seen a similar dream. Let us not forget that ‘Umar was one of the Rightly-guided khaleefahs (al-khulafaa’ al-raashidoon), of whom the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “I exhort you to adhere to my sunnah (way) and the sunnah of the rightly-guided khaleefahs. Hold on tight to it with your back teeth.”
(Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2600; Ibn Maajah, 43; Ahmad, 16519).
‘Umar’s view frequently coincided with the wahy and divine legislation. ‘Aa’ishah reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say, “Among the nations who came before you there were people who were muhaddathoon (inspired). If there is anyone like this in my ummah, it is ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab.”
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3282; Muslim, 2398). Ibn Wahb said muhaddathoon means inspired.
You may ask, why did the adhan start in this fashion, being seen in a dream by two sahaabis then being confirmed by the wahy? Why was it not revealed directly? The answer is that Allah decrees whatever He wills, however He wills, may He be glorified and exalted. Perhaps the way it happened was meant to demonstrate the virtue of these two sahaabis and to confirm the how good this ummah is, because among them are some whose opinions coincide with the wahy and some who had true dreams which confirmed their truthfulness, for the people who have the truest dreams are the truest in speech as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said.
Finally:
The definition of the Sunnah given in the books of the scholars is that it consists of everything that was narrated from the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), everything that he “said, did or approved of.”
What is meant by his words and actions is clear. What he approved of refers to when someone did something in front of him and he approved of it – this is also part of the sharee’ah, not because that person did it, but because the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) approved of it. The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) never kept quiet about falsehood and he never approved of anything false or misguided that was done by others. He would disapprove of it and speak out against it, as he did in the case of the sahaabi Abu Israa’eel, as was narrated by Ibn ‘Abbaas, who said: “Whilst the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was giving a khutbah, he saw a man standing in the sun, and he asked about him. They said, ‘That is Abu Israa’eel. He vowed to stand and not sit down, not to seek shade, not to speak, and to fast.’ He said, ‘Tell him to speak, seek shade and sit down, but let him complete his fast.’”
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6326).
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) approved of Abu Israa’eel’s vow to fast, but he cancelled the rest of his vow and did not approve of it.
So it is clear that the adhan became part of the religion when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) confirmed what Allah had shown the two sahaabis in their dreams, and commanded ‘Abd-Allah ibn Zayd to teach it to Bilaal so that he could call the people to prayer. Hopefully the explanation given above will dispel your confusion and make matters clearer to you. We ask Allah to grant us and you understanding of Islam.

7951,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7951,Why Allaah creates mentally disabled people,Why has Allah created mentally Disabled people,,,"Praise be to Allah.One of the basic principles 
          of Islam is to believe in the wisdom of the Lord in what He creates 
          and commands, and in what He wills and decrees, in the sense that He 
          does not create anything in vain and He does not decree anything in 
          which there is not some benefit for His slaves. So everything that exists 
          is His will and decree. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
          
“Allaah is the Creator of all 
          things” [al-Ra’d 13:16] 
 His perfect wisdom decrees 
          that He creates opposites, so He has created angels and devils, night 
          and day, purity and impurity, good and ugly, and He has created good 
          and evil. He created His slaves with differences in their bodies and 
          minds, and in their strengths. He has made some rich and some poor, 
          some healthy and some sickly, some wise and some foolish. By His wisdom, 
          He tests them, and He tests some by means of others, to show who will 
          be grateful and who will be ungrateful. Allaah says (interpretation 
          of the meanings): 
“Verily, 
          We have created man from Nutfah (drops) of mixed semen (sexual discharge 
          of man and woman), in order to try him, so We made him hearer and seer. 
          
Verily, We showed 
          him the way, whether he be grateful or ungrateful” [al-Insaan 
          76:2] 
“Who 
          has created death and life that He may test you which of you is best 
          in deed”
[al-Mulk 67:2] 
          
 When the sound believer 
          sees disabled people, he recognizes the blessing that Allaah has bestowed 
          upon him, so he gives thanks for His blessing, and He asks Him for good 
          health. He knows that Allaah is Able to do all things. 
 People are incapable 
          of comprehending Allaah’s wisdom. He cannot be questioned as to what 
          He does , while they will be questioned. Glorified and exalted be He. 
          Whatever you understand of His wisdom, believe in it, and whatever you 
          cannot understand, say, “Allaah knows best and is most wise, and we 
          know nothing except that which You have taught us, and He is the All-Knowing,

7961,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7961,"Her mother told
    her that a fortune-teller said that her marriage will be miserable!","my mother recently went to a fortune
      teller (which she is definetly not supposed to because it's haraam) and she was telling me
      that the fortune teller said that i will have a bad life if i marry my soon-to-be husband
      and that we will not stay together for more than 2 years.... i know that only Allah knows
      the future but i've been really worried by what she said....and what can i do to
      potentially ""reverse""this from happening.... really i'm so confused i don't know
      what to think.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: may Allaah reward you for your belief that
    Allaah alone knows the unseen  this is what we hope for you and for every sincere
    Muslim woman  and this is one of the essentials of faith in Allaah Alone.
But we wonder how, after saying this, you can be afraid of one who
    knows nothing of the unseen?
You have to be assured and put your trust completely in Allaah, for
    nothing will happen to you except that which has been decreed by Allaah.
Secondly:
The ruling on fortune-telling, i.e., soothsaying, and claiming to know
    the unseen, is that these are actions which condemn a person to Hell and put him beyond
    the pale of Islam.
Thirdly:
Fortune-tellers cooperate with the jinn; they are liars who cooperate
    with the shayaateen (devils), who do not help them except after they have changed their
    religion, and whoever changes his religion [leaves Islam] is to be executed. The ruling
    concerning those who go to them and believe them is that they are guilty of kufr; if they
    do not believe them, their prayers will still not be accepted from them for forty days.
The evidence (daleel) for the former is the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah,
    according to which the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
    Whoever goes to a fortune-teller and believes what he says, has disbelieved in what
    was revealed to Muhammad. (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 135; Abu Dawood, 3904;
    Ibn Maajah, 639; Ahmad, 9252. The hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-Haakim (1/49), and
    al-Dhahabi agreed with him. Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said, it has two corroborating reports
    narrated by al-Bazzaar with good isnaads. See al-Fath, 10/217)
    The evidence (daleel) for the latter is the report from
    one of the wives of the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who said:
    the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Whoever
    goes to a fortune-teller and asks him about anything, his prayers will not be accepted for
    forty days. (Narrated by Muslim, 2230).
    Fourthly:
How the fortune-teller gets his information was explained
    in the hadeeth narrated by Abu Hurayrah, in which the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him) said: When Allaah decrees a matter in heaven, the angels beat
    their wings in submission to His words, making a sound like a chain striking a rock. When
    the fear is banished from their hearts, they say, What is it that your Lord has said? They
    say: The truth, and He is the Most High, the Most Great. Then the one who is listening out
    hears that, and those who are listening out are standing one above the other 
    Sufyaan [one of the narrators] demonstrated with his hand, holding it vertically with the
    fingers outspread.  So he hears what is said and passes it on to the one below
    him, and that one passes it to the one who is below him, and so on until it reaches the
    lips of the soothsayer or fortune-teller. Maybe the meteor will hit him before he can pass
    anything on, or maybe he will pass it on before he is hit. He tells a hundred lies
    alongside it, but it will be said, Did he not tell us that on such and such a day, such
    and such would happen? So they believe him because of the one thing which was heard from
    heaven. (narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4424).
    Fifthly:
When the Shaytaan listens out to hear what the angels say to one
    another about the decree of Allaah, this is part of the knowledge of the seen, it does not
    not mean that the shayaateen have knowledge of the unseen. Then they add a hundred lies to
    that word, such as when a fortune-teller says that So and so will give birth to a boy, and
    the people see that he was right about that so they believe in him, but he adds lies about
    the child, saying that he will get married in such and such a year and will die in such
    and such a year and other such details. So he gains a high stature in peoples hearts
    and they seek to get close to him by bringing him gifts and money, and he makes a
    profession out of these lies when the people believe in him, and so he makes a living by
    haraam means.
Sixthly:
Not every fortune-teller is a kaahin (soothsayer). He may be a
    geomancer or reader of coffee-cups, because the kaahin, unlike the others, is one
    who receives information from the jinn. The others are just liars, but the same ruling
    applies to them, because they claim to have knowledge of the unseen, although the kaahin
    who cooperates with the shayaateen is more of a kaafir because the kufr of
    fortune-telling is compounded by the kufr of his interacting with the shayaateen,
    who do not give him what he wants until after he directed some acts of worship towards
    them in a manner which takes him out of Islam.
Seventhly:
You have to advise your mother not to go anywhere near these liars,
    lest she falls into sin or her good deeds are wiped out. Do not give up the idea of
    marriage, because marriage brings many benefits. It is an important matter which is part
    of the fitrah (natural inclinations of man) and of the religion. Your life will not be
    miserable, in sha Allaah; be optimistic and hope for a good and happy life. We ask Allaah
    to join you with a husband who is knowledgeable and righteous.
If something bad happens, and you marry someone with whom you are
    miserable, this is because of the decree of Allaah (qadaa and qadar), not because of
    what the accursed fortune-teller said or because he knows the unseen. This may happen as a
    test or trial. In any case, going ahead with the marriage  in addition to its own
    great benefits  will be a way of snubbing these liars and fortune-tellers, and those
    who believe in them. May Allaah help us and you to do all that is good. May Allaah bless
    our Prophet Muhammad.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
7966,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7966,How to    memorize the Holy Quran,Please could you give me some advice on memorsing the Quran such as techniques,,,"Praise be to Allah.Important rules for memorizing the Holy Quran.


Sincerity. It is essential to have a pure and sincere intention and a proper aim. One should learn the Quran and pay attention to it for the sake of Allah and attaining Paradise and earning the pleasure of Allah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): So worship Allah (Alone) by doing religious deeds sincerely for Allahs sake only. Surely, the religion (i.e. the worship and the obedience) is for Allah only [al-Zumar 39:2-3]. According to a hadeeth qudsi, Allah says: I am so self-sufficient that I am in no need of having an associate. Thus he who does an action for the sake of someone else as well as for My sake will have that action rejected by Me to the one whom he associated with Me. So there will be no reward for the one who reads and memorizes Quran for the sake of showing off or gaining a good reputation.


Correct pronunciation and reading. This can only be learned by listening to someone who reads well or has memorized properly. The Quran can only be learned from a teacher. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) learnt it orally from Jibreel, and the Sahaabah learned it orally from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Then it was passed down orally from the Sahaabah to succeeding generations of this Ummah.


Deciding the amount to be memorized each time. The one who wants to learn the Quran should decide how much he wants to memorize each time. After he has set out his objective and learned the correct pronunciation, he has to keep on repeating it over and over. This repetition should be with the proper intonation so as to avoid getting bored and so that he can memorize it properly. The intonation makes a person enjoy listening to it, helps him to memorize it and makes the tongue get used to that intonation, so that he will spot mistakes immediately, as the rhythm will be interrupted. This is in addition to the fact that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, He is not one of us who does not recite the Quran with a rhythmic intonation. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari).


Not going beyond what one has decided to learn in one day until one has memorized it perfectly. The haafiz should never move on to a new portion until he has perfectly memorized the prvious portion , so that it will stick in his mind. One thing that will help the student to memorize it is to preoccupy himself with it night and day, by reciting it in the prayers where Quran is to be recited silently, and if he is leading others in prayer, by reciting it out loud. He can also recite it during his naafil prayers, and whilst waiting for (congregational) prayers. In this way it will become easy for him to memorize Quran. Everyone can do this, even if he is busy with other things.


Adhering to one style of writing in the Mus-haf you use for memorizing. One thing that will help in memorizing Quran is to have one's own copy of the Mus-haf (i.e., choosing a specific edition) and never changing it. This is because people learn as much by looking as by listening, so the pattern of the verses and where they appear on the pages of the Mus-haf stays in the mind as one reads and looks at the Mus-haf. So if a person changes the Mus-haf from which he is learning, or he learns from various Masaahif where the relative positions of the aayaat may vary, he will get confused and it will be difficult for him to memorize.


Understanding is the key to memorization. One of the things which is of the greatest help in memorizing is understanding the verses one is learning and knowing how they are connected to one another. This means that the haafiz has to read the tafseer of some of the aayahs and soorahs which he is memorizing and he has to focus his mind when he is reading. This will help him to remember the verses. But when he is committing the verses to memory, he should rely on understanding; what he has to do is rely on repetition so that it will be easy for him to memorize them.


Not moving on until one has learned a soorah well. After having memorized one soorah, the haafiz should not move on to another soorah until he has memorized the first soorah perfectly from beginning to end and he can recite it fluently without having to think too hard about it. Remembering it should be easy, and he should not move on to another soorah until he is sure that he has memorized the first one.


Continually reciting to someone else. The haafiz should not rely upon training by himself; he has to recite what he has memorized to another haafiz, or to someone else who can follow his recitation in the Mus-haf. This other person should be someone who knows how to recite Quran properly, so that he can point out any mistakes or omissions in pronunciation or reading. It often happens that an individual may memorize a soorah incorrectly by himself, and he does not realize this even when he looks at the Mus-haf. So the person who wants to memorize a soorah looks in the Mus-haf and does not see where he is making a mistake in his recitation. So reciting to another person is an excellent means of correcting ones mistakes.


Continually following up. When it comes to memorization, the Quran is different from any other material such as poetry or prose, in that it may be quickly forgotten. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: By the One in Whose hand is my soul, it tries harder to run away than a hobbled camel (Agreed upon). One only has to leave it for a little while and it escapes ones mind and is quickly forgotten. So one has to keep reviewing it and always work hard at retaining what one has memorized of the Quran. Concerning this, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: The one who has memorized Quran is like the owner of a hobbled camel. If he pays attention to it and takes care of it, he will keep it, but if he lets it go, he will lose it (Agreed upon). This means that the one who has memorized the Quran has to recite it regularly as part of his wird [regular dhikr]. At least he should recite one of the thirty juz and at most he should recite ten juz each day, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Whoever reads the whole Quran in less than three days does not understand it (Agreed upon). By continually reciting it in this fashion he will retain what he has memorized.


Paying attention to the parts of the Quran which resemble one another. The parts of the Quran resemble one another in their meanings and wording. Allah says: (interpretation of the meaning): Allah has sent down the Best Statement, a Book (this Quran), its parts resembling each other (in goodness and truth) (and) oft-repeated. The skins of those who fear their Lord shiver from it (when they recite it or hear it). Then their skin and their heart soften to the remembrance of Allah [al-Zumar 39:23]. So the good reader of Quran has to pay particular attention to those parts which resemble one another, i.e., the parts where the wording is similar, as this will help him to memorize it properly.


Making the most of the best years. The one who is truly blessed is the one whom Allah enables to make the most of the best years for memorizing, which come approximately between the ages of five and twenty-three. During these years, a person is able to memorize things very well. Before the age of five, he is not able to do that, and after the age of twenty-three his ability to memorize declines whilst his ability to understand increases. So young people of these ages should make the most of it and memorize the Book of Allah, because they are at the age when they will be able to learn it quickly and will be slow to forget it, unlike when they get older. He spoke the truth who said, Learning by heart when one is young is like engraving something on stone; learning something when one is old is like engraving something on water.


It is our duty towards the Book of Allah that we should memorize it properly, accept and follow its guidance, and make it the constitution of our lives, the light of our hearts, the comfort of our souls. Hopefully these rules will form a good foundation for those who sincerely want to memorize the Book of Allah properly.

  for the delay.
If 
  she did not have any excuse for missing the prayers, but denied that they are 
  obligatory, or thought that they did not matter, or was too lazy to do them, 
  then the correct scholarly view is that if a person who does not pray because 
  he does not think the prayers are obligatory, or he is too lazy or he thinks 
  they do not matter, there is no way that he can make up these prayers. There 
  are deeds which must be done for Allaah at night, and He does not accept them 
  during the day, and deeds which must be done during the day which He does not 
  accept at night. (See the book: I want to repent, but…) 
  The person who deliberately does not pray is a kaafir, if he does not pray at 
  all; but if he repents and prays, he comes back to Islam, and he does not have 
  to make up what he has missed, but he is advised to do a lot of naafil prayers.

  me for what I have done in the past and what I will do in the future, in secret 
  and openly in my life? What more can I do so that Allaah will forgive me?” 
The 
  response was: 
Repentance 
  wipes out whatever (sins) came before it. So long as you have repented sincerely 
  – al-hamdu Lillaah – and you are doing the duties enjoined upon you by 
  Allaah and avoiding what He has forbidden, then Allaah will forgive whatever 
  came before that repentance. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Say: 
  “O ‘Ibaadi (My slaves) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing 
  evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allaah, verily, Allaah forgives 
  all sins” [al-Zumar 39:53] 
  – even shirk, if the person who committed shirk then repents from 
  it to Allaah, He will accept his repentance. Allaah says (interpretation of 
  the meaning):
“Say to those who have disbelieved, if they 
  cease (from disbelief), their past will be forgiven” [al-Anfaal 8:38]. The 
  Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
  him) said: “Islam wipes away whatever (sins) came before it, and repentance 
  wipes away whatever (sins) came before it.” (Narrated 
  by Ahmad, 4/204). If you have repented sincerely and you do what Allaah 
  has enjoined upon you and avoid that which He has forbidden, this will be sufficient 
  in sha Allaah for your past sins to be forgiven, but you must good deeds in 
  the future, and keep on repenting and obeying the Islamic commandments which 
  Allaah has enjoined upon you.
 And 
  Allaah knows best.

7974,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7974,An Ismaili is asking about the differences between us and them,"The suni mulsim was RESITING QURAN we are also resiting quran they are also reasiting ead namaz we are also we are also reasiting ead namaz and etc. 
THEN WHY WE HAVE TWO RELIGIOUS SHIA & SUNI",,,"Praise be to Allah.All of those who belong to 
          Islam and bear witness that there is no god except Allaah and that Muhammad 
          is the Messenger of Allaah recite the Qur’aan and affirm that salaah, 
          fasting, zakaah and Hajj are obligatory. But they are divided into different 
          groups, each of which has its own way as regards beliefs and acts of 
          worship. The best of these groups is Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah, who adhere to the Qur’aan and 
          Sunnah both outwardly and inwardly, and who follow the Messenger of 
          Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
          Allaah be upon him) and the first Muslims, the Muhaajireen and Ansaar. 
          Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say 
          (O Muhammad to mankind): “If you (really) love Allaah, then follow me 
          (i.e. accept Islamic Monotheism, follow 
          the Qur’ششn 
          and the Sunnah), Allaah will love you” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:31] 
“And 
          the foremost to embrace Islam of the Muhaajiroon and the Ansaar and 
          also those who followed them exactly (in Faith). Allaah is well-pleased 
          with them as they are well-pleased with Him. He has prepared for them 
          Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise), to dwell therein forever. 
          That is the supreme success” [al-Tawbah 9:100] 
 The worst of these groups are the hypocrites 
          (munaafiqeen) who make 
          an outward display of faith whilst concealing kufr 
          (disbelief). They speak words which do not reflect what is in their 
          hearts. They are the ones of whom Allaah says (interpretation of the 
          meaning): 
 “And 
          of mankind, there are some (hypocrites) who say: ‘We believe in Allaah 
          and the Last Day,’ while in fact they believe not… 
And when they meet those who believe, 
          they say: ‘We believe,’ but when they are alone with their Shayaateen 
          (devils — polytheists, hypocrites), they say: ‘Truly, we are with you; 
          verily, we were but mocking’” [al-Baqarah 2:8, 14]
 Between these two groups are others 
          which vary in their degree of closeness to good and evil. The Ismailis 
          are an extreme Raafidi group who make an outward display of loyalty 
          to Ameer al-Mu’mineen ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him) whilst concealing 
          disbelief in Allaah, His angels, His Books and His Messengers. Hence 
          some of the scholars said concerning the Faatimis, who were same as 
          the Ismailis, that they make an outward display of being Raafidis, but 
          they conceal in their hearts pure kufr. They are also called Baatinis 
          because they claim that the texts and laws have hidden (baatin) 
          meanings other than those which are known to the Muslims. For example, 
          they say that the five prayers refer to the knowledge of their secrets, 
          the fast of Ramadaan is the concealment of their secrets, and Hajj is 
          travelling to meet their shaykhs. But the baatini 
          school of thought – which includes the Ismailis – is based on secrecy. 
          Their real beliefs are secrets which are known only to their leaders, 
          and these leaders are deluding the ordinary people, enslaving and exploiting 
          them, demanding from them sums of money to be paid at certain times, 
          expecting absolute obedience from them and scaring them by telling them 
          that if they go against them they will be stricken with calamities. 
          They command them to be different from the Sunnis with regard to fasting, 
          ending the fast and Hajj, although they may show some tolerance and 
          act friendly in order to deceive them. You are one of the ordinary Ismailis, 
          and you do not know the secrets that the leaders have. They do not think 
          that you are qualified to know them, because they know that if you and 
          others like you were to discover these secrets, you would be disgusted 
          and would have nothing more to do with them, and you would reject their 
          beliefs. They want you to continue being a follower, enslaved to them, 
          and they want to retain their leadership over you. Fear Allaah and free 
          yourself from this enslavement to someone other than Allaah and following 
          someone other than the Messenger of Allaah  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), because there is no one 
          who should be followed apart from the Messenger  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). May Allaah bless you with 
          guidance to the Sunnah and keep you away from the path of bid’ah; may 
          He open your eyes to the truth that He is Able to do all things.",Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Barraak
7989,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7989,He married a woman without a guardian,"I am in a foreign land and married a Christian girl who is also a foreigner in that country. Both of us do not have any relatives or friends or contacts in that country. I proposed to her and she accepted so I read the marriage statements and she accepted and than I read the marriage statement for my acceptance. I forgot the Mehr in statement but later paid some amount to her. There was no guardian for her as she is adult and independent and we could not arrange any witness.  is:  
1. Whether this is a valid religious marriage and is it not sin in Islam as we do not care for the social or legal aspect because we are foreigners. In other word we married keeping in view our God and do not want to be punished by God on day of judgment. (We lived like man & wife for some days).
2. As I was not sure about religious aspect of this marriage, we mutually decided that I should divorce her, and I did. Is it OK?
3. Do I need to marry her again if our marriage was not OK, in front of witnesses and any Guardian / Wali to relieve myself of any sin.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
It is not permissible for a man to marry a woman without the permission of her guardian, whether she is a virgin or previously-married. This is the view of the majority of scholars, including al-Shaafa’i, Maalik and Ahmad. This is based on evidence which includes the following: 
The verses in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“do not prevent them from marrying their (former) husbands”
[al-Baqarah 2:232] 
“And do not marry Al-Mushrikaat (idolatresses) till they believe (worship Allaah Alone)”
[al-Baqarah 2:221] 
“and marry those among you who are single”
[al-Noor 24:32]
The point here is that these verses clearly stipulate that there be a guardian in marriage, because Allaah is addressing the guardian with regard to the marriage of the woman under his care. If the matter were up to her and not him, there would be no need to address him. 
It is indicative of Imam al-Bukhaari’s deep understanding of issues of sharee’ah that he quoted these verses in a chapter which he entitled “Baab man qaala la nikaaha illa bi wali (Chapter on those who say that there is no marriage without a guardian).” 
It was narrated that Abu Moosa said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no marriage without a guardian.”
(Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1101; Abu Dawood, 2085; Ibn Maajah, 1881. Classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 1/318) 
It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Any woman who gets married without the permission of her guardian, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid. But if the marriage is consummated then the mahr is hers because she has allowed him to be intimate with her. If they dispute, then the ruler is the guardian of the one who has no guardian.” 
(Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1102; Abu Dawood, 2083; Ibn Maajah, 1879. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel, 1840) 
Secondly: If her guardian prevents her from marrying the person she wants for no valid reason according to sharee’ah, then the role of guardian passes to the next closest relative, so it passes from the father to the grandfather, for example. 
Thirdly: if all of her guardians prevent her from getting married for no valid reason according to sharee’ah, then the ruler is her guardian, because of the hadeeth quoted above (“…If they dispute, then the ruler is the guardian of the one who has no guardian”) 
Fourthly: if there is no guardian and no ruler, then her marriage is to be arranged by a man who has authority in the place where she is, such as the head of a village, or the governor of a province, and so on. If there is no such person, then she should appoint a trustworthy Muslim man to arrange her marriage. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
If there is no relative who can act as her guardian, then the position of guardian passes to the one who is most fit among those who have any kind of authority in matters other than marriage, such as the head of a village, the leader of a caravan, and so on. 
Al-Ikhtiyaaraat, p. 350. 
Ibn Qudaamah said: If a woman does not have a guardian and there is no ruler, then there was narrated from Ahmad that which indicates that her marriage should be arranged by a man of sound character, with her permission. 
Al-Mughni, 9/362. 
Shaykh ‘Umar al-Ashqar said: 
If there is no ruler of the Muslims, or if the woman is in a place where the Muslims have no ruler, and she has no guardian at all, like the Muslims in America and elsewhere, if there are Islamic institutions in that country that take care of the Muslims’ affairs, then they should arrange her marriage. The same applies if the Muslims have a leader who is in charge or someone who is responsible for their affairs.  
Al-Waadih fi Sharh Qanoon al-Ahwaal al-Shakhsiyyah al-Urduni, p. 70 
The marriage contract must be witnessed by two adult male Muslims of sound mind. See question no. 2127.  
Hence you have to repeat your marriage contract, and it is essential that the woman’s guardian be present, as stated above, as well as two witnesses.
