39172,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39172,Varying and combining the adhkaar to be recited when bowing,"A number of adhkaar have been narrated to be recited when bowing, such as “Subhaan Allaah al-‘Azeem wa bi hamdihi (Glory and praise be to Allaah the most Great)” and “Subbooh Quddoos Rabb al-Malaa’ikah wa’l-Rooh (Glorified, Holy, Lord of the Angels and of the Rooh)” and “Allaahumma laka raka’tu … (O Allaah, to You have I bowed…)”. Is it permissible to combine two of these kinds of adhkaar when bowing, such as saying, “Subhaan Rabbiy al-‘Azeem (Glory be to my Lord Most Great” three times then saying, “Subbooh Quddoos Rabb al-Malaa’ikah wa’l-Rooh (Glorified, Holy, Lord of the Angels and of the Rooh)” three times?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    The following reports have been narrated concerning the 
    adhkaar to be recited when bowing: 

    1 – Saying “Subhaana Rabbiy al-‘Azeem (Glory be to my 
    Lord Most Great)”, because of the report narrated by Muslim (772) from 
    Hudhayfah (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: 

    I prayed with the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) one night… then he bowed and he started saying: “Subhaana 
    Rabbiy al-‘Azeem (Glory be to my Lord Most Great).” 

    2 – Saying “Subhaana Rabbiy al-‘Azeem wa bi hamdihi 
    (Glory and praise be to my Lord Most Great)”, because of the report narrated 
    by Abu Dawood from ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Aamir (may Allaah be pleased with him) who 
    said: 

    When the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) bowed, he would say: “Subhaana Rabbiy al-‘Azeem wa bi 
    hamdihi (Glory and praise be to my Lord Most Great)” three times, and 
    when he prostrated he would say: “Subhaana Rabbiy al-A’laa wa bi hamdihi 
    (Glory and praise be to my Lord Most High)” three times.

    Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Sifat al-Salaah, p. 
    133. 

    3 – Saying “Subbooh Quddoos Rabb ul-Malaa’ikah wa’l-Rooh 
    (Glorified, Holy, Lord of the Angels and of the Rooh)” because of the report 
    narrated by Muslim (487) from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her), 
    according to which the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) used to say when bowing and prostrating: “Subbooh 
    Quddoos Rabb ul-Malaa’ikah wa’l-Rooh (Glorified, Holy, Lord of the 
    Angels and of the Rooh)”. 

    4 – Saying: “Subhaanaka Allaahumma Rabbana wa bihamdika, 
    Allaahumma ighfir li (Glory and praise be to You, O Allaah our Lord; O 
    Allaah, forgive me)” because of the report narrated by al-Bukhaari (794) and 
    Muslim (484) from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) who said:

    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    used to say when bowing and prostrating: “Subhaanaka Allaahumma Rabbana 
    wa bihamdika, Allaahumma ighfir li (Glory and praise be to You, O Allaah 
    our Lord; O Allaah, forgive me)”. 

    5 – Saying, “Allaahumma laka raka’tu wa bika aamantu … 
    (O Allaah, to You have I bowed and in You have I believed…)” because of the 
    report narrated by Muslim (771) from ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) , according to which when the Messenger of Allaah  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) bowed, he would say: “Allaahumma 
    laka raka’tu wa bika aamantu wa laka aslamtu, khasha’a laka sam’i wa basari 
    wa mukhkhi wa ‘azmi wa ‘asabi (O Allaah, to You have I bowed and in You 
    have I believed and to You have I submitted; my hearing, my sight, my brain, 
    my bones and my sinews submit to You).” 

    Secondly: 

    The Muslim should preserve these Sunnahs that have been 
    narrated from the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him), so he should say one of them sometimes and another of them sometimes. 
    And he may combine all these adhkaar in one bowing. 

    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in 
    al-Adhkaar (p. 86): But it is better to combine all of these adhkaar if 
    that is possible without causing hardship to anyone else, and he should 
    recite the tasbeehs first (those that start with the words Subhaan Allaah). 
    If he wants to keep it short then it is mustahabb to say tasbeeh, and the 
    minimum required is to say tasbeeh three times, but if he says it only once 
    he will have done what is basically required for tasbeeh. If he wants to 
    limit it to only some of the adhkaar, it is mustahabb to say some of them 
    sometimes and others at other times and so on, so that he will have done all 
    of them. End quote. 

    It says in al-Iqnaa’, which is a Hanbali book (1/119): 
    It is not makrooh to add something to the phrases “Rabb ighfir li 
    (Lord forgive me) or to say more than “Subhaana Rabbiy al-‘Azeem 
    (Glory be to my Lord Most Great)” and “Subhaana Rabbiy al-‘Ala (Glory 
    be to my Lord Most High)” when bowing and prostrating. End quote 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’ (3/77), after mentioning a number of adhkaar to be said when bowing and raising the question as to whether these adhkaar may be combined or one should recite only one of them: 

    This is possible. We have stated above that not all of the opening du’aa’s that have been narrated should be said at once, rather we should say one of them sometimes and another at other times, and we have quoted the evidence for that. But with regard to the adhkaar for bowing which are known to most of the scholars, they may all be recited together. End quote.",Islam Q&A
39174,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39174,Is Wiping The Face after Du`a Sunnah?,"What is the ruling on wiping the face and body with the hands after making Du`a, and kissing the eyes?","Wiping the face with the hands after making Du`a is not prescribed in Islam, because the Hadiths that have been narrated concerning that are inauthentic.",,"Praise be to Allah.It is not prescribed to wipe the face after making Du`a . There are many Hadiths which describe how the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) called upon his Lord in Du`a, and there is no proven report that he used to wipe his face after making Du`a . 
Those who say that the face should be wiped quoted some Hadiths as evidence, but upon further examination they are not authentic, and do not support one another. 
As for the views of the scholars who say that it is not allowed to wipe the face, they include the following: 

Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is not known that anyone used to wipe his face after making Du`a except Al-Hasan. (Al-`Ilal Al-Mutanahiyah, 2/840, 841) 
Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “With regard to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) raising his hands when saying Du`a , there are many authentic Hadiths concerning this. However, regarding wiping his face with his hands, there are only one or two Hadiths concerning that, and they cannot be taken as evidence.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 22/519) 
Al-`Izz ibn `Abd As-Salam (may Allah have mercy on him) said: No one wipes his face with his hands after saying Du`a except one who is ignorant. (Fatawa Al-`Izz ibn `Abd As-Salam, p. 47) 

If it is not permitted to wipe the face after making Du`a , it is more likely that the person who says Du`a should not be allowed to wipe his body either, or to kiss his eyes. 
Rather the scholars stated that kissing the thumbs and placing them on the eyes is a Bid`ah that was introduced by some of the Sufi Orders, and there is a Hadith concerning that which is falsely attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
Shaykh Muhammad ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about the ruling on wiping the face with the hands after making Du`a. 
He replied: 
“Wiping the face with the hands after making Du`a is more likely to be not prescribed in Islam, because the Hadiths that have been narrated concerning that are weak. Shaykh Al-Islam (may Allah have mercy on him) said: They cannot be used as evidence. If we are not certain or we think it most likely that this is not prescribed, then it is better not to do it, because Islamic rulings cannot be proven on the basis of mere conjecture, unless we believe it to be mostly likely to be the case. 
What I think about wiping the face with the hands after Du`a is that it is not Sunnah. As is well known, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed for rain during his Friday khutbah and raised his hands, but it is not narrated that he wiped his face with them. Similarly in a number of Hadiths it says that the Prophet raised his hands, but there is no proof that he wiped his face.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn `Uthaymin, 14/question no. 781)

39175,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39175,Paying off a father’s debt from zakaah,Is it permissible to pay off a father’s debt from zakaah?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    If the father took on this debt in order to spend on himself, 
    it is not permissible for his son to give his zakaah to his father to pay 
    off his debt, because the son is obliged to spend on his father. 
But if this debt was for 
    something else other than spending on himself, then there is nothing wrong 
    with the son paying it off with zakaah, because he is not obliged to pay off 
    his father’s debt, so he is not avoiding an obligatory duty by doing so. 

    Shaykh Ibn Baaz said: 

    Paying zakaah to relatives who are entitled to it is better 
    than giving it to those who are not your relatives, because charity given to 
    relatives is both charity and upholding the ties of kinship, unless these 
    relatives are those on whom you are obliged to spend, in which case giving 
    zakaah to them in order to free yourself from the obligation to spend on 
    them is not permissible. If it so happens that these brothers and sisters 
    whom you have mentioned are poor, and you cannot afford to spend on them, 
    then there is nothing wrong with you giving them your zakaah. Similarly, if 
    these brothers and sisters owe debts to people and you pay off their debts 
    with your zakaah, there is nothing wrong with you doing that. That is 
    because a person is not obliged to pay off the debts of his relative, so if 
    he pays them off with his zakaah, that is something for which he will be 
    rewarded. Even if it is your son or father who owes a debt to someone and 
    cannot pay it off, it is permissible for you to pay off your father’s debt 
    from your zakaah, i.e., it is permissible for you to pay off your father’s 
    debt from your zakaah and it is permissible to pay off the debt of your son 
    from your zakaah, so long as the reason for this debt is not to obtain money 
    for maintenance that it is your duty to pay. If the reason for it is to 
    obtain maintenance which it is your duty to pay, then it is not permissible 
    for you to pay off the debt from your zakaah, lest you use that as a trick 
    to get out of spending on those on whom you are obliged to spend so that 
    they can take on debts and you can pay them off with your zakaah. End 
    quote. 

    Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn Baaz, 
    14/310 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
If you are obliged to 
    spend on someone, it is not permissible for you to give zakaah to him as 
    maintenance, but if it is to pay off his debt, there is nothing wrong with 
    that. If we assume that a father owes a debt, and his son wants to pay off 
    his debt from his zakaah, and (the father) is unable to pay it off, there is 
    nothing wrong with that. The same applies to a mother or a son. But if you 
    are giving zakaah for the purpose of maintenance, that is not permissible, 
    because by doing this you are saving your money, but it is obligatory to 
    spend on one's parents, mother and father, and on sons and daughters, and on 
    everyone from whom you would inherit if he died, i.e., everyone from whom 
    you would inherit if he died, you are obliged to spend on, because Allaah 
    says (interpretation of the meaning):

    “And on the (father’s) heir is 
    incumbent the like of that (which was incumbent on the father)”

    [al-Baqarah 2:233]
Allaah has enjoined upon 
    the heir the payment for breastfeeding, because breastfeeding is like

39176,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39176,Joining Maghrib and ‘Isha’ because of the curfew,"We are in Iraq and in our city there is a curfew which starts at 10 p.m. The imam of our mosque does not have much knowledge of fiqh, and he has started to combine Maghrib and ‘Isha’. He prays Maghrib with three rak’ahs then he prays ‘Isha’ with four rak'ahs immediately after Maghrib, then after that he gives the adhaan for ‘Isha’ prayer at the time for ‘Isha’.

 Is this action of his in accordance with the Qur’aan and Sunnah, or what? What is the proper manner of performing the fear prayer according to sharee’ah? 

Please advise us, may Allaah reward you.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    Yes, in your situation it is permissible to combine Maghrib 
    and ‘Isha’ prayers. It is narrated in the Sunnah that the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to join Maghrib and ‘Isha’ 
    prayers because of rain. Muslim (705) narrated from Sa’eed ibn Jubayr that 
    Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) joined Zuhr and ‘Asr, and 
    Maghrib and ‘Isha’ in Madeenah at times other than times of fear or rain. I 
    said to Ibn ‘Abbaas: Why did he do that? He said: So that his ummah would 
    not be faced with hardship. 

    The fact that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) 
    stated that it was not because of fear or rain indicates that these are 
    two of the reasons for joining prayers. 

    Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah] said:  

    It is permissible to combine the two evening prayers because 
    of rain, strong cold winds or muddy conditions and the like, and this is the 
    more correct scholarly view. This is the view of the madhhabs of Ahmad, 
    Maalik and others.  

    And he said: It is permissible to combine prayers in the case 
    of severely muddy conditions or severe cold wind on a dark night, etc, even 
    if rain is not actually falling, according to the more sound of the two 
    scholarly opinions. That is better than praying in one's home, because not 
    joining the prayers in the mosque and praying at home instead is an 
    innovation that is contrary to the Sunnah. The Sunnah is to offer the five 
    daily prayers in the mosque in congregation, and that is better than praying 
    at home, according to the consensus of the Muslims. Joining the prayers in 
    the mosque is better than praying them separately at home according to the 
    consensus of those imams who regard joining the prayers as permissible, such 
    as Maalik and al-Shaafa’i. End quote. 

    Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 24/30 
In your situation, the 
    reason for joining the prayers is undoubtedly more pressing than rain. 

    Secondly: 
Joining the prayers in 
    this case applies to those who are required to pray in congregation. As for 
    sick people who pray at home, or women who pray at home, it is not 
    permissible for them to join their prayers. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 
    4/288 

    But if a person prays at home because of sickness and does 
    not attend the mosque, then it is not permissible for him to join the 
    prayers, because that will not benefit him. Similarly a woman is not 
    permitted to join her prayers because of rain, because she will not benefit 
    from doing so, as she is not one of those who are required to pray in 
    congregation. End quote. 

    See also the answer to question no.
    31172. 

    Thirdly: 

    With regard to his giving the adhaan for ‘Isha’ at the time 
    for ‘Isha’, there is nothing wrong with that, so that those who are praying 
    at home, such as women and the sick, will know that the time for ‘Isha’ 
    prayer has begun. 

    Fourthly: 

    Your describing the imam of your mosque as not having much 
    knowledge of fiqh because he joins Maghrib and ‘Isha’ would seem to be a 
    mistake, as you now know that this action of his is correct, based on the 
    evidence noted above. 

    You should have been easygoing and not hastened to denounce 
    something until you knew whether it was wrong. You should not attribute 
    ignorance to your brother without proof. 

    Fifthly: 

    The fear prayer may be done in several ways, according to the 
    situation and whether the enemy is in the direction of the qiblah or not. We 
    have explained that in the answer to question no

    Firstly: 

    It is clear from your question that you work in a place where 
    there is mixing with men. Mixing leads to many evils and things that are 
    forbidden, as is clear to anyone who has insight. Please see question no. 
    1200 for the evidence that mixing is haraam.  

    Trustworthy scholars have issued fatwas ruling that it is 
    haraam to work in mixed environments, such as the statement in Fataawa 
    al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (12/156): Mixing between men and women in schools 
    and elsewhere is a great evil which has a serious impact on one's religious 
    commitment and worldly interests. It is not permissible for a woman to study 
    or work in a place where there is mixing between men and women, and it is 
    not permissible for her guardian to give her permission to do that. End 
    quote. 

    Please see question no. 6666: Should she carry on working in 
    a job where she mixes with men? 

    Secondly: 

    For a woman who is faced with this problem of working in a 
    mixed environment, if she can pray in her house, that is better, such as if 
    she can go back home long enough before ‘Asr that she can perform Zuhr 
    prayer. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “A woman’s prayer in her house is better than her prayer in her courtyard, 
    and her prayer in her chamber is better than her prayer in her house.” 
    Narrated by Abu Dawood, 570; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh 
    Abi Dawood. That is because it is more concealing and protects 
    her from the gaze of men. 

    If she does not have time to offer the prayer in her house, 
    then she should choose the most concealed place in her workplace, and offer 
    her prayer there, wearing full hijab and covering all of her body. It is not 
    permissible for her to delay her prayer until the time for it is over. 
    Allaah, may He be exalted, says:  

    “Verily, As‑Salaah (the prayer) is enjoined on the 
    believers at fixed hours”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:103]

    Al-Sa’di (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:  
i.e., it is enjoined at 
    the proper time. This indicates that it is obligatory and that it has its 
    own time, and it is not valid unless done at that time. These are the times 
    agreed upon by the Muslims, young and old, knowledgeable and ignorant. They 
    learned that from their Prophet Muhammad  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him), who said: “Pray as you have seen me praying.” End quote. 

    Tafseer al-Sa’di, 17/255 

    The free woman is ‘awrah and it is haraam for her to uncover 
    her face and hands in the presence of non-mahram men, whether she is praying 
    or in the state of ihraam or in any other normal situation, because of the 
    report narrated by ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) who said: The 
    riders used to pass by us when we were with the Messenger of Allaah  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in ihraam. When they drew level 
    with us, one of us would lower her jilbaab from her head over her face, and 
    when they had passed by us, we would uncover it. Narrated by Ahmad, Abu 
    Dawood and Ibn Maajah. If this was done in the case of ihraam when a woman 
    is required to uncover her face, then it is more important in other cases, 
    because of the general meaning of the verse in which Allaah, may He be 
    exalted, says: 

    “And when you ask (his wives) for anything you want, ask 
    them from behind a screen, that is purer for your hearts and for their 
    hearts”

    [al-Ahzaab 33:53]

    It should be noted that whoever gives up something for the 
    sake of Allaah, Allaah will compensate him with something better than it, 
    and whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for 
    him to get out (from every difficulty) And He will provide him from 
    (sources) he never could imagine (cf. al-Talaaq 65:2-3). So hasten to give 
    up working in a mixed environment, and look for permissible work that Allaah 
    will bless.

The words of al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) – “whether it he was sitting firmly on his backside or not” – mean: whether he was sitting firmly on his backside on the ground, on the basis that he will not invalidate his wudu if he is sitting firmly on his backside on the ground. In the answer to question no 36889 , we have stated that the correct view concerning the invalidation of wudu by sleep is that if the sleep is deep, it invalidates wudu, and if it is light it does not do so. 
The evidence that sleep does not invalidate wudu in the case of uncertainty as to whether anything that invalidates it has happened is the report narrated by al-Bukhaari (137) and Muslim (361) from ‘Abbaad ibn Tameem from his paternal uncle, who said: A complaint was made to the Prophet (S) about when one thinks that something has happened whilst he praying. He said: “Do not stop until you hear a sound or notice a smell. 
And Muslim (362) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (S) said: “If one of you feels something in his stomach and is not sure whether something came out of him or not, let him not leave the mosque unless he hears a sound or notices a smell.” 
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Sharh Muslim: 
The words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “unless he hears a sound or notices a smell” mean: unless he is certain that one of them has happened. It is not essential that he both hear and smell it, according to the consensus of the Muslims. 
This hadeeth is one of the basic principles of Islam and one of the most important principles of fiqh, which is that things are assumed to remain as they originally were, unless there is proof to the contrary, and mere doubt does not change anything. 
An example of that is the issue which is mentioned in the hadeeth: which is that a person who is certain that he has purified himself and is not sure whether that purity had been broken is ruled to still be in a state of purity, and it makes no difference whether this doubt occurs during the prayer or outside of prayer. This is our view and the view of the majority of scholars of the earlier and later generations. 
Our companions said: It makes no difference whether the probability of the wudu being broken and the probability of it not being broken are equal, or one of them is more likely, or he thinks that one of them is more likely. He does not have to do wudu in any case.

    is the angels’ entering that house. It was narrated from Abu Sa’eed

    which there are statues or images.” Narrated by Imam Ahmad; Saheeh 
    al-Jaami’, 1961.

39186,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39186,Ruling on a woman performing the adhaan,What is the ruling on a woman performing the adhan for men?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.For fourteen hundred years the custom among the Muslims has been that the adhan has not been performed by anyone except men. This alone should be sufficient evidence that women are not allowed to perform the adhan for men. Going against this is going against the way of the believers. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger (Muhammad) after the right path has been shown clearly to him, and follows other than the believers’ way, We shall keep him in the path he has chosen, and burn him in Hell — what an evil destination!” [al-Nisa’ 4:115]
The matter would be too clear to need any evidence or argument, were it not for the fact that there are people whose eyes have been sealed by Allah and who are arguing about matters that should be regarded as firmly-established aspects of this religion. 
The evidence for that from the Sunnah is as follows: 
1 – al-Bukhari (604) and Muslim (377) narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: When the Muslims came to Madeenah, they used to gather and wait for the prayer, and there was no call for the prayer. One day they spoke about that and some of them said, “Let us use a bell like the bell of the Christians.” Others said, “No, let us use a horn like the horn of the Jews.” ‘Umar said, “Why don’t you send a man to give the call to prayer?” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “O Bilaal, get up and call the people to prayer.” 
This hadeeth indicates that the decision of the Sahaabah was that no one should give the call to prayer except men, and there is no room for women to do that, because ‘Umar said, “Why don’t you send a man to give the call to prayer?” 
2 – al-Bukhari (684) and Muslim (421) narrated from Sahl ibn Sa’d al-Saa’idi (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever notices anything amiss during the prayer, let him say tasbeeh, for if he does so it will be noticed; and clapping is only for women.” 
al-Haafiz said: 
It is as if women are not allowed to say tasbeeh because they are enjoined to keep their voices low in prayer at all times, because of the fear of fitnah. End quote. 
If women are forbidden to alert the imam by speaking if he makes a mistake, and should clap instead, so that they will not raise their voices in the presence of men, then how can it be allowed for a woman to give the adhan? 
The scholars are agreed that it is not prescribed for women to give the adhan for men. There follow some of their comments on this topic: 
It says in Badaa’i’ al-Sanaa’i’ (1/411) (Hanafi): 
It is not allowed for a woman to give the adhan, according to all the reports. 
It says in Mawaahib al-Jaleel (2/87) (Maaliki): 
The adhan of a woman is not valid. End quote. 
Al-Shaafa’i said in al-Umm (1/84): 
A woman should not give the call to prayer, and if she gives the adhan for men, her adhan is not valid (and they should repeat it). End quote.

39187,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39187,The ahaadeeth about the Mahdi and the descent of ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) are not a reason to stop striving,"Some people take the ahaadeeth about the Mahdi and the descent of ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) as a reason to stop striving for Islam, so they sit and wait for the emergence of the Mahdi or the descent of ‘Eesa, so that Islam and the Muslims will rise once again. What is your opinion of this understanding?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    This miserable situation in which the Muslim ummah is today 
    is one that is disgraceful, and every Muslim is responsible for setting 
    things straight. But some Muslims fail to strive, relying on hope and 
    avoiding doing anything to set the ummah’s situation straight, on the 
    grounds that it was caused by those who came before us and will be set right 
    by those who come after us. So they fail to strive to support the religion 
    of Allaah, on the basis that the Mahdi is the one who will do that. 

    This is resorting to hope without implementing the means that 
    are prescribed in Islam. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “It will not be in accordance with your desires (Muslims), 
    nor those of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), whosoever 
    works evil, will have the recompense thereof, and he will not find any 
    protector or helper besides Allaah”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:123]
This negativity from 
    which some Muslims are suffering nowadays is not something that could be 
    prescribed by the Islamic texts, rather it is a misunderstanding, 
    incapability and laziness, and an evasion of responsibility. 

    Allaah has commanded the Muslims to strive for this religion 
    and to call people to it, to debate with the kuffaar and invite them to 
    Islam with wisdom and beautiful preaching, and to fight them until there is 
    no longer any shirk on earth. Allaah says (Interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And fight them until there is no more Fitnah (disbelief 
    and polytheism, i.e. worshipping others besides Allaah), and the religion 
    (worship) will all be for Allaah Alone [in the whole of the world]. But if 
    they cease (worshipping others besides Allaah), then certainly, Allaah is 
    All-Seer of what they do”

    [al-Anfaal 8:39]
Ibn Katheer (may Allaah 
    have mercy on him) said: 

    Here Allaah commands us to fight the kuffaar “until there 
    is no more Fitnah” i.e., shirk, “and the religion (worship) will all 
    be for Allaah alone” i.e., the religion of Allaah will be the one that 
    prevails over all other religions. End quote. 

    This command is not specific to any particular time or place, 
    rather the Muslims at all times and in all places are commanded to do this. 
    Undoubtedly striving for Islam and supporting it on earth require the 
    Muslims to work hard, strive hard and implement all means that will lead to 
    that. 

    Some people misunderstand the ahaadeeth which speak of the 
    emergence of the Mahdi or the descent of the Messiah ‘Eesa ibn Maryam (peace 
    be upon him) and they become apathetic, and they sit waiting for the 
    emergence of the Mahdi or the descent of the Messiah, and they stop calling 
    people to Allaah and striving to make the word of Allaah supreme. But 
    Allaah, may He be exalted, and His Messenger  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) have commanded us to implement the means and strive on 
    this earth.  

    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “O you who believe! Take your precautions, and either go 
    forth (on an expedition) in parties, or go forth all together”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:71] 

    “And make ready against them all you can of power, 
    including steeds of war (tanks, planes, missiles, artillery) to threaten the 
    enemy of Allaah and your enemy”

    [al-Anfaal 8:60]

    “He it is Who has made the earth subservient to you (i.e. 
    easy for you to walk, to live and to do agriculture on it); so walk in the 
    path thereof and eat of His provision. And to Him will be the Resurrection”

    [al-Mulk 67:15] 
“and for this let (all) 
    those strive who want to strive (i.e. hasten earnestly to the obedience of 
    Allaah)”

    [al-Mutaffifeen 83:26]

    “For the like of this let the workers work”

    [al-Saaffaat 37:61] 
“And whoever desires the 
    Hereafter and strives for it, with the necessary effort due for it (i.e. 
    does righteous deeds of Allaah’s obedience) while he is a believer (in the 
    Oneness of Allaah  
    Islamic Monotheism) — then such are the ones whose striving shall be 
    appreciated, (thanked and rewarded by Allaah)”
    [al-Isra’ 17:19]

    “And take a provision (with you) for the journey, but the 
    best provision is At-Taqwa (piety, righteousness)”

    [al-Baqarah 2:197]

    The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) used to make preparations for everything, drawing up a plan, as 
    happened during the hijrah, when he prepared mounts and a guide, and chose a 
    traveling-companion, and he decided on a place to hide until the pursuit had 
    cooled down, and he shrouded all of that in secrecy. This is how he acted in 
    all his campaigns, and this is how he trained his noble companions. They 
    used to prepare themselves with all kinds of weapons. The Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) entered Makkah with 
    his helmet on his head, although Allaah had said (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “Allaah will protect you from mankind”

    [al-Maa'idah 5:67] 
And when he traveled for 
    jihad or Hajj or ‘Umrah, he took his provisions with him. 

    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said: “Strive for that which will benefit you, and seek the help of Allaah, 
    and do not be helpless.” Narrated by Muslim, 2664.  

    We can imagine what the fate of the da’wah and the ummah 
    would have been if the previous generations had heeded the calls to give up 
    until the Mahdi emerges. Would they have defeated the Tatars and crusaders, 
    or conquered Constantinople? 

    This misunderstanding of the Islamic texts which speak about 
    the Mahdi and the Messiah (peace be upon him) has been refuted by many 
    scholars, daa’iyahs and writers. 

    Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    It is not permissible for the Muslims to ignore striving for 
    Islam and the establishment of an Islamic state on earth, waiting for the 
    emergence of the Mahdi and the descent of ‘Eesa (peace be upon them), out of 
    despair or imagining that that is not possible before they come. This is a 
    false notion and false despair. Allaah and His Messenger  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not tell us that Islam will not return 
    or regain power on earth except at their time. It is possible to achieve 
    that before they come, if the Muslims implement the means of doing that, 
    because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “O you who believe! If you help (in the cause of) Allaah, 
    He will help you, and make your foothold firm”

    [Muhammad 47:7] 

    “Verily, Allaah will help those who help His (Cause)”

    [al-Hajj 22:40]
With regard to the 
    ahaadeeth which speak of the descent of ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) etc., it 
    is obligatory to believe in them, and to refute those who think that they 
    mean we should not strive, and to prepare to do whatever must be done at any 
    time and in any place. End quote. 

    Professor ‘Abd al-‘Azeez Mustafa said: 

    Striving in jihad against the kuffaar, no matter who they are 
    and no matter where they are and no matter in what time they are, is 
    obligatory according to sharee’ah, and this has not been abrogated. This is 
    an established Islamic truth. This jihad is obligatory if the conditions for 
    it are met and if the guidelines and rulings concerning it apply. It is not 
    one of these conditions, guidelines or rulings that jihad should be delayed 
    until the prediction (about the Mahdi and the Messiah) is fulfilled, and 
    this is not how the first Muslims understood it or acted. When they were 
    told that Allaah would break the power of Chosroes with their swords, they 
    did not hide in their houses waiting for that prediction to come true and 
    for it to come to pass without them making any effort; rather they made 
    preparations for that until victory came to pass. Thus the consequences of 
    obeying the command of Allaah (i.e., to fight the kuffaar) coincided with 
    the decree of Allaah (i.e., that their kingdom should be destroyed). But 
    some Muslims nowadays say: No, jihad against the Jews should not happen 
    until the Dajjaal appears. Perhaps this is part of the fitnah of the Dajjaal 
    in this world. 

    This foolish notion has taken hold of some Muslim youth, and 
    they have refused to take any responsibility with regard to al-Masjid 
    al-Aqsa, the environs of which Allaah has blessed. An even more foolish 
    notion has taken hold of them, which is that the Islamic state and the 
    caliphate can never be established until the Mahdi emerges. 

    It is a very strange idea. By their actions it is as if they 
    are saying to the Jews: Treat your enemies harshly, and saying to the 
    Christians: Continue with your wrongdoing… and to the Muslims: Continue with 
    your division and conflicts… until the Mahdi emerges. I do not know on what 
    evidence they have fallen into this error and why they imagine that the 
    Mahdi will emerge to people who are doing nothing or that apathetic people 
    will support him. 

    We ask Allaah to bring the Muslims back to their religion. 

    And Allaah knows best.

39188,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39188,Can Women Lead Men in Prayer?,What is the ruling on a woman leading men in Jumu`ah and other prayers?,"It is not permissible for a woman to lead a man in prayer and his prayer offered behind her is not valid, because of a great deal of evidence to that effect, and the man must repeat his prayer.","Can women lead men in prayer?


Did the Prophet give Umm Waraqah permission to lead her household in prayer?","Praise be to Allah.Can women lead men in prayer?
Allah has singled out men for some virtues and rulings, and He has singled out women for other virtues and rulings. It is not permissible for any man to wish for that which has been granted to women only, nor is it permissible for any woman to wish for that which has been granted to men. This kind of wishing is tantamount to objecting to the laws and rulings of Allah. 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And wish not for the things in which Allah has made some of you to excel others. For men there is reward for what they have earned, (and likewise) for women there is reward for what they have earned, and ask Allah of His Bounty. Surely, Allah is Ever All-Knower of everything” [An-Nisa’ 4:32]
As-Sa’di (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Allah forbids the believers to wish for that with which Allah has favoured others, whether that is in things that are possible or things that are impossible. Women should not wish for the things that have been bestowed uniquely upon men, by which Allah has favoured them over women, and no poor person or person who has shortcomings should merely wish for the position of one who is rich or perfect, because this is the essence of destructive envy (Hasad)… and because that implies displeasure with the decree of Allah.”
One of the things for which Allah has singled out men is that the acts of worship which require physical strength, such as Jihad, or require a position of leadership such as leading the prayers, etc., are only for men, and women have nothing to do with them. 
This is indicated by a great deal of evidence, such as the following: 

Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“Men are the protectors and maintainers of women , because Allah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means.” [An-Nisa’ 4:34]
Ash-Shafi`i (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Umm (1/191): 
“If a woman leads men , women and boys in prayer, then the prayer of the women is valid and the prayer of the men and boys is invalid, because Allah has given men the role of protectors and maintainers of women, and He has not allowed them to be in charge, so it is not permissible for a woman to lead a man in prayer under any circumstances, ever.”
 Al-Sa’di (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Men have been favoured over women in numerous ways, such as the fact that positions of leadership and Prophethood are limited to men only, and many acts of worship, such as Jihad and leading the `Eid prayers and Jumu`ah prayers, are for men only, and Allah has favoured them with intellect, wisdom, patience and toughness which women do not share.”

Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“And they (women) have rights (over their husbands as regards living expenses) similar (to those of their husbands) over them (as regards obedience and respect) to what is reasonable, but men have a degree (of responsibility) over them. And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise” [Al-Baqarah 2:228]
Al-Sa’di (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“‘but men have a degree over them’ means higher status and leadership, and more rights over them, as Allah says, “Men are the protectors and maintainers of women”. The position of Prophet and judge, leading the prayers and leading the state, and all positions of authority, are restricted to men.”

Al-Bukhari (4425) narrated that Abu Bakrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No people will ever succeed who appoint a woman as their leader.” 

This Hadith indicates that it is not permissible for a woman to hold a position of public authority, and leading the prayers is a position of public authority. 

Abu Dawud (567) and Ahmad (5445) narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not prevent your women from attending the mosques , although their houses are better for them .” (Classed as authentic by Al-Albani in Sunan Abu Dawud)

It says in `Awn Al-Ma`bud: 
“‘although their houses are better for them’ means: their praying in their houses is better for them than their praying in the mosques, if only they knew, but they do not know that, and they ask for permission to go out to the mosques, because they think that the reward for them in the mosque is greater. The reason why their praying at home is better is that there is no danger of Fitnah (temptation). That was confirmed after women began to wear adornments.”

Muslim (440) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The best rows for men are those are the front and the worst are those at the back, and the best rows for women are those at the back and the worst are those at the front.” 

An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“The phrase “the rows for men” is to be understood in general terms as meaning that the best of them are those that are at the front, and the worst are those at the back, and that is always the case. As for the rows for women, what is meant in this Hadith is the rows of women who are praying with men. But if women are praying on their own and not with men, then they are like men and the best rows are those at the front and the worst are those at the back. What is meant by the worst rows for both men and women is that they bring less reward, are lower in status and are further removed from what is required by Shari`ah. And the best rows are the opposite of that. The virtue of the last row for women who are praying with men is that they are farther away from mixing with men or seeing them or becoming attracted to them when seeing their movements or hearing their words and so on. The first rows are condemned for the opposite of that. And Allah knows best.”
If a woman is enjoined to pray in her house and keep away from men, and the worst rows for women are the front rows, because they are closer to the men, then how can it be befitting for Islam to allow a woman to pray as an imam, leading men in prayer, when it enjoins her to keep away from men? 

Al-Bukhari (684) and Muslim (421) narrated from Sahl ibn Sa’d As-Sa’idi (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Whoever notices anything amiss during the prayer, let him say Tasbih, for if he does so it will be noticed; and clapping is only for women.” 

Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“It is as if women are not allowed to say Tasbih because they are enjoined to keep their voices low in prayer at all times, because of the fear of Fitnah.”
If women are forbidden to alert the Imam by speaking if he makes a mistake, and should clap instead, so that they will not raise their voice in the presence of men, then how can it be allowed for a woman to lead them in prayer and deliver a Khutbah to them? 

Muslim (658) narrated from Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) that he prayed behind the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and with him was his grandmother and an orphan. He said: The orphan and I stood in a row behind him, and the old woman stood behind us. 

Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“This shows that a woman should not stand in a row with a man. The basic reason is that there is the fear of Fitnah because of her.”
If a woman should stand on her own behind the rows, and not stand in the same row as the men , how can she stand in front of them and lead them in prayer? 
It says in ‘Awn Al-Ma’bud: 
“This indicates that it is not permissible for a woman to lead men in prayer , because if she is not allowed to stand in the same row as them, it is less likely that she should be allowed to stand in front of them.”  

According to the actions of the Muslims throughout fourteen hundred years, no woman should be allowed to lead men in prayer. (Bada’i` Al-Sana’i`, 2/289)

Whoever goes against this is following a path other than that of the believers. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger (Muhammad) after the right path has been shown clearly to him, and follows other than the believers’ way, We shall keep him in the path he has chosen, and burn him in Hell — what an evil destination!.” [An-Nisa’ 4:115]
There follow some comments of the scholars: 
It says in Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah (6/205): 
“In order to lead men in prayers, it is essential that the Imam be a male; it is not valid for a woman to lead men in prayers. The jurists unanimously agreed on this matter.”
Ibn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Maratib Al-Ijma`, p. 27 
“They are unanimously agreed that a woman should not lead men in prayer when they know that she is a woman. If they do that then their prayer is invalid, according to scholarly consensus.”
It says in Al-Muhalla (2/167): 
“It is not permissible for a woman to lead a man or men in prayer. There is no difference of scholarly opinion on this point. Moreover the text states that a woman invalidates a man’s prayer if she walks in front of him… The ruling of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is that she should definitely stand behind the man in prayer, and the imam must stand in front of the congregation or with one who is praying with him in the same row… From these texts it may be established that it is definitely invalid for a woman to lead a man or men in prayer.”
An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Majmu` (4/152): 
“Our companions agreed that it is not permissible for an adult man or a boy to pray behind a woman… the prohibition on a woman leading men in prayer applies equally to obligatory prayers, Tarawih and all supererogatory prayers. This is our view and the view of all the scholars from the earlier and later generations – may Allah have mercy on them. Al-Bayhaqi narrated this from the seven jurists, the Tabi’i jurists of Madinah. It is also the view of Malik, Abu Hanifah, Sufyan, Ahmad and Dawud…. 
Moreover if a woman leads a man or men in prayer, the men’s prayer is invalid, but her prayer and the prayer of any women who pray behind her is valid in all prayers, except if she leads them in Jumu’ah prayer, in which case there are two views, the most sound of which is that her prayer does not count. The second view is that it does count and it takes the place of Thuhr. This is the view of Shaykh Abu Hamid, but it does not amount to anything. And Allah knows best.” 
In Al-Insaf (2/265) it says: 
“A woman’s leading a man in prayer is not valid”, this is our view in general – meaning the Madhhab of Imam Ahmad – it says in Al-Mustaw’ib: This is the correct view.”
The Maliki view concerning this matter is the strictest of all. They do not allow a woman to lead even other women in prayer, and they regard maleness as an essential condition for leading the prayer in all cases. In Al-Fawakih Ad-Dawani it says (1/204): 
“Note that there are conditions for leading the prayer to be valid and complete. The conditions of it being valid are thirteen, the first of which is being male; it is not valid for a woman or an effeminate man to lead the prayer. The prayer of the one who prays behind a woman is invalid but not the prayer of the woman who led the prayer.”
Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about a man who prayed ‘Asr behind his wife. He replied: 
“It is not permissible for a woman to lead a man in prayer and his prayer offered behind her is not valid, because of a great deal of evidence to that effect, and the man mentioned must repeat his prayer.”  (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn Baz, 12/130)
Did the Prophet give Umm Waraqah permission to lead her household in prayer? 
With regard to the evidence presented by those who refer to the reports which say that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) gave Umm Waraqah permission to lead her household in prayer (narrated by Abu Dawud, 591), they say that she used to lead the people of her house in prayer, among whom were men and boys. The scholars have given several answers to that: 

The Hadith is inauthentic.

Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said in At-Talkhis (p. 121): “Its Isnad (chain of narration) includes ‘Abd Ar-Rahman ibn Khallad who is unknown.” 
It says in Al-Muntaqa Sharh Al-Muwatta’: 
“This Hadith is one to which no attention should be paid.”

Even if the Hadith is authentic, what it means is that she used to lead the women of her household in prayer.
That was something that applied only to Umm Waraqah, and it is not prescribed for anyone else.
Some scholars quote it as evidence that a woman may lead a man in prayer, but only in cases of necessity, and what is meant by necessity is when there is no man who can recite Al-Fatihah properly. (Hashiyat Ibn Qasim, 2/313) (See Al-Mughni, 3/33)",Islam Q&A
39189,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39189,Is a woman who puts her hair on the side included among those mentioned in the hadeeth about “maa’ilaat mumeelaat”,Is what is meant by the women who are maa’ilaat in the hadeeth gathering the hair and putting it to one side?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Imam Muslim narrated in his Saheeh that the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There are two types 
    of the people of Hell whom I have not seen, men with whips like the tails of 
    cattle with which they strike the people, and women who are clothed yet 
    naked, maa’ilaat mumeelaat walking with an enticing gait (or turning 
    away from righteousness and leading others astray) with their heads like the 
    humps of camels leaning to one side. They will not enter Paradise nor smell 
    its fragrance.” 

    With regard to the phrase maa’ilaat mumeelaat, there 
    are four opinions among the scholars: 

    1 – That they turn away (maa’ilaat) from chastity and 
    righteousness, i.e., they commit sins and wrong deeds, like those who do 
    immoral actions or fall short in performing obligatory duties such as 
    prayers etc. 

    And mumeelaat means that they lead others astray and call 
    them to evil and corruption. So by their actions and words they lead others 
    to corruption and sin and they commit immoral actions because of their lack 
    of faith or weakness of faith. 

    2 – That maa’ilaat refers to their enticing walk and 
    mumeelaat refers to the movement of their shoulders. 

    3 – That they incline towards men and lead them astray with 
    what they show of their beauty and adornments etc. 

    4 – That they style their hair in the manner of prostitutes 
    and style other women’s hair in the same manner.

With regard to styling 
    the hair, this means parting the hair in such a manner that there is more 
    hair on one side than on the other. This was the sign of a prostitute during 
    the Jaahiliyyah. 

    Some of the scholars are of the view that the hairstyle of 
    the prostitute is what is meant by the words of the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) “maa’ilaat mumeelaat”, but Shaykh 
    Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: The correct view is that what is meant by al-maa’ilaat 
    is those who turn away from what is enjoined upon them of modesty and 
    religious commitment, and al-mumeelaat means those who turn others away from 
    that. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: maa’ilah in a general sense 
    refers to anyone who turns away from the Straight Path, in her clothing, 
    appearance, speech etc. And mumeelaat refers to those who turn others away, 
    by using things which cause temptation, until people turn towards them.  

    With regard to gathering the hair together and putting it on 
    one side, Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: The Sunnah is to part the hair in the 
    middle, from the forelock at the front of the head up to the top of the 
    head, because the hair has directions to the front and the back and to the 
    right and the left. So the kind of parting that is prescribed in Islam is in 
    the middle of the head. As for parting it on the side, this is not 
    Islamically acceptable, because it may entail imitation of non-Muslims and 
    it may also be included in the meaning of the hadeeth in which the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There are two types 
    of the people of Hell whom I have not seen, men with whips like the tails of 
    cattle with which they strike the people, and women who are clothed yet 
    naked, maa’ilaat mumeelaat walking with an enticing gait (or turning 
    away from righteousness and leading others astray) with their heads like the 
    humps of camels leaning to one side. They will not enter Paradise nor smell 
    its fragrance.” 

    Some of the scholars interpreted the phrase al-maa’ilaat 
    al-mumeelaat as referring to those women who style their hair in such a way 
    that there is more hair on one side or who style the hair of others in that 
    manner, but the correct view is that what is meant by al-maa’ilaat is those 
    who turn away from what is enjoined upon them of modesty and religious 
    commitment, and mumeelaat means those who turn others away from that. 

    Parting the hair on the side was forbidden by some scholars 
    on the grounds that it is imitation of kaafir women. 

    It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah 17/126: 
With regard to parting 
    the hair on the side, that is an imitation of kaafir women, and it is proven 
    from the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) that it is forbidden to imitate the kuffaar. End quote.

    If we assume that parting the hair on the side, for example, 
    was the sign of kaafir women or immoral women at one time, then that ceased 
    to be the case and this became widespread among Muslim women, and no one 
    would think that the one who does that is a kaafir or immoral woman, then in 
    that case it is no longer regarded as imitation of the kuffaar, so it is not 
    haraam. 

    Al-Haafiz said in al-Fath (1/307), when discussing 
    al-mayaasir al-arjawaan, which was a small pad or pillow that a horse-rider 
    places beneath him, which was a custom of the non-Arabs: If we say that this 
    is not allowed because it is an imitation of the non-Arabs, then this is for 
    a religious purpose. But if that was one of their symbols at that time, when 
    they were kuffaar, but it is no longer unique to them, then the idea of 
    imitation no longer applies and it is no longer makrooh, end quote. 

    He also said, refuting those who regarded wearing the 
    taylasaan (a shawl-like garment worn over the head and shoulders) as 
    imitation of the kuffaar, because it is the clothing of the Jews as 
    mentioned in the hadeeth of the Dajjaal: It was appropriate to quote the 
    story of the Jews as evidence at the time when the taylasaan was unique to 
    them, but that is no longer the case, so nowadays it is one of the things 
    that are permissible. Fath al-Baari, 10/274.",Islam Q&A
39191,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39191,If the sacrificial animal becomes damaged after selecting it,"I bought a sacrificial animal, and at the time of slaughtering it jumped from on top of the roof. We caught up with it and slaughtered it before it died. Is that counted as a sacrifice?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
If a person has selected a sacrificial animal, then some damage befalls it that is not caused by any wrongdoing or negligence, then he slaughters it at the time of slaughtering, then it is valid and is counted as a sacrifice. 
Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (13/373): 
If the sacrificial animal is sound and free of faults, then something happens to it that renders it unsuitable, it should be slaughtered and it still counts as a sacrifice. This was narrated from ‘Ata’, al-Hasan, al-Nakha’i, al-Zuhri, al-Thawri, Maalik, al-Shaafa’i and Ishaaq. End quote. 
The evidence for that is the report narrated by al-Bayhaqi from Ibn al-Zubayr (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which a one-eyed she-camel was brought to him as a sacrificial animal, and he said: If this happened to it after you bought it, then go ahead (and sacrifice it), but if it happened to it before you bought it, then offer another one instead of it.” Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmoo’ (8/328): its isnaad is saheeh. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said in his essay Ahkaam al-Udhiyah (Rulings on the Sacrifice) concerning the rulings on selection of the sacrificial animal: 
If the animal has a fault that renders it unsuitable for sacrifice, one of two scenarios must apply: 
1 – That was caused by the owner’s wrongdoing or negligence, in which case it must be replaced with another animal that is the same or more perfect, because if the damage was caused by him, he must replace it with another one to be slaughtered instead, and the damaged animal still belongs to him, according to the sound scholarly opinion; he may do whatever he wants with it, sell it or whatever. 
2 – The fault was caused without any wrongdoing or negligence on the owner’s part. In that case he should sacrifice it and it counts as a sacrifice, because it is a trust that is in his keeping but it got damaged through no action or negligence on his part, so there is no sin on him and he does not have to replace it. End quote. 
Secondly: 
How is a sacrificial animal selected? 
The selection of the sacrificial animal may be verbal, such as saying, “This is a sacrificial animal.” 
If they buy it with the intention of offering it as a sacrifice, Abu Haneefah and Maalik (may Allah have mercy on them) are of the view that the selection has been made thereby. Al-Shaafa’i and Ahmad are of the view that the selection is not made thereby. 
The scholars of the Standing Committee are of the view that the selection is made when one buys the animal with the intention of offering it as a sacrifice. 
It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 11/402: 
The sacrificial animal is selected when one buys it with the intention of offering it as a sacrifice or when one selects it. End quote. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Majmoo’ al-Fataawa (26/304): 
If a person buys a sacrificial animal and it gets damaged before slaughter, it may be slaughtered according to one of the two scholarly opinions. End quote. 
Based on the above, if you bought this sheep with the intention of offering a sacrifice, then it gets damaged without any wrongdoing or negligence on your part, then it is counted as a sacrifice, in sha Allah. 
And Allah knows best.",Islam Q&A
