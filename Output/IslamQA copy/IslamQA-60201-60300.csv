60212,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/60212,Is the fermentation of tea haraam?,"I came across an old magazine, and noticed the following, which I will quote as it appears in the magazine, about tea and its benefits: “There is a difference between green and black tea in the way it is preserved and ‘fermented’ after being collected. Black tea, which is also known as Ceylon tea or English tea, is made from green tea, after the fresh leaves are picked and dried in a simple fashion, then they are soaked until they ferment.

 My question is: Is this process of fermenting tea regarded as haraam?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The fermentation of tea that is mentioned in this article is 
    not the same as the fermentation that happens to grapes, dates etc in order 
    to make them intoxicants. Rather what is meant by fermentation here is 
    oxidization, i.e., exposing the tea to oxygen for three hours, according to 
    the experts.  

    With green tea, the leaves are treated with steam after 
    picking, then they are dried immediately, and not exposed to any 
    oxidization, rather they are preserved with the same properties as are found 
    in fresh tea. 

    But in the case of black tea, the leaves are separated after 
    collection and are sorted into fine layers on a net made of wire or 
    sackcloth in order to get rid of excess water, then the leaves are crumbled 
    and sifted, then subjected to an oxidization process, by exposing the fresh 
    leaves to oxygen for three hours, until the tea loses its green colour and 
    becomes dark coloured, after which it becomes black tea.  

    If this oxidization is done only partially, we get tea that 
    is partially fermented, between green and black. This is called tannin and 
    it combines the qualities of both black and green tea. 

    See: Mawsoo’ah al-A’shaab al-Tibbiyyah by the 
    pharmacist Dr Ahmad Muhammad ‘Awf; Qaamoos al-Ghidha’ wa’l-Tadaawi 
    bi’l-Nabaat by Ahmad Qudaamah, published by Daar al-Nafaa’is; 
    al-Ghidha’ la al-Dawa’ by Dr. Sabri al-Qabbaani, published by Dar 
    al-‘Ilm li’l-Malaayeen. All of these books are arranged in alphabetical 
    order. 

    This is what we have been able to find out about expert 
    opinions on this matter. Thus it is clear that the process of fermenting 
    tealeaves is not haraam, rather fermenting them means exposing them to 
    oxygen, and we do no know of any scholar who says that this is haraam.

Can You Read the Quran during menses?","Praise be to Allah.Can Women Enter the Mosque During Menses?
The majority of jurists of the four Schools of Fiqh are of the view that it is not permissible for a menstruating woman to enter and stay in the mosque . They quoted as evidence for that the report narrated by Al-Bukhari (974) and Muslim (890) from Umm `Atiyyah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: “He (the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)) commanded us on the two `Ids to bring out the virgins and those who usually stayed in seclusion, but he told the menstruating women to keep away from the prayer-place of the Muslims.” 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told menstruating women to stay away from the Eid prayer-place, because it comes under the same ruling as a mosque. This indicates that menstruating women are not allowed to enter the mosque. 
They also quoted other Hadiths as evidence, but they are inauthentic and are not valid to be quoted as evidence, such as the Hadith in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is reported to have said, “The mosque is not permitted for menstruating women or anyone who is Junub.” This Hadith was classed as inauthentic by Al-Albani in Da`if Abu Dawud, 232. 
The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked (6/272): 
What is the ruling on a woman who enters the mosque when she is menstruating to listen to the Khutbah only? 
They relied: 
“It is not permissible for a woman to enter the mosque when she is menstruating or bleeding following childbirth… as for passing through, there is nothing wrong with that if it is necessary and there is no risk of her contaminating the mosque, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“nor when you are in a state of Janabah (i.e. in a state of sexual impurity and have not yet taken a bath), except when travelling on the road (without enough water, or just passing through a mosque), till you wash your whole body.” [An-Nisa’ 4:43]
A menstruating woman is similar to one who is in a state of major impurity. And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told `Aishah to fetch him something from the mosque when she was menstruating.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 6/272)
Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Is it permissible for a menstruating woman to attend Halaqahs in the mosque? 
He replied: 
“It is not permissible for a menstruating woman to stay in the mosque. As for passing through the mosque, there is nothing wrong with that, subject to the condition that there is no risk of the mosque being contaminated with the blood that is coming out of her. If it is not permissible for her to stay in the mosque, it is not permissible for her to go there to listen to Halaqahs and recitation of Quran, unless there is a place outside the mosque where the sound can reach via loudspeakers, in which case there is nothing wrong with her sitting there to listen to the Dhikr. There is nothing wrong with a woman listening to Dhikr and recitation of Quran, as it is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to lay his head in `Aishah’s lap and recite Quran when she was menstruating. But it is not permissible for a menstruating woman to go to the mosque and stay there to listen to Dhikr or Quran recitation. Hence when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) heard, during the Farewell Pilgrimage, that Safiyyah was menstruating, he said: “Has she detained us?” because he thought that she had not done Tawaf Al-ifadah , but they said that she had already done it. This indicates that it is not permissible to stay in the mosque even for acts of worship. And it is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told women to go out to the `Id prayer-place to pray and remember Allah (Dhikr), but he told the menstruating women to keep away from the prayer-place itself.” (Fatawa At-Taharah, p. 273) (See the views of the jurists in Al-Mabsut, 3/153; Hashiyat Ad-Dusuqi, 1/173; Al-Majmu`, 2/388; Al-Mughni, 1/195)
Can You Read the Quran during menses?
A menstruating woman may read the Quran without touching the Mus-haf . She may read a Mus-haf that is printed with the Tafsir (commentary). Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: As for the books of Tafsir, it is permissible (for a menstruating woman) to touch them, because they are regarded as Tafsir, and the verses that are in them are less than the Tafsir that is in them. 
They quoted as evidence for this the fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wrote letters to the disbelievers containing verses from the Quran, which indicates that the ruling depends on what constitutes the majority of the letter, which was not the word of Allah. 
But if the Quran and Tafir are of equal amounts, this comes under the rule that when the reasons for regarding something as permissible are equal to the reasons for making it forbidden, and there is no way of distinguishing which outweighs the other, then the reasons for forbidding it take precedence, so it comes under the same rulings as Quran. 
If the Tafsir is more, even if it is only slightly more, then it comes under the same rulings as Tafsir.” (Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti`, 1/267)
What is mentioned in the question about the menstruating woman being afraid of missing some topics or lessons if she cannot enter the mosque can be dealt with by recording those lessons, or by her listening from outside the mosque, if that is possible. Some mosques have additional rooms that do not come under the same rulings as mosques, such as a library or rooms for memorising the Quran, so women who are not allowed to sit in the mosque should be able to sit there. 
And Allah knows best.",Islam Q&A
60219,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/60219,Does a good intention intercede for one?,Does a good intention intercede for one? Or are there other considerations with regard that?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.No act of worship will be accepted from a Muslim unless it meets two basic conditions: 
1 – Sincerity of intention towards Allah, may He be exalted. This means that the aims of the person in his words and deeds, both outward and inward, should be to seek the Countenance of Allah alone. 
2 – It should be in accordance with the ways in which Allah has ordained that He be worshipped only. That is achieved by following the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and what he taught, and shunning anything that goes against that, and not introducing any new acts or forms of worship that have not been narrated in proven reports from him (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
The evidence for these two conditions is the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
"" So whoever hopes for the Meeting with his Lord, let him work righteousness and associate none as a partner in the worship of his Lord"" [al-Kahf 18:110]
Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
"" So whoever hopes for the Meeting with his Lord"" – means His reward 
"" let him work righteousness "" – means, that is in accordance with the laws of Allah. 
"" and associate none as a partner in the worship of his Lord"" – means the deed by which is sought the Countenance of Allah alone, with no partner or associate. These are the two features of the deed that is acceptable: it must be sincerely for the sake of Allah alone, and it must be in accordance with the sharee'ah of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).""(Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 4/108)
Hence Allah says in the greatest soorah in the Quran (interpretation): 
"" You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything)""
[al-Faatihah 1:5], to indicate that Tawheed and sincerity are essential in order for a deed to be valid.  
The second condition comes immediately after that: 
""Guide us to the Straight Way"" [al-Faatihah 1:6]
No act of worship is valid unless it is in accordance with the right way, the straight path, which Allah has enjoined, by following His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). In al-Saheeh it is narrated from 'Aa'ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""Whoever does any action that is not in accordance with this matter of ours will have it rejected."" Narrated by Muslim, 1718. i.e., his deed will be thrown back at him and not accepted from him. If anyone goes against these two conditions (sincerity towards Allah alone and following His laws) in any action, then he will not benefit from it. The one who seeks goodness and wants to please his Lord, let him worship Him and draw near to Him by the means that He has ordained. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
""Say (O Muhammad to mankind): If you (really) love Allah, then follow me (i.e. accept Islamic Monotheism, follow the Quran and the Sunnah), Allah will love you and forgive you your sins. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful"" [Aal 'Imraan 3:31]
So it is not sufficient to have a good intention, and it will not intercede for him if he goes against sharee'ah and worships Allah by means of any kind of bid'ah (innovation). Many of those who invent innovations – because of their ignorance – invent these innovations in order to draw closer to Allah. 
Hence when Ibn Mas'ood (may Allah be pleased with him) denounced those who gathered to remember Allah (dhikr), they gave the excuse that their intention was good and that they did not mean anything but good, and he said to them: ""How many of those who intend good do not attain it!"" Narrated by al-Daarimi, 204. So it is not sufficient to have a good intention in order to do good and attain the reward and draw closer to Allah. Rather it is essential to also act in accordance with sharee'ah and avoid bid'ah. 
A good intention may intercede for a person in two cases: 
1 – Turning habits into acts of worship 
A good intention may turn a habit into an act of worship for which a person will be rewarded. So by eating and drinking he may intend to strengthen himself to obey Allah, and by getting married he may intend to keep himself and his wife chaste, and so on. 
2 – Earning reward without doing any deed, if the Muslim is definite in his intention. 
A Muslim may form a definite intention to do acts that are prescribed in sharee'ah, then something prevents him from doing that – but he will still be rewarded for it. There are a number of ahaadeeth concerning that, such as the following: 
1 – It was narrated that Jaabir (may Allah be pleased with him) said: We were with the Prophet on a campaign and he said: ""You did not travel any distance or cross any valley but in Madeenah there are men who were with you, but they were kept behind by sickness."" According to another version: ""… but they shared the reward with you."" Narrated by Muslim, 1911. 
2 – It was narrated from Abu'l-Darda' (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet said: ""Whoever goes to his bed intending to get up and pray at night, then his eyes overwhelm him and (he sleeps) until morning, the (reward for) that which he intended will be written for him, and his sleep is a charity for him given by his Lord, may He be glorified and exalted."" Narrated by al-Nasaa’i, 1787; Ibn Maajah, 1344; classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albani in Saheeh al-Targheeb, 601. 
3 – It was narrated from Sahl ibn Haneef that the Prophet said: ""Whoever sincerely asks Allah for martyrdom will attain the status of the martyrs even if he dies in his bed."" Narrated by Muslim, 1909. 
And there are many other such reports, all of which indicate that whoever forms a sincere, definite intention to do good or obey Allah, then is prevented from doing that deed, Allah will decree the reward for him. 
So this is the case where a sincere intention will intercede for a person until he is rewarded for it.

60221,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/60221,Is it permissible for a woman to work selling products over the phone?,"There are foreign companies in Morocco which also own companies in the west. These companies that are in Morocco offer customer service for the companies that are in the west over the phone, whereby western customers contact the companies in Morocco to ask questions or the company contacts customers who are obviously in the west – Europe – to sell their products over the phone, and the employee attempts to convince the person to buy. The companies market various products and services such as mobile phones, internet, insurance, computers and so on.

 These companies have started to increase rapidly, and young men – and even young women – are clamouring to join them as they pay a good salary. The government is also helping with that. Please note that fitnah is widespread in these companies, such as uncovering of women.

 What is the ruling on working for them? Is it halaal or haraam?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    It is not permissible for a man or a woman to work in places 
    where women mix with men. The evils of mixing are many. It is one of the 
    most effective ways used by the shaytaan to make the Muslim fall into sin 
    and immorality. Hence Islam blocks the ways that may cause a Muslim to fall 
    into anything haraam. 

    We have discussed the prohibition on mixing in the answer to 
    question no. 1200, where we mention 
    incidents of female workers who have been exposed to annoyance and 
    harassment. This confirms that the Islamic prohibition on mixing is what 
    will protect a woman’s modesty and chastity, and it is what protects a man 
    from allowing his gaze to wander, and protects him from bad consequences. 

    There is no reason why a woman should not work if she is with 
    other women like her, or she is alone and answers calls from customers or 
    calls them to offer the company’s products, so long as she observes proper 
    etiquette when speaking and does not speak in an alluring tone to men, 
    because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “O wives of the Prophet! You are not like any other women. 
    If you keep your duty (to Allaah), then be not soft in speech, lest he in 
    whose heart is a disease (of hypocrisy, or evil desire for adultery) should

60235,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/60235,He is uncertain of his wife’s virginity because there was no bleeding,"I got married about five months ago and intercourse with my wife was difficult at first, but she did not bleed until now. I do not know if she was a virgin or if something happened that I do not know about – Allaah forbid – especially since she was engaged before I got to know her, to a young man who is known for his immoral ways such as drinking, taking drugs and committing zina.

 Please advise us, may Allaah reward you. I do not want to wrong or be wronged, but the Shaytaan is not leaving me alone.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    You should note that the shaytaan is extremely keen to cause 
    division between a man and his wife. It is narrated in a saheeh report that 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Iblees 
    places his throne on the water, then he sends out his troops, and those who 
    are the closest in status to him are those who cause the most tribulation 
    (fitnah). One of them comes and says, ‘I did such and such,’ and he says, 
    ‘You have not done anything.’ Then one of them comes and says, ‘I did not 
    leave him alone until I caused division between him and his wife.’ Then he 
    brings him close to him and says, ‘How good you are.’” Narrated by Muslim, 
    5023. 

    In order for the shaytaan to reach this objective of his, 
    there are many methods he uses to reach a man, one of which is creating 
    doubt about his wife’s chastity. 

    Secondly: 

    You should also note that the fact that a woman does not 
    bleed the first time she has intercourse does not necessarily mean that the 
    woman has been unchaste, because the hymen may be elastic and there is no 
    bleeding when intercourse takes place, as has been stated by doctors.  

    It may also be broken for many reasons other than 
    intercourse, such as sports, jumping and so on. 

    Moreover, the blood that is usually expected may be only one 
    or two drops, and this blood may come out mixed with other secretions, so 
    the man does not see it because it is not visible. 

    For all of these reasons and others, it is not permissible 
    for a man to doubt his wife’s chastity because she does not bleed when he 
    first has intercourse with her. The fact that there is no bleeding does not 
    mean that she is not chaste, just as the presence of bleeding does not mean 
    that she is chaste, because some women have surgery to repair the hymen. 

    If your wife is a chaste woman and is religiously committed 
    and of good character, then you should not let the shaytaan have any way of 
    getting to you and spoiling your life. Seek refuge with Allaah from the 
    accursed shaytaan, and do not doubt your wife without any clear proof. 

    May Allaah bless you both, and join you together in goodness, 
    and divert the plot of the shaytaan away from you.

60244,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/60244,Is it permissible for him to live with his paternal uncle who has adolescent daughters?,"I am a young man, living with my paternal uncle who has 7 daughters. We live in one house, where we are separated by the walls. Is it permissible for me to live with them, as they have now reached the age of adolescence?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    What we advise you to do is not to live with your uncle and 
    his family, because you are not a mahram for your uncle’s wife or for his 
    daughters, and this will cause you and them a great deal of restrictions if 
    you live with them. 

    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    forbade entering upon women, and when the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) was asked about the husband’s relatives, he spoke 
    more sternly about them than about anyone else. So listen to the hadeeth and 
    read what the scholars have said about it. 

    It was narrated from ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Aamir that the Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Beware of 
    entering upon women.” A man from among the Ansaar said: O Messenger of 
    Allaah, what about the in-law? He said: “The in-law is death.”

    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4934; Muslim, 2172. 

    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    The scholars of Arabic language are agreed that the word 
    ahma’ (in-laws) refers to the relatives of a woman’s husband, such as 
    his father, brother, nephew, cousin and so on. 

    With regard to the words of the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him), “the in-law is death”, what this means is 
    that the fear with regard to him is greater than the fear with regard to 
    others, and evil is expected from him and the fitnah is greater because he 
    is able to reach the woman and be alone with her without being denounced for 
    that, unlike one who is a stranger. 

    What is meant by the in-law here is the relatives of the 
    husband, apart from his father (and grandfather) or his sons. Fathers and 
    sons are mahrams for his wife and it is permissible for them to be alone 
    with her, and they are not described as being death. Rather what is meant 
    here is the brother, nephew, uncle, cousin and so on, who are not mahrams. 
    The custom among people is to take this matter lightly, so a man may be 
    alone with his brother’s wife. This is what is meant by death, and he should 
    be prevented more than a stranger for the reasons we have mentioned. What I 
    have mentioned is the correct meaning of the hadeeth. 

    Ibn al-A’raabi said: This is a phrase that is used by the 
    Arabs, as it is said: The lion is death, i.e., meeting a lion is like death. 
    Al-Qaadi said: what is meant is being alone with the in-laws (the husband’s 
    relatives) which may lead to fitnah and disaster for one's religious 
    commitment, so it is likened to the disaster of death in order to 
    demonstrate the seriousness of the matter. End quote. 

    Sharh Muslim, 14/154 

    You can see that this hadeeth applies to your situation, if 
    you enter upon your uncle’s wife or daughters who are non-mahrams for you, 
    so what about the ruling if you live with them? 

    Secondly: 

    If you have no alternative but to live with them, or you are 
    going to stay there temporarily until you find another house, then you must 
    pay attention to the following matters: 

    1 – Avoid being alone with your uncle’s wife or one of his 
    daughters. 

    It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with 
    him) that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “No man should be alone with a woman and she should not travel unless she is 
    accompanied by a mahram.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2844; Muslim, 1341. 

    2 – Both you and the women should lower the gaze and avoid 
    looking at one another. 

    Allaah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking 
    at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual 
    acts). That is purer for them. Verily, Allaah is All‑Aware of what they do.

    31. And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from 
    looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal 
    sexual acts) and not to show off their adornment except only that which is 
    apparent (like both eyes for necessity to see the way, or outer palms of 
    hands or one eye or dress like veil, gloves, headcover, apron), and to draw 
    their veils all over Juyûbihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and 
    bosoms) and not to reveal their adornment except to their husbands, or their 
    fathers, or their husband’s fathers, or their sons, or their husband’s 
    sons…”

    [al-Noor 24:30-31] 

    3 – When you speak to them or they speak to you, there should 
    be no softening of the voice or speaking in an alluring tone. 

    Allaah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “O wives of the Prophet! You are not like any other women. 
    If you keep your duty (to Allaah), then be not soft in speech, lest he in 
    whose heart is a disease (of hypocrisy, or evil desire for adultery) should 
    be moved with desire, but speak in an honourable manner”

    [al-Ahzaab 33:32]

    4 – Your uncle’s wife and daughters should observe proper 
    hijab in front of you, covering the entire body. 

    It is better for you not to live with them, and to look for a 
    house of your own, so as to relieve them and you of any shar’i restrictions, 
    and so that you will not be a cause of hardship and restrictions for them. 
    If their house is big and you can have a separate room with all amenities, 
    then it is permissible for you to live there, but as for living in a room in 
    their house, and sharing the facilities of the house, we do not think that 
    that is permissible, and we think that the conditions that we have mentioned 
    for it to be permissible will be difficult for many people to meet.

1 –Buraydah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: During the Jahiliyyah, if a boy was born to one of us, we would slaughter a sheep and smear his head with its blood. When Allah brought Islam, we would slaughter a sheep and shave (the child’s) head and smear it with saffron. (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 2843; classed as sahih by Shaykh al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud)
Saffron is a type of perfume. 
2 –Salman ibn ‘Amir (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “For a boy there should be ‘aqiqah so shed blood for him and remove the dirt from him.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5154)
'Aqiqah for a male newborn and a female newborn
It is prescribed to slaughter two sheep for a newborn boy and one sheep for a girl, as is indicated by the sahih evidence, such as the following: 
1 –Umm Karaz narrated that she asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about ‘aqiqah, and he said: “For a boy, two sheep, and for a female one sheep, and it does not matter if it is male or female.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1516, who said this is a sahih hasan hadith; and by al-Nasai, 4217; classed as sahih by Shaykh al-Albani in Irwa al-Ghalil, 4/391)
2 – ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded them (to slaughter) two sheep of similar type for a boy and one sheep for a girl. (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1513, who said it is hasan sahih; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi)
'Aqiqah: Why one sheep for a girl and two for a boy?
These ahadith clearly show that there is a difference between male and female with regard to ‘aqiqah. 
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) explained this difference between male and female as follows: 
“This is a principle of Shari’ah, for Allah differentiates between male and female, and gives the female half the share of the male in terms of inheritance, diyah, testimony, freeing slaves and ‘aqiqah, as was narrated by al-Tirmidhi in a hadith which he classed as sahih from Umamah from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who said: “Any Muslim who frees a Muslim, he will be his ransom from the Fire, and each of (the slave’s) limbs will suffice for his limbs. Any Muslim man who sets free two Muslim women, they will be his ransom from the Fire, and each of their limbs will suffice for his limbs.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1547)
This differentiation with regard to ‘aqiqah would apply even if there was no clear sunnah concerning the matter, so how about when the Sunnah is clearly established and shows that there is this differentiation?” (Tuhfat al-Mawdud, p. 53, 54)
Ibn al-Qayyim also said: 
Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has favoured the male over the female, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And the male is not like the female” [Aal ‘Imran 3:36]
This differentiation is reflected in Islamic rulings, whereby the male is regarded as equivalent to two females in terms of testimony, inheritance and blood money (diyah), and ‘aqiqah also comes under these rulings.” (Zad al-Ma’ad, 2/331)
What are the benefits of 'aqiqah?
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Among the benefits of ‘aqiqah is that it is a sacrifice that is offered on behalf of the newborn when he first emerges into this world. 
Another benefit is that it “releases” the newborn, for he is held in pledge for his ‘aqiqah so that he may intercede for his parents. 
Another benefit is that it is a ransom that is paid for the newborn just as Allah, may He be exalted, ransomed Isma’il with the ram.” (Tuhfat al-Mawdud, p. 69)
What is the best to offer 'aqiqah?
The best time for offering the ‘aqiqah is seven days after birth, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Every child is held in pledge for his ‘aqiqah, which should be slaughtered on his behalf on the seventh day, and he should be shaved and given his name.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 2838; classed as sahih by Shaykh al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud) 
If it is delayed until after the seventh day, there is no sin, and it should be offered when the Muslim is able to do that. 
And Allah knows best.",Islam Q&A
60259,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/60259,His father does not let him pray Fajr in the mosque – should he obey him?,"I am 16 years old and the mosque is close to our house, but my father does not allow me to pray Fajr there, although he lets me offer all the other prayers there. He says that he is afraid that something may happen to me, because between our house and the mosque there is an intersection. I have spoken to him a great deal and tried to convince him by quoting verses and ahaadeeth, but to no avail. Should I go and pray without his knowledge?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    To begin with, we would like to congratulate you for these 
    good intentions and keenness to offer the obligatory prayers in 
    congregation. We ask Allaah to make you steadfast in adhering to Islam and 
    righteousness, and we pray that your father’s actions will not put you off 
    from doing what is right and following true guidance. Before answering your 
    question, we should mention a very important matter, which is:  

    Honouring and obeying one's parents has been enjoined by 
    Allaah in many places in His holy Book, such as the verses in which He says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Worship Allaah and join none with Him (in worship); and 
    do good to parents …”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:36] 

    “And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. 
    And that you be dutiful to your parents. If one of them or both of them 
    attain old age in your life, say not to them a word of disrespect, nor shout 
    at them but address them in terms of honour.
24. And lower unto them 
    the wing of submission and humility through mercy, and say: ‘My Lord! Bestow 
    on them Your Mercy as they did bring me up when I was young’”

    [al-Isra’ 17:23, 24]

    Obedience to parents is obligatory, unless they tell you to 
    disobey Allaah, in which case you are not obliged to obey them, because the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no 
    obedience if it involves disobedience towards Allaah, rather obedience is 
    only in matters that are right and proper.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6830; 
    Muslim, 1840. 

    With regard to prayer in congregation, this is obligatory, 
    and it is not permissible for a father to forbid his son who has reached the 
    age of maturity to do it. Rather parents should enjoin their sons to pray in 
    congregation and encourage and urge them to do so. If the father notices 
    that his son is falling short in that regard, then he must make him aware of 
    his responsibilities and remind him that he will be questioned about it 
    before Allaah on the Day of Reckoning. So he should enjoin what is right and 
    forbid what is wrong, and remind those who are under his care of their 
    duties towards their Lord and the seriousness of neglecting those duties.  

    If the father falls short in his duties towards his children 
    by not enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, or encouraging 
    them to do good and warning them against evil, this does not absolve them 
    (the sons) of sin if they fall short in their duties or commit haraam 
    actions. 

    If the father forbids his sons to perform a duty that has 
    been enjoined upon them by Allaah, in that case they do not have to obey him 
    by disobeying Allaah or by forsaking that which Allaah has commanded. If the 
    father tells his son not to offer all or some of the prayers in 
    congregation, then he has told him to commit a sin, and this case he is not 
    to be obeyed, but at the same time he should be treated with kindness and 
    respect. 

    With regard to your question about going secretly to pray 
    Fajr, this is good on your part, but it is treating your father badly 
    without realizing it. You father is committing a sin so long as he forbids 
    you to pray in congregation, and even if you go out secretly, the burden of 
    sin is not lifted from him, because he is still telling you to do something 
    wrong and forbidding you to do something good, even if you go out to pray 
    without his knowledge. So you have to try to convince him of the Islamic 
    ruling, even if you get someone else to do it, if he will not listen to you 
    or he thinks you are too young. If he does not respond, then there is no sin 
    on you if you go out without his permission or knowledge, but you have to be 
    very careful when going to the mosque.

    Secondly: 

    We say to your father – may Allaah guide him – that Allaah 
    has given you a great responsibility, which is to teach and advise your 
    family, including your wife and children. The Messenger  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said in a hadeeth whose authenticity is 
    agreed upon: “Each of you is a shepherd and responsible for his flock. The 
    man is the shepherd of his family and is responsible for his flock.” 

    Allaah has commanded you to protect yourself and your family 
    from His Fire, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “O you who believe! Ward off yourselves and your families 
    against a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones, over which are 
    (appointed) angels stern (and) severe, who disobey not, (from executing) the 
    Commands they receive from Allaah, but do that which they are commanded”

    [al-Tahreem 66:6]

    And He says, enjoining the prayer (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “And enjoin As‑Salaah (the prayer) on your family, and be 
    patient in offering them [i.e. the Salaah (prayers)]. We ask not of you a 
    provision (i.e. to give Us something: money): We provide for you. And the 
    good end (i.e. Paradise) is for the Muttaqoon (the pious)”

    [Ta-Ha 20:132]

    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
Whoever neglects to 
    teach his son that which will benefit him, and ignores him, has done 
    something very bad indeed. Most children go astray because of their parents 
    who neglect them and fail to teach them the duties and Sunnahs of their 
    religion. They neglect them when they are young so they do not benefit 
    themselves or benefit their parents when they grow up. End quote. 

    Tuhfat al-Mawdood, p. 229 

    We ask you an important question: Where are you when it is 
    time for Fajr prayer? Is it not obligatory for you to offer the prayer in 
    congregation? Is it not obligatory for you to be a good example for your 
    family and children by praying in congregation in the house of Allaah? If 
    you do that, you will have fulfilled the duty that Allaah has enjoined upon 
    you, and you will have helped your son to pray in the mosque, and you will 
    put your mind at rest if you are worried about him going alone.

    Remember that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) has told us that whoever prays Fajr in the mosque will be under 
    the protection of Allaah, so how can you fear for one who is under the 
    protection of Allaah, may He be exalted? 

    It was narrated that Jundub ibn ‘Abd-Allaah (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever prays Fajr is under the protection of 
    Allaah, so do not fall short with regard to the rights of Allaah, for anyone 
    who does that, Allaah will seize him and will throw him on his face into the 
    Fire of Hell.”Narrated by Muslim, 657. 

    We ask Allaah to help you to fulfil the trust and to make you 
    a good example for your family, and to make you help your son to offer the 
    prayers in the house of Allaah.

60269,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/60269,"She advised him and he came to thank her, and they committed zina","I am a young woman from a very well-known family. All my life I have been religiously committed and of good character, as all will attest, but I do not know what is the reason that caused me to get to know a young man. I wanted to help him because he had suffered the calamity of his father’s death, and he is responsible for his siblings and his mother, but he went down the path of keeping company with bad people. I advised him and I felt it was my duty to stand beside him and advise him sincerely. Eventually he returned to his studies and gave up those bad friends, and he changed completely. His mother asked him the reason, and he told her. She spoke to me and thanked me for being patient with her son. One day he came for a visit to see me, and I did not know why I did not hesitate. I went to see him, and I felt as if he was my brother. We spent some time together and what happened happened, unfortunately. Now he wants to come and propose marriage to me, but it is impossible. He is three years younger than me, and he is not of the same nationality as me. Now I am pregnant and I want Allaah to conceal my sin and I want to repent. I know that I have done wrong, and you will criticize me severely, but I want to repent and I want a solution.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
Perhaps your letter will be a lesson to those who claim that a relationship between a man and a non-mahram woman can be “innocent”, and to those who claim that such relationships are Islamically acceptable if they are for the purpose of giving advice, and to those who want to “water down” the religion to allow relationships between men and women in the name of modernity, and claim that there is no reason why this should not be done, and that woman are able to control themselves… and other such foolish justifications. 
It is a lesson for all those who are heedless of the laws of Allaah and pay no attention to the warning of our Lord, may He blessed and exalted, against following in the footsteps of the shaytaan, and they continue to take these matters lightly until they find themselves in deep trouble. You were heedless with regard to this young man and you went ahead and spoke with him and advised him, then you agreed to receive him in your house, then you agreed to be alone with him, then the Shaytaan made attractive to you the idea that he was like your brother, then what? Then you committed zina in the same meeting and in your house, with one whom the shaytaan made you think was like your brother! Which was the first step of the shaytaan? It was speaking to this non-mahram man, then the other steps of the shaytaan came one after another until you committed this most abhorrent of sins. Hence we can see the wisdom in the words of Allaah, may He be exalted (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And come not near to unlawful sex. Verily, it is a Faahishah (i.e. anything that transgresses its limits: a great sin), and an evil way (that leads one to hell unless Allaah Forgives him)”
[al-Isra’ 17:32]
Allaah did not only forbid zina itself, rather He forbade coming near to it. The aim here is to forbid the things that lead to it. We ask Allaah to conceal your sin and to forgive you, and to help you to repent sincerely. 
Secondly: 
There is no doubt that zina is a grave sin, and it is one of the major sins. Hence the punishment for it is one that points to the seriousness of this sin and the abhorrence with which it is regarded in sharee’ah and by wisdom and common sense. 
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
Allaah ordained punishment for zina that differs from the punishment for other crimes in three ways: 
1 – Execution in the most unpleasant form; when the punishment is reduced, it still combines the physical punishment of flogging with the emotional punishment of banishment. 
2 – He forbade people when carrying out the punishment on the adulterers, to feel pity for them that would prevent them from carrying out the punishment. By His mercy towards them He prescribed this punishment, and He is more merciful to them than you, but His mercy did not prevent Him from ordaining this punishment, so your pity should not prevent you from carrying out His command… 
3 – He enjoined that their punishment be carried out in the presence of some of the believers; it should not be done in isolation where no one can see them. That is more effective in serving the purpose of the punishment, and serves as a deterrent. End quote. 
Al-Jawaab al-Kaafi, p. 144, 115 
Thirdly: 
Although this sin is so serious and abhorrent, Allaah has opened the door of repentance to those who commit it, and He has promised that if they are sincere in their repentance, He will turn their bad deeds into good deeds.  
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: 
What should the person who has committed zina do in order to rid himself of the effects of that action of his? 
He replied: 
Zina is one of the most serious of haraam actions and the worst of major sins. Allaah warns the mushrikeen, murderers and adulterers of multiple punishments on the Day of Resurrection, and of eternal humiliation and torment, because of the seriousness and abhorrence of their crimes, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And those who invoke not any other ilaah (god) along with Allaah, nor kill such person as Allaah has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse — and whoever does this shall receive the punishment.
69. The torment will be doubled to him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace;
70. Except those who repent and believe (in Islamic Monotheism), and do righteous deeds”
[al-Furqaan 25:68-70]
The one who has fallen into such sin has to repent to Allaah sincerely, and follow that with sincere belief and righteous deeds. Repentance is sincere if the penitent gives up the sin, regrets what has happened in the past and resolves never to go back to it, out of fear of Allaah and awe of Him, hoping for His reward and fearing His punishment. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And verily, I am indeed forgiving to him who repents, believes (in My Oneness, and associates none in worship with Me) and does righteous good deeds, and then remains constant in doing them (till his death)”
[Ta-Ha 20:82]
Every Muslim man and Muslim woman must beware of this great evil and the things that lead to it, and hasten to repent from whatever is already past. Allaah will accept the repentance of those who are sincere and forgive them. 
Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 9/442 
Fourthly: 
It is not permissible for two people who have committed zina to get married except after having repented sincerely, because Allaah has forbidden that to the believers: 
“The adulterer — fornicator marries not but an adulteress — fornicatress or a Mushrikah; and the adulteress –fornicatress, none marries her except an adulterer — fornicater or a Mushrik [and that means that the man who agrees to marry (have a sexual relation with) a Mushrikah (female polytheist, pagan or idolatress) or a prostitute, then surely, he is either an adulterer — fornicator, or a Mushrik (polytheist, pagan or idolater). And the woman who agrees to marry (have a sexual relation with) a Mushrik (polytheist, pagan or idolater) or an adulterer — fornicator, then she is either a prostitute or a Mushrikah (female polytheist, pagan, or idolatress)]. Such a thing is forbidden to the believers (of Islamic Monotheism)”
[al-Noor 24:3]
We have already explained the ruling on this issue in the answer to questions no. 14381, 22448, 11195. 
Fifthly: 
If the soul has been breathed into the foetus, then aborting it would be another crime in addition to zina. We have explained the ruling on this issue in the answer to questions no. 13317, 11195 and 40269. 
Sixthly: 
The solution to your problem is to inform wise people among your family about your situation. The one who transgresses the laws of Allaah must inevitably face the consequences of his sin, in many cases. The family has to stand with their daughter sooner rather than later. Even if she aborts the foetus before the soul has been breathed into it, she is no longer regarded as a virgin, and this will also cause some problems at the time of marriage. Whatever the case, they have to solve their daughter’s problem, for she has repented and regretted her sin, and “the one who repents from sin is like one who has not sinned at all” – narrated by Ibn Maajah, 4250; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Targheeb, 3145. Even if she does not commit any sin after she repents, her sin has serious repercussions which must be dealt with before news of it becomes widespread and affects the family as a whole. The solution is not to marry her to that zaani before he repents, because marriage to a zaani is haraam, as stated above. But if they both repent, there is nothing wrong with them getting married in sha Allaah. 
It is not permissible for her to marry anyone else until her womb is emptied, which is when she gives birth. The evidence for that is the report narrated by Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allaah be pleased with him) from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who said: “Do not have intercourse with a pregnant woman until she gives birth, or with one who is not pregnant until she has menstruated once.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2157. al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said in al-Talkhees al-Habeer (1/171,172): Its isnaad is hasan. 
In order to understand the greatness of Allaah’s bounty in accepting His slaves’ repentance and to know that He accepts the repentance of the penitent no matter how great and how many their sins, please see the answers to the questions no. 624, 13990, 47834, 23485 and 20983

Did Al-Isra’ and Al-Mi`raj take place in Rajab?


Can Muslims celebrate the night of Al-Isra’ and Al-Mi`raj?


Why did the Prophet warn Muslims against Bid`ah?","Praise be to Allah.Shayk Ibn Baz (May Allah have mercy on him) said:
Al-Isra’ and Al-Mi`raj are two great signs of Allah
“There is no doubt that the Isra’ and Mi`raj (the Prophet’s Night Journey and Ascent into heaven) are two great signs of Allah which point to the truthfulness of the His Messenger Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and the greatness of his status before Allah. They are also signs of the great power of Allah, and of His exalted position above His creation. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Glorified (and Exalted) be He (Allah) [above all that (evil) they associate with Him]
Who took His slave (Muhammad) for a journey by night from Al-Masjid Al-Haram (at Makkah) to Al-Masjid Al-Aqsa (in Jerusalem), the neighbourhood whereof We have blessed, in order that We might show him (Muhammad) of Our Ayaat (proofs, evidences, lessons, signs, etc.). Verily, He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.” [Al-Isra’ 17:1] 
There are Mutawatir reports from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that he was taken up into the heavens, and their gates were opened for him, until he passed beyond the seventh heaven, where his Lord spoke to him as He willed, and enjoined the five daily prayers upon him. At first Allah, may He be Exalted, enjoined fifty prayers, but our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) kept going back and asking Him to reduce it, until He made them five, so they are five obligatory prayers but fifty in reward, because each good deed is rewarded tenfold. To Allah belongs all praise and thanks for all His blessings. 
Did Al-Isra’ and Al-Mi`raj take place in Rajab?
With regard to this night on which the Isra’ and Mi`raj took place, there is nothing in the authentic Hadiths to indicate that it is in Rajab or in any other month. Everything that has been narrated concerning a specific date for these events cannot be proven to have come from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) according to the scholars of Hadith. Allah has wise reasons for causing the people to forget it. 
Can Muslims celebrate the night of Al-Isra’ and Al-Mi`raj?
Even if the date were proven, it would not be permissible for the Muslims to single this night out for particular acts of worship , and it is not permissible for them to celebrate it, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) did not celebrate it and they did not single it out in any way.
If celebrating this night was something that is prescribed in Islam, the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would have told his Ummah about that, either in word or in deed. If any such thing had happened, it would have been well known, and his Companions would have transmitted the information to us. 
They narrated from their Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) everything that his Ummah needs to know, and they did not neglect any aspect of the religion, rather they were the first ones to do anything good. If celebrating this night had been prescribed in Islam, they would have been the first people to do so. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was the most sincere of people, and he conveyed the message to the people in full, and he fulfilled the trust. If venerating and celebrating this night were part of the religion of Allah, then the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would have done that and would not have concealed it. 
Since no such thing happened, it is known that celebrating it and venerating it is not part of Islam at all. Allah has perfected this Ummah’s religion for it and has completed His favour upon them, and He condemns those who introduce things into the religion which Allah has not ordained. Allah says in His holy Book, in Surah Al-Ma’idah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion.” [Al-Ma’idah 5:3] 
And Allah says in Surah Ash-Shura (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Or have they partners with Allah (false gods) who have instituted for them a religion which Allah has not ordained?” [Ash-Shura 42:21] 
Why did the Prophet warn Muslims against Bid`ah?
In authentic Hadiths, it is proven that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) warned against Bid`ah (innovation) and stated clearly that it is misguidance, so as to show the Ummah how serious the matter is and put them off it. 
For example, it is narrated by Al-Bukhari and Musilm from `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever introduces anything into this matter of ours that is not part of it will have it rejected.” In a report narrated by Muslim it says: “Whoever does any action that is not part of this matter of ours will have it rejected.”  
Muslim narrated that Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say in his Khutbah on Friday: “The best of speech is the Book of Allah and the best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The worst of matters are those which are newly-invented, and every innovation is a going astray.” An-Nasa’i added with a good chain of narration: “and every going astray will be in the Fire.”  
In As-Sunan, it is narrated that Al-`Irbad ibn Sariyah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) delivered an eloquent speech to us which melted our hearts and caused our eyes to flow with tears. We said: O Messenger of Allah, it is as if it is a farewell address, so advise us. He said: “I advise you to fear Allah, and to listen and obey, even if a slave is appointed over you. Whoever among you lives will see many differences, so I urge you to adhere to my Sunnah and the way of the rightly-guided caliphs who will come after me, and cling firmly to it. Beware of newly-invented matters, for every newly-invented matter is an innovation and every innovation is a going astray. And there are many Hadiths with a similar meaning. 
Warnings against Bid`ah (innovation) have been narrated from the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and from the righteous Salaf after them, because this is no more than adding things to the religion and instituting a religion that Allah has not ordained, and it is an imitation of the enemies of Allah, the Jews and the Christians, in their additions to their religions and introducing into them things that Allah had not ordained. It also implies that there is something lacking in Islam, and that it is not complete, and it is well known that this leads to great mischief and evil, and goes against the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):  
“This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion.” [Al-Ma’idah 5:3] 
It also goes against the Hadiths of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) which warn against innovation (Bid`ah). 
I hope that the evidence we have quoted will be sufficient to convince the seeker of truth that this Bid`ah is wrong, i.e., the innovation of celebrating the night of the Isra’ and Mi`raj, and that it is not part of the religion of Islam at all. 
Because Allah has enjoined being sincere towards the Muslims and explaining what Allah has prescribed for them in their religion, and because it is prohibited to conceal knowledge, I thought that I should point out this innovation, which is so widespread in many regions that people think it is part of the religion, to my Muslim brothers. Allah is the One Whom we ask to set the affairs of all the Muslims straight, and to bless them with knowledge of Islam, and to help us and them to adhere steadfastly to the truth, and to forsake everything that goes against it, for He is able to do that. May Allah send blessings and peace upon His slave and Messenger, our Prophet Muhammad, and his family and Companions.”

Can you skip fasting during exams? 


Making up missed fasts due to exams


Breaking the fast for no legitimate reason


Delaying making up missed fasts for years","Praise be to Allah.Ramadan fast is the fourth pillar of Islam
The Ramadan fast is one of the pillars on which Islam is based. Al-Bukhari (8) and Muslim (16) narrated that Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Islam is built on five (pillars): the testimony that there is no god except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; establishing regular prayer; paying zakah; fasting Ramadan, and performing Pilgrimage to the House (the Ka`bah).” 
Whoever does not fast has abandoned one of the pillars of Islam and has committed a grave major sin. In fact, some of the salaf were of the view that such a one is a disbeliever and an apostate – Allah forbid. 
Al-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Kabair (p. 64): 
The believers unanimously agreed that whoever forsakes the Ramadan fast when he is not sick and has no other excuse for that is worse than an adulterer or one who is addicted to alcohol. They doubt whether he is a Muslim and they think of him as a heretic and deviant. End quote. 
Can you skip fasting during exams? 
As for breaking the fast because of exams, Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about that and he replied: 
“It is not permissible for an adult of sound mind to break the fast during Ramadan because of exams, because that is not one of the excuses permitted in Islam. Rather he has to fast and do his studying at night if it is hard for him to do it during the day. Those who are in charge of exams should be kind to the students and arrange the exams at a time other than Ramadan, so as to serve two purposes: the purpose of fasting and that of giving students time to prepare for the exams. It is narrated in a sahih report that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""O Allah, whoever is appointed over any of my ummah’s affairs and treats them kindly, treat him kindly, and whoever is appointed over any of my ummah’s affairs and treats them harshly, treat him harshly."" (Narrated by Muslim in his sahih) 
So my advice to those who are in charge of exams is to be kind to the students and not organize the exams in Ramadan, rather to do them before or after that. We ask Allah to guide us all.” (Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 4/223) 
The Standing Committee was asked: I am going to be tested in Ramadan for a period of 6 and a half consecutive hours, with a 45 minute break. I did the same test last year, but I could not concentrate because of fasting. Is it permissible for me to break the fast on the day of the test? 
They replied: 
“It is not permissible to break the fast for the reason you mentioned, rather that is haram, because it is not included among the excuses for which it is permissible to break the Ramadan fast.” (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 10/240) 
Making up missed fasts due to exams
With regard to whether it is obligatory to make up the fasts , it depends. 
If you broke the fast because you thought that it was permissible to do so because of the exams, then you have to make it up, because you are excused for this mistaken thinking, and you did not deliberately commit a haram action. 
But if you broke your fast and you knew that it was haram to do so, then you have to repent and regret this sin, and resolve not to commit this grave sin again. 
As for making it up, if you broke the fast during the day after having started to fast, then you have to make it up, but if you did not fast at all, then you do not have to make it up, and it is sufficient to repent to Allah sincerely. And you have to do a lot of righteous deeds such as observing voluntary fasts etc., that will make up for the shortfall in fulfilling the obligatory duty. 
Breaking the fast for no legitimate reason
Shaykh Ibn 'Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about the ruling on breaking the fast during the day in Ramadan for no legitimate reason . 
He replied: 
“Breaking the fast during the day in Ramadan for no legitimate reason is one of the worst of major sins, because of which a person may be regarded as a fasiq (disobedient, rebellious) who has to repent to Allah and make up for the day when he broke the fast. I.e., if he fasted, then during the day he broke his fast with no excuse, he has committed a sin, and he has to make up that day because when he started that fast, it became binding on him to complete it, so he has to make it up, like a vow. But if he did not fast at all, deliberately and with no excuse, then the correct view is that he does not have to make it up, because that will not benefit him at all, as it will never be accepted from him. The basic principle with regard to acts of worship that are connected to specific times is that if a person delays them beyond that specific time with no excuse, they will not be accepted from him, because the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: ""Whoever does a deed that is not in accordance with this matter of ours, will have it rejected."" And because it is a transgression of the sacred limits of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, and transgressing the sacred limits of Allah is zulm (wrongdoing), and no deeds are accepted from the zalim (wrongdoer). Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And whoever transgresses the limits ordained by Allah, then such are the Zalimun (wrongdoers).” [al-Baqarah 2:229]
If he does this act of worship early – i.e., before the time for it begins – it will not be accepted from him, and similarly if he does it after that, it will not be accepted from him, unless he has an excuse.” (Majmu' Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn 'Uthaymin, 19; question no. 45) 
Delaying making up missed fasts for years
You have to repent to Allah for delaying making up the fasts all these years. The one who owes days from Ramadan has to make them up before the next Ramadan begins. If he delays that, he is committing a haram action, but does he have to offer the expiation of feeding one poor person for each day because of this delay? There is a dispute among the scholars concerning that, but the most correct view is that he does not have to do so, but if he does that in order to be on the safe side, that is good. 
To sum up, you have to make up the fasts if you thought that it was permissible to break the fast because of the exams, or if you broke the fast during the day, but you do not have to offer expiation as well as make up the fasts. 
We ask Allah to accept your repentance.

60299,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/60299,The hadeeth: “The believer is between five hardships…”,"I would like to know whether this hadeeth (prophetic narration) is saheeh (authentic) or not. 

 “The believer is between five hardships: a believer who envies him, a hypocrite who envies him (hasad), a kafir (non-Muslim) who fights him, a soul which contends with him and a devil who leads him astray.” 

If this is a hadeeth, who narrated it?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    This hadeeth was narrated via two isnads (chains of 
    narration). 

    1 – It was narrated by al-Daylami in al-Firdaws, as stated by 
    al-Manawi in Fayd al-Qadeer, 5/292, no. 7352, from the hadeeth of Abu 
    Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him): “The believer has four enemies: a 
    believer who envies him (hasad), a hypocrite who hates him, a devil who 
    leads him astray and a kafir who fights him.” 

    Al-Manawi said, after quoting the hadeeth: its isnad includes 
    Sakhr al-Hajibi of whom Al-Dhahabi said in al-Dua’afa’, he is accused of 
    fabricating; Khalid al-Waasiti who is majhool (unknown); and Husayn ibn ‘Abd 
    al-Rahman of whom al-Dhahabi said he forgot and grew old, and Al-Nasai said 
    he changed. End quote. 

    Al-Shaykh al-Albani said in Da’eef al-Jami’ (4749): It is 
    da’eef jiddan (very weak). 

    2 – It was narrated by Abu Bakr ibn Lal in Makarim 
    al-Akhlaaq, as stated by al-Iraqi in al-Mughni ‘an Haml al-Asfar, 3/63, from 
    the hadeeth of Anas (may Allah be pleased with him): “The Muslim is between 
    five hardships: a believer who envies him (hasad), a hypocrite who hates 
    him, a kafir who fights him, a devil who leads him astray and a soul that 
    contends with him.” 

    Al-Iraqi said:  

    It was narrated by Abu Bakr ibn Lal in Makarim al-Akhlaaq 
    from the hadeeth of Anas  (may Allah be pleased with him) with a da’eef 
    (weak) isnad. End quote. 

    So the hadeeth is not proven.
