    money in the bank in return for interest is a major sin, and it is not

If a Muslim 
    has put his money in a riba-based bank, then Allaah guides him and he 
    repents from riba, then he has to get rid of the interest by donating it to 
    charitable causes, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you 
    who believe! Be afraid of Allaah and give up what remains (due to you) from 
    Ribaa (from now onward) if you are (really) believers.

    if you do not do it, then take a notice of war from Allaah and His Messenger 
    but if you repent, you shall have your capital sums. Deal not unjustly (by 
    asking more than your capital sums), and you shall not be dealt with 
    unjustly (by receiving less than your capital sums)”

It is not 
    permissible for him to benefit from it, either by paying taxes with it or 
    doing anything else that will bring him benefit. 
Based on 
    this, if this road belongs only to him, because it leads to his house, it is 
    not permissible to repair it using this money, because it brings benefit to 
    him. But if it is a public road which will benefit him and others, then 
    there is nothing wrong with using this money to repair it.

60008,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/60008,Types of death announcements and the rulings thereon,What are the kinds of death announcement that are permissible and forbidden? Is announcing the death of a person in the mosque haraam?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: definition of death announcement (al-na’i)

    The word na’i refers to informing people of the death of a 
    person and broadcasting that news. It also refers to matters that may 
    accompany that such as listing the virtues of the deceased. 

    Al-Tirmidhi said in al-Jaami’ (p. 239): al-na’i among 
    them means that it is proclaimed among the people that So and so has died, 
    so that they will attend his funeral. 

    Ibn al-Atheer said in al-Nihaayah (5/85): al-na’i 
    means broadcasting news of the death of a person, and announcing it, and 
    therefore lamenting him. 

    Al-Qalyoobi said in his Haashiyah (1/345): It is the 
    call announcing the death of a person, mentioning his good deeds and good 
    qualities. 

    Secondly: Types of death announcement 

    A death announcement may be a simple announcement, or it may 
    be done by calling out and raising the voice, mentioning the good deeds of 
    the deceased and so on. There is a ruling on both types. 

    As for simply announcing the death, the majority of Hanafi, 
    Maaliki, Shaafa’i and Hanbali scholars and others are of the view that it is 
    permissible to announce a death without calling out, so that the funeral 
    prayer may be offered over the deceased.  

    See: Fath al-Qadeer, 2/127; Haashiyat al-Dasooqi, 
    1/24; Nihaayat al-Muhtaaj, 3/20; al-Iqnaa’, 1/331; Tuhfat 
    al-Ahwadhi, 4/61; al-Sayl al-Jaraar, 1/339 

    Indeed, the majority of scholars are of the view that that is 
    mustahabb. 

    See al-Binaayah Sharh al-Hidaayah, 3/267; 
    al-Khurashi ‘ala Mukhtasar Khaleel, 2/139; al-Adhkaar by 
    al-Nawawi, p. 226. 
They quoted as evidence the report narrated 
    by al-Bukhaari (1333) and Muslim from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased 
    with him), that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) announced the death of al-Najaashi (the Negus, the ruler of 
    Abyssinia) on the day on which he died. He took them out to the prayer 
    place, arranged them in rows and said four takbeers (i.e., offered the 
    funeral prayer for him). According to a report narrated by al-Bukhaari, 
    1328: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) announced to us the death of the Negus, the ruler of Abyssinia, on the 
    day on which he died, and said, “Pray for forgiveness for your brother.”

     Al-Nawawi said in Sharh Muslim: 
This shows that it is mustahabb to announce 
    the death of a person, but not in the manner in which deaths were announced 
    in the Jaahiliyyah; rather it should be done simply for the purpose of 
    notifying people so that they can come to the prayer, and to encourage 
    people to attend his funeral and to fulfil their duty towards him in that 
    regard. The prohibition on death announcements does not apply to this, 
    rather it applies to the jaahili forms of death announcements which includes 
    mention of the good qualities of the deceased and so on. End quote. 

    They also quoted as evidence the hadeeth narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari (458) and Muslim (956) from Abu Hurayrah, that a black man or a 
    black woman who used to take care of the mosque died. The Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) asked about him, and they said, 
    “He has died.” He said, “Why did you not tell me? Show me where his grave 
    (or her grave) is.” He went to the grave and offered the funeral prayer 
    there. 

    These two hadeeths clearly show that it is permissible to 
    announce a death so that people may attend the funeral prayer and make 
    du’aa’ for the deceased. Indeed, they indicate that it is mustahabb, and 
    that it is a means of fulfilling the person’s right to have the funeral 
    prayer offered for him and to attend his funeral. 

    Evidence that it is permissible to announce a death for 
    reasons other than the funeral prayer is the report narrated in Saheeh 
    al-Bukhaari (4262) from Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him), that the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) announced the 
    deaths of Zayd, Ja’far and Ibn Rawaahah before news of that reached the 
    people. He said: “Zayd took the flag and was killed, then Ja’far took it and 
    was killed, then Ibn Rawaahah took it and was killed,” and his eyes flowed 
    with tears, “until one of the swords of Allaah took the flag until Allaah 
    granted them victory.” 

    In this hadeeth, the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) announced the deaths of these three men (may Allaah be 
    pleased with them). That announcement was not made so that the funeral 
    prayer might be offered for them; rather it was in order to tell the Muslims 
    news of their brothers, and what had happened to them in that battle. 

    Based on this, it is permissible to announce a death for any 
    valid purpose, such as making du’aa’ for the deceased, forgiving him and so 
    on. See Nihaayat al-Muhtaaj, 3/20. 

    Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said in al-Istidhkaar (3/26): Abu 
    Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) would pass by gatherings and say, 
    “Your brother has died, attend his funeral.” 

    It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 8/402: 
It is permissible to call the relatives, 
    friends and neighbours of the deceased so that they may offer the funeral 
    prayer for him, make du’aa’ for him, attend his funeral and help to bury 
    him, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    told his companions when the Negus (may Allaah have mercy on him) died, so 
    that they could offer the funeral prayer for him. End quote. 

    As for announcing deaths with loud cries and raised voices, 
    mentioning the good qualities of the deceased, this kind of death 
    announcement was forbidden by the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him). 

    Al-Tirmidhi (986) narrated that Hudhayfah ibn al-Yamaan said: 
    When I die, do not announce it, for I fear that that will be a death 
    announcement, and I heard the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) forbidding death announcements. Classed as hasan by 
    al-Haafiz ibn Hajar; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 

    Al-Sindi said in Haashiyat Ibn Maajah: 
The people of the Jaahiliyyah used to 
    announce deaths in a reprehensible manner, and the prohibition applies to 
    that type of announcement. But Hudhayfah was afraid that what was meant was 
    a general prohibition so he did not want it. This was a kind of precaution. 
    Otherwise, announcing a death, especially if it is done for a purpose such 
    as increasing the size of the congregation (for offering the funeral prayer) 
    is permissible. End quote. 

    Al-Haafiz said in al-Fath: 

    Not all kinds of death announcements are forbidden, rather 
    what is forbidden is what the people of the Jaahiliyyah used to do; they 
    used to send out people to announce the death of a person at the doors of 
    houses and in the markets. 

    Sa’eed ibn Mansoor said: Ibn ‘Ulayyah told us that Ibn ‘Awn 
    said: I said to Ibraaheem, Did they regard death announcements as makrooh? 
    He said, Yes. Ibn ‘Awn said, If a man died, a man would ride his mount and 
    cry out among the people, “I am announcing the death of So and so.” Ibn 
    Sireen said: I do not see anything wrong with the death of a man being 
    announced to his friends and loved ones.  

    The point is that simply informing people of a death is not 
    makrooh, but if it is more than that then it is not allowed. End quote. 

    In Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi it says: 

    The apparent meaning is that what Hudhayfah (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) meant in this hadeeth was death announcements (al-na’i) in 
    the linguistic sense, and he understood the prohibition as applying to all 
    kinds of na’i. Other scholars said that what is meant by na’i in this 
    hadeeth is the kind of death announcement that was known during the 
    Jaahiliyyah. Al-Asma’i said: If someone of status died among the Arabs, a 
    rider would mount his horse and go among the people saying, “I announce the 
    death of So and so,” telling the news of his death. They said that because 
    [?] it is proven that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) announced the death of the Negus, and that he  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) announced the deaths of Zayd ibn Haarithah, 
    Ja’far ibn Abi Taalib and ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Rawaahah when they were killed at 
    Mu’tah. It is also proven that he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said, when he was told of the death of the black woman or youth 
    who used to take care of the mosque, “Why didn’t you tell me?” All of this 
    indicates that simply informing others of a death is not the kind of death 
    announcement that is forbidden, and that in the linguistic sense it may 
    correctly be called na’i (death announcement). Hence the scholars said that 
    what is meant by na’i in the phrase, “he forbade al-na’i” is the kind of 
    death announcement that was known during the Jaahiliyyah. In this way the 
    ahaadeeth may be reconciled. 

    Ibn al-‘Arabi said: From the ahaadeeth it may be understood 
    that there are three types of death announcements. The first is informing 
    the family, friends and righteous people; this is Sunnah. The second is 
    calling people to attend a gathering to show how important the deceased was; 
    this is makrooh. The third is announcing it in some other manner, such as 
    wailing and the like; this is haraam. End quote from Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi. 

    Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmoo’ (5/174): 
The correct view, as indicated by the 
    ahaadeeth which we have quoted and others, is that announcing the death to 
    one who did not know of it is not makrooh, rather if the intention is to 
    inform people so that more will come to offer the funeral prayer, then this 
    is mustahabb. What is makrooh is to mention the good qualities of the 
    deceased and to go around among the people mentioning these things. This is 
    the death announcement of the Jaahiliyyah which is forbidden. There are 
    saheeh ahaadeeth which speak of informing people of a death, and it is not 
    permissible to ignore them. This is the answer given by some of the imams of 
    fiqh and hadeeth. End quote. 

    As for giving death announcements by raising the voice but 
    without mentioning the good qualities of the deceased, some Hanafi, Maaliki, 
    Shaafa’i and Hanbali scholars are of the view that it is makrooh to cry out 
    the news of a death, because of the hadeeth of Hudhayfah quoted above. 

    That is also because calling out and raising the voice is 
    similar to the kind of death announcements given during the Jaahiliyyah, 
    which is forbidden. They used to send out people to announce the news of the 
    death at the doors of houses and in markets. 

    See al-‘Inaayah Sharh al-Hidaayah, 3/267; 
    al-Khurashi ‘ala Mukhtasar Khaleel, 2/139; al-Muhadhdhab, 1/132;
    al-Sharh al-Kabeer, 6/287 

    Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni: 
Death announcements are makrooh, i.e., 
    sending out a caller to announce to the people that So and so had died, so 
    that they will attend his funeral… Many of the scholars said that there is 
    nothing wrong with a man telling his brothers, acquaintances and good 
    people, without crying out. Ibraaheem al-Nakha’i said: If a man dies, there 
    is nothing wrong with telling his friends and companions. Rather they 
    regarded it as makrooh to go around to gatherings announcing the death of So 
    and so, as was done during the Jaahiliyyah. End quote. 

    Some of the Hanafis were of the view that it is not makrooh 
    to call out the news of a death in streets and markets if that it simply 
    calling out the news, without mentioning his good qualities. 

    They said: Because that will increase the number of people 
    who offer the funeral prayer for the deceased and pray for forgiveness for 
    him; that is not like the death announcements of the Jaahiliyyah, when they 
    used to send word to the tribes and announce deaths with screaming, weeping, 
    wailing, eulogizing, etc. See Fath al-Qadeer, 1/128. 
The majority responded to this by noting that 
    the purpose of increasing the number of people who offer the funeral prayer 
    for the deceased and pray for forgiveness for him may be achieved without 
    calling out and raising the voice.

    See Fath al-Baari, 3/117

    As for announcing deaths from the minarets of mosques, we 
    have answered this in question no.

60013,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/60013,Al-‘Ateerah and rulings thereon,"What is al-‘ateerah, and what is the ruling on it?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Al-‘ateerah is a sacrifice was that was offered by the people of the Jaahiliyyah during the month of Rajab. They made that a tradition amongst themselves, like the offering of the udhiyah sacrifice on Eid al-Adha. 
With regard to the ruling thereon, the scholars differed. The reason for their difference of opinion is the difference in the ahaadeeth that have been narrated concerning that. Some of the reports enjoin it or allow it, and some forbid it.  
The correct view, as we shall see below, is that the ahaadeeth which enjoin it or allow it came at the beginning of Islam, then the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade it. 
The scholars differed concerning the ruling on it and there are a number of opinions. 
The first view is that it is Sunnah and mustahabb. This is the view of Imam al-Shaafa’i (may Allaah have mercy on him). He quoted a number of things as evidence for that, including the following: 
1-
The report narrated by Imam Ahmad (6674) and al-Nasaa’i (4225) from ‘Amr ibn Shu’ayb from his father from his grandfather, according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was asked about al-‘ateerah and he said: “Al-‘ateerah is true.” Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 4122. 
2-
The report narrated by Imam Ahmad, Abu Dawood (2788) and al-Tirmidhi (1518) from Mikhnaf ibn Sulaym who said: We were standing with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in ‘Arafaat, and I heard him say: “O people, every family must offer udhiyah and ‘ateerah every year. Do you know what ‘ateerah is? It is that which you call al-rajabiyyah.” Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
3-
The report narrated by al-Nasaa’i (4226) from al-Haarith ibn ‘Amr, according to which a man said: O Messenger of Allaah, (what about) ‘ateerahs? He said: “Whoever wishes may offer ‘ateerah and whoever wishes may not do so.” Classed as da’eef by al-Albaani in Da’eef al-Nasaa’i. 
See al-Majmoo’, 8/445, 446 
The second view is: 
That it is neither mustahabb nor makrooh. This was the view of some of the Shaafa’is, as was narrated by al-Nawawi in al-Majmoo’, 8/445. 
The third view is: 
That it is makrooh, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) disallowed it. Some of them said that it is haraam and invalid. 
They said: The ahaadeeth which allow it and enjoin it were at the beginning of Islam, then they were abrogated by the Prophet’s forbidding of it. 
In Sharh Muslim (13/137), al-Nawawi narrated that al-Qaadi ‘Iyaad said: The command to offer ‘ateerah is abrogated according to the majority of scholars. 
They quoted the following evidence to show that it is haraam:
 1-
The report narrated by al-Bukhaari (5474) and Muslim (1976) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him), according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no fara’ and no ‘ateerah.” 
The fara’ was the first foal born to the she-camel, which they used to sacrifice to their idols. 
2-
The ‘ateerah was a feature of the people of Jaahiliyyah, and it is not permissible to imitate them in their acts of worship because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 4021), classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel, 1269. 
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said after mentioning some of the ahaadeeth which indicate that ‘ateerah is allowed in Islam: 
After quoting some of the ahaadeeth about ‘ateerah, Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The Arabs used to do that during the Jaahiliyyah, and some of the Muslims did that. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) enjoined it, then he forbade it and said: “There is no fara’ and no ‘ateerah.” So the people stopped doing that because of the prohibition. It is well known that disallowing applies to something that used to be done. We do not know of any scholar who says that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to forbid it then he allowed it. The evidence that it was done before it was disallowed is to be found in the hadeeth of Nubayshah: “We used to offer the ‘ateerah during the Jaahiliyyah, and we used to offer the fara’ during the Jaahiliyyah.” The fact that the scholars of all regions are unanimously agreed to disallow ‘ateerah indicates that they were aware of the prohibition. Moreover there are proven reports which indicate that it is forbidden. End quote. 
Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem (R) stated in his Fataawa (6/165) that ‘ateerah is haraam. He said: 
The words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “There is no fara’ and no ‘ateerah” are, as far as I know, show that it is more likely to be prohibited. 
The negative form indicates that something is not valid, as in the hadeeth “There is no ‘adawa and no tiyarah.” Does not saying “There is no fara’ and no ‘ateerah” indicate that they are invalid? 
This is in addition to the evidence: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.” So it is forbidden to imitate the Jaahiliyyah. 
Moreover, this comes under the heading of acts of worship, and the ruling on acts of worship is tawqeef (i.e., they are to be based only on that which is mentioned in the Qur’aan and Sunnah). Even if the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had not specifically disallowed it, it would still be disallowed, because all matters of the Jaahiliyyah are disallowed and there is no need to state a specific ruling on each one of them. 
Some of the scholars stated that it is makrooh, but what we understand is that it is haraam. This is with regard to those who slaughter the first foal born to a she-camel, or offer a sacrifice in the first ten days of Rajab. As for that which they used to do in the Jaahiliyyah for their gods, this is shirk. End quote. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’ (7/325): 
The words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “There is no fara’ and no ‘ateerah” (according to another report: “There is no fara’ and no ‘ateerah in Islam”) indicate that this is a characteristic of the Jaahiliyyah, hence some scholars regarded ‘ateerah as makrooh, unlike fara’, because some Sunnahs were narrated concerning it. But in the case of ‘ateerah – i.e., offering a sacrifice at the beginning of Rajab – it deserves to be makrooh, especially if it is slaughtered at the beginning of Rajab and people have been told that there is nothing wrong with it. For people are inclined towards such things and the month of Rajab is like the month of sacrifice, Dhu’l-Hijjah. The people do that a great deal, so it has become a symbol and ritual. There is no doubt that this is prohibited.
 It seems most likely in my view that there is nothing wrong with fara’, because it is mentioned in the Sunnah, but as for ‘ateerah, the least that can be said is that it is makrooh. End quote.",Islam Q&A
60041,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/60041,"The hadith about Adam’s tawassul by the Prophet, and the meaning of the verse “And seek the means of approach to Him”","I hope that you can explain to me the meaning of the verse (interpretation of the meaning):  
“O you who believe! Do your duty to Allah and fear Him. And seek the means of approach to Him” [Al-Maa’idah 5:35] 
That is so that we may refute what the Sufis say about tawassul, because some of them interpret it as meaning that it is permissible to seek to draw close to Allah by the Prophets and awliya’ (“saints”). With regard to the hadith about Adam committing a sin, they say that al-Bayhaqi classed the hadith as saheeh, and that al-Dhahabi praised his book.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
The hadith about Adam committing a sin and seeking to draw closer to Allah by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is a fabricated hadith which is falsely attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and to Adam (peace be upon him). 
We have stated that in the answer to question no. 34715, where we quoted the scholars’ comments on the falseness of this hadith. These scholars include Imam al-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him). 
Al-Bayhaqi (may Allah have mercy on him) did not narrate this hadith in his Sunan, rather he narrated it in Dalaa’il al-Nubuwwah (5/489), where he classed it as da’eef (weak). After quoting the hadith, he said: “It was narrated only by ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Zayd ibn Aslam, and he is da’eef.” 
What makes it most likely that the text is false is the fact that the du`a by which Allah accepted Adam’s repentance is what is mentioned in Soorat al-A’raaf, where Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“They said: ‘Our Lord! We have wronged ourselves. If You forgive us not, and bestow not upon us Your Mercy, we shall certainly be of the losers’” [Al-A’raaf 7:23]
This is the supplication of Adam and Hawwa’, in which they called upon Allah alone, and sought to draw close to Him (tawassul) by His names and attributes, and by mentioning their situation. These are words which Adam received from his Lord, then he said them and Allah accepted his repentance, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Then Adam received from his Lord Words. And his Lord pardoned him (accepted his repentance). Verily, He is the One Who forgives (accepts repentance), the Most Merciful” [Al-Baqarah 2:37]
Secondly: 
What is meant by the word waseelah [means of approach] in the verse, (interpretation of the meaning):  
“O you who believe! Do your duty to Allah and fear Him. And seek the means of approach to Him, and strive hard in His Cause (as much as you can), so that you may be successful” [Al-Maa’idah 5:35]
is the way of reaching Allah, and there is no way of reaching Him except the way that Allah loves and is pleased with, which is by obeying Him and not disobeying Him. 
Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
Allah commands His believing slaves to fear Him (taqwa). When this word is accompanied by mention of obedience, it means refraining from haraam things. After that Allah says, “And seek the means of approach to Him”. Sufyaan al-Thawri said, narrating from Talhah, from ‘Ata’, from Ibn ‘Abbas: i.e., drawing close to Him. This was also stated by Mujaahid, Abu Waa’il, al-Hasan, Qataadah, ‘Abd-Allah ibn Katheer, al-Saddi, Ibn Zayd and others. Qataadah said: i.e., draw close to Him by obeying Him and doing that which pleases Him, and Ibn Zayd recited (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Those whom they call upon [like ‘Eesa (Jesus) ‑ son of Maryam (Mary), ‘Uzayr (Ezra), angels and others] desire (for themselves) means of access to their Lord (Allah)” [Al-Isra’ 17:57]
There is no difference of opinion among the mufassireen concerning what these imams said.  
Means of approach or means of access means that by means of which one reaches one’s goal.""(Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 2/53, 54). 
Al-Shanqeeti (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
Note that the majority of scholars are of the view that what is meant by waseelah here is drawing close to Allah by obeying His commands and avoiding that which He has forbidden, in accordance with the teachings brought by Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), doing that sincerely for the sake of Allah alone, because this is the only path that leads to the pleasure of Allah and attaining what is with Him and what is good in this world and in the Hereafter. 
The basic meaning of the word waseelah is a path that brings one near to something. Here it means righteous deeds, according to scholarly consensus, because there is no other way of drawing close to Allah apart from following the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Based on this, there are many verses which explain the meaning of waseelah, such as the following (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And whatsoever the Messenger (Muhammad) gives you, take it; and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it” [Al-Hashr 59:7]
“Say (O Muhammad to mankind): ‘If you (really) love Allah, then follow me’” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:31] 
“Say: Obey Allah and obey the Messenger” [Al-Noor 24:54]
And there are other similar verses. 
It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas that what is meant by waseelah is need. 
Based on this, the words narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas, “Seek with Him al-waseelah” mean, seek your needs from Allah, for He alone is the one who is able to meet them. This is further explained by the verses in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, those whom you worship besides Allah have no power to give you provision, so seek your provision from Allah (Alone), and worship Him (Alone)” [Al-‘Ankaboot 29:17] 
“and ask Allah of His Bounty” [Al-Nisa’ 4:32]
And by the hadith: “If you ask, then ask of Allah.” 
Then al-Shanqeeti (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The correct view concerning the meaning of waseelah is that of the majority of scholars, that it means drawing closer to Allah by worshipping Him alone, in accordance with the teachings of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The tafseer of Ibn ‘Abbas comes under this heading, because calling upon Allah (du`a) and praying humbly to Him when asking for one’s needs is one of the greatest forms of worship which is waseelah or seeking to draw closer to Him and attain His pleasure and mercy. 
From this it may be understood that what many of the heretics and followers of ignorant men who claim to be Sufis say, which is that what is meant by waseelah in the verse is the Shaykh who has the power of mediation between him and his Lord, is ignorance, blindness and obvious misguidance; it is toying with the Book of Allah. Taking intermediaries is the essence of the kufr of the kaafirs, as Allah clearly stated when He said concerning them (interpretation of the meaning): 
“[They say:] We worship them only that they may bring us near to Allah” [Al-Zumar 39:3] 
“and they say: ‘These are our intercessors with Allah.’ Say: ‘Do you inform Allah of that which He knows not in the heavens and on the earth?’ Glorified and Exalted is He above all that which they associate as partners (with Him)!” [Yoonus 10:18]
Every one who is accountable must understand that the way to attain the pleasure of Allah and His Paradise and His mercy is to follow His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Whoever deviates from that has gone astray from the straight path. 
“It will not be in accordance with your desires (Muslims), nor those of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), whosoever works evil, will have the recompense thereof” [Al-Nisa’4:123]
The meaning of waseelah that we have explained here is also the meaning in the verse where Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Those whom they call upon [like ‘Eesa (Jesus) ‑ son of Maryam (Mary), ‘Uzayr (Ezra), angels and others] desire (for themselves) means of access to their Lord (Allah) as to which of them should be the nearest” [Al-Isra’ 17:57]
Another meaning of waseelah is the status in Paradise which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told us to ask Allah to grant to him, and we hope that Allah will give it to him, because only one person will be entitled to it, and he hoped that he would be the one.""(Adwa’ al-Bayaan, 2/86-88)
