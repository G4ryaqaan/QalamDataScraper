          Cutting hair to make it all of equal length, reaching 
          the shoulders or ears is OK, so long as that does not involve resembling 
          the kuffaar. Resembling the kuffaar is haraam even if it is in regard 
          to something that in principle is permitted. 
 
          With regard to cutting some of the hair and leaving some 
          of it, that is not permitted. This is the hairstyle which was forbidden 
          by the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), as is narrated in Saheeh 
          al-Bukhaari and elsewhere. 
 
          This ruling applies to both men and women. It is OK to 
          cut the hair and make it of equal length so long as that does not involve 
          resembling the kuffaar, or making men resemble women and vice versa. 
          Women should not cut their hair short in a manner that resembles men’s 
          hairstyles.",Shaykh ‘Abd al-Kareem al-Khudayr
12702,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12702,Is there reward for good deeds in this world apart from reward in the Hereafter?,"Do we get rewarded by allah in this world not only the next..
Meaning allah will reward us in life for doing good deeds and also get more reward in the hereafter..",,,"Praise be to Allah.Yes, Allaah has promised the believer who does righteous deeds reward in this world, as well as the greater reward which awaits him in the Hereafter. 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Whoever works righteousness — whether male or female — while he (or she) is a true believer (of Islamic Monotheism) verily, to him We will give a good life (in this world with respect, contentment and lawful provision), and We shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion to the best of what they used to do (i.e. Paradise in the Hereafter”
[al-Nahl 16:97]
Ibn al-Qayyim said: Allaah guarantees to those who believe and do righteous deeds reward in this world with a good life, and Paradise on the Day of Resurrection. 
The rewards in this life for some good deeds have been mentioned in the Qur’aan and Sunnah. These include the following: 
1 – Spending for the sake of Allaah 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and whatsoever you spend of anything (in Allaah’s Cause), He will replace it. And He is the Best of providers”
[Saba’ 34:39]
It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah says: ‘O son of Adam, spend and I will spend on you.’” 
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4407; Muslim, 993). 
Spending for the sake of Allaah is one of the means of increasing one’s provision. 
2 – Being easy-going with a debtor who is facing hardship, concealing a Muslim’s faults and helping him. 
It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever relieves a Muslim of some distress in this world, Allaah will relieve him of some distress on the Day of Resurrection. Whoever is easy-going with a debtor who is facing hardship, Allaah will make it easy for him in this world and in the Hereafter. And whoever conceals a Muslim’s faults, Allaah will conceal his faults in this world and the Hereafter. And Allaah will help His slave so long as His slave helps his brother.” 
Narrated by Muslim, 2699. 
3 – Being humble for the sake of Allaah.  
It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Wealth never decreases because of charity. No person shows forbearance but Allaah will honour him and no one is humble for the sake of Allaah but Allaah will raise him in status.” 
Narrated by Muslim, 2588. 
Al-Mubaarakfoori said: 
“raise him in status” means in this world and in the Hereafter. 
Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi, 6/150. 
4 – Upholding the ties of kinship 
It was narrated that Anas ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “Whoever would like to have his provision increased or his lifespan extended, let him uphold the ties of kinship.” 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1961; Muslim, 2557. 
With regard to the extension of one’s lifespan there is a well-known scholarly discussion, which is that lifespans and provisions are decreed and cannot increase or decrease. “when their term comes, neither can they delay it nor can they advance it an hour (or a moment)” [Yoonus 10:49 – interpretation of the meaning]. The scholars came up with several answers to this issue, the most correct of which: 
That this refers to an increase of blessing during one's lifetime, being guided to do good deeds and to make use of one's times in ways that will be of benefit in the Hereafter and to make the most of his time for the sake of Allaah. 
The second suggestion is that it refers to what the angels see and what is in al-Lawh al-Mahfooz, etc. For the angels see in al-Lawh al-Mahfooz that a person’s lifespan will be sixty years, unless he upholds the ties of kinship, in which case another forty years will be added to his life. Allaah knows what will happen to him in that regard. This is the meaning of the words (interpretation of the meaning): “Allaah blots out what He wills and confirms (what He wills)” [al-Ra’d 13:39]. 
With regard to what Allaah knows and what He has already decreed, nothing can be added to that; such a thing is impossible. With regard to what people see, they see that it is increased. This is what is meant by the hadeeth. 
And Allaah knows best.

12707,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12707,Tragedy suffered by a girl whose mother’s husband does not fear Allaah,"It is with sorrow that i ask this question.My friend has been raped be her father for many years.She was conceived outside her parent's marriage but they married following her birth.She revealed the rape after she got married.Her father is a religious man with a solid reputation.I ahve heard once that the father of an illigitimate child is allowed to have a sexual realtionship with her because in Islam she is not his daughter,kindly clear me on that matter",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    If what is mentioned in the question is true, then what can 
    we say about a mother’s husband who is so despicable, vile and contemptible, 
    and who is lacking in religious commitment and transgresses the limits set 
    by Allaah? To Allaah we belong and unto Him is our return; there is no power 
    and no strength except with Allaah. 

    Does he not know that Allaah has forbidden a man to marry the 
    daughter of his wife with whom he has consummated the marriage? Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Forbidden to you (for marriage) are: your mothers, your 
    daughters, … your stepdaughters under your guardianship, born of your wives 
    to whom you have gone in”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:23]

    Let alone committing immoral actions with her. Does this man 
    not know of the serious threat which Allaah issues and the painful torment 
    that awaits the zaani (adulterer, one who engages in unlawful sexual 
    relations)? Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And those who invoke not 
    any other ilaah (god) along with Allaah, nor kill such person as Allaah has 
    forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse  
    and whoever does this shall receive the punishment.

    The torment will be doubled to him on the Day of 
    Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace”

    [al-Furqaan 25:68-69]

    Does he not know that committing adultery with one's 
    neighbour’s wife is worse than committing adultery with any other woman? It 
    says in the hadeeth that ‘Abd-Allaah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: 
    “I said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, which sin is the worst?’ He said, ‘Setting 
    up a rival to Allaah when He has created you.’ I said, ‘Then what?’ He said, 
    ‘Killing your child so that he will not eat with you.’ I said, ‘Then what?’ 
    He said, ‘Committing adultery with your neighbour’s wife.’” (Narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari, al-Hudood, 6313).  
Committing adultery with 
    one’s neighbour’s wife is regarded as a greater sin than committing adultery 
    with any other woman, so how about committing zina with someone who is his 
    mahram and is forbidden to him, as this evil man has done?

     Ibn Abi Shaybah said: Question on committing zina with a 
    mahram: Hafs narrated from Ash’ath from ‘Adiyy ibn Thaabit from al-Bara’ 
    that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sent him 
    to a man who had married his father’s wife, and ordered him to bring him his 
    head. Wakee’ narrated from Hasan ibn Saalih from al-Suddi from ‘Adiyy ibn 
    Thaabit that al-Bara’ said: “I met my maternal uncle and he was carrying a 
    banner. I said, ‘Where are you going?’ He said, ‘The Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) has sent me to a man who married his 
    father’s wife, to kill him, or to strike his neck.’” 

    Al-Musannaaf by Ibn Abi Shaybah, 
    part 8, p. 380. Also narrated by al-Nasaa’i, al-Nikaah, 3279; classed 
    as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Nasaa’i, 3123. 

    So how about if he forced this girl to do that, and committed 
    zina with her against her will?

     It is very strange that it says in the question that he is 
    very religious, even though he has audaciously transgressed the limits set 
    by Allaah. We ask Allaah to keep us safe and sound.

     One of the basic principles of Islam which no Muslim has no excuse for not knowing is that zina – with any woman at all – is haraam and is a major sin, and it is even worse if the woman with whom a person commits zina is one whom he is permanently forbidden to marry. We seek refuge with Allaah from the things that earn His wrath and painful torment.",Islam Q&A
12708,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12708,Is it acceptable to marry a girl who has not yet started her menses?,"I have not yet reached the age of puberty. Is it correct that a girl could get married before her menses start, or is that just a traditional myth?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
Marriage to a young girl before she reaches puberty is permissible according to sharee’ah, and it was narrated that there was scholarly consensus on this point. 
1 – Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And those of your women as have passed the age of monthly courses, for them the ‘Iddah (prescribed period), if you have doubt (about their periods), is three months; and for those who have no courses [(i.e. they are still immature) their ‘Iddah (prescribed period) is three months likewise”
[al-Talaaq 65:4]
In this verse we see that Allaah states that for those who do not menstruate – because they are young and have not yet reached the age of puberty – the ‘iddah in the case of divorce is three months. This clearly indicates that it is permissible for a young girl who has not started her periods to marry. 
Al-Tabari (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
The interpretation of the verse “And those of your women as have passed the age of monthly courses, for them the ‘Iddah (prescribed period), if you have doubt (about their periods), is three months; and for those who have no courses [(i.e. they are still immature) their ‘Iddah (prescribed period) is three months likewise”. He said: The same applies to the ‘idaah for girls who do not menstruate because they are too young, if their husbands divorce them after consummating the marriage with them. 
Tafseer al-Tabari, 14/142 
2 – It was narrated from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) married her when she was six years old, and consummated the marriage with her when she was nine, and she stayed with him for nine years. 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4840; Muslim, 1422. 
Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said: 
The scholars are unanimously agreed that a father may marry off his young daughter without consulting her. The Messenger of Allaah married ‘Aa’ishah bint Abi Bakr when she was young, six or seven years old, when her father married her to him. 
Al-Istidhkaar, 16/49-50. 
Secondly: 
The fact that it is permissible to marry a minor girl does not imply that it is permissible to have intercourse with her, rather the husband should not have intercourse with her until she becomes able for that. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) delayed consummating the marriage to ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her).

12713,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12713,Is the trinity that the Christians believe in mentioned in Islam?,"In christianity the word TRINITY is used as the main pillers of the religion.is there any mention of this belief mentioned in Quran.If this is a true belief,will this not come within the perview of SHIRK.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Yes, this belief is mentioned in the Quran, but that is by way of refutation and proving it to be false, and describing the one who believes in it as a kaafir and mushrik. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Surely, in disbelief are they who say that Allah is the Messiah, son of Maryam (Mary)” [Al-Maa'idah 5:17] 
“Surely, disbelievers are those who said: ‘Allah is the third of the three (in a Trinity).’ But there is no Ilaah (god) (none who has the right to be worshipped) but One Ilaah (God —Allah). And if they cease not from what they say, verily, a painful torment will befall on the disbelievers among them” [Al-Maa'idah 5:73] 
“And the Jews say: ‘Uzair (Ezra) is the son of Allah, and the Christians say: Messiah is the son of Allah. That is their saying with their mouths, resembling the saying of those who disbelieved aforetime. Allah’s Curse be on them, how they are deluded away from the truth!
They (Jews and Christians) took their rabbis and their monks to be their lords besides Allah (by obeying them in things which they made lawful or unlawful according to their own desires without being ordered by Allah), and (they also took as their Lord) Messiah, son of Maryam (Mary), while they (Jews and Christians) were commanded [in the Tawraat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] to worship none but One Ilaah (God — Allah) Laa ilaaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He). Praise and glory be to Him (far above is He) from having the partners they associate (with Him)” [Al-Tawbah 9:31]
This is something that is well known among the Muslims, and they are unanimously agreed that the Christians are kaafirs, and even that those who do not regard them as kaafirs are also kaafirs. Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab said concerning the things which are unanimously agreed to nullify Islam: 
“Whoever does not regard the mushrikoon as kaafirs, or doubts that they are kaafirs, or thinks their religion is correct, is himself a kaafir.” (See also question no. 31807). 
We are surprised at the question, in which the questioner appears to think that the shirk which exists among the Christians also exists in the religion of the Muslims. Hence we advise the questioner to read the books of ‘aqeedah which explain Tawheed (the Oneness of Allah) and discuss its meaning and rulings, and also describe the various kinds of shirk. He should also listen to useful tapes on this topic, for this is one of the most important obligations that are enjoined upon people. This trinity in which the Christians believe is not one of the things that lead to shirk, rather it is the essence of shirk. The trinity that the later Christians have fabricated has no evidence in reason and fitrah (the innate nature of man), and there is nothing to support it in the divinely-revealed Books which Allah sent down. 
Ibn al-Qayyim said: 
This is the attitude all the people of misguidance with their leaders and followers. When a monotheist (believer in Tawheed) disputes with the ignorant Christians and points out that their trinity is false and self-contradictory, they say, “The answer is with the priest.” The priest says, “The answer is with the archbishop.” The archbishop says, “The answer is with the patriarch.” The patriarch says that the answer is with the three hundred and eighteen clergymen who gathered at the time of Constantine and enjoined upon the Christians this trinity and shirk which contradicts sound reasoning and religion… ""(Miftaah Daar al-Sa’aadah, 2/148). 
With regard to the word “trinity” (tathleeth) it is not mentioned in either the Quran or the Sunnah, rather the word tathleeth (in the sense of doing something three times) is mentioned by the scholars when they discuss cleaning onself with pebbles after relieving oneself, or when discussing wudoo’, ghusl, washing the dead, saying tasbeeh when bowing and prostrating, asking permission to enter a house, etc. 
What is meant in all of these cases is doing something three times, and it has nothing to do with the trinity of the Christians, which Allah mentions describing their words and commanding them to believe that He is One (Tawheed) and to believe that ‘Eesa (Jesus) is a Messenger and not a god. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O people of the Scripture (Christians)! Do not exceed the limits in your religion, nor say of Allah aught but the truth. The Messiah ‘Eesa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), was (no more than) a Messenger of Allah and His Word, (‘Be’  — and he was) which He bestowed on Maryam (Mary) and a spirit (Rooh) created by Him; so believe in Allah and His Messengers. Say not: ‘Three (trinity)!’ Cease! (it is) better for you” [Al-Nisa’ 4:171]
In this verse Allah referred to ‘trinity and incarnation, and forbade both of these beliefs. He states that the Messiah is only “a Messenger of Allah and His Word, (‘Be’  — and he was) which He bestowed on Maryam (Mary) and a spirit (Rooh) created by Him”. And He says, “so believe in Allah and His Messengers”, then He says, “Say not: ‘Three (trinity)!’ Cease! (it is) better for you”.""(Al-Jawaab al-Saheeh, 2/15)
Some Christians – because of their ignorance – think that the plural pronoun which is used to show respect in verses such as “Verily, We have given you (O Muhammad) a manifest victory” [Al-Fath 48:1] and “Verily, We have sent it down as an Arabic Quran…” [Yoosuf 12:2] is proof of their false belief in trinity. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: 
The view of the salaf (early generations) of this ummah and of its imams and later generations is that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) heard the Quran from Jibreel, and Jibreel heard it from Allah. The use of plural forms in such phrases is the style of Arabic speech used to refer to one who is of high standing and has helpers who obey him. So if his helpers do something by his command, he says, “we did it”. This is like when a king says, “We conquered this land, we defeated this army” and so on. Because he did that through the actions of his helpers. Allah is the Lord of the angels and they speak not until He has spoken, and they act in accordance with His commands; they do not disobey the commands of Allah, rather they do what He commands. Moreover He is their Creator and the creator of their deeds and their power. But He has no need of them; He is not like a king whose helpers do things by their own strength. So what He says when He does something through His angels is, “We did it”, this is more appropriate and He is more entitled to say it than some king. 
This plural form is ambiguous and the Christians try to use it as evidence against the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), when they find such phrases in the Quran as “Verily, We have given you (O Muhammad) a manifest victory” [al-Fath 48:1], etc. But Allah condemned them for ignoring the clear verses in the Quran which state that God is One, but they cling to the ambiguous verses which may be interpreted as referring to one who has a peer with him, or to one who has helpers who are his slaves and creation. They follow the ambiguous verses, seeking to stir up confusion in this manner. This is confusion in the heart, by thinking that there are many gods, and seeking to twist the meaning. No one knows the true interpretation except Allah and those who are well versed in knowledge.""( Majmoo’ al-Fatawa, 5/233, 234)

“I seek protection in Allah besides Whom there is no god, my God and the God of all things. I seek the protection of my Lord and the Lord of all things. I put my trust in the Ever-Living Who does not die, and I ward off evil with (the words) there is no power and no strength except with Allah.

He is sufficient for me. Allah hears those who call upon Him, and there is no object of hope beyond Allah. Allah is sufficient for me, there is no god but He.

Since it has not been proven in any saheeh report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said this, no attention should be paid to it. 
There are du`as which have been narrated in saheeh ahadith which are sufficient, and we have no need for the du`as narrated in weak reports. These du`as protect the Muslim, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) always used to recite them, such as the dhikrs for morning and evening, and other saheeh ahadith. For example: 
1 – Reciting the last two verses of Soorat al-Baqarah every night. It was narrated that Abu Mas’ood al-Badri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The last two verses of Soorat al-Baqarah, whoever recites them at night, they will be sufficient for him.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4008; Muslim, 807. al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “With regard to the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ‘they will be sufficient for him,’ it was said that it means they will suffice instead of praying qiyaam al-layl; and it was said, they will suffice him against the Shaytaan, or against harm. It may be understood as meaning all of these things.’” 
2 – Du`a al-karb (prayer at times of stress). It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say at times of stress:
“Laa ilaaha ill-Allah ul-‘azeem al-haleem, laa ilaaha ill-Allah Rabb il-‘arsh il’azeem, laa ilaaha ill-Allah Rabb ul-samawaati wa rabb ul-ard wa rabb ul-‘arsh il-kareem (There is no god but Allah, the Almighty, the Forbearing; there is no god but Allah, Lord of the Mighty Throne; there is no god but Allah, Lord of the heavens, Lord of the earth and Lord of the noble Throne).” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6346; Muslim, 2730. 
Reciting Soorat al-Ikhlaas, Soorat al-Falaq and Soorat al-Naas. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to recite them when going to sleep, and he would blow into his hands and then wipe them over whatever he could reach of his body. It was narrated from ‘Aa’ishah that every night when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went to bed, he would cup his hands together, blow into them then recite into them Qul Huwa Allahu ahad, Qul a’oodhu bi Rabb il-falaq and Qul ‘aoodhu bi Rabb il-naas, then he would wipe as much as he could reach of his body, starting with his head and face and the front of his body. And he would do that three times. Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5018. 
And it was narrated that ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Aamir said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Have you not seen the verses that were revealed tonight, the like of which has never been seen?

Doubts about impurity","Praise be to Allah.The obligation of removing impurity
The Muslim must beware of impurity and try to avoid it as much as he can. Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) passed by two graves and said, “They are being punished, but they are not being punished for something that was difficult to avoid. One of them used to walk about spreading malicious gossip, and the other used not to take care to avoid getting urine on himself.” (Narrated by Muslim, At-Taharah, 439) 
What is meant is that he did not take precautions to avoid getting it on himself. Hence it is permissible to urinate standing up so long as a person can be sure that he will not get splashes of urine on his clothes or his body. 
Secondly, with regard to the points raised in the question: 
Is Ghusl required if Najasah gets on your clothes?
If Najasah gets onto a person’s clothes, he does not have to do Ghusl, because Najasah is not one of the things that invalidate Wudu’ or Ghusl . Rather Ghusl is required in the case of major impurity and Wudu’ is required in the case of minor impurity. But what he has to do in this case is to remove the Najasah. 
We are commanded to remove impurity from our clothes because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And purify your garments.” [Al-Muddaththir 74:4]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, concerning menstrual blood that gets on the clothes, “Take hold of the soiled place, rub it and put it in water and rub it in order to remove the traces of blood and then pour water over it. Then pray in it.” 
If Najasah gets onto something that can be wrung out, then this is what must be done. 
How to remove impurity
Removing the impurity may be done by washing it until the traces of the impurity have disappeared. So if the Najasah gets onto his clothes, he only has to wash the part of the garment where the impurity is, and he does not have to wash the rest of it. Also, he does not have to change his clothes, but if he wants to change his clothes, there is nothing wrong with him doing that. 
Can you pray in a garment that has some impurity? 
With regard to the ruling on praying in a garment on which there is some impurity , it should be noted that being pure and free from Najasah is a condition of the prayer being valid, and if a person is not free from impurity then his prayer is invalid, because he prayed when he was contaminated with this impurity. So if he prays when he is contaminated with impurity then he has prayed in a manner that is not enjoined by Allah and His Messenger. It was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does an action that is not part of this matter of ours (i.e., Islam), will have it rejected.” 
When impurities get onto clothes, one of the following scenarios must apply: 

When a person is certain that impurity has gotten onto a particular part of his garment, in which case he must wash the area where the impurity is.
When he thinks it most likely that the impurity is on a particular part of the garment.
When a person thinks that there may be some impurity in some part of the garment. In the second and third cases, he should make a decision, and whatever part of the garment he thinks is affected by the Najasah, he must wash it. (See Ash-Sharh Al-Mumti’ by Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 2/221) 

Ruling on a small amount of impurity
Some of the scholars said that a small amount of impurity cannot be overlooked at all.  
However, some of them said that a small amount of all types of impurity may be overlooked. This is the view of Abu Hanifah and was the view favoured by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah, especially with regard to problems that many people face, because it is too difficult to be thorough and to clean it properly all the time. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and [Allah] has not laid upon you in religion any hardship.” [Al-Hajj 22:78]
The correct view is the view of Abu Hanifah and Ibn Taymiyyah. Among the small amounts of impurity that may be overlooked because it is too difficult to guard against it is a small amount of urine in the case of one who suffers from incontinence but tries to guard against it as much as he can. (See Ash-Sharh al-Mumti’ by Ibn ‘Uthaymien, 1/382) 
With regard to what constitutes a small amount, whatever ordinary people consider to be a lot is a lot, and whatever they consider to be a little is a little.  
On this basis, it may be said that the basic principle is that if a few drops of urine get on a person’s garment and he washes off whatever got on it, until he thinks it most likely that the Najasah has disappeared, then whatever is left and is not washed comes under the heading of the small amount of Najasah that may be overlooked, as stated above. And Allah knows best. 
Ruling on not being aware of impurity
Shaykh Ibn Baz was asked about the case of one who is unaware of the Najasah . He said: 
If he does not find out that it is impure until after he has finished praying, then his prayer is valid, because when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was told by Jibril while he was praying that there was something impure on his shoe, he did not repeat the first part of his prayer. The same applies if he knows about it (i.e., the impurity) before he prays, then he forgets and prays wearing (the garment with the impurity), and does not remember until after he has finished praying, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error.” [Al-Baqarah 2: 286]
But if he has some doubts while praying as to whether there is some impurity on his clothes, it is not permissible for him to stop praying, whether he is leading the prayers or is praying alone; he must complete his prayer. (Fatawa Ash-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 12/396-397) 
Doubts about impurity
The issue of not being sure whether the impurity has been removed: if he gets some impurity on his clothes then this is the certain fact and this certainty will remain until the impurity is removed. Then if he is not sure whether he has removed the impurity or not, he should go by that which is certain, which is that he has not yet removed the impurity. The converse also applies, if he is certain that his clothes are pure, then he becomes unsure whether something impure got onto them or not, he should go by that which is certain, which is that his clothes are pure because that is what he is certain of. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said: 
“With regard to a person’s clothes, the basic principle is that they are pure so long as he is not certain that some impurity has gotten onto his body or clothes. This basic principle is supported by what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said when a man complained to him that something happened to him during his prayer – i.e., he invalidated his Wudu’. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him: “Do not stop praying unless you hear a sound or detect a smell.” If a person is not sure about it, then the basic principle is that he is pure. A person may think it is more likely that his clothes have become contaminated with Najasah but so long as he is not certain, the basic principle is that they remain pure.” (Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 11/107) 
The only thing that is not permissible if a person has Najasah on his clothes is prayer, even if he has not invalidated his Wudu’. Other actions such as reading the Quran etc. are not prohibited.

There is the case of children suffering from blood illness and they are in desperate need of blood platelets? Is the ruling the same?

I was told by an imaam that blood should not be given?

Can you please answer with daleel?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about that and he 
    said: 

    “I do not know of any reason not to do that, because Allaah says in His Book 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Allaah does not forbid you to deal justly and kindly with those who 
    fought not against you on account of religion nor drove you out of your 
    homes”

    [al-Mumtahanah 60:8]
So Allaah tells us that He does not 
    forbid us to deal justly and kindly with those kaafirs who are not fighting 
    us and who have not driven us out of our homes, or with those who are in 
    urgent need of help. The mother of Asmaa’ bint Abi Bakr al-Siddeeq (may 
    Allaah be pleased with her) came to her daughter in Madeenah, at the time of 
    the peace treaty between the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) and the people of Makkah, and she was still a kaafir, to ask her 
    to uphold the ties of kinship. Asmaa’ consulted the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) and he told her to uphold the ties of 
    kinship, saying, “Uphold the ties of kinship with your mother even though 
    she is a kaafir.” 

    If a kaafir who has a peace treaty with the Muslims or is under the 
    protection of the Muslims, and is not hostile towards Islam and is not in a 
    state of war with us is in urgent need, then there is nothing wrong with 
    giving blood to him. You will be rewarded for that, because there is nothing 
    wrong with you helping one who is in urgent need of charity or help. 

    From Kitaab Fataawa Noor ‘ala al-Darb, vol. 1, p. 376 
Based on the above, if the kaafir is 
    hostile or in a state of war with the Muslims, then it is not permissible to 
    give him blood, because by doing so you are helping him in his aggression 
    against the Muslims. This is a very serious matter. We ask Allaah to keep us

Can he use it for business and be a guarantor for it?,"Someone left a sum of money with me as a trust, on the basis that he would come back within a short period of time and collect it. But he has not got in touch and he has not come for a long time. I called him on the number he left with me but I did not find him there. My question is: Is it permissible for me to use this money for trade, on the basis that I will protect it and repay him when he asks for it, and will bear in full any loss that happens to this money?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Allaah and His Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah

    says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Verily, Allaah commands that you should render back the 
    trusts to those, to whom they are due”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:58]
And the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Render back trusts to 
    those who entrusted you with them.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1264; classed 
    as saheeh by al-Albaani in Jaami’ al-Tirmidhi. 
So what you have to do is 
    to return the money to its owner. You have to look for him and ask for him, 
    and keep on trying to get in touch with him until you find him. 

    If you cannot find him then you have to keep his money for 
    him until he comes and asks for it. In that case you may give it in charity 
    on behalf of its owner – after doing your utmost to return it to him – then 
    if he comes along one day you should tell him what you have done. If he 
    agrees to the act of charity, he will be rewarded for it, but if he wants to 
    take his money, then you will be rewarded for the act of charity. 

    The Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas was asked about a 
    man who left something for safekeeping with another person and did not come 
    back to collect it, and many years had passed. 

    They replied: 

    You have to do your utmost to find the owner of this trust. 
    If you find him or one of his heirs then give it to him. If you cannot find 
    him then donate it to some charitable cause, with the intention of giving 
    charity on behalf of the owner. If the owner or his heir comes along after

    They replied: 
If the situation is as

    where this man is, or if you wish you may give it in charity to the poor, or 
    donate it to some other charitable cause with the intention that the reward 
    for that should go to its owner. If the owner or his heir comes to you after

          be protected and it is haraam for the mother to harm it in any way,

          rights. So it is not permitted to treat it badly or to abort it.
Shaykh al-Fawzaan said: if the soul has

          aborts it after that and it dies, then she is considered to have killed

          and chin is part of the beard. Removing any part of it also comes under 
          the heading of sin, because the Messenger 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Leave the beard alone”

          serious than removing a part of it because it is a more extreme action

They adhere to the ‘aqeedah (beliefs) of the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). In seeking to understand their religion, they refer to the Quran and Sunnah and the interpretation of the best generations, unlike others who adhere to beliefs other than the ‘aqeedah of the righteous salaf and refer to human reasoning, tastes and what they see in dreams. 
This group is the saved group, the victorious party, which many imams have stated is the group referred to in the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “A group of my ummah will continue to prevail, following the truth. They will not be harmed by those who humiliate them until the decree of Allah comes to pass when they are like that.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1920). 
The imams, in the past and more recently, have said a great deal describing this group. We may chose from among them the following: 
1 – al-Haakim said: 
Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal did well when he commented on this report by saying that the victorious group who will prevail until the Hour begins is “ashaab al-hadith” (the people of hadith).

2 – al-Khateeb al-Baghdaadi said: 
Allah has made these people – Ahl al-Hadith – the pillars of sharee’ah, and He has destroyed through them all abhorrent innovations. They are the trustees of Allah among His creation, the intermediaries between the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his ummah. They are the ones who are striving hard to protect his religion; their light is shining, their virtues are well known, the signs of their sincerity are obvious, their way is prevailing, and their evidence is supreme. Every group has its own focal point which is based on whims and desires, apart from the people of hadith, whose reference point is the Quran, whose evidence is the Sunnah and whose leader is the Messenger to whom they belong; they do not pay any attention to whims and desires, and they do not care about personal opinions. They are content with what is narrated from the Messenger, and they are the ones who are entrusted with it and they take care of it. They are the guardians and keepers of the faith, the vessels and bearers of knowledge. If there is a difference of opinion concerning a hadith, people refer to them, and what they rule is what is accepted and listened to. Among them are prominent faqeehs, great imams, ascetics who are well-known among their tribes, men who are known for their virtue, skilled reciters of Quran and good speakers. They are the majority and their way is the right way. Every innovator pretends to be following their path, and cannot dare to claim any other way. Whoever opposes them, Allah will destroy him, and whoever goes against them, Allah will humiliate him. They are not harmed by those who forsake them, and those who stay away from them will not prosper.

They are the most knowledgeable of people concerning his words and deeds, the most able to distinguish between what is sound and what is not [of hadith]. Their imams have deep knowledge of that, they are the ones who understand its meanings and are the most sincere in following it. They accept it and believe in it, and act upon it. They show love to those who adopt it and they show enmity to those who oppose it. They are the ones who measure any idea against that which is proven in the Quran and Sunnah, so they never adopt any idea and make it one of the basic principles of their religion unless it is proven in that which the Messenger brought. Rather they make that which the Messenger brought, the Quran and Sunnah, the foundation and basis of their beliefs. With regard to the issues concerning which people dispute, such as the attributes of Allah, the divine decree, the threat of Hell, the names of Allah and the principle of enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, etc., they refer that to Allah and His Messenger. They examine the general ideas concerning which the different groups dispute, and whatever of these ideas is in accordance with the Quran and Sunnah, they approve of it, and whatever goes against the Quran and Sunnah, they reject it. They do not follow conjecture or whims and desires. For following conjecture is ignorance and following whims and desires without any guidance from Allah is wrongdoing.""(Majmoo’ al-Fatawa, 3/347, 348).

Imam Ahmad and the majority of narrators say that the person should pray in his impurity, since this is what is within his capability and ability, and that Allah does not burden a soul more than it can bear. The evidence in this situation is what Imam Muslim narrated in his authentic collection of hadith that the Prophet (peace be upon him) sent some people to search for a necklace that Aa'isha had lost, during which the time for prayer had entered, so they prayed without wudu' (due to the absence of water). Afterwards they went to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and mentioned this situation to him. The verse allowing tayammum was then revealed. Sahih Muslim 367
The Prophet (peace be upon him) did not disapprove their action and did not command them to repeat the prayer. A similar situation can happen to patients that cannot move their limbs completely (a paralyzed person who has no one to assist him) or prisoners in some cases of being tied-up or hung-up. The intention is one's prayer should performed and not delayed from its prescribed time depending on his situation and one is not required to repeat it.

Is stunned meat halal?","Praise be to Allah.Is stunning halal? 
If stunning with a blow to the head or an electric shock kills the animal and it dies before being slaughtered properly, then it is mawqudhah (killed by a violent blow) and it cannot be eaten even if its neck is cut after that. Allah has forbidden it in the verse where He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Forbidden to you (for food) are: Al-Maytah (the dead animals — cattle — beast not slaughtered), blood, the flesh of swine, and that on which Allah’s Name has not been mentioned while slaughtering (that which has been slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allah, or has been slaughtered for idols) and that which has been killed by strangling, or by a violent blow.” [al-Maidah 5:3]
The scholars of Islam are unanimously agreed that such meat is forbidden. But if it is still alive after being stunned in the manner described and is slaughtered properly, then it is permissible to eat it, because Allah says at the end of the verse, with regard to animals that are strangled, dealt a violent blow, suffer a headlong fall, are gored by horns or partly devoured by wild beasts (interpretation of the meaning): 
“unless you are able to slaughter it (before its death).” [al-Maidah 5:3] 
So Allah excludes from these forbidden types of meat those that are reached when still alive and slaughtered in the proper manner. They may be eaten because of the effect of proper slaughter, unlike those that die by being stunned before being slaughtered, in which case slaughtering does not render them permissible. Thus it is known that the Quran does forbid animals that have been stunned if they die as a result of that stunning before being slaughtered properly, because the animal that is stunned has suffered a violent blow, and Allah has stated in this verse that such an animal is haram unless it is reached while it is still alive and slaughtered in the proper manner. 
Is stunned meat halal?
It is haram to stun an animal by striking it or giving it an electric shock etc, because that causes suffering to the animal, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade causing suffering and tormenting them, and he enjoined kindness and goodness in general terms, and with regard to slaughter in particular. Muslim narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not take anything in which there is a soul as a target.” And Muslim narrated that Jabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade tormenting any kind of animal to death. Muslim also narrated from Shaddad ibn Aws (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has decreed kindness (or proficiency) in all things. So when you kill, kill well, and when you slaughter, slaughter well. Let one of you sharpen his blade and spare suffering to the animal he slaughters.”  
If it is not easy to slaughter animals unless they have been stunned by a method that will not kill them before they are slaughtered, then it is permissible to stun them and slaughter them whilst they are still alive, in cases of necessity.

12778,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12778,Intuition,Are kashf and ilham true in the light of islam? Sufis every time claim to have the knowledge of the unseen and they call it as kashf and ilham. Some people justify this by saying that when umar (ra) was once giving khutba he told that there is an army in the battlefield. Kindly explain.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
The kashf (intuition, insight, finding out about things that are unseen) that may happen to a person is of several kinds. One type is psychological, which both Muslims and kaafirs have in common. Another kind is spiritual, which comes via revelation. A third type is satanic, which comes via the jinn.                                 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: 
We do not deny that people may experience some kind of kashf, whether when awake or in their dreams when the soul is less connected to the body, either by means of spiritual practices or otherwise. This is the psychological kashf which is the first type of kashf. 
But it is also proven through rational evidence as well as shar’i evidence that the jinn exist and that they tell people things about the unseen, as happens in the case of soothsayers, those who are possessed and the like. 
The second type is that which is done by outside forces, such as the jinn who tell the soothsayers many things. This is something that is well known, especially to those who have experienced it, and we have come to know about these things on many occasions. This is a type of kashf that has nothing to do with the first type, and this is the second type of kashf. 
With regard to the third type, it is what is conveyed by the angels and this is the noblest type, as is indicated by the texts and by rational evidence. Information about the unseen may come from psychological sources, or from evil sources, whether they are satanic or not, or it may come from angelic sources. 
Al-Safadiyyah, p. 187-189 
Ibn al-Qayyim said: 
Partial kashf is something which both believers and kaafirs, righteous and immoral, may share, such as knowing what is in a person’s house or what is in his hand or under his garment, or whether his wife is pregnant with a boy or girl after the gender has been determined, or things that cannot be seen such as things that are taking place far away, and so on. This may come from the Shaytaan sometimes and from one's own self sometimes, hence it may happen to the kuffaar such as the Christians and people who worship fire or the cross. Ibn Sayyaad told by means of kashf the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) what he was hiding for him. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to him, “You are from among the brethren of the soothsayers.” He told him that his kashf was like the kashf of the soothsayers. Similarly the liar Musaylimah, even though he was a kaafir of the worst type, could tell his companions of what one of them had done in his house and what he had said to his wife, because his shaytaan told him that so that he could mislead the people. The same was true of al-Aswad al-‘Anasi and al-Haarith al-Mutanabbi al-Dimashqi, who emerged at the time of ‘Abd al-Malik ibn Marwaan, and others of their ilk, whose numbers are known only to Allaah. We ourselves and others have seen a group of them and people have witnessed the kashf of monks who worship the cross, as is well known. 
Spiritual kashf of this type is like the kashf of Abu Bakr when he told ‘Aa’ishah that his wife was pregnant with a girl; and the kashf of ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) when he said, “O Saariyah, the mountain!” – i.e., stay close to the mountain. There are many such instances among the close friends (awliya’) of Allaah. 
Madaarij al-Saalikeen, 3/227, 228 
Secondly: 
What happened to ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with him) is saheeh and is well proven. Naafi’ said that ‘Umar sent out a military detachment and he appointed a man called Saariyah in charge of them. Whilst ‘Umar was delivering the khutbah one Friday, he said, “O Saariyah, the mountain! O Saariyah, the mountain!” And they found out that Saariyah had moved towards the mountain at that moment on the Friday even though there was the distance of a month’s journey between them. 
Narrated by Ahmad in Fadaa’il al-Sahaabah, 1/269; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 1110 
This was a miracle (karaamah) bestowed upon ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him); either it happened by means of inspiration and his voice reached Saariyah – as is the view of Ibn al-Qayyim – or it happened by means of psychological kashf and his voice reached Saariyah – which is what we will see below in the words of Shaykh al-Albaani. In either case, it was undoubtedly a miracle (karaamah). 
Thirdly: 
With regard to what happens to the Sufis, it is not spiritual kashf, rather it is either psychological kashf which is something that they have in common with the kuffaar, or it is of satanic origin, which is usually the case. 
Spiritual kashf only happens to the close friends (awliya’) of Allaah who establish sharee’ah and venerate it. It is known that the Sufis do not do that. What happened to ‘Umar, although it is correct to describe it as kashf, was spiritual kashf. 
Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
There can be no doubt that the call mentioned was inspiration from Allaah to ‘Umar. That is nothing strange, because he was “muhaddath” (inspired) as was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), but that does not mean that ‘Umar was shown the situation of the army or that he saw them with his own eyes. The use of this as evidence by some of the Sufis for the claims that they make about the awliya’ (“saints”) having kashf and that they can see what is in people’s hearts is utter falsehood. How can it be otherwise, when that is one of the unique attributes of the Lord of the Worlds Who alone has knowledge of the unseen and sees what is in people’s hearts? 
I wonder, how can they make such a false claim when Allaah says in His Book (interpretation of the meaning): 
“(He Alone is) the All‑Knower of the Ghayb (Unseen), and He reveals to none His Ghayb (Unseen).
Except to a Messenger (from mankind) whom He has chosen”
[al-Jinn 72:26-27]? 
Do they believe that those awliya’ are Messengers of Allaah so that it may be said of them that they can know the unseen as much as Allaah tells them?! Glory be to You (O Allaah)! This is a great lie (cf. al-Noor 24:16). 
This story is saheeh and is proven. It was a miracle (karaamah) with which Allaah honoured ‘Umar, by means of which the Muslim army was saved from capture or destruction. But it does not mean that he had knowledge of the unseen, as the Sufis claim. Rather it was a kind of inspiration, in the sense defined in sharee’ah, or a kind of telepathy, which is not infallible. It may be correct, as in this incident, or it turn out to be wrong, as usually happens to people. Hence every close friend of Allaah (wali) must adhere to sharee’ah in everything that he does or says, lest he do something that goes against sharee’ah and thus lose the status of being a friend of Allaah, which Allaah has described in comprehensive terms when He said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“No doubt! Verily, the Awliyaa’ of Allaah, no fear shall come upon them nor shall they grieve.
Those who believed, and used to fear Allaah much (by abstaining from evil deeds and sins and by doing righteous deeds)”
[Yoonus 10:63]
And the poet said: 
“If you see a man flying through the air or walking on the water, but he does not adhere to the limits of sharee’ah,
then you should realize that this is a temptation which is leading him astray, and he is a man of bid’ah.”

The first scenario is where the questioner has prayed Zuhr then he joins them to pray ‘Asr with the intention of praying Zuhr because he has forgotten, then during the prayer he remembers that this prayer is ‘Asr. In this case it is not correct for him to change his intention by now intending to pray ‘Asr. Rather he should stop praying, then say Allahu akbar and re-join the prayer with the imam, with the intention of praying ‘Asr. That is because the intention is a condition of the prayer’s validity. The basis for this (i.e., for the intention being required for prayer) is that whoever changes his intention for one specific prayer, whether it is fard (obligatory) or naafil (supererogatory), to another specific prayer, the prayer he originally intended to pray becomes invalid and cannot be counted as the other prayer for which he changed his intention. Rather he should stop praying the prayer that he initially intended, then say takbeerat al-ihram (say “Allahu akbar” to start a prayer) with the intention to pray the other prayer. And Allah knows best. See al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 2/296. 
The second scenario is where he has not prayed Zuhr at all, and he comes to the mosque and finds them praying ‘Asr. 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: if a person has missed a prayer, such as Zuhr, then he remembers it when the iqaamah for ‘Asr prayer has been given, what should he do? He replied: What is prescribed for such a person is that he should pray with the current jamaa’ah (congregation), but with the intention of praying Zuhr, then he should pray ‘Asr after that, because it is obligatory to pray the prayers in the correct order, and that obligation is not to be ignored for fear of missing the prayer in congregation. 
Elsewhere, he said: the difference of intention between the imam and the one who is praying behind him does not matter, according to the correct scholarly view.

How to wipe over socks in wudu","Praise be to Allah.When to start wiping over socks
With regard to the beginning of the period when one may wipe over the slippers or socks , it begins from the first time one wipes over them after breaking one’s wudu, not from the moment one puts them on. 
How to wipe over socks in wudu
The way in which one wipes over them is to put one’s wet fingers on the toes then pass them over the feet to the shin; the right foot should be wiped with the right hand and the left foot with the left hand. The fingers should be spread when wiping and it should not be repeated. (See al-Mulakhkhas al-Fiqhi by al-Fawzan, 1/43). 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“This means that what should be wiped is the top of the sock, passing one's fingers from the toes to the shin only, and one should wipe with both hands over both feet together, i.e., the right hand should wipe the right foot and the left hand should wipe the left foot at the same time, just as one wipes the ears, because this is the apparent meaning of the Sunnah, as al-Mughirah ibn Shu’bah said, ‘Then he wiped them both.’ He did not say that he started with the right, rather that he ‘wiped them both’. So this is the apparent meaning of the Sunnah.
If we assume that he cannot use one of his hands, then he should start with the right before the left. Many people wipe the right foot with both hands then the left foot with both hands, but there is no basis for this as far as I know. No matter how it is done, wiping the top of the slipper (or sock) is sufficient but what we have said here is best.” (See Fatawa al-Marah al-Muslimah, vol. 1, p. 250) 
You should not wipe the sides or back of the sock because there is no report concerning that. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said: “Someone may say that it is the bottom of the slipper or sock that should be wiped, because this is what is in contact with dust and dirt. But if we think about it we will see that wiping the top of the sock is what makes sense, because this wiping is not for the purpose of cleaning, rather it is an act of worship; if we were to wipe the bottom of the sock that would make it more dirty.” And Allah knows best. (See al-Sharh al-Mumti’ by Ibn ‘Uthaymin, vol. 1, p. 213)

12797,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12797,Does this hadeeth contradict the principle of equality and justice in Islam?,"How sound is the following hadeeth, which was narrated by Abu Dawood and others: “Forgive the people of good character for their mistakes”? I have read that some people are not sure about it because it contradicts the Qur’aan and its verses which call for equality and justice.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    This hadeeth was narrated by Imam Ahmad, Abu Dawood, 
    al-Nasaa’i, al-Bayhaqi and others from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with 
    her), who said that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said: “Forgive the people of good character for their mistakes, except 
    in cases of hadd punishments.” 

    It has other isnaads which are not free of faults, but when 
    taken together render the hadeeth hasan.  

    What is meant by the hadeeth is that it is recommended not to 
    take people of good character to task if they slip up or make mistakes which 
    are out of character, except in cases where a hadd punishment is required 
    and news of the sin reaches the ruler, in which case the hadd punishment 
    must be carried out. 
What is meant by “people 
    of good character” is ordinary people who possess an honourable attitude and 
    other praiseworthy characteristics, those who are always obedient and are 
    known for their good character, but who may slip sometimes and commit sins. 
    This meaning was narrated by Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    who said: The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did 
    not call the pious who worship a great deal “people of good character” and 
    this phrase is not used in the words of Allaah or His Messenger to describe 
    the obedient and pious. It seems that it refers to those who are respected 
    among the people for their status and high position. Allaah has singled them 
    out for a kind of honour above others of their kind, meaning that if a 
    person is modest and of good character, but then he slips up and the 
    Shaytaan overpowers him briefly (and makes him do something out of 
    character), we should not hasten to rebuke him and punish him, rather his 
    mistake should be forgiven, provided that it does not involve transgressing 
    one of the sacred limits of Allaah (for which a hadd punishment is 
    required), because the hadd punishment must be carried out regardless of 
    whether the one who deserves it is regarded as honourable or ignoble. The 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Those who 
    came before you were destroyed because if a nobleman among them stole they 
    would let him off, but if a weak and insignificant person stole they would 
    carry out the punishment on him. By Allaah, if Faatimah the daughter of 
    Muhammad were to steal, I would cut off her hand.” Saheeh – agreed upon. 
    This highlights one of the wonderful aspects of this perfect sharee’ah.

     End quote. 

    From the above it may be understood that the meaning of this 
    hadeeth does not contradict the principle of equality and justice in Islam, 
    rather it encourages overlooking sins and mistakes that are not subject to 
    hadd punishments if they are committed by people who do not ordinarily do 
    such things, and if not imposing a ta’zeer punishment will not lead to 
    further trouble.","Fataawa al-Lajnah al-‘Daa’imah, 22/18-22"
