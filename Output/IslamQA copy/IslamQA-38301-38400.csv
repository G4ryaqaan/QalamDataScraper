38334,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/38334,He has diabetes and does not fast,"I have diabetes and I have to inject myself with insulin twice a day. Hence I do not fast and I pay the fidyah in cash for the number of days I do not fast. It is permissible to pay the fidyah in this way, i.e., in cash, especially since I break my fast in the restaurant and I am not married? Can this fidyah be distributed to three or more poor people, because I cannot find anyone who needs to be fed at the time of iftaar?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.If you are able to fast, then you must fast, and in this case it is not permissible for you to break your fast and feed others. Insulin injections do not break the fast; you can fast and take the insulin injections. And you have to make up the fasts that you have missed. See question no. 1319. 
But if fasting will harm you, or it will cause you great difficulty, or you need to take medicine during the day, then it is permissible for you not to fast in that case. If you will never be able to make up the fasts in the future, then you have to feed one poor person for each day. 
It is not permissible for you to pay the fidyah in cash, rather you have to give food, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And as for those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g. an old man), they have (a choice either to fast or) to feed a Miskeen (poor person) (for every day)” [al-Baqarah 2:184]
So you have to look for poor people so that you can do what is required of you, or give money to someone who can buy food and make sure it reaches the poor on your behalf.

38355,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/38355,Can You Fast the Day after `Eid Al-Fitr?,Is it permissible to make up a missed fast on the second or third day of Eid?.,"`Eid Al-Fitr is just one day on which it is prohibited to fast. As for the second and third days of Shawwal, it is not prohibited to fast on those days. It is permissible to fast it to make up a missed Ramadan fast or as a voluntary fast.",,"Praise be to Allah.`Eid Al-Fitr lasts for just one day, which is the first day of Shawwal . 
With regard to the commonly-held belief among people that `Eid Al-Fitr lasts for three days, this is merely a custom that is known among the people and has nothing to do with any Shar`i rulings. 
Al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
Chapter: Fasting on the day of Al-Fitr. 
Then he narrated (1992) that Abu Sa`id (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade fasting on the day of Al-Fitr and An-Nahr. 
Based on this, the day of Al-Fitr is just one day, on which it is prohibited to fast, As for the second and third days of Shawwal , it is not prohibited to fast those days; it is permissible to fast it to make up a missed Ramadan fast or as a voluntary fast .
