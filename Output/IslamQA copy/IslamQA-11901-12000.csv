11902,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11902,Events that will occur before the Day of Resurrection and distinguish the believers from the kaafirs,What are the tests or trials that may occur before the last day of Judgement which will help distinguish between the Muslims and Kaafirs?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.The Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) told us of signs that will take place before the Hour begins, which the scholars have categorized as “lesser signs” and 
    “greater signs”. Some of them designated a third category, “intermediate signs”, namely the emergence of the Mahdi. This is one of the minor 
    signs, but during his time some of the major signs will appear. 
The Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) has told us of some of the things that will distinguish the believers from the kaafirs before the Day of Resurrection. These 
    include: 

    (a)
    The emergence of the Beast.
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And when the Word (of torment) is fulfilled against them, We shall bring out from the earth a 
    beast for them, to speak to them because mankind believed not with certainty in Our Ayaat (Verses of the Qur’aan and Prophet Muhammad)”
[al-Naml 27:82]
Ibn Katheer said: 
This Beast will emerge at the end of time, when people have become corrupt and forsaken the 
    commands of Allaah, and altered the true religion. Then Allaah will bring forth to them a Beast from the earth.” 
Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 
    3/375. 
It was narrated from Abu Umaamah that the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The Beast will emerge and strike the people on their noses, then their numbers 
    [i.e., those who have been marked on the nose] will increase among you until a man will buy a camel, and they will say, ‘Who did you buy it from?’ 
    and he will say, ‘I bought it from one of those with a mark on their noses.’” 
Narrated by Ahmad, 21805. Classed as saheeh 
    by Shaykh al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 322. 
What is meant by striking the people on their 
    noses is that it will make marks on their noses, and there will be one mark for believers and another for kaafirs. 
It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said: “There are three things which, when they emerge, no good will it do to a person to believe then, if he believed not before, nor earned 
    good (by performing deeds of righteousness) through his Faith [cf. al-An’aam 6:158]: the sun rising from the west, the Dajjaal and the Beast of 
    the earth.” 
Narrated by Muslim, 158. 

    (b)
    The followers of the Dajjaal when he emerges.
It was narrated from Anas ibn Maalik that the 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Seventy thousand of the Jews of Isbahaan wearing large cloaks will 
    follow the Dajjaal.” 

    (c)
    Madeenah will be cleansed of kaafirs and hypocrites at the time of the Dajjaal.
It was narrated from Anas ibn Maalik (may 
    Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no city that the Dajjaal will not 
    enter, except Makkah and Madeenah. He will not approach any of their alleyways but there will be angels standing guarding it. Then Madeenah will 
    be shaken with its people three times, and Allaah will bring forth every kaafir and hypocrite.” 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1782; Muslim, 2943. 

    (d)
    A wind blowing from the direction of Yemen 
It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah will send a wind from Yemen, softer than silk, and it will not 
    leave anyone in whose heart is faith the weight of a grain but it will take him (his soul).” 
Narrated by Muslim, 117. 
Al-Nawawi said: 
With regard to the meaning of this hadeeth, 
    there are many similar ahaadeeth, for example: “the Hour will not begin until it is not said on earth, ‘Allaah, Allaah’”; and “It will not come 
    upon anyone who says, ‘Allaah, Allaah’”; and “It will only come upon the most evil of people.” All of these and similar reports mean what they 
    appear to mean. With regard to the other hadeeth, “A group of my ummah will continue to follow the truth [?] until the Day of Resurrection,” this 
    does not contradict the other ahaadeeth, because what this means is that they will continue to adhere to the truth until their are taken by that 
    gentle wind, close to the time of the Hour or when its portents appear. So the mention in this hadeeth of them remaining until the Hour begins is 
    to be understood as referring to when its portents appear and it is about to begin. And Allaah knows best.

    Haatim al-Taai, some of which are hasan (good), some da’eef (weak) and some mawdoo’ (fabricated). 

    (a)
    It was narrated that ‘Adiyy ibn Haatim said: I said to the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), 
    “My father used to uphold the ties of kinship, and do such and such… Will he have any (reward) for that?” He said, “Your father seeking something 
    and he got it.” 
This was narrated by Ahmad, 32/129, and 
    classed and hasan by Shaykh Shu’ayb al-Arna’oot. 

    (b)
    It was narrated that ‘Adiyy ibn Haatim said: I said, “O Messenger of Allaah, my father used to uphold the ties of kinship, and do 
    such and such.” He said, “Your father wanted something and got it” meaning, fame.
Narrated by Ahmad (30/200); classed as hasan 
    by Shaykh Shu’ayb al-Arna’oot, and classed as saheeh by Ibn Hibbaan, 1/41. 

    (c)
    It was narrated from Sahl ibn Sa’d al-Saa’idi that ‘Adiyy ibn Haatim came to the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) and said: “O Messenger of Allaah, my father used to uphold the ties of kinship, and spend on the needy, and feed people.” He 
    said, “Did he live to see Islam?” He said, “No.” He said, “Your father wanted to be remembered.” 
Narrated by al-Tabaraani in al-Kabeer, 
    6/197. Its isnaad includes Rushdeen ibn Sa’d, who is da’eef (weak), but it is supported by the report mentioned above. 
The phrase translated above and “spend on the 
    needy” means spending on the weak, the poor, orphans and dependents, etc. 

    (d)
    It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar said: Mention was made of Haatim in the presence of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah

11920,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11920,Hadeeths that differentiate between the scholars and the martyrs`,How sound is this hadeeth: “The ink of the scholar is more sacred than the blood of the martyr”?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
The hadeeths which state that the scholars are superior to the martyrs, or that the ink of the scholar is superior to the blood of the martyr, were narrated from a number of the Sahaabah, but they have weak and flimsy, or fabricated isnaads, which we will mention here in brief: 
1. From Abu’d-Darda’ (may Allah be pleased with him):
It was narrated by Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr in Jaami‘ Bayaan al-‘Ilm (1/150). His isnaad includes Ismaa‘eel ibn Abi Ziyaad, of whom Ibn Hibbaan said: He is a charlatan. Hence al-‘Iraqi classed it as da‘eef in Takhreej al-Ihya’, p. 5 
2. From ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas (may Allah be pleased with him).
It was narrated by Abu Na‘eem in Akhbaar Asbahaan (1718) and ad-Daylami in Musnad al-Firdaws. Its isnaad also includes Ismaa‘eel ibn Abi Ziyaad, who is mentioned above.
It was also narrated by Ibn al-Jawzi in al-‘Ilal al-Mutanaahiyah (1/81) via another isnaad. He said: This is not saheeh. Ahmad ibn Hanbal said: Muhammad ibn Yazeed al-Waasiti did not narrate anything from ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn Ziyaad. Ibn Hibbaan said: He narrates fabricated reports from trustworthy narrators. End quote. 
3. From Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him)
It was narrated by ad-Daylami in Musnad al-Firdaws. Its isnaad includes Ishaaq ibn al-Qaasim and his father, who are not known.
It was also narrated by al-Khateeb in Tareekh Baghdaad (2/193) and via him by Ibn al-Jawzi in al-‘Ilal al-Mutanaahiyah (1/80). He said: This hadeeth is not soundly narrated from the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). al-Khateeb said: Its men are all trustworthy apart from Muhammad ibn al-Hasan, and we think that it is something that he made up. End quote. 
4. From an-Nu‘maan ibn Basheer (may Allah be pleased with him)
It was narrated by as-Sahami in Tareekh Jarjaan (p. 91, 222), and by Ibn al-Jazwi in al-‘Ilal al-Mutanaahiyah (1/81). He said: This is not saheeh. As for Haroon ibn ‘Antarah, Ibn Hibbaan said: It is not permissible to quote him as evidence; he narrated such odd (munkar) reports that one cannot help thinking that he is the one who fabricated them. And Ya‘qoob al-Qummi is da‘eef. End quote. 
5. From ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Aamir (may Allah be pleased with him)
It was narrated by ar-Raafa‘i in Tareekh Qizween (3/481). Its isnaad includes ‘Abd al-Malik ibn Maslamah, who narrated odd (munkar) reports. It also includes ‘Abdullah ibn Luhay‘ah. 
6. From ‘Imraan ibn Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him)
It was narrated by al-Marhabi in Fadl al-‘Ilm – as was narrated by as-Suyooti in ad-Durr al-Manthoor (3/423); it is also narrated in Juz’ Ibn ‘Amashleeq (p. 44) with the same isnaad, which includes Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn al-Qaasim, the mu’adhdhin of Tarsoos, for whom I could not find any biography. 
7. From Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him)
It was narrated by Ibn an-Najjaar from him, as was mentioned by as-Suyooti. It is also mentioned in Lisaan al-Mizaan (5/225) via Jarraab al-Kadhdhaab (the liar). 
8. From Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him)
It was narrated in Juz’ Ibn ‘Amashleeq (p. 45) via al-Kalbi from Abu Saalih from Ibn ‘Abbaas; this is a waahin (flimsy) isnaad. 
9. From Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him)
It was narrated by as-Sam‘aani in Adab al-Imla’ wa’l-Istimla’ (p. 181). Its isnaad includes al-Muzaffar ibn al-Husayn, the shaykh of as-Sam‘aani, for whom I could not find any biography. 
To sum up, the hadeeth is not saheeh. Al-Khateeb al-Baghdaadi said concerning it: It is mawdoo‘ (fabricated). Imam adh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Its text is fabricated. End quote from Mizaan al-I‘tidaal (3/517). Ash-Shawkaani mentioned it in al-Fawaa’id al-Majmoo‘ah (p. 17), and al-‘Aamiri mentioned it in al-Jadd al-Hatheeth fi Bayaan ma laysa bi Hadeeth (p. 203). Shaykh al-Albaani said in as-Silsilah ad-Da‘eefah (hadeeth no. 4832): This verdict (i.e., that it is fabricated) is what one feels comfortable with. End quote. Shaykh Muhammad Rasheed Rida said something similar in Majallat al-Manaar (3/698). 
Secondly: 
What appears to be the case is that what is narrated about the virtues of the blood of the martyr in and of itself has no parallel concerning the ink of the scholars. Rather we do not know of any saheeh hadeeth that speaks of the virtue of the ink of the scholars in and of itself, let alone about it being superior to the blood of the martyr. With regard to the blood of the martyr, it is proven that it will come on the Day of Resurrection with its colour the colour of blood and its fragrance the fragrance of musk, and the martyr is forgiven with the first drop of his blood that is shed… And other reports of that nature. But this is one thing, and the superiority of the martyr himself over the scholars is another matter. 
Al-Mannaawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
As a matter of fact, what is narrated concerning the martyr and the special rewards he will attain, and the saheeh reports about the protection against punishment and forgiveness of shortcomings that he will be granted, have no parallel concerning the scholar merely for the knowledge he has. No one can definitively state that the same ruling applies to the scholar. However it is possible that one who attains a higher degree will attain a better reward. 
With regard to the scholar, what should be taken into consideration is the scholar’s character, the impact of his knowledge and what responsibilities he had. We should also examine the character of the martyr, the consequences of his martyrdom and what responsibilities he had. So the comparison should be made on the basis of the deeds of each of them and the benefits of his actions. How often a martyr or scholar warded off or reduced the impact of turmoil and was the cause of relief at a time of hardship. Therefore it may be that one martyr is better than a group of scholars, or one scholar is better than a group of martyrs, each according to his situation and the impact or legacy of his knowledge and deeds. End quote. Fayd al-Qadeer, 6/603 
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
This issue – the superiority of the ink of the scholars over the blood of the martyrs, or vice versa – is an issue that was the subject of a great deal of debate, in which those who favoured each view gave their evidence. 
What may decide the matter and bring about consensus on this issue is the following: 
· Highlighting the different levels of virtue
· Highlighting which is superior
· Examining which of the two is more virtuous than the other (in the light of the above)
These three principles will explain the matter and help us to reach the right conclusion. 
With regard to the different levels of virtue, there are four: Prophethood, siddeeqiyyah (see below), martyrdom and wilaayah (being a righteous close friend of Allah). 
Allah, may He be glorified, mentioned them in the verse (interpretation of the meaning):
“And whoso obeys Allah and the Messenger (Muhammad SAW), then they will be in the company of those on whom Allah has bestowed His Grace, of the Prophets, the Siddeeqoon (those followers of the Prophets who were first and foremost to believe in them, like Abu Bakr As-Siddeeq), the martyrs, and the righteous. And how excellent these companions are!
Such is the Bounty from Allah, and Allah is Sufficient as All-Knower” [an-Nisa’ 4:69]. 
The highest of these levels of virtue is Prophethood and Messengership, followed by siddeeqiyyah. The siddeeqs are the prominent leaders of the followers of the Messengers, and their status is the highest after Prophethood. 
If the pen of the scholar wrote that which is connected to siddeeqiyyah, , then it is superior to the blood of the martyr who did not reach the same level. 
But if the martyr had attained the level of siddeeqiyyah and the shedding of his blood was connected to that, then his blood is superior to the ink of the scholar who fell short of that. The better of the two is the one who is a siddeeq. 
If they were equal in terms of being siddeeq, then they are equal in terms of status. And Allah knows best. 
Siddeeqiyyah is when one attains the level of perfection of faith in what the Messenger brought in terms of knowledge, belief and implementation. This level is based on knowledge. Everyone who has greater knowledge of what the Messenger brought and more complete faith in it will be of a higher level of siddeeqiyyah. Siddeeqiyyah is like a tree: its roots are knowledge, its branches are belief and its fruits are action. 
This is a comprehensive discussion of the issue of the scholar and the martyr, and which of them is superior.  End quote from Miftaah Daar as-Sa‘aadah, 1/297-299 
This argument presented by Ibn al-Qayyim is, in our opinion, more sound and is better than being certain of the difference between the two as being two completely separate deeds, as it was discussed by many scholars.

Is it possible to take loved ones out of Hell, since all requests in Heaven are granted (assuming they know about their fate)?  

Can we also be reunited with our Loved ones in this world who are non-mahrum to us? This includes those that we loved but could not marry.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly, you 
          say, “does this include those whom we loved but could not marry?”  
          
The answer 
          to this is that it is not permissible for a Muslim man to form a relationship 
          with a non-mahram women, or for a Muslim woman to form a relationship 
          with a man or to have an emotional attachment to him, except for her 
          husband. See Questions nos.  9465, 5445, 1200.  
           
Secondly, you 
          say, “Will the people who go to Heaven be reunited with their loved 
          ones who go to Hell?”  
The answer 
          is, yes, the people of Paradise will be reunited with their loved ones 
          who went to Hell, if they were believers in Tawheed (the oneness of 
          Allaah). That will be by virtue of their intercession for them to be 
          brought forth from Hell and admitted to Paradise. The evidence for that 
          was narrated by al-Bukhaari in Kitaab al-Tawheed, no. 7440:  
          
It was narrated that 
          Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri said: “We said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah! Shall we 
          see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection?’ He said, ‘Do you have any 
          difficulty in seeing the sun and the moon when the sky is clear?’ We 
          said, ‘No.’ He said, ‘So you will have no difficulty in seeing your 
          Lord on that Day, just as you have no difficulty in seeing the sun and 
          the moon (in a clear sky). …Then the bridge will be laid across Hell.’ 
          We said, ""O Messenger of Allaah! What is the bridge?’ He said, 
          ‘It is a slippery (bridge) on which there are clamps and (hooks like) 
          thorns which are wide at one side and narrow at the other and have bent 
          ends. A plant with such thorns is found in Najd and is called al-Sa'daan. 
          Some of the believers will cross the bridge as quickly as the wink of 
          an eye, some others as quick as lightning, a strong wind, or fast horses 
          or she-camels. So some will be safe without any harm; some will be safe 
          after receiving some scratches, and some will fall down into Hell (Fire). 
          The last person will cross by being dragged (over the bridge). You (Muslims) 
          cannot be more pressing in claiming from me a right that has been clearly 
          proved to be yours than the believers in interceding with Almighty Allaah 
          for their (Muslim) brothers on that Day, when they see themselves safe.
They will say, 
          “O Allah! (Save) our brothers (for they) used to pray with us, fast 
          with us and also do good deeds with us.” Allah will say, “Go and take 
          out (of Hell) anyone in whose heart you find faith equal to the weight 
          of one (gold) Dinar.” Allah will forbid the Fire to burn the faces of 
          those sinners. They will go to them and find some of them in Hell (Fire) 
          up to their feet, and some up to the middle of their legs. So they will 
          take out those whom they will recognize and then they will return, and 
          Allah will say (to them), “Go and take out (of Hell) anyone in whose 
          heart you find faith equal to the weight of one half Dinar.” They will 
          take out whomever they will recognize and return, and then Allah will 
          say, “Go and take out (of Hell) anyone in whose heart you find faith 
          equal to the weight of an atom (or a small ant),” and so they will take 
          out all those whom they will recognize.’” Abu Sa’eed said, “If you do 
          not believe me, read, if you wish, ‘Surely, Allaah wrongs not even of the weight of an atom (or a small ant), but 
          if there is any good (done), He doubles it...’ 
          [al-Nisaa’ 4:40 – interpretation of the meaning].” The Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Then the Prophets 
          and Angels and the believers will intercede, and (last of all) the Almighty 
          (Allah) will say, ‘Now remains My Intercession. He will then hold a 
          handful of the Fire from which He will take out some people whose bodies 
          have been burnt, and they will be thrown into a river at the entrance 
          of Paradise, called the water of life. They will grow on its banks, 
          as a seed carried by the torrent grows…”
But for those 
          who believed in shirk, no intercession will benefit them. Allaah says 
          (interpretation of the meaning):  
“Verily, Allaah forgives not that 
          partners should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except 
          that (anything else) to whom He wills”
[al-Nisaa’ 
          4:48]
Note that intercession 
          is of two types:  
“The first 
          type is the kind of intercession that is the exclusive preserve of the 
          Messenger 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), which is of varying kinds, 
          the greatest of which is the Great Intercession in the Station of praise 
          and glory (al-maqaam al-mahmood) which Allaah has promised to 
          him in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): 
‘And in 
          some parts of the night (also) offer the Salaah (prayer) with it (i.e. 
          recite the Qur’aan in the prayer) as an additional prayer (Tahajjud 
          optional prayer   Nawaafil) for you (O Muhammad). It may be that your Lord will raise you to 
          Maqaam Mahmood (a station of praise and glory, i.e., the honour of intercession 
          on the Day of Resurrection)’ 
[al-Israa’ 
          17:79]  
This intercession 
          means that he will intercede for the people who are standing on the 
          Day of Resurrection, so that the distress they are suffering will be 
          reduced for them.  
The second type is general intercession 
          on the part of the Messenger 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) for all the believers. This 
          is of various kinds:
(i)Intercession for those 
          who deserve Hell, so that they will not enter it. This is indicated 
          by the words of the Messenger 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “There is no Muslim who 
          dies and forty men who do not associate anything with Allaah pray the 
          funeral prayer for him, but Allaah will accept their intercession for 
          him.” (narrated by Muslim, 2/655). 
(ii)Intercession for those 
          who have entered Hell, so that they will be brought forth from it. It 
          was narrated that Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri said: “The Messenger of Allaah 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘By the One in Whose 
          hand is my soul, 
You (Muslims) cannot 
          be more pressing in claiming from me a right that has been clearly proved 
          to be yours than the believers in interceding with the Almighty for 
          their (Muslim) brothers on that Day, when they see themselves safe.
They will say, “O Allah! (Save) 
          our brothers (for they) used to pray with us, fast with us and also 
          do good deeds with us.” Allah will say, “Go and take out (of Hell) everyone 
          whom you recognize.” Allah will forbid the Fire to burn the faces of 
          those sinners. So they will bring forth many people who were  in 
          the Fire up to their calves or their knees.” (Narrated by Muslim,269)
(iii)Intercession to raise the believers in status. This is because 
          of the du’aa’s of the believers for one another, as the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, making du’aa’ for 
          Abu Salamah: “O Allaah, forgive Abu Salamah, raise him in status among 
          those who are guided, make his grave spacious for him and fill it with 
          light, and protect his family who are left behind.” And there is the 
          du’aa’ for intercession as the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no Muslim 
          who dies and forty men who do not associate anything with Allaah pray 
          the funeral prayer for him, but Allaah will accept their intercession 
          for him.”

11933,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11933,He mistreated his wife so as make her register the car in his name,"Wife had some money from her scholarship which was with her brother. After marriage, she asked him to invest in his buisness and give her the share.Investment was not succesful, so he returned the money later and both husband and wife bought a car with that money. Later they left the country and husband's brother used the car and paid almost only half the price.

The confusion is that :--

Is it unIslamic for the wife to not give that money in husband's hand at the first place? Was it obligatory for her to assign that car to husband's name instead of her own?

Is it Islamic for her husband to misbehave and not fulfil the basic needs of her because of that action.

Is it not husband's duty to be responsible for all basic needs of kids and wife? Is it flexible for him? Is it only sadaqa from his side, if he spends?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    She does not have to give the money to her husband. Her money 
    is hers, unless she willingly gives up something to her husband or her 
    brother or to someone else. She does not have to register her car in her 
    husband’s name unless she has given it to him willingly. On this basis it is 
    not permissible for her husband to mistreat her in order to make her give up 
    some of her wealth. He is obliged to spend on her from his wealth, not from 
    her wealth, and to find her safe and suitable housing, just like any other 
    husband. The same applies to his children. If he spends on them seeking 
    thereby reward from Allaah, he will get that, if Allaah wills, even though 
    that is regarded as his duty.",Shaykh ‘Abd al-Kareem al-Khudayr

11938,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11938,There is nothing good in an act of worship that was not done by the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and his Companions,"Brother my question is fairly long and I hope inshallah you will be able to answer it to the best of your knowledge using hadith and Quranic proof to backup what you are saying and please use as much proof as you possible can.
 See the problem that I am facing is regarding the way in which my parents perform Ibadah and this way that they perform it they would like me to do the same but I personally did not feel that it went in accordance with the sunnah. My parents have a sufistic Qadriyanni belief in which they belief the Prophet Mohammed S.A.W was a Noor and a human. A Sufi Alim who is a Mufti gave my dad a type of Ibadah style book written in Urdu and Dua's in Arabic he told him to do this Ibadah in particular every single day and with Your children who are able to recite Quran and your wife loudly together.
The form of Ibadah goes as following before starting he told us to recite the words
""Allahumma Salliallah Muhamadin Wa'lihi Wa Itratihi beadadikuli malumilaka he refers to it as Darud Qadri
 then he told us to recite these words 100 times ""Subhanallahi wabihamdihi Subhanallahhilazeem Astagfirullahalazimalazi La Illaha Illa huwalhayalqayoom wa atoobu alayhi""
then he told us to recite 7 times surah fatiha  
then he told us to recite 100 times   ""Allahumma Salliallah Muhamadin Wa'lihi Wa Itratihi beadadikuli malumilaka he refers to it as Darud Qadri  
the he told us to recite 79 times Surah allamnashra  
 then recite surah Ikhlas 100 times  
then recite 100 times these words   ""allahuma ya qadiyal hajate  
then recite 100 times these words   ""allahuma ya dafi al balayati""  
then recite 100 times   ""allahuma ya ah lal mushkalati  
then recite 100 times   ""allahuma ya kafiyal muhimati  
then recite 100 times   ""Allahuma ya mujeebadawati  
then recite 100 times   ""allahuma ya shafi mar da'""  
then recite 100 times   ""Allahuma ya khayranaseereena""  
then recite 100 times   ""Bihrahmatikaya ya arhamarahimeen  
then recite 100 times   ""Allahuma ameen""  
the 2nd part to this Ibadah is the same thing accept some things changed around such as starting off with the words ""hazbunallahu"" 500 times and following it through the same way acept without Surah Allahmnashra or Ikhlas.
Now I know some of these words are in the Quran and the surahs are for sure but I would like to know the meanings for everything english translation i'm sorry i cannot find it in arabic but try to soundout the meaning please. I would like to know if this form of Ibadah is in accordance with the Sunnah. If the Prophet Mohammed (S.A.W) ever recited it. My parents want me to do the Ibadah with them and they get very angry even if i question it the slightest bit because they say what do you know your so young. The alim who came has been studying for more then 60 years who are you to question them. So brother please answer my question in as much depth as possible and as much proof you can possibly have if this Dua is sunnah or just an innovation. As well i forgot to mention there is this other thing my parents want me to do after i do this supplication   which is that i recite Surah 105 in the Quran and when it gets to a part where you say tarmihim to say tarmeem and take these rocks one by one bouncing them off of a metal bowl turned upside down covered with a red sheet to represent blood. My parents tell me this is to ask allah to strike down on the enemies of ours killing them off or something close to that. I would like to know of this is the sunnah of the Prophet MOhammed (S.A.W) or if its an innovation please provide lots of proof and be as clear as possible so my parents will understand. I know I am asking for a lot but I would really appreciate if you could answer me as soon as possible.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The purpose for which we were created is to worship Allah alone with no partner or associate, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And I (Allah) created not the jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone)”
[al-Dhaariyaat 51:56] 
Allah has not left us each to choose his own way of worship, rather He has sent His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and revealed His holy Book, to show people the way and guide them. So there is nothing that is worship and goodness and guidance that Allah loves, but it has been explained by the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
No two Muslims dispute that Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the best and most pious of mankind, the one who worshipped Allah and turned to Him the most. Hence the one who is truly guided is the one who follows his path and walks in his footsteps. 
Adhering to the path of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is not something that is optional, rather it is an obligation that Allah has enjoined upon His slaves, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And whatsoever the Messenger (Muhammad) gives you, take it; and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it). And fear Allah; verily, Allah is Severe in punishment”
[al-Hashr 59:7] 
“It is not for a believer, man or woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decreed a matter that they should have any option in their decision. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, he has indeed strayed into a plain error”
[al-Ahzaab 33:36] 
“Indeed in the Messenger of Allah (Muhammad) you have a good example to follow for him who hopes for (the Meeting with) Allah and the Last Day”
[al-Ahzaab 33:21] 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stated that every innovated kind of worship would be rejected and thrown back at the one who does it, no matter what it is. He said: “Every action that is not in accordance with this matter of ours [i.e., Islam] will be rejected.” Narrated by Muslim, 1718, from the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her). 
No deed will be accepted unless it is done sincerely for the sake of Allah and in accordance with the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). This is what is meant by the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“that He may test you which of you is best in deed”
[al-Mulk 67:2] 
Al-Fudayl ibn ‘Iyyaad said: (This means) that which is most sincere and most correct. They said, O Abu ‘Ali, what most sincere and most correct? He said: If a deed is not sincere and not correct, it will not be accepted. If it is correct but is not sincere, it will not be accepted unless it is both sincere and correct. Sincere means that it is done for the sake of Allah and correct means that it is in accordance with the Sunnah. 
Whoever wants to attain the pleasure of Allah, he has to adhere to the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). All paths to Allah are blocked, except this path, the path of His Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
Because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was compassionate towards his ummah and cared deeply for them, he did not leave anything good without explaining it to them. So whoever today invents an act of worship, dhikr or wird and claims that it is good, is accusing the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) – whether he realizes it or not – of not conveying the religion as Allah commanded him to do. Hence Imam Maalik (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Whoever introduces any innovation into Islam claiming that it is good is implying that Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) betrayed the message entrusted to him, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):  
“This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion”
[al-Maa'idah 5:3] 
So whatever was not part of the religion of Islam at that point should never be part of the religion of Islam today. 
The Sahaabah, Taabi’een and imams issued many warnings against innovation. 
Hudhayfah ibn al-Yamaan said: Every act of worship which the companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not do, do not do it. 
Ibn Mas’ood said: Follow and do not innovate, for the religion is complete. Adhere to the old way (i.e., the way of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the Sahaabah) 
The question which should be put to the one who invented this dhikr is: 
Did the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) do this? Did the Sahaabah do this? 
The obvious answer is that reciting these soorahs these number of times – 100 times or 7 or 79 – is something that was not narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), or from any of his companions. The same is true of the du’aa’s recited in this manner for the number of times mentioned. 
It should be said to this innovator: do you think that you have discovered something good that was not known to the Prophet or his companions? 
Or do you think that you or your shaykh have the right to introduce new laws and to define news dhikrs and when they should be said and how often they should be repeated, just as the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had that right? 
Undoubtedly both of these are manifest misguidance. 
Let us think about the report narrated from ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ood by al-Daarimi in his Sunan, according to which Abu Moosa al-Ash’ari said to ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ood: “O Abu ‘Abd al-Rahmaan, I have just seen in the mosque something new that I was not sure about, but I think I have not seen anything but something good, praise be to Allah.” He said, “What was it?” 
He said, “You will see it tomorrow.” He said, “I saw some people in the mosque sitting in circles waiting for the prayer. In every circle there was a man and in their hands were pebbles. He would say, ‘Say Allahu akbar one hundred times,’ so they would say Allahu akbar (takbeer) one hundred times. Then he would say, ‘Say Laa ilaaha ill-Allah (tahleel) one hundred times, so they would say Laa ilaaha ill-Allah one hundred times. Then he would say, ‘Say Subhaan Allah (tasbeeh) one hundred times,’ and they would say Subhaan Allah one hundred times.” 
He said, “What did you say to them?” 
He said, “I did not say anything to them. I was waiting for your opinion.” 
He said, “Why did you not tell them to count their bad deeds and promise them that none of their good deeds would be lost?’ Then he went away and we went with him, until he came to one of those circles. He stood over them and said, “What is this that I see you doing?” 
They said, “O Abu ‘Abd al-Rahmaan, these are pebbles with which we count the takbeer, tahleel and tasbeeh.” 
He said, “Count your bad deeds, for I promise you that nothing of your good deeds will be lost. Woe to you, O ummah of Muhammad, how soon you have drifted into the way of doom even though the companions of your Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) are still alive amongst you, and his garments and the vessels he used are still not worn out or broken. By the One in Whose hand is my soul, either you are following a way that is more guided than the way of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), or you are starting a way that is the way of misguidance.”  
They said, “By Allah, O Abu ‘Abd al-Rahmaan, we did not intend anything but good.” 
He said, “How many of those who intend good never attain it.” 
Not everyone who seeks or intends good attains it and is guided to it. Not every act of worship is accepted, unless it is in accordance with the Sunnah of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
This denunciation by Ibn Mas’ood (may Allah be pleased with him) puts an end to the argument presented by innovators, because they always say, “What reason can there be not to recite dhikr, prayers and Qur’aan? We only intend good and to draw closer to Allah.” 
It should be said to them: Worship must be something that is prescribed in sharee’ah in essence and in its form and the manner in which it is done. If a specific number is prescribed in sharee’ah then no one has the right to go beyond that, and if no number or way is specified then no one has the right to invent a limit for it, because that implies that one is assuming the role of a lawgiver.  
This is further supported by the report narrated from Sa’eed ibn al-Musayyib (may Allah have mercy on him). He saw a man praying more than two rak’ahs after dawn had come (i.e., Fajr), and he told him not to do that. The man said, “O Abu Muhammad, will Allah punish me for praying?!” 
He said, “No, but He will punish you for going against the Sunnah.” 
Look at the understanding of this great Taabi’i, may Allah have mercy on him. That is because the regular Sunnah is to pray only two rak’ahs after the dawn has come, not more than that, then to pray the obligatory prayer of Fajr. 
A similar report was narrated from Imam Maalik (may Allah have mercy on him). A man came to him and said: “O Abu ‘Abd-Allah, from where should I enter ihraam?”
 He said, “From Dhu’l-Hulayfah, from where the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) entered ihraam.” 
He said, “I want to enter ihraam from the Mosque, from near the grave (meaning the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)).” 
He said, “Do not do that, for I fear fitnah (trial, affliction) for you.” 
He said, “What fitnah is that? It is just a few miles I am adding.”  
He said, “What fitnah is greater than your thinking that you have found something good that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) failed to do?! I heard that Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
‘And let those who oppose the Messenger’s (Muhammad’s) commandment (i.e. his Sunnah legal ways, orders, acts of worship, statements) (among the sects) beware, lest some Fitnah (disbelief, trials, afflictions, earthquakes, killing, overpowered by a tyrant) should befall them or a painful torment be inflicted on them’
[al-Noor 24:63].” 
This is the understanding of the Sahaabah, Taabi’een and Imams. As for the people of bid’ah, they say, “What fitnah? It is only dhikr and prayer and a few miles by which we seek to draw closer to Allah.” 
No wise person should be deceived by the words of these people, for the Shaytaan has made their deeds appear attractive to them, and they hate to go against their shaykhs and the leaders of their tareeqahs. 
Sufyaan ibn ‘Uyaynah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Bid’ah (innovation) is dearer to Iblees (Satan) than sin, because a person may repent from sin, but not from innovation. 
It should be noted that no one ever invents a bid’ah but he forsakes thereby a Sunnah that is equal to it or greater than it. Hence those who favour innovated dhikrs are the most ignorant of people about the Prophet’s dhikr which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) persisted in reciting. You will rarely find any of them who says in the morning and evening, Subhaan-Allah wa bi hamdihi (Glory and praise be to Allah) one hundred times; or Asbahna ‘ala fitrat il-Islam wa kalimat il-ikhlaas wa deeni nabiyyina Muhammad sall-Allahu ‘alay wa sallim wa millati abeena Ibraaheema haneefan wa maa kaana min al-mushrikeen (We have awoken on the fitrah of Islam and the word of sincerity and the religion of our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the religion of our father Ibraaheem, pure monotheism, and he was not of those who associate others with Allah); or Asbahna wa asbah al-mulk Lillaahi Rabb il-‘Aalameen. Allahumma inni as’aluka khayra hadha’l-yawm fa-thahu wa nasrahu wa noorahu wa barakatahu wa hudaahu, wa a’oodhu bika min sharri ma fihi wa sharri ma ba’dahu (We have awoken and dominion belongs to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds. O Allah I ask You for the good of this day and its goodness, support, help, light, blessing and guidance. And I seek refuge with You from the evil of what is in it and the evil of what comes after it): or Subhaan Allah ‘adada khalqihi, Subhaan Allah ridaa nafsihi, Subhaan Allah zinata ‘arshihi, Subhaan Allah midaada kalimaatihi (Glory be to Allah the number of His creation, Glory be to Allah as much as He is pleased with, Glory be to Allah the weight of His Throne, Glory be to Allah the extent of His words). 
And there are other dhikrs with which you may be content, from the books that contain the dhikrs for the morning and the evening, etc. 
The point is that it is not permissible to join your parents in these innovated dhikrs and say them the number of times you mention. 
With regard to what you mentioned about Soorat al-Feel and throwing stones when saying tarmeehim (striking them), this is a myth and is nonsense. It is not permissible to do this or to seek to draw closer to Allah by doing it. How many enemies did the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) confront, and he did not pray against them in this manner. There is the fear that this is a way of drawing closer to the devils and seeking their help.
 
 
With regard to the belief that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was light (noor), there is no basis for this and it was not narrated either in the Qur’aan or saheeh Sunnah. Allah has told us that the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was a human being like us, except that Allah favoured him with revelation and the message. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say (O Muhammad): ‘I am only a man like you. It has been revealed to me that your Ilaah (God) is One Ilaah (God i.e. Allah)’”
[al-Kahf 18:110] 
“Say (O Muhammad): ‘I am only a human being like you. It is revealed to me that your Ilaah (God) is One Ilaah (God — Allah), therefore take Straight Path to Him (with true Faith Islamic Monotheism) and obedience to Him, and seek forgiveness of Him. And woe to Al‑Mushrikoon (the polytheists, idolaters, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah)’”
[Fussilat 41:6] 
Some of the extreme Sufis believe that he was light, and that he was the first thing created by Allah, and that the rest of creation was created from his light. This is a lie and is misguidance for which they have no evidence apart from a false, fabricated hadeeth.  
We ask Allah to help you and your parents to avoid innovation and its people. 
And Allah knows best.",Islam Q&A
11941,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11941,Using medicines manufactured from animal products,"A sister who has just finished studying hoeopathic medicine and who is now practicing has the following questions :
1. Can Muslims use animal organs/products for medicine? For example, injectable insulin made from pig tissue/medicine containing liver from cows or other organs from cows. Also what about medicines which contain extracts from animal hormones?
2. Can a Muslim doctor administer the above medicines to Muslims or non-Muslims?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The production of medicines from non-animal sources may be of two types: 
1.Where they are made from permissible materials, so they are permissible, such as making them from permissible herbs.
2.Where they are made from materials which are haram (forbidden) or naajis (impure), so the medicine is haram according to the consensus of the fuqahaa’, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah does not put your cure in that which He has forbidden to you.” (narrated by al-Bukhari in a mu’allaq report; al-Fath, vol. 1, p. 78) 
See al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, vol. 11, p. 118 
If the medicine is made from animal sources, it may be one of three types:  
1.If it comes from an animal whose meat may be eaten and it has been slaughtered correctly, then it is permissible to use it as medicine.
2.If it comes from an animal whose meat may be eaten but it has not been slaughtered correctly, then it is not permissible to use it for medicine, because it is haram. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah does not put your cure in that which He has forbidden to you.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari in his Saheeh, in a mu’allaq report from Ibn Mas’ood (may Allah be pleased with him), in Kitaab al-Ashribah).
3.If it comes from an animal whose meat cannot be eaten, then it is not permissible to use it as medicine, for the reasons stated above. This includes pork. 
Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Section: it is not permissible to treat disease with haram things, or anything that contains haram things, such as the milk of female donkeys, or the meat of something that is haram, or to drink wine in order to treat disease, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Allah does not put the cure for my ummah in that which He has forbidden to them.’ And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, when he was told about nabeedh (date wine) that was used for medicinal purposes, ‘It is not a cure, it is a disease.’” (al-Mughni, vol. 9, p. 338) 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Fataawa al-Kubra (vol. 3, p. 6): “Question: is it permissible to treat disease with alcohol? 
The answer: 
Treating disease with alcohol is haram, as stated by the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). This is the view of the vast majority of scholars. It was narrated in al-Saheeh that he was asked about alcohol that was made for medicinal purposes, and he said: ‘It is a disease, it is not a cure.’ And in al-Sunan it is narrated that he said: ‘It is forbidden to treat disease with khabeeth (evil) things.’ Ibn Mas’ood said: ‘Allah does not put your cure in that which He has forbidden to you.’ Ibn Hibbaan narrated in his Saheeh that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Allah does not put the cure for my ummah in that which He has forbidden to them.’ In al-Sunan it is narrated that he was asked about frogs which were used for medicinal purposes. He forbade killing them, and said, ‘Their croaking is tasbeeh (glorification of Allah).’  
This is not like eating dead meat out of necessity, for that achieves the purpose of keeping the person alive when he has no alternative; eating it in this case is obligatory, and if a person is forced by necessity to eat dead meat, but he does not eat it and dies as a result, he will go to Hell. But in the case of treating disease, the cure is not certain and this is not the only medicine which one may take, rather Allah may bring about a person's recovery through a variety of means. Treating disease is not obligatory according to the majority of scholars, so there is no analogy in this case. And Allah knows best. 
Based on the above, the answer to the second question is as follows: 
2 – it is not permissible for a doctor to use haram medications in treating disease.

Shaykh Sa’d al-Humayd 
Rather it is proven in the saheeh hadith that the gathering will be in al-Shaam (Greater Syria, including Palestine). It was narrated from Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Al-Shaam is the land of the gathering and the resurrection.” (Narrated by Ahmad). 
Al-Manaawi said in Fath al-Qadeer: “i.e., it is the place where the people will be gathered for the Reckoning. They will be resurrected from their graves then they will be driven to that land. It has been singled out for this because it is the land of which Allah said (interpretation of the meaning): ‘the land which We have blessed for the ‘Aalameen (mankind and jinn)’ [al-Anbiya’ 21:71].  Most of the Prophets were sent from that land and their laws spread throughout the world, so it is appropriate that it should be the land of the gathering and the resurrection.” (Fayd al-Qadeer by al-Manaawi, vol. 4, p. 171).

“Yes, this is permissible, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Seek healing , O slaves of Allah, but do not seek it in that which is prohibited, for Allah does not make the healing of my Ummah in that which He has forbidden to it.” 
Seeking healing with herbs comes under the heading of permissible things. This does not contradict the idea of putting one’s trust in Allah (Tawakkul) .
It was narrated in the Hadith that a man said, “O Messenger of Allah, what do you think of medicines with which we seek healing , and Ruqyahs (incantations) which we use  for healing – do they change the decree of Allah?” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “They are part of the decree of Allah,” i.e., Allah decrees that a person falls sick, then He decrees that this disease needs treatment, and that if it is treated with medicines or herbs, he may be healed by Allah’s leave.
So there is no reason why we should not use these medicines, including the use of needles and herbs.” 
Is Acupuncture Allowed in Islam?
With regard to the “Chinese needles” (i.e., acupuncture ), if it is proven that this is beneficial, or if its benefit outweighs its harm – if it causes any harm – then there is nothing wrong with using this.

Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was asked: If I enter the mosque and the muezzin is giving the call to prayer, is it better to pray tahiyyat al-masjid or to repeat after the muezzin?
 He replied: 
That depends. If you enter when the muezzin is giving the call for Jumu’ah prayer, the adhaan that is given when the khateeb is on the minbar, in this case we say that you should hasten to pray Tahiyyat al-masjid, and you should not wait until the muezzin has finished, because preparing yourself to listen to the khutbah is more important than repeating after the muezzin, as listening to the khutbah is obligatory and responding to the muezzin is not obligatory. 
But if the adhaan is not for Jumu’ah prayer, then it is better for you to remain standing until you have responded to the muezzin, and offered the well-known du’aa’ after the adhaan:

I ask Allaah to help us and you remain steadfast in adhering to it until we die. 
I give you the glad tidings of the words that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to the Sahaabah: “There will come a time when patience is required of the one who adheres (to Islam), and he will have the reward of fifty of you.” They said, “Of them?” He said, “No, of you.”
(Narrated by Ibn Nasr; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Silsilat al-Saheehah, 494) 
Before you think of divorce, try to play the role of a daa’iyah, calling your husband and those around you to Islam. This will benefit others and help you to remain steadfast. You have an example of that in the righteous believing women such as Umm al-Mu’mineen (the Mother of the Believers) Khadeejah (may Allaah be pleased with her), who played a great role in making the heart of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) remain firm and steadfast when his mission began. Whenever he mentioned her after she had died, he would praise her in glowing terms, as was narrated by ‘Aa’ishah who said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) mentioned Khadeejah one day, and he praised her highly.”
(Musnad al-Imam Ahmad, 24684; classed as hasan by al-Haythami in al-Majma’) 
Another example is Umm Sulaym (may Allaah be pleased with her). Abu Talhah [who was not yet a Muslim at that time] proposed marriage to her, and she said: “By Allaah, O Abu Talhah, a man like you is not to be refused, but you are a kaafir man and I am a Muslim woman. It is not permissible for me to marry you, but if you become Muslim, that will be my mahr (dowry).” So he became Muslim, and that was her mahr.
(Narrated by al-Nasaa’i, 3341; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Nasaa’i, 3133)                                                  
So start – may Allaah help you – by calling your husband and convincing him by all kinds of means to adhere to Islam and its obligations, such as prayer, wearing hijaab, etc, especially since he is already Muslim. Calling one’s husband is one of the ways that lead to Paradise. 
I hope that Allaah will guide your husband through your sincere advice. Also make a lot of du’aa’ for him. If after some time you do not see any improvement, or you think that you will be able to find someone to marry who is better than this husband, then think of divorce. This is only if this man is negligent about his prayers, praying sometimes and not at other times. But if he has forsaken prayer altogether and does not even pray on his own, then it is not permissible for you to stay with him, because forsaking prayer constitutes disbelief in Allaah. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The covenant that stands between us and them is prayer; whoever gives it up is a kaafir.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2621; al-Nasaa’i, 463 and others. It is a saheeh report. Al-Mishkaat, 574) 
And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Between a man and shirk and kufr, there stands his giving up prayer.”
(Narrated by Muslim, 82). 
For yourself, be patient in adhering to hijaab even though it may be difficult. How much did our examples, the men and women of the Sahaabah, suffer for the sake of Allaah; we suffer only a fraction of what they suffered. This is the path to Paradise. For Hell is surrounded with whims and desires and Paradise is surrounded with difficulties. 
Be certain that hijaab is only difficult because it is new to you. If you are patient and have faith, this difficulty will fade – in sha Allaah – and it will become easy and you will become comfortable with the hijaab. If you remember the reward, that which is difficult will become easier. 
The fact that you are wearing hijaab even though you find it difficult is a sign that your faith is strong.
 I ask Allaah to make us and you steadfast in adhering to the religion. Ameen.",Islam Q&A

11971,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11971,He is in love with a Christian woman at the expense of his wife,"A young man is in love with a Christian woman for whom he cares, but he feels guilty. He wants to leave his first wife (the mother of his children) and call this Christian woman to Islam, then when she becomes Muslim he will marry her.

Leaving his first wife does not mean divorcing her, lest that affect his young children. His first wife is very angry and upset.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    The questioner has done very well by seeking to advise his 
    friend in the light of Islamic teachings. This is an example of perfect love 
    and Islamic brotherhood. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “Religion is sincerity (or sincere advice).” (Narrated by 
    Imam Muslim). If such good care was widespread among the Muslims their 
    situation would be far better than what we see now, especially in countries 
    where Islam and its followers are strangers. The Muslim is in great need of 
    his Muslim brother to give him advice and to love for his brother what he 
    loves for himself. Perhaps a kind word or sincere advice that a man gives 
    and pays little attention to may earn him the pleasure of Allaah, which will 
    save him from eternal misery and doom. 

    If your friend really wants to know the truth, he has to be 
    honest with himself and free himself from whims and desires, especially in 
    such situations. 

    In the question itself there is the admission that his love 
    for that Christian girl is a sin. How can it be acceptable for a Muslim man 
    to love a woman in this way, when she is not his mahram and not his wife, 
    and it may be said to him, this woman represents the honour of another man. 
    Just as you would not accept for a non-mahram man to love your daughter or 
    your sister when he is not her husband, then others would not accept this 
    from you. 

    In such cases of love, the only thing that is permissible is 
    marriage based on the sound principles of sharee’ah, not just love which the 
    questioner himself accepts is a sin. When our pure monotheistic religion set 
    out regulations governing the relationships between men and women, it set 
    out a proper way for these relationships to be conducted. So marriage is the 
    beginning of these relationships not the result thereof. Marriage is not the 
    result of love which is a sin. Moreover, this system of relationships is in 
    the interests of the Muslim society, and its stability and soundness, 
    because going against the teachings of Islam leads to a great deal of 
    corruption and mischief, such as that mentioned in the question which causes 
    grief to the first wife. 

    One mistake leads to another, and another, and so on. This 
    young man – may Allaah bless him in this world and in the Hereafter – wants 
    to correct this sin by forsaking his first wife, but this is another sin 
    which is no less serious than the first one; a sin cannot be corrected by 
    means of another sin. 

    When Islam permits plural marriage, it stipulates the 
    condition of fair and just treatment for all the wives, so it obliges the 
    husband to treat all his wives fairly. Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “but if you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly 
    (with them), then only one or (slaves) that your right hands possess”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:3]

    Undoubtedly it is not just or fair to forsake the first wife 
    in order to marry the second, even if we assume that the intention in this 
    case is good, which is to make the Christian woman embrace Islam, for the 
    Islam of the second wife does not require that the first wife be mistreated. 
    The end does not justify the means. Moreover, there are many ways and means 
    of calling the Christian woman to Islam, all of which may be used. 

    How many people have been called to Islam without that 
    involving wrongdoing or committing of sin. 

    Based on the above, there can be no doubt that his first wife 
    will get angry; if he were in the same position he would get very angry 
    too. 

    Read with me the following hadeeth: “Whoever has two wives 
    and is more inclined towards one of them will come on the Day of 
    Resurrection with half of his body leaning.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1141; 
    al-Nasaa’i, 3942; Abu Dawood, 2133; it is saheeh according to Irwa’ 
    al-Ghaleel, 7/80, no. 2017) 

    Would you like to come on the Day of Resurrection with half 
    of your body leaning? Undoubtedly you would not like that. 

    All of the above applies if he wants to forsake his first 
    wife for a limited period of time. However, if he wants to forsake her 
    permanently, then it is even worse. I do not know which is meant in the 
    question. 

    Let us assume that you marry this woman after she becomes 
    Muslim, then you come to know of another woman who, if you marry her as a 
    third wife, that may be the reason for her becoming Muslim, but you do not 
    know her or love her. Will you forsake the second wife so that this one will 
    embrace Islam even though you do not love her? Answer yourself honestly. 

    Finally, I do not advise you to marry this Christian woman in 
    such circumstances where the matter is based on a previous sin, which is 
    loving her unlawfully. Yes, you are to be commended for your eagerness to 
    guide someone else to Islam. You could give her some Islamic books, 
    publications and tapes, and tell her about Islamic centers and female Muslim 
    daa’iyahs, or try to get her married to someone who is committed to Islam 
    and who could help her to remain steadfast, but without wronging a previous 
    wife, etc. 

    Secondly, it is obligatory to treat wives fairly with regard 
    to spending nights with them and spending on them. It is not permissible to 
    forsake the first wife unlawfully, even if that is with a noble intention. 

    Thirdly: The Muslim who is keen to keep his religious 
    commitment sound will keep away from love that is not based on a sound 
    foundation, even if that has a strong effect on the heart at first. Allaah 
    says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “As for those who strive hard in Us (Our Cause), We will 
    surely guide them to Our paths (i.e. Allaah’s religion — Islamic 
    Monotheism).”

    [al-‘Ankaboot 29:69]

    And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said: “There is nothing that you give up for the sake of Allaah, but 
    Allaah will compensate you with something that is better for you than it.” 
    (Narrated by Imam Ahmad, 20222; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani, 
    al-Silsilat al-Da’eefah, 5)

     You should strive to attain the mercy of Allaah and Paradise 
    by being kind towards the mother of your children and pleasing her as you 
    have angered her, and trying to make her happy after you have made her sad, 
    after she has lived with you for more than seven years.

When to make du`a in Istikharah prayer","Praise be to Allah.Istikharah prayer is a Sunnah which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prescribed for anyone who wants to do an action but is hesitant about it. 
What is Istikharah prayer?
Istikharah in Arabic means seeking guidance to make a decision concerning something. It is said in Arabic Istakhir Allaha yakhir laka (Seek guidance from Allah and He will guide you (to the right decision)).
In Shari`ah terminology, Istikharah means seeking guidance (to the right decision), i.e., seeking guidance as to what Allah knows is the best and most appropriate choice, by means of prayer or the du`a narrated concerning Istikharah. 
Is Istikharah sunnah?
The scholars unanimously agreed that Istikharah is Sunnah. The evidence that it is prescribed is the hadith narrated by al-Bukhari from Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: 
“The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to teach his Companions to make Istikharah in all matters, just as he used to teach them surahs from the Quran. He said: ‘If any one of you is deliberating about a decision he has to make, then let him pray two rak`ahs of non-obligatory prayer, then say: Allahumma inni astakhiruka bi ‘ilmika wa astaqdiruka bi qudratika wa as-aluka min fadlika al-'adhim , fa innaka taqdiru wa la aqdir, wa ta’lamu wa la a’lam, wa anta ‘allam al-ghuyub. Allahumma fa in kunta ta’lamu hadha’l-amra (then the matter should be mentioned by name) khayran li fi ‘ajil amri wa ajilihi (or: fi dini wa ma’ashi wa ‘aqibati amri) faqdurhu li wa yassirhu li thumma barik li fihi. Allahumma wa in kunta ta’lamu annahu sharrun li fi dini wa ma’ashi wa aaqibati amri (or: fi ‘ajili amri wa ajilihi) fasrifni ‘anhu [wasrifhu ‘anni] waqdur li al-khayr haythu kana thumma radini bihi (O Allah, I seek Your guidance [in making a choice] by virtue of Your knowledge, and I seek ability by virtue of Your power, and I ask You of Your great bounty. You have power, I have none. And You know, I know not. You are the Knower of hidden things. O Allah, if in Your knowledge, this matter (then it should be mentioned by name) is good for me both in this world and in the Hereafter (or: in my religion, my livelihood and my affairs), then ordain it for me, make it easy for me, and bless it for me. And if in Your knowledge it is bad for me and for my religion, my livelihood and my affairs (or: for me both in this world and the next), then turn me away from it, [and turn it away from me], and ordain for me the good wherever it may be and make me pleased with it).” (Narrated by al-Bukhari in several places in his Sahih (1166) 
Why we pray Istikharah 
The reason why Istikharah prayer is prescribed is that it is submission to the command of Allah and a practical demonstration that one has no power and no strength of one’s own. It means turning to Allah and seeking to combine the goodness of this world and of the Hereafter. In order to achieve that, one has to knock at the door of the King, Allah, may He be glorified, and there is nothing more beneficial in this regard than prayer and du`a, because they involve venerating Allah, praising Him and expressing one’s need for Him. Then after praying Istikharah one should do that which one feels is best. 
Cases where  Istikharah is recommended
In what circumstances should one pray Istikharah? The four Schools of Fiqh agreed that Istikharah is prescribed in cases where a person does not know the right decision to make .
In matters where it is known whether a thing is good or bad, such as acts of worship, doing good deeds, sins or evil actions, there is no need to pray Istikharah in these cases.
But if a person wants to find out the right time to do something, such as whether to do Hajj this year, because there is the possibility of encountering an enemy or some tribulation, or whether to go with a certain person or not, then he may pray Istikharah with regard to such decisions. But there is no room for Istikharah when it comes to things that are obligatory, haram or makruh. Rather Istikharah has to do with things that are recommended or permissible.
Istikharah is not ordinarily required with regard to things that are recommended, rather it should be done in cases where there is a conflict, i.e., when a person has a choice of two things and must decide which one to start with or which one not to do. With regard to permissible things, he may pray Istikharah as a regular matter. 
When should he start praying Istikharah?
The person who wants to pray Istikharah should have an open mind, and not have decided on a specific course of action. The phrase “If any one of you is deliberating” indicates that Istikharah should be prayed when one starts to think of the matter, when through the blessing of prayer and du`a what is good will become clear to him, in contrast to when the idea has taken root and his resolve to do it is firm, in which case his inclination will sway him, and there is the fear that wisdom may not prevail because he is inclined to do that which he has already decided to do. 
It may be that which is meant by deliberation here is resolve, because a passing thought does not matter. And a person should not pray Istikharah except when he has decided to do something but does not have a strong inclination towards it. Otherwise, if a person were to pray Istikharah for every thought that crosses his mind, he would never stop and he would waste all his time doing that. 
Consulting others before praying Istikharah
Al-Nawawi said: 
“It is mustahabb, before praying Istikharah, to consult someone whom you know is sincere, caring and has experience, and who is trustworthy with regard to his religious commitment and knowledge. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “and consult them in the affairs” [Al ‘Imran 3:159]”
What to recite in Istikharah prayer
There are three opinions as to what should be recited in Istikharah prayer: 

The Hanafis, Malikis and Shafi’is said that it is mustahabb, after reciting al-Fatihah, to recite Qul ya ayyuha’l-kafirun in the first rak`ah and Qul huwa Allahu ahad in the second.  Al-Nawawi said, explaining the reason for that: It is appropriate to recite these in prayer, to show sincerity and expressing your leaving your affairs to Allah. They said that it is also permissible to add other verses from Quran where the context refers to the idea of making a choice or decision.
Some of the Salaf said that in praying Istikharah it is good to add, after reciting al-Fatihah, the following verses in the first rak`ah:

“And your Lord creates whatsoever He wills and chooses, no choice have they (in any matter). Glorified is Allah, and exalted above all that they associate (as partners with Him).
And your Lord knows what their breasts conceal, and what they reveal.
And He is Allah; La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), all praises and thanks be to Him (both) in the first (i.e. in this world) and in the last (i.e. in the Hereafter). And for Him is the Decision, and to Him shall you (all) be returned.” [al-Qasas 28:68 – interpretation of the meaning]
And the following verse in the second rak`ah:
“It is not for a believer, man or woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decreed a matter that they should have any option in their decision. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, he has indeed strayed into a plain error.” [al-Ahzab 33:36 – interpretation of the meaning]

The Hanbalis and some of the fuqaha did not say that any particular verses are to be recited when praying Istikharah.

When to make du`a in Istikharah prayer
The Hanafis, Malikis, Shafi`is and Hanbalis stated that the du`a should be recited immediately after the prayer . This is in accordance with what was stated in the hadith narrated from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). (See al-Mawsu’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, part 3, p. 241) 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in al-Fatawa al-Kubra: Part 2, p. 265: 
“Question concerning Du`a al-Istikharah: should this du`a be recited during prayer or after saying the salam?  The answer is that it is permissible to recite the du`a of Istikharah before or after the salam, whether you are praying Istikharah prayer or another prayer. Reciting du`a before the salam is preferable, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to recite a lot of du`a before the salam, and the worshipper before saying the salam is still in a state of prayer, so it is better to recite the du`a then.”

11993,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11993,Can We Cut Nails at Night?,"Some people tell me that cutting nails at nighttime is not allowed, and also I've been taught that we have to spit and say Bismillah on the nail or hair 3 times before throwing it in the garbage,...so that Shaytan will not be able to take it or use it. Is this correct?","There is no basis for saying that cutting the nails at night is haram; rather a person may cut his nails whenever he wants, at any time of day or night. Also, there is no basis for saying that one must say Bismillah three times over nails or hair before throwing them away.",,"Praise be to Allah.There is no basis for saying that cutting the nails at night is haram; rather a person may cut his nails whenever he wants, at any time of day or night. 
Similarly, there is no basis for saying that one must say Bismillah three times over nails or hair before throwing them away, otherwise the Shaytan will use them. 
It is also not correct to say that they must be buried ; a hadith was narrated concerning that which is very weak.
It is permissible to throw them in the garbage or down the drain , or to bury them. If a person fears that they may fall into the hands of those who practice sihr (witchcraft) then he should dispose of them in a place where they will not be able to get hold of them.

11998,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/11998,Putting items that one wants to keep safe at the tombs of awliyaa’ (“saints”) so that they will guard them,"Some people put items which they want to keep safe at the graves of righteous people, thinking that they will guard them, so that they will not be stolen or take",,,"Praise be to Allah.Believing that the dead can guard items that are placed at their tombs is blatant kufr and shirk, associating others with Allaah in His Lordship (Ruboobiyyah). Whoever dies believing this deserves to spend eternity in Hell. Placing items that one wants to keep safe and other things at tombs to be guarded or to receive barakah (blessings) – all of these actions are not permitted at all. And Allaah knows best.
