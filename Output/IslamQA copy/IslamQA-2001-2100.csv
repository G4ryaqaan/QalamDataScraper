2001,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2001,Corruption of the Tawraat (Torah) and Injeel(Gospel),What sura in the Quran is related or mentions about the curruption of the Torah and Gospel?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Allah says about the Jews (interpretation of the meaning): “Do you (faithful believers) covet that they will belive in your religion in spite of the fact that a party of them (Jewish rabbis) used to hear the Word of Allah (the Tawraat), then they used to change it knowingly after they understood it?” [al-Baqarah 2:75]
Qutaadah said: “The phrase ‘then they used to change it knowingly after they understood it’ refers to the Jews, who used to hear the words of Allah, then they altered it after they had understood what it meant.”
Abu ‘Aaliyah said: “They took what Allah had revealed in their Book describing Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and changed its meaning.” Ibn Zayd said: “The phrase ‘[they] used to hear the Word of Allah (the Tawraat), then they used to change it’ refers to the Tawraat which Allah revealed to them; they changed it, making what it permitted forbidden, and what was forbidden allowed, changing the truth to falsehood and falsehood to truth…” [Tafseer Ibn Katheer]
Allah also said (interpretation of the meaning): “Among those who are Jews, there are some who displace words from (their) right places and say: ‘We hear your word (O Muhammad) and disobey,’ and ‘Hear and let you (Muhammad) hear nothing.’ And Raa’ina [in Arabic this means, ‘Be careful, listen to us and we listen to you,’ whereas in Hebrew it means ‘an insult.’] with a twist of their tongues and as a mockery of the religion (Islam). And if only they had said, ‘We hear and obey,’ and ‘Do make us understand,’ it would have been better for them, and more proper, but Allah has cursed them for their disbelief, so they believe not except for a few.” [al-Nisaa’ 4:46]
The phrase “[they] displace words from (their) right places” means that they misinterpret them and understand them in a way that Allah did not intend, doing this deliberately and inventing lies against Allah. [Tafseer Ibn Katheer]
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “So because of their breach of their covenant, We cursed them, and made their hearts grow hard. They change the words from their (right) places and have abandoned a good part of the Message that was sent to them. And you will not cease to discover deceit in them, except a few of them. But forgive them, and overlook (their misdeeds). Verily, Allah loves al-Muhsineen (good-doers).” [al-Maa’idah 5:13]
The phrase “because of their breach of their covenant, We cursed them” refers to the fact that they broke the Covenant which had been made with them, so Allah cursed them, i.e., He kept them away from following the True Guidance. “[We] made their hearts grow hard” means that they will not benefit from any preaching because their hearts are so hard. “They change the words from their (right) places” means that they play havoc with the words of Allah and misinterpret His Book, taking it to mean things that were never meant and attributing to Allah things that He never said; may Allah protect us from that.
“[They] have abandoned a good part of the Message that was sent to them” means that they stopped following its teachings because they did not want to follow them. Al-Hasan said: “They did not adhere to their religion or keep their duties towards Allah, without which no deeds are acceptable to Him; their fitrah (innate nature) was not sound and their deeds were not righteous.” [Tafseer Ibn Katheer]
So it becomes quite clear that the ways in which the Children of Israel tampered with the Tawraat and Injeel include the following:

Changing
Omitting
Adding things and attributing to Allah words that He did not say
Misinterpreting the words of Allah.

When Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was sent, the original Tawraat and Injeel had already been altered and distorted. Allah revealed the Qur’aan to His Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and guaranteed that He Himself would preserve it, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily We: it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e., the Qur’aan) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption).” [al-Hijr 15:9]
This distinguishing feature was not found in any Book before the Qur’aan. From the time of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) until the present (more than fourteen hundred years) the Qur’aan has stayed the same, and not a single letter of it has been changed, as ancient manuscripts and the hearts of generation after generation of people who have memorized the entire text and earned the title of “haafiz” bear witness. We ask Allah to guide us to the true and straight path.

2005,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2005,Can You Eat Fish Eyes?,I need to know whether we as Muslims are allowed to eat the eyes of a fish. I was eating at a seafood restaurant with a friend and I was enjoying the head of the fish and then I ate the eye and he was quite disgusted and said that it is not allowed in Islam. Is that true?,"Allah has permitted us all the produce of the sea. So, all parts of the fish are halal, including its skin, tail, eyes, etc.","Is seafood halal?


Can you eat fish eyes?


Disliking certain foods does not mean prohibiting them","Praise be to Allah.Is seafood halal?
Allah has permitted us all the produce of the sea . Hence we know that all parts of the fish are halal, including its skin, tail, eyes, etc.
{Lawful to you is (the pursuit of) water-game and its use for food} [al-Maidah 2:96 interpretation of the meaning]. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told us that it is halal (lawful) to eat dead creatures from the sea and dead fish , and no part of the fish was excluded from this permission. 
Can you eat fish eyes?
Hence we know that all parts of the fish are halal, including its skin, tail, eyes, etc.
It is strange indeed that a person could dare to forbid something that Allah has permitted. This is a very serious matter, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
{O you who believe! Make not unlawful the tayyibat (all that is good) which Allah has made lawful to you, and transgress not. Verily, Allah does not like the transgressors.} [al-Maidah 5:87]
{Say: Who has forbidden the adornment with clothes given by Allah, which He has produced for His slaves, and al-Tayyibat [all kinds of halal (lawful) things] of food? Say: They are, in the life of this world, for those who believe, (and) exclusively for them (believers) on the Day of Resurrection (the disbelievers will not share them). Thus We explain the ayat (Islamic law) in detail for people who have knowledge.} [al-A’raf 7:32]
{Say: Tell me, what provision Allah has sent down to you! And you have made of it lawful and unlawful. Say: has Allah permitted you (to do so), or do you invent a lie against Allah?} [Yunus 10:59]
Allah has also warned His slave against forbidding anything without knowledge. He said (interpretation of the meaning):
{And say not concerning that which your tongues put forth falsely: This is lawful and this is forbidden, so as to invent lies against Allah. Verily, those who invent lies against Allah will never prosper.} [al-Nahl 16:116]
This person who has invented a lie against Allah by saying that it is haram to eat the eye of a fish must repent to Allah, and not go beyond the limits in talking about the Religion of Allah. He should not speak without knowledge. Even if he is put off by something or feels disgusted by it, he has no right to say that it is haram. 
Disliking certain foods does not mean prohibiting them
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) hated the smell of garlic, and said: Whoever eats anything from this unpleasant plant should not approach us in the mosque. The people said, “It has become haram (forbidden), it has become haram.” When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) heard what was being said, he said: O people, it is not for me to forbid something that Allah has permitted; this is just a vegetable whose smell is unpleasant. (Reported by Ahmad and Muslim, 877)
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained that the fact that he disliked garlic and told people not to come to the mosque after eating it did not mean that it was haram.
Although the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) disliked the idea of eating lizard-meat, he did not forbid others to eat it, as is reported in the following story:
Khalid ibn al-Walid reported that some grilled lizard meat was brought to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and put in front of him. He stretched out his hand to take some, but one of the people present said, O Messenger of Allah, it is lizard meat, so he pulled his hand back. Khalid ibn al-Walid asked, O Messenger of Allah, is lizard haram? He said, No, but it is not known among my people and I cannot face eating it. So Khalid took some of the lizard meat and ate it, whilst the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) looked on. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 4981, al-Nasai, 4242, and Abu Dawud, 3300)
After explaining this answer to you, I want to warn you about something that I noticed in your question, where you said that you went to the seafood restaurant with a male friend. If this person is not your husband or a mahram (blood-relative whom you are permanently forbidden to marry), then you should fear Allah. Ask yourself: which is more serious, eating the eye of a fish or going out with a man to whom you are not related to sit and chat with him in a restaurant?
I ask Allah to protect us from all things that earn His wrath and to help us remember and fear Him. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.

2006,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2006,Can a Wife Refuse Intimacy?,"If a wife does not allow her husband to have intercourse, should he divorce her or should he marry a second wife?","The answer may be found in a hadith narrated by Muslim: “By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, there is no man who calls his wife to his bed and she refuses, but the One Who is above the heavens [i.e. Allah] will be angry with her, until he (her husband) is pleased with her.”",,"Praise be to Allah.If a woman refuses her husband’s request to come to bed with no Islamically-sound reason (such as sickness, or his being drunk, for example), what happens is as described below:
Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘If a man calls his wife to his bed and she refuses [and does not come], and he spends the night angry with her, the angels will curse her until morning.’” (Reported by al-Bukhari, 4794; the additional phrase quoted in square brackets is from Abu Dawud, al-Sunan, Kitab al-Nikaah, Bab haqq al-zawj ‘ala’l-mar-ah).
In the phrase “if a man calls his wife to his bed,” the word “bed” is obviously a metaphor for intercourse. Metaphors are used in the Quran and Sunnah to refer to things about which people usually feel shy.
Does this apply only to the nighttime, or does it include the daytime too? The answer may be found in a hadith narrated by Muslim: “By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, there is no man who calls his wife to his bed and she refuses, but the One Who is above the heavens [i.e. Allah] will be angry with her, until he (her husband) is pleased with her.” 
Ibn Khuzaymah and Ibn Hibban report a hadith narrated by Jabir: “There are three whose prayers will not be accepted and none of whose good deeds will ascend to heaven: a runaway slave, until he returns to his master; a drunken man until he becomes sober; and a woman with whom her husband is angry, until he is pleased with her.” These are general terms, which include both night and day.
The phrase “and he spends the night angry with her” refers to the cause of the angels’ curse, because this confirms that she is a sinner, which is a different matter than if he accepts her excuse and is not angry with her, or lets the matter drop. 
Is she to blame if he keeps her away from his bed? The answer is: no, unless she is the one who started the separation and he is keeping away from her because of it, and she did not apologize but prolonged the separation. But if he is the one who started it, and is thus treating her unfairly, then she is not to blame. In one report, instead of the words “the angels curse her until morning,” the wording is “… until she returns” – and this is a useful variant.
This hadith tells us that denying a spouse’s rights – whether physical or financial – is something that will inevitably bring about the wrath of Allah, unless Allah grants His mercy to the sinner.
We also learn that the angels will pray against a sinner so long as he or she persists in the sin.
The hadith also directs a wife to help her husband and seek his satisfaction, because a man is less patient than a woman when it comes to doing without intercourse. The most disturbing thing for a man is his sexual impulse, so Islam urges women to help their husbands in this regard. (Adapted and abbreviated from the commentary by al-Hafiz Ibn Hijr – may Allah have mercy on him – on this hadith in Fath al-Bari).
Whether the husband wants to discipline his wife, or forgive her, or take another wife, or divorce her, this is all up to him to choose. Let the woman beware of incurring her husband’s wrath because this will lead to Allah’s being angry with her.
We ask Allah to rectify this situation. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.

It is OK for you to marry a second wife, and in fact this could be the solution to your problem, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
""… then marry women of your choice, two or three, or four…"" [al-Nisaa’ 4:3]
- as long as you are going to treat them equally with regard to where you spend your nights and how much you spend on them. So if you spend one night with one, and the next night with the other, and spend on them equally, there is nothing wrong at all with marrying a second wife.

      recently came to Toronto, Canada, I was in riyadh for 13 years and I am giving islamic
      halaqas in my high school to Muslim students.  Boys to my left and girls to my right,
      the question is: Is this ikhtilat ?? Mixing between boys and girls??  I am the MSA
      leader and not quite sure of this issue ,,,, Salam",,,"Praise be to Allah.May Allaah reward you for your efforts in giving useful lessons to
    these Muslim students in your city, who are in the greatest need of learning about their
    religion in a land of kufr. Perhaps your background of having lived in Saudi Arabia will
    help you with this. I advise you to concentrate on teaching them about Tawheed and correct
    Islamic ‘aqeedah (belief), explaining how to do acts of worship from a Fiqh point of
    view, and teaching them the biographies of the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah
    be upon him) and his Companions.
As for the matter which you raised in your question, letting boys and
    girls sit together facing one another in one halaqah is not free from dangers, as you
    know. I think that you feel the same way, which is what made you ask this question,
    especially when we expect that the hijaab of the girls where you live is incomplete and
    that the faces of some of them, at least, are uncovered in front of the boys. For this
    reason I suggest one of two things: either get the girls to sit behind the boys, wearing
    full hijaab, so that you don’t feel embarrassed when you face the group to give a
    lesson; or put up a barrier or screen between the boys and girls, such that they can still
    hear your voice, if the girls do not want to wear full hijaab. Then they can ask questions
    from behind the screen, so long as they are not soft in speech, or they can write
    questions on pieces of paper.

    atheist does not differentiate between a Prophet and an astrologer","A disbeliever regards Prophet Muhammad
      (sal) as a great scholar, a great person but not approving him as the prophet of God.If we mentions the prophecy made by Muhammad (sal) and in the Quran, he
      compares it with the prophecy made by some other persons like Nostradamus. How to clarify
      him?",,,"Praise be to Allah.It seems that your friend, in his ignorance of the true nature 
  of Prophethood, does not make a distinction between a Prophet and an astrologer, 
  and so he compares the Prophethood of Muhammad  
  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the astrology of the French 
  physicist Nostradamus who lived in the 16th century CE and composed 
  books of fantasies and illusions. His books are written in ambiguous language 
  about events that will happen up until the end of the world, which he expected 
  would happen in the year 3797. A person like this needs to understand the true 
  nature of Prophethood and why mankind needs to believe in it, and he needs to 
  know that the Unseen can only be known through the Prophets who were chosen 
  by Allaah. He needs to know that Prophethood is a gift from Allaah, may He be 
  glorified, and it cannot be attained by a person’s desires or own efforts. 
  Prophethood is a pure blessing from Allaah, as is indicated in His words (interpretation 
  of the meanings):
“Those were they unto whom Allaah bestowed His Grace from 
  along the Prophets, of the offspring of Adam, and of those whom We carried (in 
  the ship) with Nooh…” [Maryam 19:58]
“Thus will your Lord choose you…” [Yoosuf 12:6]
“… I have chosen you above men by My Messages and by 
  My speaking (to you)…” [al-A’raaf 7:144]
“… Allaah knows best with whom to place His Message…” 
  [al-An’aam 6:124]
Then he should realize that the way in which Allaah conveys His 
  message to His Prophets and Messengers is by wahy (revelation). Allaah 
  says (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, We have inspired you 
  (O Muhammad) as We inspired Nooh and the Prophets after him…” [al-Nisa’ 
  4:163]. There is nothing wrong with explaining to him the three types or 
  levels of wahy so that he may have a better understanding of this channel of 
  communication between Allaah and His creation, which is so essential for mankind. 
  These three types or levels have been mentioned by Allaah in the Qur’aan 
  (interpretation of the meaning): “It is not given to any human being 
  that Allaah should speak to him unless (it be) by Inspiration, or from behind 
  a veil, or (that) He sends a Messenger to reveal what He wills by His leave. 
  Verily, He is Most High, Most Wise.” [al-Shooraa 42:51]
These three types or levels may be further explained as follows:

Inspiring something in the heart of a Prophet in such a way 
      that he has no doubt about it and is certain that it is from Allaah. It 
      was reported in a hadeeth that the Prophet  
      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The holy spirit 
      (i.e., Jibreel) blew into my heart that no soul dies until its provision 
      (rizq) and appointed time have expired, so fear Allaah and be polite 
      and reasonable when you seek to earn a living from others.” (Reported 
      by Ibn Hibbaan). This type of revelation also includes the visions of the 
      Prophets, which are true, as is proven in the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah 
      Umm al-Mu’mineen (may Allaah be pleased with her) who said: “The 
      first thing that happened to the Messenger of Allaah  
      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) of wahy was true vision in his 
      dreams: he did not see something but it would become as true as daybreak.” 
      (Agreed upon).

Therefore the Prophet and Friend of Allaah, Ibraaheem, hastened 
    to sacrifice his son when he saw that he was commanded to do so in a dream. 
    He took this dream as being a revelation to him, as Allaah tells us (interpretation 
    of the meaning): 
“So We gave him the glad tidings of a forbearing boy.
And, when he (his son) was old enough to walk with him, he 
    said, ‘O my son! I have seen in a dream that I am slaughtering you (offering 
    you in sacrifice to Allaah), so look what you think!’ He said: ‘O 
    my father! Do that which you are commanded, in sha Allaah (if Allaah will) 
    you will find me of al-saabireen (the patient ones).’
Then, when they had both submitted themselves (to the Will 
    of Allaah), and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead (or on the side 
    of his forehead, for slaughtering),
And We called out to him: ‘O Ibraaheem!
You have fulfilled the dream (vision)! Verily, thus do We reward 
    the muhsinoon (good-doers).
Verily, that was a manifest trial,
And We ransomed him with a great sacrifice (a ram).” [al-Saaffaat 
    37:101-107]
Speaking to His Messengers from behind a barrier. Allaah spoke 
      thus to Moosa, upon whom be peace, as He says (interpretation of the meanings): 
    
“And when Moosa came at the time and place appointed by 
    Us, and his Lord spoke to him…” [al-A’raaf 7:143]
“And when he came to it (the fire), he was called by name, 
    ‘O Moosa!
Verily, I am your Lord! So take off your shoes, you are in 
    the sacred valley, Tuwa.
And I have chosen you. So listen to that which is inspired to 
    you.
Verily, I am Allaah! None has the right to be worshipped but 
    I, so worship Me, and perform al-salaat (prayer) for My Remembrance.’”[Ta-Ha 
    20:12-14]
Revelation to a Prophet via an angel. This is what Allaah 
      refers to in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): “… 
      or He sends a Messenger to reveal what He wills by His leave…” 
      [al-Shoora 42:51]. This messenger is Jibreel, upon whom be peace.
The angel came to the Prophet in three forms as is proven 
      in the shar’i texts. These three forms are:

The Messenger  (peace and blessings 
        of Allaah be upon him) saw him in the form in which Allaah created him. 
        This happened to the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
        of Allaah be upon him) twice.


The revelation came with a noise like the sound of a bell, 
        which went away after the Prophet  (peace 
        and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had understood what he had said.


The angel appeared in the form of a man and spoke to him, 
        and the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
        be upon him) understood what he said. This was the easiest of the three 
        ways for the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
        of Allaah be upon him). This what happened the first time Jibreel came 
        to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
        be upon him) in the Cave of Hira’.

Then you should tell your friend something of the evidence 
  of the Prophethood of Muhammad  (peace and blessings 
  of Allaah be upon him) and his miracles (see Question # 2114), 
  the chief of which is the Qur’aan. There is no harm in giving him a copy 
  of the translation of its meanings. If he believes, then praise be to Allaah, 
  and if he remains a disbeliever after this, then he will bear the consequences 
  of his kufr and will be one of the losers, so do not worry about him, for Allaah 
  is independent of all creatures.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

      suitable Muslim partners, what questions can be asked, and what is forbidden to ask ?
     Can one ask about their past when they were
      non-Muslim or not practicing Muslims ?
  Can one ask ones wife/sister to describe in
      detail the appearance of an intended wife or describe in detail to them regarding a
      brother ?
     Was Salam",,,"Praise be to Allah.If you want to look for a wife for someone, or a husband for a woman, then
    you can ask him about his wishes, such as the desired age, level of education, employment
    situation, country and origin and position of the family, and whether he has any
    preferences about her general appearance, such as skin colour, height, etc. The most
    important characteristic to ask about is a person’s level of commitment to Islam.
    This kind of useful question is fine.
But asking for details of a person’s past and wanting to know what
    sins they might have committed when they were ignorant about Islam – this is not
    right at all. Allaah covers people’s sins and loves to see them covered (i.e., not
    dragged out into the open). So long as a person has repented, his sins have been wiped
    out. Islam deletes whatever came before, so why should we ask questions that will only
    embarrass people? Allaah accepts people’s repentance without their having to confess
    or expose their sins to any other person. A number of the Sahaabah had committed adultery
    and murder repeatedly, or had buried infant girls alive, or stolen things, but when they
    entered Islam they were the best of people. No one needs to be reminded of a shameful
    past; it is over and done with, and Allaah is the All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. What
    matters when considering a person for marriage is how that person is now: is he righteous
    or not? Has he cut all ties with his past and his wrong deeds, or not? If he is clearly
    living a good and righteous life now, then it is wrong to dig up the past. If there is any
    fear of anything that could have future implications, such as certain diseases and so on,
    then there are medical tests which can give the answer and put your mind at rest.
As far as giving a detailed description of a prospective wife to someone
    is concerned, this can be done in writing: one of her mahram relatives (i.e. a blood
    relative to whom marriage is permanently forbidden) or a woman who knows her can write
    down a description, then a trustworthy person can deliver it to one who is seriously
    considering a marriage proposal. The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
    him) said: “No woman should describe another woman to her husband as if he can see
    her.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 4839)
    The wisdom behind this prohibition is the fact that a
    husband might like the sound of what he hears, so he may divorce the one who described the
    other to him, or there may be temptation to do wrong. (Commentary on the above
    hadeeth in Fath al-Baari).

This is devastating because prohibiting something that has been made legal by Allah is similar to legalizing something He has prevented.",Sheikh Ibn Othaimeen

‘I do not know of any difference of opinion about the Sunnah that a woman should stand behind the man or men, if there is another man besides the imaam, or behind the imaam if she is alone. This is known from the hadeeth of Anas which was reported by al-Bukhaari, in which he said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) led him and his mother and maternal aunt in prayer: “He made me stand on his right, and made the woman stand behind us.” This was also reported by Maalik, according to whom he said: “I and the orphan stood behind him (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and the old woman stood behind us.”’
Elsewhere he said: ‘There is no difference of opinion regarding the fact that a woman on her own should pray behind the imaam, and that if there is another man present, he should stand beside the imaam and the woman should stand behind him.”

2036,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2036,What is the High Status of Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)?,I would like to know about the status of Prophet Muhammad peace and blessings be upon him,,,"Praise be to Allah.It is prescribed for everyone who hears the adhaan and call to prayer to repeat after the muezzin (caller to prayer), and when he has finished repeating the entire adhaan, he should send prayers and blessings on the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), then recite the words narrated in the saheeh hadeeth (authentic prophetic narration) from Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah, who reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever says when he hears the call to prayer, ‘Allahummah Rabba haadhihi’l-da’wat il-taammah wa’l-salaat il-qaa’imah, aati Muhammadan al-waseelata wa’l-fadeelah, wab’athhu maqaaman mahmoodan alladhi wa’adtahu (O Allah, Lord of this perfect Call and the Prayer to be offered, grant Muhammad the privilege and also the eminence, and resurrect him to the praised position that You have promised), will be granted my intercession on the Day of Resurrection.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 579). There is no phrase in this du’aa’ like “al-darajah al-‘aaliyah al-rafee’ah (the high and elevated status),” so this should not be said. The conjunction “wa” in the phrase “al-waseelata wa’l-fadeelah (the privilege and also the eminence) is by way of explanation; waseelah is the status higher than the rest of creation. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained it in the hadeeth narrated by ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas, who said that he heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “When you hear the muezzin and say something like he says, then send blessings on me, whoever sends blessings on me, Allah will send blessings tenfold on him. Then ask Allah to grant me al-waseelah, for it is a status in Paradise that only one of the slaves of Allah will reach, and I hope that I will be the one. Whoever asks for al-waseelah for me will be granted intercession.” (Reported by Muslim, 577).
The “praised position”(maqaam mahmood) is intercession before Allah so that He will start to judge between His slaves, and no one will be granted this except Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). This is mentioned in the words of Allah addressed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) (interpretation of the meaning):
“Perform al-salaah from mid-day till the darkness of the night (i.e., the Zuhr, ‘Asr, Maghrib and ‘Isha’ prayers), and recite the Qur’aan in the early dawn (i.e., the morning prayer). Verily, the recitation of the Qur’aan in the early dawn is ever witnessed (attended by the angels in charge of mankind of the day and the night).
And in some parts of the night (also) offer the salaah (prayer) with it (i.e., recite the Qur’aan in the prayer), as an additional prayer (tahajjud – optional prayer) for you (O Muhammad). It may be that your Lord will raise you to maqaaman mahmoodah (a station of praise and glory, i.e., the highest degree in Paradise).” [al-Isra’ 17:78-79]
It is called al-maqaam al-mahmood because all of creation will praise Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) for that status, because his intercession will ease their distress on that terrible day by setting the process of judgement in motion.

2037,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2037,Is Silk Haram for Men?,"I know that men should not wear silk garments, but if a garment is made of party silk but is not silky, soft, shiny, and feminine looking and looks like wool (suit coat), then would it be OK?",It is haram for Muslim men to wear pure silk but it is permissible for Muslim women to wear pure silk.,"Can men wear silk?


When can men wear silk?","Praise be to Allah.Can men wear silk?
The scholars agreed that it is permissible for women to wear and use pure silk , and that it is haram for men to do so. ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) took a piece of silk in his right hand and a piece of gold in his left, held them aloft and said: “These are haram for the males of my ummah and permitted for the females.” (Reported by Ibn Majah, 2/1189)
Abu Musa (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Gold and silk have been permitted for the females of my ummah and forbidden for the males.”
Indeed, a stern warning has been narrated concerning this matter, as was reported by al-Bukhari (5853) and Muslim (2069) in the hadith of Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both), who reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Silk is only worn in this world by the one who will have no share of the pleasure of the Hereafter.” 
Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever wears silk in this world will not wear it in the Hereafter.” (Reported by al-Bukhari, 5832)
When can men wear silk?
The scholars allowed men to wear silk in certain exceptional circumstances where there is Shar’i evidence to support this, such as Muslim combatants in war who are allowed to wear silk in order to show off and annoy the enemy, which is a kind of psychological warfare. 
People who are sick may also be permitted to wear silk to relieve their suffering, as Anas reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) allowed ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn ‘Awf and Ibn al-Zubayr (may Allah be pleased with them both) to wear silk because of a skin irritation that they suffered from. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 10/295, and Muslim, 3/1646)
The scholars also allowed men to wear garments containing four fingers’ width of silk, because of the hadith of ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade the wearing of silk except for an area the width of two fingers, or three or four.” (Reported by Muslim, 3/1644)
With regard to the matters mentioned in the question, the issue is not what a thing is called but what it really is. If the item that a man is going to wear is made of natural silk, then it is not permissible for him to wear it, no matter how it looks or feels, and no matter whether it is a shirt, pants, socks, a necktie or anything else.

2038,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2038,Mankind’s    need for Prophethood,what is the importance of prorhecy for the humanety? Why is faith in Prophethood so important?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Mankind is in need of Messengers and Prophets from Allah, to light the way and guide them to ways of peace, and to warn them against the ways of evil and corruption. Some of the things for which mankind clearly needs Messengers and Prophets are:

1 - Guidance to Allah, may He be exalted and glorified
Mankind has gone through periods where they did not have Messengers and Messages from Allah for a long time, and so they fell into the traps of illusions and myths, so they prayed to natural phenomena and heavenly bodies, or idols that could neither benefit nor harm them, worshipping them in fear and hope. At the same time, they were subjected to humiliation by those who claimed divinity, such as the Pharaohs and others. Even though there was never a time when at least a few people wondered about Who had sovereignty over the heavens and the earth and instinctively realized that there was a Creator, they still failed to worship Him properly and heed His commands and prohibitions and understand what He wanted them to do and not do, because they had no contact with anybody who could tell that about all that. The wisdom of Allah dictated that He should save the confused and misguided by blessing them with the knowledge of His Divine qualities and Beautiful Names, so He honoured them and all of humanity by sending Messengers who would guide them towards the Creator, as He tells us in the story of Nooh (peace be upon him): ""Indeed, We sent Nooh to his people and he said, 'O my people! Worship Allah! You have no other ilaah (god) but Him. Certainly, I fear for you the torment of a Great Day!'"" [Al-A'raaf 7:59]. All the Prophets and Messengers, peace and blessings of Allah be upon them, came one after the other, bringing the same Message.

2 - Guidance regarding the Hereafter
One of the reasons why Prophets and Messengers were sent was to tell people about the Hereafter, because if man does not believe in Allah and the Last Day, he will be a slave to his desires, running after material things and following the ways of misguidance. If he is reminded or advised, he will deny that he is answerable for his deeds. Allah has described such people in His words (interpretation of the meaning): ""And they say, 'There is nothing but our life of this world, we die and we live and nothing destroys us except al-dahr (the time).' And they have no knowledge of it, they only conjecture."" [Al-Jaathiyah 45:24].

So it was the task of the Prophets and Messengers to establish proof of the Last Day, and to explain that the One Who created mankind from nothing is able to bring them back to life after their death, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""Say: 'Allah gives you life, then causes you to die, then He will assemble you on the Day of Resurrection about which there is no doubt. But most of mankind know not."" [al-Jaathiyah 45:26]. On that Day, the scales of justice will be set up and scores between oppressors and their victims will be settled. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""And We shall set up balances of justice on the Day of Resurrection, then none will be dealt with unjustly in anything. And if there be the weight of a mustard seed, We will bring it. And Sufficient are We as Reckoners."" [Al-Anbiya' 21:47]. If it were not for this Reckoning, which we know about only through Prophethood, life would be pointless and a means only for wrongdoing - and this is contrary to the wisdom of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.

3 - Meeting man's need for religion
So long as man remains sound of nature, clear of mind and pure of heart, his need for religion remains a part of him, and he understands that there has to be an Almighty Creator who created and organized the universe in the best way. Thus there emerges from the depths of his being the urge to submit himself fully to the Creator, to seek His help at times of calamity and distress, and to humble himself before Him, as he feels his great need for Him both at times of ease and of hardship. This is referred to in the Qur'aan (interpretation of the meaning): ""So set your face towards the religion of pure Islamic monotheism haneefa (worship none but Allah Alone), Allah's fitrah (pattern) with which He has created mankind. No change let there be in khalq-illah [i.e., the Religion of Allah], that is the straight religion, but most of men know not."" [Al-Room 30:30]

According to a hadeeth narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), ""Every new-born baby is born according to the fitrah, then his parents make him into a Jew or a Christian or a Magian (Zoroastrian)"" (Agreed upon). How could a man know how to become religious and worship his Creator without Revelation from Allah to tell him about it? There has to be a mediator between Allah and His creation so that mankind can know about the religion which the Creator wants them to follow; this is the role of the Prophets.

4 - Guidance regarding proper ways of dealing with one another
It is well known that man is by nature sociable, and that he has wishes and desires that cannot be achieved except in cooperation with his fellow-man. So it is clear that mankind urgently needs guidance to regulate his relationships with others, to outline the right way of behaving, to resolve disputes and conflicts, to guard against wrong-doing and oppression, and to protect people's rights - lest some people oppress others. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ""Indeed We have sent Our Messengers with clear proofs, and revealed with them the Scriptures and the Balance (justice) that mankind may keep up justice"" [Al-Hadeed 57:24].

5 - Guidance towards sound morals
It is also a part of man's nature that he will strive to fulfil his needs even if he does so by means of oppression and domination. So he urgently needs a deterrent, in the form of belief in Allah and the Last Day, to motivate him to acquire good qualities and praiseworthy morals. These can only be known through the divine laws brought and conveyed by the Prophets and Messengers of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon them.

6 - Achieving justice in accordance with the will of Allah
It is well known that Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, is Fair and Just. He rewards the one who does good as a blessing and favour from Him, and He punishes the one who does wrong as an act of justice on His part.

Allah, by His wisdom and mercy, sent His Messengers, from Aadam to Muhammad (may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon them all) to establish proof (so that people would have no excuse). Allah says (interpretation of the meanings):
""And if We had destroyed them with a torment before this (i.e., Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the Qur'aan), they would surely have said, 'Our Lord! If only You had sent us a Messenger, we should certainly have followed Your aayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), before we were humiliated and disgraced.'"" [Ta-Ha 20:134]
""Messengers as bearers of good news as well as of warning in order that mankind should have no plea against Allah after the Messengers"" [Al-Nisa' 4:165]

Allah, Who is the Most Just of judges, has decreed that He will not punish a nation until He has sent a Messenger to them, as He says: ""Whoever goes right, then he goes right only for the benefit of his own self. And whoever goes astray, then he goes astray to his own loss. No one laden with burdens can bear another's burden. And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger (to give warning)."" [Al-Isra' 17:15]

The above should explain the extent of mankind's need for Messengers and their Messages, and why their happiness in this world and the next is connected to that.

2039,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2039,Regarding the number 13 as unlucky,"There are some Muslims that claim certain numbers have a special meaning. Some people including unbelievers and Muslims say that the number 13 is a bad or evil number, and some Muslims have found reasons to believe this too. One Muslim said that the Jews captured Jerusalem from Muslims on Friday the 13 and the general who captured it used 13 armies, thus the number is cursed. Is all this just superstition and omen searching which has no place in Islam?",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permitted for the Muslim who believes in Allah as his Lord, Islam as his religion, Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) as a Prophet and Messenger, and in the divine decree, both good and bad, to think that any being, entity or quality can have a specific effect in bringing good or warding off harm, as there is no evidence in shareeah to that effect. This is part of the legacy of jaahiliyyah (ignorance) which has been cancelled out by Islam and is regarded as being shirk which negates perfect Tawheed, because it is insinuating thoughts (waswaas) and scare tactics from the Shaytaan.
It is like the attitude of the people of Pharaoh, about whom Allah said (interpretation of the meaning): But whenever good came to them, they said, Ours is this. And if evil afflicted them, they ascribed it to evil omens connected with Moosa and those with him [al-Araaf 7:131]. If some disaster or drought befell them, they blamed it on evil omens which they associated with Moosa and the believers with him, but Allah refuted this and said (interpretation of the meaning): Verily, their evil omens are with Allah [al-Araaf 7:131].
Ibn Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: Their evil omens means what He decreed for them; they were the cause of what happened to them because of their kufr and rejection of the signs and messengers of Allah.
Many ahaadeeth were reported from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in which he forbade pessimism and superstitious belief in evil omens. The word tatayyur (pessimism) is derived from teer (birds), because some birds were viewed as evil omens, then the word came to be applied to everything that is taken as a bad sign. Abu Hurayrah reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, No adwaa
[transmission of infectious diease without the permission of Allah], no tiyarah [superstitious belief in bird omens], no haamah [refers to a Jaahili Arab tradition described variously as: a worm that infests the grave of a murder victim until he is avenged; an owl; or the bones of a dead person turned into a bird that could fly], and no Safar [the month of Safar was regarded as unlucky in the Jaahiliyyah]. [Translators notes in square brackets]. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 5757, and Muslim, 2220.] Muslim added in one of his reports: And no naw (star promising rain) and no ghool (evil demon living in the desert).
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) denounced adwaa, the Jaahili belief that attributed sickness to something other than Allah and said that the sickness could transmit itself without the decree of Allah. He explained that all of that happens by the decree of Allah, and that people are instructed to avoid the causes of disaster if they are in good health.
The words no Safar, according to one of the interpretations given by the scholars, refer to the month of Safar, which the people of the Jaahiliyyah viewed with pessimism as being unlucky, as was reported in Sunan Abi Dawood (3914) from Muhammad ibn Raashid from someone who heard him say: The people of the Jaahiliyyah used to regard Safar as inauspicious, and said that it was an unlucky month. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) refuted that.
Imaam Ibn Rajab (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Regarding Safar as inauspicious is a kind of superstition that is forbidden. Also forbidden is regarding particular days, such as Wednesdays, as inauspicious, or following the Jaahili custom of regarding Shawwaal as inauspicious for weddings.
No doubt this also includes the superstitions about the number 13 mentioned in the question. There is no indication in the Quraan or Sunnah that this number should be regarded as inauspicious in any way. The thirteenth is just an ordinary day, like any other day, and anything that happens on such a day happens by divine decree; Allah decreed that it should happen on that day in that way. If a person tried to spend his time counting the numbers of days or dates on which calamities befell the Muslim ummah, he might find some patterns in some instances, but this has nothing to do with bad luck because of certain numbers or dates on which those events happened.
The remedy for this kind of waswaas is for a person to strengthen his heart, have certain faith (yaqeen) in Allah and put his trust in Him. He should know that no disaster happens except by the decree of Allah, and he should beware of getting carried away with this waswaas from the Shaytaan or these ideas that may cross his mind. He may be punished with the very thing that he is fearing, because he is turning away from having faith in Allah and the belief that all good is in His hands, and that He Alone is the one who wards off harm by His power and grace.
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught us the kafaarah (expiation) to be offered by the one who indulges in any kind of superstitious pessimism. Abd-Allah ibn Amr reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Whoever lets tiyarah (superstition) stop him from doing something is guilty of shirk. They said, What is the kafaarah (expiation) for that? He said, To say: Allahumma la khayra illaa khayruka wa laa tayra illaa tayruka wa laa ilaaha ghayruka (O Allah, there is no good except Your good, no birds except Yours, and there is no god beside You). And Allah knows best.
As this issue is widespread among people nowadays, there is no harm in going into further detail, as follows:
In the Name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful
Tiyarah and Fal (Bad omens and good omens)
[1] Tiyarah (seeing bad omens) comes from the word tayr (birds) [because the ancient Arabs used to see omens in the movements of birds and other creatures Translator], and is the opposite of fal (good omens). The Arabs all used to have the same ideas about fal and tiyarah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) approved of and encouraged the idea of seeing good omens, but he disapproved and forbade the idea of seeing bad omens.
[2] Al-Izz ibn Abd al-Salaam said: The difference between al-tiyarah and al-tatayyur is that tatayyur means feeling in one's heart that something bad is going to happen, whilst tiyarah means acting on the basis of those pessimistic feelings.
[3] Tiyarah existed long before Islam. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): But whenever good came to them, they said, Ours is this. And if evil afflicted them, they ascribed it to evil omens connected with Moosa and those with him [al-Araaf 7:131].
[4] Types of superstitious belief in bad omens, ancient and modern:




Certain days or months, such as Safar and Shawwaal.


Certain birds, such as crows and owls.


Certain animals, such as snakes, black cats and monkeys, or their movements, such as the passing of gazelles.


Certain types of people, such as a one-eyed man or a hunchback.


Certain numbers, such as 13 among the Christians, 7 among the Bedouin and 10 among the Raafidis; in the latter case because they dislike the asharah mubashsharah (the ten Sahaabah who were given the certain promise of Paradise) with the exception of Ali (may Allah be pleased with him). Hence they will say Nine plus one instead of ten.


Certain sounds, such as the voice of a crow or the sound of an ambulance or fire truck.


Frightening or disturbing dreams.


Colours, such as the colour of blood, or yellow.


When the eyelashes of the left eye tremble involuntarily, they say, Something bad is going to happen to us.


Calling a child by the name of a living person, such as the father or mother and so on.


Witnessing an accident or a fire in the morning.


Seeing ones wifes mother in the morning.


When the right hand or right foot itches.




[5] The virtue of tawakkul (putting ones trust in Allah) and not indulging in tiyarah. The Prophet ( peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Seventy thousand people will enter Paradise without being called to account and without being punished. Among the virtues of these people, he described them as not believing in tiyarah and as putting their trust in Allah. (Reported by Muslim).
[6] Condemnation of tiyarah and explanation that it is a kind of shirk. Ibn Masood (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Al-tiyarah is shirk, and he said it three times. (Reported by Abu Dawood and others, and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani).
Imraan ibn Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: He is not one of us who does tiyarah or has it done for himself Al-Albaani said: Its isnaad is hasan. Ibn al-Qayyim said: Tiyarah is a kind of shirk and a way in which the Shaytaan influences and scares a person. It is very serious for the one who takes it to heart and pays too much attention to it, but it is insignificant for the one who pays no attention to it and is not concerned about it.
[7] Negation of tiyarah and superstition. Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: There is no adwaa (contagion) or tiyarah, but I like righteous fal.
(Muslim). And he said, No adwaa, no tiyarah, no haamah, and no Safar. (Reported by al-Bukhaari and Muslim).
Muaawiyah ibn al-Hakam al-Salami reported that he said to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): Some of us believe in tiyarah. He said, That is something that any of you may feel in himself, but it should not stop you from doing anything.
(Muslim).
So the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained that any anxiety suffered because of tiyarah is all in the mind and has nothing to do with the object that caused the fear. It is the persons own illusion, fear and shirk that is affecting him and stopping him from doing what he wants to do, not the thing that he saw or heard. Whoever adheres firmly to the bonds of Tawheed and puts all his trust in Allah, thus nipping the ideas of tiyarah in the bud before they take hold, will be successful and happy in this world and the next.
In a saheeh hadeeth, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Leave any ideas of tiyarah as they are [i.e., do not take them any further].
(Saheeh Abi Dawood). What this hadeeth means is that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wanted them not to pay attention to such ideas, but to leave them alone, as Allah had made them, because they can bring neither benefit nor harm.
Ibn Jareer said: What this means is to leave birds (tayr) alone without shooing them away, and carry on with one's own business, because shooing them away does not bring any benefit or ward off any harm.
Ikrimah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: We were sitting with Ibn Abbaas when a bird flew over us and screeched. A man who was there said, Good! Ibn Abbaas said to him, It is neither good nor bad. He hastened to rebuke him lest he think that it had any influence for good or evil.
Taawoos set out on a journey with one of his friends, and a crow screeched. The man said, Good! Taawoos said, What is the good in that? Do not accompany me any further.
Ibn Abd al-Hakam said: Muzaahim said, When Umar ibn Abd al-Azeez set out from Madeenah, I looked and saw that the moon was in Hyades [a group of stars in Taurus], and I did not want to tell him that, so I just said to him, Look how beautiful the moon looks tonight. Umar looked, and saw that the moon was in Hyades, and said, It is as if you wanted to tell me that the moon was in Hyades. O Muzaahim, we do not go out by the help of the sun or the moon; we go out by the help of Allah, al-Waahid, al-Qahhaar.
[8] The limits of tiyarah. The kind of tiyarah that makes a person go ahead with his plans or stops him from going ahead is the kind of tiyarah that is prohibited. As for the good omens (fal) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) liked, this is a kind of optimism that a person does not feel dependent upon, unlike things that may make a person either go ahead or change his plans, in which a person is in a sense depending upon it. And Allah knows best.
[9] Kafaarah (expiation) for one who engages in tiyarah. Imaam Ahmad reported in his Musnad and Ibn al-Sunni also reported with a saheeh isnaad from Abd-Allah ibn Amr that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Whoever lets tiyarah stop him from doing something is guilty of shirk. They said, What is the kafaarah for that? He said, To say: Allahumma la khayra illaa khayruka wa laa tayra illaa tayruka wa laa ilaaha ghayruka (O Allah, there is no good except Your good, no birds except Yours, and there is no god beside You).
no birds except Yours means: the birds are part of Your creation, they can bring neither benefit nor harm, and the only One Who can bring benefit or harm is You, may You be glorified.
[10] Remedies for tatayyur:
(a) tawakkul, which means delegating all ones affairs to Allah and relying on Him, whilst at the same time taking the necessary means and precautions. This is an obligation which must be done purely and sincerely for Allah, because it is one of the best forms of worship and highest levels of Tawheed. Allah says (interpretation of the meanings): and put your trust in Allah, if you are believers indeed. [al-Maaidah 5:23] and And put yout trust in the Ever-Living One Who dies not, and glorify His Praises, and Sufficient is He as the All-Knower of the sins of His slaves. [al-Furqaan 25:58]. Putting ones trust in Allah is one of the greatest and most important ways of getting rid of pessimism and superstition and other matters pertaining to shirk.
(b) Knowing that everything that happens, happens by the decree of Allah. Blessings and calamities alike are covered by the will and decree of Allah, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): No calamity befalls on the earth or in yourselves but is inscribed in the Book of Decrees (al-lawh al-mahfooz), before We bring it into existence. Verily, that is easy for Allah. [al-Hadeed 57:22]. Thus a person may be reassured about these matters, and there is no need for tatayyur or tiyarah, because good and bad alike are subject to the will and decree of Allah.
(c)   Istikhaarah. This is one of the greatest forms of worship and is complete tawakkul or dependence on Allah. It is the alternative to tatayyur and tiyarah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to teach his Companions to make istikhaarah for all their affairs just as he used to teach them the soorahs of the Quraan.
(d)   Moving away from places which one thinks are unlucky. Here we are talking about doubt, not certainty. Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: A man said, O Messenger of Allah, we lived in a house where our number was great and our wealth was abundant, then we moved to a house where our numbers dwindled and our wealth decreased. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Leave it, for it is bad. (Reported by Maalik, Abu Dawood, al-Bukhaari in al-Adab al-Mufrad, and classed as hasan by al-Albaani).
Leave it, for it is bad Ibn Abd al-Barr said: I think that he said it lest they adhere to thoughts of tiyarah. Al-Baghawi said: He told them to move away from it because they did not like it and did not feel comfortable; if they moved, the things they were feeling would go away. He did not tell them to move because the house was the cause of the problems.
But the Creator made that the time for His decree to be carried out. suggested by Ibn al-Arabi al-Maaliki.
(e)   Fal (good omen). This is the opposite of tiyarah, for example when a man who is sick hears another addressing him as Ya saalim (O healthy one)!. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: There is no adwaa (contagion) and no tiyarah, but I like righteous fal, a good word. (Reported by al-Bukhaari and Muslim).
The difference between fal and tiyarah is that fal involves thinking in positive terms about Allah, whereas tiyarah involves the opposite, so for this reason it is disliked.
There is another issue here: if a person puts his trust in Allah and goes ahead with his plans, then disaster strikes and harm befalls him, how can this happen when he thought of Allah in positive terms? Our answer is that this is a test, not an omen or tiyarah; the believer is tested in accordance with the level of his faith.
Haafiz al-Hakami said: One of the conditions of fal is that it is not something that a person relies on or tries to figure out; it is just a coincidence that happens to a person without him thinking about it. It is a particularly loathsome form of bidah to try to find fal in the Quraan [by opening it at random]. The one who takes the Verses of Allah as a joke or idle entertainment is surely doing wrong. If a person tries to figure out fal and use it to get good luck, this is tiyarah, like using arrows to seek luck or a decision.
O Allah, we seek refuge with You from associating anything knowingly with You, and we seek Your forgiveness for that which we do unknowingly.

Whatever the case, the fact that these feelings of distress and the dislike of polygamy exist does not justify condemnation of polygamy. Islam came to serve and increase people’s best interests, and to reduce harmful things and render them ineffective. There is no doubt that polygamy, when practised properly in accordance with Islam, achieves many things that are in people’s best interests (such as maintaining the chastity of the man who is not satisfied with one wife, taking care of and maintaining the chastity of the woman who has no husband, increasing the offspring of the Muslims, solving the problem of widows and spinsters, and of the reduced numbers of men after times of war, and so on). As regards the bad things that happen in cases of polygamy, either they are very small when compared to its benefits, or they stem from bad application of this practice. One of the rights which Islam gives to women is that a wife should have her own house, so the two wives do not have to live together under one roof.

The ways in which one can show them kindness and respect are many, e.g., visiting them, speaking kindly to them, lowering to them the wing of humility, giving them gifts, and so on. When you go to visit them with the hope of earning reward from Allah, this is a great form of worship. A son should not neglect this type of worship, and he should appreciate the joy that his parents feel when they see their son and spend time with him. He should not let his work keep him away from seeing his parents, because it is very important and precious for them to see their son. If a person is aware of some negative things when he visits them, he can reduce these negative aspects, or cut the visit short and make up for it in other ways, such as sending letters, making telephone calls or others ways of keeping in touch and maintaining ties, like giving gifts, and so on.

2063,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2063,Is Sleeping after Fajr Haram?,I would like to know if there is any verdict concerning sleeping after Fajr prayer.,"There is no text in the Quran or the Sunnah to indicate that sleeping after praying Fajr is prohibited. So the general principle applies (i.e., everything is permitted except that which has been expressly forbidden).","Is sleeping after Fajr haram?


Is sleeping after ‘Asr makruh?","Praise be to Allah.Is sleeping after Fajr haram?
As far as a person’s sleeping after praying Fajr is concerned, no text (of Quran or hadith) has been reported to indicate that this is prohibited, so the general principle applies (i.e., everything is permitted except that which has been expressly forbidden).
But the practice of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his Companions after praying Fajr was to remain sitting in the place where they had prayed until the sun rose, as is reported in  Sahih Muslim (1/463) in the hadith of Sammak ibn Harb, who said: “I asked Jabir ibn Samurah, ‘Did you used to sit with the Messenger of Allah?’ He said, ‘Yes, frequently. He would not get up from the place where he had prayed Subh until the sun rose. When the sun rose, he would get up. They used to talk about things that had happened during the Jahiliyyah, and they would laugh and smile.’”
Also, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked his Lord to bless his ummah in the mornings, as is reported in the hadith of Sakhr al-Ghamidi, who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “O Allah, bless my ummah in the mornings.’ Whenever he sent out troops or an army, he would send them at the beginning of the day.’” Sakhr was a trader, and he used to send out his caravans at the beginning of the day, and he did well as a result and made money.” (Reported by Abu Dawud, al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah, with an isnad in which there is some jahalah (i.e., one narrator is unknown); corroborating evidence is to be found in a hadith narrated by ‘Ali, Ibn ‘Umar, Ibn 'Abbas, Ibn Mas’ud and others, may Allah be pleased with them all.)
For this reason some of the salaf disliked the idea of sleeping after Fajr. Ibn Abi Shaybah reported in his
Musannaf (5/222, no. 25442) with a sahih isnad from ‘Urwah ibn al-Zubayr that he said: “Al-Zubayr used to forbid his children to sleep in the morning.” ‘Urwah said: “I do not hear of any man who sleeps in the morning, but I lose interest in that person.”
In summary then, people should make the most of this time which can bring many benefits in this world and in the Hereafter, but if a person sleeps at this time to gain strength to do his work, there is nothing wrong with this, especially if it is not easy for him to sleep at any other time of the day.
Ibn Abi Shaybah reported in his Musannaf (5/223, no. 25454) from the hadith of Abu Yazid al-Madini who said: “Umar came to Suhayb one morning and found him sleeping, so he sat down until he woke up. Suhayb said: ‘The Amir al-Muminin is sitting in his place and Suhayb is sleeping!’ ‘Umar said to him: ‘I did not like to disturb your sleep that could be beneficial for you.’”
Is sleeping after ‘Asr makruh?
As for sleeping after ‘Asr , this is also permitted; there is no sahih hadith from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to indicate that sleeping at this time is prohibited.
As for the words, “Whoever sleeps after ‘Asr and loses his mind as a result has no-one to blame but himself,” which are attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), this is a false hadith and there is no proof that these words were uttered by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).

Undoubtedly issuing fatwas without being qualified to do so is a grave sin, and means that one is speaking without knowledge.

As Salaamu Alaikum",,,"Praise be to Allah.It should be noted that one of the main reasons that cause problems between spouses, and that could cause these problems to escalate to a very bad level is a lack of knowledge of the rights which each partner has over the other.
Islam states these rights clearly, and urges and obliges each partner to fulfil them, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): And they (women) have rights (over their husbands) similar (to those of their husbands) over them, but men have a degree (of responsibility) over them [al-Baqarah 2:228]. This aayah indicates that for every right that one partner has, there is a corresponding duty which the other partner must fulfil; thus balance will be achieved in all aspects of the relationship, which will strengthen the stability of family life. Ibn Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with them both) said concerning this aayah: It is their (womens) right to good companionship and proper treatment on the part of their husbands, and their duty to obey and do what their husbands tell them to do. Ibn Zayd said: Fear Allaah with regard to them (wives) just as they should fear Allaah with regard to you. Al-Qurtubi said: This aayah covers all the rights and duties within marriage.
One of those rights is that trivial mistakes should be overlooked, especially words and deeds by which no harm was intended. Anas ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Every son of Adam makes mistakes, and the best of those who make mistakes are those who repent.
(Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 2501; Saheeh al-Jaami, 4/171).
Both husband and wife have to be patient and put up with one another, because everyone makes mistakes, and the one with whom you have to be most patient is the one with whom you live and interacts with most. Neither party should resort to tit-for-tat reactions. If one spouse sees that the other is very angry, he or she should restrain his or her own anger, and not respond immediately. For this reason Abul-Darda said to his wife: If you see me angry, calm me down, and if I see you angry, I will calm you down, otherwise it will be too difficult to live together. The imaam of Ahl al-Sunnah, Imaam Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on him) married Abbaasah
bint al-Mufaddal, the mother of his son Saalih, and he used to say of her: Umm Saalih lived with me for twenty years, and we never argued over the slightest thing.
One of the most important rights/duties is that each spouse should advise and remind the other to obey Allaah. It is reported in a saheeh hadeeth that a group of the Sahaabah asked the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): Teach us which kind of wealth is best, so that we may try to acquire it? He said: The best is a remembering tongue (one that remembers Allaah), a grateful heart and a believing wife who helps ones faith.
(Reported by Ahmad, 5/278; al-Tirmidhi, 3039; Saheeh al-Jaami, 5231).
A man should not make his wife angry if he sees in her something that he dislikes, because if he dislikes one of her characteristics, he will like another, so he should balance the two. The Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: No believing man should hate a believing woman: if he dislikes one of her characteristics, he will like another.
(Reported by Muslim, 36). Samurah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Woman was created from a rib, and if you try to straighten a rib you will break it, so deal with her gently. (Reported by Ahmad, 5/8; Ibn Hibbaan, 1308; Saheeh al-Jaami, 2/163).
One of the best ways to ensure a good atmosphere between husband and wife is a good attitude, hence Islam placed an important emphasis on this matter. The Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was the ultimate in good treatment of others and good attitude. Abul-Darda reported that the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: There is no good deed that will be put in the balance that will weight heavier than a good attitude. The one who has a good attitude will reach, because of it, the level of those who fast and pray.
(Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 2003; Abu Dawood, 4799). Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The most perfect of the believers in faith are the best in attitude, and the best of you are those who are best to their womenfolk. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 1/217; Ahmad, 2/250; Al-Silsilat al-Saheehah, 284).
Some of the ways in which one can treat ones wife well are to turn a blind eye and not to pick on things, great or small, and not to rebuke or scold for every single incident, except in the case of duties towards Allaah. This is how Allaah guides us in the Quraan, when He says (interpretation of the meaning): and live with them (women) honourably. If you dislike them, it may be that you dislike a thing and Allaah brings through it a great deal of good. [al-Nisa 4:19]. If a woman disobeys her husband and refuses to obey him, he has the right to discipline her as prescribed by shareeah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allaah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they (spend) to support them) from their means. Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient (to Allaah and their husbands) and guard in the husbands absence what Allaah orders them to guard (e.g., their chastity, their husbands property, etc.). As to those women on whose part you see ill-conduct, admonish them (first), (next) refuse to share their beds, (and last) beat them (lightly, if it is useful), but if they return to obedience, seek not against them means (of annoyance). Surely, Allaah is Ever Most High, Most Great. [al-Nisa 4:34]. This aayah indicates that the husband has the right to discipline his wife when she disobeys his orders or rebels against him, and that this discipline takes a step-by-step approach which may reach the level of hitting, within certain conditions. Al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Know that Allaah does not command hitting in His Book in clear terms except in this passage and with regard to the prescribed punishments (hudood), so disobedience to husbands is equated with major sins, and Allaah has given the task (of disciplining) to husbands, instead of leaders, and without the need for judges, witnesses or evidence, because Allaah has entrusted wives to their husbands.
Ill-conduct (nushooz) here refers to disobedience, i.e., those on whose part you fear disobedience and rejection of Allaahs command to obey their husbands. Allaah has made this discipline in stages, as follows:


Admonition without forsaking them (refusing to share their beds) or hitting them. So the woman is reminded of her duty to be a good companion and treat her husband properly. If gentle admonition and kindly reminders do not work, then the discipline is taken to the second stage:


Forsaking, by turning his back on her in bed or sleeping in a separate bed. But he should not go to extremes in this by keeping away for more than four months, which is the period set by Allaah for the one that swears not to approach his wife. This forsaking should only be for the purposes of disciplining and correcting, not for taking revenge or punishing.


Hitting in a manner that is not painful, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): beat them (lightly, if it is useful),. Ibn Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: Forsake her in her bed, and if she mends her ways (this is good), but if not, then Allaah has given permission for you to hit her in a way that is not painful. The husband must be careful to ensure that his hitting is for the purpose of discipline and warning, and not for any other purpose, so he must make sure that he hits as lightly as possible, by prodding with the fist and so on. Ata said: I said to Ibn Abbaas: What is the hitting that is not painful? He said, The siwaak (tooth-stick) and so on. (i.e., hitting with the siwaak).


The Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, advising his ummah: Fear Allaah with regard to women, for you have taken them as a trust from Allaah and they are lawful to you by the word of Allaah. Your rights over them are that they should not allow anyone to sit on your beds whom you dislike, so if they do that then hit them in a way that is not painful.
(Saheeh hadeeth). The husband should avoid hitting parts of the body that are sensitive, such as the head and stomach, and the face, because the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade hitting the face in general. Muaawiyah ibn Haydah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: I said, O Messenger of Allaah, what are the rights of the wife of any one of us over us? He said, That you feed her as you feed yourself and clothe her as you clothe yourself, and that you do not say May Allaah make your face ugly or hit her i.e., in the face. (Reported by Abu Dawood, 2/244; Ibn Maajah, 1850; Ahmad, 4/446).
If she desists, and stops rebelling, then he is not allowed to keep punishing her or to accuse her of saying or doing anything, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): but if they return to obedience, seek not against them means (of annoyance).
With regard to your particular situation, we do not know all the details or the reason why you hit your wife or why she and her daughter attacked you. But we do understand that you are the one who started it, you started by hitting her then you made her angry by laughing at her, which is when the mistake on her part and that of her daughter occurred. What we advise you to do is to let your wife come back to you and go back to living together in one home. You should advise your wife to admit that she has made a mistake, and explain to her the seriousness what she has done by disobeying you, hitting you back and encouraging her daughter to misbehave towards you as you mentioned. This girl must understand that she is a guest in the home of her mothers husband and she has to respect the one who has given her refuge in his home. If her presence is making things more complicated and causing more problems, then you must come to some agreement with them for the girl to move to her own home. Seek the help of Allaah, have patience and treat your wife well. We ask Allaah to help you all and create love between your hearts.

2085,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2085,It is forbidden to have a love relationship with anyone except one's husband,"Dear Sheikh,
     I am a Muslim female.  Two years ago I went through a love experience
      with a young Muslim man,who was divorced. I liked him,and in fact I loved him.
   Then he asked me for making love, so I told him that I don't do that as I
      am religious and that this is zinah.
    So he told me i have to make love to you then i will marry you.  Anyway, for two years, he is pushing me and twisting my arm to
      make love with him and that then he will marry me and i keep on refusing sex before
      marriage.
    In spite of all of that I am a strong Muslim and I can stand torture for
      not to commit any sin with him.
    My question is that how can I forget the torture and the very unfair
      behaviour he caused me and what is the status of this man in Islam?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Who has saved you from this man. However, you
    should not have entered into any kind of relationship at all with him, not even meeting or
    speaking with him. He is a stranger to you, who is not related to you in any way, and
    Islam does not allow any kind of love relationship with anyone except ones
    legitimate husband. Repent to Allaah from what has happened, and keep away from this man
    completely, especially since it it quite obvious to you how bad he is and how eager he is
    to commit haraam deeds and pursue fallen women. We ask Allaah to keep us safe and grant us

2086,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2086,It is not permitted to deny a Muslim child his or her inheritance,"I posed a question #1599 a few months ago concerning disinheriting ones offspring particularly if the person disobeys his/her parents in matrimonial matters. For example, if the man marries a non-Muslimah.  It is a commonly held idea that a Muslim man can marry a jewish or christian. These days such a person is hard to find in the west. Religion is as distant from theses people as sun from our planet.
Are today's Catholic protestants etc. truly ""People of the Book""?
It is surley Haraam for a Muslimah to marry a non-Muslim man?  Yet we see this is becoming a trend among many Muslim girls.  May Allah protect us all.
Jazakumallah.",,,"Praise be to Allah.A Muslim is permitted to marry a woman of the People of the Book, Jewish or Christian, so long as she is chaste and modest, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): (Lawful for you in marriage) are chaste women from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before your time [al-Maaidah 5:5]. But this is not recommended, especially for a Muslim who is living in a kaafir country under their laws and legislation.
It is not permissible for a Muslim woman under any circumstances to marry a non-believer (kaafir), whether he is of the People of the Book or otherwise, chaste or not, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): they [believing women] are not lawful (wives) for the disbelievers nor are the disbelievers lawful (husbands) for them [al-Mumtahinah 60:10]
Todays Christians, so long as they claim to belong to, revere and follow Jesus (Eesaa), are among the People of the Book, and the rulings concerning the People of the Book that are recorded in the Quraan and Sunnah apply to them, but at the same time we regard them as kaafirs who have gone astray.
Even if a Muslim son marries a non-Muslim woman, his parents are still not permitted to disinherit him so long as he is still a Muslim and has not committed any offence which would put him beyond the pale of Islam. Anyone who does something that causes a Muslim to be deprived of his inheritance has transgressed the limits of Allaah, wronged himself and committed a grave major sin (kabeerah).

2090,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2090,Why does Allaah    speak in the plural in the Qur’an?,"Why does Allah(SWT) at times speak in the plural form in the Quran?
Jazak Allah Khair.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The answer is in two parts:


In general terms, every believer must believe that every action of Allaah has great wisdom behind it, and there is no need for it to be explained in full to every person. This is a kind of test, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… that He may test you which of you is best in deed…” [al-Mulk 67:2]


To answer this question in more detail: the Qur’aan was revealed in the language of the Arabs, and in Arabic it is as correct to use the plural when speaking of one person as it is to use the singular. But the plural is used for respect and glorification, and no one is more deserving of respect and glorification than Allaah. So the singular is used to affirm the fact that He is One and has no partner or associate, and the plural is used to affirm His glory and majesty, may He be exalted.


Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) wrote in Majmaoo’ al-Fataawaa (5/128) some words which may be of interest to us here:
“With regard to Allaah’s closeness to us, sometimes it is mentioned in the singular, as in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): ‘And when My slaves ask you (O Muhammad) concerning Me, then (answer them) I am indeed near (to them by My knowledge). I respond to the invocations of the supplicant when he calls on Me…’ [al-Baqarah 2:186] and the hadeeth: ‘The One on Whom you call is closer to any one of you than the neck of his riding-camel’, and sometimes in the plural, as in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): ‘… And We are nearer to him than his jugular vein’ [Qaaf 50:16]. This is like the aayaat (interpretation of the meanings): ‘We recite to you…’ [al-Qasas 28:3] and ‘We relate unto you…’ [Yoosuf 12:3]. Such usage in Arabic refers to the one who is great and has helpers who obey him; when his helpers do something by his command, he says ‘We did it,’ as a king might say, ‘We conquered this land and we defeated this army,’ and so on.”
