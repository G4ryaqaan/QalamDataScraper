21701,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21701,Benefitting from the wealth of a father who deals in riba,"I am a young Muslim man and praise be to Allah my father has some money. He heard a fatwa of Shaykh Tantaawi saying that it is permissible to take bank interest, and he put his money in the bank and started to take the interest. I am convinced that this interest is haram, and I have tried a lot to convince him to give up this notion, but without success. 
Is there any sin on me, my brothers and my mother? I asked my father to promise not to spend on us from the money that comes from the interest. What do we have to do? If this money is spent on us, what should we do? Allah has blessed me with work in Saudi and my father paid my travel costs, and I do not know whether this money is from the interest or not. Is the money I get from this work haram or not? I hope you can advise me.",,,"Praise be to Allah.There is no sin on the children of one who deals in riba even if he spends purely riba-derived money on their food, clothes or travel, if they have no other way of earning a living. They have to advise their father in the manner which they think will be most effective. If it is easy to find other means of earning a living, or they do not need that money for the essentials of living, then they have to do without it. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
If the father’s earnings are haram, then it is essential to advise him.  Either you can advise him yourselves, if you are able to do that, or you can seek the help of scholars who can convince him or of his friends who may be able to convince him to avoid these haram earnings. But if that is not possible then you may benefit from it as much as is necessary, and there is no sin on you in this case, but you should not take more than you need because of doubts as to whether it is permissible to benefit from one whose earnings are haram. 
(Fatawa Islamiyyah, 3/452). 
If a father who deals in riba dies, his heirs must get rid of the riba-based money by returning it to its owners if they are known. Otherwise they should get rid of it by spending it in charity, whether that is given individuals or to institutions. If it is too difficult for them to find out exactly how much of their father’s wealth is riba-based, they should divide it in half, taking one half and distributing the other half.  
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah was asked about a man who dealt in riba, and who left behind wealth and a son who knew his father’s situation – was the wealth permissible for the son as inheritance or not? 
He replied: with regard to the amount that the son knows is riba-based, he should get rid of it, either by returning it to its owners if possible, and he should not give it in charity. The rest is not haram for him. With regard to the amount concerning which there is doubt, it is mustahabb for him not to take it unless it is needed to pay off a debt or to spend on dependents. If the father died when engaging in riba-based transactions that are allowed by some fuqaha’, it is permissible for the heir to benefit from them. If the halal and haram are mixed and the extent of each is unknown, it should be divided into two halves.

21705,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21705,How long does tahaarah last after the period for wiping over the socks ends?,"I read that the period for wiping over the socks lasts for one day and one night for one who is not travelling, and three days and three nights for one who is travelling. When this time ends, is the person’s wudoo’ invalidated, or does he remain pure?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
The correct view is that his wudoo’ is not invalidated when the period for wiping over the socks comes to an end. For example, if this times end at 12 noon, but you keep your wudoo’ until night time, you still have wudoo’. That is because there is no evidence to suggest that wudoo’ is broken by the time for wiping over the socks coming to an end. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) set the time limit for wiping over the socks; he did not set a time limit for wudoo’. There is a principle that the seeker of knowledge should pay attention to, which is that what is proven by the shar’i evidence cannot be invalidated without further shar’i evidence, because what is proven remains as it is.","Liqa’ al-Baab al-Maftooh, 44"
21706,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21706,Touching the ‘awrah of a sick person and touching blood,"What is your opinion on the work of a doctor which sometimes requires him to see the ‘awrah of the patient or to touch it for the purpose of examination? Sometimes during operations the doctor makes an incision and gets a lot of blood and urine on his hands. Is it essential to repeat his wudoo’ in such cases, or it is preferable for him to do so?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with the (male) doctor touching a man’s ‘awrah in cases of necessity, or looking at it for the purpose of medical treatment, whether that is the front or the back. He may look at it and touch it in cases of necessity. And there is nothing wrong with touching blood if there is a need to touch it during an operating in order to remove it or to check on the wound. He should wash his hands after that to remove any blood that may have gotten onto them. Touching blood or urine does not invalidate wudoo’, but if he touches the ‘awrah, whether front or back, this invalidates his wudoo’. But touching blood or urine, or other impure substances, does not invalidate wudoo’, rather he should wash off whatever gets onto his hands. But whoever touches the private parts without any barrier in between i.e., skin to skin, invalidates his wudoo’, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever touches his private parts with his hand, with no barrier in between, must do wudoo’.” The same applies to a female doctor if she touches the private part of a woman for an essential reason, this invalidates her wudoo’ if she was in a state of purity, just as in the case of men.","Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah li’l-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 6/20"

21710,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21710,Delaying Making up Fasts: What Should You Do?,"One year I did not fast the days when I had my monthly period, and I have not been able to fast them until now. Many years have gone by and I want to make up the fasts that I owe, but I do not know how many days I have to make up. What should I do?","Delaying making up missed fasts is a sin, so you have to: 1- repent to Allah, 2- hasten to fast the number of days you think you missed, and 3- feed one poor person for each day if you can afford to do that.",,"Praise be to Allah.In case of delaying making up missed fasts , you have to do three things: 

You have to repent to Allah for this delay, and regret your past negligence; you must also resolve not to do such a thing again, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“And all of you beg Allah to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful.” [al-Nur 24:31]
Delaying making up missed fasts is a sin, so it is essential to repent to Allah from that. 

You must hasten to fast the number of days you think you missed, and (remember that) Allah does not burden any person beyond his scope. However many days you think you missed, you have to fast that number of days. So if you think that it was ten days, then fast for ten days; if you think that it was more or less than that, fast as many days as you think, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope.” [al-Baqarah 2:286] 
“So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can.” [al-Taghabun 64:16]

Feed one poor person for each day if you can afford to do that, even if you give it all to one poor person. But if you are poor and cannot feed another person, then you do not have to do anything apart from fasting and repenting. 

What is meant by feeding a poor person here is giving half a sa’ of the local staple food for each day; half a sa’ is equivalent to one and a half kilograms.

    was a kaafir king. There happened between him and Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) that which Allaah describes in the verse (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 
“Have you not looked at him who disputed 
    with Ibraaheem (Abraham) about his Lord (Allaah), because Allaah had given him the kingdom? When Ibraaheem (Abraham) said (to him): ‘My Lord (Allaah) 
    is He Who gives life and causes death.’ He said, ‘I give life and cause death.’ Ibraaheem (Abraham) said, ‘Verily, Allaah brings the sun from the 
    east; then bring it you from the west.’ So the disbeliever was utterly defeated. And Allaah guides not the people, who are Zaalimoon (wrongdoers)”
[al-Baqarah 2:258]
There is no story about him and any child 
    that can be proven, as far as we know. 
But if you are asking about the story of the 
    believing boy and the kaafir king, and how the boy was killed and the people believed in Allaah, and they bore persecution for that, this is the 
    story of the people of the ditch, which was narrated by Muslim (3005) from the hadeeth of Suhayb (may Allaah be pleased with him), which says that 
    the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Among those who came before you there lived a king who had a (court) sorcerer. As he (the sorcerer) grew 
    old, he said to the king: ‘I have grown old, so send some young boy to me so that I may teach him magic.’ He (the king) sent a boy to him so that 
    he might train him (in magic). On his way to the sorcerer he (the boy) met a monk and sat with him. He (the boy) listened to his (the monk's) talk 
    and was impressed by it. So whenever he went to the sorcerer he would pass by the monk and sit with him. And when he came to the sorcerer, he (the 
    sorcerer) beat him. He complained about it to the monk and he said to him: ‘When you feel afraid of the sorcerer, say: My family made me late. And 
    when you feel afraid of your family, say: The sorcerer made me late.’ It so happened that there came a huge beast (of prey) and it blocked the way 
    of the people. He (the young boy) said: I shall find out today whether the sorcerer or the monk is superior. He picked up a stone and said: O 
    Allaah, if the affairs of the monk are dearer to You than the affairs of the sorcerer, bring death to this animal so that the people will be able 
    to move about freely. He threw that stone at it and killed it and the people were able to pass freely. He (the boy) then came to that monk and 
    told him (what had happened). The monk said: My son, today you are better than me. Your affairs have reached a stage where I think that you will 
    be soon put to the test, and in case you are put to the test do not reveal my identity. That young man began to heal the blind and those suffering 
    from leprosy and he began to cure people of (all kinds) of illness. When a companion of the king, who had become blind, heard about him, he came 
    to him with numerous gifts and said: If you heal me, all these things here will be yours. He said: I myself do not heal anyone; it is Allaah Who 
    heals. If you believe in Allaah, I shall also pray to Allaah to heal you. He believed in Allaah and Allaah healed him. He came to the king and sat 
    by his side as he used to sit before. The king said to him: Who restored your eyesight? He said: My Lord. He asked, Do you have any Lord other 
    than me? He said: My Lord and your Lord is Allaah; so he (the king) took hold of him and tortured him until he revealed the identity of the boy. 
    The boy was then summoned and the king said to him: O boy, it has been conveyed to me that you have become so proficient in your magic that you 
    heal the blind and those suffering from leprosy and you do such and such things. Thereupon he said: I do not heal anyone; it is Allah Who heals. 
    He (the king) took hold of him and began to torture him. So he revealed the identity of the monk. The monk was thus summoned and it was said to 
    him: Turn back from your religion. But he refused to do so. He (ordered) a saw to be brought and he (the king) placed it in the middle of his head 
    and cut it until it fell apart. Then the courtier of the king was brought and it was said to him: Turn back from your religion, but he refused to 
    do so. So the saw was placed in the middle of his head and it was cut until it fell apart. Then the boy was brought and it was said to him: Turn 
    back from your religion. He refused to do so and he was handed over to a group of his courtiers. He said to them: Take him to such and such a 
    mountain; make him climb that mountain and when you reach its top (ask him to renounce his faith) but if he refuses to do so, then throw him (down 
    the mountain). So they took him and made him climb the mountain and he said: O Allaah, save me from them however You will. The mountain began to 
    shake and they all fell down, and the boy came walking back to the king. The king said to him: What has happened to your companions? He said: 
    Allaah has saved me from them. He again handed him to some of his courtiers and said: Take him and carry him away in a small boat and when you 
    reach the middle of the ocean (ask him to renounce) his religion, but if he does not renounce his religion throw him (into the water). So they 
    took him and he said: O Allaah, save me from them and what they want to do. It was not long before the boat overturned and they were drowned but 
    he came walking back to the king. The king said to him: What has happened to your companions? He said: Allaah has saved me from them. He also said 
    to the king: You cannot kill me until you do what I ask you to do. And he said: What is that? He said: You should gather people in a plain and 
    crucify me on the trunk (of a tree). Then take an arrow from my quiver and say: In the name of Allaah, the Lord of the boy; then shoot an arrow 
    and if you do that then you would be able to kill me. So he (the king) called the people to an open plain and crucified him (the boy) on the trunk 
    of a tree. Then he took an arrow from his quiver, placed the arrow in the bow and then said: In the name of Allaah, the Lord of the boy; he then 
    shot an arrow and it hit his temple. He (the boy) placed his hands upon the temple where the arrow had hit him and he died. The people said: We 
    believe in the Lord of this boy, we believe in the Lord of this boy, we believe in the Lord of this boy. Some people came to the king and said to 
    him: Do you realize that you what feared has happened? All the people now believe (in the Lord of the boy). He (the king) commanded ditches to be 
    dug at the entry-points of the roads. When these ditches were dug, and fires was lit in them it was said (to the people): He who does not turn 
    back from his (the boy's) religion will be thrown in the fire or they will be told to jump in it. So they started to do that until a woman came 
    with her child and she hesitated to jump into the fire. Then her child said to her: O mother, be patient, for you are following the Truth.” 
Your saying in your question “Hazrat 
    Ibraaheem” is an innovated expression which is best avoided, because for the Prophets (peace be upon them) there is an expression which is used 
    only for them, namely “al-salaatu wa’l-salaamu ‘alayhim (blessings and peace be upon them). There is scholarly consensus on this point, as was 
    narrated by Ibn al-Qayyim in Jala’ al-Afhaam from Imam al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on them both)

1-His grave is furnished from Paradise for him
2-He is clothed in garments from Paradise.
3-A gate to Paradise is opened for him, and its breezes come to him, and he smells its fragrance and he feels delight in what he can see of its blessings.
4-His grave is made wide and spacious for him.
5-He is given the glad tidings of Allaah’s pleasure and Paradise. Hence he longs for the Hour to begin.

They bring with them shrouds from Paradise and perfumes from Paradise. Then the Angel of Death comes and sits by his head, and he says, ‘O good soul, come forth to forgiveness from Allaah and His pleasure.’ Then it comes out easily like a drop of water from the mouth of a waterskin. When he seizes it, they do not leave it in his hand for an instant before they take it and put it in that shroud with that perfume, and there comes from it a fragrance like the finest musk on the face of the earth. Then they ascend and they do not pass by any group of angels but they say, ‘Who is this good soul?’ and they say, ‘It is So and so the son of So and so, calling him by the best names by which he was known in this world, until they reach the lowest heaven. They ask for it to be opened to them and it is opened, and (the soul) is welcomed and accompanied to the next heaven by those who are closest to Allaah, until they reach the seventh heaven. Then Allaah says: ‘Record the book of My slave in ‘Illiyoon in the seventh heaven, and return him to the earth, for from it I created them, to it I will return them and from it I will bring them forth once again.’ So his soul is returned to his body and there come to him two angels who make him sit up and they say to him, ‘Who is your Lord?’ He says, ‘Allaah.’ They say, ‘What is your religion?’ He says, ‘My religion is Islam.’ They say, ‘Who is this man who was sent among you?’ He says, ‘He is the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).’ They say, ‘What did you do?’ He says, ‘I read the Book of Allaah and I believed in it.’ Then a voice calls out from heaven, ‘My slave has spoken the truth, so prepare for him a bed from Paradise and clothe him from Paradise, and open for him a gate to Paradise.’ Then there comes to him some of its fragrance, and his grave is made wide, as far as he can see. Then there comes to him a man with a handsome face and handsome clothes, and a good fragrance, who says, ‘Receive the glad tidings that will bring you joy this day.’ He says, ‘Who are you? Your face is a face which brings glad tidings.’ He says, ‘I am your righteous deeds.’ He says, ‘O Lord, hasten the Hour so that I may return to my family and my wealth.’…”

But if he is a kaafir or a hypocrite, (the angel) says to him, ‘What do you say about this man?’ He says, ‘I do not know, I heard the people saying something.’ The angel says, ‘You did not know and you did not follow those who knew and you were not guided.’ Then a door to Paradise is opened for him and he says, ‘This would have been your position if you had believed in your Lord. But because you disbelieved, Allaah has replaced it for you with this.’ Then a gate to Hell is opened for him, and he strikes him a blow with the hammer which is heard by all of Allaah’s creation apart from the two races (of mankind and the jinn).” Some of the people said, “O Messenger of Allaah, there is no one who would have an angel standing by him holding a hammer but he would dumbfounded.” The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah will keep firm those who believe, with the word that stands firm.” [Ibraaheem 14:27 – interpretation of the meaning]

With regard to paying

    no excuse has committed a sin, because the evidence of the Qur’aan and

    becomes due. So he has to repent sincerely to Allaah. 
Secondly, whoever is 
    obliged to pay zakaah and does not do so at the specified time has to pay it

“If he is certain about 
    the amount then he should pay it, and if he is not certain about the amount

Saying the Basmalah when reading the Quran


Meaning of ”Iqra bismi Rabbika”","Praise be to Allah.What does Bismillah mean?
When one says “Bismillah ” when starting to do anything, what that means is, “I start this action accompanied by the name of Allah or seeking help through the name of Allah, seeking blessing thereby. Allah is God, the beloved and worshipped, to Whom hearts turn in love, veneration and obedience (worship). He is al-Rahman (the Most Gracious) Whose attribute is vast mercy; and al-Rahim (the Most Merciful) Who causes that mercy to reach His creation. 
It was said that what this means is: I start this action by mentioning the name of Allah. 
Ibn Jarir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Allah, may He be exalted and His name sanctified, taught His Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) proper manners by teaching him to mention His most beautiful names before all his actions. He commanded him to mention these attributes before starting to do anything, and made what He taught him a way for all people to follow before starting anything, words to be written at the beginning of their letters and books. The apparent meaning of these words indicates exactly what is meant by them, and it does not need to be spelled out.” 
There is something omitted in the phrase “Bismillah” when it said before starting to do something, which may be “I begin my action in the name of Allah,” such as saying, “In the name of Allah I read”, “In the name of Allah I write”, “In the name of Allah I ride”, and so on. Or, “My starting is in the name of Allah”, “My riding is in the name of Allah”, “My reading is in the name of Allah”, and so on.  It may be that blessing comes by saying the name of Allah first, and that also conveys the meaning of starting only in the name of Allah and not in the name of anyone else. 
The name of Allah is the greatest name and is so well known as to need no explanation; this is a name that belongs exclusively to the Creator and no one else. The correct view is that it is derived from the root ilah. He is God (ilah) which means that He is worshipped and is divine. 
Al-Rahman is one of the names of Allah that belong exclusively to Him. It means the One Who possesses vast mercy, because this form (fa’lan) is indicative of fullness and abundance. It is the most exclusive name of Allah after His name Allah, just as mercy is His most exclusive attribute. Hence this name (al-Rahman) often appears after the name Allah, as in the ayah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say (O Muhammad): Invoke Allah or invoke the Most Gracious [al-Rahman] (Allah)” [al-Isra 17:110]
Al-Rahim is also one of the names of Allah, and means the One Who causes His mercy to reach those whom He wills among His slaves.  
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Al-Rahman refers to an attribute that is connected to Allah and is part of His Essence, and al-Rahim refers to a connection with the one to whom mercy is shown. The former is adjectival (referring to what He is) and the latter is verbal (referring to what He does). The former indicates that mercy is His attribute, and the latter indicates that He bestows His mercy upon His creation. If you want to understand this then ponder the meaning of these verses (interpretation of the meanings): 
“And He is Ever Most Merciful (Rahim) to the believers”[al-Ahzab 33:43]  
“Certainly, He is unto them full of kindness, Most Merciful (Rahim)” [al-Tawbah 9:117]
The word al-Rahman is never used in this context. So we know that the word Rahman means the One Whose attribute is mercy (rahmah), and al-Rahim is the One Who bestows His mercy.” (Badai’ al-Fawaid, 1/24) 
Saying the Basmalah when reading the Quran
The ruling on saying the Basmalah before reading Quran depends on the situation: 

If it is at the beginning of a surah – apart from Surat Bara-ah (al-Tawbah) – then the majority of imams have stated that “it is mustahabb to recite the Basmalah at the beginning of each surah, in prayer or otherwise.

This should be done as a regular practice, and some of them considered that a reading of the whole Quran is incomplete if the Basmalah was not recited at the beginning of every surah apart from Bara-ah (al-Tawbah).” When Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about reciting it at the beginning of every surah, he said, “Do not neglect it.” 

If one is starting in the middle of a surah – which is the case asked about in the question – then the majority of scholars and Quran readers say that there is no reason why one should not start with it. 

It was said to Imam Ahmad, after he had said that it should not be omitted at the beginning of the surah, “What if a person starts reading part way through a surah?” He said, “There is nothing wrong [with saying the Basmalah].” Al-Abadi narrated that al-Shafi’i (may Allah have mercy on him) regarded it as mustahabb (to say the Basmalah, when starting to recite) part way through a surah.
The Quran readers said: It is certain that one should say the Basmalah if the ayah which will be read after saying it contains a pronoun that refers to Allah, such as the verses (interpretation of the meanings): 
“To Him (Alone) is referred the knowledge of the Hour” [Fussilat 41:47] 
“And it is He Who produces gardens” [al-An’am 6:141] because otherwise, if one recites these verses after seeking refuge with Allah from the Shaytan, the pronoun may appear to refer to the Shaytan which would convey an abhorrent meaning. 

Reciting the Basmalah at the beginning of Surat Bara-ah (al-Tawbah); there is hardly any dispute among the scholars that doing this is makruh (disliked). 

Salih said concerning some issues that he narrated from his father Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him): “I asked him about Surah al-Anfal and Surat al-Tawbah, whether it is permissible for a man to separate them by saying Bismillah al-Rahman al-Rahim. My father said: ‘With regard to the Quran, reference should be made to what the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) were agreed on; nothing should be added to or taken away from that.’”  

Reciting it part way through Surat al-Bara-ah (al-Tawbah) . The Quran readers differed concerning that, as was narrated by Ibn Hajar al-Haythami in al-Fatawa al-Fiqhiyyah (1/52), and he said: “Among the leading Quran readers, al-Sakhawi said that there is no dispute that it is Sunnah to start with the Basmalah when one starts reading part way through this surah [al-Tawbah], as he differentiated between starting at the beginning and starting in the middle, but his explanation was facile and was refuted by al-Ja’bari from among the Quran readers. This is more likely (i.e., the view that it is makruh is more likely to be correct), because the reason why the Basmalah should not be recited at the beginning (of al-Tawbah) is that it came with the sword (i.e., the command to fight the kuffar) and it exposes the hypocrites and their foul deeds in a manner that is not unlike any other surah, and this theme is repeated throughout Surat al-Tawbah. Therefore it is not prescribed to recite the Basmalah even if one starts reciting part way through this surah, just as it is not prescribed at the beginning, for the reasons we have established.” 

See al-Adab al-Shar’iyyah by Ibn Muflih, 2/325; al-Mawsu’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 13/253; al-Fatawa al-Fiqhiyyah al-Kubra, 1/52 
Meaning of ”Iqra bismi Rabbika”
With regard to the meaning of the words, “Iqra bismi Rabbika” (Read (or recite) in the name of your Lord – [al-‘Alaq 96:1 – interpretation of the meaning]), Imam Ibn Jarir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The interpretation of the words ‘Iqra bismi Rabbika’ is that they were addressed to Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), in other words, Read, O Muhammad, by mentioning the name of your Lord (Who created).”

It is permissible for a man to have intercourse with his pregnant wife whenever he wants, unless that will cause her harm, for it is haram for him to do anything that will harm her. 
If it will not cause her harm but it is difficult for her, then it is better for him not to have intercourse with her, because avoiding things which are difficult for her is a kind of living with them honourably. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“and live with them honourably.” [al-Nisa 4:19]
Sex during menses in Islam
But it is haram for a man to have intercourse with his wife when she is menstruating , or to have intercourse with her in her back passage , or to have intercourse with her when she is in nifas (bleeding following childbirth). That is haram and is not permitted, and a man must avoid that and do that which Allah has permitted.
If she is menstruating then he may enjoy her in other ways, apart from the vagina and back passage, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do whatever you like apart from intercourse.” (Narrated by Muslim, al-Hayd, 455).

21734,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21734,Does saying Bismillaah at the time of intercourse protect one against major sins?,Does saying Bismillaah at the time of intercourse protect the child from committing major sins?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Saying Bismillaah at the time of intercourse is mentioned in the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “If one of you says, when he has intercourse with his wife: ‘Bismillaah, Allaahumma jannibni al-Shaytaana wa jannib al-Shaytaana ma razaqtana (In the name of Allaah, O Allaah, keep the Shaytaan away from me and keep the Shaytaan away from that which You bestow upon us),’ if it is decreed that they should have a child, the Shaytaan will never harm him.”  
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5165; Muslim, 1434. 
With regard to how this benefits the child, the scholars differed as to what is meant by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “the Shaytaan will never harm him.” There are many opinions: 
1-      That what it means is that the Shaytaan will not control him because of the blessing of saying Bismillaah, rather he will be one of the people of whom it was said: “Certainly, you shall have no authority over My slaves” [al-Hijr 15:42].
2-      It means that he will never harm him physically.
3-      It means that this is a means of his being protected from shirk and kufr.
4-      It means that he will keep away from major sins.
5-      And it was said that he will not be harmed by the Shaytaan’s participation in his father’s having intercourse with his mother, as it was narrated that Mujaahid said: The one who has intercourse and does not say Bismillaah, the Shaytaan wraps himself around his penis and has intercourse along with him. 
Ibn Hajar said: Perhaps this is the most correct answer. But the first answer may also be correct, especially since we know that many people who know about the great blessing of saying Bismillaah may forget all about it at the time of intercourse, and for the few who may remember it and say it, pregnancy may not occur.

One of the matters to which the married woman should pay attention concerning her parents is that she should strive to visit them from time to time, and give them appropriate gifts even if they have no real material value. She should try to avoid letting her children’s misbehaviour annoy them when visiting them, and avoid telling them about marital disagreements.

Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“That is because Allaah  He is the Truth (the only True God of all that exists, Who has no partners or rivals with Him), and what they (the polytheists) invoke besides Him, it is Baatil (falsehood). And verily, Allaah He is the Most High, the Most Great”[al-Hajj 22:62]
So the words laa ilaaha (there is no god) deny all things that are worshipped instead of Allaah, and the words illa Allaah (except Allaah) affirm that all kinds of worship are for Allaah alone. So what they mean is that there is none that is rightfully worshipped except Allaah. 
Just as Allaah has no partner in His dominion, so too He has no partner in His worship. 
What it means to bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah is tobelieve firmly, from the depths of one's heart, and express it on one's lips, that Muhammad is His slave and His Messenger to all of creation, mankind and the jinn alike.  That means believing what he has told us about events in the past, what he has told us about things that are yet to come, what he has permitted of halaal things, what he has forbidden of haraam things; and it means obeying and following what he has commanded, and giving up and avoiding what he has forbidden, following his laws, adhering to his Sunnah in secret and in the open, accepting and submitting to his judgements, and knowing that obedience to him is obedience to Allaah, and disobedience to him is disobedience to Allaah, because he is the one who conveyed the Message from Allaah, and Allaah did not cause him to die until He had perfected the religion, and he conveyed it clearly. May Allaah reward him on behalf of us with the best reward that was ever given to any Prophet on behalf of his people and any Messenger on behalf of his nation. 
A person can only enter Islam by uttering this twin testimony of faith; its two parts are intertwined and cannot be separated.

Rather we should ask whether it was one of the Sunnahs of ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab, because it was not done at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) but it was done in ‘Umar’s time, or was it one of the Sunnahs of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)? 
Some people claim that it was one of the Sunnahs of ‘Umar, and they base that on the fact that ‘Umar “commanded Ubayy ibn Ka’b and Tameem al-Daari to lead the people in praying eleven rak’ahs.” He went out the same night and saw the people praying, and he said, “What a good innovation this is.” This indicates that it had not previously been prescribed… 
But this opinion is da’eef (weak), and those who say this are ignoring the reports proven in al-Saheehayn and elsewhere, that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)  “led his companions in praying for three nights, and on the third or fourth night he did not lead them, and he said: ‘I am afraid that it may be made obligatory upon you.’” This was narrated by al-Bukhaari (872). According to a version narrated by Muslim, “But I was afraid that prayer at night may be made obligatory upon you, and you would not be able to do it.” (1271).  So it is proven that Tarawih is part of the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) referred to the reason why he did not persist in it, which was the fear that it might become obligatory; he did not say that it is not prescribed. This fear no longer applied following the death of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), because when he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) died, the revelation ceased and there was no longer any concern that it might become obligatory. Once the fear that it might become obligatory was no longer present, because the revelation had ceased, then the reason for not doing it was also removed, and so it was restored to its position of being Sunnah. 
See al-Sharh al-Mumti’ by Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, vol. 4, p. 78. 
It was narrated in al-Saheehayn from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would forgo doing something that he liked to do lest the people do it and it become obligatory upon them. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1060; Muslim, Salaat al-Musaafireen, 1174). 
Al-Nawawi said: This shows how kind he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was and how compassionate towards his ummah. 
So there is no basis for saying that Tarawih prayer is not part of the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), rather it is part of the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), but he forsook it for fear that it may be made obligatory upon his ummah. When he died, this concern no longer applied. Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) was distracted by the wars against the apostates and his reign was short, lasting only two years. When the reign of ‘Umar came and the Muslims became secure and victorious, he commanded the people to gather together for Tarawih prayers in Ramadan, as they used to gather with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). All that ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) did was to go back to that Sunnah and revive it. And Allah is the Source of strength.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

21745,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21745,Is intercourse in the Bathroom Permissible in Islam?,What is the ruling on a man having intercourse with his wife in the bathroom? Some people take a bath with their wives and may become aroused. What is the answer?,"Modern bathrooms can be kept clean and there is no impurity in them. On this basis, there is no real reason why one should not have intercourse with his wife in the bathroom when necessary.",,"Praise be to Allah.My brother, may Allah help you to do that which is good and make you satisfied with that which He has permitted you so that you will have no need for that which He has forbidden. What you have mentioned in your question may be answered by noting the following: 

The modern kinds of washrooms in modern houses such as those in your country differ greatly from the places used in the past for relieving oneself, which were places where dirt, filth and impurities collected. Modern washrooms are not like that, rather they can be kept clean and there is no impurity in them. Therefore they are not like the places that people used for relieving themselves in the past, and there are obvious differences between them. On this basis, there is no real reason why one should not fulfil one's sexual desire in such places when necessary, in the manner that you mentioned.
A man’s fulfilling his sexual desire with his wife may often happen as the result of stimulation, by looking or touching etc. Hence fulfilling his desire when it is provoked in such situations is a means of keeping himself chaste and lowering his gaze [from looking at other women]. This is what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught us to do, according to the Hadith narrated by Muslim (1403) from Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him), who says that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw a woman and he came to his wife Zaynab (may Allah be pleased with her), whilst she was tanning a skin and preparing it for dyeing, and he fulfilled his need. Then he went out to his companions and said: “Woman comes and goes in the shape of a devil [i.e., she causes temptation], so if any one of you sees a woman, let him go and have intercourse with his wife , for that will take away what he feels in his heart.” This was also narrated by Ahmad, 19403; Ibn Majah, 1853. Ibn Hibban narrated in his Sahih, 4171, that ‘Abdallah ibn Abu Awfa (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘No woman fulfils all her duties towards Allah until she fulfils all her duties towards her husband. If he asks her [for his conjugal rights] even when she is on the back of a camel, she should respond to him.’” 


At the same time, the Muslim should not forget, when his desire is provoked, to bear in mind the intention of keeping chaste and of enjoying that which is good and permissible. Then doing that will be an act of righteousness on his part, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “In the intimacy of any one of you there is reward.” They said, “O Messenger of Allah, if any one of us fulfils his desire will there be reward for him in that?” He said, “Do you not see that if he does it in a prohibited way, that will be a sin on him? So if he does it in a permissible way, he will be rewarded for that.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1006, from the Hadith of Abu Dharr). A man should also recite the Du`a that was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) for this situation. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When any one of you wants to have intercourse with his wife, let him say: ‘Bismillaah, Allahumma jannibna ash-Shaytana wa jannib ash-Shaytana ma razaqtana (In the name of Allah, O Allah, keep the devil away from us and from that with which You may bless us)’, then if it is decreed that they should have a child from that, the devil will never be able to harm him.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 6388; Muslim, 1434, from the Hadith of `Abdallah ibn `Abbas)

21748,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21748,When is the “hour of response” on Friday?,"Is the last hour of ‘Asr on Friday the “hour of response”? Does the Muslim have to be in the mosque at this time, and do women have to be at home?",,,"Praise be to Allah.There are two opinions concerning the hour of response on Friday which are likely to be correct: 
The first is that it lasts from after ‘Asr until the sun sets, for those who sit and wait for Maghrib, whether that is in the mosque or at home, making du`a to their Lord, whether they are men or women; whoever does that is more deserving of seeing a response to his or her du`a. But men should not pray Maghrib or any other prayer at home unless they have a legitimate shar’i excuse, as is well known from the evidence of sharee’ah. 
The second is that it lasts from the time when the imaam sits on the minbar to deliver the khutbah on Friday until he finishes the prayer. Du`a at either of these times is deserving of being answered.
 These two times are more likely to be the times of response on Friday, because of the saheeh ahaadeeth which indicate that. The hour of response may also be sought at other times of the day. And the bounty of Allah is great. 
Among the moments when response may come to a du`a in all prayers, obligatory and naafil alike, is the moment of sujood (prostration), because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The closest that a person may be to his Lord is when he is prostrating, so say a great deal of du`a in sujood.” (Narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh from the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), in al-Salaah, 482). And Muslim (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated in his Saheeh from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with them both) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “As for rukoo’ (bowing), proclaim the greatness of your Lord in rukoo’ and strive in du`a, for you will be more deserving of being responded to.” (Muslim, al-Salaah, 479).","Shaykh Ibn Baaz, Majallat al-Buhooth, issue no. 34, p. 142"
21756,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21756,How to Pray Witr If You Combine Maghrib with Isha,What is the ruling on praying Witr at the time of `Isha’ when travelling and shortening the obligatory prayers?,Travelling is a reason which permits the four-Rak`ah prayers to be shortened to two Rak`ah. The traveller may pray Witr after praying `Isha with Maghrib and praying them at the time of Maghrib.,"Shortening prayers while travelling 


Praying Witr when combining ‘Isha with Maghrib","Praise be to Allah.Shortening prayers while travelling 
“Travelling is a reason which permits the four-Rak`ah prayers to be shortened to two Rak`ahs , rather it – i.e. travel – is the reason which dictates shortening four Rak`ah prayers to two Rak`ahs , and this is either obligatory or recommended, depending on the differences in scholarly opinion. 
The correct view is that shortening prayers is recommended and is not obligatory; although there are some texts which apparently indicate that it is obligatory, there are other texts which indicate that it is not obligatory.” 
The four-Rak`ah prayers are Dhuhr, `Asr and `Isha, and the evidence for that is the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and the consensus of the ummah. 
In the Quran, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And when you (Muslims) travel in the land, there is no sin on you if you shorten the prayer if you fear that the disbelievers may put you in trial (attack you).” [An-Nisa’ 4:101]
And evidence is to be found in the actions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) travelled, he would pray two Rak`ahs. It was not narrated from him that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ever prayed four Rak`ahs whilst travelling, rather during all of his journeys, long and short, he would pray two Rak`ahs .” 
With regard to the consensus of the Muslims, this is something which is a well-known and well-established part of the religion, as Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I prayed behind the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and Abu Bakr, ‘Umar and `Uthmaan, and they never prayed more than two Rak`ahs when travelling.” And the Muslims are agreed upon that. 
Praying Witr when combining ‘Isha with Maghrib 
The traveller may pray Witr after praying `Isha with Maghrib and praying them at the time of Maghrib.” (See Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, vol. 1, p. 412; al-Sharh al-Mumti’, vol. 4, p. 502; Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, vol. 8, p. 144)

21757,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21757,Muslim attitudes towards violence and how to react to kaafir aggression against the Muslim community,"In view of the critical situation which we Muslims are now facing in America, with aggression – which may reach the point of killing – shots being fired at mosques, women with hijaab being harassed in the streets, assaults against Muslim students in schools and universities, persecution of some Muslim employees in their workplaces, all because of the recent events in which some Muslim persons are being accused of causing explosions in the capital and elsewhere, we want to ask whether it is permissible for us to forego praying in jamaa’ah or praying Jumu’ah in the mosque? And what about our women’s hijaab? And what is the ruling on us foregoing Islamic dress?",,,"Praise be to Allah.and blessings and peace be upon the Messenger of Allaah. 
What we have heard about what our Muslim brothers are going through in kaafir countries in the north and the south, where they are being harassed and persecuted for something in which they did not take part and in which they played no role, is not strange, given the wrongdoing and hatred of the kuffaar, even though they claim to be the people of justice, fairness and freedom. What is the crime of a Muslim woman who walks down the street in her hijaab? What is the crime of a Muslim who leaves his home to go and pray, not to spread mischief in the land? What is the crime of a Muslim employee who goes to his company or a student who goes to his university or a schoolgirl who is walking to her school, not going out to bomb and destroy? If the western man in the street was fair-minded – at least with himself – he would go and take revenge on the people who plotted and took part in harming him. But one who does not fear God could do anything, and the very least that the Muslims will be faced with is curses and insults. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and you shall certainly hear much that will grieve you from those who received the Scripture before you (Jews and Christians) and from those who ascribe partners to Allaah; but if you persevere patiently, and become Al-Muttaqoon (the pious) then verily, that will be a determining factor in all affairs”[Aal ‘Imraan 3:186]
Our attitude must be clear; we must explain to the kuffaar the ruling of Islamic sharee’ah concerning harming and killing others. We should tell them that Islam forbids harming innocent people in any way, whether that involves harming their bodies, their wealth or their honour. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There should be neither harming nor reciprocating harm.” It is not permissible to kill a kaafir who is not hostile or who has a legitimate peace treaty with the Muslims; rather treating a non-hostile kaafir with kindness is part of the Islamic religion, especially if that is done to call him to Islam and soften his heart (towards Islam). Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allaah does not forbid you to deal justly and kindly with those who fought not against you on account of religion nor drove you out of your homes. Verily, Allaah loves those who deal with equity”[al-Mumtahinah 60:8]
At times of war against the kuffaar, it is not permissible for a Muslim to deliberately kill a kaafir child or woman who is not bearing arms against the Muslims or helping in the fight. It was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to the Muslim army: “Go out in the name of Allaah and by the help of Allaah, following the way of the Messenger of Allaah. Do not kill any old man, infant, child or woman… spread goodness and do good, for Allaah loves those who do good.” (Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2614; its isnaad includes Khaalid ibn al-Faraz, of whom Ibn Hajar said in al-Taqreeb, he is maqbool (acceptable) i.e., if there are corroborating reports) 
This is supported by the advice which Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq (may Allaah be pleased with him) gave to the commander of his army: “I advise you of ten things: do not kill a woman, or a child, or any old person, or cut down any fruit trees…” (al-Muwatta’, 982, Kitaab al-Jihaad). 
The kaafirs whom the Muslims fight and inflict harm and loss upon are the kaafirs who fight the Muslims and drive them out of their homes, or help to drive them out of their homes and punish and mistreat them, and who stand in the way of calling people to Islam and prevent people from following the path of Allaah, and prevent the spread of Islam. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“It is only as regards those who fought against you on account of religion, and have driven you out of your homes, and helped to drive you out, that Allaah forbids you to befriend them. And whosoever will befriend them, then such are the Zaalimoon (wrongdoers those who disobey Allaah).”[al-Mumtahinah 60:9]
Such people are to be fought against when [the Muslims] have the power to do so, and when fighting them and declaring jihad against them is more likely to serve a purpose. But when you can achieve your purpose with gentleness and kindness, it is not right to resort to violence and force. Muslims should only use force when they are compelled to, and as a last resort. They should not initiate fighting, unless there is some cause on the part of the kaafirs, such as their fighting the Muslims, or helping other enemies of the Muslims, or preventing them from following the path of Allaah and establishing the law of Allaah in the land. 
We should also remind these kaafirs of the massacres which have been carried out and are still being carried out against Muslims in all parts of the world, in Bosnia, Kosova, Chechnya, Palestine and Kashmir, which are being supported by Jews, Christians and others. Is the blood of the Muslims cheaper than the blood of others? Should there be mourners for non-Muslims who are killed and not for Muslims who are killed? 
Moreover, when the Orthodox Christians carried out massacres in Bosnia and Kosova, in which the numbers of those killed exceeded 200,000, apart from those who were wounded or raped, and the economic losses that resulted, did the Muslims in the Arab and Islamic countries launch attacks against the Orthodox Christians who live in their countries, or kill any of them, or open fire against their churches and subject them to terror?! What does this tell you? 
It is very important for Muslims to explain these things to non-Muslims, in order to establish proof against the kuffaar. This is something that Allaah wants. Secondly, among the kuffaar there are intelligent and fair-minded people, and people who are receptive to the guidance of Islam; perhaps they will be affected by a clear explanation. Thirdly, no Muslim should permit himself to be accused without explaining his innocence. The distorted image of Muslims is one of the things that is keeping the kaafirs away from the truth and being affected by the Muslims; indeed it may make them treat the Muslims like outcasts, resulting in additional wrongdoing towards the Muslims. 
With regard to the question, it is permissible for a Muslim at times of tribulation, when they cannot walk safely through the streets or reach the mosque safe and sound, to pray at home and not attend prayers in jamaa’ah. But we must examine the situation more carefully before deciding not to attend Jumu’ah prayer because of its extreme importance. So we should not stop praying in jamaa’ah or stop attending Jumu’ah prayers on the grounds of mere speculation or an unlikely possibility of aggression. Rather if a person is certain or believes it to be most likely that he will be attacked if he goes to the mosque, then it is permissible for him not to go.
Among the opinions of the scholars concerning the permissibility of refraining from going to Jumu’ah prayers or prayers in jamaa’ah because of fear is the comment of Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) who said: “The one who is sick and the one who is afraid is excused from attending them – i.e., Jumu’ah and prayers in jamaa’ah – according to the view of most of the scholars. Ibn ‘Abbaas narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Whoever hears the call to prayer and is not prevented from responding by an excuse –’ They said, ‘What is the excuse, O Messenger of Allaah?’ He said, ‘Fear or sickness, (otherwise) the prayer that he offers will not be accepted.’” (narrated by Abu Dawood, 1/130. Shaykh al-Albaani classed this version of the hadeeth as da’eef (weak), but he classed as saheeh (sound) the version narrated by Ibn Maajah, 793, which says: “Whoever hears the call and does not come, his prayer is not valid, except for one who has an excuse.” Al-Irwaa’ 2/337). And Bilaal used to give the call to prayer; one day the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came when he was sick, and said, ‘Tell Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer.’” (al-Bukhaari, 633; Muslim, 418) 
Fear is of three kinds: fear for oneself, fear for one’s wealth, and fear for one’s family. The first kind means fearing capture by an oppressive ruler, or an enemy, or a thief, or attack by wild animals, or a flood, etc., which may cause harm to oneself.
 The second kind means fear for one’s wealth if one leaves home, as we have mentioned, such as oppressive rulers, thieves and the like, or fear that one’s house may be broken into or burned down or something like that; in such cases one is excused from attending Jumu’ah and prayers in jamaa’ah.  
The third kind means fear for one’s child and family. In all such cases one is excused from attending Jumu’ah and prayers in jamaa’ah. This was the view of ‘Ataa’, al-Hasan, al-Oozaa’i and al-Shaafa’i, and we know of no difference of opinion concerning this matter.”
(summarized from al-Mughni, 2/376). 
In Fataawa al-Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz, when a man asked him about refraining from attending prayers in jamaa’ah because he was afraid for his wife, he said, “If there is some danger to your wife (at home) and she is not safe, and she is surrounded by things which give rise to fear, then he is excused for praying at home because of his fear for his wife…” Then he said: “But if your wife is not safe and the place is not safe, and danger is present, then it is o.k. for you to pray at home; this is a legitimate excuse…” 
Majmoo’ Fataawa Samaahat al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him), 12/42 
With regard to Muslim women, they should stay in their homes and not go out – as much as they can – lest they be exposed to harm. Their relatives and neighbours should help them to meet their needs so that they will not be forced to go out. This is a means of earning great reward by helping those who are in desperate need. 
With regard to Muslim men giving up distinctive Islamic dress and wearing the clothes commonly found in the kaafir society in which he lives, that is o.k., especially at times of persecution and harassment. Imaam Ibn Taymiyah said: 
“The Muslim in a kaafir country that is at war with the Muslims or otherwise is not commanded to differ from them in outward appearance, because of the harm that may result from that. Rather it is recommended or obligatory for men to resemble them sometimes in his outward appearance, if that serves a religious purpose such as calling them to Islam, or finding out about their true state of affairs in order to inform the Muslims of that, or warding off their harm from the Muslims, and other righteous goals.” (Iqtidaa’ al-Siraat al-Mustaqeem, p. 176). 
The words of Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah must be understood correctly. He is speaking of special circumstances or cases of necessity; he does not mean at all that Muslims should become assimilated with the kaafirs and do evil things or drink alcohol with them or that Muslim children should go to churches and lose their Islamic identity. Rather what is meant is that it is permissible to forego distinctive Islamic dress – for example – and wear clothing of the type prevalent in the kaafir country, and to speak the language of the kaafirs, etc., in order to ward off the harm of the kaafirs, especially in an atmosphere that is charged with hostility, such as that mentioned in the question. 
Perhaps these events will give the Muslims who are living in kaafir lands unnecessarily and for no shar’i purpose the opportunity to review their situation and consider going back to the Muslim world and making hijrah from the land of the kaafirs. 
We ask Allaah to protect us and all our Muslim brothers from harm, wrongdoing and evil, and guide us to the right path. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad and grant him peace.","Fatawa Islamiyyah, 2/401-411"

    was keeping it did not look after it properly. I wanted to buy it back and I 
    thought that he would give it to me for a cheap price. I asked the Prophet

Does it expiate for everything, even major sins? What is the reason for venerating this day?.","Fasting the day of ‘Ashoora’ does expiate for the past year. The expiation of sins that is achieved by fasting ‘Ashoora’ refers to minor sins; with regard to major sins, they need separate repentance.","Firstly: What is the reward of fasting 'Ashura?


Secondly: Why did the Prophet fast the day of 'Ashura?


Thirdly:  What are the sins that are expiated by fasting 'Ashura?","Praise be to Allah.Firstly: What is the reward of fasting 'Ashura?
Fasting the day of 'Ashura does expiate for the past year, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Fasting the day of ‘Arafah I hope Allah will expiate thereby for the year before it and the year after it, and fasting the day of 'Ashura I hope Allah will expiate thereby for the year that came before it.” Narrated by Muslim, 1162. This is by the bounty that Allah bestows upon us, whereby fasting one day expiates for the sins of a whole year. And Allah is the Owner of great bounty. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to be very keen to make sure he fasted on the day of 'Ashura because of its great status. It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I never saw the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) so keen to make sure he fasted any day and preferring it over another except this day, the day of 'Ashura, and this month – meaning Ramadaan. Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1867. 
What is meant by being keen to make sure he fasted it is so as to earn its reward. 
Secondly: Why did the Prophet fast the day of 'Ashura?
With regard to the reason why the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) fasted on the day of 'Ashura  and urged the people to do likewise is mentioned in the hadeeth narrated by al-Bukhaari (1865) from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came to Madeenah and saw the Jews fasting on the day of 'Ashura. He said, “What is this?” They said, “This is a good day, this is the day when Allah saved the Children of Israel from their enemy and Moosa fasted on this day.” He said, “We are closer to Moosa than you.” So he fasted on this day and told the people to fast. 
The words “this is a good day” – according to a version narrated by Muslim, “This is a great day when Allah saved Moosa and his people and drowned Pharaoh and his people.” 
The words “so Moosa fasted on this day” – Muslim added in his report: “In gratitude to Allah, so that is we fast on this day.” 
According to another version narrated by al-Bukhaari, “So we fast it out of respect for it.” 
The words “and told the people to fast” – according to another version narrated by al-Bukhaari, “He said to his companions, ‘You are closer to Moosa than them, so fast this day.” 
Thirdly:  What are the sins that are expiated by fasting 'Ashura?
The expiation of sins that is achieved by fasting 'Ashura refers to minor sins; with regard to major sins, they need separate repentance. 
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
Fasting the day of ‘Arafaah expiates for all minor sins, in othr words this brings forgiveness for all sins except for major sins. 
Then he said: 
Fasting the day of ‘Arafaah is an expiation for two years, and the day of ‘Ashoora is an expiation for one year, and if a person’s Ameen coincides with the Ameen of the angels, his previous sins will be forgiven… Each of the things mentioned may bring expiation. If he does something that expiates for minor sins he will be expiated, and if there are no minor or major sins, it will be recorded for him as good deeds and he will rise in status thereby… If there is one or more major sins and no minor sins, we hope that it will reduce his major sins.  Al-Majmoo’ Sharh al-Muhadhdhab, part 6. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The expiation of purification, prayer, and fasting Ramadaan, ‘Arafah and 'Ashura applies to minor sins only.  Al-Fataawa al-Kubra, part 5.

21784,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21784,The difference between erotic dreams and looking at women,"Erotic dreams increase desire, so what is the difference between erotic dreams and looking at non-mahram women via the TV?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Comparing these two things is intrinsically false, and whatever is built on a false basis is also false, and this is due to a number of things: 
Firstly: 
The word ihtilaam (translated here as erotic dream) refers to what a person sees in his sleep, which includes a man seeing images of intercourse and imagining the sexual act in his sleep. This is something natural which all men and women see. There is nothing wrong with it and there is no sin on a person because of that. It was narrated in the hadith of Umm Sulaym that she asked the Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about a woman who sees in her dream what a man sees. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If a woman sees that she should do ghusl.” (Narrated by Muslim, al-Hayd, 469) 
Secondly: 
Erotic dreams are beyond a person’s control and he has no power to prevent them. Rather is a means of the body ridding itself of excess material that may harm it if it remains in the body. Hence sometimes a person may see something in his sleep, and sometimes he may not see anything but still experience nocturnal emissions. Hence it is not haraam. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope. He gets reward for that (good) which he has earned” [Al-Baqarah 2:286]
With regard to masturbation, it is haraam because it happens by a person’s intention and will. See the answer to question 329 . 
The same applies to looking at women, because this happens by a person’s choice and intention, and he does it deliberately. Hence it is not allowed. 
Because a person is unable to prevent a sudden glance, he will not be brought to account for that, rather the sin is in following it with another glance. It says in the hadith: “O ‘Ali, do not follow one glance with another, for you are allowed the first but not the second.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, al-Adab, 2701; classed as hasan by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, no. 2229). What is meant by “you are allowed the first” is if that does not happen intentionally, and “but not the second” means because it is done by your own choice, so it is a sin on you. 
Thirdly: 
Allah has commanded the believers to lower their gaze. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts)” [Al-Noor 24:30]
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) also commanded likewise. It was narrated that Jareer said: “I asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about a sudden look. He said, ‘Avert your gaze.’” (Narrated by Abu Dawood, al-Nikaah, 1836; classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, no. 1880. Hence it is obligatory to obey the command of Allah and His Messenger. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And let those who oppose the Messenger’s (Muhammad’s) commandment (i.e. his Sunnah legal ways, orders, acts of worship, statements) (among the sects) beware, lest some Fitnah (disbelief, trials, afflictions, earthquakes, killing, overpowered by a tyrant) should befall them or a painful torment be inflicted on them” [Al-Noor 24:63]
What people should know and believe is that Allah does not burden people with things that are too difficult for them or impose hardship upon them. He does not enjoin any impossible commands. This includes lowering the gaze, for it is within a person’s reach to obey this command. 
But because the way to Paradise is lined with difficult things and the way to Hell is lined with whims and desires, Allah has made this a test and a trial for His slaves. So whoever obeys the command of Allah and keeps away from that which Allah has forbidden, the consequences will be good for him and he will have a good Hereafter. And the converse also applies (i.e., one who goes against Allah’s commands will have bad consequences).
 Fourthly: 
Allah has commanded us to lower our gaze and has forbidden us to look at women because of the great evil and mischief that result from that. For looking is the harbinger of zina (unlawful sexual relationships) – Allah forbid. Hence it says in the hadith that Allah has decreed for the son of Adam his share of zina, which will inevitably catch up with him, and the zina of the eyes is looking, the zina of the tongue is speaking; the heart wishes and hopes and the private parts confirm that or deny it.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, al-Qadar, 6122). So if a person lowers his gaze and refrains from looking at that which Allah has forbidden, how could he be motivated to commit immoral actions? What the Muslim must do is to keep away from everything that may lead to immorality, whether that is looking at women, or thinking thoughts that provoke and increase desire. Whoever does those things will only make more worry and distress for himself, to no avail.
 As the poet said:
 “If you let your gaze wander, this will cause you a lot of heartache.
You will see things that you will desire but you are unable to acquire them, yet you are unable to bear that with patience.”
 “How many looks have been fatal to the heart of the one who looked,
as fatal as an arrow, but with no bow and no string.”
 And it was said that being patient in lowering one's gaze is easier than trying to put up with the pain that comes afterwards.
 We ask Allah to guide us all. And Allah knows best. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.",Islam Q&A
21785,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21785,Is It Recommended  to Fast on the 9th of 'Ashura with the 10th?,"I want to fast 'Ashura this year, but some people told me that the Sunnah is to fast the day before as well (Taasoo’a’). Is there any report that this was the teaching of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)?",It is recommended to fast both the ninth and the tenth of 'Ashura because the Prophet (peace be upon him) fasted the tenth and intended to fast the ninth.,"It is recommended to fast on the 9th of 'Ashura with the 10th 


The wisdom of fasting the 9th of 'Ashura with the 10th","Praise be to Allah.It is recommended to fast on the 9th of 'Ashura with the 10th 

‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: When the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) fasted on the day of ‘Ashoora and told the people to fast, they said, “O Messenger of Allaah, this is a day that is venerated by the Jews and Christians.” The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Next year, if Allaah wills, we will fast on the ninth day.” But by the time the following year came, the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had passed away.  Narrated by Muslim, 1916. 
Al-Shaafa’i and his companions, Ahmad, Ishaaq and others said: It is mustahabb [recommended] to fast both the ninth and the tenth, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) fasted the tenth and intended to fast the ninth. 
The wisdom of fasting the 9th of 'Ashura with the 10th
Based on this, there are different ways of fasting 'Ashura, the least of which is to fast the tenth only, but it is better to fast the ninth as well. The more one fasts in Muharram, the better. 
If one were to ask, what is the wisdom behind fasting the ninth as well as the tenth? The answer is: 
Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The scholars among our companions and others said that there are several reasons for recommending fasting on the ninth day (Tasoo’a’): 
1 – The intention behind it is to be different from the Jews who limit their fasting to the tenth day. This was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas. 
2 – The intention was to join the fast of 'Ashura to another day, just as it is not allowed to fast on a Friday on its own [but it is allowed if one fasts the day before or the day after as well]. 
3 – The idea is to be on the safe side and make sure one is fasting on the tenth, in case the moon sighting was not accurate and what people think is the ninth is actually the tenth. 
The strongest of these reasons is in order to be different from the People of the Book. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade resembling the People of the Book in many ahaadeeth. For example, he said concerning 'Ashura: “If I live until next year I will certainly fast the ninth.” Al-Fataawa al-Kubra, part 6. 
Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, commenting on the hadeeth “If I live until next year I will certainly fast the ninth”: 
His concern to fast the ninth may be understood as meaning that he would not limit himself to that, rather that he would add it to the tenth, either to be on the safe side, or to be different from the Jews and Christians, which is more likely to be correct; this is what may be understood from some of the reports narrated by Muslim.” From Fath al-Baari, 4/245.

21793,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21793,Was al-Khidr a Prophet?,"Was al-Khidr an angel, a Messenger, a Prophet or a wali (“saint”)?","From the general meaning of the Quranic verses “Then they found one of Our slaves, on whom We had bestowed mercy from Us, and whom We had taught knowledge from Us” [al-Kahf 18:65], it appears that Al-Khidr was a prophet.",,"Praise be to Allah.From the general meaning of the Quranic verses, it appears that Al-Khidr was a prophet. 
Shaykh al-Shanqiti (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on the verse (interpretation of the meaning):
“Then they found one of Our slaves, on whom We had bestowed mercy from Us, and whom We had taught knowledge from Us” [al-Kahf 18:65]
“But it may be understood from some verses that the mercy mentioned here was the mercy of prophethood, and that this knowledge which came from Allah was the knowledge of revelation. It is known that mercy and the bestowal of knowledge from Allah is more general and comes in more ways than via prophethood. The fact that something general exists does not necessarily imply that something more specific exists, as is well known. One of the indications that the mercy and knowledge with which Allah blessed His slave al-Khidr came by way of prophethood and revelation is the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And I did them not of my own accord” [al-Kahf 18:82] i.e., rather I did them by the command of Allah, and the command of Allah is only conveyed via revelation, because there is no way for the commands and prohibitions of Allah to be known except through revelation from Allah, especially with regard to the killing of an apparently innocent soul and damaging a ship by making a hole in it, because committing acts of aggression against people’s lives and wealth can only be validated via revelation from Allah. 
Allah has restricted the method of warning to revelation as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say (O Muhammad): “I warn you only by the Revelation” [al-Anbiya 21:45] 
The word innama (translated here as “only”) implies limitation or restriction.” (Adwa al-Bayan, 4/172, 173)
And he said: 
“From all of this, we know that al-Khidr’s killing the boy and making a hole in the ship, and his saying, 
“And I did them not of my own accord” [al-Kahf 18:82 – interpretation of the meaning] clearly indicates that he was a Prophet. Al-Fakhr al-Razi, in his tafsir, attributed the view that he was a prophet to many scholars. Another factor that may indicate that he was a prophet is the fact that Musa (peace be upon him) humbled himself before him and said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“May I follow you so that you teach me something of that knowledge (guidance and true path) which you have been taught (by Allah)?” [al-Kahf 18:66] 
“If Allah wills, you will find me patient, and I will not disobey you in aught” [al-Kahf 18:69] even though al-Khidr said to him (interpretation of the meaning):
