I am disposed that it was either very little vomiting /i.e. I was not able to keep my water down/ or some spitting.

If you cannot help vomiting and vomit involuntarily, your fast is still valid and you do not have to do anything else.","What is vomiting?

Vomiting a little while fasting


Does spitting break your fast?","Praise be to Allah.What is vomiting?
Vomiting refers to when food, etc. is expelled from the stomach outside the body.  
Does vomiting break your fast?
With regard to whether vomiting breaks the fast or not, the ruling depends on whether it was done deliberately or not . If a person vomits deliberately, this breaks the fast and he has to make up that day. If he cannot help vomiting and vomits involuntarily, then his fast is still valid and he does not have to do anything else. 
If a person needs to vomit because he is sick and vomiting will help him to recover, then it is permissible for him to do that, but he has to make up that day after Ramadan, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number [of days which one did not observe Sawm (fasts) must be made up] from other days.” [al-Baqarah 2:185]
Vomiting a little while fasting
According to the correct scholarly view, it makes no difference whether the amount of vomit is great or small. If a person vomits deliberately and only a small amount comes out, the fast is broken. 
It says in al-Furu’: 
“If a person makes himself vomit and vomits anything, then his fast is broken, because of the report of Abu Hurayrah: “Whoever cannot help vomiting does not have to do anything but whoever makes himself vomit deliberately has to make up that day.” (Al-Furu’, 3/49) This hadith was narrated by Abu Dawud, 2380; al-Tirmidhi, 720 – he said the scholars follow this. It was classed as sahih by al-Albani. 
Does spitting break your fast?
But there is a difference between spitting and vomiting. Spitting and hawking, etc. do not come from the stomach, so there is nothing wrong with expelling that matter. But vomiting comes from the stomach as explained above.

38206,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/38206,Can You Chew Gum while Fasting?,I’ve found that the ruling for chewing gum in Ramadan is that it is not permissible. I would like to know how this conclusion came about and all the alternatives I could use if chewing gum is indeed haram during the month of Ramadan.,"Chewing gum which contains sugar and artificial flavorings breaks your fast. But if the gum does not contain any substance that will dissolve and enter the stomach, then it does not break the fast.","Does chewing gum break your fast? 


How to remove the smell of bad breath in Ramadan","Praise be to Allah.Does chewing gum break your fast? 
It seems that the questioner is referring to the kind of chewing gum which is well known nowadays, which is a rubbery substance that usually contains sugar and artificial flavorings. Chewing this kind of gum leads to breaking the fast, because the sugars and flavorings dissolve in the saliva and enter the stomach. 
Undoubtedly this breaks one’s fast, because nutrients enter the stomach. But if the gum does not contain any substance that will dissolve and enter the stomach, then it does not break the fast. 
How to remove the smell of bad breath in Ramadan 
With regard to alternatives to chewing gum, if what is meant is something that may be used to improve the smell of the mouth, then the Muslim should use siwak , because it is one of the Sunnahs narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
You may also rinse your mouth so as to remove the smell , or use toothpaste, subject to the condition that nothing of it reaches your stomach. If you fear that some of it may reach your stomach then you should not use it. 
You should also note that this smell that comes out of the mouth because the stomach is empty and which may disturb a person, cannot be removed with the siwak , etc. because it comes from the stomach due to fasting. It is better before Allah than the fragrance of musk. It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The smell of the fasting person’s mouth is better before Allah than the fragrance of musk.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5583; Muslim, 1151)

38213,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/38213,Are hasanaat and sayi’aat multiplied at special times and in special places?,Is it true that sayi’aat (bad deeds) are multiplied in Ramadan? Is the same true of hasanaat (good deeds)? Is there any evidence to that effect?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Yes, both hasanaat and sayi’aat are multiplied at special times and in special places, but there is a difference between the multiplication of hasanaat and the multiplication of sayi’aat. The multiplication of hasanaat is in both quantity and quality. What is meant by quantity is number, so a good deed is multiplied by ten times the like thereof; and what is meant by quality is that the reward is great and vast. With regard to sayi’aat, it is multiplied in terms of quality only, i.e., the sin is greater and the punishment is more severe. With regard to quantity a bad deed receives one sayi’ah, and it cannot be more than one. 
It says in Mataalib Uli al-Nuha (2/385): 
“Hasanaat and sayi’aat are multiplied in a special place such as Makkah, Madeenah and Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem), and in the mosques; and at special times such as on Fridays, during the sacred months and in Ramadan. With regard to the multiplication of hasanaat, this is a matter concerning which there is no scholarly difference of opinion. With regard to the multiplication of sayi’aat, this was the view of a number of scholars, following Ibn ‘Abbas and Ibn Mas’ood… Some scholars said that what Ibn ‘Abbas and Ibn Mas’ood meant by the view on the multiplication of sayi’aat is that they are multiplied in quality but not in quantity.”
Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Does fasting bring the Muslim expiation for both minor and major sins? Is the sin of an evil action compounded in Ramadan?” 
He replied: “What is prescribed for the Muslim in Ramadan and at other times is to strive against his nafs (self) that is inclined towards evil until it becomes tranquil and inclined towards goodness. He must fight against the enemy of Allah Iblees until he is safe from his evil and his whispers. The Muslim in this world is engaged in a great, ongoing struggle against his nafs, his desires and the Shaytaan. So he has to repent a great deal and pray for forgiveness at all times. But times vary one from another. The month of Ramadan is the best month of the year, for it is the month of forgiveness, mercy and ransom from the Fire. If the month is special and the place is special, the hasanaat for good deeds are multiplied and the sayi’aat for sins are multiplied. An evil deed done in Ramadan is more sinful than one done at any other time, just as an act of worship done in Ramadan brings a greater reward from Allah than one done at any other time. Because Ramadan has such a great status, an act of worship done during this month is especially virtuous and its reward is greatly multiplied, and a sin committed during this month is worse and more serious than a sin committed at any other time. So the Muslim has to make the most of this blessed month by doing acts of worship and righteous deeds, and giving up bad deeds, so that Allah may bless him by accepting his good deeds and helping to remain steadfast in adhering to the truth. But a bad deed receives one sayi’ah like it, and is not multiplied in terms of quantity either in Ramadan or at other times. But a good deed may be multiplied ten or more times, because Allah says in Soorat al-An’aam (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Whoever brings a good deed (Islamic Monotheism and deeds of obedience to Allah and His Messenger) shall have ten times the like thereof to his credit, and whoever brings an evil deed (polytheism, disbelief, hypocrisy, and deeds of disobedience to Allah and His Messenger) shall have only the recompense of the like thereof, and they will not be wronged” [al-An’aam 6:160] 
And there are many similar verses. 
Similarly in special places such as the Haramayn [the Two Sanctuaries, i.e., in Makkah and Madeenah] deeds are multiplied greatly in quantity and quality; bad deeds are not multiplied in quantity but they are multiplied in quality when done at special times or in special places, as referred to above. And Allah is the Source of strength. 
From Majmoo’ Fatawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah, 15/446. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 7/262: 
Both hasanaat and sayi’aat are multiplied when done in special places and at special times.  
Hasanaat (good deeds) are multiplied in quantity and quality; sayi’aat (bad deeds) are multiplied in quality but not in quantity, because Allah says in Soorat al-An’aam, which was revealed in Makkah, (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Whoever brings a good deed (Islamic Monotheism and deeds of obedience to Allah and His Messenger) shall have ten times the like thereof to his credit, and whoever brings an evil deed (polytheism, disbelief, hypocrisy, and deeds of disobedience to Allah and His Messenger) shall have only the recompense of the like thereof, and they will not be wronged”
[al-An’aam 6:160] 
And He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“… and whoever inclines to evil actions therein [i.e., in al-Masjid al-Haraam in Makkah] or to do wrong (i.e. practise polytheism and leave Islamic Monotheism), him We shall cause to taste from a painful torment”
[al-Hajj 22:25] 
But He did not say, We will multiply that to him, rather He said, “We shall cause to taste from a painful torment”. So the way in which sayi’aat done in Makkah or in Madeenah are multiplied is in terms of quality.

Is it permissible to pray Witr like Maghrib?","Praise be to Allah.How Prophet Muhammad prayed witr?
It was proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed Witr in different ways . He prayed one rak`ah, and three, and five, and seven, and nine. And he prayed three rak`ahs in two different ways, either continuously with one tashahhud, or saying salam after two rak`ahs and praying one rak`ah and saying salam after it. 
Is it permissible to pray Witr like Maghrib?
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not pray it like Maghrib , with two tashahhuds and one salam. Rather he forbade doing that, and said: “Do not pray Witr with three rak`ahs like Maghrib .” (Narrated by al-Hakim, 1/403; al-Bayhaqi, 3/31; al-Daraqutni, p. 172)
Al-Hafiz ibn Hajar said in Fath al-Bari (4/301): “Its isnad fulfils the conditions of the two Shaykhs (al-Bukhari and Muslim).” 
Shaykh Muhammad al-Salih al-‘Uthaymin said: 
It is permissible to pray Witr with three rak`ahs, or with five, or with seven, or with nine. If a person prays Witr with three, it may be done in one of two ways, both of which are prescribed in the Shari`ah: 

Praying the three rak'ahs continually with one tashahhud.
Saying salam after two rak`ahs, then praying one rak`ah on its own. 

Both of these are narrated in the Sunnah, so if a person does it one way sometimes and the other way sometimes, that is good. 
…It is permissible to say Witr with one salam, but it should be with only one tashahhud and not two, because if he does it with two tashahhuds, it will be like Maghrib prayer , and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade making it like Maghrib prayer.” (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 4/14-16)

I wanted to know what hes doing is haram or it holds nothing against him by Islam and allah?when he sees me out he laughs at my pain please answer I would greatly appreciate it cause i feel i am hopeless.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    You should praise Allaah for having guided you and brought 
    you back to Him. You have to observe the fasts that Allaah has enjoined upon 
    you, even if your father dislikes that, because there is no obedience to any 
    created being if it involves disobedience towards the Creator. 

    Secondly: 

    You say that you feel ill and that you suffer from anaemia 
    and allergies. In that case you have to refer to a trustworthy doctor and 
    ask him whether fasting is harmful for you or not, and whether there is any 
    hope of a recovery from this disease or not. If fasting will harm you 
    because of this sickness, or will make the sickness worse, or delay 
    recovery, or make it very hard for you to fast, then Allaah has made things 
    easy for you and has allowed you not to fast. So you should not fast, and 
    you should make up the days that you do not fast after you recover, in sha 
    Allaah. 

    But if this sickness is ongoing and there is no hope of 
    making up the fasts, then do not fast, and you have to feed one poor person 
    for each day that you do not fast. See question no.
    12488. 

    Thirdly: 

    The father has to look after his family properly, and tell 
    them to do what is enjoined upon them and not to do that which is forbidden. 
    If he falls short in that then he is exposed to divine wrath and punishment. 
    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Ward 
    off yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and 
    stones, over which are (appointed) angels stern (and) severe, who disobey 
    not, (from executing) the Commands they receive from Allaah, but do that 
    which they are commanded”

    [al-Tahraam 66:6]

    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said: “There is no person whom Allaah appoints in charge of others and he 
    dies having betrayed his charges, but Allaah will forbid Paradise to him.” 
    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6731; Muslim, 142. 

    And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said: “Each of you is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock… The 
    man is the shepherd of his family and is responsible for his flock…” 
    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 844; Muslim, 3408. Each person who was in a 
    position of authority and responsibility – including fathers – will be 
    questioned as to whether he did what was required of him, or not? 

    It is well known that blessings and reward will result from 
    this questioning, if he did what was required of him, and that he will 
    deserve to be punished if he was careless and negligent. We ask Allaah to 
    keep us safe and sound. 

    If the father’s negligence is compounded by his having 
    forbidden his family to do good things or things that are obligatory, then 
    his sin will be even greater. Allaah has told us that this is the 
    characteristic of the hypocrites and evildoers, who enjoin evil and forbid 
    good. He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The hypocrites, men and 
    women, are one from another; they enjoin (on the people) Al-Munkar (i.e. 
    disbelief and polytheism of all kinds and all that Islam has forbidden), and 
    forbid (people) from Al-Ma‘roof (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam 
    orders one to do), and they close their hands [from giving (spending in 
    Allaah’s Cause) alms]. They have forgotten Allaah, so He has forgotten them. 
    Verily, the hypocrites are the Faasiqoon (rebellious, disobedient to 
    Allaah)”

    [al-Tawbah 9:67]

    You have to be patient and seek reward, and continue to 
    advise your father. Seek the help of righteous people among your family and 
    relatives in doing so, and pray for him to be guided aright. 

    You should beware of staying outside the home when there is 
    no need, because of the harm and fitnah (temptation) that may result from 
    that. If you need to go out, or are forced to do so, then you should observe 
    correct shar’i hijaab. In question no.

    find out the conditions of correct shar’i hijaab.

    right way.

You could choose some days to have iftar with your family and some days to have iftar in the mosque with the congregation.,,"Praise be to Allah.If what the questioner is referring to is food that is eaten to distinguish between the time of fasting and the time when it is permissible to eat, such as eating dates and drinking water and so on, then it is mustahabb to hasten to do that .
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The people will continue to be fine so long as they hasten to break the fast .” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1957; Muslim, 1098) 
But if what is meant is what people eat after praying (the iftar meal ), then there is nothing narrated concerning that in the Sunnah as far as I know, but each person must weigh up different factors. 
Eating iftar in the mosque with the congregation serves the interest of bringing Muslims together and helping them get to know one another and become friends, reviving the spirit of cooperation and so on. 
Eating iftar with the family at home serves the interest of bringing the family together, discussing family matters, reinforcing the bonds between family members, teaching children the etiquette of eating and conversing, and so on; it increases the love between husband and wife, and between parents and children, and so on. 
What the head of the household must do is strike a balance between these interests. He could choose some days to eat iftar with his family and some days to eat iftar with the congregation in the mosque, whilst noting that his duty to take care of his family and children, teaching them the etiquette and teachings of Islam takes precedence over the nafl action of meeting with friends in the mosque, because he can meet them at Tarawih prayers or in a general gathering and so on.

It is preferable to delay `Isha’ prayer so long as that does not cause any hardship to the people, because Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Were it not that it would be too hard for my Ummah, I would have commanded them to delay `Isha’ until one-third of the night had passed, or one half.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 167)
This Hadith indicates that it is recommended to delay `Isha’ so long as that does not cause hardship to the members of the congregation. If it will cause hardship to them, then the prayer should be brought forward. 
`Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stayed late one night until most of the night had gone and the people in the mosque had fallen asleep, then he went out and prayed. He said, “This would be its time, were it not that this would be difficult for my ummah.” (Narrated by Muslim, 638) 
Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) said, when he mentioned the times when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed: “He sometimes delayed `Isha’, and sometimes brought it forward if he saw that they had gathered early. But if he saw that they were coming late, he would delay it.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1/141; Muslim, 646. See Ma`rifat Awqat Al-`Ibadat by Dr. Khalid Al-Mushayqih, 1/291) 
In some countries, the people are accustomed to delaying `Isha’ for half an hour or so after the time for it begins, so that people can break their fast at leisure and get ready to pray `Isha’ and Tarawih. 
There is nothing wrong with delaying `Isha’ prayer, on condition that the Imam does not delay the prayer so much that he causes hardship to the members of the congregation, as mentioned above. 
It is better to refer to the people who attend the mosque and reach an agreement with them on the time for the prayer, because they know best what suits them.

38287,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/38287,A trick to have intercourse during the day in Ramadaan by breaking the fast beforehand,I had been to my home country on a week leave. One day before flying off i had called my wife and had advised my wife not to fast on the day of my coming. This was because I am an impatient type of nature and wanted to have intercourse with the wife at the moment i reached home. she obeyed my words and we had sex during the day. Both were not fasting. Have we commited a sin?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.If what happened to you took place in a month other than Ramadaan, there is no sin on you, because naafil fasts do not have to be completed; even if a Muslim has started such a fast, he may stop the fast, according to the sound scholarly view. 
But if it happened in the month of Ramadaan, it is a major sin. How can anyone take lightly the matter of stopping the fast without a valid excuse or shar’i reason, and even use trickery to transgress the sacred limits of Allaah in this manner? 
Based on that, if that happened in the month of Ramadaan, it is subject to further discussion: 
1 – If you arrived before the adhaan of Fajr, then you should have fasted that day, so long as your journey ended when you returned to your home. If you deliberately did not fast, and your wife broke the fast with you, so that you could have intercourse with her, then you are both sinners and you both have to make up the fast and you both have to offer the severe expiation that is required for intercourse. 
2 – If you arrived during the day, the correct view is that if the traveller arrives not fasting, he does not have to refrain from eating and drinking for the rest of the day, because he cannot be required both to refrain and to make up the day. This view was narrated from Imam Ahmad, and it is the view of the Shaafa’is. [See Sharh al-Mushayqih ‘ala Zaad al-Ma’aad, 4/282-285.] But you sinned by telling her to break the fast, and she also sinned if she obeyed you. If she did not fast so that you could have intercourse with her, then she has to make up that day, and she alone has to offer the severe expiation because of the intercourse that took place. This has already been discussed in questions no. 38023, 22938 and 1672. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about a man who wanted to have intercourse with his wife during the day in Ramadaan, and he broke his fast with food before having intercourse, then he had intercourse. Does he have to offer expiation or not? What about the one who breaks the fast with no excuse? 
He replied: Praise be to Allaah. There are two well-known scholarly views concerning this matter. The first is that it is obligatory. This is the view of the majority, such as Maalik, Ahmad, Abu Haneefah and others. The second view is that it is not obligatory. This is the view of al-Shaafa’i… Then they disputed as to whether it is essential that he would have broken a valid fast (in order for the severe expiation to be required). Al-Shaafa’i and others said that that is essential, for example if he eats and then has intercourse, or he starts the day intending not to fast and then has intercourse, or he has intercourse, then offers expiation, then has intercourse again. He does not have to offer expiation, according to al-Shaafa’i, because he did not have intercourse during a valid fast. But Ahmad and others say that he does have to offer expiation in these and similar cases, because he should have refrained from eating etc during Ramadaan, so this is an invalid fast. This is like invalid ihraam. If a pilgrim who has entered ihraam for Hajj spoils his ihraam, he has to continue refraining from the things that are forbidden during ihraam, like those whose ihraam is still valid. Similarly, if a person is obliged to fast during Ramadaan, he has to refrain even if his fast is spoiled by eating or having intercourse, or by not having the intention to fast. He should still refrain from doing the things that are forbidden when fasting. But if he does not refrain, he is still subject to the same requirement of expiation as if his fast was still valid. And in either case he has to make up the fast as well. 
And Allaah knows best.
