4804,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4804,Should he send blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when he makes du’aa’ in his sujood?,"I know that one of the requisites of making Du'a is sending prayers on the Prophet Muhammad (S) and the Du'a is blocked from the heavens until one sends prayers on him (S). Is this is general ruling? What is one wants of make Du'a during sujood (prostration), does one send prayers on the Prophet during that posture as well?",,,"Praise be to Allah.According to Islamic teaching, du’aa’ (supplication) 
          may be divided into two categories, general and specific.
 General du’aa’ is that which may be 
          initiated by the individual, in which he may say whatever he wants, 
          at certain times or in certain places prescribed by sharee’ah, such 
          as making du’aa’ in the last third of the night, or making du’aa’ between 
          the adhaan (call to prayer) and iqaamah (second call immediately preceding 
          the prayer), or making du’aa’ at ‘Arafaah, and so on.
 The specific kind of du’aa’ is du’aa’s 
          which are said when entering or leaving a place, when certain things 
          happen, and so on, such as when entering and leaving the toilet, when 
          the wind blows strongly, and so on.
 The first kind, general du’aa’s, are 
          those in which blessings should be sent upon the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). They should also include 
          praise of Allaah. Faddaalah ibn ‘Ubayd said: “The Messenger of Allaah 
           (peace and blessings of Allaah 
          be upon him) heard a man making du’aa’ in his prayer, but he did not 
          praise Allaah or send blessings on the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). The Messenger of Allaah 
           (peace and blessings of Allaah 
          be upon him) said: ‘This man is in a hurry.’ Then he called him or someone 
          else and said, ‘When any one of you prays, let him begin by praising 
          his Lord, then let him send blessings on the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), then let him pray for whatever 
          he wants after that.’”
(Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3477, and Abu Dawood, 1481)  
          
The context of sending blessings on the Prophet 
           (peace and blessings of Allaah 
          be upon him) was mentioned by the great scholar Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah 
          have mercy on him), who said:
“Blessings should be sent upon him before supplication 
          and after praising Allaah.
The second place is to send blessings upon him at the 
          beginning of the du’aa’, in the middle and at the end.
The third place is to send blessings upon him at the 
          beginning and at the end, and to mention one’s need in the middle.”
(Jalaa’ al-Afhaam, 
          p. 375)  
With regard to the reason for sending blessing 
          upon the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
          of Allaah be upon him) in du’aa’, Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may 
          Allaah have mercy on him) said:
“Sending blessings upon him is one of the greatest means 
          of having du’aa’s answered, and this has been enjoined by Allaah. Sending 
          blessings upon him in du’aa’ is what is indicated by the Qur’aan, Sunnah 
          and ijmaa’ (scholarly consensus). Allaah says (interpretation of the 
          meaning);
‘Allaah 
          sends His Salaah (Graces, Honours, Blessings, Mercy) on the Prophet 
          (Muhammad), and also His angels (ask Allaah to bless and forgive him). 
          O you who believe! Send your Salaah on (ask Allaah to bless) him (Muhammad), 
          and (you should) greet (salute) him with the Islamic way of greeting 
          (salutation, i.e. As‑Salaamu ‘Alaikum)’ 
[al-Ahzaab 33:56].”
(Majmoo al-Fataawa, 
          1/347) 
 Ibn al-Qayyim said:
In these contexts in which it is prescribed to send blessing 
          upon the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
          of Allaah be upon him), it is prescribed to send blessings upon the 
          Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
          Allaah be upon him) before starting the du’aa’. The key to du’aa’ is 
          sending blessings upon the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), just as the key to salaah 
          (prayer) is purity. So may Allaah send blessings and peace upon him 
          and his family.  
With regard to the specific kind of du’aa’s mentioned 
          above, these do not include sending blessings upon the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), except in a few cases such 
          as the du’aa’ for entering the mosque and the du’aa’ after the adhaan, 
          as will be quoted below.  
The Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) taught his ummah 
          specific du’aa’s for certain times and certain actions, in which there 
          is no sending blessings on the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). These include:
Du’aa’ 
          al-istikhaarah:
 It was narrated that Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah 
          (may Allaah be pleased with them both) said: The Messenger of Allaah 
           (peace and blessings of Allaah 
          be upon him) taught us to pray for guidance in all our affairs, just 
          as he would teach us a soorah from the Qur’aan. He said: “If any of 
          you intends to undertake a matter, then let him pray two non-obligatory 
          rak’ahs, then let him say:
‘Allaahumma inni astakheeruka 
          bi ‘ilmika wa astaqdiruka bi qudratika, wa as’aluka min fadlik al-‘azeem 
          fa innaka taqdiru wa laa aqdir, wa ta’lamu wa laa a’lam, wa anta ‘allaam 
          ul-ghuyoobi. Allaahumma in kunta ta’lamu anna haadha’l-amra 
          – and here he mentions his need – khayrun 
          li fi deeni wa ma’aashi wa ‘aaqibati amri (or he said, ‘aajil amri wa aajilihi), faqdirhu 
          li wa yassirhu li thumma baarik li fihi. Wa in kunta ta’lam anna hadha’l-amra 
          sharrun li fi deeni wa ma’aashi wa ‘aaqbiti amri (or he said, 
          ‘aajil amri wa aajilihi), 
          fasrifhu ‘anni wasrifni ‘anhu waqdir 
          li al-khayr haythu kaana thumma ardini bihi
(O Allaah, 
          I seek Your guidance by Your knowledge and I seek strength by Your power. 
          I ask you of Your great Bounty. You have power, I have none, You know, 
          I know not. You are the Knower of the Unseen. O Allaah, if You know 
          that this matter – and here he should mention it – is good for me in 
          my religious commitment, my livelihood and my affairs (or he said, immediately 
          and in the distant future), then decree it for me, make it easy for 
          me and bless it for me. And if you know that this matter is bad for 
          me in my religious commitment, my livelihood and my affairs (or he said, 
          immediately and in the distant future), then turn it away from me, and 
          turn me away from it, and decree for me whatever is good, wherever it 
          may be, and make me content with it).’”
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1113) Du’aa’ when entering 
          the toilet:
 It was narrated that Anas ibn Maalik 
          (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “Whenever he entered the toilet, 
          the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
          of Allaah be upon him) used to say, ‘Allaahumma 
          inni a’oodhu bika min al-khubthi wa’l-khabaa’ith (O Allaah, 
          I seek refuge with You from all evil and evildoers).”
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5963; Muslim, 375) 
Du’aa’ when there are high winds:
 It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah, the 
          wife of the Prophet  (peace and 
          blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whenever there was a wind-storm, 
          the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
          of Allaah be upon him) would say, “Allaahumma 
          inni as’aluka khayrahaa wa khayra ma fihaa wa khayra maa ursilat bihi, 
          wa a’oodhu bika min sharrihaa wa sharri maa fihaa wa sharri ma ursilat 
          bihi (O Allaah, I ask You for its goodness, the goodness 
          within it and the good with which it was sent, and I seek refuge with 
          You from its evil, the evil within it and the evil with which it was 
          sent.”
 And there are other du’aa’s which he 
          taught us, in which there is no mention of sending blessings upon him, 
           (peace and blessings of Allaah 
          be upon him). We should recite them as he has taught them to us, without 
          adding anything or taking anything away. This ruling also applies to 
          making du’aa’ in sujood, which is mentioned in the question. Several 
          du’aa’s have been reported that the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said in his sujood, none 
          of which contain blessings upon the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). These du’aa’s include the 
          following:
 It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may 
          Allaah be pleased with her) said: “The Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) often used to say in his 
          sujood and rukoo’: ‘Subhaanaka Allaahumma 
          Rabbanaa wa bi hamdika, Allaahumma ighfir li (Glory and praise 
          be to You, O Allaah our Lord; O Allaah, forgive me).’” (Narrated 
          by al-Bukhaari, 874; Muslim, 484). 
And it was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah said: “one 
          night I noticed that the Messenger of Allaah  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was not in his bed, so I 
          reached out looking for him, and my hand touched the soles of his feet; 
          he was in his prayer place and his feet were upright (i.e., he was prostrating), 
          and he was saying, ‘Allaahumma a’oodhu 
          bi ridaaka min sakhatika wa bi mu’aafaatika min ‘aqoobatika wa a’oodhi 
          bika minka laa uhsi thanaa’an ‘alayka anta kamaa athnayta ‘ala nafsika 
          (O Allaah, I seek refuge in Your good pleasure from Your wrath, and 
          I seek refuge in Your pardon from Your punishment. I seek refuge in 
          You from You. I cannot enumerate Your praise, You are as You have praised 
          Yourself).’”
(Narrated by Muslim, 486) 
Let us not forget also that the person who 
          is praying will recite al-salaah 
          al-Ibraaheemiyyah when he sits to recite the Tashahhud in 
          his prayer; thus his prayer will include sending blessings upon the 
          Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
          Allaah be upon him).
The specific du’aa’s which include sending 
          blessings upon the Prophet  (peace 
          and blessings of Allaah be upon him) include the following:
-Du’aa’ when entering the mosque:
It was narrated that Abu Humayd and Abu Usayd 
          said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace 
          and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When any one of you enters 
          the mosque, let him greet the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with peace, then let him 
          say, ‘Allaahumma aftah li abwaab rahmatika (O Allaah, open to me 
          the gates of Your Mercy).’ And when he leaves, let him say, ‘Allaahumma 
          inni as’aluka min fadlika (O Allaah, I ask You of Your Bounty).’”
(Narrated by Abu Dawood, 466). 
(This hadeeth was classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani 
          (may Allaah have mercy on him) in Tamaam 
          al-Minnah, p. 290) 
Du’aa’ 
          following the adhaan:
 It was narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn’Amr 
          ibn al-‘Aas heard the Prophet  (peace 
          and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “When you hear the muezzin, 
          say what he says, then send blessings upon me, for whoever sends blessings 
          upon me, Allaah will send ten blessings upon him. Then ask Allaah to 
          grant me al-waseelah, 
          which is a position in Paradise which will only be attained by one of 
          the slaves of Allaah, and I hope that I will be the one. Whoever asks 
          for al-waseelah for me, 
          my intercession will be granted for him.”

4811,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/4811,So let man see from what he is created,Did Allaah create man from clay or from something else that is not fully described in the Qur’aan?,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    Allaah created Adam (peace be upon him) from the earth i.e., 
    from what it contains. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Thereof (the earth) We created you, and into it We shall 
    return you, and from it We shall bring you out once again”

    [Ta-Ha 20:55]

    He created him from the dust of the earth, as He says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Verily, the likeness of ‘Eesa (Jesus) before Allaah is 
    the likeness of Adam. He created him from dust…”

    [Aal ‘Imraan 3:59]

    There are many similar verses in the Qur’aan. 

    Then the dust was combined with water to form clay, as the 
    Lord of the Worlds says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “He it is Who has created you from clay, and then has 
    decreed a (stated) term (for you to die). And there is with Him another 
    determined term (for you to be resurrected)”

    [al-An’aam 6:2]

    There are also many similar verses. 

    This clay was sticky – or it was said, viscous – as it says 
    in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Verily, We created them of a sticky clay”

    [al-Saaffaat 37:11]
Ibn Manzoor said: the words laazib (sticky) comes 
    from the root lazuba which has the meaning of becoming sticky and solid.  

    Lisaan al-‘Arab, 1/738 

    Then this sticky clay became muntin (stinking). Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And indeed, We created man from dried (sounding) clay of 
    altered mud [min hama’in masnoon]”

    [al-Hijr 15:26]

    Al-Raazi said:

    Al-hama’ means black mud. 
    

    (Mukhtaar al-Sihaah, p. 64). 

    It says in Lisaan al-‘Arab (1/61):

    Al-hama’ means black, stinking 
    mud. In the Qur’aan it says “min hama’in masnoon.” 

    And it says in Lisaan al-‘Arab (13/227): 

    “Masnoon means muntin (stinking), as in the 
    verse ‘min hamaa’in masnoon.’ Abu ‘Amr said: this means altered and 
    stinking. Abu’l-Haytham said: sunna al-ma’, fa huwa masnoon, i.e., 
    the water changed, so it was altered (masnoon).” 

    When this mud was mixed with sand, it became salsaal 
    (dried clay). 

    Al-Raazi said: 

    Salsaal is hot mud mixed with 
    sand, so it starts to clank or clatter when it dries. If it is baked with 
    fire it becomes fired clay or earthenware pottery. 

    Mukhtaar al-Sihaah, 1/154. 

    It says in Lisaan al-‘Arab (11/382): 

    Al-Salsaal min al-teen (clay 
    made from mud) is that which has not been made into pottery. Any mud or clay 
    that dries is described as salla saleelan (rattling or clattering) … 
    i.e., it makes a noise like new pottery. Thus salsaal is likened to 
    pottery, as in the verse,  

    “He created man (Adam) from sounding clay like the clay of 
    pottery”

    [al-Rahmaan 55:14 – interpretation of the meaning]

    All of this is confirmed by the hadeeth of Abu Moosa 
    al-Ash’ari who said: “I heard the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: ‘Allaah created Adam from a handful 
    that He gathered from the entire earth, so the sons of Adam come like the 
    earth. Some of them are red, some are white, some are black and some are in 
    between. Some of them are easy, some of them are difficult, some are evil 
    and some are good.”

    (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2955; Abu Dawood, 4693. Al-Tirmidhi 
    said that this hadeeth is hasan saheeh, and it was classed as saheeh by Ibn 
    Hibbaan, 14/29; al-Haakim, 2/288; and al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 
    3926). 

    This is how Adam was created: from the earth – i.e. from its 
    dust – which was then mixed with water to form mud, which then became black, 
    stinking mud. And this dust was created from the earth which is partly sand 
    and when it is mixed it becomes sounding clay like the clay of pottery. 

    Hence when Allaah describes the creation of Adam in the 
    Qur’aan, in each case He describes one of the stages through which his 
    creation passed and through which the mud was formed. So there is no 
    contradiction in the verses of the Qur’aan. 

    Then after that the sons of Adam started to multiply and they 
    were created through water which is the sperm and fluids which are emitted 
    by men and women, as is well known. 

    This is explained by the Qur’aan in the verses 
    (interpretation of the meanings): 

    “And it is He Who has created man from water, and has 
    appointed for him kindred by blood, and kindred by marriage”

    [al-Furqaan 25:54]

    “Then He made his offspring from semen of despised water 
    (male and female sexual discharge)”

    [al-Sajdah 32:8]

    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    When the perfection, complete power, all-encompassing 
    knowledge, ever-executed will and utmost wisdom of the Lord decreed that His 
    creation should be of materials of different kinds, and that they should 
    vary in their forms and attributes and natures, His wisdom decreed that He 
    should take a handful of dust from the earth, then mix it with water. So it 
    became like black stinking mud. Then the wind was sent upon it and it dried 
    out, until it became clay like pottery. Then it was given shape and limbs 
    and faculties, and each part of it was given a shape suited to its purpose.

     Then he mentioned how people are created by means of 
    intercourse and the emission of semen.

      questions that need answering:
      1. I have a few Muslim male friends, we are very close and they treat me as an equal, if I
      had to convert to Islam would their attitutes towards me have to change, e.g. when I visit
      their houses, their wifes are very much in the background while I am allowed to sit with
      the men and partake in the conversation the wifes are usually busy in the kitchens or else
      busy with the kids or generally sit and watch TV while we talk; I would not like to loose
      these special moments with my friends;
      2. What will I be able to do about Friday prayers? I work in a place where my situation is
      very difficult. My collegeus are very prejudice against Muslims and I am afraid that
      should I convert they will freak. I have read somewhere that you can appoint someone to do
      the prayers for you, is that true?
      3. My family are all very staunch Christians and I was brought up as a christian, I am
      also married to a christian but he has no objections to my studying and practicing Islam,
      if I had to convert how can I get my family to leave me alone?
      4. Obviously this is a big step for me and I do still have doubts as to whether I am doing
      the right thing, how can one be 100% sure that you are doing the right thing. In my heart
      I feel OK about this although my mind has a lot of worries as you can notice from my
      questions. I am sure of the Oneness of God and have always been. I have read the Choice by

“And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will 
  never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.”
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:85]
Maybe you have compared (religions, etc.) and read widely and 
  have reached the conviction that this is the true religion which you must follow, 
  but this is not enough and it will not save a person just to believe in the 
  Oneness of Allaah and the Prophethood of Muhammad  
  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the resurrection after death. 
  He must also utter the Shahadataayn and practise Islam. It seems to us that 
  your hesitation is not due to lack of conviction of the truth but because of 
  certain fears that have to do with social factors such as friends, family, husband 
  and job.
One aspect of the answer may be found under Question # 4775, 
  so please refer to that. As far as your Muslim acquaintances are concerned, 
  you will be sitting with their wives, not with the men, as is dictated by Islamic 
  teaching. If you find this difficult at first, you will find it easy later on. 
  If these women are too busy, then look for other sincere Muslim women who you 
  can make friends with and encourage one another to adhere to the truth.
If you are sincere towards Allaah, He will help 
  you to overcome your difficulties with your husband and family. With regard 
  to Friday Prayers, this is not obligatory for women because the Prophet of Islam 
   (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
  “It is a duty for every Muslim to pray Jumu’ah in congregation apart 
  from four: slaves, women, young boys and the sick.” (Reported by 
  Abu Dawood, 901). Women have to pray four rak’ahs of Zuhr 
  prayer on Friday wherever they are. What you have heard about a person delegating 
  someone else to pray on his behalf is not correct at all. Prayer is fard 
  ‘ayn, i.e., an individual duty for each Muslim, and it is not acceptable 
  for one person to appoint someone else as a proxy or for one person to pray 
  on behalf of another. In any case, you have no need for this in the case of 
  Jumu’ah prayers, as you now know.
Briefly, all you need in your case is to put your trust in 
  Allaah and strive to please Him. Go ahead and embrace His religion even if it 
  makes other people angry. So long as you accept Him as your Lord and God, and 
  follow His religion, He will never let you down or forsake you. We believe that 
  you are ready to take this great step, in sha Allaah, so remember our advice 
  in brief is “Go for it” and put your trust in Allaah. We ask Allaah 
  to give you strength.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

    are faced with the problem of linguistic assimilation, whereby we speak the language of
    the Kuffaar in the west in a conscious or unconscious effort to get along with the people
    around us, and because we are influenced by the environment we are in. What is the Islamic
    view of this problem, and how can we overcome it?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh al-Islam Ahmad ibn ‘Abd al-Haleem ibn
    Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) spoke very effectively about this problem,
    explaining its seriousness and effects, and the Islamic viewpoint concerning it. This is
    what he said:
“As for becoming accustomed to talking to one another in a
    language other than Arabic, which is the symbol of Islam and the language of the
    Qur’aan, so that this becomes a habit in the land, with one’s family and
    household members, with one’s friends, in the marketplace, when addressing government
    representatives or authority figures or when speaking to people of knowledge, undoubtedly
    this is makrooh (disliked), because it involves being like the non-Arabs, which is
    makrooh, as stated previously.
Hence when the early Muslims went to live in Syria and Egypt, where the
    people spoke Byzantine Greek, and in Iraq and Khurasaan, where the people spoke Farsi, and
    the Maghrib (North Africa) where the people spoke Berber, they taught the people of those
    countries to speak Arabic, so that Arabic became the prevalent language in those lands,
    and all the people, Muslim and kaafir alike, spoke Arabic. Such was also the case in
    Khurasaan in the past, then they became lax with regard to the language and got used to
    speaking Farsi until it became prevalent and Arabic was forgotten by most of them.
    Undoubtedly this is makrooh.
The best way is to become accustomed to speaking Arabic so that the
    young people will learn it in their homes and schools, so that the symbol of Islam and its
    people will prevail. This will make it easier for the people of Islam to understand the
    Qur’aan and Sunnah, and the words of the Salaf, unlike a person who gets used to
    speaking one language, then wants to learn another, and finds it difficult.
Know that being used to using a language has a clear and strong effect
    on one’s thinking, behaviour and religious commitment. It also has an effect on
    making one resemble the early generations of this Ummah, the Sahaabah and Taabi’een.
    Being like them improves one’s thinking, religious commitment and behaviour.
Moreover, the Arabic language itself is part of Islam, and knowing
    Arabic is an obligatory duty. If it is a duty to understand the Qur’aan and Sunnah,
    and they cannot be understood without knowing Arabic, then the means that is needed to
    fulfil the duty is also obligatory.
There are things which are obligatory on all individuals (fard
    ‘ayn), and others which are obligatory on the community or ummah (fard kifaayah,
    i.e., if some people fulfil them the rest are relieved of the obligation).
This is the meaning of the report narrated by Abu Bakr ibn Abi Shaybah
    who said: ‘Eesa ibn Yoonus told us from Thawr from ‘Umar ibn Yazeed that
    ‘Umar wrote to Abu Moosa al-Ash’ari (may Allaah be pleased with him) and said:
    ‘learn the Sunnah and learn Arabic; learn the Qur’aan in Arabic for it is
    Arabic.’
According to another hadeeth narrated from ‘Umar (may Allaah be
    pleased with him), he said: ‘Learn Arabic for it is part of your religion, and learn
    how the estate of the deceased should be divided (faraa’id) for these are part
    of your religion.’
This command of ‘Umar, to learn Arabic and Sharee’ah,
    combines the things that are needed, for religion involves understanding words and
    actions. Understanding Arabic is the way to understand the words of Islam, and
    understanding the Sunnah is the way to understand the actions of Islam…”
(Iqtidaa’ al-Siraat al-Mustaqeem, 2/207)
In addition to the above, we advise the following:
Muslims should strive – along with their families and children
        – to speak Arabic in their homes and gatherings. Parents should set the example for
        their children within the home, and sometimes they should deliberately not answer their
        children if they do not speak Arabic.

Try to put the children in Arabic schools and academies wherever
        possible.

Families should try to form housing co-ops or live close to one another,
        so that the neighbourhood and the local environment will be Arabic-speaking.

Try to set up Arabic-language courses and seek reward and draw closer to
        Allaah by doing so. Books, tapes and other modern educational means should be used for
        this purpose.

Continually listening to recordings of the Qur’aan, listening to
        lessons on tape and attending Islamic lectures in Arabic.

Is Wudu necessary for Sujudt At-Tilawah?","Praise be to Allah.Can you do Sujud At-Tilawah Whilst mensturating?
The Standing Committee for Academic Research and Issuing Fatwas said:
“In the cases where a menstruating woman is permitted to recite the Quran, she is also permitted to do Sujud At-Tilawah , if she happens to recite or hear a verse where the Sajdah is prescribed. 
The correct view is that it is permissible for a menstruating woman to recite the Quran from memory, not from the Mus-haf (Quran hard copy). So on this basis, the Sujud is prescribed for her , because it is not prayer, rather it is an act of submission to Allah and worship, like other kinds of Dhikr.
Is Wudu necessary for Sujudt At-Tilawah?
The correct view is that (Wudu) it is not a condition for Sujud Ash-Shukr and Sujud At-Tilawah. It is not mandatory for the one who is reciting or listening to be in a state of ritual purity , because they do not come under the rulings of prayer.

    law. One should not remain with an alcoholic as he harms his wife and his children. One
    should remain away from him unless Allah guides him and he returns to what is correct. If
    the judge separates the two, usually, the children are given over to the mother as she is
    most qualified for them while he is not qualified. As long as he has the problem of being
    an alcoholic, he is not suited to bring up his children as he will destroy and ruin them.
    Therefore, she has more right to her children than him, even if they be boys. This is what
    is usually done by the judges and this is what is obligatory. The children must be with
    her because she is better than him and he is an evildoer. If she refuses to go back to
    him, she has done well, as such a living condition is harmful and dangerous for her. If he
    also does not pray, then it is obligatory not to return to him for the one who abandons
    the prayer is a disbeliever-- and protection is sought from Allah. The Prophet (peace be
    upon him) said, ""The covenant between us and them is the prayer. Whoever abandons it
    has committed disbelief.""l
    It is not obligatory to remain with the one who does not pray.2
    ""They are not lawful [wives] for the disbelievers nor are the disbelievers lawful
    [husbands] for them"" (al-Mumtahina 10).
    [That is,] until Allah guides them and they repent. The woman should go to her family or
    stay with her children and not let her husband come to them until he repents to Allah and
    returns to what is right.If he prays but drinks alcohol, then that is a great sin and
    great crime. 
    However, he is not a disbeliever but an evildoer.The woman has the right to prevent him
    from her and to leave him. She is excused for that act. If she remains patient and has the
    ability to be patient, there is no harm in that option either.

    her past mistakes. Whoever conceals a Muslims faults, Allaah will conceal his faults
    in this world and the next. Allaah is Forgiving and Merciful, He forgives and accepts the
    repentance of the one who turns to Him in repentance. So we should be forgiving and should
    treat the one who has repented in accordance with the way he is now, and help him to
    continue to repent. The one who has repented is like one who has never sinned at all. If
    the husband conceals his wifes past mistakes and treats her well, this will be of
    immense benefit in helping this woman adhere to the straight path and encouraging her to
    continue living a life of purity and chastity; her husband will also have a great reward
    for concealing her faults, keeping her chaste and helping her to avoid evil and stay on
    the straight path, living under his care in a pure atmosphere in the marital home.
If this woman is still persisting in mischief and going out with men
    and committing haraam actions, and does not repent despite being advised to do so, then we
    do not suggest that he should keep her at all. Let him get rid of her and Allaah will
    provide him with another wife.
If she has repented, but he cannot bear what she has done in the past,
    and he is tormented with bad thoughts that give him sleepless nights, and he is scared
    that if he keeps her he may mistreat her even though she has repented, then he can divorce
    her so as to give himself peace of mind and avoid mistreating her. But he should look at
    the matter anew and think long and hard about the advice we have given here. Let him think
    about himself too: maybe he has made mistakes in the past, or will do so in the future. We

Should he recite the Tashahhud or not? Should he say salaam afterwards or not?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: the person who is doing sajdat al-tilaawah should say Takbeer when going down, because of the hadeeth narrated by Abu Dawood in his Sunan from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to recite Quran to us, and if he reached a verse where a sajdah was prescribed, he would say Takbeer and prostrate and we would do likewise.”
(Reported by Ahmad, 2/17; al-Bukhaari, 2/33,34; Muslim, 1/405, no. 575). He should not say Takbeer when coming up from the sujood, because there is no report from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to indicate that, and because sajdat al-tilaawah is an act of worship, and acts of worship are to be done in accordance with what is prescribed in sharee’ah. What was reported from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was Takbeer when going down into sujood al-tilaawah, not when coming up. But if a person is doing sajdat al-tilaawah when praying, then he should say takbeer both when going down and when coming up, because of the general meaning of the saheeh ahaadeeth which describe the prayer of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and state that he said Takbeer each time he went down into sujood or came up.
Secondly: one should not recite al-Tashahhud or say salaam after doing sajdat al-tilaawah, because there is no proof that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did that. Sajdat al-tilaawah is an act of worship and as such should be done as prescribed as in sharee’ah and we cannot make qiyaas (analogy) comparing it to the tashahhud and salaam in prayer.
