42054,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/42054,There is nothing wrong with using the expression “by chance”,"Is it permissible to use the expression “by chance”, such as saying, “I went to the market and I met So and so by chance”?
 Is this phrase “by chance” haraam or does it constitute shirk (associating others with Allaah)? What should I say instead of this? Please advise me, may Allaah reward you with good.",,,"Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with using the phrase “by chance,” because what the speaker means is that he met that person without a prior agreement to meet, and without intending to do so; he does not mean that this meeting happened without the decree of Allaah. 
The use of this expression (sudfatan in Arabic) is mentioned in some ahaadeeth, such as that narrated by Muslim (2144) from Anas who said: I set out with him (i.e., with ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Abi Talhah) to go to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and we met him by chance and he was carrying a branding iron… 
Abu Dawood (142) narrated that Laqeet ibn Sabrah said: I came among the delegation of Banu’l-Muntafiq to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). When we came to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) it so happened that we did not find him in his house but by chance ‘Aa’ishah the Mother of the Believers was there…. This hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (3/393): 
The expression used by many people, “I met So and so by chance” etc is not haraam and does not constitute shirk, because what is meant is meeting him without a prior appointment or agreement to meet, for example, and there is nothing wrong with this meaning. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was asked: What is your opinion on using the expression “by chance”? 
He replied: 
We think that there is nothing wrong with this expression. This is a customary expression which is mentioned in several ahaadeeth: We met the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) by chance, etc. 
With regard to people’s actions, things do happen by chance, because people have no knowledge of the Unseen and a thing may happen without a person realizing it or doing the things that lead to it or expecting it. But with regard to the actions of Allaah, this is not the case, for everything is known to Allaah and everything is decreed by Him. With regard to Him nothing ever happens by chance, but with regard to you and me, we may meet without prior arrangement and without realizing or planning it. This is what we call chance, and there is nothing wrong with that. But with regard to the actions of Allaah, this word cannot be used.

Does the same apply to Islamic tapes which contain recordings of the Noble Quran?,"1.	Taking the Mus-haf into bathrooms and other unclean places is forbidden because that is disrespectful towards the Words of Allah. If one fears that the Mus-haf may be stolen, then they can take it into the bathroom. 
2.	It is permissible to take tapes of the Quran into the bathroom.",,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
“The scholars clearly stated that taking the Mus-haf into bathrooms (toilets) and other unclean places is forbidden, because that is disrespectful towards the Words of Allah. However, if a person fears that it may be stolen if he leaves it outside the bathroom, or he is afraid that he will forget it, then there is no sin on him if he takes it in, because it is essential to protect it.
Tapes are not like Mus-hafs, because tapes do not contain any writing. All that is there is certain vibrations which produce sound when passed through a certain machine. Hence tapes may be taken into the bathroom and there is no problem with that.” (Liqa’at Al-Bab Al-Maftuh, 3/439) 
Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:  
“Entering the bathroom with the Mus-haf is not permissible except in cases of necessity; if one fears that it may be stolen, then there is no sin in that.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn Baz, 10/30)

42072,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/42072,Should the equipment in a store be included when calculating zakah?,"I want to ask about zakah, I have a store selling stationery and offering services for students. I have read about zakah on trade goods when one year has passed, but there is a question about student services – should photocopying equipment be included when calculating zakah, as it is very costly?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
You have to pay zakah on all the wealth that you have in the form of cash or products offered for sale in the stationery store after one full (Hijri) year has passed, if their value meets the minimum threshold for zakah (nisab). 
Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 9/313. 
Secondly: 
The nisab is twenty mithqaal of gold, i.e., eighty-five grams; or one hundred and forty mithqaal of silver (i.e., 595 grams). The equivalent in Saudi dirhams of silver is fifty-six riyals.” 
Fatawa al-‘Uthaymeen, 18/93. 
If the value of the goods offered for sale, plus the cash money that you have is equal to one of these two nisabs, gold or silver, then you have to pay zakah. 
Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 9/257. 
Thirdly: 
How zakah is to be calculated. 
If one year has passed for the threshold, you should calculate how much money you have, and add to that the value of the goods offered for sale in the stationery store, then pay one-quarter of one-tenth (i.e., 2.5%) of the total, which you should give to those who are entitled to it of the groups mentioned in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“As-Sadaqaat (here it means zakah) are only for the Fuqaraa’ (poor), and Al-Masaakeen (the poor) and those employed to collect (the funds); and to attract the hearts of those who have been inclined (towards Islam); and to free the captives; and for those in debt; and for Allah’s Cause (i.e. for Mujaahidoon — those fighting in a holy battle), and for the wayfarer (a traveller who is cut off from everything); a duty imposed by Allah. And Allah is All-Knower, All-Wise” [Al-Tawbah 9:60]
The value of the goods on sale in the stationery store should be based on the price for which they are sold, not the price for which they were bought. See question no. 26236. 
Fourthly: 
With regard to the photographic equipment, there is no zakah on it, unless you have prepared it for sale. 
Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
There is no zakah on items that are for use, whether they are tools or other things. The basic principle is that whatever is prepared for sale is that on which zakah is due. Tools or equipment used in the store are not subject to zakah.

Now I am staying with my friend, there also I realize a noise, but if I stay alone, then it troubles me a lot. I used to pray 5 times and recite the Quran in the morning and while going to bed.

Reading Surah al-Muzzammil and al-Mulk before sleep: Any evidence?","Praise be to Allah.Do the jinn exist?
These noises and actions may come from the jinn. The jinn are part of the creation of Allah whose existence we must believe in, because Allah mentions them in many verses of the Quran, and there is even a Surah named after them, namely Surah al-Jinn. Their existence is a matter upon which there is consensus.
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
“All nations believe in the jinn and they have had many encounters with them, which would take too long to describe. No one denies the existence of the jinn except for a very few ignorant philosophers and doctors and the like.” [Majmu’ al-Fatawa]
What powers do the jinn have in Islam?
Their powers are greater than those of man, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“An ‘Ifrit (strong one) from the jinn said: “I will bring it [the throne of the Queen of Saba] to you before you rise from your place.” [An-Naml 27:39]
There was a great distance between Sulayman (peace be upon him) and the Queen of Saba (Sheba). 
Can the jinn control righteous people?
Allah has enabled the jinn to change shape and to fly, etc, but despite their great powers they have no control over the righteous slaves of Allah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Verily, My slaves (i.e. the true believers of Islamic Monotheism) — you have no authority over them. And All-Sufficient is your Lord as a Guardian.” [ Al-Isra 17:65]
“And he (Satan) had no authority over them, except that We might test him who believes in the Hereafter, from him who is in doubt about it.” [Saba 34:21]
Even the Shaytan acknowledged this and said:
“[Iblis] said: ‘O my Lord! Because You misled me, I shall indeed adorn the path of error for them (mankind) on the earth, and I shall mislead them all. Except Your chosen, (guided) slaves among them.’” [Al-Hijr 15:39-40 – interpretation of the meaning]
Who can be controlled by the jinn?
Rather he has control over those people who agree with his disbelief and follow him willingly, as Allah tells us (interpretation of the meaning):
“Certainly, you shall have no authority over My slaves, except those who follow you of the Ghawun (those who go astray, criminals, polytheists, and evildoers).” [Al-Hijr 15:42]
Allah may give them [the jinn] power over believers because of their sins, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah is with the qadi (judge) so long as he is not unjust; if he is unjust then Allah has nothing to do with him and will cause the Shaytan to stay with him.” [al-Hakim and al-Bayhaqi]
How to protect yourself from the jinn
The Muslim must, above all else, arm himself with the weapon of faith and righteous deeds, for these are the best provision he may have and the best means of foiling the plots of the devils among mankind and the jinn.
You have to strengthen your relationship with Allah, for He is the One on Whom you should depend. Remember Allah a great deal in all situations, and strive to keep your tongue busy constantly with dhikr (remembrance of Allah). No one can find any better protection against the Shaytan than the remembrance of Allah. 
It was narrated in a sahih (authentic) report from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that Allah enjoined five things upon Yahya ibn Zakariyya, which he was to do and to command the Children of Israel to do, one of which was: “I command you to remember Allah, for the likeness of that is that of a man whose enemy comes after him, until he comes to a strong fortress where he protects himself from him. Similarly, a person cannot protect himself against the shaytan except by remembering Allah.” [Sahih al-Tirmidhi]
Constantly recite the dhikrs narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), such as the dhikr when entering the toilet, when having intercourse, when hearing the braying of a donkey, when entering the house, in the morning and the evening, when going to sleep, and in other circumstances and at other times for which a specific dhikr has been narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).
These dhikrs have been compiled in books such as al-Adhkar by al-Nawawi, al-Kalim al-Tayyib by Ibn Taymiyah, and Hisn al-Muslim by al-Qahtani [the latter is available with English transliteration and translation under the title “Fortress of the Muslim – Invocations from the Quran and Sunnah”, published by Darussalam, Riyadh – Translator].
You should also read a lot of Quran in the house, especially Surah al-Baqarah. Ahmad and Muslim narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not make your houses (like) graveyards, for the Shaytan flees from a house in which Surah al-Baqarah is read.”
You should also purify your house of everything in which there is disobedience towards Allah, such as keeping images and dogs. Abu Talhah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or an image.” [al-Bukhari, Muslim]
If there are no angels in the house, it will become a dwelling for the devils.
Reading Surah al-Muzzammil and al-Mulk before sleep: Any evidence?
With regard to reading Surah al-Muzzammil and al-Mulk when going to sleep, there are reports that indicate that it is mustahabb (recommended) to recite Surah al-Mulk before sleeping. Al-Tirmidhi narrated from Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used not to sleep until he had recited Alif-Lam-Meem Tanzeel (al-Sajdah) and Tabarak alladhi bi yadihi’l-mulk (Surah al-Mulk). [Sahih al-Tirmidhi].
With regard to Surah al-Muzzammil, there is no report to indicate that it is mustahabb to recite it when going to sleep.

42088,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/42088,Voluntary Hajj on Behalf of Deceased Parents or Giving Charity?,"Is it better for me to do Hajj on behalf of my deceased parents, knowing that they had done the obligatory Hajj, or to give that money towards building a mosque or towards jihad for the sake of Allah?","Doing Hajj on behalf of deceased parents, offering sacrifices on their behalf, and giving charity on their behalf, are undoubtedly permissible, but there is something that is better than that, because du’a is better than that.","The best way to honor your deceased parents


Voluntary Hajj on behalf of deceased parents","Praise be to Allah.The best way to honor your deceased parents
The best way in which a person can honour his parents is the way taught by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), which is to make du’a for them, pray for forgiveness for them, honour their friends and uphold the ties of kinship, for you have no ties of kinship except through them. 
This is what was stated by the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when someone asked him: “O Messenger of Allah, is there anything I can do to honour my parents after they die?” This is the reply that he gave. 
Voluntary Hajj on behalf of deceased parents
As for doing Hajj on their behalf , offering sacrifices on their behalf , and giving charity on their behalf , that is undoubtedly permissible, and we do not say that it is haram, but there is something that is better than that, because du’a is better than that. 
So make these deeds that you want to do on their behalf on your own behalf – do Hajj on your own behalf, give charity on your own behalf, offer a sacrifice on behalf of yourself and your family, spend money on building mosques and on jihad for the sake of Allah on your own behalf. 
You will need righteous deeds just as your parents do, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has taught you what is best and most beneficial for your parents. Do you think that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was unaware that it is better for you to do Hajj and give charity?! 
No, we can never believe that the Messenger was unaware of that. We know that the Messenger chose these four things: du’a, praying for forgiveness, honouring one’s parent’s friends and upholding the ties of kinship, because these are honouring one’s parents in a real sense. 
Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When a person dies, all his good deeds come to an end except three: ongoing charity (sadaqah jariyah), beneficial knowledge, or a righteous son who will pray for him.” 
He did not say: or a righteous son who will give charity on his behalf, or offer a sacrifice on his behalf, or perform Hajj on his behalf, or fast on his behalf – even though the hadith speaks of righteous deeds. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not suggest doing good deeds on behalf of the deceased and suggested making du’a instead. 
We bear witness to Allah and we know with certainty that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would not have turned to something inferior and ignored that which is better, because he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was the most knowledgeable and most sincere of people. 
If giving charity, offering a sacrifice, praying or performing Hajj had been prescribed in this case, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would have told us about it. 
I say to the seekers of knowledge concerning such matters where the common folk follow the inferior way, that they should explain to them and say, Show me a single text in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoined observing a voluntary fast or giving voluntary charity on behalf of one's parents. You will never find one. 
Rather he said: “If a person dies owing obligatory fasts, his heir should fast on his behalf.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoined observing obligatory fasts on behalf of the deceased, not voluntary fasts. 
Search through the entire Sunnah from beginning to end; can you find any mention that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoined giving charity on behalf of one's parents, or observing voluntary fasts on behalf of one's parents, or performing a voluntary Hajj on behalf of one's parents, or spending money on the public interest on behalf of one’s parents? No, you will never find any such things. 
The most that can be said is that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) approved of this, and approval of a thing does not mean that it is encouraged in shari’ah. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) approved of Sa’d ibn 'Ubadah when he asked for permission to give his garden as charity on behalf of his mother, and said, “Yes.” He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) also approved of the one who said, “My mother has died, and I think that if she could have spoken, she would have given charity; can I give charity on her behalf?” He said, “Yes.”
But did he command his ummah to do voluntary acts for the sake of Allah and give the reward to the dead? This is not the case, and anyone who can find such a report, let him tell us about it. The only exception is obligatory acts, for what is obligatory must be done.” (Fatawa Ibn Uthaymin, 21,267)
