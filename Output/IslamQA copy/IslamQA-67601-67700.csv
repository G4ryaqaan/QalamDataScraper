67606,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/67606,Insinuating Whispers About Apostacy,"Many years ago (15 years) I read that apostatizing from Islam is one of the things that invalidates wudu (ablution) and that stuck in my mind. Every time I want to do wudu, I feel that I am a non-Muslim, and I repeat wudu more than once. It may be a kind of waswas (whispering from the shaytan) but I really felt as if I was a non-Muslim. I would repeat the Shahadatayn (testimony of faith) but there was a feeling inside that I didn’t believe it. But I would think about the meaning and I found that I believed in it, but the feeling that I am a non-Muslim will not go away. I weep and I pray to Allah to heal me from what has befallen me. 

I used to refuse to get married for fear of disbelief, lest it invalidate the marriage.

Despite all that, I still pray regularly, read Quran and listen to lectures. I know that the way to treat this waswas is not to pay any attention to it, but I was weak and I paid attention to it. I know that I am wrong. What should I do?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
	We ask Allah to heal you and 
	make you well, and to replace your waswas with peace of mind and certain 
	faith. 

	You should realize that what has 
	befallen you is a great test, and if you bear it with patience and seek 
	reward with Allah for it, you will attain a great deal of good, by Allah’s 
	leave. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: 
	“Calamity will continue to befall the believing man and the believing woman 
	with regard to themselves, their children and their wealth, until they meet 
	Allah with no sins on them.” (al-Tirmidhi (2399).

	Al-Tirmidhi (2396) and Ibn Majah 
	(4031) narrated from Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet 
	(peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The greatest reward comes 
	with the greatest trial. When Allah loves a people, He tests them. Whoever 
	accepts that wins His pleasure but whoever is discontent with that earns His 
	wrath.” So receive the glad tidings of a great reward, in sha Allah, and 
	remember that what you feel in yourself will not harm you, so long as you 
	love Allah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and 
	His religion, and you hate disbelief and its people. 

	There follows some advice with 
	which we ask Allah to benefit you: 

	1 – You should be certain that 
	this waswas comes from the shaytan and is not real. How can you be a 
	non-Muslim when you pray regularly, read Quran and listen to useful 
	lectures?  

	2 – You should remember Allah a 
	great deal (dhikr), so that the shaytaan, who is the source of this waswas, 
	will go away from you. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon 
	him) said: “… and He (Allah) has commanded you to remember Allah; and the 
	likeness of that is a man who was being pursued swiftly by the enemy, until 
	he reached a strong fortress in which he found protection; similarly a man 
	cannot find protection from the Shaytan except by remembering Allah.”

	3 – You know that the way to 
	treat this waswas is to ignore it, so continue to do that. 

	4 – You should fill your spare 
	time with things that will benefit you, so that you will not have time to 
	think about this waswas. 

	5 – You should pray to Allah a 
	great deal and turn to Him, and seek refuge with Him. Look for the times 
	when du’as are readily answered, such as the last third of the night and 
	while in prostration. 

	We ask Allah to heal you and 
	take away this evil from you.

67610,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/67610,Is his preferring to work with non-Muslims regarded as taking them as close friends?,Is working in a company that is owned by a kaafir regarded as taking the kuffaar as close friends?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Working for kaafirs and doing business with them is not regarded as taking them as close friends, but the Muslim must be very careful in choosing the right type of people, work and business. It is not permissible for him to work with or deal in haraam things, and it is not permissible for him to love those people in his heart, or to praise them in absolute terms. He must also be honest and proficient in his work so as to give a good example of Muslim morals and manners. 
Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan said: 
The kinds of friendship that are forbidden include supporting them against Muslims, supporting them with words that justify their ways, and feeling proud of their ways. All of these are forms of the friendship with them that is forbidden and that leads to apostasy from Islam (Allah forbid). Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And if any amongst you takes them (as Awliyaa’ [friends and supporters]), then surely, he is one of them. Verily, Allah guides not those people who are the Zaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers and unjust)” [Al-Maa'idah 5:51]
What is permitted to us is to deal with the kuffaar in ways that are permissible. So we may engage in trade with them, import goods from them, trade benefits with them, benefit from their experience, and bring in those of them whom we employ to do different types of work such as engineering and other kinds of permissible work. These are the limits within which we are permitted to interact with them, but we must be cautious and not give them any authority in the Muslim lands except within the limits of their work. They should not have any authority over the Muslims or over any Muslim, rather the Muslims should have authority over them.""(Al-Muntaqa min Fatawa al-Shaykh al-Fawzaan, 2/252)
Muslim bosses should fear Allah with regard to their work and their employees, and they should do work that is permissible. They should give their employees and workers their rights in full, with nothing lacking. They should not cause their workers and employees to leave them and go work for kaafir employers instead. 
Many Muslims think that it is the salary and other benefits that they get from the kaafir that is the motive for working for him, because they think that they are getting what they are entitled to. But this leads to bad consequences, such as praising those kuffaar and admiring their attitude and way of doing business. This may lead to taking them as close friends, which is a cause for fitnah (temptation and tribulation) for many of them with regard to their religious commitment after that. 
See the answer to question no. 2875 for the ruling on working for the kuffaar; and the answer to question no. 2371 where it states that it is permissible for a Muslim to work with a kaafir subject to certain conditions.

67614,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/67614,He is suffering from a skin disease on his lips – how should he do Wudu?,I have a skin problem on my lips.from past 6 years.if i am exposed to water ..my colour of the lips changes to white and more over my lips are very cracked....so i find it difficult to do wudu ...so can i in this case do tayammum.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
We ask Allah to heal you and make you well. 
Secondly: 
If your lips are harmed by using water when doing Wudu, then you have to wash whatever you can of your face, and the other parts of the body that are to be washed in Wudu, and then do tayammum instead of rinsing the mouth and washing the lips and surrounding area, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So keep your duty to Allah and fear Him as much as you can” [al-Taghaabun 64:16]
You can do tayammum before or after doing Wudu. 
With regard to not doing Wudu at all, and doing tayammum only, that is not permissible, rather in this case you have to combine washing the healthy parts of the body with doing tayammum. 
What we have said about Wudu applies also to ghusl. You have to wash your body and whatever you can of your face, as well as doing tayammum. 
It says in Zaad al-Mustaqni’: Whoever has been wounded may do tayammum for that part, and wash the rest. End quote. 
i.e., if a person has been wounded and cannot wash the site of the wound, then he should do tayammum for that, and wash the rest of his body that is healthy. 
The basic principle concerning that is that if a person is wounded or burned in a part of the body that is washed in Wudu, or has some sickness there, such cases fall into four categories: 
1 – When it is uncovered and washing it will not harm it. In that case it is obligatory to wash it.
2 – When it is uncovered and washing it will harm it but wiping it will not. In that case he must wipe over it.
3 – When it is uncovered and both washing and wiping will harm it. In that case he should do tayammum for that part, and wash the other parts.
4 – When it is covered with a dressing etc that is essential. In that case he should wipe over the covering, and do the rest of his Wudu, and not do tayammum. 
Fatawa Arkaan al-Islam by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, p. 234. 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about a person who did Wudu but his hand was injured and could not be washed with water, and he forgot to do tayammum for it and prayed. He said: If there is a wound in one of the places that must be washed in Wudu, that cannot be washed or wiped because that will lead to the injury being made worse or a delay in recovery, then this person must do tayammum. If a person does Wudu and misses a spot because of a wound, and starts to pray, then during the prayer he remembers that he did not do tayammum, then he should do tayammum and repeat his prayer, because what he did of prayer before doing tayammum is not valid… End quote from Majmoo’ Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 10/197.",Islam Q&A
67617,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/67617,Refraining From Doing Good Deeds for Fear of Showing Off,What are the guidelines on refraining from doing good deeds for fear of showing off?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.It should be noted that 
    the Shaytaan is keen to make the Muslim fall into one of two things: either 
    to make him do a good deed in order to show off and for the sake of his 
    reputation, and not sincerely for the sake of Allaah, or to make him refrain 
    from doing the good deed altogether. 

    The Muslim who is sincere in his intention will not pay any 
    attention to the whispers that the Shaytaan tries to impart to him 
    concerning his action, or his suggestion that it is not for the sake of 
    Allaah. He will not pay attention to the whispers of the Shaytaan suggesting 
    that he should refrain from doing the good deed for fear of showing off. The 
    sincere heart is equally at ease both when doing good deeds in secret and 
    when doing good deeds openly. 

    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: 

    A woman is asking: I am so afraid of showing off that I cannot advise some people or tell them not to do certain things such as backbiting, gossiping, and so on. I am afraid that that will be showing off 
    on my part, and I am afraid that people will think that I am showing off. So 
    I do not give them any advice (naseehah). I tell myself: They are educated 
    people, they do not need any advice. What do you suggest? 

    He replied: 

    This is one of the traps of the Shaytaan, by means of which 
    he prevents people from calling others to Allaah and from enjoining what is 
    good and forbidding what is evil. One of the ways in which he does this is 
    to make them think that this is showing off, or that people will think that 
    it is showing off. You should not pay any attention to that, rather what you 
    should do is go ahead and advise your sisters and brothers in faith, if you 
    see them falling short in any duty or committing haraam (impermissible) actions such as gossiping, setting people against one another, or not covering in front of men. Do not be afraid of 
    showing off, rather do it solely for the sake of Allaah, be sincere in your 
    intention and receive glad tiding of goodness. Ignore the tricks and 
    whispers of the Shaytaan. Allaah knows what is in your heart, your intention 
    and your sincerity towards Him and your sincerity towards His slaves. 
    Undoubtedly showing off is shirk (a form of disbelief)and is not permissible, but it is not permissible for a believing man or woman to refrain from doing something 
    that Allaah has enjoined, such as calling people to Him or enjoining what is 
    good and forbidding what is evil, for fear of showing off, so they should 
    beware of that. They should do what they are obliged to do among men and 
    women, and men and women are equal in this regard. Allaah has stated that in 
    His Holy Book where He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The believers, men and 
    women, are Awliyaa’ (helpers, supporters, friends, protectors) of one 
    another; they enjoin (on the people) Al‑Ma‘roof (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and 
    all that Islam orders one to do), and forbid (people) from Al‑Munkar (i.e. 
    polytheism and disbelief of all kinds, and all that Islam has forbidden); 
    they perform As-Salaah (establish prayers), and give the Zakaah (poor-due), and obey Allaah and His Messenger. Allaah will have His Mercy on them. Surely, Allaah 
    is All-Mighty, All-Wise”

    [al-Tawbah 9:71]

    Fataawa Ibn Baaz, 6/403 
It was narrated that 
    Husayn ibn ‘Abd al-Rahmaan said: I was with Sa’eed ibn Jubayr and he said: 
    “Which of you saw the star that fell last night?” I said, “I did.” Then I 
    said: “I wasn’t praying, but I had been stung…” 

    Narrated by Muslim, 220. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: 

    He said this (may Allaah have mercy on him) lest anyone think 
    that he was praying qiyaam (voluntary night prayer)and praise him for something that he had not done. This is unlike what some people do, when they are happy that the 
    people think that they were praying qiyaam, but that is contrary to 
    Tawheed(maintaining pure sincerity to Allah).

    What Husayn said does not come under the heading of showing 
    off, rather it comes under the heading of good deeds. It is not like one who 
    refrains from doing good deeds for fear of showing off, because the Shaytaan 
    may toy with a man and make the idea of refraining from doing good for fear 
    of showing off appear attractive to him. Rather you should do the good deed, 
    and try to avoid showing off to people.

67618,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/67618,Is it permissible for the worshipper to recite out loud in these prayers and rak‘ahs?,"Are these prayers done with the recitation out loud or quietly: the naafil prayer of Maghrib, the third rak‘ah of Witr prayer when it is done like Maghrib [three consecutive rak‘ahs], qiyaam al-layl [voluntary prayers at night], Sunnah of Fajr, and Duha prayer?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly:
The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) stated that what is prescribed is for the worshipper to recite quietly in naafil prayers offered during the day, and when praying at night, he has the choice between reciting out loud or quietly, but reciting out loud is better.
In Kashshaaf al-Qinaa‘ (1/441) it says that what is meant by day here is sunrise, not the break of dawn, so the regular Sunnah prayer of Fajr is a prayer that is offered at night.
We have quoted the views of the scholars concerning that in the answer to question no. 91325.
Based on that, the worshipper should recite quietly in Duha prayer, because it is a prayer that is offered during the day.
With regard to the naafil prayer of Maghrib, the third rak‘ah or Witr, qiyaam al-layl and the Sunnah of Fajr, the worshipper has the choice between reciting out loud or quietly, although reciting out loud is better, unless reciting quietly helps him to focus more, or he has people with him who will be disturbed by his reciting out loud, such as one who sleeping or one who is sick, and the like.
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
The Sunnah in prayers at night is to recite out loud, whether the worshipper is praying on his own or has someone else with him. If his wife or other women are praying with him, then they should pray behind him, even if there is only one woman. If he is praying on his own, then he has the choice between reciting out loud or quietly, and what is prescribed is for him to do that which help him focus more. ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) was asked about that and she said: The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would sometimes recite out loud in his night prayers and sometimes he would recite quietly. It is proven from him (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), in the hadith of Hudhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him) and others, that he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to recite out loud in the night prayers; he would pause at a verse that spoke of mercy and ask for mercy, and he would pause at a verse that mentioned punishment and seek refuge with Allah from that, and he would pause at a verse that mentioned glorification of Allah and glorify Him, meaning when reciting verses that mention the divine names and attributes, so he would glorify Allah. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “There has certainly been for you in the Messenger of Allah an excellent pattern [example]” [al-Ahzaab 33:21]. And the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Pray as you have seen me praying.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh.
These hadiths indicate that reciting out loud in the night prayers is better, and that is because it helps the heart to focus more and is more beneficial to those who are listening, unless there are people around him who are sick or sleeping, or are praying or reading Qur’an, in which case it is better for him to lower his voice so that he will not distract other worshippers and readers, or wake up those who are sleeping, or disturb those who are sick.
If he recites quietly in some of the night prayers when he is alone, there is nothing wrong with that, because of the hadith of ‘Aa’ishah mentioned above, and because that may help him to focus more and may be easier for him sometimes.
Majmoo‘ Fataawa ash-Shaykh Ibn Baaz (11/124, 125).
The shaykh (may Allah have mercy on him) also said:
If a person is praying by himself, it is prescribed for him to do that which will help him to focus more, of reciting out loud or quietly, if he is offering a naafil prayer at night and his reciting out loud will not disturb anyone. But if there are people around him who may be disturbed by his reciting out loud, such as other worshippers, people who are reading Qur’an or people who are sleeping, it is prescribed for him to keep his voice low.
But with regard to prayers offered during the day, such as Duha prayer, regular Sunnah prayers, Zuhr and ‘Asr, the Sunnah is to recite quietly in these prayers.
Majmoo‘ Fataawa ash-Shaykh Ibn Baaz (11/126, 127).
Secondly:
With regard to the questioner mentioning the third rak‘ah of Witr prayer when it is done like Maghrib [three consecutive rak‘ahs], the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade praying Witr in the same manner as Maghrib, and he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not pray Witr with three rak‘ahs, making it like Maghrib.” Narrated by al-Haakim (1/304); al-Bayhaqi (3/31); ad-Daaraqutni (p. 172). Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said in Fath al-Baari (4/301): Its isnaad is [saheeh] according to the conditions of the two shaykhs [al-Bukhaari and Muslim].
It is narrated in a saheeh report from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) that he prayed Witr with three rak‘ahs in two ways:

A prayer of three rak‘ahs with two tashahhuds and two salaams, so he prayed two rak‘ahs then said the salaam, then he prayed one rak‘ah and said the salaam.

It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to separate ash-shaf‘ [the even, the first two rak‘ahs of Witr] and al-witr [the odd, the last rak‘ah of Witr] with a tasleem [saying salaam] that he made us hear. Narrated by Ibn Hibbaan (2435). Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said in Fath al-Baari (2/482): Its isnaad is qawiy [strong].

He would pray the three rak‘ahs with one tashahhud and two tasleems.

It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) used to pray Witr with three rak‘ahs, only sitting [for tashahhud] in the last of them. Narrated by al-Bayhaqi (4581). This hadith was classed as saheeh by al-Haakim, and adh-Dhahabi agreed with him. Al-Mustadrak (1/304). Classed as saheeh by an-Nawawi in al-Majmoo‘ (4/7).
Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
With regard to praying five or three, sitting between each two rak‘ahs without saying the tasleem, we do not find that to be proven from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). The basic principle is that it is permissible, but because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade praying Witr with three rak‘ahs, and explained that by saying, “Do not pray Witr with three rak‘ahs, making it like Maghrib,” in that case the one who prays Witr with three rak‘ahs must avoid making it resemble Maghrib, which may be done in two ways:
The first is by saying the tasleem between  ash-shaf‘ [the even, the first two rak‘ahs of Witr] and al-witr [the odd, the last rak‘ah of Witr], which is the stronger view and is preferable; and the second is by not sitting [for tashahhud] between the first two rak‘ahs and the last rak‘ah,.

With regard to what the sleeper sees in his sleep, it falls into three categories: good dreams which come from Allaah; bad dreams which come from the shaytaan; and what a person is thinking about.  
Good dreams are those in which the sleeper sees good things; they come from Allaah. They may be meant as good news, or warning against evil, or helping and guiding. It is Sunnah to praise Allaah for them and to tell one’s loved ones, but not others, about them. 
Bad dreams are those in which the sleeper sees bad things; they come from the shaytaan. It is Sunnah to seek refuge with Allaah from them and to spit to the left three times, and not to talk about them, but if a person does that it will not harm him. It is also mustahabb to turn onto one’s other side, and to pray two rak’ahs. 
It may be that what one sees is not a dream of either of these two types, rather it stems from what one is thinking about. This is called confused dreams and it stems from events and fears stored in the memory and subconscious, which are replayed during sleep. For example, a man who works in a certain profession and spends all day working in that field, and before he goes to sleep he thinks about it, so he may see things having to do with it in his dream; or one who thinks about someone whom he loves and sees things that have to do with that person. There is no interpretation for these things. 
It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Towards the end of time, hardly any dream of a Muslim will be false. The ones who have the truest dreams will be those who are truest in speech. The dream of a Muslim is one of the forty-six parts of Prophethood. Dreams are of three types: a good dream which is glad tidings from Allaah, a dream from the Shaytaan which causes distress, and a dream that comes from what a man is thinking of to himself…” 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
The meaning of the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “The dreams of the believer are one of the forty-six parts of Prophethood” is that the dreams of the believer come true, because they are like parables that the angel gives to the one who sees them. They may tell of something that is happening or that is going to happen, so it happens in accordance with the dream, so these dreams are like the wahy of Prophethood in that they come true, yet they are different from it. Hence they are one of the forty-six parts of Prophethood.  
Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (1/327). 
The dreams of the believer are described in the ahaadeeth as “true” and “good” and “from Allaah”. What is meant by “true” is explained in the words of Ibn ‘Uthaymeen quoted above as meaning that they come true. What is meant by “good” is that they bring good news or draw attention to some mistakes that one is not aware of. What is meant by their being “from Allaah” is that they happen by His grace and mercy, or as a warning or glad tidings from Him, or as guidance from Him. 
Bad dreams are described as “causing grief” or being “from the shaytaan.” What is meant by “causing grief” is that they make one sad and cause distress. What is meant by them being “from the Shaytaan” is that they are instilled by him in an effort to cause fear or because of his toying with the sleeper. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:
Alarm comes from the shaytaan. The shaytaan depicts to a person in his sleep things that alarm him with regard to himself, his wealth or his family, or in his community, because the shaytaan loves to make the believers sad, as Allaah says: 
“Secret counsels (conspiracies) are only from Shaytaan (Satan), in order that he may cause grief to the believers. But he cannot harm them in the least, except as Allaah permits”
[al-Mujaadilah 58:10]
Everything that causes distress to people and upsets them, the shaytaan is eager for it, whether it is when they are awake or asleep, because the shaytaan is an enemy as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Surely, Shaytaan (Satan) is an enemy to you, so take (treat) him as an enemy”
[Faatir 35:6]
Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (1/329). 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) taught us what we should do if a person sees something in his dream that he dislikes and wakes up as a result. It is: spitting dryly to the left, seeking refuge with Allaah from the shaytaan, turning over, praying if one wants, and not telling people about it. 
We should point out an important matter, which is that if a person is righteous and strives to obey Allaah always, he will not be harmed if he sees or is seen (in a dream) in a situation that causes distress, but if he is an evildoer and sinner in his real life, then he will not benefit from seeing himself or being seen in the best state.  
Ibn Muflih said:  
Hishaam ibn Hassaan said: Ibn Sireen was asked about one hundred dreams and he did not give any answer except to say: Fear Allaah and do good whilst you are awake, and whatever you see in your sleep will not harm you. 
Al-Adaab al-Shar’iyyah (3/451). 
And he said: 
Al-Marwadhi said: I brought Ibraaheem al-Humaydi with me to meet Abu ‘Abd-Allaah, and he was a righteous man. He said: My mother saw [in a dream] that such and such happened to you, and she mentioned Paradise. He said: O my brother, the people used to say such things to Sahl ibn Salaamah, and Sahl rebelled and shed blood, and he said: Dreams may bring joy to the believer but they cannot deceive him. 
Al-Adaab al-Shar’iyyah (3/453). 
Conclusion: 
There may be warnings in a dream to the person or to others, of some mistake that they are negligent about, or some sin that they are committing, or of a bad end if they continue as they are, following deviation or misguidance. This cannot be the bad dreams which come from the shaytaan’s plots and efforts to cause grief, rather they come from Allaah by His grace and mercy. So if a person sees something in his dream which indicates that he should alert and warn others, he should do so. The same applies if he sees something that warns and alerts him (i.e., he should pay heed). 
You can warn your relative about a possible plot or evil that is expected, without mentioning who may be behind this plot. If you are worried that something bad may happen, then you should take precautions, and nothing will harm you in sha Allaah, even if what you fear happens. But if what you feared did not happen, and the dream did not come true, no harm will befall you because you did not speak badly of anyone and did not transgress against anyone.

    The kaafir is the one who denies and conceals the truth. The 
    basic meaning of the word kufr in Arabic is concealment. Shirk 
    means devoting worship to anyone or anything other than Allaah. 

    Kufr may take the form of denying and rejecting, but the 
    mushrik may also believe in Allaah. This is the difference between the 
    mushrik and the kaafir. 

    Each word may also carry the meaning of the other, so the 
    word kufr may be used in the sense of shirk, and the word shirk may be used 
    in the sense of kufr. 

    Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    Kufr and shirk may carry the same meaning, which is disbelief 
    in Allaah, may He be exalted, or they may be used separately, whereby shirk 
    refers to the worship of idols and other created beings, whilst also 
    acknowledging Allaah, as the kuffaar of Quraysh did, and kufr may have a 
    more general meaning than shirk. End quote. 

    Sharh Saheeh Muslim. 2/71 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez 
    ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    Kufr is denial and concealment of the truth, such as one who 
    denies that prayer is obligatory, or that zakaah is obligatory, or that 
    fasting Ramadaan is obligatory, or that doing Hajj when one is able to is 
    obligatory, or that honouring one's parents is obligatory, and so on, or one 
    who denies that zina is haraam, or that drinking intoxicants is haraam, or 
    that disobeying one’s parents is haraam, and so on. 

    Shirk is devoting acts of worship to something or someone 
    other than Allaah, such as one who seeks the help of the dead, those who are 
    absent, the jinn, idols, the stars, and so on, or who offers sacrifices to 
    them, or makes vows to them. A kaafir may be called a mushrik and a mushrik 
    may be called a kaafir, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And whoever invokes (or 
    worships), besides Allaah, any other ilaah (god), of whom he has no proof; 
    then his reckoning is only with his Lord. Surely, Al‑Kaafiroon (the 
    disbelievers in Allaah and in the Oneness of Allaah, polytheists, pagans, 
    idolaters) will not be successful”
    [al-Mu’minoon 23:117]

    “Verily, whosoever sets up partners (in worship) with 
    Allaah, then Allaah has forbidden Paradise to him, and the Fire will be his 
    abode”

    [al-Maa'idah 5:72]

    And Allaah says in Soorat Faatir (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “Such is Allaah, your Lord; His is the kingdom. And those, 
    whom you invoke or call upon instead of Him, own not even a Qitmeer (the 
    thin membrane over the date stone).

    14. If you invoke (or call upon) them, they hear not your 
    call; and if (in case) they were to hear, they could not grant it (your 
    request) to you. And on the Day of Resurrection, they will disown your 
    worshipping them. And none can inform you (O Muhammad) like Him Who is the 
    All‑Knower (of everything)”
    [Faatir 35:13-14]

    Their calling on anything other than Allaah is called shirk 
    in this soorah, but in Soorat al-Mu’minoon it is called kufr. 

    Allaah says in Soorat al-Tawbah (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “They (the disbelievers, the Jews and the Christians) want 
    to extinguish Allaah’s Light (with which Muhammad has been sent — Islamic 
    Monotheism) with their mouths, but Allaah will not allow except that His 
    Light should be perfected even though the Kaafiroon (disbelievers) hate 
    (it).

    33. It is He Who has sent His Messenger (Muhammad) with 
    guidance and the religion of truth (Islam), to make it superior over all 
    religions even though the Mushrikoon (polytheists, pagans, idolaters, 
    disbelievers in the Oneness of Allaah) hate (it)”

    [al-Tawbah 9:32-33]

    Here Allaah calls the kuffaar kuffaar, and He calls them 
    mushrikeen. This indicates that a kaafir may be called a mushrik and a 
    mushrik may be called a kaafir. There are many similar verses and 
    ahaadeeth. 

    Another example is the hadeeth in which the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Between a man and shirk 
    and kufr there stands his giving up prayer.” Narrated by Muslim in his 
    Saheeh from Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah (may Allaah be pleased with him). And 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The 
    covenant that differentiates us from them is prayer; whoever gives it up is 
    a kaafir.” Narrated by Imam Ahmad, Abu Dawood, al-Tirmidhi, al-Nasaa’i and 
    Ibn Maajah with a saheeh isnaad from Buraydah ibn al-Husayb (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him). And Allaah is the Source of strength. End quote. 

    Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 
    9/174, 175. 

    The Shaykh (may Allaah have mercy on him) also said:  

    It is also shirk to worship only something other than Allaah. 
    This is called shirk, and it is called kufr. Whoever turns away from Allaah 
    altogether and devotes his worship to something other than Allaah, such as 
    trees, rocks, idols, the jinn or some of the dead such as those whom they 
    call awliya’ (“saints”), and worship them, pray to them or fast for them, 
    and forget Allaah altogether, this is the worst form of kufr and shirk. We 
    ask Allaah to keep us safe and sound. Similarly those who deny the existence 
    of Allaah and say that there is no god, that life is only material, such as 
    the communists and atheists, are the most disbelieving and misguided of 
    people, and the worst in terms of shirk. We ask Allaah to keep us safe and 
    sound. The point is that people who hold these and similar beliefs are all 
    regarded as mushrikeen and kaafirs who disbelieve in Allaah. Some people, 
    out of ignorance, mistakenly regard calling upon the dead and seeking their 
    help as waseelah and think that it is permissible. This is a serious error, 
    because this action is one of the worst forms of shirk and associating 
    others with Allaah. Some ignorant people and mushrikeen call it waseelah, 
    but it is the religion of the mushrikeen whom Allaah criticized and 
    condemned. He sent the Messenger and revealed His Books to denounce it and 
    warn against it. End quote. 

    Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 
    4/32, 33 

    Secondly: 
The Jews and Christians 
    are both kaafirs and mushrikeen. They are kaafirs because they deny the 
    truth and reject it. And they are mushrikeen because they worship someone 
    other than Allaah. 

    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And the Jews say: ‘Uzair 
    (Ezra) is the son of Allaah, and the Christians say: Messiah is the son of 
    Allaah. That is their saying with their mouths, resembling the saying of 
    those who disbelieved aforetime. Allaah’s Curse be on them, how they are 
    deluded away from the truth!

    31. They (Jews and Christians) took their rabbis and their 
    monks to be their lords besides Allaah (by obeying them in things which they 
    made lawful or unlawful according to their own desires without being ordered 
    by Allaah), and (they also took as their Lord) Messiah, son of Maryam 
    (Mary), while they (Jews and Christians) were commanded [in the Tawraat 
    (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] to worship none but One Ilaah (God — 
    Allaah) Laa ilaaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He). 
    Praise and glory be to Him (far above is He) from having the partners they 
    associate (with Him)”

    [al-Tawbah 9:30, 31]

    Here they are described as mushrikeen. In Soorat al-Bayyinah 
    they are described as kaafirs, as Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “Those who disbelieve from among the people of the 
    Scripture (Jews and Christians) and Al‑Mushrikoon, were not going to leave 
    (their disbelief) until there came to them clear evidence”

    [al-Bayyinah 98:1]

    Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    said, refuting those who say that the word mushrikeen cannot be applied to 
    the People of the Book: 

    It is most likely that the people of the Book are included 
    among the mushrikeen, men and women alike, when this word is used in general 
    terms. because the kuffaar are undoubtedly mushrikeen. Hence they are 
    forbidden to enter al-Masjid al-Haraam, because Allaah says (interpretation 
    of the meaning): 

    “O you who believe (in Allaah’s Oneness and in His 
    Messenger Muhammad)! Verily, the Mushrikoon (polytheists, pagans, idolaters, 
    disbelievers in the Oneness of Allaah, and in the Message of Muhammad) are 
    Najasun (impure). So let them not come near Al‑Masjid Al-Haraam (at Makkah) 
    after this year”

    [al-Tawbah 9:28]
If the People of the 
    Book did not come under the general heading of mushrikeen, then this verse 
    would not apply to them, and Allaah would not have referred to the beliefs 
    of the Jews and Christians in Soorat Baraa’ah (al-Tawbah) where He says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “they (Jews and Christians) were commanded [in the Tawraat 
    (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] to worship none but One Ilaah (God — 
    Allaah) Laa ilaaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He). 
    Praise and glory be to Him (far above is He) from having the partners they 
    associate (with Him)”

    [al-Tawbah 9:31]
So they are all 
    described as mushrikeen, because the Jews said that ‘Uzayr is the son of God 
    and the Christians said that the Messiah is the son of God; and because they 
    took their priests and rabbis as lords instead of Allaah. All of this is the 
    worst form of shirk. And there are many similar verses. End quote.

67652,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/67652,Does a mother have to be fair in giving gifts to her children?,"I used to give my mother a thousand riyals every month, despite the fact that she did not need the money. That was an attempt on my part to do some small act of kindness to my parents. She used to save this money, and after a while I started to build a house just for me and I needed that money, so I stopped giving her that monthly amount. Then my mother suggested that I and my (married) sister who is not well off should share the money that belongs to her. Please note that I have a brother and another sister (who is also married) who are living a comfortable life. 
My question is: 
Is it permissible for me and my needy sister to share this money without giving any to our brother and other sister? If it is not permissible, then how should my mother share out this money?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
Allaah has enjoined fairness when giving to children, both males and females. 
It was narrated from al-Nu’maan ibn Basheer that his father brought him to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: “I have given this son of mine a slave.” He said, “Have you given a similar gift to all of your children?” He said, “No.” He said, “Then take it back.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (2446) and Muslim (1623). 
With regard to a parent favouring some children over others in giving, he or she should be fair in giving to them, either by taking back the gift, or giving gifts to the others so that they are all treated fairly. 
See al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 11/359. 
Secondly: 
The prohibition on favouring one child over another in gift-giving applies to the mother just as it applies to the father, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Fear Allaah and treat your children fairly.” And because she is one of the two parents, and she is forbidden to favour one child over another just as the father is. If the father shows favour to some of the children, that generates hatred and resentment. The same applies if the mother shows favour to some of her children over others. End quote. Al-Mughni, 8/261. 
Thirdly: 
The way in which gifts should be shared out among children, according to sharee’ah, is the same as the way in which inheritance is shared out, with the male getting the share of two females, because there is nothing more just than the way of dividing that is prescribed by Allaah. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Ikhtiyaaraat (p. 184): 
It is obligatory to treat children justly in gift-giving, along the same lines as the shares of inheritance. This is the view of Ahmad. End quote. 
Shurayh al-Qaadi said to a man who shared out his wealth among his children: The way in which Allaah has shared it is more just than the way in which you have shared it. Take it back and share it out in the manner decreed by Allaah. Narrated by ‘Abd al-Razzaaq in his Musannaf. 
‘Ata’ said: “They only used to share out (wealth) according to the Book of Allaah.  
See al-Mughni, 8/261 
It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (16/197): 
If your father wants to share out his wealth or some of his wealth among his children, he should share it out among males and females in accordance with the shares of inheritance prescribed by sharee’ah, whereby the male gets the share of two females. End quote. 
Fourthly: 
If the children are adults of sound mind, it is permissible for the father or mother to give one of their children more/less than others, so long as that is with their agreement and without any pressure. 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:  
The father must be just and fair to his children, males and females, along the lines of the shares of inheritance. It is not permissible for him to give gifts to some of them and not to others, except with the consent of those who are not given, if they are mature. Their consent should not be given out of fear of their father, rather it should be given willingly, with no threats or fear of their father. Not differentiating between them is better in all cases, and is better for their hearts, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Fear Allaah and treat your children justly.” Saheeh – agreed upon. End quote. 
Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 9/452 
The Shaykh (may Allaah have mercy on him) also said: 
There is no doubt that some children may be better than others, this is something that is well known, but the father has no right to differentiate between them because of that. Rather he must be fair, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:  “Fear Allaah and treat your children justly.” So it is not permissible for him to differentiate between them because one is better or honours his parents more than another. Rather he must treat them fairly and be sincere towards all of them, so that they will be kind to and honour their parents and obey Allaah and His Messenger. But he should not differentiate between them in gift giving, or leave money to some of them and not to others; rather they should all be treated fairly in terms of inheritance and gift-giving, and he should treat them fairly as prescribed in sharee’ah, with a male being given the share of two females. If a male child is given a thousand, a female should be given five hundred. If they are mature and easy-going, and they say, “Give our brother such and such,” and they clearly state that they do not mind if he is given a car or whatever, and it is clear that their tolerance is genuine and is not done under pressure or because they are afraid of him, then there is nothing wrong with that. 
What matters is that they should be treated fairly, unless the children are mature, whether males or females, and they do not mind if one of them is given something extra because of special circumstances, in which case there is nothing wrong with that and they have the right to do that. End quote. 
Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 9/235. 
Based on this, what your mother must do is to share this wealth fairly among you, giving each male the share of two females. If some of you are given more with the approval of the others, there is nothing wrong with that in sha Allaah.

67657,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/67657,What is the ruling on buying and selling shares in the Islamic Bank?,What is the ruling on buying and selling shares in the Islamic Bank?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.If this bank is calling 
    itself “Islamic” in order to deceive people, and it is dealing in riba or 
    other haraam transactions, then it is not an Islamic bank, and it is not 
    permissible to buy shares in it, or to buy and sell its shares, because that 
    is cooperating in doing something haraam. Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 
“Help you one another in 
    Al‑Birr and At‑Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one 
    another in sin and transgression”

    [al-Maa'idah 5:2]

    But if this bank is really Islamic, and organizes its 
    dealings in accordance with the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and does not engage in 
    haraam transactions, then there is nothing wrong with buying shares in it 
    and trading in its shares. Rather that should be done, because it will 
    encourage it and help it to deal with the challenges it faces as a result of 
    the spread of riba and haraam transactions. 

    In the answer to question no.
    47651 we have explained the 
    characteristics of an Islamic bank. 

    In Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (13/506) it says: 
If banks are based on 
    riba and deal in riba, then it is not permissible to buy shares in them, 
    because this is cooperating in sin and transgression, which Allaah has 
    forbidden when He said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“but do not help one 
    another in sin and transgression”

    [al-Maa'idah 5:2]. End quote. 

    It also says (13/507): 

    It is permissible to buy shares in banks that do not deal 
    with riba, and to take the profits that come from buying shares in the bank, 
    because this is the result of a transaction that is not haraam and there is 
    nothing wrong with it, so it is halaal. End quote. 

    It also says (13/508): 

    Buying shares in banks or companies that deal with riba is 
    not permitted. If a subscriber wants to get rid of his riba-based shares, he 
    should sell his shares at the current market value but only take his 
    capital; the rest should be donated to charity. It is not permissible for 
    him to take any of the interest of his shares or riba-based profits. But if 
    the shares are in a company that does not deal with riba, then their profits 
    are halaal. End quote.

67672,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/67672,What is the reason why Quran is recited out loud in some prayers and silently in others?,Is there a specific reason why Quran is recited silently in Zuhr and ‘Asr prayers and out loud in all the other obligatory prayers?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
Reciting out loud in the prayers in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) recited out loud, and silently in the prayers in which he recited silently, is one of the Sunnahs of prayer, not one of the obligatory duties. But it is better for the worshipper not to go against the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
Reciting out loud in the prayers where this is done is not obligatory, rather it is what is better. If a person recites silently in a prayer in which it is prescribed to recite out loud, his prayer is not invalid, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no prayer for one who does not recite the Essence of the Book (al-Fatihah).” He did not specify whether this recitation is to be out loud or silent. So if a person recites what he is required to recite, silently or out loud, then he has fulfilled his duty. But it is better to recite out loud in the prayers where doing so is customary, as in Fajr and Jumu’ah prayers. 
If a person deliberately does not recite out loud when he is leading the prayer, his prayer is valid but it is lacking.
 If a person is praying alone, he has the choice between reciting out loud or silently. He should look at what is more likely to increase his focus and humility in prayer, and do that. 
End quote. 
Majmoo’ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 13/73 
Secondly: 
The basic principle is that a Muslim is obliged to adhere to the laws of Allah, without making that dependent on whether he knows the reason or wisdom behind it. That does not mean that he should not try to find out the wisdom behind it, after following the command and adhering to the guidance. 
See question no. 20785 and 26862. 
Thirdly: 
The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked: 
Why do we pray Zuhr and ‘Asr silently and Maghrib and ‘Isha’ out loud? 
They replied: 
We do that following the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). We recite silently in the prayers in which he recited silently, and we recite out loud in the prayers in which he recited out loud, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Indeed in the Messenger of Allah (Muhammad) you have a good example to follow”
[al-Ahzaab 33:21]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Pray as you have seen me praying.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh.
Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 6/394, 395 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baz was asked:
 Why is it prescribed to recite out loud in Maghrib, ‘Isha’ and Fajr, and not in the other obligatory prayers? What is the evidence for that? 
He replied: 
Allah knows best the reason why it is prescribed to recite out loud in those prayers. The most likely reason – and Allah knows best – is that at night and at the time of Fajr prayer, people are more likely to benefit from recitation that is done out loud, as there are less distractions around them than at the time of Zuhr and ‘Asr. End quote. 
Majmoo’ Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baz (11/122) 
Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: 
What is the reason for reciting out loud in Jumu’ah prayer? 
He replied:  
The reason why it is recited out loud is – and Allah knows best – firstly so as to unite the people behind one imam, because if they are united behind one imam and listening attentively to him, that is a better form of unity than if each one of them were to recite to himself. In order to achieve this the people must all be gathered in one place, except in cases of necessity. 
The second reason is that the imam’s recitation out loud during the prayer is a completion of the two khutbahs. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to recite in Jumu’ah prayer soorahs that were appropriate, either al-Jumu’ah and al-Munaafiqeen, because the former mentions Jumu’ah and encourages us to attend the prayer, and the latter describes hypocrisy and denounces its people; or he would recite al-A’la and al-Ghaashiyah, because the former mentions the beginning of creation and describes various creatures and the beginning of divine laws, and the latter describes the Resurrection and rewards and punishments. 
The third reason is so as to distinguish between Zuhr and Jumu’ah. 
The fourth reason is so that it will be similar to Eid prayer, because Jumu’ah is the weekly “Eid”. End quote.

67691,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/67691,What should the imam do when there are people praying behind him who do innovated actions?,"Is it permissible to lead in prayer people who follow bid’ah, knowing that the imam has warned them about their innovations?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Innovations are not all 
    of the same degree. Some of them have to do with beliefs, some have to do 
    with minor practical issues of sharee’ah; some put a person beyond the pale 
    of Islam whereas others do not. In some cases the daa’iyah may think that 
    something is an innovation when it is not, or there may be a scholarly 
    opinion which is less correct than the opinion with which he is familiar, or 
    there may be another opinion on the matter of which he is not aware.  

    Usually questions are asked about an imam who is doing 
    innovated actions and the ruling thereon, and the answers are well known.  
    If his bid’ah is one that constitutes kufr, then it is not permissible to 
    pray behind him; if it does not constitute kufr, then it is valid to pray 
    behind him, but it is better to pray behind an imam who is of Ahl al-Sunnah. 
    Concerning such cases al-Hasan al-Basri (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
    “Pray, and he is accountable for his bid’ah.” 

    But if the question is about a bid’ah which the members of 
    the congregation are doing and the question is coming from the imam, there 
    is something a little odd about that. The job of the imam is not only to 
    lead the people in prayer, rather he also calls them, teaches them and 
    advises them. Any imam who leads the people in prayer will usually have 
    behind him people who shave their beards, deal in riba, disobey their 
    parents, backbite and spread gossip, and so on… they are the target audience 
    of the imam’s da’wah in the mosque.  

    Calling people to Allaah and teaching them is the mission of 
    the Prophets; they are also obligatory upon everyone to whom Allaah gives 
    knowledge, even if it is only a little. 

    This was the way of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him); if he saw a mistake he would correct it. 

    For example, when he saw a person praying badly and not 
    bowing or prostrating correctly, he taught him how to pray. Agreed upon. 

    When Mu’aawiyah ibn Hakam spoke during the prayer, the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) taught him that no 
    speech of man was appropriate during the prayer. Narrated by Muslim. 

    When the Bedouin urinated in the mosque, the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) explained to him that these 
    mosques are not the place for any of this filth. Agreed upon…. And there are 
    many more examples. 

    If the imam realizes that what some of the people are doing 
    is an innovation that goes against sharee’ah, then he should call them in 
    the manner that is best. He can do that by making the most of the best 
    opportunity to advise them and guide them, in numerous ways, such as the 
    following: 

    Reciting specific verses of Qur'aan, then explaining their 
    meanings after the prayer. 

    Inviting some daa’iyahs and seekers of knowledge to give 
    lectures or lessons on the Sunnah and following it. 

    Distributing leaflets and pamphlets. 

    Setting up an audio library and encouraging people to borrow 
    from it. 

    In all cases, the imam should be knowledgeable, gentle and 
    wise, and above all he should be sincere in his love for people, so that he 
    may be granted divine help and success. 

    Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    was asked: 

    If the people to whom the call (da’wah) is addressed are 
    influenced by a particular culture or society, what is the best way to call 
    them? 

    He replied: 

    The one who is calling them to Allaah should explain to them 
    the mistakes and bid’ahs etc that are present in the ways that they are 
    following and the cultures to which they belong, and the environments in 
    which they live. He should explain to them the things that are contrary to 
    sharee’ah in their societies in which they live, and call them to examine 
    everything about which they are confused against the most just standard, 
    which is the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him). Whatever is in accordance with one or both 
    of them may be regarded as legitimate according to sharee’ah, and whatever 
    goes against them should be rejected, no matter who advocates it. Thus the 
    scholars used to examine controversial matters against the shar’i evidence; 
    whatever is in accordance with sharee’ah must stay, and whatever goes 
    against sharee’ah must be rejected, even if the one who says it is great, 
    because the truth prevails over all. This is what must be done with any 
    customs or traditions that go against sharee’ah; they must be given up, even 
    if they are the traditions of our forefathers, shaykhs, ancestors and so on. 
    Everyone must adhere to that which has been enjoined by Allaah and His 
    Messenger, because that is the path to salvation, as Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And verily, this is My straight path, so follow it, and 
    follow not (other) paths, for they will separate you away from His path. 
    This He has ordained for you that you may become Al‑Muttaqoon (the pious)”

    [al-An’aam 6:153]

     And Allaah is the Source of strength. End quote.

So seek the help of 
    Allaah, and learn from the experience of your fellow imams and be sincere 
    towards those are praying behind you, and you will find much good and be 
    rewarded greatly.",Islam Q&A
