No one can do anything better than what he has done except one who does more than that.

14610,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14610,Angels,Could you give us some information about the angels?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Allah created the angels from light. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The angels were created from light, the jinn were created from smokeless fire, and Adam was created from that which has been described to you.” [Muslim, 2996] 
The angels are by nature obedient to Allah: 
“[they, i.e., angels] disobey not, (from executing) the commands they receive from Allah, but do that which they are commanded.” [66:6 – interpretation of the meaning] 
They are created in such a way that they do not eat or drink. Their food is tasbeeh (glorification of Allah) and tahleel (saying La ilaha ill-Allah), as Allah tells us concerning them (interpretation of the meaning): 
“They (i.e. the angels) glorify His praises night and day, (and) they never slacken (to do so) [21:20] 
The angels bear witness to the Oneness of Allah, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allah bears witness that La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), and the angels, and those having knowledge (also give this witness); (He always) maintains His creation in justice. La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.” [3:18] 
Allah has honoured some of the angels by choosing them as messengers, just as He has chosen some of mankind as messengers: 
“Allah chooses messengers from angels and from men.” [22:75 – interpretation of the meaning] 
When Allah created Adam and He wanted to honour him, He commanded the angels to prostrate to him: 
“And (remember) when We said to the angels: ‘Prostrate yourselves before Adam.’ And they prostrated except Iblis (Satan), he refused and was proud and was one of the disbelievers (disobedient to Allah).’” [2:34 – interpretation of the meaning] 
The angels are a mighty creation, and they perform many tasks, and they are divided into many groups, which no one knows except Allah. Some of them carry the Throne: 
“Those (angels) who bear the Throne (of Allah) and those around it glorify the praises of their Lord, and believe in Him, and ask forgiveness for those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah)…” [40:7 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Among them is the one who brings down the revelation to the messengers. He is Jibreel (peace be upon him), who brought the Quran down to Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): 
“Which the trustworthy Rooh [Jibreel] has brought down
Upon your heart (O Muhammad) that you may be (one) of the warners.” [26:193 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Among them is Mikail, who is appointed in charge of the rain and vegetation, and Israfil who is appointed to blow the Trumpet when the Hour begins. And among them are the recording angels who are appointed to watch over the sons of Adam and their deeds:
“But verily, over you (are appointed angels in charge of mankind) to watch you,
Kiraman (Honourable) Katibeen —writing down (your deeds),
They know all that you do.” [82: 10-12 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Among them are those who are entrusted with the task of writing down all deeds, whether good or evil: 
“(Remember) that the two receivers (recording angels) receive (each human being), one sitting on the right and one on the left (to note his or her actions)
Not a word does he (or she) utter but there is a watcher by him ready (to record it).” [50:17-18 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Among them are those who are entrusted with the task of seizing the souls of the believers:
 “Those whose lives the angels take while they are in a pious state (i.e. pure from all evil, and worshipping none but Allah Alone) saying (to them): Salamun ‘Alaykum (peace be on you) enter you Paradise, because of that (the good) which you used to do (in the world).” [16:32 – interpretation of the meaning] 
And among them are those who are entrusted with the task of seizing the souls of the disbelievers: 
“And if you could see when the angels take away the souls of those who disbelieve (at death); they smite their faces and their backs, (saying): ‘Taste the punishment of the blazing Fire.’” [8:50 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Among them are the gatekeepers of Paradise and the servants of the people of Paradise: 
“And angels shall enter unto them from every gate (saying):
Salamun ‘Alaykum (peace be upon you) for you persevered in patience! Excellent indeed is the final home!” [13:23-24 – interpretation of the meaning] 
And among them are the gatekeepers of Hell: 
“O you who believe! Ward off yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones, over which are (appointed) angels stern (and) severe.” [66:6 – interpretation of the meaning] 
Among them are some who strive in jihad (battle) with the believers: 
“(Remember) when your Lord revealed to the angels, ‘Verily, I am with you, so keep firm those who have believed. I will cast terror into the hearts of those who have disbelieved, so strike them over the necks, and smite over all their fingers and toes.’” [8:12 – interpretation of the meaning] 
On Laylat al-Qadr (Night of Decree) in the month of Ramadan, the angels come down to witness goodness with the Muslims, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The Night of Al-Qadr (Decree) is better than a thousand months (i.e. worshipping Allah in that night is better than worshipping Him a thousand months, i.e. 83 years and 4 months).
Therein descend the angels and the Rooh [Jibreel] by Allah’s permission with all decrees.” [97:3-4] 
The angels do not enter a house in which there is a statue, picture (image) or a dog. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or an image.” [Muslim]. 
Belief in the angels is one of the pillars of faith, and whoever denies it is a kafir (disbeliever): 
“... and whosoever disbelieves in Allah, His angels, His Books, His messengers, and the Last Day, then indeed he has strayed far away.” [4:136 – interpretation of the meaning] 
And Allah knows best.","From Usool al-Deen al-Islami, by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem al-Tuwayjri"

14622,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14622,Is it obligatory to change one's name if its meaning is not good?,Is it obligatory to change one's name if its meaning is not good?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Names have meanings, as the saying goes, and every person is influenced by the meaning of his name. So a person should be given a suitable name that has a good meaning, so that he will be influenced by his name. 
Ibn al-Qayyim said: 
Because names have meanings, it is wise that there should be a proper connection between the meaning of the names and the object that is carrying the name. It should not be the case that the meaning is not suited to the object and there is no connection between the meaning and the object, because this is what is decreed by the Most Wise, and reality testifies to that. Indeed names have a great impact on the objects to which they are applied, and the objects that carry these names will definitely be influenced by these names, whether these names are good or ugly, whether they refer to meanings of lightness or heaviness, kindness or cruelty.” 
Zaad al-Ma’aad, 2/336 
Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to change bad names to good ones. 
It was narrated from Ibn ‘Umar that a daughter of ‘Umar was called ‘Aasiyah (disobedient), but the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) renamed her Jameelah (beautiful). Narrated by Muslim, 2139. 
The ruling – changing names to good names – has to do with what is mustahabb and preferable; it is not obligatory or binding. 
The evidence for that is the report narrated by al-Bukhaari (6190) from Ibn al-Musayyab that his father came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and he said, “What is your name?” He said, “Hazn (meaning rough).” He said, “You are Sahl (meaning easy).” He said, “I will not change the name that my father gave to me.” Ibn al-Musayyab said, “And we have had roughness (in character) ever since.” 
Roughness means being harsh and difficult to deal with. 
Ibn Battaal said: 
This shows that improving names and changing names to something better is not something that is obligatory. 
Fath al-Baari. 
And if it had been obligatory, the Sahaabi would not have refused to change his name, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would have compelled him to change his name. 
And Allaah knows best. 
But if the name carries a meaning implying servitude to someone other than Allaah, such as ‘Abd al-Nabi (slave of the Prophet) and ‘Abd al-Maseeh (slave of the Messiah), and the like, then these names must be changed, because it is not permissible to be a slave of someone other than Allaah, and because all of creation belongs to Allaah and is subjugated to Him. 
Ibn Hazm (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
The scholars are agreed that every name which implies servitude to someone other than Allaah – such as ‘Abd ‘Amr or ‘Abd al-Ka’bah and so on, is haraam.

Al-Bayhaqi (8/324) narrated that Jaabir said: 
    The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did ‘aqeeqah for al-Hasan and al-Husayn, and he circumcised them when 
    they were seven days old.  
The isnaad of this hadeeth is da’eef (weak). 
    See Irwa’ al-Ghaleel, 4/383 
Hence Imam Ahmad was asked about the time of 
    circumcision, and he said, We have not heard anything about that. 
Ibn al-Mundhir said: 
There is no report that may be referred to 
    concerning the time of circumcision, and no Sunnah to be followed. 
With regard to the time when it becomes 
    obligatory: 
Some of the scholars were of the view that it 
    is not obligatory until after puberty, because the duties of sharee’ah are not obligatory until one reaches puberty. 
Al-Nawawi said: 
Our companions said: The time when 
    circumcision becomes obligatory is after puberty. 
Al-Majmoo’, 
    1/351 

    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) favoured the view that it is obligatory before puberty, so that the child will reach puberty in a 
    circumcised state, but the obligation here is upon the guardian, not the child. 
Ibn al-Qayyim said: 
In my view it is obligatory for the guardian 
    to circumcise the child before puberty, so that he will grow up in a circumcised state, because the duty can only be done in this manner… The 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) enjoined fathers to tell their children to pray when they are seven and to smack them if 
    they do not pray when they are ten, so what justification can there be for not circumcising them until after they have reached puberty? 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: 

    With regard to circumcision, whenever he wants he can be circumcised, but if he is approaching the age of puberty he should be circumcised as the  
    Arabs used to do, to make sure he does not reach puberty when he is not circumcised.

14627,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14627,Meaning of maa’ilaat mumeelaat,"What is the meaning of the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in the hadeeth, “maa’ilaat mumeelaat”?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.This is a saheeh hadeeth which was narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh from the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) who said: “There are two types of the people of 
    Hell whom I have not seen: men in whose hands are whips like the tails of cattle, with which they beat the people, and women who are clothed yet 
    naked, maa’ilaat mumeelaat, with their heads like the humps of camels, tilted to one side. They will not enter Paradise nor even smell its 
    fragrance.” This is a stern warning to beware of the things referred to. 
The men in whose hands are whips like the 
    tails of cattle are those who beat the people unjustly, like police and others, whether that is done by order of the state or otherwise. The state 
    is only to be obeyed with regard to matters that are right and proper. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “Obedience is only with regard to what is right and proper.” And he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no obedience 
    to any created being if it involves disobedience towards the Creator.” 
With regard to the phrase “women who are 
    clothed yet naked, maa’ilaat mumeelaat”, the scholars interpreted this as follows: 
“kaasiyat ‘aariyaat (translated above 
    as “clothed yet naked” may have another meaning, which is that they are enjoying the blessings of Allaah, but they do not give thanks for them and 
    they do not obey the commands of Allaah or heed His prohibitions, even though Allaah has bestowed upon them wealth and other blessings.  
The hadeeth is also explained in a different 
    manner, which is that they wear clothes that do not cover them, because they are too thin or too short, so they do not serve the purpose of 
    clothes, hence they are described as naked, and because the clothes they wear do not cover their ‘awrah.  
Maa’ilaat 
    (literally “deviant”) means they turn away from chastity and righteousness, i.e., they commit sins and evil deeds like those who do immoral 
    actions, or they fall short in doing the obligatory duties, prayer etc. 
Mumeelaat means 
    they turn others away, i.e., they call people to evil and corruption, so by their words and actions they lead others into immorality and sin, and 
    they commit immoral actions because of their lack of faith or the weakness of their faith. The point of this saheeh hadeeth is to warn against 
    oppression and all kinds of corruption from men and women. 
With regard to the phrase, “their heads are 
    like the heads of camels, tilted to one side,” some of the scholars said that this means they make their heads look big because of the hairstyles 
    they adopt and so on, so that it looks like the hump of a bakht camel. The bakht is a type of camel that has two humps between which there is a 
    dip, so that one hump leans one way and the other leans the other way. When these woman make their heads look big in this way, they look like 
    these humps. 
With regard to the phrase, “They will not enter Paradise nor even smell its fragrance,” this is 
    a stern warning; it does not necessarily mean that they are kaafirs or that they will abide in Hell forever, like other sinners who die as 
    Muslims; rather what is meant is that they and other sinners are threatened with Hell for their sins, but they are subject to the will of Allaah. 
    If He wills He will forgive them and if He will He will punish them. This is like the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, Allaah forgives not that partners 
    should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He wills”
[al-Nisa’ 4:48]
If a sinner (who is Muslim) enters Hell, he 
    will not abide therein forever like the kuffaar, and those who will abide therein like murderers, adulterers and suicides will not abide therein 
    forever like the kuffaar; rather it is an eternity which will have an end according to Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah – in contrast to the Khawaarij 
    and Mu’tazilah and the innovators who follow their path, because the saheeh mutawaatir ahaadeeth narrated from the Messenger of Allaah  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) indicate that he will intercede for the sinners among his ummah and that Allaah will accept that intercession 
    from him  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) a number of times; each time He will specify a number who are to be brought forth from 
    Hell. Similarly the rest of the Messengers, the believers and the angels will all intercede by Allaah’s leave, and He will accept their 
    intercession for whomsoever He will among the believers in Tawheed who have entered Hell because of their sins but are Muslims. Then there will 
    remain in Hell those sinners who are not included in the intercession of the intercessors, but Allaah will bring them forth by His Mercy and 
    Kindness, and there will be none left in Hell but the kuffaar who will abide therein forever and ever. Allaah says concerning the kuffaar 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“whenever it abates, We shall increase for 
    them the fierceness of the Fire”
[al-Isra’ 17:97]
“So taste you (the results of your evil 
    actions). No increase shall We give you, except in torment”
[al-Naba’ 78:30]
And He says concerning the kuffaar who 
    worshipped idols (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Thus Allaah will show them their deeds as 
    regrets for them. And they will never get out of the Fire”
[al-Baqarah 2:167]
And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, those who disbelieve, if they had 
    all that is in the earth, and as much again therewith to ransom themselves thereby from the torment on the Day of Resurrection, it would never be 
    accepted of them, and theirs would be a painful torment.
They will long to get out of the Fire, but 
    never will they get out therefrom; and theirs will be a lasting torment”

The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah says: ‘I am al-Rahmaan (the Most Merciful) and this rahm (tie of kinship) has a name that is derived from My name. Whoever uphold it, I will take care of him, and whoever severs it, I will cut him off.’” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1907; Abu Dawood, 1694; classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 520). 
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever would like his lifespan to be extended and his provision to be increased, let him uphold the ties of kinship.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1961; Muslim, 2557) 
Among the rights that they share with other Muslims, except that their rights are stronger, are: that you should greet them with salaam when you meet them; you should accept their invitation when they invite you; you should say “Yarhamukum Allaah (may Allaah have mercy on you) if they sneeze; you should visit them if they fall sick; you should attend their funeral if they die; you should go along with them if they swear that you should do something; you should advise them sincerely if they seek your advice; you should not backbite about them in their absence; you should love for them what you love for yourself and hate for them what you hate for yourself. All of that is narrated in saheeh ahaadeeth. 
Their rights also include: that you should not harm any of them in word or deed. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The Muslim is the one from whose tongue and hand the Muslims are safe.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 10; Muslim, 40). And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, in a lengthy hadeeth in which he enjoined a number of virtues, “… If you cannot do that, then leave people alone (and do not offend them), for that is an act of charity that you do for yourself.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2382; Muslim, 84).

Can the Muslims benefit from knowing exactly where it is?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.In fact people differed concerning that. It 
    was said that he is buried in Syria, or in Iraq, and Allaah knows best what is true. With regard to his head, they also differed concerning that; 
    it was said that it is buried in Syria, or in Iraq, or in Egypt. The correct view is that the site in Egypt is not his grave, rather that is a 
    mistake and the head of al-Husayn is not there. A number of scholars have written essays on that and explained that there is no evidence for the 
    head of al-Husayn being in Egypt. The most likely to be correct is the view that it is in Syria, because it was taken to Yazeed ibn Mu’aawiyah who 
    was in Syria. There is no basis for the view that it was taken to Egypt. Either it was kept in Syria or it was returned to his body in Iraq. 
Whatever the case, the people do not need to 
    know where it is buried or where it is. Rather what is prescribed is to pray for forgiveness and mercy for him, may Allaah forgive him and be 
    pleased with him, for he was killed unlawfully. So we should pray for forgiveness and mercy for him, and hope for much good for him. He and his 
    brother al-Hasan will be the leaders of the youth of Paradise, as the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said. May Allaah be 
    pleased with them. 
If a person’s grave is known, there is 
    nothing wrong with saying salaams to him and making du’aa’ for him, as other graves may be visited, without going to extremes in that or 
    worshipping them. It is not permissible to ask the dead to intercede, because nothing can be asked of the dead; rather we should make du’aa’ for 
    them and pray for mercy for them if they were Muslims, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Visit the 
    graves, for they will remind you of the Hereafter.” 
If a person visits the graves of al-Husayn or 
    al-Hasan or any other Muslim to make du’aa’ for them and pray for mercy and forgiveness for them, as he would do at the grave of any other Muslim, 
    this is Sunnah. But visiting graves to pray to their occupants or seek their help or ask them to intercede – this is a reprehensible action, and 
    indeed it is major shirk. It is not permissible to build mosques or domes etc over graves, because the Messenger  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “May Allaah curse the Jews and Christians, for they took the graves of their Prophets as places of worship.” (Saheeh – 
    agreed upon). And because it was narrated from Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him) in al-Saheeh that the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade plastering over graves, sitting on them and erecting structures over them.” So t is not permissible to 
    plaster over graves, perfume them, place screens around them or erect structures over them; all of that is forbidden and these are means that lead 
    to shirk. And we should not pray at graves because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Those who came before you 
    used to take the graves of their Prophets and righteous people as places of worship; do not take graves as places of worship, for I forbid you to 
    do that.” (Narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh from Jundub ibn ‘Abd-Allaah al-Bajali (may Allaah be pleased with him). 
This hadeeth indicates that it is not 
    permissible to pray at graves or to take them as mosques; and because that is a means that leads to shirk and worshipping someone other than 
    Allaah by calling upon them (the occupants of the graves), seeking their help, making vows to them, and touching the graves to seek their 
    blessings. Hence the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) warned against that. Rather graves should be visited in the manner 
    prescribed in sharee’ah only, to give salaams to them and make du’aa’ for them and pray for mercy for them, but without travelling specifically 
    for that purpose.

14632,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14632,He tried to stay overnight in Muzdalifah but was not able to – what is the ruling?,"After the sun set on the day of ‘Arafah, my friend and I set out, each driving a car carrying women and a few men and children, to go from ‘Arafah to Muzdalifah with the other pilgrims. After a portion of the night had passed, but before midnight, we reached Muzdalifah, but they would not let us in to the empty area at the beginning of Muzdalifah… When we reached the middle of Muzdalifah, we could not find empty space, and they expelled us from Muzdalifah. After we left Muzdalifah we were involuntarily separated. My friend went to stone Jamarat al-‘Aqabah and to do Tawaaf al-Ifaadah, since he could not go back to Muzdalifah because he did not know the way back. I followed the roads to Mina, then to Makkah, and thence to ‘Arafah, and we came back to Muzdalifah again at the end of the night, after a lot of exhausting struggle and effort. My questions are: 

1- Do my friend and the people with him have to offer a sacrifice because they did not manage to stay overnight in Muzdalifah although they wanted to – or not?

Does the fact that I spent the night traveling around, with all the difficulties involved, and I did not manage to stay overnight in Muzdalifah as required, and only spent a short part of the night there, mean that I also have to offer a sacrifice?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    If the matter is as you described, then neither of you has to 
    offer a sacrifice for not staying overnight in Muzdalifah, and neither do 
    the pilgrims who were with you, because you tried your hardest to stay there 
    overnight but you were not able to do so. Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meanings): 

    “Allaah burdens not a person beyond his scope”

    [al-Baqarah 2:286] 

    “Allaah does not want to place you in difficulty”

    [al-Maa’idah 5:6]

    “So keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you 
    can”

    [al-Taghaabun 64:14]
But for those who stoned 
    Jamarat al-‘Aqabah and did Tawaaf al-Ifaadah and Sa’ee before midnight, that 
    is not acceptable; they have to repeat the Tawaaf, Sa’ee’ and Ramiy 
    (stoning). There is no set time limit for repeating the Tawaaf and Sa’ee, 
    but they should hasten to do it once they know the ruling. With regard to 
    the Ramiy the one who misses it must offer a sacrifice if he did not repeat 
    it during the four days spent in Mina, the day of ‘Eid and the three days of 
    al-Tashreeq. If it was done after midnight it is acceptable and there is no 
    sin on you for that, in sha Allaah. You will be rewarded for your efforts 
    and for the difficulty you endured. 

    And Allaah is the Source of strength. May Allaah send blessings and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and 
    companions.","Al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah li’l-Buhooth al-‘Ilmiyyah wa’l-Iftaa’ – Fataawa al-Lajnah, 11/202"
