Before I accepted Islam I committed adultery an conceived a child with a married 
woman. The woman's husband has been told the truth and is aware that the child is 
not his, but he still wants to keep the child and his wife. Her husband wants to have 
nothing to do with me(understandably) and wishes that I keep away from my son 
who I have rarely seen and he does not know who I am. The child is almost 3 years 
old and I have been a Muslim for almost 2 years. 
What is the Islamic ruling in such a case? Can I consider the child to be mine?
The husband and his wife are both kaffirs.",,,"Praise be to Allah.All Praises are Due 
  to Allah
Islam erases whatever 
  took place before it and after Allah guides you there is no sin on you, regarding 
  something which took place in the past. The rule according to the Shariah (Islamic 
  Laws) is that the child is to the bed and follows the husband, unless he washes 
  his hands of the matter.
The child in not 
  considered to be your son, nor do you have any responsibility for him. So start 
  a married life according to Islam.

  you and increase you in protection.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

Everyone who is in charge of orphans’ property has to dispose of it in the manner which he thinks is in the orphans’ best interests. With regard to that which is not in their interests, or which serves some interest but there is some doubt as to whether it is in their best interests, then it is not permissible to dispose of it in that manner, because of the quotation mentioned (interpretation of the meaning):

1226,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1226,Sighting the moon not following astronomical calculations,"There is a big dispute among Muslim scholars concerning the timing of the beginning of Ramadaan and ‘Eid al-Fitr. Some of them act upon the sighting of the new moon, because of the hadeeth, “Fast when you sight it [the new moon] and stop fasting when you sight it…”; others rely on the calculations of astronomers, saying that these scientists have progressed so far in the science of astronomy that they are able to know when the lunar month begins. Who is right in this matter?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: the correct opinion which must be acted upon is that indicated by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Fast when you see it [the new moon] and stop fasting when you see it, and if it is cloudy then complete the month with thirty days.” That is the basis for determining the beginning and end of Ramadaan by the actual sighting of the new moon. The Islamic sharee’ah with which Allaah sent our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is universal and everlasting, until the Day of Resurrection. (It is valid for every time and place, whether worldly sciences are advanced or otherwise, whether there are telescopes etc. or not, whether there are any people in the population who are able to do astronomical calculations or not. Sighting the moon is something that people of all places and times can do, unlike calculations which may or may not be within the reach of the people, and telescopes which may or may not be available)
Secondly: Allaah knew what progress would be made in astronomy and other sciences, but despite that He still said (interpretation of the meaning): “… So whoever among you sights (the crescent on the first night of) the month (of Ramadaan), he must observe sawm (fast) that month…” [al-Baqarah 2:185] and the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Fast when you see it [the new moon] and stop fasting when you see it…” So the beginning and ending of Ramadaan are connected to the actual sighting of the moon, and not to the calculations of astronomers, even though Allaah knew that the astronomers would develop their science to the point where they would be able to calculate the positions of the stars and heavenly bodies. The Muslims are obliged to follow what Allaah has prescribed for them through His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), basing the beginning and end of the fast on the sighting of the moon. This is like the consensus of the scholars, whoever differs with this and relies on calculations is shaadhdh (“odd”) and his opinion cannot be relied on.

1239,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1239,The wisdom behind the creation of dangerous animals,What is The wisdom behind the creation of dangerous animals ?,,,"Praise be to Allah.There are two aspects to the answer to this question: general and specific. The general answer is that the Muslim believes that Allah is All-Wise and All-Knowing, and He does not create anything in vain; all of His actions are based on Wisdom. If the wisdom behind any of His actions is hidden from the believer, then he should still adhere to this principle, and not think of his Lord in bad terms. 
The specific answer is that the wisdom behind the creation of these things is to manifest the perfect nature of Allah’s creation and control of all things. Even though the created things are so many, He provides for them all. He also tests people by means of these  (dangerous creatures), rewards those who are afflicted by them and makes manifest the bravery of those who kill them. By creating them, He tests His slaves’ faith and certainty: the believer accepts the matter and submits, whilst the doubter says, “What is the point of Allah creating this?!” He also demonstrates the weakness and incapability of man, whereby he suffers pain and sickness because of a creature which is far smaller than he is. One of the scholars was asked about the wisdom behind the creation of flies. He said, so that Allah may humiliate the noses of the tyrants with them. Because of the existence of harmful creatures, it becomes apparent how great is the blessing in the creation of beneficial things, as it is said that contrast with the opposite demonstrates the nature of things. The study of medicine has demonstrated that many beneficial drugs are derived from the venom of snakes and the like. Glory be to the One Who has created benefits in things that to all outward appearances are harmful. Moreover, many of these dangerous animals are food for other creatures which are beneficial, and this forms the ecological cycle in the environments where Allah has created them.
 But the Muslim has to believe that everything that Allah does is good, and that there is no pure evil in what He creates. In everything that He creates there has to be some aspect of good, even if it is hidden from us, as is the case with the creation of Iblees, who is the head of evil. But there is wisdom and a purpose behind his creation, for Allah tests His creatures by means of him, to distinguish the obedient from the disobedient, those who strive from those who are negligent, the people of Paradise from the people of Hell.

1244,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1244,What Happens to Those Who Never Heard of Islam?,"Someone has asked me this question (she is about to become a muslimah). Her statement: 'A lot of others will never meet a Muslim in person. Will they be held responsible for their ignorance? What exactly does this mean: ""After the revelation of the Quran whoever receives this message & does not abide by it is a non-believer""?
i. Who is considered to have received the message?
ii. Isn't it possible for people to have not received the message even though the Quran is in existence?'","Whoever dies without having heard the message or having heard it in a distorted form, then his case is in the Hands of Allah Who Knows best about His creation, and He will never treat anyone unfairly.",,"Praise be to Allah.It is part of the justice of Allah that He does not punish any people until He has first sent a warning to them and unless there is evidence against them. Allah does not treat anybody unfairly. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger (to give warning).” [Al-Isra 17:15]
In his Tafsir (commentary) on this verse, Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“These words, ‘And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger (to give warning)’ tell us of the justice of Allah, may He be Exalted, and that He does not punish anyone until after He has established evidence against him by sending a Messenger to him. This is like the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “Every time a group is cast therein [into Hell], its keeper will ask, Did no warner come to you? They will say, Yes indeed; a warner did come to us, but we belied him and said: Allah never sent down anything (of revelation), you are only in great error.” [Al-Mulk 67:8] and: “And those who disbelieved will be driven to Hell in groups, till, when they reach it, the gates thereof will be opened (suddenly like a prison at the arrival of its prisoners). And its keepers will say, Did not the Messengers come to you from yourselves, - reciting to you the Verses of your Lord, and warning you of the Meeting of this Day of yours? They will say: Yes, but the Word of torment has been justified against the disbelievers!” [Al-Zumar 39:71]
A person who has never heard of Islam or the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and who has never heard the message in its correct and true form, will not be punished by Allah if he dies in a state of disbelief . 
If it were asked what his fate will be, the answer will be that Allah will test him on the Day of Resurrection: if he obeys, he will enter Paradise and if he disobeys he will enter Hell. The evidence for this is the Hadith of Al-Aswad ibn Sari` (may Allah be pleased with him), who reported that the Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: There are four (who will protest) to Allah on the Day of Resurrection: the deaf man who never heard anything, the insane man, the very old man, and the man who died during the Fatrah (the interval between the time of `Isa (Jesus, upon whom be peace) and the time of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)). The deaf man will say, O Lord, Islam came but I never heard anything. The insane man will say, O Lord, Islam came but the children ran after me and threw stones at me. The very old man will say, O Lord, Islam came but I did not understand anything. The man who died during the Fatrah will say, O Lord, no Messenger from You came to me. He will accept their promises of obedience, then word will be sent to them to enter the Fire. By the One in Whose Hand is the soul of Muhammad, if they enter it, it will be cool and safe for them.
According to another report, he said: “Whoever enters it, it will be cool and safe for him, and whoever does not enter it will be dragged to it.” (The Hadith was reported by Imam Ahmad and Ibn Hibban, and classed as authentic by Al-Albani, Sahih Al-Jami, 881)
Everyone who hears the message of Islam in a sound and correct form (and rejects it), will have evidence against him. Whoever dies without having heard the message or having heard it in a distorted form, then his case is in the hands of Allah. Allah knows best about His creation, and He will never treat anyone unfairly. And Allah is All-Seer of His slaves.

1245,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1245,"It is permissible to use telescopes etc., but not calculations, to sight the new moon","It is not possible to see the new moon with the naked eye before it is 30 hours old, and in addition to that, it is sometimes not possible to see it at all because of the weather conditions. On this basis, is it permissible to resort to using astronomical information to calculate the likely time for sighting the new moon and the start of Ramadan, or do we have to actually sight the new moon before we start fasting the blessed month of Ramadan?",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is permissible to use telescopes etc. to sight the moon, but it is not permissible to rely on astronomical data to confirm the beginning or end of the blessed month of Ramadan, because Allah has not prescribed that for us in His Book or in the Sunnah of His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). What He has prescribed for us is to confirm the beginning and end of Ramadan by sighting the new moon of Ramadan to start fasting, and the new moon of Shawwaal to end the fast and gather to offer the Eid prayers. Allah has made the new moons to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the Hajj, so it is not permissible for Muslims to use any other method to determine the times for acts of worship such as fasting, celebrating Eid, performing Hajj, fasting for two months as expiation (kafaarah) for killing someone by mistake or divorcing one’s wife by zihaar, and so on. Allah says (interpretation of the meanings):
“… So whoever among you sights (the crescent on the first night of) the month (of Ramadan), he must observe sawm (fast) that month…” [al-Baqarah 2:185]
“They ask you (O Muhammad) about the new moons. Say: these are signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the pilgrimage…” [al-Baqarah 2:189]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Fast when you see it [the new moon] and stop fasting when you see it, and if it is cloudy then complete the month with thirty days.” On this basis, the one who does not see the new moon from the time it rises on a clear or cloudy night must complete the month (of Sha’baan) with thirty days.
(Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 10/100). This is the case if the sighting of the new moon is not confirmed in another country; if the moon is sighted according to the guidelines of Sharee’ah, then fasting is obligatory, according to the majority of scholars.

1248,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1248,"Do different times of moonrise matter, and what should Muslim communities in the West do","Since the prophet said ""Begin fasting after sighting the moon"", how can muslims be fasting one on Tuesday in one part of the world and wednesday in another part. We should all begin our fast at the same time regardless of where we live.
We are students in the U.S. and Canada, and we face the same problem every year at the beginning of Ramadan, because the Muslims are split into three groups:A group that fasts when the new moon is sighted in the city in which they live.
A group that fasts when fasting starts in Saudi Arabia.
A group that fasts when they hear news from the Muslim students’ union in the U.S. and Canada which watches for the new moon in different parts of America, and as soon as the new moon is sighted in one city, they spread the news to different Islamic centres so that the Muslims in America can start fasting on the same day, despite the great distances between the different cities.
Which group should we follow? Whose sighting of the moon should we rely on? Please give us a fatwa, may Allah reward you.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: the fact that the moon rises at different times in different places is a well-established fact; no scholar disputes this. However, the scholars differ as to whether this matters or not.
Secondly: the question as to whether different times of moonrise is something that matters is a theoretical question in which ijtihaad is permissible. Those who have knowledge of science and religion differ on this matter, and this difference of opinion is permissible; the one who has the correct opinion will have two rewards, one for being right and one for making ijtihaad; the one whose opinion is wrong will still be rewarded for his ijtihaad.
The scholars’ differences on this matter may be described as one of two: some of them thought that the differences in the times of the moon’s rising was of significance, and others thought that it was not. Both groups cite evidence from the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and maybe even quote the same text, such as the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): “They ask you (O Muhammad) about the new moons. Say: these are signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the pilgrimage…” [al-Baqarah 2:189] and the hadeeth, “Fast when you see it [the new moon] and stop fasting when you see it…” The difference is one of interpretation of the texts, as each group has its own methods of deriving evidence.
Thirdly: the committee has looked at the issue of confirming the new moon by calculations and what was said on this matter in the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and they have studied the opinions of the scholars on this matter. They decided unanimously that astronomical calculations do not count when it comes to confirming the new moon for shar'i purposes, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Fast when you see it [the new moon] and stop fasting when you see it…” and also: “Do not fast until you see it [the new moon] and do not stop fasting until you see it…”, and because of the evidence that is derived from these ahaadeeth.
The Standing Committee on Scientific Research and Fatwas (al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah li’l-Buhooth al-‘Ilmiyyah wa’l-Iftaa’) thinks that the Muslim students’ union (or any other group representing the Muslim community) in countries where the government is not Islamic should take the place of an Islamic government in the matter of confirming the new moon for the people living in those non-Islamic countries.
On the basis of the above, this union has the choice of two options: either to consider the differences in times of moonrise to be of significance, or not to do so. Then they should inform all the Muslims in their country what their opinion is, and the Muslims have to follow what they have been told, so as to unite the Muslims in their fasting and to put an end to disputes and confusion. Everyone who lives in those countries should try to sight the moon in the place where they are living, and if one or more trustworthy persons sight the moon, they should fast according to that and tell the union to spread the news. This is at the beginning of Ramadan; at the end of the month there has to be two witnesses to see the new moon of Shawwaal or the completion of thirty days of Ramadan, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Fast when you see it [the new moon] and stop fasting when you see it, and if it is cloudy then complete the month with thirty days.”

Know that the ahaadeeth that have been narrated about him in various reports are numerous."" He also said: ""You know that the ahaadeeth which speak of the Mahdi, his appearance at the end of time, and his lineage and descent from the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) via Faatimah reach the level of tawaatur in meaning, so there is no point in denying them.""
 
3. Al-Allaamah Muhammad al-Safaareeni said: ""There are so many reports which speak of the appearance of the Mahdi that they reach the level of tawaatur in meaning; they are very popular among the scholars of Sunnah and have become part of their faith."" Then he quotes a number of ahaadeeth and reports about the appearance of the Mahdi and the names of the Sahaabah from whom they were narrated: ""Many reports were narrated from the Sahaabah whose names were mentioned and others whose names were not mentioned, may Allah be pleased with them all, and from the Taabieen after them, all of which proves that this is definitive knowledge. Belief in the appearance of the Mahdi is obligatory, as it has been confirmed by the scholars and is listed among the beliefs of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaaah.""
 
4. Al-Allaamah al-Mujtahid al-Shawkaani said: ""The ahaadeeth that we have come across that speak of the awaited Mahdi reach the level of tawaatur, including fifty saheeh, hasan and daeef munjabar ahaadeeth. There are mutawaatir without a doubt; indeed they are more mutawaatir than others, according to all the standards of usool. There are also many reports from the Sahaabah that speak about the Mahdi and that reach the level of marfoo, so there is no room for individual opinions in such an issue.""
 
5. Al-Allaamah al-Shaykh Siddeeq Hasan Khaan said: ""Even though there are different versions of reports concerning the Mahdi, they are so many that they reach the level of tawaatur in meaning. They are to be found in al-Sunan and other books of Islam.""
 
6. Al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Jafar al-Kattaani said: ""The conclusion is that the ahaadeeth narrated concerning the Mahdi are mutawaatir, as are the ahaadeeth concerning the Dajjaal and the descent of Eesaa ibn Maryam, upon whom be peace."" (See Ashraat al-Saaah by Yoosuf ibn Abdullaah al-Waabil, pp. 195-203).
 
You should be aware that some liars have fabricated ahaadeeth about the Mahdi, and others have even claimed to be he, or that he belongs to a group other than Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaaah. Some of these ""false mahdis"" have tried to deceive the slaves of Allah for some worldly gain and to distort the picture of Islaam. Some have started movements and revolutions and gathered those people and supporters whom they were able to deceive. Then they were destroyed, and their lies and falsehood were exposed. None of this affects the belief of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaaah in the Mahdi, upon whom be peace, and that he will undoubtedly appear and rule the earth in accordance with Islamic Shareeah.

Are prayers not accepted if the Imam reads from Quran during Tarawih prayers?,,,"Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with reading from the Mus-haf during night prayers in Ramadan, because this will make the members of the congregation hear all of the Quran. The Quran and Sunnah indicate that Quran should be recited in prayer, whether it is from the Mus-haf or from memory. It was proven that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) told her freed slave Dhakwaan to lead her in praying qiyaam in Ramadan, and he used to read from the Mus-haf.

1263,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1263,Advice to an imaam who shaves his beard,"In our centre we pray salat'u tarewea but one of the boy's who 
actas a Immam used to trim his beard inspite that he is good 
reciter of quran and also has a good voice.
1. The question is shall we allow him to act as imam beside 
that there is the altenative of boys who can act as imam.
2. My wife is preganent in our second months she can only 
fast few days what shall I do to rectify her due days which she 
didn't fast.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
  If your imaam shaves his beard, then you should advise him to let it grow, in 
  adherence to the Sunnah of the Prophet  (peace and 
  blessings of Allaah be upon him). If he refuses, then ask someone else who can 
  recite Qur'aan well, even if he has not memorized as much or does not have as 
  beautiful a voice. If you cannot find anyone but this man who can recite well, 
  then let him lead the prayers, but keep advising him. May Allaah guide him to 
  follow the sunnah and become a leader who sets the right example.
  One of the scholars was asked the following question: We are led in prayer by 
  a man who shaves his beard. Are we permitted to pray behind him or not?
  He answered: If this man who shaves his beard is the official permanent imaam 
  in a mosque, you should try to replace him with someone better, and look for 
  someone who is righteous and qualified, and free of this sin, who could be appointed 
  as the imaam. If he is an imaam who always leads the prayers in an office or 
  school, leading zuhr prayers during work hours, then first of all you should 
  advise him of how abhorrent his action is. If he then persists, then try to 
  find someone else who does not have this fault, even if he is less skilled in 
  recitation. But if this is a situation where he is leading the prayers only 
  once, then there is nothing wrong with praying behind him if he goes forward 
  to lead the prayer and you cannot find anyone better than him. In general, such 
  a prayer should be good enough, in sha Allaah, but you should know that you 
  have to advise him and every other Muslim who falls into the error of committing 
  this sin or others.

1277,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/1277,If a Muslim moves    to another country during Ramadan,"What should a Muslim do if he moves from one country to another during Ramadan, where the people started fasting on a different day?",,,"Praise be to Allah.If a person finds himself in a country where the people have already started fasting, he must fast with them, because he must follow the ruling of the country he is in. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Fast when the people fast, break your fast when the people break their fast, and offer your sacrifice when the people offer their sacrifice.”
(Reported by Abu Dawood with a jayyid isnaad; there are corroborating reports narrated by Abu Dawood and others).
Suppose that he moved from a country where he had begun fasting with the people there, and went to another country. He has to either break his fast or continue fasting according to the ruling of the people in the country to which he has travelled, even if they end their fast earlier than the country where he started fasting. But if it turns out that he has fasted less than twenty-nine days, he must make up the fasts later on, because the hijri month cannot be less than twenty-nine days.","(Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 10/124)"
