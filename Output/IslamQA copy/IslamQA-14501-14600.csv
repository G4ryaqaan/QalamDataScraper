14506,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14506,Praying in a room at the edge of which is a toilet,"I live in a non-Muslim country and find some difficulty when the time of prayer comes while I am outside home as there are not always nearby mosques everywhere you go. A lot of sisters (including myself) have no solution but to pray in the fitting rooms of the shops, or sometimes in the nursing rooms where mums change the nappies for their babies. The problem is that sometimes these nursing rooms have a special section (a corner in the room) where there is a toilet for children. Is it OK to pray there away from the toilet, or is it still considered a ""Najis"" place? Also can a muslim woman pray in an open park or car parking? I do not feel shy about my religion and I do not care about people seeing me, but I sometimes feel shy when non-muslims stand and stare as if you are doing a show! I am also worried that it could be haraam for a muslim woman to pray in front of men.We try to avoid these situations as much as we can, but sometimes we cannot. What should a sister do in these situations?",,,"Praise be to Allah.It was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that it is haraam to pray in certain places, including bathrooms. It is not permissible to pray in them. It was narrated in a saheeh report from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that he said: “All the earth is a mosque except for graveyards and bathrooms.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, al-Salaah, 291; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 262). “Bathroom” refers to every place that is used for the purpose of relieving oneself; it is not permissible to pray in any such place. This room on the edge of which there is a toilet is not considered to be a bathroom so long as there is a barrier between it and the bathroom, with a wall and door etc. In this case prayer in that room is valid, because the prohibition on praying in bathrooms is because they are usually naajis (impure), and this room is not like that. And Allah knows best. 
What indicates that prayer in this place and elsewhere is valid is the hadeeth in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The earth has been made a place of prayer and a means of purification for me, so wherever a man is when the time for prayer comes, let him pray.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, al-Tayammum, 323). So prayer in that place is valid, and it is also valid in parks and parking lots, on condition that the place in which one prays is taahir (pure, clean). 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked, if there is a bathroom in front of a person in the direction of the qiblah, is it o.k. to pray facing it? He said: The prayer is valid and there is nothing wrong with that, rather what is forbidden is to pray inside the bathroom. 
See Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baz, vol. 2, p. 196. 
One thing to which attention must be paid is that a woman should uncover her face when praying, especially when she is among other women or her mahrams. But if she is praying in a place where men can see her, then she should cover her face whilst praying. See the answer to question no. 21803. 
Secondly: you will be rewarded, in sha Allah, for your keenness to do the prayers on time. Undoubtedly the Muslim is obliged to do the prayers on time. And you have to make yourself feel that you are obeying Allah when you are praying. 
Your adherence to the truth and your establishing prayer and not feeling shy to worship openly may be the means of guiding some of the non-Muslims who see you to Islam, in which case you will have a reward equal to theirs in sha Allah. 
May Allah help us and you to do all that is good.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

    touched the hand of any [non-mahram] woman, and he used to accept their oath of allegiance in words only.” 
It makes no difference whether shaking hands is done with a barrier in between or no barrier, 
    because of the general meaning of the evidence, and so as to block the means that may lead to fitnah.

The bed spreads might contain some sexual fluids. My question is should we change it every time that happens. We do change it now. But the problem is we are in a joint family (living with parents & brother) and it's kind of awkward to keep changing it often and washing the dirty ones.
Should we change the dirty ones? What happens when one sits on that? Should he or she do Ghusl or wudu to become clean again?","If what gets on the bedclothes is Mani (sperm) that is not mixed with any other secretions, then you do not have to wash the bedclothes. But if what gets onto the bedclothes is Madhi (prostatic fluid) or some other secretion that comes from the private parts of the man or the woman, then you must only wash the spot where this fluid got onto the bed.",,"Praise be to Allah.If the fluid which is emitted is as a result of foreplay and what gets on the bedclothes is Mani (sperm) that is not mixed with any other secretions, then you do not have to wash the bedclothes because Mani is pure according to the correct scholarly opinion. 
But if what gets onto the bedclothes is Madhi (prostatic fluid) or some other secretion that comes from the private parts of the man or the woman, then you must only wash the spot where this fluid got onto the bed, because these secretions are regarded as impure. 
With regard to doing Ghusl , this is required in two cases: 
·         When intercourse takes place, which is when the entire glans (tip of the penis) enters the woman’s vagina, even if he does not ejaculate. In this case Ghusl is required of both the man and the woman, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When (the man) sits between the thighs and calves of a woman and the two circumcised parts touch, then Ghusl is obligatory.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 291 and Muslim, 349). According to a report narrated by Muslim, “… even if he does not ejaculate.” 
·         When sperm is emitted without intercourse. If a man or woman reaches climax, then Ghusl is obligatory. If the man reaches climax but the woman does not or vice versa, then Ghusl is obligatory because of what has been emitted from them, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“If you are in a state of Janabah (i.e. after a sexual discharge), purify yourselves (bathe your whole body).” [Al-Ma'idah 5:6]
Ghusl becomes obligatory when something is emitted or climax is reached, even if intercourse does not take place, and it becomes obligatory when intercourse takes place even if there is no ejaculation or climax, and it becomes obligatory when both take place together.

Are women allowed to follow the funeral procession?


Are women allowed to visit the graves?","Praise be to Allah.Can women offer funeral prayer?
Praying the janazah (funeral) prayer is prescribed for both men and women . The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever attends the janazah until he offers the prayer will have one qirat (of reward), and whoever attends until (the deceased) is buried will have two qirats.” It was said, “O Messenger of Allah, what are the two qirats?” He said, “Like two great mountains,” meaning, of reward. (Sahih – agreed upon)
Are women allowed to follow the funeral procession?
But women should not follow the funeral procession to the graveyard, because they are not allowed to do that. It was reported in al-Sahihayn that Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “We were forbidden to follow the funeral procession but it was not made absolute on us.” (Muslim)
But women are not forbidden to offer the janazah prayer, whether it is offered in the mosque, in a house or in a prayer-place. Women used to offer the janazah prayer with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in his mosque and after his lifetime. 
Are women allowed to visit the graves?
Visiting graves , however, is something which is only for men, as is following the funeral procession. The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed women who visit graves. The reason for that – and Allah knows best – is that there is the fear that if women were to follow funeral processions to the graveyard or visit graves , that would cause fitnah (temptation) to others or to themselves. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “I have not left behind any fitnah more harmful to men than women.” (Sahih – agreed upon). And Allah is the Source of strength.

14525,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14525,Will We See Allah in Jannah?,Is it proven that the believers will see their Lord in the Hereafter?,,"Proof for seeing Allah in Jannah from the Quran


Proof for seeing Allah in Jannah from the Sunnah","Praise be to Allah.Proof for seeing Allah in Jannah from the Quran
The blessings which Allah bestows upon His slaves cannot be counted. Allah has singled out the believers for additional blessings in this world, as He has blessed them with Islam, and chosen them to be guided by the Quran, and He will bless them in Paradise with the greatest special blessing that He can bestow upon them, which is the honour of seeing His holy Face in the Paradise of `Adan , as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Some faces that Day shall be shining (and radiant). Looking at their Lord (Allah).” [Al-Qiyamah :22-23]
I.e., the faces of the believers will be beautiful and radiant, joyful because they are looking at the Face of their Lord. Al-Hasan (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “They will look at their Lord and their faces will become radiant with His Light.” 
Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “[The phrase] ‘Some faces that Day shall be shining (and radiant)’ means, because of the blessing. ‘Looking at their Lord’ means, looking upon the Face of their Lord.”  This is the opinion of the scholars who interpreted the Quran among the scholars of the Sunnah and Hadith. 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):  
“They will have all that they desire and We have more.” [Qaaf 50:35]
What is meant by “more” here is looking upon the Face of Allah, may He be Glorified and Exalted, as that was interpreted by `Ali and Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with them). 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“For those who have done good is the best reward and even more.” [Yunus 10:26]
The “best reward” is Paradise, and “even more” is looking upon the Face of Allah, as explained by the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), in the narration by Muslim in (266) from Suhayb (may Allah be pleased with him), according to whom the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: 
“When the people of Paradise enter Paradise, Allah will say, ‘Do you want anything more?’ They will say, ‘Have You not brightened our faces, admitted us to Paradise, and saved us from Hell?’ Then the veil will be lifted and they will not have seen anything dearer to them than looking upon their Lord, may He be Glorified and Exalted. This is what is meant by ‘even more.’” Then he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) recited the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“For those who have done good is the best reward and even more .” [Yunus 10:26]
So, once you know that the people of Paradise will not be given anything there that is dearer to them than looking upon the Face of their Lord, it will become clear to you just how great is the deprivation and loss that awaits the sinners whom Allah warns with the words (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Nay! Surely, they (evil doers) will be veiled from seeing their Lord that Day.” [Al-Mutafiffun 83:15]
We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound 
How beautiful are the words of Ash-Shafi`i, which were narrated from him by Ar-Rabi` ibn Sulayman – who was one of his students – who said: “I was with Muhammad ibn Idris [i.e., Ash-Shafi`i], who had received a letter from Upper Egypt in which it said, ‘What do you say about the verse,  
“Nay! Surely, they (evil doers) will be veiled from seeing their Lord that Day.” [Al-Mutafiffun 83:15]
Ash-Shafi`i said: “Because they will be veiled by the wrath (of Allah), this indicates that the allies of Allah will see Him because He is pleased with them.’” 
This is some of the evidence from the Quran which proves that the believers will see their Lord in Paradise . 
Proof for seeing Allah in Jannah from the Sunnah
With regard to the evidence in the Sunnah, there is a great deal of it. For example: 

Al-Bukhari (6088) and Muslim (267) narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that some people said: “O Messenger of Allah, will we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection?” The Messenger of Allah said, “Do you doubt that you see the moon on the night when it is full?” They said, “No, O Messenger of Allah.” He said, “Do you doubt that you see the sun when there is no cloud?” They said, “No, O Messenger of Allah.” He said, “You will see Him likewise.” 

According to a report narrated by Al-Bukhari:  “you will not have any doubts or disputes concerning seeing Him,” and seeing Him will not cause you any hardship or make you tired. And Allah knows best. Summarised from Sharh Muslim. 

Also in Al-Bukhari (6883) and Muslim (1002), it is narrated that Jarir ibn ‘Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “We were sitting with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), looking at the moon on the night of the fourteenth (of the month). He said, ‘You will see your Lord with your own eyes just as you are looking at this (moon), without any doubt that you are seeing Him.’” 

The comparison in this Hadith is between seeing and seeing, i.e., just as we see the sun in all clarity on a cloudless day, and no one prevents anyone else from seeing it despite the large numbers of people looking at it, and just as we see the moon completely on the night when it is full, and we see it so clearly, despite the large numbers of people who are looking at it, so too the believers will see their Lord on the Day of Resurrection, so fully and clearly. But there is no comparison in the Hadiths between what is seen in one case and the other, may Allah be exalted far above such a thing, for there is nothing like unto Allah, and He is the All-Hearing, All-Seeing. 

Al-Bukhari (4500) and Muslim (6890) narrated from Abu Musa (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Two gardens of silver, their vessels and everything in them, and two gardens of gold, their vessels and everything in them. And there will be nothing preventing the people from seeing their Lord, may He be blessed and exalted, except the veil of pride concealing His Face in the Paradise of `Adan.” 

The Hadiths about seeing Allah were narrated by nearly thirty Companions. So whoever claims after this that no one will see Allah in the Hereafter is rejecting the Quran and the message with which Allah sent His Messengers, and he is exposing himself to the stern warning mentioned in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Nay! Surely, they (evil doers) will be veiled from seeing their Lord that Day.” [Al-Mutafiffun 83:15]
We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound, and we ask Him to bestow upon us the joy of seeing His holy Face…. Amen.

14526,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14526,Paradise and Hell exist and they will abide so long as Allaah wills them to abide,Do Paradise and Hell exist at present? Or have they not been created yet?,,,"Praise be to Allah.The scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah are agreed that Paradise and Hell are two created things that exist at present. None of them doubt that because of the volume of evidence from the Qur’aan and Sunnah which indicates that. 
From the Qur’aan: 
Allah says (interpretation of the meanings): 
“[Paradise] prepared for Al-Muttaqoon (the pious)” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:133] 
“Race with one another in hastening towards forgiveness from your Lord (Allah), and Paradise the width whereof is as the width of the heaven and the earth, prepared for those who believe in Allah and His Messengers”[al-Hadeed 57:21] 
“And indeed he (Muhammad) saw him [Jibreel (Gabriel)] at a second descent (i.e. another time).
Near Sidrat-ul-Muntaha (a lote tree of the utmost boundary over the seventh heaven beyond which none can pass).
Near it is the Paradise of Abode”[al-Najm 53:13-15]
Allah says concerning Hell (interpretation of the meaning): 
“prepared for the disbelievers”[al-Baqarah 2:24]
The word prepared indicates that they exist at present. 
From the Sunnah: 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw Sidrat al-Muntaha (a lote tree of the utmost boundary over the seventh heaven beyond which none can pass), by which he saw the Paradise of Abode, as it says in Saheeh al-Bukhaari (336) and Saheeh Muslim (237) who narrated the hadeeth of Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) which tells the story of the Isra’ (Prophet’s Night Journey). At the end of this hadeeth it says: “Jibraa’eel took me until we reached Sidrat al-Muntaha, which was covered with colours, I do not know what they are. Then I entered Paradise and saw that its domes were pearls and its soil was musk.” 
In al-Bukhaari (1290) and Muslim (5111) it is narrated from the hadeeth of ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When any one of you dies, he is shown his place morning and evening. If he is one of the people of Paradise, then he is one of the people of Paradise, and if he is one of the people of Hell, then he is one of the people of Hell, and he is told, ‘This is your abode until Allah raises you on the Day of Resurrection.” 
According to the lengthy hadeeth of al-Baraa’ ibn ‘Aazib, “A voice will call out from heaven, ‘My slave spoke the truth, so provide him with furnishings from Paradise and open for him a door to Paradise so that its fragrant breeze may reach him.’” This is a saheeh hadeeth which was classed as such by Ibn al-Qayyim in Tahdheeb al-Sunan (4/337) and by al-Albaani in Ahkaam al-Janaa’iz (59). 
In Saheeh al-Bukhaari (993) and Saheeh Muslim (1512), it is narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The sun was eclipsed at the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)… and he said: ‘I saw Paradise and I reached out for a bunch of its fruits. If I had managed to take it you would have eaten from it for as long as the earth remains. And I saw Hell, and I have never seen anything more terrifying than it…” 
In Saheeh Muslim (646) it is narrated from the hadeeth of Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “By the One is Whose hand is my soul, if you had seen what I have seen, you would laugh little and weep much.” They said,  “What have you seen, O Messenger of Allah?” He said, “I have seen Paradise and Hell.” 
In Sunan al-Tirmidhi (2483) and elsewhere it is narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:  “When Allah created Paradise and Hell, he sent Jibreel to Paradise and said, ‘Look at it and at what I have prepared for its people therein.’ So he went and looked at it and at what Allah had prepared for its people therein. Then he went back to Him and said, ‘By Your Glory, no one will hear of it but he will enter it.’ Then He commanded that it should be surrounded with difficult things. Then He said, ‘Go back and look at what I have prepared for its people therein.’ He went back and saw that it was surrounded with difficult things. He came back and said, ‘By Your Glory, I am afraid that no one will enter it.’ Allah said, ‘Go and look at Hell and see what I have prepared for its people therein.’  [He saw it] with parts of it consuming other parts. He came back and said, ‘By Your Glory, no one who hears of it will enter it.’ So Allah commanded that it should be surrounded with desires. Then he said, ‘Go back to it.’ So he went back, then he said, ‘By Your Glory, I am afraid that no one will be saved from it and that all will enter it.’” Al-Tirmidhi said: this is a saheeh hasan hadeeth. Al-Haafiz said in al-Fath (6/320): its isnaad is qawiy (strong). 
And there are very many ahaadeeth on this topic. In his Saheeh, al-Bukhaari wrote a chapter entitled Baab ma jaa’a fi Sifat al-Jannah wa annaha makhlooqah (Chapter on what was narrated concerning the description of Paradise and the fact that it has already been created), in which he listed ahaadeeth, such as the one quoted above, which say that Allah shows the dead person his place in Paradise or Hell after he has been placed in his grave. 
All that remains for a person to do is to strive his utmost in worshipping his Lord and refraining from disobeying Him, in the hope that He may attain the victory of being admitted to Paradise and being saved from the painful torment. And Allah knows best.

14528,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/14528,He has repented from zina; does the hadd punishment have to be carried out on him?,"I am married and my wife is in my homeland but I work in a western country in order to earn a living and educate my children. But I committed the sin of zina, and I regretted it and repented to Allaah. Is that sufficient or not? Or must the hadd punishment also be carried out?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Undoubtedly zina is a major sin, and among the means that 
    lead to it are nakedness of women, mixing of men with non-mahram women, the 
    decline in morals and the corruptness of the environment in general. If you 
    committed zina because of being away from your wife and mixing with evil and 
    corrupt people, then you regretted your sin and repented to Allaah 
    sincerely, then we hope that Allaah will accept your repentance and forgive 
    your sin, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And those who invoke 
    not any other ilâh (god) along with Allaah, nor kill such person as Allaah 
    has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse  and whoever does this shall receive the punishment.

    69. The torment will be doubled to him on the Day of 
    Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace;

    70. Except those who repent and believe (in Islamic 
    Monotheism), and do righteous deeds; for those, Allaah will change their 
    sins into good deeds, and Allaah is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful”

    [al-Furqaan 25:68-70]

    And it was narrated from ‘Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit (may Allaah 
    be pleased with him), in the hadeeth about the women’s oath of allegiance, 
    that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “Whoever among you is faithful (to this pledge) his reward will be with 
    Allaah, and whoever does any of these things and is punished, his punishment 
    will be an expiation for him, and whoever does any of these things but 
    Allaah conceals him, then it is up to Allaah: if He wills He will punish him 
    and if He wills He will forgive him.” 
But you have to flee from 
    this corrupt environment that tempts you to sin and seek to earn a living in

I find it very difficult to be patient for my duaa to be supplicated, I have been praying for 7 years for marriage with a suitable muslim partner, but there are no prospects since we live in a place where there no muslims, how do i maintain patience for something for which i do not see any prospects,  thank you so much , i am really worried",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    and blessings and peace be upon the Messenger of Allaah.

     We advise you to fear Allaah and to bear patiently the thing 
    with which you are being tested, and to have certain faith that with a 
    problem comes a way out and with difficulty comes ease.

     It may be better for you to move to a country where there 
    are lots of Muslims, so as increase your chances of marriage to someone who 
    is righteous and pious.

     You should not be anxious about a matter that is decreed and 
    written, for you will not get anything other than that which Allaah has 
    decreed for you. How many women there are in the Muslim countries who pass 
    the age of thirty and forty without getting married, and there are some who 
    reached this age and then got married. 

     Du’aa’ is a powerful weapon for those who are able to use 
    it, so pray to Allaah and be certain that Allaah will respond, and seek the 
    means of having your du’aa’ accepted, such as eating and drinking only 
    things which are good (halaal), and choosing the good times to make du’aa’. 
    Beware of seeking a speedy response, for the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The du’aa’ of any one of you will be 
    answered so long as he does not seek to hasten it, and does not say, ‘I made 
    du’aa’ but I had no answer.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5865; Muslim, 2735, 
    from the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah).

     Know that a person’s du’aa’ is never wasted, and it benefits 
    him in all situations, as it says in the hadeeth which was narrated by 
    al-Tirmidhi from Abu Hurayrah, who said: “The Messenger of Allaah  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘There is no man who prays 
    to Allaah and makes du’aa’ to Him, and does not receive a response. Either 
    it will be hastened for him in this world, or it will be stored up for him 
    in the Hereafter, so long as he does not pray for something sinful, or to 
    cut the ties of kinship, or seek a speedy response.’ They said, ‘O Messenger 
    of Allaah, what does seeking a speedy response mean?’ He said, ‘Saying, “I 
    prayed to my Lord and He did not answer me.”’” (Al-Tirmidhi, 3859; classed 
    as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 852).

     Know that if you die chaste and you are a virgin, you will 
    have a great reward with Allaah, and whatever you missed out on in this 
    world, you will not miss out in the Hereafter, if you adhere steadfastly to 
    the truth. There is nothing wrong with expressing your wishes to some of 
    your Muslim sisters by mail or e-mail, so that they can help you to find a 
    righteous husband through them.


     We ask Allaah to grant you a way out soon and to bless you 
    with a righteous husband in whom you will find delight. And Allaah is the 
    Source of strength.

We have about 4 or 5 brothers who pretty much regularly pray Zhur and ‘Asr in this room. Is it permissible to make Friday prayers in this room? Considering that every alternate Friday is off for us and nobody makes a prayer in that room on such Fridays.,"If there is a mosque in which Jumu`ah prayers are held, then you must pray with them and it is not permissible for you to introduce another Jumu`ah prayer.",,"Praise be to Allah.If, in the city where you live, there is a mosque in which Jumu`ah prayers are held, then you must pray with them, and it is not permissible for you to introduce another Jumu`ah prayer . But if there is no Jumu`ah prayer in the city, then you must establish it and it is not permissible for you to pray Zuhr instead, because “Establishing Jumu`ah prayer in their towns and villages is obligatory upon the Muslims and offering the Jumu`ah prayer in congregation is a condition of it being valid. 
There is no shar’i evidence that stipulates a certain number being required for it to be valid. In order for it to be valid it is sufficient for there to be three or more. It is not permissible for one on whom Jumu`ah is obligatory to pray Zuhr instead on the grounds that the number is less than forty, according to the most correct scholarly opinion.” (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, no. 1794, 8/178)
 It says in the fatwa of the committee no. 957:
 “With regard to the number required to hold Jumu`ah prayers , we do not know of any text which stipulates a specific number. Because there is no text which stipulates a specific number, the scholars differed concerning the number required. Among the opinions which have been stated concerning that is the view that it may be done if there are three men who are local residents. This was reported from Imam Ahmad, and was the view favoured by al-Awza’i and Shaykh Taqiy al-Din Ibn Taymiyyah, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘come to the remembrance of Allah [Jumu`ah religious talk (Khutbah) and Salah (prayer)]’ [Al-Jumu`ah 62:9] – the verbal form used is plural, which implies a minimum of three.” (8/210)

Since birth she was born with a rear skin disease (fragile skin, breaking very easily and open wounds all over the body) that affected all her body parts (internal external) and wish caused her allot of pain and meant that she had to have so many operations. Then on top of her birth illness (skin disease) she suffered enlarge spleen, enlarged liver, skin cancer and the final illness that she got before passing away was a kidney failure meaning both kidneys stop working complelty. After her kidneys stopped she lived on the dialysis machine for four month going through so much pain and agony every time the machine was used which was every night. Her death was a sudden death and doctors said it was that her body had just given up.",,,"Praise be to Allah. 
          It is part of the belief of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah 
          that we cannot state definitively that any of the people of the Qiblah 
          (i.e., Muslims) will go to Paradise or to Hell, except for those concerning 
          whom Allaah or His Messenger have testified, because testifying to that 
          effect concerning any person is something that can only be known via 
          wahy (revelation), and revelation came to an end with the death of the 
          Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). So no one knows in what 
          state people will die, or what is hidden in their hearts except Allaah 
          Who created them. But the Muslim who believes in Tawheed will inevitably 
          enter Paradise if he bears witness to the Shahaadatayn and fulfils the 
          duties they require. Allaah may punish him if he commits some sins, 
          or He may forgive him, but his ultimate destiny will be Paradise. We 
          have to believe in Allaah’s promise which gives these glad tidings. 
 
          It was reported in the texts that if any Muslim child 
          dies before reaching the age of puberty, he will be under the care of 
          the Prophet of Allaah Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) and his wife Saarah, 
          and he will intercede for his parents on the Day of Resurrection. 
 
          But the one who lives beyond the age of puberty will 
          be requited for his deeds; if they were good then he will be rewarded, 
          otherwise he will be subject to the will of Allaah: if He wills He will 
          punish him and if He wills He will forgive him. 
 
          What the questioner mentioned, of the suffering endured 
          by her sister – may Allaah have mercy on her – perhaps Allaah will raise 
          her status with Him because of that. For no distress or grief befalls 
          a believer but Allaah expiates some of his sins thereby. It was reported 
          in the ahaadeeth that whoever dies because of a stomach disease (al-mabtoon) 
          is a shaheed (martyr), and on the Day of Resurrection, when those 
          who lived an easy life see the reward given to those who suffered during 
          their lives, they will wish that their skin had been cut with scissors. 
           
Hence we hope that if your sister died 
          bearing her affliction with patience, believing in Allaah, doing whatever 
          she could of the obligatory duties, that she will have a great reward 
          and a high status with Allaah. We ask Allaah to have mercy on us and 
          on her, for He is the All-Hearing, Ever-Responsive. And Allaah knows

    If the woman who has been divorced by khula’ is pregnant then 
    her ‘iddah lasts until she gives birth, according to scholarly consensus. 
    Al-Mughni, 11/227.

     But if she is not pregnant, the scholars differed concerning 
    her ‘iddah. Most of the scholars said that she should wait for three 
    menstrual cycles, because of the general meaning of the aayah 
    (interpretation of the meaning):

    “And divorced women shall wait (as 
    regards their marriage) for three menstrual periods”

    [al-Baqarah 2:228]

     But the correct view is that it is sufficient for a woman 
    divorced by khula’ to wait for one menstrual cycle, because the Prophet SAWS 
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told the wife of Thaabit ibn 
    Qays, when she divorced him by khula’, to wait out the ‘iddah for one 
    menstrual cycle. (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1185; classed as saheeh by 
    al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 946). This hadeeth refers 
    specifically to khula’ divorce whereas the aayah quoted above speaks of 
    divorce in general. But if she waits out an ‘iddah of three menstrual cycles 
    that will be more complete and will be on the safe side, and will avoid an 
    area of scholarly dispute, as some scholars say that she should wait for 
    three menstrual cycles, based on the aayah quoted.

    Masturbation is haraam, as is indicated by the Qur’aan and

    Masturbation does not necessarily mean using the hands.

    not, it is still haraam. The scholars have stated this clearly, including 
    Ibn ‘Aabideen in his commentary on al-Durr al-Mukhtaar. Some people

          The Qur’aan is the word of Allaah which was revealed 
          to Muhammad 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). It is mustahabb to read 
          it and recite it frequently. This is one of the means of raising one’s 
          status in Paradise, as it was narrated in the hadeeth of ‘Abd-Allaah 
          ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas (may Allaah be pleased with them both) that the 
          Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “It will be said to 
          the companions of the Qur’aan (i.e., those who read it much), ‘Read 
          and rise in status, recite as you used to recite in the world, for your 
          status will be commensurate with the last aayah you read.’” 
 
          Likewise, listening to the Qur’aan is also mustahabb, 
          as the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) listened to the recitation 
          of Abu Moosa al-Ash’ari, and he said to him, “If only you could have 
          seen me when I was listening to your recitation yesterday.” And the 
          Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) asked ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood 
          (may Allaah be pleased with him) to recite the Qur’aan to him. ‘Abd-Allaah 
          said, “Should I recite it to you when it was revealed to you?” The Messenger 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “I like to hear it 
          from others.” 
 
          So your listening to the Qur’aan on CD, as you asked 
          about, or from a tape recorder or on the radio or TV, comes under the 
          same ruling (i.e., it is mustahabb), whether that is at home, in the 
          car, on the bus  or in any other appropriate place. So long as 
          you focus on it and do not listen to it whilst doing something else, 
          you will be rewarded for listening. And Allaah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
