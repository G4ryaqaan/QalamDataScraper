Just before the meeqaat, when there is short distance remaining, he may enter ihraam for whatever he intends to do of Hajj or ‘Umrah. This is not difficult. If he does not know where the meeqaat is, he should ask the pilot or one of his assistants, or one of the air stewards, or a passenger whom he trusts and who has experience of that.

36610,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/36610,Omitted second tashahhud by mistake,"A woman prayed Jumu’ah in al-Masjid al-Haraam, and she thought that Jumu’ah was four rak’ahs, so when she was sitting for the final tashahhud she recited the first tashahhud, then was silent, waiting for the imam to stand up (for the third rak’ah), then the imam said the tasleem and she said the tasleem with him. Should she repeat her prayer?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The scholars differed concerning the ruling on sending 
    blessings upon the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    in the tashahhud. The Hanbalis are of the view that sending blessings upon 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is an essential 
    part of the prayer. The Shaafa’is are of the view that it is obligatory – 
    and this was also narrated in one report from Ahmad. The Hanafis and 
    Maalikis are of the view that it is Sunnah. 

    There is no sound, clear evidence to indicate that sending 
    blessings upon the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    in the tashahhud is an essential part of the prayer. The hadeeth of Abu 
    Mas’ood al-Ansaari, in which he says: “Allaah has commanded us to send 
    blessings upon you, O Messenger of Allaah; how should we send blessings upon 
    you?” (narrated by Muslim, 405) does not prove that it is obligatory to send 
    blessings upon the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    in the tashahhud, because they were asking him how; they were no asking him 
    how to do that in the prayer. 

    Hence evidence that it is Sunnah to send blessings upon the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in the tashahhud is 
    derived from the marfoo’ hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah: “When any one of you 
    finishes the last tashahhud, let him seek refuge in Allaah from four things: 
    from the torment of Hell, from the torment of the grave, from the trials of 
    life and death, and from the evil of the Dajjaal.” Narrated by Muslim, 588. 

    Based on the above, the most that can be said about what this woman omitted from her prayer is that it is obligatory, although the view that it is Sunnah is a strong view. But because she caught up with the whole prayer with the imam, the imam bears responsibility for her shortcoming. And Allaah knows best.",Islam Q&A
36616,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/36616,Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab – a reformer concerning whom many malicious lies have been told,"Why is so much of what is said about Shaykh al-Islam Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab so hostile, and why are his followers called Wahhabis?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.You should note that one of the ways in which Allah deals with His chosen slaves is to test them according to the level of their faith, to show who is sincere and who is not. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Alif-Laam-Meem.
[These letters are one of the miracles of the Quran, and none but Allah (Alone) knows their meanings.]
2. Do people think that they will be left alone because they say: ‘We believe,’ and will not be tested.
3. And We indeed tested those who were before them. And Allah will certainly make (it) known (the truth of) those who are true, and will certainly make (it) known (the falsehood of) those who are liars, (although Allah knows all that before putting them to test)” [Al-‘Ankaboot 29:1-3]
Those who are most severely tested are the Prophets, then the next best and the next best, as it says in the saheeh hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
If you study the seerah (biography) of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), you will see that he went through severe tests; he was even accused of being a liar, a sorcerer and a madman; garbage and filth were thrown on his back; he was expelled from Makkah; and his feet bled in al-Taa’if. This was the situation of all the Prophets who were rejected before him (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
Shaykh al-Islam Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab (may Allah have mercy on him) suffered the same as other sincere scholars and daa’iyahs, but in the end the message of truth that he brought prevailed. How could it be otherwise? How could the light of truth be extinguished? Think about this man and how Allah helped him to sow the seeds of Tawheed throughout the Arabian Peninsula and put an end to all kinds of shirk. If this indicates anything, it indicates that he was sincere in his call and made sacrifices for that cause as far as we can tell, and of course his efforts were supported and helped by Allah. 
But the enemies of this call have spared no effort to make false accusations concerning it. They claimed – falsely – that the Shaykh claimed to be a prophet, and that he did not respect the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) properly, and that he condemned all the ummah as kaafirs… and other fabrications and lies that were told about him. Anyone who examines these claims will realize for sure that they are all lies and fabrications. The books of the Shaykh which are widely circulated bear the greatest witness to that, and his followers who answered his call never mentioned anything to that effect. If the matter were as they claim, his followers would have conveyed the same ideas, otherwise they would have been disloyal to him. If you want to know more details about this and to clarify the matter, you should read the book Da’aawa al-Manaawi’een li Da’wah al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab by Dr ‘Abd al-‘Azeez al-‘Abd al-Lateef, which will answer all your questions, if Allah wills. 
With regard to calling his followers Wahhaabis, this is just another in a long series of fabrications made up by the enemies of his call, to divert people away from the call of truth and to place a barrier between his call and the people so that the call will not reach them. If you study the story of how al-Tufayl ibn ‘Amr al-Dawsi (may Allah be pleased with him) became Muslim, you will see the parallels with what happened in the case of Imam Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab. 
Ibn Hishaam narrated in his Seerah (1/394) that al-Tufayl set out towards Makkah, but Quraysh intercepted him at the gates of the city and warned him against listening to Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). They made him think that he was a sorcerer who could cause division between man and wife… they kept on at him until he took some cotton and put it in his ears. Then when he saw the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), he thought to himself that he would take out the cotton and listen to him, and if what he said was true then he would accept it from him, and if he what he said was false and abhorrent, he would reject it. When he listened to him, all he could do was become Muslim on the spot. 
Yes, he became Muslim after putting cotton in his ears. Those who oppose the call of Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab fabricated lies the same way Quraysh did. Quraysh understood full well that the call of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had the power to reach people’s hearts and minds, so they exaggerated in their lies about the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in an attempt to stop the truth reaching people. Similarly we see that those who speak against Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab and his followers repeat the same lies that were told against the original call. 
You should – if you follow the truth – not pay any attention to these lies and fabrications. You should look for the truth of the matter by reading the books of Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Wahhaab, for his books are the greatest proof that these people are lying, praise be to Allah. 
There is another subtle point that should be noted, which is that the Shaykh’s name was Muhammad, the attributive of which is Muhammadi. The word Wahhabi is the attributive derived from al-Wahhaab (the Bestower), who is Allah, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Our Lord! Let not our hearts deviate (from the truth) after You have guided us, and grant us mercy from You. Truly, You are the Bestower [al-Wahhaab]” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:8]
As al-Zajjaaj said in Ishtiqaaq Asma’-Allah, p. 126, al-Wahhaab “is the One Who gives a great deal. This form (fa’’aal) in Arabic is indicative of something that is done to a great extent. Allah is al-Wahhaab (the Bestower) Who gives to His slaves one after another.” 
Undoubtedly the path of al-Wahhaab is the path of truth in which there is no crookedness or fabrication, and His party is the one that will prevail. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And whosoever takes Allah, His Messenger, and those who have believed, as Protectors, then the party of Allah will be the victorious” [Al-Maa’idah 5:56] 
“They are the party of Allah. Verily, it is the party of Allah that will be the successful” [Al-Mujaadilah 58:22]
Long ago they accused al-Shaafa’i of being a Raafidi (Shi’ah) and he refuted them by saying:
“If being a Raafidi means loving the family of Muhammad, then let the two races (of mankind and the jinn) bear witness that I am a Raafidi.” 
We refute the claims of those who accuse us of being Wahhabis by quoting the words of Shaykh Mullah ‘Imraan who was a Shi’i but Allah guided him to the Sunnah. He said: 
“If the follower of Ahmad [the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)] is a Wahhaabi, then I affirm that I am a Wahhaabi 
I reject the association of any other with Allah, for I have no Lord except the Unique, the Bestower (al-Wahhaab) 
Those who were called by the Prophet accused him of being a sorcerer and a liar.” 
(See: Manhaaj al-Firqat al-Naajiyah by Shaykh Muhammad Jameel Zayno, p. 142-143.

36617,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/36617,Meaning of the verse “Whoever hastens to leave in two days”,"My question is about hastening to leave during Hajj. Why does the one who hastens leave depart on the twelfth (of Dhu’l-Hijjah) and the one who stays departs on the thirteenth, when Allah says “Whoever hastens to leave in two days” [al-Baqarah 2:203]? Wouldn’t that mean that the one who hastens would leave on the eleventh?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The meaning of the verse is one who hastens to leave within two days of the days of al-Tashreeq, which are the eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth. So hastening to leave means leaving on the twelfth. Perhaps the questioner assumed that that first day was the day of Eid, but this is incorrect. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
I would like to alert our brother pilgrims to this mistake, because many pilgrims assume that what is meant by the verse “Whoever hastens to leave in two days” [al-Baqarah 2:203 – interpretation of the meaning] is leaving on the eleventh, so they count the two days as the day of Eid and the eleventh of Dhu’l-Hijjah. But this is not the case, rather this is a misunderstanding, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And remember Allah during the appointed Days. But whosoever hastens to leave in two days, there is no sin on him” [al-Baqarah 2:203]
 The appointed days are the days of al-Tashreeq, and the first of the days of al-Tashreeq is the eleventh. Based on this, the phrase “whoever hastens to leave in two days” means in two days of the days of al-Tashreeq, which is the twelfth. So people should make sure that they understand this matter correctly, so that they will not make mistakes.

36618,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/36618,He got to know a girl through the internet and he wants to marry her but her father is refusing,"I am a Muslim Arab youth. I got to know a Muslim girl of Arab origin who lives overseas, through the internet. It was – and still is – a relationship within the limits of the laws of Allaah, because, praise be to Allaah, I fear Allaah a great deal. I love her and she loves me because she is a committed Muslim girl, and she also fears Allaah. Our love is for the sake of Allaah, in sha Allaah. 
I proposed marriage to her, and she accepted and agreed, and I praised Allaah for answering my du’aa’ by blessing me with a righteous wife, especially since I have wanted to get married and settle down for a number of years. She told her mother, who is a non-Arab, and she agreed at first, because her father had been away from them from a while. Her father recently returned, and she was happy, but he had come to tell his daughter to get ready to marry a man from her father’s country, without asking his daughter’s opinion of the prospective groom. She is afraid of him because he beats her sometimes, and she sometimes says that he is crazy; may Allaah guide us and him. 
She told me that she does not want to marry this man and that she wants to marry me, and I told her the same thing. She said to me: What do you think of marrying me in secret, then we tell her father what has happened. She is over 18 years of age.",,,"Praise be to Allah.You should note that Allaah sees and knows all that you do. 
“Allaah knows the fraud of the eyes, and all that the breasts conceal”
[Ghaafir 40:19 – interpretation of the meaning]
You should also note that you have done something that is not permissible according to sharee’ah, which is corresponding and speaking to one another. You have seen how the relationship between you developed until the Shaytaan was able to deceive you and make your relationship appear to you to be “love for the sake of Allaah”. 
Secondly: 
We know that love is the matter of the heart, and that a person is not to be blamed for that over which he has no control. But he is to be blamed fully for the things that led him to enter into this relationship, such as forbidden glances, or words spoken in secret over the phone or via the internet, and other footsteps of the Shaytaan which he wants to people to follow and fall into evil ways. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Follow not the footsteps of Shaytaan (Satan). And whosoever follows the footsteps of Shaytaan (Satan), then, verily, he commands Al-Fahsha’ [i.e. to commit indecency (illegal sexual intercourse)], and Al-Munkar [disbelief and polytheism (i.e. to do evil and wicked deeds; and to speak or to do what is forbidden in Islam)]. And had it not been for the Grace of Allaah and His Mercy on you, not one of you would ever have been pure from sins. But Allaah purifies (guides to Islam) whom He wills, and Allaah is All-Hearer, All-Knower”
[al-Noor 24:21]
He is also to be blamed for getting carried away in a matter in which the beginning is haraam and the end of which is an invalid marriage. 
But it has gone this far, and the relationship between you has reached the stage that you describe, so now it is up to the girl and her family. If the woman can convince her father not to marry her off to someone whom she dislikes, and she and her mother can convince him to let her marry you, and she is – as you say – qualified for marriage, then you should follow the steps outlined in sharee’ah of asking her father or her guardian for her hand in marriage. If you see that the path to marriage is blocked, then it is not permissible for you to carry on with this relationship. Whoever gives up something for the sake of Allaah, Allaah will compensate him with something better than it. It may be better for her to marry someone other than you, and it may be better for you to marry someone other than her. 
“and it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you and that you like a thing which is bad for you. Allaah knows but you do not know”
[al-Baqarah 2:216 – interpretation of the meaning]
If what this girl says about her father is true and he is insane – but we do not think that he really is insane in the sense that his rights of shar’i guardianship over her are waived and he is not fit to take charge of the affairs of his dependents – or he is denying her the right to marry one who is compatible with no legitimate shar’i excuse, then in that case the role of guardian is transferred to the next closest guardian, so it moves from the father to the grandfather, for example. This matter is discussed in detail in the answer to question no. 7193. 
As for thinking of getting married in secret, without her guardian’s permission, this will only make matters even worse. May Allaah protect us and you from the causes of His wrath and punishment. 
Do you not know that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Any woman who gets married without the permission of her guardian, her marriage is invalid,” three times. Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2083; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. So how can you think of this invalid marriage that is not pleasing to Allaah and His Messenger, and then claim that your love is for the sake of Allaah? 
Do you not know that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded that marriages be announced publicly? He said: “Announce marriages publicly.” Narrated by Ahmad from the hadeeth of ‘Abd-Allaah ibn al-Zubayr. Al-Albaani said: (it is) hasan. 
He made this public announcement the factor that distinguishes a halaal marriage from haraam fornication, and said: “What distinguishes between haraam and halaal is the daff and voices (raised in song).” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1088; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
Imam al-Baaji (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in Sharh al-Muwatta’: There is no dissent concerning the fact that marriage in secret is forbidden, because it is similar to zina which is also done in secret… hence it is prescribed to celebrate marriages and give wedding feasts, because that is a public announcement of the marriage. 
He also said:  Every marriage in which the witnesses are sworn to secrecy is a secret marriage, even if there are many witnesses. 
Look at what you two are claiming. Is it a permissible marriage as prescribed by Allaah and His Messenger, or it is the matter of whims and desires and zina, and the footsteps of the Shaytaan? 
Beware before you both slip and fall, and build your lives on a shaky foundation. May Allaah keep us and you safe from the Fire of Hell. 
But if the father of this girl wants to arrange her marriage against her wishes, neither the father nor any other guardian, has the right to force his daughter to marry someone she dislikes, as is explained in questions no. 26852, 7193, 22760.  But this is nothing to do with you, and you are not responsible for that. So leave her and her guardians alone. If is not decreed for you two to marry, and you withdraw from her life, as is required of you in that case, then perhaps she will see that this suitor or someone else is the right husband for her. May Allaah make us and you rich (independent of means) by His bounty. And Allaah is the Source of strength.",Islam Q&A
36619,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/36619,Hajj Rules for Women,"I have decided to do Hajj this year, in sha Allah. I hope that you can give me some advice which will be of benefit to me during Hajj.
I would also like to ask this question: are there rulings that apply specifically to women during Hajj distinct from men?",Here are some Hajj rules for women: 1- It is not permissible to travel for Hajj without a mahram; 2- A woman may enter ihram in whatever clothes she likes; 3- it is haram for women in ihram to put on any kind of perfume.,"Hajj: The jihad of Muslim women


Hajj rules for women","Praise be to Allah.Hajj: The jihad of Muslim women
Congratulations on your decision to go to Makkah to perform the obligatory duty of Hajj, this obligation which many Muslim women do not pay enough attention to. 
Some women are ignorant of the fact that Hajj is obligatory for them; some know that but they procrastinate until death takes them unaware and they have failed to go for Hajj. Some of them do not understand any of the rituals so they do things that are haram and may even invalidate their Hajj without realizing. Allah is the One Whose help we seek. 
Hajj is a duty that Allah has enjoined upon His slaves, it is the fifth pillar of Islam and it is the jihad of women, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her): “Your jihad is Hajj.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari)
Hajj rules for women 
There follows some advice and the rulings that apply specifically to women who want to do Hajj. These are things that will help to make your Hajj acceptable, and an accepted Hajj, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “brings no less a reward than Paradise.” (Agreed upon)

Sincerity towards Allah is a condition of any act of worship, including Hajj, being valid and acceptable. So be sincere towards Allah in your Hajj and beware of showing off, for showing off invalidates good deeds and brings punishment. 
Following the Sunnah and doing actions in accordance with the teachings of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the second condition of actions being valid and acceptable, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Whoever does any action that is not in accordance with this matter of ours, will have it rejected.” Narrated by Muslim.                                                    This means that you should learn the rulings of Hajj according to the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), with the help of useful books which are based on sahih evidence from the Quran and Sunnah. 
Beware of major and minor shirk (association of others with Allah), and of sin in all its forms. Major shirk means that a person goes beyond the pale of Islam, his good deeds are rendered invalid and he is exposed to punishment. Minor shirk means that a person’s good deeds are rendered invalid and he is exposed to punishment. Sin means that he is exposed to punishment. 
It is not permissible for a woman to travel for Hajj or for any other purpose without a mahram, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No woman should travel without a mahram.” Agreed upon.                                                                                                                                                                                    The mahram is the husband or any man whom a woman is forever forbidden to marry because of blood ties or rada'ah (ties that result from breastfeeding) or ties through marriage. This is one of the conditions of Hajj being obligatory for women. If a woman does not have a mahram to travel with her, then she does not have to do Hajj. 
A woman may enter ihram in whatever clothes she likes, black or any other colour, so long as she avoids wanton display (tabarruj) or clothes of fame and vanity such as tight, see-through, short, thin or decorated clothes. Women must also be careful to avoid clothes that resemble the clothes of men or the kuffar.          Hence we know that there is no evidence for the practice of some of the common folk of choosing a specific colour for women to wear in ihram, such as green or white; rather this is a kind of bid’ah (innovation).
After forming the intention for ihram, it is haram for the muhrimah (woman in ihram) to put on any kind of perfume , whether on the body or clothes. 
It is haram for the muhrimah to remove any hair from her head or body by any means, and to clip the nails. 
It is haram for the muhrimah to wear the burqa’ or niqab (kinds of face-veils), and to wear gloves, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Women (during Hajj) should not wear niqab or gloves.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari. 
The muhrimah should not uncover her face or hands in front of non-mahram men using the excuse that the niqab and gloves are among the things that are forbidden in ihram, because they can cover their faces and hands with anything such as their clothes, scarves, etc. Umm al-Muminin ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “The riders used to pass by us when we were with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in ihram. When they came alongside us we would lower our jilbabs from our heads over our faces, and when they had passed by we would uncover them.”  Narrated by Abu Dawud and classed as sahih by al-Albani in Hijab al-Mar-ah al-Muslimah. 
Some women, when they enter ihram, put something like a turban or clips on their heads, so that no part of the khimar or jilbab will cover their faces. This is going to trouble for which there is no need, because there is nothing wrong with the cover touching the face of the muhrimah. 
It is permissible for the muhrimah to wear a shirt, pants, socks on the feet, gold bangles and rings, watches, etc, but she should cover her adornments in front of non-mahram men during Hajj and at other times. 
Some women, if they pass the miqat with the intention of doing Hajj or ‘Umrah and happen to be menstruating, do not enter ihram, thinking that it is a condition of ihram to be free of menstruation. So they pass the miqat without entering ihram. This is an obvious mistake, because menstruation does not mean that a woman cannot enter ihram. So a menstruating woman should enter ihram and do everything that other pilgrims do, apart from tawaf around the Ka’bah. She should delay tawaf until she becomes pure (i.e., until her period ends). If she delays ihram and passes the miqat without entering ihram, then she has to go back and enter ihram from the miqat; if she does not go back then she has to offer a sacrifice because she failed to do something that was obligatory upon her. 
If a woman fears that she may not be able to complete the rituals of Hajj, she may stipulate a condition when entering ihram by saying, “If I am prevented (from completing Hajj), then I will exit ihram at the point at which I am prevented.” Then if something happens to prevent her from completing Hajj, she will exit ihram and there will be no blame on her. 
Remember the actions of Hajj: 
When the day of al-Tarwiyah comes, which is the eighth day of Dhu’l-Hijjah, do ghusl and enter ihram, and recite the Talbiyah, saying, “Labbayka Allahumma labbayk , labbayka la sharika laka labbayk. Inna al-hamd wa’l-ni’mata laka wa’l-mulk, la sharika lak  (Here I am, O Allah, here I am. Here I am, You have no partner, here I am. Verily all praise and blessings are Yours, and all sovereignty, You have no partner).”
Go out to Mina , and pray there Zuhr, ‘Asr, Maghrib, ‘Isha and Fajr, shortening the four-rak’ah prayers to two rak’ahs without joining them.
When the sun rises on the ninth day of Dhu’l-Hijjah, go to ‘Arafah , and pray Zuhr and ‘Asr there, shortened and joined at the time of Zuhr. Stay in ‘Arafah making du’a, remembering Allah, beseeching Allah and repenting, until sunset.
When the sun sets on the ninth day, go from ‘Arafah to Muzdalifah, and pray there Maghrib and ‘Isha’, shortened and joined. Stay there until Fajr prayer, and strive hard after Fajr in dhikr, du’a and conversing with Allah, until it has become very light.
Set out from Muzdalifah to Mina before the sun rises on the day of ‘Eid. When you reach Mina, do the following:


Stone Jamrat al-‘Aqabah with seven pebbles, and say Takbir (“Allahu akbar”) with each throw.
Slaughter the hadiy (sacrifice) after the sun has risen.
Cut a fingertip’s length from each side of your hair (approximately two centimeters).
Go back to Makkah and do tawaf al-ifadah , and do the sa’i of Hajj between al-Safa and al-Marwah, if you are doing tamattu’, or if you are doing ifrad or qiran but you did not do sa’i after the tawaf of arrival.


Stone the Jamarat on the 11th, 12th and 13th of Dhu’l-Hijjah, after the sun has passed its zenith, if you want to delay departure; or on the 11th and 12th only if you want to leave sooner. You must also stay in Mina on those nights.
If you want to go back to your country, then do the farewell tawaf; this will conclude the actions of Hajj.


Women should not recite the Talbiyah out loud, rather they should say it quietly so that only they and the women next to them can hear it and so that non-mahram men cannot hear it, lest that cause fitnah (temptation) and attract attention. The time for reciting the Talbiyah starts from after entering ihram for Hajj and lasts until one stones the Jamrat al-‘Aqabah on the Day of Sacrifice. 
If a woman’s period begins after she has done tawaf and before she does sa’i, she should complete the rest of the rituals and do sa’i even if she is menstruating, because taharah (purity) is not essential for sa’i. 
It is permissible for a woman to use pills to delay menstruation to enable her to perform the rituals of Hajj, subject to the condition that this will not cause her harm. 
Beware of crowding with men in all the rituals of Hajj, especially during tawaf and at the Black Stone and the Yemeni Corner, during sa’i and when stoning the Jamarat. Choose times when there is less crowding. Umm al-Muminin ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) used to do tawaf in an area away from the men, and she did not touch the Black Stone or the Yemeni Corner if there was crowding. 
Women do not have to walk quickly (raml) during tawaf or jog (rakd) during sa’i. Raml means walking quickly in the first three circuits of tawaf, and rakd means jogging between the two green markers in every circuit of sa’i. These actions are Sunnah for men only. 
Beware of this small book which contains innovated du’as, such as a specific du’a for each circuit of tawaf and sa’i for which there is no evidence from the Quran and Sunnah. It is prescribed to recite dua' during tawaf and sa’i however one wishes, for the best in this world and in the Hereafter. If the du’a is one that is narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), that is even better. 
A woman who is menstruating can read books of du'a' and dhikr that are prescribed in shari’ah, even if they contain verses of Quran. It is also permissible for her to recite Quran without touching the Mus-haf. 
Beware of uncovering any part of your body, especially in places where men could see you, such as public wudu areas. Some women do not care about men being close to such areas and they uncover during wudu things that it is not permissible to uncover, such as the face, forearms and calves. They may even take off their headcovers, thus uncovering their heads and necks. All of that is haram and is not permissible, because it causes a great deal of fitnah (temptation) to them and to men. 
It is permissible for women to leave Muzdalifah before dawn , because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) allowed some women, especially those who were weak, to leave Muzdalifah after the moon had set at the end of the night. That was so that they could stone Jamarat al-‘Aqabah before it became crowded. In al-Sahihayn it is narrated from ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that Sawdah (may Allah be pleased with her) asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) on the night of Muzdalifah for permission to leave before it became too crowded, because she was a heavy woman, and he gave her permission.
It is permissible to delay stoning the Jamrah until the night, if the woman’s guardian thinks that the crowding is too great around Jamrat al-‘Aqabah and that this may pose a danger to the women who are with him. So it is permissible to delay their stoning of the Jamrah until the crowding is less or has stopped, and there is nothing wrong with them doing that. 

The same applies with regard to stoning of the Jamarat during the three days of Tashriq, when women can stone them after ‘Asr, which is the time when the crowding is a lot less, as is well known. If that is not possible then there is nothing wrong with them delaying it until the night. 

Beware of the following point: it is not permissible for a woman to allow her husband to have intercourse with her or to be intimate with her so long as she has not yet exited ihram completely. This exiting ihram is achieved when three things take place: 


Stoning Jamarat al-‘Aqabah with seven pebbles.
Cutting the length of a fingertip from all ends of the hair, which is approximately 2 centimeters.
Doing the tawaf of Hajj (tawaf al-ifadah).

Once a woman has done these three things it is permissible to do all the things that were forbidden to her during ihram, including intercourse. If she has only done two of them then it is permissible for her to do anything apart from intercourse.

It is not permissible for a woman to show her hair to non-mahram men whilst she is cutting the ends of her hair, as many women do at the Mas’a (place of sa’i), because the hair is ‘awrah and it is not permissible to show it to any non-mahram men. 
Beware of sleeping in front of men. This is what we see many women doing who do Hajj with their families without a tent or anything to conceal them from the eyes of men, so they sleep in the streets or on the sidewalks, and under elevated bridges, and in Masjid al-Khif, amongst men or close to men. This is one of the greatest evils which a stop must be put to. 
Women who are menstruating or bleeding following childbirth do not have to do the farewell tawaf. This is one of the allowances that shari’ah makes to women. Women who are menstruating can go back to their families even if they have not done the farewell tawaf, so give thanks to Allah for this allowance and blessing.

Formulas of Takbir in the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah


 The time of Takbir in Dhul-Hijjah","Praise be to Allah.
Firstly:
The virtues of Takbir in the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah
The first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah are venerated days. Allah swore by them in His Book, and swearing by a thing is indicative of its importance and great benefit. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“By the dawn; By the ten nights (i.e. the first ten days of the month of Dhul-Hijjah)” [Al-Fajr 89:1]
Ibn ‘Abbas, Ibn al-Zubayr, Mujahid and others among the earlier and later generations said: This refers to the ten days of Dhu’l-Hijjah. Ibn Kathir said: This is the correct view. (Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 8/413)
 Good deeds during these days are beloved to Allah, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There are no days in which righteous deeds are more beloved to Allah than these ten days.” They said, “O Messenger of Allah, not even jihad for the sake of Allah?” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Not even jihad for the sake of Allah, except in the case of a man who went out to fight, giving himself and his wealth up for the cause, and came back with nothing.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 969; al-Tirmidhi, 757. This version was narrated by al-Tirmidhi and classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi, 605. 
One of the righteous deeds during these days is to remember Allah by reciting takbir (saying “Allahu akbar”) and tahlil (saying “La ilaha ill-Allah”), because of the following evidence. 

Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“That they may witness things that are of benefit to them (i.e. reward of Hajj in the Hereafter, and also some worldly gain from trade), and mention the Name of Allah on appointed days” [Al-Hajj 22:28]
The “appointed days” are the first ten days of Dhu’l-Hijjah. 

Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“And remember Allah during the appointed Days” [Al-Baqarah 2:203]
These are the days of al-Tashriq, i.e. the 11th, 12th and 13th of Dhul-Hijjah. 

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The days of tashriq are the days of eating, drinking and remembering Allah.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1141)

Secondly: 
Formulas of Takbir in the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah
The scholars have different views on the formulas of Takbir. 
1- The first view is that it is: 
Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar, la ilaha ill-Allah, Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar, wa lillahi’l-hamd (Allah is Most Great, Allah is Most Great, there is no god but Allah, Allah is Most Great, Allah is Most Great, and to Allah be praise). 
2- The second view is that it is: 
Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar, la ilaha ill-Allah, Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar, wa lillahi’l-hamd (Allah is Most Great, Allah is Most Great, Allah is Most Great, there is no god but Allah, Allah is Most Great, Allah is Most Great, Allah is Most Great, and to Allah be praise). 
3- The third view is that it is: 
Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar, la ilaha ill-Allah, Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar, wa lillahi’l-hamd (Allah is Most Great, Allah is Most Great, Allah is Most Great, there is no god but Allah, Allah is Most Great, Allah is Most Great, and to Allah be praise). 
The matter is broad in scope because there is no text narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)which specifies a particular form of Takbir. 
Thirdly:
 The time of Takbir in Dhul-Hijjah
The takbir is divided into two categories: 
1 – Unrestricted Takbir. This is the takbir that is not limited to a specific time, and it is Sunnah to say it all the time, morning and evening, before prayer and after prayer, at all times. 
2 – Restricted Takbir. This is the takbir that is limited to the time immediately after prayer.
 It is Sunnah to recite unrestricted takbir at any time during the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah and all the days of Tashriq, starting from the beginning of the month of Dhul-Hijjah (i.e., from sunset on the last day of Dhul-Qi’dah) until the end of the days of Al-Tashriq, which is when the sun sets on the thirteenth day of Dhul-Hijjah).
With regard to restricted takbir, it starts from Fajr on the day of ‘Arafah and lasts until the sun sets on the last day of the days of Tashriq, in addition to the takbir that may be recited at any time. So when a person says the taslim at the end of the obligatory prayer, he should pray for forgiveness (by saying Astaghfir-Allah) three times, and say, “Allahumma anta al-salam wa minka al-salam, tabarakta ya dha’l-jalali wa’l-ikram (“O Allah, You are al-Salam [the One Who is free from all defects and deficiencies), and from You is all peace, blessed are You, O possessor of majesty and honour”), then start the takbir.
 This is for those who are not on Hajj. The pilgrims should start the takbir after prayer from Zhuhr on the Day of Sacrifice (the 10th of Dhul-Hijjah).
 And Allah knows best.

Majmu’ Fatawa Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him), 13/17;

36628,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/36628,Du’aa’ in unison during tawaaf,"We noticed that some people who do tawaaf walk behind a man called a mutawwif (Hajj guide), who makes du’aa’ and they rest say “Ameen” to his du’aa’. What is your opinion on that?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah 
    have mercy on him) said: 
One of the mistakes made by some people when 
    doing tawaaf is that a group will gather around a leader who leads them in tawaaf and who recites du’aa’ in a loud voice, and they repeat what he 
    says, loudly and in unison. This causes confusion and disturbs others who are doing tawaaf, and makes them not know what they are saying. This 
    causes them to have no proper focus (khushoo’) and it disturbs the slaves of Allaah in that peaceful place. 
I wonder why this leader does not, when he 
    brings them to the Ka’bah, turn to face them and tell them, “Do this, and say this, and make du’aa’ as you wish,” then start walking with them in 
    tawaaf, so that no one will make any mistakes; then that they could do tawaaf in a focused and dignified manner, calling upon their Lord with fear 
    and longing, calling upon Him and beseeching Him as they like, with words that they understand and really mean, and sparing other people from 
    their disturbance. 
The same applies to raising the voice in 
    du’aa’. Some people raise their voices in du’aa’ whilst doing tawaaf, in a manner that annoys others and causes them to lose the proper focus 
    (khushoo’), and in a manner that is unbefitting in this sacred place and that disturbs others who are doing tawaaf. Disturbing people when they 
    are worshipping is a reprehensible action. It was narrated that Abu Sa’eed said: The Messenger of Allaah was in i’tikaaf (retreat for the purpose 
    of devoting oneself to worship) in the mosque, and he heard them reading Qur’aan out loud. He drew back the curtain and said, “Each one of you is 
    conversing with his Lord, so do not disturb one another or raise your voices over one another when reading” – or he said, “when praying.” Narrated 
    by Abu Dawood, 1332; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 1183. 
But some people – we ask Allah to guide them – raise their voices when making du’aa’ in the 
    Mutaaf (area for tawaaf). As well as the haraam things that we have mentioned, it also involves causing people to lose their proper focus in 
    worship, implies disrespect for the place, and annoys people who are doing tawaaf. So it goes against the apparent meaning of the verse:
“Invoke your Lord 
    with humility and in secret. He likes not the aggressors”
[al-A’raaf 7:55 – interpretation of the 
    meaning].",Islam Q&A
36636,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/36636,Should he do more tawaaf or more prayers in al-Masjid al-Haraam?,Is it better for the one who is in Makkah to do more prayers in al-Masjid al-Haraam or more tawaaf?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Praying in al-Masjid al-Haraam and tawaaf around the Ka’bah are both acts that bring great virtue. Ahmad (14284) and Ibn Maajah (1406) narrated that Jaabir said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘One prayer offered in al-Masjid al-Haraam is better than one hundred thousand prayers offered elsewhere.’” Al-Haafiz said: the men of its isnaad are thiqaat (trustworthy). It was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel, 1129. 
Al-Tirmidhi (959) narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar said: “I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say, ‘Whoever circumambulates this House seven times, fulfilling all the conditions of tawaaf, it is as if he freed a slave. He does not put down one foot and lift the other but Allaah will erase one bad deed and will record one good deed for him.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: Is it better for the one who is staying in Makkah to circumambulate the House or to pray? 
He replied: 
As to whether prayer is better than tawaaf or tawaaf is better than prayer, this is a matter which is subject to further discussion. A number of scholars stated that it is better for the stranger to do a lot of tawaaf, because prayer may be done anywhere, not only in al-Masjid al-Haraam, but tawaaf can only be done in Makkah, and he does not live in Makkah, rather he will leave and go away from it. So it is more appropriate for him to make the most of the opportunity to do tawaaf.
 But for those who are resident in Makkah, prayer is more important because prayer is better than tawaaf, so if they do more prayers, that is better.

Honouring one's parents and helping them to do things that are obligatory is something that is prescribed in sharee’ah to the extent that one is able to do it. But you should do Hajj yourself first, then help your parents, if it is not easy to do both. If you give precedence to your parents over yourself, their Hajj will still be valid.

But if he is able to practise his religion openly, then he does not have to migrate. See question no. 13363. 
If he thinks that staying in his country is more beneficial because he will be able to call others to Islam and guide people, and he is confident of his religious commitment, then his staying there is better than his migrating. See question no. 47672. 
Hijrah (migration) does not necessarily have to be to Madeenah, rather you can migrate to any Muslim land where you can establish the symbols of Islam and safely practise Islam.

What is the ruling on that?","It is not narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) touched anything of the Ka`bah apart from the Yemeni Corner and the Black Stone. If a person touches any corner or side of the Ka`bah apart from the Yemeni Corner and the Black Stone, then he is considered to be an innovator (follower of bid`ah).","Did the Prophet touch the Ka`bah?


Did the Prophet touch Maqam Ibrahim?


Did the Prophet touch Zamzam?","Praise be to Allah.This question was put to Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him), who replied as follows: 
Did the Prophet touch the Ka`bah?
“Touching the Ka`bah is an action which some people do, seeking thereby to draw closer to Allah and to worship Him. Every action which is done with the intention of drawing closer to Allah and worshipping Him, but which has no basis in the Shari`ah, is an innovation. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) warned against that when he said: “Beware of newly-innovated matters, for every innovation is a going astray.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2676; Abu Dawud, 4607)
It is not narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) touched anything apart from the Yemeni Corner and the Black Stone. 
On this basis, if a person touches any corner or side of the Ka`bah apart from the Yemeni Corner and the Black Stone , then he is considered to be an innovator (follower of bid’ah).
When ‘Abd-Allah ibn `Abbas saw Mu’awiyah ibn Abi Sufyan (may Allah be pleased with him) touching the two northern corners of the Ka`bah, he told him not to do that. Mu’awiyah (may Allah be pleased with him) said to him: “No part of the House should be ignored.’ Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “ ‘Indeed in the Messenger of Allah (Muhammad) you have a good example to follow” [al-Ahzab 33:21 – interpretation of the meaning]. And I saw the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) touching the two Yemeni corners,” meaning the Yemeni Corner and the Black Stone. So Mu’awiyah accepted what Ibn `Abbas said. 
Did the Prophet touch Maqam Ibrahim?
A more serious form of bid`ah is what some people do, namely touching Maqam Ibrahim . It was not narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) touched any part of the Maqam .
Did the Prophet touch Zamzam?
The same applies to other actions that some people do, namely touching Zamzam or touching the pillars of the porticos – the ancient pillars built by the Ottomans. None of these actions were narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), so they are all bid`ah (innovations), and every innovation is a going astray.”

Slaughtering the sacrifice is better than giving its price in charity, because that was what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the Muslims with him did. And because the sacrifice is one of the ritual of Islam; if the people turn away from it and give charity instead, that symbol will die out. If giving the price of the sacrifice in charity was better than slaughtering the sacrifice, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would have explained that to his ummah in word and deed, because he did not omit to explain anything that was good for the ummah. Indeed, if giving charity was equal to offering the sacrifice he would have explained that too, because it is easier than going to the trouble of offering the sacrifice. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) never failed to point out the easier option to his ummah when it was equal to the more difficult option. There was a famine during the lifetime of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and he said, “Whoever among you offers a sacrifice should not keep any of it in his house for more than three days.”
 The following year, they said, “O Messenger of Allah, should we do what we did last year?” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Eat and feed the poor and store some, for last year the people were having a hard time and I wanted you to help them.” Agreed upon.
 Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Sacrifice when prescribed is better than giving its price in charity. He said, Hence even if you give many times more the value of the sacrifice for tamattu’ and qiraan, it will never take its place, and the same applies to udhiyah.",Risaalat Ahkaam al-Udhiyah wa’l-Dhakaah

Many people do this. Is this action valid?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.This action is not correct. What they should 
    do is to enter ihraam from the meeqaat. If they pass it without entering ihraam, then they have to go back to it and enter ihraam from there. If 
    they do not do that and they enter ihraam from Jeddah, then they have to slaughter a sheep and distribute its meat to the poor in Makkah. 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz was asked about this issue 
    and he said: 
They have to go back to their meeqaat if they 
    were coming for Hajj or ‘Umrah. It is not permissible for them to pass the meeqaat without entering ihraam, because when the Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) defined the meeqaat for the people of Madeenah, Syria, Najd and Yemen, etc, he said: “These are for them 
    [their people] and for anyone who is not of their people who come to them, wanting to do Hajj or ‘Umrah.”
 So they have to enter ihraam at the meeqaat 
    through which they pass, if they intend to do Hajj or ‘Umrah. If they pass the meeqaat then they have to go back to it. If they pass the meeqaat 
    and do not go back, and enter ihraam after that, then they have to offer a sacrifice. Similarly if they are unable to go back, they should enter 
    ihraam from the place they are in and they have to slaughter an animal that meets the conditions of sacrifice (udhiyah) and distribute its meat

36647,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/36647,Mistakes made when visiting the Prophet’s Mosque,What are the mistakes that people make when visiting the Prophet’s Mosque?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.The mistakes that some pilgrims make when visiting the Prophet’s Mosque are of several types: 
-1- 
Some pilgrims believe that visiting the Prophet’s Mosque is something that has to do with Hajj, and that Hajj is not valid without it. Some of the ignorant even think that it is more essential than Hajj. This is a false belief, because there is no connection between going for Hajj and visiting the Mosque of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Hajj is complete without it, and it is complete without Hajj, but since ancient times people have made the visit to the Prophet’s Mosque part of the journey to Hajj, because it is difficult to travel twice. But it is not more essential than Hajj, because Hajj is one of the pillars and basic principles of Islam, which is not the case with visiting the Prophet’s Mosque. We do not know of any scholar who said that it is obligatory to visit the Prophet’s Mosque or the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
With regard to the report which says that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever goes for Hajj and does not visit me has snubbed me,” these are words that are falsely attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and go against the well known teachings of Islam. If it were true then visiting his grave would be one of the most obligatory of duties. 
-2- 
Some visitors to the Prophet’s Mosque circumambulate the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and touch the grille and walls of the room. They may even kiss them and lay their cheeks against them. All of these are reprehensible innovations, for circumambulation (tawaaf) around anything other than the Ka’bah is a forbidden innovation (bid’ah). The same applies to touching, kissing or pressing one’s cheeks against the walls; such actions are prescribed only in the right areas of the Ka’bah. Worshipping Allaah by doing such actions at the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) will only take a person further away from Allaah. 
-3- 
Some visitors touch the mihrab, minbar and walls of the mosque to seek blessings. All of that is bid’ah. 
-4- 
This is the most serious mistake: 
Some visitors pray to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to relieve distress or to grant them something they desire. This is major shirk which puts a person beyond the pale of Islam, and Allaah and His Messenger do not approve of this. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And the mosques are for Allaah (Alone), so invoke not anyone along with Allaah”
[al-Jinn 72:18]
“And your Lord said: Invoke Me [i.e. believe in My Oneness (Islamic Monotheism) and ask Me for anything] I will respond to your (invocation). Verily, those who scorn My worship [i.e. do not invoke Me, and do not believe in My Oneness, (Islamic Monotheism)] they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!”
[Ghaafir 40:60]
 “Say: ‘It is not in my power to cause you harm, or to bring you to the Right Path’”
[al-Jinn 72:21]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) denounced a man who said “Whatever Allaah and you will.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Are you making me a rival with Allaah? What Allaah alone wills.” Narrated by Ibn Maajah 2118. So what about one who calls upon the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to relieve his distress and to bring him benefits, when he is the one to whom Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say (O Muhammad): ‘I possess no power over benefit or hurt to myself except as Allaah wills’”
[al-A’raaf 7:188]
“Say: ‘It is not in my power to cause you harm, or to bring you to the Right Path’”
[al-Jinn 72:21]? 
So the believer should put his hopes in his Creator Who has the power to fulfil his hopes and relieve him of his fears, and he should acknowledge the rights of his Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to be believed in, loved and followed , both outwardly and inwardly. He should ask Allaah to make him steadfast in that, and not seek to worship Allaah in any way other than that which He has prescribed.","From the words of Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen , Akhta’ Yaqa’ fiha al-Haaj wa’l-Mu’tamir"

Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “For one of you to be stabbed in the head with an iron needle is better for him than for him to touch a woman who is not permissible for him.”( Narrated by al-Tabarani from the hadith of Ma’qil ibn Yasar (may Allah have mercy on him); classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami’, 5045.) 
Hugging and kissing a non-mahram girl
If this applies to mere touching, then hugging and kissing are even more serious matters. If the woman tries to do that, the man must stop her, and not allow her to do something  haram with him. 
Does touching a girl break your fast?
This is a general ruling which applies to the one who is fasting and to others. But if a person is fasting, it is even more important that he keep away from all haram things and all things that can provoke desire, which go against the wisdom and aims of fasting. Allah says, explaining the reason why fasting has been enjoined (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Observing As-Sawm (the fasting) is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, that you may become Al-Muttaqun (the pious).” [al-Baqarah 2:183]
And Allah says in a hadith qudsi: “Fasting is for Me and I will reward for it. He gives up his desire and his food and drink for My sake.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 7492; Muslim, 1151) 
The one who has done that must repent to Allah and resolve never to do it again. 
With regard to his fast, that is subject to further discussion: 
If semen (maniy) came out of him because of this action, then his fast is invalidated and he must make up that day. If no semen came out of him , then his fast is still valid. 
But the fact that his fast is still valid does not mean that there is no sin on him or that his fast is perfect. Not at all. Rather every sin that a person commits detracts from the reward of his fast, and may cancel out the reward altogether. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does not give up false speech and false actions and ignorance , Allah has no need of his giving up his food and drink.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 6057) 
He also (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “A fasting person may get nothing from his fast except hunger and the one who prays at night may get nothing from his qiyam but a sleepless night.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah, 1690; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah)

But it is inevitable that among these sites there will be someone who puts some songs or something of that nature on his site. Is it obligatory to erase them, or can we simply advise him? If he refuses to erase them, then do I have to remove them? Please note that this will cause some damage to the reputation of my hosting service. I hope that you can explain this matter clearly.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    You have done well by stipulating that nothing should be 
    included that goes against Islamic sharee’ah. If you state some examples, 
    such as music, pictures of women and songs, that will be better, because 
    some of those who use the internet may be unaware that these things go 
    against sharee’ah. 

    Whether you stipulate these conditions or not, it is not 
    permissible for those who sign up with you to put anything haraam on their 
    sites, for disobedience to Allaah is something that must be avoided, and 
    that does not depend on conditions stipulated by anyone. The Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whatever I have forbidden 
    to you, avoid it.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 7288; Muslim, 1337. 

    It is not permissible for you to approve of anything that is 
    haraam, or to help the one who wants to put it on his site, for Allaah has 
    forbidden that when He said (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “but do not help one another in sin and transgression”

    [al-Maa'idah 5:2]

    The condition that has been stipulated is simply to reinforce 
    this message and make it clearer. 

    Based on this, if someone puts something haraam on his site, 
    you have to advise him and ask him to remove these files. If he responds, 
    all well and good, otherwise you have the right to remove them and not renew 
    his contract. 

    Do not worry about your reputation; it is sufficient to 
    please Allaah and be accepted by Him. 

    Al-Tirmidhi (2414) narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be 
    pleased with her) said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “Whoever seeks to please Allaah by 
    displeasing the people, Allaah will suffice him and protect him from the 
    people. But whoever seeks to please the people by displeasing Allaah, Allaah 
    will leave him to the people.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh 
    al-Tirmidhi. 

    In His hands are the treasures of the heavens and the earth, 
     

    “And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He 
    will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty).

So there are four days of sacrifice: the day of ‘Eid al-Adha and the three days after it. 
It is better to hasten to offer the sacrifice after the ‘Eid prayer , as the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to do, then the first thing he would eat on the day of ‘Eid would be meat from his sacrifice. 
Ahmad (22475) narrated that Buraydah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not go out on the day of (‘Eid) al-Fitr until he had eaten, and he did not eat on the day of (‘Eid) al-Adha until he came back, then he would eat from his sacrifice. 
Al-Zayla’i narrated in Nasb al-Rayah (2/221) that Ibn al-Qattan classed it as sahih. 
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Zad al-Ma'ad (2/319): 
“‘Ali ibn Abi Talib (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The days of sacrifice are the Day of Sacrifice (yawm al-nahr) and the three days after it.” This is the view of the imam of the people of Basra, al-Hasan; the imam of the people of Makkah, ‘Ata ibn Abi Rabah; the imam of the people of Syria, al-Awza’i; and the imam of the jurists of hadith, al-Shafi'i (may Allah have mercy on him). It was also the view favoured by Ibn al-Mundhir. The three days are specified because they are the days of Mina, the days of stoning (the Jamarat) and the days of al-Tashriq. It is forbidden to fast on these days. It was narrated via two isnads, one of which supports the other, that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “All of Mina is the place of sacrifice, and all the days of al-tashriq are days of sacrifice.” (The hadith was classed as sahih by al-Albani in al-Silsilah al-Sahihah, 2476)
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said in Ahkam al-Udhiyah, concerning the time for offering the sacrifice: 
“It is from after the ‘Eid prayer on the Day of Sacrifice until the sun sets on the last of the days of al-tashriq, which is the thirteenth of Dhu’l-Hijjah. So there are four days of sacrifice: the day of ‘Eid after the prayer, and three days after that. Whoever slaughters his sacrifice before the ‘Eid prayer is over, or after the sun sets on the thirteenth, his sacrifice is not valid … but if he has an excuse for delaying it until after the days of al-tashriq, such as if the animal ran away with no negligence on his part, and he did not find it until after the time was over, or if he delegated someone to do it on his behalf and his deputy forgot until the time was over, then there is nothing wrong with offering the sacrifice after the time has ended, because there is an excuse, by analogy with the fact that one who sleeps and misses a prayer or forgets it should offer the prayer as soon as he wakes up or remembers it. 
It is permissible to offer the sacrifice during that time by night or by day, but it is better during the day, and the day of ‘Eid after the two khutbahs is the best time. Each day is better than the following day, because that is hastening to do good.” 
It says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah (11/406): 
“The days of sacrifice for pilgrims performing qiran or tamattu’ , and for offering the sacrifice (udhiyah) are four: the day of ‘Eid and the three days after that. The time for sacrifice ends when the sun sets on the fourth day, according to the soundest scholarly opinion.”

What animals should be avoided in udhiyah?","Praise be to Allah.The best animals for udhiyah
The best types of animals for udhiyah are: camels, then cows – if sacrificed on behalf of one person; then sheep; then goats; then one-seventh of a camel; then one-seventh of a cow. The best types of animals are those which are fat and have more meat, and are physically complete and good looking. 
In Sahih al-Bukhari it is narrated from Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to sacrifice two horned rams that were white speckled with black. 
Abu Sa’id al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sacrificed a whole (i.e., not castrated), horned male sheep, with a black face and black (circles) round the eyes, and black legs. This was narrated by the four. Al-Tirmidhi said, it is hasan sahih; it was also classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud, 2796. 
Abu Rafi’, the freed slave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), said: When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) offered a sacrifice, he would buy two fat rams. According to one version, castrated rams. (Narrated by Ahmad, classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Ibn Majah, 3122)
Fat means an animal that has a lot of fat and meat. Castrated means one that has had its testicles removed – this is usually better than an uncastrated animal with regard to the taste of the meat, but the uncastrated animal is more complete in a physical sense. 
These are the best kinds of sacrifice with regard to type and characteristics. 
What animals should be avoided in udhiyah? 
With regard to those that are makruh to slaughter for sacrifice , they are as follows: 

Those who have had one half or more of their ears or horns cut off.
Those whose ears have been slit crosswise from the front.
Those whose ears have been slit crosswise from the back.
Those whose ears have been slit lengthwise.
Those whose ears have had a hole made in them.
Those whose ears have been cut until the ear channel is visible; or it was said that the same [Arabic] word means those that are so emaciated that there is no marrow in their bones.
Those whose horns have been removed entirely.
Those that are completely blind even though the eyes are still present.
Those which do not follow the flock and join it unless they are herded and driven to do so.

These are the animals that it is makruh to sacrifice, as narrated in the hadiths which forbid sacrificing those that have these faults or enjoin avoiding such animals. This is understood as meaning that it is makruh, when these reports are taken in conjunction with the hadith of al-Bara ibn ‘Azib (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was asked, “What should be avoided in the sacrificial animals ?” He gestured with his hand and said, “Four: a lame animal which is obviously lame, a one-eyed animal whose defect is obvious, a sick animal whose sickness is obvious, and an emaciated animal that no one would choose.” (Narrated by Malik in al-Muwatta) 
Animals with similar faults are also added to this list, so it is makruh to sacrifice the following kinds of animals: 

Camels, cattle and goats that have had half or more of their tails cut off.
Those which have had less than half of their fat tails cut off. If half or more has been cut off, then according to the majority of scholars it is unsuitable for sacrifice. If it was born that way, however, there is nothing wrong with it.
An animal whose penis has been cut off.
An animal that has lost some of its teeth, whether incisors or molars. But if it was born like that it is not makruh to sacrifice it.
An animal whose teats have been cut off. But if it was born like that it is not makruh to sacrifice it. If its milk has stopped flowing but its teats are intact, there is nothing wrong with it.

 If these five are added to the nine mentioned above, the number of makruh animals reaches fourteen.

36674,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/36674,Ruling on cursing specific people,"What is the ruling on cursing (and not just insulting) the Jews and Christians or other groups, whether living or dead? May Allah reward you with good.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The author of Lisaan al-‘Arab [a famous Arabic-language dictionary – Translator] said: La’n (curse) means being cast out far from goodness, and it was said that it means being cast away far from Allah, and from people. 
Cursing happens in two ways: 
Cursing the kuffaar and sin in general terms, such as saying “May Allah curse the Jews and Christians,” or “May Allah curse the kaafirs, evildoers and wrongdoers,” or “May Allah curse the wine-drinker and thief.” This kind of curse is permissible and there is nothing wrong with it. Ibn Muflih said in al-Adaab al-Shar’iyyah, 1/203: “It is permissible to curse the kuffaar in general.” 
The second is where the curse is applied to a specific person, whether he is a kaafir or an evildoer, such as saying, “May Allah curse So and so,” mentioning him by name. This may fall into one of two categories: 
1 – Where there is a text which states that he is cursed, such as Iblees, or where there is a text which states that he died as a kaafir, such as Pharaoh, Abu Lahab and Abu Jahl. Cursing such persons is permitted. 
Ibn Muflih said in al-Adaab al-Shar’iyyah, 1/214: “It is permissible to curse those concerning whom there is a text stating that they are cursed, but there is no sin involved if one does not do this.” 
2 – Cursing a particular kaafir or evildoer concerning whom there is no text stating that they are cursed – such as wine-drinkers, those who offer sacrifices to anything other than Allah, the one who curses his parents, those who introduce innovations in religion, and so on. 
“The scholars differed as to whether it is permissible to curse these people, and there are three points of view:
(i)That it is not permissible under any circumstances
(ii)That it is permissible in the case of a kaafir but not of a (Muslim) evildoer
(iii)That it is permissible in all cases.”
Al-Adaab al_Shar’iyyah by Ibn Muflih, 1/303 
Those who say that it is not permissible quoted a number of texts as evidence, including the following: 
1 – The report narrated by al-Bukhari (4070) from ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar, that he heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), when he raised his head from rukoo’ in the final rak’ah of Fajr prayer and said: “O Allah, curse So and so, and So and so, and So and so,” after he had said, “Sami’a Allahu li man hamidah, Rabbana wa laka’l-hamd.” Then Allah revealed the words (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Not for you (O Muhammad, but for Allah) is the decision; whether He turns in mercy to (pardons) them or punishes them; verily, they are the Zaalimoon (polytheists, disobedients and wrongdoers)” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:128]
2 – The report narrated by al-Bukhari (6780) from ‘Umar, that there was a man at the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) whose name was ‘Abd-Allah, but his nickname was Himaar (donkey), and he used to make the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) laugh. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had him (previously) flogged for drinking, then he was brought one day and he commanded that he be flogged, and a man who was there said, “O Allah, curse him, how often he is brought [for this reason]!” But the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not curse him, for by Allah what I know about him is that he loves Allah and His Messenger.” 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in Majmoo’ al-Fatawa, 6/511. 
It is permissible to curse all those whom Allah and His Messenger have cursed, but as for cursing specific people, if it is known that the person died in kufr, then it is permissible to curse him. But with regard to a specific [Muslim] evildoer, we should not curse him, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade cursing ‘Abd-Allah ibn Himaar who used to drink wine, even though he had cursed the wine-drinkers in general; however cursing a specific person if he is an evildoer or promoter of bid’ah is a point of dispute among the scholars. 
And Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said in al-Qawl al-Mufeed, 1/226. 
The difference between cursing a specific person and cursing those who commit sin in general is that the former (cursing a specific person) is not allowed, and the latter (cursing the people who commit sin in general) is allowed. So if you see an innovator, you do not say, ‘May Allah curse you,’ rather say, ‘May the curse of Allah be upon those who introduce innovations,’ in general terms. The evidence for that is the fact that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed some people among the mushrikeen and followers of jaahiliyyah and said: “O Allah, curse So and so, and So and so, and So and so,” he was told not to do that when Allah said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Not for you (O Muhammad, but for Allah) is the decision; whether He turns in mercy to (pardons) them or punishes them; verily, they are the Zaalimoon (polytheists, disobedients and wrongdoers)”[Aal ‘Imraan 3:128]
This was narrated by al-Bukhari.
