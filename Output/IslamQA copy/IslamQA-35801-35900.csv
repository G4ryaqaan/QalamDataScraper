35829,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/35829,She had an operation on her uterus,"If a woman has an operation on her uterus and bleeds as a result, is that blood regarded as menses?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    A woman may experience something that causes her to bleed 
    from her vagina, such as an operation on the uterus or close to it. This 
    falls into two categories: 

    1 – If she knows that it is not possible for her to 
    menstruate after the surgery, such as if she has an operation to remove the 
    uterus altogether (hysterectomy) or blocking it so that no blood can come 
    from it. This woman does not come under the rulings on istihaadah 
    (non-menstrual vaginal bleeding); rather she comes under the rulings on one 
    who sees some yellowish or brownish discharge or some wetness after her 
    period ends. So she should not stop praying and fasting, or refuse to let 
    her husband have intercourse with her, and she does not have to do ghusl in 
    this case. But when she wants to pray she should wash the blood from herself 
    and put a piece of cloth or something similar over her private part to 
    prevent the blood coming out, then she should do wudoo’ and pray. She should 
    only do wudoo’ after the time for the prayer has begun, if there is a 
    specific time for the prayer such as the five daily prayers, or when she 
    wants to offer a naafil prayer. 

    2 – If she knows that there is no reason why she should not 
    menstruate after the operation and it is possible that she may menstruate. 
    This comes under the ruling of istihaadah and is indicated by the words of 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to Faatimah 
    bint Hubaysh: “That is a vein and is not menses. When the time of menses 
    comes, then stop praying.” The words “when the time of menses comes” 
    indicate that the ruling on istihaadah may apply to one who has a period 
    that comes and goes. If a woman does not have a period then her bleeding is 
    regarded as coming from a vein in all cases. End quote.",Risaalah fi’l-Dima’ al-Tabee’iyyah li’l-Nisa’ by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him)
35853,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/35853,Ruling on offering the funeral prayer in absentia,"What is the ruling on offering the funeral prayer for the deceased in absentia? If it is allowed, then should the funeral prayer be offered in absentia in all cases?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is proven in al-Saheehayn that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came out to his companions the day the Negus, the king of Abyssinia (may Allah have mercy on him), died; told them the news of his death and he lined them up in rows and offered the funeral prayer. 
This hadeeth indicates that it is prescribed to offer the funeral prayer in absentia, but some of the scholars, such as the Hanafis and Maalikis said that this applied only to the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and it is not prescribed for anyone else to offer the funeral prayer in absentia. The majority of scholars rejected that, however, and said that whether or not a thing applies only to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) can only be proven with evidence, and the basic principle is that the ummah is enjoined to follow the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
The scholars who say that it is prescribed to offer the funeral prayer in absentia differed as to whether this should be done in all cases or not. All of them quoted the fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) offered the funeral prayer for the Negus in absentia as evidence. 
The Shaafa’is and Hanbalis are of the view that it is prescribed to offer the funeral prayer in absentia for everyone who dies away from his home town, even if the funeral prayer is offered for him in the place where he dies. 
The second view is that it is prescribed to offer the funeral prayer in absentia if the deceased had benefited the Muslims in some way, such as a scholar, a mujaahid or a rich man from whose wealth the people benefited, and so on. 
This view was narrated from Imam Ahmad, and it is the view favoured by Shaykh al-Sa’di, and is mentioned in fatwas issued by the Standing Committee. 
The third view is that it is prescribed to offer the funeral prayer in absentia so long as the funeral prayer has not been offered for the deceased in the place where he died. If the funeral prayer has been offered for him, then it is not prescribed to offer the funeral prayer for him in absentia.  
This view is the other view narrated from Imam Ahmad. It was also favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and his student Ibn al-Qayyim, and among later scholars it was favoured by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen. 
There follow some comments of the scholars on this issue: 
Al-Khurshi (Maaliki) said (2/142): The fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) offered the funeral prayer for the Negus (in absentia) is one of the things that applied only to him. 
Something similar was stated in Badaa’i al-Sanaa’i by al-Kasaani (Hanafi) (1/312). 
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Majmoo’ (5/211): Our view is that it is permissible to offer the funeral prayer for one died away from his home town, but Abu Haneefah disallowed it. Our evidence is the hadeeth about the Negus, which is saheeh and has no faults, and they do not have any valid answer to that. End quote. 
Al-Shaafa’i imposed a valid restriction on offering the funeral prayer in absentia, which is that the one who offers the funeral prayer for the deceased should be one of those who would have offered the prayer for him the day he died.  
Zakariya al-Ansaari (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Asna al-Mataalib (1/322): Offering the funeral prayer for one who died away from his home town is only permissible for those who would have prayed for him the day he died. End quote. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: But some of the scholars imposed a valid restriction and said: so long as the one who has been buried died at a time when the one who is praying for him was qualified to pray. 
For example: a man died twenty years ago, and a person who is thirty years old goes out and offers the funeral prayer for him – this is valid, because when the man died, the one who is praying for him was ten years old, so he is qualified to offer the funeral prayer for the deceased. 
Another example: A man died thirty years ago, and a person who is twenty years old goes out and offers the funeral prayer for him. This is not valid, because the one who is praying did not exist at the time when the man died, so he is not qualified to offer the funeral prayer for him. 
So it is not prescribed for us to offer the funeral prayer over the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). We have never known any of the scholars saying that it is prescribed for a person to offer the funeral prayer at the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or at the graves of the Sahaabah, rather what is prescribed is to stand and say du’aa’ for them. End quote. 
Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (2/195): 
It is permissible to offer the funeral prayer in absentia for one who is in another land, by forming the intention then turning to face the qiblah, and offering the funeral prayer as one would offer it for one who is present, whether the deceased is lying in the direction of the qiblah or not, and whether there is a short distance between the two places or not. This is the view of al-Shaafa’i. End quote. 
Al-Mardaawi said in al-Insaaf (2/533): The funeral prayer may be offered in absentia with the right intention. This is our view with regard to all cases (i.e., whether the funeral prayer has already been offered or him or not, and whether he benefited the Muslim masses or not). This is the view of the majority of our companions and many of them were definite about that. And it was narrated from Imam Ahmad that it is not permissible to offer the funeral prayer in absentia. And it was said that the funeral prayer may be offered if it has not yet been offered, otherwise it should not be done. This is the view favoured by Shaykh Taqiy al-Deen and Ibn ‘Abd al-Qawiy. End quote. 
Shaykh al-Bassaam (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Nayl al-Ma’aarib (1/324): 
The scholars differed concerning offering the funeral prayer in absentia. Abu Haneefah and Maalik and their followers were of the view that it is not prescribed, and they responded to the story of the Negus and the prayer that was offered for him by noting that this was something that applied only to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
Al-Shaafa’i and Ahmad and their followers are of the view that it is prescribed, and they quote two saheeh hadeeths as evidence. Whether or not a thing applies only to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) requires evidence, and there is no evidence in this case. Shaykh al-Islam adopted a middle path and said: If the funeral prayer has not been offered for the absent one, as in the case of the Negus, then it may be offered, but if the funeral prayer has been offered for him, then the communal obligation (fard kafaayah) no longer applies to the Muslims. 
This view was also mentioned in a saheeh narration from Imam Ahmad, which was classed as saheeh by Ibn al-Qayyim in al-Hadiy, because some of the Companions died at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when they were away from him, and there is no proof that he offered the funeral prayer for any of them in absentia. 
Shaykh al-Islam narrated that Imam Ahmad said: If a righteous man dies, then the funeral prayer may be offered for him, and he quoted as evidence the story of the Negus. 
This view was favoured by our shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Sa’di (may Allah have mercy on him), and this is what is done in Najd, where they offer the funeral prayer for any virtuous person who benefited the Muslims, and they leave anybody else. The prayer in this case is mustahabb. End quote. 
Al-Khattaabi said:  The funeral prayer should not be offered in absentia except if a person dies in a land where there is no one to offer the prayer for him. Al-Rooyaani, a Shaafa’i scholar, favoured this view, and Abu Dawood used a heading in al-Sunan that referred to this meaning when he said: “Chapter on offering the funeral prayer for a Muslim living among the mushrikeen in another land.” Al-Haafiz said: This is possibly correct. End quote from Fath al-Baari. 
The Standing Committee (8/418) was asked: Is it permissible for us to offer the funeral prayer for the deceased in absentia as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did for his beloved the Negus, or did that apply only to him? 
They replied: 
It is permissible to offer the funeral prayer in absentia because the Prophet did that, and this does not apply only to him, because his companions (may Allah be pleased with them) also prayed for the Negus with him, and because the basic principle is that things do not apply only to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), but that should be done only for those who made a contribution to Islam, not for everyone. End quote. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: It is proven that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) offered the funeral prayer for the Negus in absentia, and the reason for that was that there were no Muslims there who could pray for him. Now the Muslims may die in groups and there is no one to pray for them, as happens nowadays, and there is certainty that no one has offered the funeral prayer for them?
He replied: If you are certain that no one has offered the funeral prayer for them, then pray for them, because the funeral prayer is a communal obligation, but probably his family have offered the funeral prayer for him, because the funeral prayer may be offered by one person. Whatever the case, if you are certain that nobody has offered the funeral prayer for him, then you have to offer the prayer for him, because it is a communal obligation which must be discharged. End quote. From Majmoo’ Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (17/149) 
From the above it is clear that offering the funeral prayer in absentia is prescribed, because it is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his companions prayed for the Negus, and there is no evidence to prove that this is something that applied only to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). But the soundest views on this matter are two: 
1 – That the funeral prayer should not offered in absentia except for one for whom it has not been offered. 
2 – That the funeral prayer may be offered in absentia for one who has benefited the Muslims, such as a scholar from whose knowledge the people benefited, or a businessman from whose wealth the people benefited, or a mujaahid from whose jihad the people benefited, and so on.

The one who has no patience has no faith. For more about the Quranic verses and Prophetic hadiths that speak about the virtues of patience in Islam, see the detailed answer.","Quranic verses on the virtues of patience


Hadiths on the virtues of patience","Praise be to Allah.“Allah has made patience like a horse that never gets tired, an army that can never be defeated and a strong fortress that can never be breached. Patience and victory are twin brothers, for victory comes with patience, relief comes with distress and ease comes with hardship. Patience is of more help to the one who has it than men, as it helps without any need for equipment or numbers and its relationship to victory is like that of the head to the body. 
Quranic verses on the virtues of patience
In the Quran, Allaah has guaranteed those who are patient that He will give them reward without measure.  
He tells them that He is with them by guiding and supporting them and granting them a clear victory. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):                                                                    
“Surely, Allah is with those who are As-Sabirun (the patient).” [al-Anfal 8:46] 
Allah has made leadership in terms of religion conditional upon patience and certain faith, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):   
“And We made from among them (Children of Israel), leaders, giving guidance under Our Command, when they were patient and used to believe with certainty in Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.)” [al-Sajdah 32:24] 
Allah tells us that patience is better for those who are patient, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“But if you endure patiently, verily, it is better for As-Sabirun (the patient).” [al-Nahl 16:126] 
Allah tells us if we are patient and pious, the plot of the enemy cannot do any harm, even if he is powerful, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“But if you remain patient and become Al-Muttaqun (the pious), not the least harm will their cunning do to you. Surely, Allah surrounds all that they do.” [Al ‘Imran 3:120]  
Allah tells us that the patience and piety of his Prophet Yusuf brought him to a position of power and strength, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, he who fears Allah with obedience to Him (by abstaining from sins and evil deeds, and by performing righteous good deeds), and is patient, then surely, Allah makes not the reward of the Muhsinun (good-doers) to be lost.” [Yusuf 12:90] 
Allah has connected success to patience and piety, and the believers understand that. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Endure and be more patient (than your enemy), and guard your territory by stationing army units permanently at the places from where the enemy can attack you, and fear Allah, so that you may be successful.” [Al ‘Imran 3:200] 
Allah tells us that He loves those who are patient, and that is the greatest encouragement. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And Allah loves As-Saabirun (the patient).” [Al ‘Imran 3:146] 
Allah has given glad tidings of three things to those who are patient, each of which is better than that for which the people of this world envy one another. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“but give glad tidings to As- Sabirun (the patient). Who, when afflicted with calamity, say: ‘Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return.’ They are those on whom are the Salawat (i.e. who are blessed and will be forgiven) from their Lord, and (they are those who) receive His Mercy, and it is they who are the guided ones.” [al-Baqarah 2:155-157] 
Allah exhorts His slaves to seek help with patience and prayer when facing calamities that may befall a person. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And seek help in patience and As-Salah (the prayer) and truly, it is extremely heavy and hard except for Al-Khashi‘un [i.e. the true believers in Allah — those who obey Allah with full submission, fear much from His punishment, and believe in His Promise (Paradise) and in His Warnings (Hell)].” [al-Baqarah 2:45] 
Allah states that the victory of attaining Paradise and being saved from Hell will be won only by those who are patient, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, I have rewarded them this Day for their patience; they are indeed the ones that are successful.” [al-Mu'minun 23:111]  
Allah tells us that the desire to earn His reward and to turn away from this world and its adornments is attained only by those who are patient and are believers. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“But those who had been given (religious) knowledge said: “Woe to you! The reward of Allah (in the Hereafter) is better for those who believe and do righteous good deeds, and this none shall attain except those who are As-Sabirun (the patient in following the truth).” [al-Qasas 28:80] 
Allah tells us that repelling evil with that which is better makes the evildoer become like a close friend. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The good deed and the evil deed cannot be equal. Repel (the evil) with one which is better (i.e. Allah orders the faithful believers to be patient at the time of anger, and to excuse those who treat them badly) then verily he, between whom and you there was enmity, (will become) as though he was a close friend.” [Fussilat 41:34] 
“But this is something that “none is granted it (the above quality) except those who are patient — and none is granted it except the owner of the great portion (of happiness in the Hereafter, i.e., Paradise and of a high moral character) in this world.” [Fussilat 41:35] 
Allah tells us, and reinforces it with an oath, (interpretation of the meaning): 
“By Al-‘Asr (the time). Verily, man is in loss, Except those who believe (in Islamic Monotheism) and do righteous good deeds, and recommend one another to the truth [i.e. order one another to perform all kinds of good deeds (Al-Ma‘ruf) which Allah has ordained, and abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds (Al-Munkar) which Allah has forbidden], and recommend one another to patience (for the sufferings, harms, and injuries which one may encounter in Allah’s Cause during preaching His religion of Islamic Monotheism or Jihad).” [al-‘Asr 103] 
Allah will divide His creation into two categories: those who are on the right hand and those who are on the left hand (cf. al-Waqi’ah 56:8ff); those who are on the right hand are those who recommend one another to patience and mercy. 
Allah has chosen the people of patience and gratitude to benefit from His signs and be distinguished by this great good fortune. He says in four places in His Book (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Truly, therein are Ayat (evidences, proofs and signs) for every patient, thankful (person).” [Ibrahim 14:5; Luqman 31:31; Saba 24:19; al-Shura 42:33]  
Allah has made forgiveness and reward conditional upon doing righteous deeds and being patient, and that is easy for the one for whom He makes it easy. Allah says:  
“Except those who show patience and do righteous good deeds: those, theirs will be forgiveness and a great reward (Paradise).” [Hud 11:11] 
Allah tells us that patience and forgiveness are among the things recommended by Allah and those who pay heed to this will never lose, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And verily, whosoever shows patience and forgives, that would truly be from the things recommended by Allah.” [al-Shura 42:43] 
Allah commanded His Messenger to wait patiently for His Decision, and told him that his patience is not but from Him, and by virtue of patience all calamities become easy, as He said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So wait patiently (O Muhammad) for the Decision of your Lord, for verily, you are under Our Eyes.” [al-Tur 52:48] 
And He said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And endure you patiently (O Muhammad), your patience is not but from Allah. And grieve not over them (polytheists and pagans), and be not distressed because of what they plot. Truly, Allah is with those who fear Him (keep their duty unto Him), and those who are Muhsinun (good-doers).” [al-Nahl 16:127] 
Patience is the foundation of the believer’s faith which has no other foundation. The one who has no patience has no faith, and if he has any, then it is only a little faith and it is very weak, and such a person worships Allah as it were upon the edge (i.e. in doubt): if good befalls him, he is content therewith; but if a trial befalls him he turns back on his face (i.e. reverts to disbelief after embracing Islam). He loses both this world and the Hereafter (cf. al-Hajj 22:11). All he gets from them is a losing deal. 
The best life is attained by the blessed through patience, and they rise to the highest degrees through their gratitude. So they fly on the wings of patience and gratitude to gardens of delight (i.e., Paradise). That is the bounty of Allah that He bestows upon whomsoever He will, and Allah is the Owner of Great Bounty.”  (‘Uddat al-Sabireen by Ibn al-Qayyim, pp. 3-5) 
Hadiths on the virtues of patience
With regard to the ahadeeth which speak of the virtue of patience, they include the following: 
Al-Bukhari (1496) and Muslim (1053) narrated that Abu Sa’id al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “…whoever is patient Allah will bestow patience upon him, and no one is ever given anything better and more generous than patience.” 
Muslim (918) narrated that Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: I heard the Messenger of Allah say: “There is no Muslim who is stricken with a calamity and says what Allah has enjoined – ‘Verily to Allah we belong and unto Him is our return. O Allah, reward me for my affliction and compensate me with something better’ – but Allah will compensate him with something better.”  
Muslim (2999) narrated that Suhayb (may Allah be pleased with him)said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “How wonderful is the affair of the believer, for his affairs are all good, and this applies to no one but the believer. If something good happens to him, he is thankful for it and that is good for him. If something bad happens to him, he bears it with patience and that is good for him.” 
For more ahadeeth about the virtues of patience and exhortation to be patient, please see al-Targhib wa’l-Tarhib by al-Mundhiri (4/274-302). 
‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Aziz (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Allah has not bestowed any blessing upon His slaves then taken it away and replaced it with patience, but what He has compensated them with is better than what He has taken away.

35889,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/35889,Who is the wayfarer who may be given zakaah?,Can a traveller who does not have any money with which to travel be given zakaah because he is a wayfarer?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The wayfarer (ibn al-sabeel) is the traveller who has 
    become stranded, i.e., he does not have enough money to continue his 
    journey. He may be given zakaah to help him reach his destination. 

    But if he is in his homeland and wants to travel, then he is 
    not a wayfarer, and he cannot be given zakaah on that basis. But if his trip 
    is for an urgent reason such as medical treatment, and he does not have 
    enough money to travel, then he may be given zakaah from the share of the 
    poor, not from the share of the wayfarers. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:

     The wayfarer is called ibn al-sabeel (lit. “son of 
    the road”) because he sticks to the road, and the one who sticks to 
    something is described as its son in Arabic. So what is meant by ibn 
    al-sabeel is the traveller who is still travelling, the traveller who has 
    become stranded or cut off, i.e., he has lost his money and he does not have 
    enough to enable him to reach his home. 

    The wayfarer should be given according to his need; it is not 
    essential that he have no money.  

    Hence we say that we should give zakaah to the wayfarer, even 
    if he is among the richest of people in his homeland, because he has become 
    stranded and because he is in need in this situation. We do not tell him: 
    you are rich so borrow money. He should be given whatever will help him 
    reach his homeland. This may vary, so we should take his situation into 
    account so that he will not feel humiliated. 

    If he is one of those who are used to travelling first class, 
    should he be given first class or economy? 

    This is a disputed matter, but it is most likely that he 
    should be given that which will not cause him discomfort and humiliation. 

    It makes no difference whether the journey is long or short. 

    As for the one who is setting out on a journey from his home, 
    he should not be given zakaah, because the one who is setting out on a 
    journey from his home cannot truthfully be called a wayfarer. If he says “I 
    need to travel to Madeenah” but he does not have any money, then we cannot 
    give him zakaah on the grounds that he is a wayfarer, because he cannot 
    truthfully be described as such. But if his trip to Madeenah is because of a 
    need, such as medical treatment, and he does not have any money with which 
    to travel, then he may be given zakaah on another basis, namely poverty. End
