But four necessary conditions apply:
 The first is that one should be serious about marriage; the second is that the man and woman should not be alone; the third is that there should be no fear of fitnah (temptation); and the fourth is that it should not go beyond the limits set by sharee’ah, i.e., looking at what usually appears, which is what she shows to her father, brother and other mahrams. See Question #2572. On this basis, a man should not look at any woman except the one whom he seriously wants to marry. If he is pleased with her, (he should proceed with marriage), otherwise he should move on to another.

5511,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/5511,Is It Compulsory For Men to Get Married?,Is it obligatory for men to get married?,"Marriage is obligatory on the man who is (financially and physically) able to marry and longs to get married, and fears falling into sin, because it is obligatory to protect oneself from committing forbidden deeds and to keep himself chaste – and this can only be achieved through marriage.",,"Praise be to Allah.The ruling on marriage for men differs according to their situations and circumstances. Marriage is obligatory on the man who is (financially and physically) able to marry and longs to get married, and fears “hardship” otherwise, because it is obligatory for him to protect himself from committing forbidden deeds and to keep himself chaste – and this can only be achieved through marriage.
Al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“If a person is able to marry and fears that he may be harmed or his religious commitment may be adversely affected if he remains single, the only way to prevent this harm is through marriage, and there is no difference of opinion among the scholars – they agree that marriage is obligatory on such a person.
Al-Mardawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his book Al-Insaf: Part Three: the one who fears “hardship”. In the case of such a person, marriage is obligatory, and this is the unanimous opinion of the scholars… “Hardship” here means zina (fornication), according to the correct opinion. Or it was said that it means being doomed by committing zina … What is meant by “Unless he fears that he may fall into committing forbidden actions” means, if he knows or thinks that he will do that. In Al-Furu’ it says: (marriage) becomes obligatory only when he is sure that he will do that.” (Al-Insaf, part 8; Kitab Al-Nikah, Ahkam Al-Nikah)
If he wants to get married but is unable to spend on a wife, then he should adhere to the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning):
“And let those who find not the financial means for marriage keep themselves chaste, until Allah enriches them of His Bounty.” [Al-Nur 24:33]
So he should fast a lot, because of the Hadith narrated from Ibn Mas’ud who said that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “O young people, whoever among you can afford to get married, let him do so, for it helps one to lower the gaze and protect the private parts (i.e., remain chaste). Whoever cannot afford it, let him fast, for it is a protection for him.”
‘Umar said to Abu’l-Zawaid: “Nothing is stopping you from getting married except incapacity or immorality.” (See Fiqh Al-Sunnah, 2/15-17)
Marriage is obligatory on anyone who is single and committing sins such as looking (at women) or kissing. If a man or a woman knows or thinks it most likely that if he does not get married he will commit zina – or whatever comes under the same rulings or is similar to it, such as masturbation , then marriage is obligatory. 
It is still obligatory even if a person knows that he will still sin after marriage, because once he is married he will be less likely to sin, because he will be distracted from it at least part of the time, whereas if he remains single he will sin all the time.
Anyone who looks at the state of things in our times, how there is so much immorality and so much temptation, will be convinced that the obligation to marry is even more important now than at any time in the past. We ask Allah to purify our hearts, keep us away from haram things and help us to be chaste.

And We have enjoined on man to be good and dutiful to his
    parents [al-Ankaboot 29:8]
give thanks to Me and to your parents [Luqmaan 31:14]
Abu Amr al-Shaybaani said: I asked the Messenger of Allaah 
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) which deed was most beloved to Allaah. He
    said: Prayer performed at the right time. He asked, Then
    what? He said, Honouring one's parents. He said, Then what?
    He said, Jihaad for the sake of Allaah. (al-Bukhaari, 5970)
    Ibn Hajar said in Al-Fath (10/401): The
    Aayah implies that one should honour and obey one's parents even if they are Kaafirs. The
    Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) explained with regard to another
    hadeeth that it is good to honour one's parents even after they have died. It was reported
    that Abd-Allaah ibn Umar met a Bedouin man on the way to Makkah.
    Abd-Allaah greeted him with salaam, mounted him on the donkey he was riding, and
    gave him a turban that he had been wearing on his head. Ibn Deenaar said, we said to him,
    May Allaah bring you back to your senses! They are only Bedouin and they would be content
    with little. Abd-Allaah said: this mans father used to be a friend of
    Umar ibn al-Khattaab, and I heard the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him) say that the best of good deeds is for a son to uphold ties with his
    fathers friends. (Saheeh Muslim, 4629). Al-Ubayy said in his
    commentary on Muslim (8/496): this means that the best good deed is to give preference to
    one's fathers relatives over others.
    As for the sons rights over his mother, these include a good
    upbringing, kind treatment and compassion, which involves fully breastfeeding the child,
    educating him and spending on him if the father is not present.
With regard to your mothers rejection of the girl you wanted to
    marry, you have to find out the reasons why your mother did not like her, because a
    persons judgement is a reflection of the impressions he or she has. Perhaps your
    mother looks at the matter from a different angle than you do. Perhaps she rejected this
    girl for a reason that is quite legitimate from an Islamic point of view, such as the girl
    not being committed to Islam. Maybe after researching the matter and consulting with
    others, she found out that this girl was not the right one for you; in this case you
    should obey her.
But if your mother rejected her on the basis of her own whims, and not
    for any reason that has to do with Shareeah, or she rejected her because she (the
    girl) is strongly committed to Islam, then in this case you do not have to obey your
    mother, but you should try to win her over gently. You could get some good people whom she
    respects to intervene in the matter if you wish. And Allaah is the source of strength.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

However, a non-Muslim that I had a discussion with pointed out that this is not mentioned in the Quran. Upon investigating this matter, it seems that the Quran is ambiguous as to which son is intended to be sacrificed (as least in my English translation-surah 37). Please explain the Muslim position on Prophet Ibrahim and the sacrifice, using textual evidence.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Allaah says of His slave and Close Friend (Khaleel) Ibraaheem (peace be
    upon him) (interpretation of the meaning):
And he said (after his rescue from the fire):
    “Verily, I am going to my Lord. He will guide me!”
“My Lord! Grant me (offspring) from the
    righteous.”
So We gave him the glad tidings of a forbearing boy.
And, when he (his son) was old enough to walk with
    him, he said: “O my son! I have seen in a dream that I am slaughtering you (offering
    you in sacrifice to Allaah). So look what you think!” He said: “O my father! Do
    that which you are commanded, In shaa’ Allaah (if Allaah wills), you shall find me of
    As-Saabiroon (the patient).”
Then, when they had both submitted themselves (to the
    Will of Allaah), and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead (or on the side of his
    forehead for slaughtering);
We called out to him: “O Ibraaheem!
You have fulfilled the dream!” Verily, thus do We
    reward the Muhsinoon (good-doers).
Verily, that indeed was a manifest trial.
And We ransomed him with a great sacrifice (i.e. a
    ram);
And We left for him (a goodly remembrance) among the
    later generations.
“Salaam (peace) be upon Ibraaheem!”
Thus indeed do We reward the Muhsinoon (good-doers).
Verily, he was one of Our believing slaves.
And We gave him the glad tidings of Ishaaq (Isaac)  a Prophet from the righteous.
We blessed him and Ishaaq (Isaac). And of their
    progeny are (some) that do right, and some that plainly wrong themselves.”
    [al-Saaffaat 37:99-113)
Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Allaah tells us that
    when His Close Friend (Khaleel) Ibraaheem migrated from the land of his people, he asked
    his Lord to grant him a righteous son, so Allaah gave him the glad tidings of a forbearing
    boy. This was Ismaa’eel (peace be upon him), because he was the first child who was
    born (to Ibraaheem, peace be upon him). There is no dispute on this point among the
    followers of the various religions [Jews, Christians and Muslims], that (Ismaa’eel)
    was the first child born to Ibraaheem.
“And, when he (his son) was old enough to walk with him” means,
    when he grew up and was able to take care of himself, like his father. Mujaahid said: “And,
    when he (his son) was old enough to walk with him” means, when he grew up and was
    able to ride and walk and work like his father did. When this happened, then Ibraaheem
    (peace be upon him) saw a dream in which he was commanded to sacrifice this son of his.
    According to a hadeeth narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas and attributed to the Prophet 
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “The dreams of the Prophets are Wahy
    (revelation).” So Allaah was testing His Close Friend by commanding him to sacrifice
    this beloved son who had come to him in his old age, when he was very old, and after he
    had been commanded to settle the child and his mother in the desert, in a valley in which
    there was no noise, no people, no vegetation and no animals. So Ibraaheem obeyed the
    command of Allaah and left them there, putting his trust in Allaah, and Allaah sent them
    provision, from an unexpected source. After all that, when Ibraaheem was ordered to
    sacrifice this son of his, who was his firstborn and his only child, he responded to his
    Lord and obeyed His command, hastening to do as He willed. So he told his son about it so
    as to put him at ease and not sacrifice him by force.
“He said: ‘O my son! I have seen in a dream that I am
    slaughtering you (offering you in sacrifice to Allaah). So look what you
    think!’” The forbearing boy immediately responded: “He said: ‘O
    my father! Do that which you are commanded, In shaa’ Allaah (if Allaah wills), you
    shall find me of As-Saabiroon (the patient).’” This was the best answer he
    could give, an example of obedience to his father and to the Lord of mankind. Allaah said
    (interpretation of the meaning):
“Then, when they had both submitted themselves (to the Will of
    Allaah), and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead (or on the side of his forehead for
    slaughtering).” It was said that “when they had both submitted themselves”
    meant when they had both surrendered to the command of Allaah. “and he had laid
    him prostrate on his forehead” means that he put him face down. It was said that
    he wanted to slaughter him from behind so that he would not see his face at the time of
    slaughter. This was the view of Ibn ‘Abbaas, Mujaahid, Sa’eed ibn Jubayr,
    Qutaadah and al-Dahhaak… “They both submitted themselves” means that
    Ibraaheem said Bismillaahi’r-Rahmaan ir-Raheem and said Allaahu akbar
    and the boy said La ilaaha ill-Allaah because he was about to die. Al-Saddi and
    others said that (Ibraaheem) passed the knife over the boy’s throat but it did not
    cut him at all. It was said that a sheet of copper was placed between the knife and his
    throat, and Allaah knows best. Then it was called out from Allaah:
“’O Ibraaheem! You have fulfilled the dream!’” meaning,
    the purpose has been achieved, you have been tested and your obedience and willingness to
    do what your Lord commands have been proven. An alternative sacrifice will be provided
    instead of your son, just as you willingly submitted your body to the flames and you spent
    your wealth to honour your guests. Hence Allaah said:
“Verily, that indeed was a manifest trial” meaning
    that it was an obvious test.
“And We ransomed him with a great sacrifice” means, We
    provided a ransom for his son, an alternative to be sacrificed in his stead. According to
    the best known opinion of the majority of scholars, this was a fine white horned ram.
    Al-Thawri narrated from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Uthmaan ibn Khaytham from Sa’eed
    ibn Jubayr that Ibn ‘Abbaas said: It was a ram that had grazed in Paradise for forty
    years.
It was also narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas that the dried ram’s
    head was still hanging on the downspout of the Ka’bah. This alone is evidence that
    the one who was to be sacrificed was Ismaa’eel, because he was the one who was
    settled in Makkah and we have never heard that Ishaaq ever came to Makkah from the time he
    was little. And Allaah knows best.
See Al-Bidaayah wa’l-Nihaayah by Ibn Katheer, 1/157-158
The one who was to be sacrificed was Ismaa’eel and not Ishaaq,
    because of the reasons stated above. In his Tafseer (commentary) on these Ayaat,
    Ibn Katheer also mentioned a number of points which prove that it was Ismaa’eel who
    was to be sacrificed. These points may be summed up as follows:
Ismaa’eel was the first child of whom glad tidings were given to
        Ibraaheem. He was older than Ishaaq according to the consensus of the Muslims and the
        People of the Book (Jews and Christians). According to the scriptures of the People of the
        Book, it was stated that Allaah commanded Ibraaheem to sacrifice his only son, and in some
        manuscripts it says that he was to sacrifice his first-born son.

The first son is usually more dear than other children, so the command
        to sacrifice him is a more exacting test.

It is mentioned that glad tidings of a forbearing boy were given, and
        that he was the one who was to be sacrificed. Later in the passage it says (interpretation
        of the meaning): “And We gave him the glad tidings of Ishaaq (Isaac)  a Prophet from the righteous.” When the angels brought
        the glad tidings of Ishaaq to Ibraaheem, they said: “We give you glad tidings of a
        boy (son) possessing much knowledge and wisdom” [al-Hijr 15:53 – interpretation
        of the meaning].

Allâh said (interpretation of the meaning): “But We gave her
        glad tidings of Ishaaq, and after him, of Ya’qoob.” (Hood 11:71) meaning
        that a child called Ya’qoob would be born during their (Sara and Ishaaq’s)
        lifetimes, and he would have many descendents… and it does not sound right for
        Ibraaheem to be commanded to sacrifice him when he was little, because Allaah had promised
        that he would have many descendents.

Ismaa’eel is described here (in Soorat al-Saffaat) as being
        “forbearing” because this is very appropriate in this context.

    understood by the Companions of the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him) and their followers among the scholars who are qualified
    and prominent mujtahids. This includes the imaams whose sincerity, fairness
    and leadership in religion, knowledge, virtue, goodness and righteousness is

    fiqh (Imaam Abu Haneefah, Imaam Maalik, Imaam al-Shaafa’i and Imaam Ahmad)
    – may Allaah have mercy on them all – all followed the texts of the
    Sharee’ah and their efforts were all focused on teaching and spreading
    sound Islamic knowledge. All of them were on the right path, and all were
    devoted followers of the Prophet

    to be followed in Sharee’ah are those for which evidence (daleel) is
    established. In some cases, some scholars may not have known of daleel
    whilst others did, but this does not mean that their knowledge and ability
    is to be discredited. All of them were seeking to find and propagate the
    truth. If a person wants to follow one of the Imaams and adopt his madhhab,
    then he should follow him in matters for which there is clear, sound daleel,
    for this is what is required in Islam, but he should not develop partisan or
    sectarian feelings towards anybody. It is not permissible for the Muslim to
    believe that he has to follow anybody in all that he says except the Prophet

The person who is suitably qualified can examine what the
    scholars said and see what is supported by sound daleel. The “rank and

Mahrams by ties of blood


Mahrams by breastfeeding


Mahrams by marriage","Praise be to Allah.It is permissible for a woman to take off her hijab in front of her mahrams.
Who is a woman’s mahram?
A woman’s mahram is a person whom she is never permitted to marry because of their close blood relationship (such as her father, grandfather, great-grandfather, etc., and her son, grandson, great-grandson, etc., her paternal and maternal uncles, her brother, brother’s son and sister’s son), or because of breastfeeding (such as the brother and husband of the woman who breastfed her), or because they are related by marriage (such as the mother’s husband, the husband’s father, grandfather, etc., and the husband’s son, grandson, etc.). More details on this subject are given below:
Mahrams by ties of blood
These are the ones mentioned in Surah al-Nur, where Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“… and not to reveal their adornment except to their husbands, or their fathers, or their husband’s fathers, or their sons, or their husband’s sons, or their brothers or their brother’s sons, or their sister’s sons…” [al-Nur 24:31]
The mufassirin said: the woman’s male mahrams by ties of blood, as stated clearly in this verse or inferred by it are as follows:

the woman’s forefathers, no matter how far back the line of ascent goes through her father and her mother, such as her father’s forefathers and her mother’s forefathers. As for her husband’s forefathers, they are her mahrams by marriage, as we shall see below.
her sons, which includes her children’s children, no matter how the line of descent goes and whether they are descended from males or females, such as her sons’ sons and her daughters’ sons. As for her “husband’s sons” mentioned in the ayah, these are the husband’s sons from other wives, and these are her mahrams by marriage, not by blood, as we shall see below.
her brothers, whether they are her brothers through both the mother and father, or through the father only or the mother only.
the children of her siblings, whether they are descended through the males or females, such as the sons of her sister’s daughters.
paternal uncles and maternal uncles. They are mahrams by blood even though they are not mentioned in the ayah, because they are like parents and are regarded by people as having the same status as parents, and a paternal uncle may be called a father. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):

“Or were you witnesses when death approached Ya‘qub (Jacob)? When he said unto his sons, “What will you worship after me?” They said, “We shall worship your Ilah (God — Allah) the Ilah (God) of your fathers, Ibrahim (Abraham), Isma’il (Ishmael), Ishaq (Isaac)…” [al-Baqarah 2:133]. Isma’il was the paternal uncle of the sons of Ya’qub.
(Tafsir al-Razi, 23/206; Tafsir al-Qurtubi, 12/232, 233; Tafsir al-Alusi, 18/143; Fath al-Bayan fi Maqasid al-Quran by Siddiq Hasan Khan, 6/352)
Mahrams by breastfeeding
A woman may have mahrams through rada'ah. It says in Tafsir al-Alusi:
“The relationship of mahram which permits a woman to show her adornments may be through rada'ah as well as through blood ties, so it is permissible for a woman to show her adornments to those who are her fathers or sons through rada'ah.” (Tafsir al-Alusi. 18/143) 
The relationship of mahram by rada'ah is like the relationship of mahram by blood – it means that marriage is forever forbidden by virtue of that relationship of mahram. This was the view stated by Imam al-Jassas when he commented on this verse. He said (may Allah have mercy on him):
“When Allah mentioned the fathers and that their marriage to these women is forbidden forever, this indicates that the same prohibition applies in other relationships of mahram, such as the mother of the woman and those who are mahrams by rada'ah, etc.” (Ahkam al-Quran by al-Jassas, 3/317)
The same things are made haram by rada'ah as by ties of blood.
It also says in the Sunnah: “The same things are made haram by rada'ah as by ties of blood.” 
This means that the people who are mahram to a woman because of blood ties are also mahram because of rada'ah. It was reported in Sahih Muslim that ‘Aishah Umm al-Muminin (may Allah be pleased with her) said that Aflah the brother of Abu Qu’ays came and asked permission to see her. He was her uncle through rada'ah. This was after the hijaab had been revealed, so she refused to give him permission. When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came, she told him about what she had done and he told her to give him permission. (Sahih al-Bukhari bi Sharh al-'Asqalani, 9/150)
This hadith was also narrated by Imam Muslim, where the wording is: from ‘Urwah from ‘Aishah, who told him that her uncle by rada’ah, who was called Aflah, asked permission to see her and she did not let him. She told the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and he said to her, “Do not observe hijab in front of him, because the same relationships of mahram are created by rada'ah as by blood ties.” (Sahih Muslim bi Sharh al-Nawawi, 10/22)
A woman’s mahrams through rada'ah are the same as her mahrams through blood ties
In accordance with the Quran and Sunnah, the fuqaha have stated that a woman’s mahrams through rada'ah are the same as her mahrams through blood ties. It is permissible for her to display her adornments before her mahrams by rada'ah just as it is permissible for her to display her adornments before her mahrams by blood ties. It is permissible for her mahrams by rada'ah to see whatever of her body it is permissible for her mahrams by blood ties to see.
Mahrams by marriage
A woman’s mahrams by marriage are those whom it is forever forbidden to marry, such as the father’s wife, the son’s wife or the wife’s mother. (Sharh al-Muntaha, 3/7)
The mahram by marriage of the father’s wife is his son from another wife, for the wife of the son it is his father, and for the mother of the wife it is the husband. Allah says in Surah al-Nur (interpretation of the meaning):
“… and not to reveal their adornment except to their husbands, or their fathers, or their husband’s fathers, or their sons, or their husband’s sons…” [al-Noor 24:31]. 
Their husband’s fathers and their husband’s sons are mahrams of the woman by marriage. Allah mentioned them along with their (the women’s own) fathers and sons, and made them all the same in the sense that women may display their adornments in front of them. (Al-Mughni, 6/555)

      grace, and will give him a way out from his difficulties, and will make
      things easier for him. Allaah chooses for His slave something which is
      better that that which the slave would choose for himself. Fear Allaah,

5555,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/5555,Being    concerned with one’s appearance,"Some people are extremely concerned with their appearance and clothes, and spend a great deal of money on that. Is this in accordance with Islam or not?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Being overly concerned with ones appearance is the kind of extreme action that is condemned, because Islam is the religion of moderation that favours the middle path between extremes of any kind. Allaah said (interpretation of the meaning):
O Children of Adam! Take your adornment (by wearing your clean clothes) while praying [and going round (the Tawaaf of ) the Kabah] and eat and drink but waste not by extravagance, certainly He (Allaah) likes not Al-Musrifoon (those who waste by extravagance). [al-Araaf 7:31]
So Allaah has commanded us to take our adornment when coming to the mosque to pray, and He has permitted us to eat and drink, then He warned us against being extravagant and going to extremes, and has told us that He does not love those who waste by extravagance.
And Allaah said (interpretation of the meaning):
But spend not wastefully (your wealth) in the manner of a spendthrift. Verily, the spendthrifts are brothers of the Shayaateen (devils), and the Shaytaan (Devil-Satan) is ever ungrateful to his Lord [al-Israa 17:26-27]
The spendthrift is the brother of the Shaytaan and shares the same attitude, because he wastes money and spends it on things that are of no benefit. The measure of whether a thing is of no benefit is as the scholars said: if it is of no benefit in either religious or worldly terms.
The Muslims attitude should be as Allaah described it (interpretation of the meaning):
And those who, when they spend, are neither extravagant nor niggardly, but hold a medium (way) between those (extremes) [al-Furqaan 25:67]. They tread a middle path between miserliness and overspending. Ibn Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: Eat and drink and dress as you like, so long as you do not have two qualities: extravagance and showing off.
Many people are keen to make sure that their outward appearance is the best and cleanest and most proper, then they do not purify their hearts and souls of the diseases against which Allaah has warned us, such as hypocrisy, lying, envy, arrogance, showing off, pride, self-admiration, wrongdoing, ignorance and hatred towards the believers, or evil forbidden desires, etc. Allaah has told us that the garment of faith and taqwa (piety) is better than the outward garments. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
O Children of Adam! We have bestowed raiment upon you to cover yourselves (screen your private parts) and as an adornment; and the raiment of righteousness, that is better. Such are among the Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allaah, that they may remember (i.e. leave falsehood and follow truth). [al-Araaf 7:26]
The Prophet of Guidance (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us about the signs of a persons success:
Allaah does not look at the outward appearance or wealth of any one of you, but He looks at your hearts and deeds.
(Narrated by Muslim from the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah). The heart is the seat of taqwa and a man's essential qualities and the treasures of knowledge, and deeds are the balance in which people will be weighed before Allaah, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
Verily, the most honourable of you with Allaah is that (believer) who has At-Taqwaa [al-Hujuraat 49:13]
So it is strange indeed that a person would pay attention to how he appears to others, and wash and adorn himself lest there appears to be anything wrong with him, then he does not pay any attention to his heart which is what the Creator looks at, and he does not purify and adorn his heart.

      should take out the haraam amount, then the rest becomes permissible for

Etiquette of sex in Islam


When is ghusl compulsory for spouses?","Praise be to Allah.Yes, you are right: Islam teaches us all things and has brought all good teaching to mankind concerning their livelihood, religion, living and dying, because it is the religion of Allah, may He be glorified and exalted.
Sexual relations are among the important matters of life which Islam came to explain and to prescribe proper conduct and rulings which elevate it from the level of mere bestial pleasure and physical desire. 
Islam connects it to a righteous intention, supplications (adhkar) and proper conduct which lift it up to the level of worship for which the Muslim will be rewarded. The Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explains this. Imam Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) says in his book Zad al-Ma'ad:
Purpose of sex in Islam
Concerning sexual relations, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) brought the most perfect guidance, whereby health may be preserved and people may find pleasure and enjoyment, and it may fulfil the purpose for which it was created, because sex was created for three basic purposes:

The preservation and propagation of the human race, until they reach the number of souls that Allah has decreed should be created in this world.
Expulsion of the water (semen) which may cause harm to the body if it is retained.
Fulfilling physical desires and enjoying physical pleasure. This alone is the feature that will be present in Paradise, because there will be no producing offspring there, and no retention which needs to be relieved by ejaculation.

The best doctors suggest that sex is one of the means of maintaining good health. (al-Tibb al-Nabawi, p. 249).
And he (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
“Among its benefits is that it helps to lower the gaze, brings self-control, enables one to keep away from haram things, and achieves all of these things for the woman too. It brings benefit to a man with regard to this world and the Hereafter, and benefits the woman too. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to enjoy regular intimate relations with his wives, and he said, In your world, women and perfume have been made dear to me. (Narrated by Ahmad, 3/128; al-Nasai, 7/61; classed as sahih by al-Hakim)
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: O young men, whoever among you can afford it, let him get married, for it helps him to lower his gaze and protect his chastity. And whoever cannot do that, let him fast, for it will be a protection for him. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 9/92; Muslim, 1400) (Al-Tibb al-Nabawi, 251).
Etiquette of sex in Islam
Among the important matters which should be paid attention to when engaging in intimate relations:
1- Having the sincere intention of doing this thing only for the sake of Allah. One should intend to do this to protect oneself and one's wife from doing haram things, to increase the numbers of the Muslim ummah so as to raise its status, for there is honour and pride in large numbers. It should be known that one will be rewarded for this action, even if he finds immediate pleasure and enjoyment in it. It was reported from Abu Dharr that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: In the sexual intercourse of any one of you there is reward (meaning, when he has intercourse with his wife). They said, O Messenger of Allah, when any one of us fulfils his desire, will he have a reward for that? He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Do you not see that if he were to do it in a haram manner, he would be punished for that? So if he does it in a halal manner, he will be rewarded. (Narrated by Muslim, 720).
This is the great bounty of Allah towards this Ummah; praise be to Allah Who has made us among them.
2- Intercourse should be preceded by kind words, playfulness and kisses. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to play with his wives and kiss them.
3- When a man has intercourse with his wife, he should say: Bismillah, Allahumma jannibna al-shaytan wa jannib al-shaytan ma razqtana (In the name of Allah, O Allah Keep us away from the Shaytan and keep the Shaytan away from what You bestow on us (our children)). The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: If Allah decrees that they should have a child, the Shaytan will never harm him. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 9/187)
4- It is permissible for the husband to have intercourse with his wife in her vagina in whatever manner he wishes, from behind or from the front, on the condition that it is in her vagina, which is the place from which a child is born. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): Your wives are a tilth for you, so go to your tilth (have sexual relations with your wives in any manner as long as it is in the vagina and not in the anus), when or how you will [al-Baqarah 2:223]. Jabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Jews used to say that if a man had intercourse with his wife in her vagina from behind, the child would have a squint. Then this ayah was revealed: Your wives are a tilth for you, so go to your tilth (have sexual relations with your wives in any manner as long as it is in the vagina and not in the anus), when or how you will [al-Baqarah 2:223]. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: From the front or from the back, so long as it is in the vagina. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 8/154; Muslim, 4/156).
5- It is not permissible for the husband under any circumstances whatsoever to have intercourse with his wife in her back passage. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): Your wives are a tilth for you, so go to your tilth (have sexual relations with your wives in any manner as long as it is in the vagina and not in the anus), when or how you will [al-Baqarah 2:223]. It is known that the place of tilth is the vagina, which is the place from which one hopes for a child. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: He is cursed who has intercourse with women in their back passages. (Narrated by Ibn Udayy, 1/211; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Adab al-Zafaf, p. 105). This is because it [anal intercourse] goes against the fitrah [natural inclinations of man] and is an action which is revolting to those of a sound human nature; it also causes the woman to miss out on her share of pleasure; and the back passage is a place of filth and dirt and there are other reasons which confirm the fact that this deed is haram. For more information, please see Question #1103 .
6- If a man has intercourse with his wife and wants to come back to her a second time, he should do wudu, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: If any one of you has intercourse with his wife then wants to repeat it, let him do wudu between the two (actions), for it is more energizing for the second time. (Narrated by Muslim, 1/171). This is mustahabb (recommended), not wajib (obligatory); if he is able to do ghusl between the two actions, this is better, because of the hadith of Abu Raf’i who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went around his wives one day and did ghusl in this ones house and in this ones house. He (Abu Raf’i) said: I said to him, O Messenger of Allah, why do you not do one ghusl? He said, This is cleaner and better and purer. (Narrated by Abu Dawud and al-Nasai, 1/79)
When is ghusl compulsory for spouses?
7- One or both of the spouses have to do ghusl in the following situations:


When the two circumcised parts meet, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: When the circumcised part meets the circumcised part (according to another report: when the circumcised part touches the circumcised part), ghusl becomes wajib (obligatory). (Narrated by Ahmad and Muslim, no. 526). This ghusl is obligatory whether ejaculation takes place or not. The touching of the circumcised parts means that the glans or tip of the penis penetrates the vagina; it does not mean mere touching.
 


Emission of semen, even if the two circumcised parts do not touch, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, Water is for water [i.e., the water of ghusl is necessary when the water of semen is ejaculated]. (Narrated by Muslim, no. 1/269). Al-Baghawi said in Sharh al-Sunnah (2/9):
“Ghusl for janabah [impurity following sexual discharge] is wajib in either of two cases: when the tip of the penis enters the vagina, or when gushing water is emitted by either the man or the woman.
 
Please see this answer for more information on the details of ghusl as prescribed in shari’ah.


It is permissible for the husband and wife to do ghusl together in one place , even if he sees her and she sees him, because of the hadith of ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and I used to do ghusl together from one vessel between me and him; we would take turns dipping our hands in the vessel and he would take more than me until I would say, Leave some for me, leave some for me. She said, and they were both junub (in a state of janabah). Narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim.
8- It is permissible for a person who has to make ghusl to sleep and delay the ghusl until before the time of prayer, but it is definitely mustahabb for him to do wudu before sleeping, because of the hadith of ‘Umar, who said that he asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), Can any one of us sleep when he is junub? The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Yes, but let him do wudu if he wishes. (Narrated by Ibn Hibban, 232).
9- It is forbidden to have intercourse with a woman when she is menstruating (having her period), because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): They ask you concerning menstruation. Say: that is an adha (a harmful thing for a husband to have sexual intercourse with his wife while she is having her menses), therefore keep away from women during menses and go not unto them till they have purified (from menses and have taken a bath). And when they have purified themselves, then go in unto them as Allah has ordained for you (go in unto them in any manner as long as it is in their vagina). Truly, Allah loves those who turn unto Him in repentance and loves those who purify themselves (by taking a bath and cleaning and washing thoroughly their private parts, bodies, for their prayers, etc.). [al-Baqarah 2:222]. The person who has intercourse with his wife whilst she is menstruating has to give a dinar or half a dinar in charity, as it was reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) obliged a man to do so when he came and asked him about that. This was reported by the authors of al-Sunan and classed as sahih by al-Albani in Adab al-Zafaf, p. 122. But it is permissible for the husband to enjoy his menstruating wife without having intercourse, because of the hadith of ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would tell one of us, when she was menstruating, to wear a waist-wrapper, then her husband would lie with her. (Agreed upon).
10- It is permissible for the husband to withdraw (‘azl) if they do not want to have a child; by the same token it is permissible for him to use condoms if his wife gives him permission, because she has the right to pleasure and to children. The evidence for this is the hadith of Jabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said, We used to do ‘azl at the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) heard about that, and he did not forbid us. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 9/250; Muslim, 4/160).
But it is better not to do any of that, for several reasons, including the fact that it deprives the woman of pleasure or reduces the pleasure for her; and that it cancels out one of the purposes of marriage, which is to increase the number of offspring, as mentioned above.
11- It is forbidden for both spouses to spread the secrets of what happens between them in their private marital life; indeed, this is one of the most evil things. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Among the most evil of people before Allah on the Day of Resurrection will be a man who comes to his wife and has intercourse with her, then he spreads her secrets. (Narrated by Muslim, 4/157).
It was reported from Asma bint Yazid that she was with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and men and women were sitting with him, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, Would any man say what he did with his wife? Would any woman tell others what she did with her husband? The people kept quiet and did not answer. I [Asma] said: Yes, by Allah, O Messenger of Allah, they (women) do that, and they (men) do that. He said, Do not do that. It is like a male devil meeting a female devil in the road and having intercourse with her whilst the people are watching. (Narrated by Abu Dawud, no. 1/339; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Adab al-Zafaf, p. 143)
This is what we were able to mention about the etiquette of sexual relations. Praise be to Allah Who has guided us to this great religion with its sublime manners. Praise be to Allah Who has shown us the best of this world and the next. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.

What is istihadah?


Difference between istihadah and menstruation


How to know your period is over


Does brown blood mean your period is over?


Can you pray if you are spotting after a period?","Praise be to Allah.When does a period end?
When a woman menstruates, her period is over when the blood stops, regardless of whether the blood was a lot or a little. Many jurists stated that the shortest length of a woman’s period is a day and a night, and the longest is fifteen days.
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said there was no minimum or maximum for it ; when the bleeding is present with its distinct qualities, this is menstruation, whether it is a little or a lot. He said:
“Menstruation (al-hayd): Allah has attached numerous rulings to it in the Quran and Sunnah, but He did not state the shortest or longest length (of a menstrual period), or the length of the period of taharah between two menstrual periods, even though the need to know that exists.”
Then he said:
“Some of the scholars defined a maximum and minimum, but they differed concerning that, and some stated a maximum length without defining a minimum. The third view is most correct, which states that there is no minimum or maximum.” (Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 19/237)
What is istihadah?
There is a kind of bleeding which is called “al-istihadah ”, [irregular, non-menstrual vaginal bleeding] which is different from menstrual bleeding. It is governed by rulings which differ from those governing menstruation. 
Difference between istihadah and menstruation
This blood (istihadah) may be distinguished from the blood of menstruation by the following:

Colour: menstrual blood is black [dark red] whilst the blood of istihadah is red.
Consistency: menstrual blood is thick and heavy, whilst the blood of istihadah is thin.
Smell: menstrual blood has an offensive odour whilst the blood of istihadah does not, because it comes from an ordinary vein.

These are the characteristics of menstrual blood, so if this description fits the blood that is coming out, it is hayd (menstruation); ghusl is wajib (obligatory) and this blood is najis (impure), but ghusl is not required in the case of istihadah.
When a woman has her period, she is not allowed to pray, but when the bleeding is istihadah, that is not the case. But she has to be careful and has to do wudu for each prayer if the flow of blood continues to the next prayer. If blood comes out whilst she is praying, it does not matter.
How to know your period is over
A woman can know that her period has ended by two things:

The white discharge which comes from the womb to show that the period is over.


Complete dryness, if a woman does not have this white discharge. In this case she can find out if her period has ended by inserting a piece of white cotton or something similar into the place where the blood comes from; if it comes out clean, then her period is over and she has to do ghusl and pray. If the cloth comes out red, yellow or brown, she should not pray.

The women used to send small containers in which were these cloths with traces of yellow on them to ‘Aishah, and she would say, “Do not hasten until you see the white discharge.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari mu’allaqan. Kitab al-Hayd, Bab iqbal al-mahid wa idbarihi. Also by Malik, 130).
Does brown blood mean your period is over?
But if there is a yellow or brownish discharge when a woman does not have her period, this does not mean anything and she should not stop praying or do ghusl because of it, because it does not necessitate ghusl or cause janabah (impurity).
Umm ‘Atiyyah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “We did not bother about any yellow or brownish discharge after a woman’s period was over .” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 307. It was also narrated by al-Bukhari, 320, but he did not mention “after a woman’s period was over.”)
“We did not bother about” means we did not think it was menstruation, but it is a najis (impure) discharge which means that a woman has to wash it away and do wudu. But if the white discharge is immediately followed by a period, then it is part of the period.
Can you pray if you are spotting after a period?
If a woman believes that her period has ended, then she starts bleeding again, if the blood has the characteristics of menstrual blood as described above, then this is menstrual bleeding , otherwise it is istihadah.
If it is the former, she should not pray. If it is the latter, she should be careful and do wudu for each prayer, then pray.
Concerning the brownish discharge , if she sees this after her period has ended, then the ruling is that it is tahir (pure), but it requires her to do wudu only. But if she sees it during the time of her period, then it comes under the rulings of menstruation.
And Allah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
