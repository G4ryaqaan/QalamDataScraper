Naturally his work includes paperwork for employees’ salaries and other tasks, and that includes giving employees letters with details of their salaries when the employee requests that. But some of them use this letter to take out loans from the bank. Is there any sin on the employee who provides this certification, knowing that this is part of the nature of his work?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong 
    with writing a letter stating salary details for employees who request that, 
    unless it is to be submitted to a riba-based bank with the aim of taking out 
    a loan. In that case it is not permissible to write it, because that is 
    helping them to disobey Allaah, and to commit a major sin. 
The Standing Committee 
    (15/58) was asked about an employee in the copy department of a university 
    who wrote letters for the university employees so that they could take 
    riba-based loans from one of the banks – is that permissible? 
They replied: 
It is not permissible to 
    make these copies or write these letters if the one who is doing that knows 
    that the letter will help the person to engage in riba-based transactions, 
    because of the general meaning of the hadeeth according to which the 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed 
    the one who consumes riba, the one who pays it, the one who writes it down 
    and the two who witness it, and he said: they are all the same. Narrated by 
    Muslim in his Saheeh. And because of the general meaning of the verse 
    in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Help you one another 
    in Al‑Birr and At‑Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help 
    one another in sin and transgression”

59866,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/59866,Zakah on jewellery that has been prepared for use,"My father-in-Law gave 560grams Gold ornaments at the time of Marriage in 1994. Also we got some gold jewels as a gift from relatives at the time of my wife delivery. I bought some Jewels for my wife in the mean time(1994-2004). Now my wife told me that we have to give 240 Grams gold as a Zakat.
My  is: I should pay Zakat for all the above 3 categories ?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Jewellery that has been prepared to be worn and used as an adornment is something concerning which the fuqaha’ differed as to whether it is obligatory to pay zakah on it. The Hanafis are of the view that it is obligatory to pay zakah on it, but the majority of Maalikis, Shaafa’is and Hanbalis are of the view that it is not obligatory to pay zakah on it. 
The more correct view is that of the Hanafis, because of the great deal of evidence, including the following: 
1 – The general meaning of the evidence which indicates that it is obligatory to pay zakah on gold and silver, without differentiating between jewellery that is worn and other kinds. 
2 – It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), the wife of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) entered upon me and I was wearing rings of silver on my hand. He said: “What is this, O ‘Aa’ishah?” I said: “I made them to adorn myself for you, O Messenger of Allah.” He said: “Have you given zakah on them?” I said: “No.” He said: “The punishment for them in Hell is enough for you.”
Narrated by Abu Dawood, 155; classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
It was narrated from ‘Amr ibn Shu’ayb, from his father, from his grandfather, that a woman came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and she had a daughter of hers with her. On her daughter’s hand were two thick bracelets of gold. He said to her: “Have you given the zakah on these?” She said: “No.” He said, “Would you like Allah to make you two bracelets of fire on the Day of Resurrection because of these?” So she took them off and gave them to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: “They are for Allah and His Messenger.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 1563; al-Nasaa’i, 2479; classed as hasan by al-Albani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
Secondly: 
You have to pay zakah when you come to know that it is obligatory. As for the years that have passed when you did not know that zakah was obligatory on jewellery that has been prepared for use, you do not have to pay zakah on it. 
Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about a woman who has jewellery for adornment that stayed with her for years, then she came to know that it was obligatory for her to pay zakah on it – did she have to pay zakah for the past years? He replied: You have to pay zakah from the time when you came to know that it is obligatory to pay zakah on jewellery. As for the past when you did not know about that, it is not obligatory for you to pay zakah, because the rulings of sharee’ah are only binding after one comes to know of them.""(Fatawa Islamiyyah, 2/84). 
With regard to a similar matter, he said (2/85): 
She has to pay zakah on her jewellery in the future each year if it reaches the nisaab (minimum threshold)… as for the years that have passed, before she came to know that zakah must be paid on jewellery, she does not have to do anything about them, because she was unaware of that and because there is some element of confusion concerning this issue, since some of the scholars do not think that it is obligatory to pay zakah on jewellery that is worn or is prepared to be worn. But the more correct view is that it is obligatory to pay zakah on it, if it reaches the nisaab and one full (Hijri) year has passed, because of the evidence of the Quran and Sunnah to that effect. 
Thirdly: 
zakah on jewellery that is prepared to be used applies to jewellery of gold and silver. Based on this, there is no zakah on gems that you have bought, if they are not gold or silver. 
See also question no.  40210. 
Fourthly: 
The zakah must be paid by the owner of the jewellery, not by the husband. 
Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “zakah must be paid by the owner of the jewellery. If it is paid by her husband or someone else on her behalf and with her permission, there is nothing wrong with that. The zakah need not be paid from the jewellery itself, rather it is sufficient ti give the equivalent value each time one year passes, according to the value of gold and silver in the market when the year has passed.""(Fatawa Islamiyyah, 2/85)
But if the gift has been given to you both, and you have not given your share of it to your wife, then you have to pay the zakah on your share, if it meets the nisaab, which is 85 grams. 
The amount that must be paid is one-quarter of one-tenth or 2.5%, so for one hundred grams it is two and a half grams.

59867,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/59867,He is going to rent a house and what he has paid will be returned to him at the end of the lease,"I am a resident of Chennai,India.I would like to take up a residence on lease by paying a lumpsum for a period of three years and no rent is payable during this period.After the expiry of the leased period the premises will be handed over to the owner and the same lumpsum will be returned to me.The agreement can also be extended by mutual consent.Maintenence charges have to be paid for the apartment monthly.This system is widely practised here. Some islamic scholars feel that this is not permitted in islam and a certain amount is to be compulsurily paid as rent.If this condition is to be fulfilled can I pay a small nominal amount as rent. Please give the islamic ruling in this matter in the light of sunnah and Quran.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
It is not permissible to do the deal in this manner. This is a form of loaning with interest, which is haraam. 
The reason for that is that a loan means giving money or property to someone to benefit from it and then give it back. 
The money that is given to the landlord will be returned after the agreed lease period ends, so this money is a loan, and the lender benefits from this loan by making use of the house until his money is returned to him. So this deal is in fact a loan which brings a benefit, and the scholars are agreed that every loan which brings a benefit to the lender is haraam, because it is a type of riba. 
Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (6/436): 
Every loan in which it is stipulated that something extra be given (when paying back) is haraam, with no dispute. Ibn al-Mundhir said: They are unanimously agreed that if the lender stipulates that the borrower should give something extra or give him a gift, and he gives the loan on that basis, then taking the extra amount is riba. It was narrated from Ubayy ibn Ka’b, Ibn ‘Abbaas and Ibn Mas’ood that they forbade loans that bring benefits. End quote. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 4/64: 
An example of benefits as a condition of a loan is when a man comes to another man and says: “I want you to lend me one hundred thousand,” and he says, “But I will live in your house for a month.” Here the loan brings a benefit to the lender so it is haraam and is not permissible. 
The basic principle concerning loans is that they are an act of kindness towards the borrower, but if conditions are introduced it becomes a kind of business deal, and if it is a kind of business deal then it involves riba al-fadl and riba al-nasee’ah. So for example if someone borrows one hundred thousand from me and I stipulate that I will live in his house for a month, then it is as if I sold him one hundred thousand in return for something extra, which is my living in the house for a month. This is riba nasee’ah because it is a delay in handing over what has been borrowed, and it is riba al-fadl because it involves giving something extra. 
Hence the scholars said that every loan that brings a benefit is riba. End quote. 
It says in al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (3/266): 
The conditions of a loan being valid: 
The first condition: the lender should not benefit. If the lender benefits form giving the loan either by stipulating conditions in the contract or otherwise, then if it is by stipulating conditions then it is haraam without any scholarly dispute on that point… end quote. 
Secondly: 
Attention should be paid to what a contract really involves in spite of what it is called. In fact this contract – as stated above – is a loan that brings benefits, and this is a kind of riba. The fact that people call it renting does not alter the fact at all, and does not change the ruling thereon. The Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us that some people among his ummah would drink khamr (alcohol) and call it by another name. 
So beware of making halaal things that are haraam. Paying a small amount as rent does not make this haraam action permissible, because the larger amount that is paid is still a loan that brings a benefit. 
The owner of the money has not paid the larger amount of money (the loan) which will come back to him for any purpose other than to make use of the house, and the owner of the house has not given the house to the other person to use except in return for the loan. 
Nothing is hidden from Allaah, and He has punished the one who makes haraam things halaal by means of trickery with a swift punishment, as happened in the story of the Sabbath-breakers (see al-Nisa’ 4:47 and al-A’raaf 7:163).

59869,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/59869,Is it sunnah to shave the hair of a newborn girl?,"Regarding answer to ?14248 how did the sheik come to the verdict it is not sunnah to shave girls hair,dont girls have the harm in thier hair as well,is there difference of opinion.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Al-Tirmidhi (1522) narrated that Samurah said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The boy is in pledge for his ‘aqeeqah which should be slaughtered on his behalf on the seventh day, and he should be named and his head shaved.” This hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, and it indicates that it is mustahabb to shave the hair of the newborn. 
The fuqaha’ differed with regard to shaving the head of a female newborn. The Maalikis and Shaafa’is are of the view that it should be shaved as the male’s head is shaved. The Hanbalis are of the view that it should not be shaved.  
The Shaafa’is quoted as evidence for shaving the head of a female the mursal report narrated by Maalik, al-Bayhaqi and others from Muhammad ibn ‘Ali ibn al-Husayn who said: Faatimah the daughter of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) weighed the hair of Hasan, Husayn, Zaynab and Umm Kalthoom, and gave the equivalent weight in silver in charity. Al-Bayhaqi also narrated it in a marfoo’ report from ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told Faatimah to give charity equal to the weight in silver of the hair of al-Husayn. Al-Nawawi said: There is some weakness in its isnaad. 
The argument of the Hanbalis is based on the fact that in principle women are not allowed to shave their heads, and there is no report concerning shaving the newborn except in the case of a boy. 
Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni (1/104): It is proven in the reports that it is makrooh for a woman to shave her head unnecessarily. Abu Moosa said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) disavowed himself of women who raise their voices and shave their heads (at times of loss). Agreed upon.  
Al-Khallaal narrated with his isnaad from Qataadah that ‘Ikrimah said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade women to shave their heads, and al-Hasan said: It is mutilation – i.e., changing the creation of Allaah. 
Because there is no saheeh hadeeth which speaks of shaving the head of a newborn female, the principle remains, which is that it is forbidden to shave the head. 
See: Sharh al-Khurashi ‘ala Mukhtasar Khaleel (3/48); al-Majmoo’ (8/406); Kishshaaf al-Qinaa’ (3/29). 
With regard to the command to remove the harm that is mentioned in the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “With the boy there is his ‘aqeeqah so shed blood on his behalf and remove the harm from him” (narrated by al-Bukhaari (5471), the phrase “remove the harm” may be interpreted in different ways. It was said that what is meant is shaving the head, or removing any dirt that is on it, such as blood etc. So it may be understood that it means it is mustahabb to wash it. 
Al-Haafiz said in al-Fath (9/593): In the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas that is narrated by al-Tabaraani it says: “Remove the harm from him and shave his head.” So he added the idea of shaving the head after saying remove the harm. Therefore we should interpret the word adha (harm) as referring to something more general in meaning than shaving the head. This is supported by the fact in that some versions of the hadeeth of ‘Amr ibn Shu’ayb it says:  “and wipe the dirt from him”. Narrated by Abu’l-Shaykh. End quote. 
Whatever the case, the hadeeth refers to boys only (ghulaam) and this supports the view of the Hanbalis.

NOTE: There is not a single marketor a gas station here that doesnot sell alcohol. i have searched and muslim businesses dont sell everything you need.please inform the muslims here in the light of quran and sunnah.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
The Muslim should avoid places in which Allah is disobeyed as much as possible. Hence it is better for you to support Islamic stores which do not sell things that Allah has forbidden, and advise their owners to supply things that you need, because that will benefit all concerned, you and the store owners. 
Secondly: 
As for buying what you need from the stores asked about, there is nothing wrong with that in sha Allah, especially when there is a need for that and these items are not available in other stores that do not sell haraam things. 
But you should go to those stores only as much as is necessary and the more you can avoid entering them, the better. 
Thirdly: 
It should be noted that obliging non-Muslims not to show alcohol or their religious symbols openly only applies if they enter a Muslim land or submit to the rule of Islam. 
But if they are in their own country and have not submitted to the rule of Islam, then dealings with them should be in accordance with their customs and beliefs, and they believe that alcohol is permissible in their religion. 
Abu ‘Ubayd narrated that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allah be pleased with him) heard that some of his governors were taking the jizyah in the form of alcohol and pork, then they sold them to ahl al-dhimmah ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: Do not do that; rather let them sell it, then take (the jizyah) from its price. 
Abu ‘Ubayd said: he meant that the Muslims were taking alcohol and pork from the ahl al-dhimmah then appointing Muslims to sell them, and this is what ‘Umar forbade, but he granted a concession allowing them to take [the jizyah] from their price if dhimmis were appointed to sell them, because alcohol and pork are part of the wealth and property of ahl al-dhimmah, but they cannot be wealth for the Muslims. End quote from Ahkaam Ahl al-Dhimmah by Ibn al-Qayyim (1/184). 
This indicates that sales of alcohol among Christians are valid, because they believe it is permissible in their religion, but it is not permissible for a Muslim to sell it, even if he is selling it to a Christian.",Islam Q&A

The conversation should not be allowed to wander too far from the topic being discussed; or it should be for the purposes of calling others to Islam. ""]]] So my question regarding this is: In Sharee'ah, what can be considered a permissable topic to discuss in the first place? For example, we know that Islaam is a permissable topic, but what other things can we discuss, if anything?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.This has been discussed in the answer to question no. 1497 where it says:  
Speaking with a woman to whom one is not related (i.e., not mahram) should only be for a specific need, such as asking a question, buying or selling, asking about the head of the household, and so on. Such conversations should be brief, with nothing doubtful in either what is said or how it is said. 
The idea of limiting speech with women to the five instances mentioned in the question – which are: to ask how her family is, for medical purposes, for financial purposes (e.g. in a shop), to find out about her personality for marriage suitability and to give her dawah (Islamic knowledge) – needs to be approached with caution, because they could be taken as examples instead of limits. One must also adhere to the conditions set out by the Sharee’ah even in instances where such conversations are necessary, such as in da’wah, giving fatwas, buying or selling, etc. And Allah knows best.  
In the answer to question no. 1121 it says:
Women are not prevented from talking to non-mahram men when it is necessary to do so, such as dealing directly with them when buying things or conducting any other financial transaction, because in such cases it is necessary for both parties to speak. A woman may also ask a scholar about some legal Islamic matter, or a man may ask a woman such questions, as is proven in various texts of the Quran and Sunnah. Within the guidelines described above, there is nothing wrong with a woman speaking to a non-mahram man. It is also permissible for men to greet women with salam and vice versa, according to the most correct opinion, but this greeting must be free of anything that may provoke desire in the person in whose heart is a disease, so as to be safe from fitnah and pay attention to the regulations outlined above.
If there is fear of fitnah being provoked by this greeting, then the woman should refrain from either initiating or returning the greeting, because warding off fitnah by neglecting the greeting is warding off mischief, and warding off mischief takes precedence over doing something useful. (See al-Mufassal fi Ahkaam al-Mar’ah by ‘Abd al-Kareem Zaydaan, vol. 3/276). And Allah knows best.
Thus it is known that we do not mean general talk for no need, or a great deal of private talk. Rather it should be just as much as is needed in order to reply.

    reason why a well-wisher should not donate Hajj expenses to someone, and it 
    is not a condition of obligatory or naafil Hajj being valid that it should

If this 
    donation is given to a relative, then the reward is greater, and he will 
    have a reward like that of Hajj, in sha Allaah. What your father is going to

59896,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/59896,What will happen to a woman in Paradise if her husband is one of the people of the Fire?,"In the Holy Qur’aan and in many ahaadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) it describes what the Muslim will find when he enters Paradise by Allah’s Leave of reward and delights. In particular mention is made of al-hoor al-‘iyn and it says that Allah will reunite him with his wife if she was one of the righteous believing women.
 My question is: What awaits the righteous believing woman who enters Paradise if her husband was not righteous and is one of the people of Hell, Allah forbid?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.We ask Allah to make us and you among the people of Paradise, with all our families and loved ones. If a woman’s husband enters Paradise along with her, then he will be her husband there too, but if he is one of the people of Hell, or if the woman did not get married in this world, then she will get married to a man among the people of Paradise. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: If a woman is one of the people of Paradise and she did not get married in this world, or she got married but her husband does not enter Paradise, who will she be with? 
He answered: 
The answer is based on the general meaning of the verses in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Therein you shall have (all) that your inner‑selves desire, and therein you shall have (all) for which you ask” [Fussilat 41:31] 
“(there will be) therein all that inner‑selves could desire, and all that eyes could delight in and you will abide therein forever” [al-Zukhruf 43:71]
So if a woman is one of the people of Paradise and she did not get married, or if her husband is not one of the people of Paradise, when she enters Paradise there will be men who did not get married, and those men will have wives from among the hur al-‘iyn and wives from among the people of this world if they wish. 
Similarly with regard to the woman who did not have a husband, or who had a husband in this world but he did not enter Paradise with her, if she wants to get married then she will inevitably have what she desires, because of the general meaning of these verses.

59897,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/59897,Should he travel to kaafir countries or work in a tourist resort?,"I am a student in business college, in the fourth year. I would like to finish my studies as quickly as possible so that I can achieve two goals: 

1-     To respond to urgent family needs

2-     To start my own life plans 

I have two options ahead of me: 

1-     To work, starting from next summer (in an area far removed from my speciality), in a seaside resort, for a high salary.

2-     To travel to any western country where I intend to complete my studies, and at the same time I will do any work to pay for the cost of my studies as well, until I reach my goal. 

I hope that you can advise me as to which I should choose. The problem with both options is that I am a single young man and I fear fitnah for myself, but I am wondering how committed Muslim youth can live in western societies.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
We 
    appreciate your keenness to find halaal work and to seek advice, and your 
    eagerness to meet your family’s needs. We ask Allaah to help you to do that 
    which is best for you and will bring you happiness in this world and in the 
    Hereafter.
Secondly: 
As you are 
    studying in the business college, you have to look for work that is 
    permissible, because opportunities for halaal work in such fields are few. 
    Most companies and organizations nowadays deal in riba (usury) and insurance 
    and other haraam transactions, which makes working as an accountant in them 
    a kind of helping them in sin and transgression. 
Thirdly: 
Travelling 
    to western countries poses many dangers to man’s religious commitment and 
    morals. It is rare for a person to travel there and preserve his religious 
    commitment and not lose it, because of the false ideas and views that 
    prevail in those countries, and the deviant behaviour and morals that are so 
    obvious to everyone that some of their own wise men are warning against the 
    consequences of them. 
Hence one of 
    the beauties of our wise sharee’ah is that it forbids the Muslim to settle 
    in the kaafir lands. This has been explained in the answer to several 
    questions, such as 10338 and
    14235. 
If a person 
    is compelled or needs to travel to these countries then he must fulfil 
    certain conditions in order for his travel to be permissible, the most 
    important of which is that he should have sufficient knowledge to protect 
    himself against specious arguments and he should have sufficient religious 
    commitment and taqwa (piety, fear of Allaah) to protect himself against 
    desires. He should take his wife with him if he cannot protect himself 
    against desires in any other way.  
You mention 
    that you are a single man, and you fear temptation for yourself. Therefore 
    you should not go ahead and risk your religious commitment. 
Fourthly: 
With regard 
    to working in a seaside tourist area in an area far removed from your 
    specialty, undoubtedly that is better than going to a kaafir land, but you 
    must pay attention to the following: 

    1-The nature of the work must be 
    permissible.

59899,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/59899,Is Alcohol in Food and Cosmetics Haram?,"I am a university student in Vienna. During my studies in the faculty of pharmacy, I discovered that most food products have a very small amount of alcohol added to them. It is added when mixing two ingredients, or as a preservative or thickener. The substances in question are: maltitol, xylitol, sorbitol, glycerol, pectin, agar agar, triacetin and vanillin. Another question: what is the ruling on creams, perfumes or cosmetic products in general?","If the effect of alcohol in medicine and food is clear, it is haram to add it and it is haram to use these foods and medicines, whether they are eaten or drunk. If it has no effect when added to these foods and medicines, it is permissible to use them and eat or drink them.","Is alcohol haram?


Is alcohol impure?


Is alcohol in food and cosmetics haram?


Ruling on cosmetic products","Praise be to Allah.Is alcohol haram?
Alcohol is an intoxicating substance; every intoxicant is khamr and khamr is haram . There are two issues having to do with alcohol:
The first issue is: is it impure (najis) or not? The second issue is: does it have an effect when it is added to other ingredients in medicines and foods?
Is alcohol impure?
With regard to the first issue, the majority of scholars are of the view that alcohol is impure (najis) in a real, physical sense, but the correct view is that that is not the case, and that its impurity is metaphorical.
Is alcohol in food and cosmetics haram?
With regard to the second issue, if alcohol is added to other ingredients in medicine and food, either it will have a clear effect, or it will not. If its effect is clear, it is haram to add it and it is haram to use these foods and medicines, whether they are eaten or drunk.
If it has no effect when added to these foods and medicines , it is permissible to use them and eat or drink them. There is a difference between consuming undiluted alcohol and consuming it after it has been added to something else. If a person consumes it on its own, even in a small amount, it is not permissible, and if it is added to something else, the rulings discussed above are to be applied.
There follows a fatwa of Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-‘Uthaymin discussing this matter in detail.
He (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Alcohol is an intoxicating substance, as is well known, so it is khamr, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Every intoxicant is haram.” According to another report: “Every intoxicant is khamr.” Based on that, if this alcohol is mixed with something else and it is not absorbed into it, then that thing becomes haram, because the trace of the alcohol is still apparent. But if this alcohol is absorbed into what it is mixed with, and no trace of it can be seen, then that thing does not become haram, because the scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) are unanimously agreed that if some impurity is mixed with water, but it does not change it, then the water remains pure. The ratio between the alcohol and what it is mixed with may be great or small, in the sense that the alcohol may be strong, in which case a small amount will have an impact on what it is mixed with. Or it may be weak, in which case a large amount of it will have no impact. Everything depends on whether it has an impact or not.
Then there are two further issues to discuss:

Is khamr impure in a real, physical sense, meaning that one should not touch it and it must be washed off if it gets onto the clothes or body or vessels, or not? 

The majority of scholars are of the view that khamr is impure in a real sense, and it must be washed off if it gets onto the body, clothes, vessels, furnishings or anything else, just as urine and feces must be washed off. They quoted as evidence for that the verse in which Allah, may he be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):
{O you who have believed, indeed, intoxicants, gambling, [sacrificing on] stone altars [to other than Allah], and divining arrows are but an abomination] from the work of Satan} [Al-Maidah 5:90]
Abomination is impurity, based on the verse in which Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):
{Say, “I do not find within that which was revealed to me [anything] forbidden to one who would eat it unless it be a dead animal or blood spilled out or the flesh of swine - for indeed, it is an abomination} [Al-An‘am 6:145]
In other words, it is impure.
They also quoted as evidence the hadith of Abu Tha‘labah al-Khushani, when he asked the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) about eating from the vessels of the disbelievers. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not eat from them, unless you cannot find anything else, in which case wash them and eat from them.” Regarding the reason for the prohibition on eating from such vessels, it was narrated that they used to put alcohol, pork and the like in them.
The second view regarding this matter is that alcohol is not impure in a real, physical sense. They quoted as evidence for this view the fact that the basic principle is that things are pure, and if something is prohibited, that does not necessarily mean that it is impure. Poison is undoubtedly haram, yet despite that it is not impure. They said: The Islamic principle is that everything that is impure is haram, but not everything that is haram is impure.
Based on that, alcohol remains haram but it is not impure unless there is evidence to indicate that it is impure. They also quoted as evidence the fact that when alcohol was prohibited, the Muslims poured it out in the marketplaces, and they did not wash the vessels afterwards. The fact that they poured it out in the marketplaces indicates that it is not impure, because it is not permissible for anyone to pour out something impure in the marketplaces of the Muslims, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Avoid the two things that provoke curses.” They said: O Messenger of Allah, what are the two things that provoke curses? He said: “The one who relieves himself in the street where people walk or in the place where they seek shade.” Furthermore, they did not wash the vessels to cleanse them [after pouring away the alcohol]; if it was impure, it would be obligatory to wash the vessels after pouring it away. In support of this view, they also quoted the proven report in Sahih Muslim which says that a man gave a gift to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) of a skin full of wine. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told him that it had been forbidden, and one of the Companions whispered to the one who had brought the wine – meaning that he said something to him privately. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “What did you whisper to him?” He said: I said: Sell it. But the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) told him not to sell it, and said: “When Allah forbids a thing, He also forbids its price.” Then the man opened the mouth of the wineskin and poured away the wine in the presence of the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not instruct him to wash the skin [container]. If alcohol was impure, the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) would have told him that the skin [container] was impure and he would have instructed him to wash it.
As for what was quoted as evidence by those who say that alcohol is impure in a real sense, namely the verse (interpretation of the meaning):
{O you who have believed, indeed, intoxicants, gambling, [sacrificing on] stone altars [to other than Allah], and divining arrows are but an abomination] from the work of Satan} [Al-Maidah 5:90],
Allah has qualified this abomination by pointing out that it is the action that is objectionable: {an abomination from the work of Satan}; it is not an abomination or impure in a physical sense, based on the fact that gambling, sacrificing on stone altars and using divining arrows are not impure in a physical sense, and the words that describe them as impure and mention the impurity of alcohol all appear in one verse, and describe them as such for one reason: {indeed, intoxicants, gambling, [sacrificing on] stone altars [to other than Allah], and divining arrows are but an abomination from the work of Satan} [Al-Maidah 5:90]. As that is the case, they cannot be interpreted or understood in two different ways except on the basis of specific evidence to that effect.
As for the hadith of Abu Tha‘labah al-Khushani, the instruction to wash the vessels [of the disbelievers] was not because of impurity, because there is a possibility that the instruction to wash them was for the purpose of encouraging them to keep away completely from using the vessels of the disbelievers, which would lead to becoming closely associated with them, and it was not because of impurity. It is well known that impurity cannot be confirmed on the basis of possibility.
Whatever the case, this is the first matter that we have to discuss in order to answer this question about alcohol. Once it is established that khamr is not impure in a real sense, then we may ascertain that alcohol is not impure in a real, physical sense, so it remains pure as it was originally.

With regard to the second matter, if it becomes certain that these perfumes contain alcohol that has an impact because there is a large amount of it, then is it permissible to use them without drinking them? 

The answer to that is that the words of Allah, {so avoid it} [al-Maidah 5:90] are general in meaning and apply to all ways of using it. In other words, we should avoid eating it, drinking it, applying it as perfume, and other uses. This is undoubtedly more prudent. But avoiding it is not strictly enjoined except in the case of drinking, because Allah, may He be exalted, gave the reason for the command to avoid it when He said (interpretation of the meaning):
{Satan only wants to cause between you animosity and hatred through intoxicants and gambling and to avert you from the remembrance of Allah and from prayer. So will you not desist?} [Al-Maidah 5:91]
These bad consequences do not appear except in the case of drinking. Based on that, prudence dictates avoiding these perfumes, but we cannot state definitively that they are haram to use.""(Fatawa Nur ‘ala ad-Darb)
