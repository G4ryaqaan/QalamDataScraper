13802,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13802,The husband’s responsibility to educate his wife,"If a muslim man has taken a muslim wife, and not fulfilled his obligations set forth by allah and the quran.
As a result the muslim women leaves the deen, and now doesn't cover and maybe not even practicing islam anymore.
My question is, what are the consciquences of their actions?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Ward off yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones, over which are (appointed) angels stern (and) severe, who disobey not, (from executing) the Commands they receive from Allaah, but do that which they are commanded”[al-Tahreem 66:6]
It was narrated from Ibn ‘Umar that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Each of you is a shepherd and each of you is responsible for his flock. The ameer (ruler) who governs the people is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock. A man is the shepherd of the members of his household and is responsible for them. A woman is the shepherd of her husband’s house and children and is responsible for them. A slave is the shepherd of his master’s wealth and is responsible for it. Each of you is a shepherd and each of you is responsible for his flock.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 7138; Muslim, 1829) 
From these two texts it is quite clear that a man is responsible for his family with regard to teaching them and making sure that they follow Islam, and he should use forceful measures when necessary and when that is the only way to serve this purpose. Allaah will call every shepherd to account for whatever was under his care, so whoever neglects his wife and children in this regard is undoubtedly taking a great risk. Indeed, there is a stern warning issued to such people which makes the flesh crawl. In Saheeh al-Bukhaari (7151) and Saheeh Muslim (142), in Kitaab al-Imaarah, it is narrated that Ma’fil ibn Yasaar al-Muzni (may Allaah be pleased with him) said, “I heard the Messenger of Allaah () peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “There is no slave to whom Allaah has entrusted the care of people, and he dies neglecting his flock, but Allaah will forbid Paradise to him.” 
So a man’s responsibility towards his wife is great indeed and he must fear Allaah and do the best he can to fulfil it, whilst always making du’aa’ for himself and his family, that they may be guided and granted strength. 
As far as the wife is concerned, she is also accountable and is responsible for her own actions, because the obligations of sharee’ah apply to both men and women, except in cases where Islam differentiates between them in some rulings, such as when it says that it is better for a woman to pray in her own home than in the mosque, in order to protect her from mixing with men. Hence it is narrated in Sunan al-Tirmidhi (113) and elsewhere that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Women are the twin halves of men”. This was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 1/35. 
In the hadeeth quoted above it states that the woman is also a shepherd and is responsible for her flock. And Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Every person is a pledge for that which he has earned”
[al-Toor 52:21] 
“And everyone of them will come to Him alone on the Day of Resurrection (without any helper, or protector or defender)”
[Maryam 19:95]
So responsibility is an individual matter, and each person will be brought to account on his own. So when a young man grows up, if he goes astray because of his parents’ bad upbringing and the message of Islam reached him, then he will have no excuse, because Allaah gave him the power of reason and therefore he is accountable, even though his father will be accountable for falling short in supervising his child’s Islamic upbringing, and he (the father) is even more accountable with regard to his wife.  So the wife must fear her Lord and give thanks to Allaah for His blessings for having given her the blessing of Islam, unlike the kuffaar. She should do her duty towards Allaah by doing that which is obligatory and refraining from forbidden things. She should know that death may come suddenly and that after death there will be the reckoning and questioning, and after that there will be either Paradise and eternal delight that will never end, or Hell with fire that could melt firmly rooted mountains and huge rocks, so what about our weak bodies? We ask Allaah to save us from it. 
With regard to you, my dear brother, you have to repent sincerely. No matter how great one’s sin, if a person repents and meets all the conditions of repentance, Allaah will accept his repentance. Then start to teach and guide your wife, using a gradual approach and kindness, accompanied by wisdom, asking Allaah to help you and give you strength.

13803,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13803,Her husband beats her severely,"I am a 22 year old Muslim born female in in America

I have been married to my husband 

I married him because I thought that he was a good Muslim brother who cared about spreading ISlam and helping to raise the Kalimah of Allah -swt- by helping Muslims

I wanted to break off the marriage when we were still engaged about 4 years ago because he was saying mean things to me, hurting my feelings, and emotionally abusive.  

But he promised that after we got married he would be nice to me and that his harshness was the result of him having a bad job.
Since Muslims are supposed to keep their promises, I believed and trusted him, and agreed to marry him.

Since being married, he has gotten worse and has been physically abusive, even punching me and choking me.

My parents finally found out about 8 months ago.  I left him to my parents house at that time for a few weeks.  They convinced me that i should give him another chance because any other man i would marry would probably be even worse.  They say that all of the other divorced women end up with worse husbands and situations.

He came back apologizing and promising to change his ways of saying hurtful things, being picky, and to stop the abuse.  The agreemant was that I would go back to him to see if he really has changed.

After going back to him, he only changed for a short while.

He has been verbally and emotionally abusive.  He has been physically abusive to a small degree.  He has pushed me lightly and smacked me lightly.  
Since this is how his abuse started when we first got married from light to harder and harder, I decided a couple of months later that he has not changed and told my parents that.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    We ask Allaah to help you cope with the calamities that have 
    befallen you, and to grant you the reward of those who are patient, for He 
    is Most Generous, Most Kind. 

    The husband should realize that he is a shepherd and is 
    responsible for his flock. Allaah has enjoined upon him to treat them in a 
    good and proper manner and to treat his family kindly. Our Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The best of you is the 
    one who is best towards his wife, and I am the best of you towards my 
    wives.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3895; Ibn Maajah, 1977; classed as saheeh 
    by Shaykh al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami, 3314). Part of that good and 
    kind treatment means not beating one’s wife in a severe manner and not 
    insukting or cursing her. He should realize that this is a violation of the 
    trust with which Allaah has entrusted him.  

    We have heard that many people have a hard time finding a job 
    by which they may earn their livelihood, and that it may take a long time to 
    find a suitable job. We have heard that many of these people oppress their 
    wives and beat them, as if they are the cause of what is happening to them. 
    It is as if they use this situation to justify their abhorrent actions. 
    These men have to fear Allaah and to realize that they are the ones who are 
    most in need of obeying Allaah and keeping away from haraam things; they 
    should not commit sins then justify that for themselves. 

    The Muslim has to realize that he is in the world of trials 
    and tests, so he must adorn himself with patience in bearing all the things 
    that happen to him in this life. He should turn to Allaah by praying to Him 
    to relieve him of the disasters that have befallen him, for He is the One 
    Who relieves worry and distress, and Who answers the prayer of the one who 
    has been wronged, may He be glorified and praised. Nothing is hidden from 
    Him and there is nothing that He is unable to do in the heavens or on earth, 
    to Him be praise in the beginning and at the end. 

    He is the most generous of those who are generous, and His 
    slave does not seek to draw close to Him but He is even swifter in drawing 
    close to His slave. Al-Bukhaari (6856) and Muslim (4832) narrated in their
    Saheehs that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah says: 
    ‘I am as My slave thinks I am. I am with him when he makes mention of Me. If 
    he makes mention of Me to himself, I make mention of him to Myself; and if 
    he makes mention of Me in an assembly, I make mention of him in an assembly 
    better than it. And if he draws near to Me a hand’s span, I draw near to him 
    an arm’s length; and if he draws near to Me an arm’s length, I draw near to 
    him a fathom’s length. And if he comes to Me walking, I go to him at 
    speed.’” 

    In your case, my sister, Allaah is testing you by means of a 
    man whose behaviour and attitude are bad. Based on what has been mentioned 
    in the question, it is permissible for you to ask for a divorce (this is 
    what is called khula’), because living with this man and anyone like him is 
    something that is unbearable. Perhaps Allaah will compensate you with 
    someone better than this man. If you cannot find another husband, then 
    staying without a husband in your parents’ house, where you will be cared 
    for and respected, will be better for you than staying with this man, so 
    long as you do not fear that you will be tempted or will fall into haraam 
    things. But if you fear that you may be tempted, then being patient and 
    bearing worldly troubles by staying with this man will be better for you 
    than having to bear the punishment of Allaah.

     The reasons for which it is permissible for a woman to seek 
    divorce (khula’) from her husband are mentioned in Question 1859 on 
    this site.

13804,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13804,Is the Quran the Word of Allah?,"May peace and blessings of Allah be upon you. I am writing in hope that you will be able to help me resolve my dilemma. I am a practicing Muslim woman ( 20 years old). I moved to XXX 5 years ago.   My parents were never practicing Muslims, but I've been taught about Islam from my grandmother.  

I've always been a believer in Allah. Until recently I did not know how to perform prayers; however I decided that there is nobody here to teach me so I had to do it myself.  
With the help of Allah, I learned how to perform them, also I started wearing hijab. 
The problem I am writing with is that I've been seeing this guy with whom I fell in love with. 
Unfortunately he is not a Muslim, but also he does not belong to any faith. He does believe in God. I've been trying to convince him to join Islam and become part of the only true religion, otherwise I cannot marry him. (We've been together for 3 years). What I cannot convince him is that Muhammad (pbuh) is the messenger of Allah. He keeps asking me questions like "" How do you know that this is a word of God?
What if Muhammad just made it up as if it is a word from God. Please tell me how to convince him that Quran is a true word from none other but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger. Please help,
He keeps saying that if we were to get married he would not have a problem with me continuing to practice my religion. He is quite proud of me for starting to wear hijab in society where it is not common.

Even though he is a great person and does not do anything bad.  It really hurts when I think that we cannot be together.  Is it a major sin for me to get married to him?

Quran is the word of Allah
With regard to the Quran and the proof that it is the word of Allah, these are specious arguments which were put forward out of stubbornness and arrogance by the first disbelievers to whom the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was sent. Allah refuted what they said in many ways, proving their words to be false and pointing out what was wrong with it. For example: 

In this Quran is a challenge from Allah to mankind and the jinn to produce anything like it, but they were unable to. Then He challenged them to produce only ten surahs like it, and they were unable to. Then He challenged them to produce something like the shortest surah in the Quran , and they could not do it, even though those who were being challenged were the most eloquent and well-spoken of mankind, and the Quran was revealed in their language. Yet despite that they stated that they were completely incapable of doing that. This challenge has remained down throughout history, but not one person has been able to produce anything like it. If this were the word of a human being, some people would have been able to produce something like it or close to it. There is a great deal of evidence for this challenge in the Quran, for example, the ayah (interpretation of the meaning): 

“Say: If mankind and the jinn were together to produce the like of this Quran, they could not produce the like thereof, even if they helped one another.” [al-Isra 17:88]
Allah says, challenging them to produce just ten surahs: 
“Or they say, He (Prophet Muhammad) forged it (the Quran). Say: Bring you then ten forged Surahs (chapters) like unto it, and call whomsoever you can, other than Allah (to your help), if you speak the truth!” [Hud 11:13 interpretation of the meaning]
Allah says, challenging them to produce just one surah: 
“And if you (Arab pagans, Jews, and Christians) are in doubt concerning that which We have sent down (i.e. the Quran) to Our slave (Muhammad), then produce a Surah (chapter) of the like thereof and call your witnesses (supporters and helpers) besides Allah, if you are truthful.” [al-Baqarah 2:23 interpretation of the meaning]

No matter how much knowledge and understanding mankind attains, they will still inevitably make mistakes, forget things or fall short. If the Quran were not the word of Allah, there would be some contradictions and shortcomings in it, as Allah says: 

“Had it been from other than Allah, they would surely have found therein many a contradiction.” [al-Nisa 4:82 interpretation of the meaning]
But it is free from any shortcoming, error or contradiction; indeed, all of it is wisdom, mercy and justice. Whoever thinks that there is any contradiction in it, that is because of his diseased thinking and mistaken understanding; if he refers to the scholars they will explain to him what is correct and clear up the confusion for him, as Allah says: 
“Verily, those who disbelieved in the Reminder (i.e. the Quran) when it came to them (shall receive the punishment). And verily, it is an honourable well fortified respected Book (because it is Allah’s Speech, and He has protected it from corruption). Falsehood cannot come to it from before it or behind it, (it is) sent down by the All Wise, Worthy of all praise (Allah)” [Fussilat 41:41-42 interpretation of the meaning]

Allah has guaranteed to preserve this Quran, and He says: 

“Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Quran) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption)” [al-Hijr 15:9 interpretation of the meaning]
Every letter of it was transmitted by thousands from thousands down throughout history, and not one letter of it was altered. If any person tried to alter anything in it, or add something or take something away, then he would be exposed straight away, because Allah is the One Who has guaranteed to preserve the Quran, unlike the case with other divinely-revealed Books which Allah revealed to the people of a particular Prophet only, and not to all of mankind, so He did not guarantee to preserve them, rather He delegated their preservation to the followers of the prophets. But they did not preserve them, rather they introduced alterations and changes which distorted most of the meanings. The Quran, on the other hand, was revealed by Allah to all of mankind until the end of time, because the Message of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the final message, so the Quran is preserved in men’s hearts and in written form, as is proven by the events of history. How many people have tried to change the verses of the Quran and deceive the Muslims, but they were quickly exposed and their falsehood was discovered, even by Muslim children. 
Another of the definitive signs that this Quran was not produced by the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) but that it came revealed by Allah to him is the following: 

The great miracles which the Quran contains of legislation, rulings, stories and beliefs, which could not be produced by any created being no matter how great his intelligence and level of understanding. No matter how hard people try to promulgate laws to regulate their lives, they can never succeed so long as they are far away from the teachings of the Quran; the further away they are, the greater their rate of failure. This is something that has been proven by the disbelievers themselves.  
Reports of matters of the unseen, both past and future, which no human being could speak of independently, no matter how great his knowledge, especially at that time which is regarded as primitive in terms of technology and modern tools. There are many things which had not been discovered yet, and which have only been discovered after lengthy and difficult exploration with the most modern equipment, but Allah told us about them in the Quran, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) mentioned them, fifteen centuries ago, such as the stages of embryonic development, the nature of the oceans, etc. These things have made some kafirs state that this could only have come from God, as in the case of the development of the embryo: 

Only 60 years ago, researchers confirmed that man does not come into existence all at once, but rather he passes through stages of development one after another. Only 60 years ago, science discovered this one Quranic fact. 
Shaykh al-Zindani said, we met an American professor, one of the greatest American scientists, whose name was Professor Marshall Johnson, and we told him that it says in the Quran that man is created in stages. When he heard this, he was sitting down, but he stood up and said, Stages? We said, That was in the seventh century CE! This Book came and said, man was created in stages. He said, That is impossible, impossible We told him, Why do you say that? This Book says (interpretation of the meaning):  
“He creates you in the wombs of your mothers, creation after creation in three veils of darkness.” [al-Zumar 39:6] 
What is the matter with you, that [you fear not Allah (His punishment), and] you hope not for reward (from Allah or you believe not in His Oneness).
“While He has created you in (different) stages.” [Nuh 71:14]
Then he sat back down on his chair and after a few moments he said, There are only three possibilities. The first is that Muhammad had a huge microscope through which he managed to study these things and he knew things that the people did not know, and he said these things. The second is that this happened by accident, it was a coincidence. The third is that he was a Messenger from God. We said, With regard to the first idea, that he had a microscope and other equipment, you know that a microscope needs lenses, and lenses need glass and technical expertise and other equipment. Some of this information can only be discovered with an electron microscope which needs electricity, and electricity needs knowledge which should have been acquired by an earlier generation. It is not possible for this knowledge to have been acquired all at once in a single generation; the previous generation would have had to strive hard in developing science and transmitting it to the next generation, and so on. But for this to be the work of one man, with no one coming before him or after him, either in his own land or the neighbouring lands for the Romans, Persians and Arabs were ignorant and had no such equipment for one man to have all these instruments and tools which he did not pass on to anyone else this is not possible. He said, Thats right, it would be very difficult. We said, And for it to have been an accident or coincidence, what would you think if we said that the Quran did not mention this fact only in one verse but in several verses, and that it did not refer to it in general terms but that it gave details of every stage, saying that in the first stage such and such happens, in the second stage such and such happens, in the third stage and so on. Could that be a coincidence? When we explained to him all the details of those stages, he said, It is wrong to say that this is an accident! This is well-founded knowledge. We said, Then how do you explain it? He said, There is no explanation except that this is revelation from above!
With regard to the many statements in the Quran concerning the sea, some of these facts were not discovered until very recently, and many of them are still unknown. For example, these facts were discovered after hundreds of marine stations had been set up, and after images had been taken by satellites. The one who said this was Professor Schroeder, one of the greatest oceanographers in West Germany. He used to say that if science advanced, religion would have to retreat. But when he heard the translation of the verses of the Quran, he was stunned and said, These could not be the words of a human being.   And Professor Dorjaro, a professor of oceanography, told us of the latest developments on science, when he heard the verse: 
“Or (the state of a disbeliever) is like the darkness in a vast deep sea, overwhelmed with waves topped by waves, topped by dark clouds, (layers of) darkness upon darkness: if a man stretches out his hand, he can hardly see it! And he for whom Allah has not appointed light, for him there is no light.” [al-Nur 24:40 interpretation of the meaning]
He said:
“In the past, man could not dive to a depth of more than twenty meters because he had no special equipment. But now we can dive to the bottom of the ocean, using modern equipment, and we find intense darkness at a depth of two hundred meters. The ayah says a vast deep sea . The discoveries in the depths of the sea give us an understanding of the verse, (layers of) darkness upon darkness. It is known that there are seven colours in the spectrum, including red, yellow, blue, green, orange, etc. When we dive down into the depths of the ocean, these colours disappear one after another, and the disappearance of each colour results in more darkness. Red disappears first, then orange, then yellow and the last colour to disappear is blue, at a depth of two hundred meters. Each colour that disappears adds to the darkness until it reaches total darkness.  With regard to the phrase waves topped by waves, it has been proven scientifically that there is a separation between the upper and lower parts of the ocean, and that this separation is filled with waves, as if there are waves on the edge of the dark, lower portion of the sea, which we do not see, and there are waves on the shores of the sea, which we do see. So it is as if there are waves above waves. This is a confirmed scientific fact, hence Professor Dorjaro said concerning these Quranic verses, that this cannot be human knowledge.” (Al-Adillah al-Maddiyyah ‘ala Wujud-Allah by Muhammad Mutwalli al-Sha’rawi) 
And there are very many such examples 

In the Quran there are some verses which rebuke the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and mention some things to which Allah drew his attention. Some of them may have been embarrassing for the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). But if this Quran had come from the Messenger of Allah, there would have been no need for this; if he were to conceal any part of the Quran, he would have concealed some of these verses which contained rebukes or drew his attention to certain matters which he should not have done, such as the verse in which Allah says to His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): 

“But you did hide in yourself (i.e. what Allah has already made known to you that He will give her to you in marriage) that which Allah will make manifest, you did fear the people (i.e., their saying that Muhammad married the divorced wife of his manumitted slave) whereas Allah had a better right that you should fear Him.” [al-Ahzab 33:37 interpretation of the meaning]
After this, can there be any doubt left in the mind of any intelligent person that this Quran is the word of Allah, and that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) conveyed that which was revealed to him in full? 
Moreover, we tell this person, try it for yourself, read a sound translation of the Quran and use your mind to ponder these rules and regulations. There is no doubt that any intelligent person who has the power of discernment will see a great difference between these words (of Allah) and the words of any person on the face of the earth. 
Man-woman relationship in Islam
With regard to your relationship with this young man, this noble religion forbids women to mix with men for a great and wise reason. So you have to stop meeting him and break off your relationship with him until he becomes Muslim, in which case you can marry him in a proper Islamic marriage. In the answer to Question no. 1200 you will find an explanation of the rulings on a Muslim woman mixing with non-mahram men. 
With regard to your love for him, this is a test from Allah: will you put your love of Allah before your love for one of His creation, or will you put your love for this person before the love of your Almighty Lord Who has forbidden such things. Note that whoever gives up something for the sake of Allah, Allah will compensate him with something better than that, the first of which is that you will find, in sha Allah, that Allah will compensate you with comfort and tranquility in loving Him and striving to draw closer to Allah by means of that which He loves; so your love for your Lord and your attachment to Him will increase, and  your attachment to all of His creation will become weaker. In the answer to Question no. 10254 you will find some solutions to this problem. 
Can Muslim women marry non-Muslim men?
With regard to the ruling on a Muslim woman marrying a non-Muslim man , this is haram according to scholarly consensus, indeed it is one of the major immoral actions which Allah has forbidden in the Quran. In the answers to Questions no. 8396 and 1825 you will find a detailed response to this question. 
We advise you to be patient and to put up with difficulties, and to keep far away from everything that may cause you to do things that would anger your Lord. Note that Allah has made this world a place of trial and testing for His believing slaves; whoever is patient and refrains from following his desries, seeking the pleasure of Allah, Allah will compensate him with Paradise where He will bestow upon him all kinds of delight which cannot be compared with the fleeting worldly pleasures that he sacrificed. This is in addition to the happiness and tranquility that he will find in his heart when he obeys his Lord. 
Perhaps if he sees how you adhere to your religion and avoid meeting him and sitting with him despite your love for him, he will come to realize the greatness of this religion which makes its followers prepared to sacrifice all that they love in order to please their Lord, and that they hope for a great reward from their Lord for their patience in obeying Him and keeping away from that which He has forbidden and perhaps that will be the cause of his becoming Muslim. 
We ask Allah to guide him to Islam, and to make goodness easy for you, and to keep all evil away from you, Ameen.

13808,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13808,Ruling on a woman marrying someone who attends Mawlid celebrations and practices some innovations,"My sister-in-law will be getting married soon. She is worried about the type of boy she can get married to. To be specific, she has asked me whether it is valid to get married to a person who is a strong supporter of the Mawlid or Milad-un-Nabi practice? I do understand that this practice itself is an innovation in Islam. However, the difficulty is whether one can get married to such people who practice Mawlid. In New XXX, the people involved in this practice, do this as an act of worship. People would be invited to attend this ceremony where various hadith are read, songs are sung and dua is made. People actually stand and sing! I hope this is the practice the fatwaa on your site refers to. The question is whether one can marry those who do this practice? The more difficult question and the one I am afraid to ask is whether these people are Muslims? Sheikh, you do not have to answer the second one if it is not wise to?",,,"Praise be to Allah.With regard to the Mawlid and whether the one who does that is considered to be a Muslim, you will find a detailed answer in the Seasonal topics section of this website. In brief, those who do this are of many kinds, depending on what they do – although the Mawlid is in and of itself bid’ah (an innovation). But the ruling on those who do it depends on what actions contrary to sharee’ah they do in this Mawlid. Therefore the matter may extend as far as shirk and going beyond the pale of Islam, if any actions which are known to constitute kufr are committed on this occasion, such as calling upon anyone other than Allaah, or attributing any divine qualities to the Prophet peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) etc. But if it does not go that far, then the one who attends such events is a faasiq (rebellious evildoer) but not a kaafir, and his fisq (rebellion) varies according to the unIslamic or innovated actions he does in the Mawlid. 
With regard to the issue of marrying a man who participates in things like the Mawlid, the ruling varies according to the state of the man. If he does things that constitute kufr then it is not permissible to marry him under any circumstances, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And give not (your daughters) in marriage to Al-Mushrikoon till they believe (in Allaah Alone) and verily, a believing slave is better than a (free) Mushrik (idolater), even though he pleases you”
[al-Baqarah 2:221]
Such a marriage would be regarded as null and void, according to the consensus of the scholars. 
But if the innovation does not reach the degree of kufr, the scholars still issued a stern warning against marrying innovators. Imaam Maalik (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “Do not marry a woman from among the innovators, or give your daughter in marriage to an innovator, or greet them with salaam…” (al-Mudawwanah, 1/84). Imaam Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on him) said something similar. 
The four Imaams (may Allaah have mercy on them) stated that religious compatibility between the man and woman is one of the matters which must be taken into consideration. A faasiq (rebellious evildoer) is not compatible with a righteous, religiously-committed Muslim woman, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Is then he who is a believer like him who is a Faasiq (disbeliever and disobedient to Allaah)? Not equal are they”
[al-Sajdah 32:18]
Undoubtedly, following innovation in religion is one of the most serious forms of fisq (rebellion, evildoing). Paying attention to religious compatibility means that if the woman discovers that her husband is a faasiq, or if it becomes clear to her guardians that the husband is a faasiq after the marriage contract has taken place, then the woman or her guardians has the right to object to this contract and ask for it to be annulled. But if they choose to forego this right, then the contract is valid. 
Hence we should be careful to avoid such marriages, especially since the man is in charge of the woman (qawwaamah) and he may give the woman a hard time or force her to commit some acts of bid’ah, or make her go against the Sunnah in some matters. With regard to the children, their situation is more serious, because there is the risk that he will bring them up to follow his innovation, so they will grow up following a path other than that of Ahl al-Sunnah. This will cause great hardship and difficulty to their mother who follows the way of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah. 
In conclusion, according to the scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah it is strongly makrooh for a woman to marry a Muslim man who follows bid’ah, because of the bad consequences that will result from that, and because it will cancel out many good things. 
And whoever gives up something for the sake of Allaah, Allaah will compensate him with something better than it. 
And Allaah knows best.

13809,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13809,A man jokes with his mahrams in an obscene fashion,A man has nieces (his brother’s daughters) and he jokes with them in an obscene manner. Is it permissible for them to avoid meeting him because of his obscene jokes?,,,"Praise be to Allah.With regard to this man who has nieces – i.e., he is their paternal uncle – and the woman and the questioner say that he jokes with them in an obscene manner, it is not permissible for the nieces of such an uncle to come to him or to uncover their faces in front of him, because the scholars who say that it is permissible for a woman to uncover her face in front of a mahram allowed that on the condition that there be no fitnah. The fact that this man jokes with his brother’s daughters in an obscene manner means that there is the fear of fitnah from him. So they have to keep away from the causes of fitnah. It is not surprising that someone could feel desire for his mahrams, for we have heard of someone who committed zina with his sister through his father (i.e., his half-sister) because she was not his full sister – we seek refuge with Allaah. And we have heard worse than that, that there is someone who committed zina with his mother – we seek refuge with Allaah. Look at what the Qur’aan says, where Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And marry not women whom your fathers married, except what has already passed; indeed it was shameful and most hateful, and an evil way”[al-Nisa’ 4:22]
And Allaah says concerning zina (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And come not near to unlawful sex [zina]. Verily, it is a Faahishah (i.e. anything that transgresses its limits: a great sin), and an evil way (that leads one to hell unless Allaah forgives him).”[al-Israa’ 17:32]
He does not only say faahishah (shameful, a great sin), He also says, maqt (most hateful). This indicates that having intercourse with a mahram relative or one’s father’s wife who is also a mahram are crimes which are worse than zina. 
So to sum up the answer: 
They must keep away from this uncle and not uncover their faces in front of him so long as they see that he is joking in this manner which makes them have doubts about him.","Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, from Fataawa al-Jaami’ah li’l-Mar’ah al-Muslimah, p. 1006"

Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the Messenger of Allah to all of mankind, the one through whom Allah leads people from darkness into light, from misguidance to guidance. Please see question no. 11575 . 
Perhaps this question is the start of your research into the religion of Islam and your attempt to learn more and read widely about it. Try to find a translation of the meanings of the Quran so that you can learn more about this pure monotheistic religion. No doubt our joy will be multiplied if you become our sister in Islam by entering this religion. 
How to worship Allah in Islam
Acts of worship in Islam are based on an important principle, which is that no one is permitted to worship Allah in any way except that which Allah has prescribed in his Book or which was taught by His Messenger Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
Whoever worships Allah by doing something that Allah and His Messenger have not enjoined, Allah will not accept that from him. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told us of that, as it was narrated that ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Whoever innovates something in this matter of ours [i.e., Islam] that is not part of it will have it rejected.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, Kitab al-Sulh, 2499). 
Acts of worship include festivals. Allah has prescribed two festivals or ‘Eids for us to celebrate, and it is not permissible for us to celebrate any others. (Please see question no. 486 ). 
Is it permissible to celebrate Mawlid al-Nabi (Prophet Muhammad’s birthday)? 
With regard to celebrating the day on which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was born, it should be noted that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not tell us to celebrate this day, and he himself (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not celebrate it, nor did his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them). 
They loved the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) far more than we do, yet despite that they did not celebrate this day. Hence we do not celebrate this day, in obedience to the command of Allah Who has commanded us to follow the commands of His Prophet. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And whatsoever the Messenger (Muhammad) gives you, take it; and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it).” [al-Hashr 59:7]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I urge you to adhere to my Sunnah [way] and the way of the Rightly-Guided khalifas. Adhere to it and cling tightly to it. And beware of newly-invented matters [in religion], for every newly-invented matter is an innovation and every innovation is a going-astray.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, al-Sunnah, 3991; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud, no. 3851). 
The extent to which a person loves the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is to be seen in how he follows him with regard to all that he commanded or forbade. That includes following him in not celebrating the day on which he was born. Please see questions no. 5219 , 10070 . 
How to venerate the day on which the Prophet was born
Whoever wants to venerate the day on which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was born should follow the alternative that is based on Islamic evidence, which is that one should fast on Mondays, not just the day that he was born but every Monday. 
It was narrated from Abu Qatada al-Ansari (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was asked about fasting on Mondays. He said, “On that day I was born and on that day the Revelation came to me.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1978). On Thursdays deeds are taken up and shown to Allah. 
Conclusion
Celebrating the Prophet’s birthday was not prescribed by Allah or by the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), so it is not permissible for the Muslims to celebrate his birthday, in obedience to the command of Allah and the command of His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).

Recommended Acts of Worship on Friday 
There are many acts of worship which are prescribed for the Muslim to do on this day. These include: 
1 – Salat al-Jumu’ah (Friday prayer) 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe (Muslims)! When the call is proclaimed for the Salaah (prayer) on Friday (Jumu‘ah prayer), come to the remembrance of Allah [Jumu‘ah religious talk (Khutbah) and Salaah (prayer)] and leave off business (and every other thing). That is better for you if you did but know!” [Al-Jumu’ah 62:9]
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Zad al-Ma`ad (1/376): 
Friday prayer is one of the most important obligations in Islam, and one of the greatest gatherings of the Muslims. Gathering on Friday is more important and more obligatory than any other gathering apart from `Arafah. Whoever neglects it, Allah will place a seal on his heart. 
It was narrated from Abu’l-Ja’d al-Damari – who was a Companion of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) – that the Prophet said: “Whoever neglects three Jumu’ahs, Allah will place a seal on his heart.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 1052; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud, 928)
It was narrated from ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar and Abu Hurayrah that they heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say on the pulpit: 
“Let people stop neglecting Jumu’ah, or Allah will place a seal on their hearts, then they will be among those who are neglectful.” (Narrated by Muslim, 865) 
2 – Making a lot of du’aa’
On this day there is a time when a person’s Lord will answer his du’a – by Allah’s leave. 
It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) mentioned Friday and said: “On this day there is a time when no Muslim stands and prays, asking Allah for something, but Allah will grant him it” – and he gestured with his hands to indicate how short that time is. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 893; Muslim, 852)
3 – Reading Surat al-Kahf
It was narrated from Abu Sa’id al-Khduri that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever reads Surat al-Kahf on Friday, he will be illuminated with light between the two Fridays.” (Narrated by al-Hakim; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Targhib, 836)
4 – Sending a lot of blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
It was narrated from Aws ibn Aws that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The best of your days is Friday. On that day Adam (peace be upon him) was created; on that day he died; on that day the Trumpet will be blown; and on that day all of creation will swoon. So send a great deal of blessings upon me (i.e. on Friday), for your blessings will be shown to me.” They said, “O Messenger of Allah, how will our blessings upon you be shown to you when you have turned to dust?” He said, “Allah has forbidden the earth to consume the bodies of the Prophets.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 1047; classed as sahih by Ibn al-Qayyim in his comments on Sunan Abi Dawud, 4/273; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, 925. 
He said in ‘Awn al-Ma’bud: 
Friday is singled out because it is the best of days and the chosen day. So there is an advantage to sending blessings upon him on that day that is not present on any other day. 
Along with these virtues and acts of worship, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade singling out Friday for fasting, or singling out the night of Friday for doing acts of worship that are not narrated in sharee’ah.  
It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not single out the night of Friday for qiyaam al-layl, and do not single out the day of Friday for fasting, unless that is part of the habitual fasting of any one of you.” ((Narrated by Muslim, 1144)
Al-San’ani said in Subul al-Salam: 
This hadith indicates that it is haram to single out the night of Friday for worship or reading Qur’an that is not one’s regular custom, apart from that which is indicated in the texts, such as reading Surat al-Kahf. 
Al-Nawawi said: 
This hadith clearly states that it is forbidden to single out the night of Friday for prayer or the day of Friday for fasting. It is agreed (among the scholars) that this is makruh. 
He also said: 
The scholars said that the reason why it is forbidden to single out Friday for fasting is that Friday is a day of du’a, dhikr and worship , such as ghusl, going early to the prayer, waiting for the prayer, listening to the khutbah and reciting a lot of dhikr afterwards, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Then when the (Jumu‘ah) Salaah (prayer) is ended, you may disperse through the land, and seek the Bounty of Allah (by working), and remember Allah much.” (Al-Jumu’ah 62:10)
And there are other acts of worship to be done on this day. So it is preferable not to fast then, as this will help a person to perform these duties in an energetic manner and enjoy them without feeling bored or tired. This is like the pilgrim on the day of ‘Arafah in ‘Arafah, because the Sunnah is for him not to fast on that day for the same reason… This is the reason for not allowing singling out Friday for fasting. And it was said that the reason is so that people will not go to extremes in venerating it as happened in the case of Saturday. But this view is weak, because on that day we offer Jumu’ah prayer and do other acts of worship which are a kind of veneration. And it was said that the reason for its prohibition is so that people would not think that this was obligatory. This is also a weak view because it is encouraged to fast on Mondays and there was no fear that anyone would think it was obligatory. No attention should be paid to this far-fetched view. The same argument is applicable in the case of fasting the day of ‘Arafah and the day of ‘Ashura’, etc. The correct view is that which we have stated above.

13818,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13818,Question about the messiah in Islam,Who is the messiah of islam?,,,"Praise be to Allah.The Muslims do not pin their hopes on someone who will save or deliver them, as is the case with the Jews, the Christians and the Raafidis (Shi’ah). Islam is complete and its rulings are complete. Perhaps what is meant in the question is the Mahdi. He will be one of the reformers of this ummah through whom Allah will fill the earth with justice and fairness after it was filled with injustice and unfairness. Like other reformers, he will follow the Quran and Sunnah and will rule according to them. 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
The issue of the Mahdi is well known and the ahaadeeth which speak of him are numerous and are mutawaatir and support one another. More than one of the scholars has narrated that they are mutawaatir in meaning because of their many isnaads, many narrators and many versions. They indicate that this person whose coming is promised is something real and true. His name will be Muhammad ibn ‘Abd-Allah al-‘Alawi al-Hasani, and he will be a descendent of al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali ibn ‘Abi Taalib (may Allah be pleased with him). By the mercy of Allah towards this ummah, this imam will appear at the end of time and will establish justice and truth and do away with injustice and oppression. Through him Allah will spread justice among the ummah and guide the people. 
I have studied many of the ahaadeeth about him and I saw, as al-Shawkaani and others said, and as Ibn al-Qayyim and others said, that some are saheeh, some are hasan, and some are da’eef (weak) and manjabir (may be proven if there is corroborating evidence), containing fabricated reports. Those which have sound isnaads are sufficient for us, whether they are saheeh in and of themselves (saheeh li dhaatihi) or saheeh because of the existence of corroborating reports (saheeh li ghayri), or hasan in and of themselves (hasan li dhaatihi) or hasan because of the existence of corroborating reports (hasan li ghayrihi). By the same token, if the da’eef (weak reports) corroborate and support one another, then that constitutes evidence according to the scholars. So there are four categories of acceptable hadeeth according to the scholars: saheeh li dhaatihi (saheeh in and of itself), saheeh li ghayrihi (saheeh because of the existence of corroborating reports), hasan li dhaatihi (hasan in and of itself) and hasan li ghayrihi (hasan because of the existence of corroborating reports). 
This has to do with reports other than those which are mutawaatir. All the mutawaatir reports are acceptable, whether they are mutawaatir in wording or in meaning. The ahaadeeth which speak of the Mahdi are mutawaatir in meaning. And the trustworthy scholars have stated that they are sound and mutawaatir. 
We have seen the scholars state many things to be sound on the basis of less evidence than that. The truth of the matter is that the majority of scholars – if not all of them – are agreed that the Mahdi is something proven: he is real and will appear at the end of time. 
With regard to those scholars who hold odd views concerning this matter, no attention is to be paid to what they say on this matter.

Then ‘Eesa ibn Maryam (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) will come down and their leader will say, ‘Come and lead us in prayer,’ but he will say, ‘No, you are leaders for one another, as an honour from Allah to this ummah.’” 
Narrated by Muslim, 156. 
The leader mentioned in this hadeeth is the Mahdi. 
For more reports about the Mahdi, please see question no. 1252. 
Note: 
Some people misunderstand the ahaadeeth about the Mahdi and the descent of ‘Eesa ibn Maryam, so they do not work for Islam or to call people to Allah because they are waiting for the Messiah to come down or for the Mahdi to appear. This is undoubtedly a mistake. The Muslims have to strive to make the word of Allah supreme, to make His religion prevail and to convey the message of truth to all people. We can imagine how much the Muslims would have declined and how weak they would have become if the earlier Muslims had understood this matter in this mistaken manner and acted accordingly. Would they have been able to defeat the Tatars and Crusaders, and conquer other lands? For more information please see question no. (21221)

    The reason that you mention is not an excuse that makes it 
    permissible to look at non-mahram women. You should seek halaal provision, 
    and provision is in the hand of Allaah; that which is with Allaah cannot be 
    obtained by disobeying Him. Rather Allaah has promised the pious (those who 
    fear Him and keep their duty towards Him) that He will make a way for them 
    to get out of every difficulty and He will grant them provision from 
    (sources) they could never imagine, as Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He 
    will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty).

    And He will provide him from (sources) he never could 
    imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allaah, then He will suffice him. 
    Verily, Allaah will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allaah has set a measure 
    for all things”[al-Talaaq 65:2-3]

    What your teacher has told you goes against the words of 
    Allaah: 

    “Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking 
    at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual 
    acts). That is purer for them. Verily, Allaah is All‑Aware of what they 
    do”[al-Noor 24:30 – interpretation of the meaning]
And the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah beu pon him) said in a saheeh hadeeth: “Avert 
    your gaze.” (Narrated by Ahmad, 18715; Muslim, 2159). Who is more deserving 
    of being obeyed, Allaah and His Messenger, or your teachers?! 

    So I advise you to adhere to taqwa and to keep away from that 
    which is haraam. Allaah will make it easy for you by His Leave and His 
    Bounty. You can find more discussion on the rulings on looking at women in

13822,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13822,Praying sitting down with no excuse,"I work at a job where there are hundreds of people in the building. So to avoid performing my prayers late when I get home at night, I go to my car on my breaks and pray while sitting in the drivers seat. I tilt my head to perform Rukuh, and I bow my head further down to perform Sujud. I close my eyes to get Khushoo (concentration). Are my prayers valid?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Standing during an obligatory prayer is one of the pillars or essential parts of the prayer, and it not permissible to omit it unless one is unable to stand because of sickness or intense fear, and the like. If a person omits it deliberately then his prayer is invalid. Hence it is clear to you that what you are doing by performing your prayers whilst sitting down is not permissible because you have no shar’i excuse, and your prayer sitting down is regarded as invalid. The evidence for that is the reports narrated by al-Bukhaari (1117) and others, from ‘Imraan ibn Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: “I had haemorrhoids and I asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about prayer. He said: ‘Pray standing up. If you cannot, them pray sitting down, and if you cannot, then on your side.’” See al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 3/401. (For more details on the rulings on standing in prayer, see Question # 13340). 
Once this is clear to you, then you should note that it is also not permissible for you to delay prayers until after the time for them has passed. Rather you must perform each prayer at the time that is set for it in sharee’ah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, As-Salaah (the prayer) is enjoined on the believers at fixed hours” [al-Nisa’ 4:103]
So you must strive to perform the prayers on time, standing up, in any suitable place, on the condition that the place be taahir (pure, clean). This is one of the things that sharee’ah makes easy, because Allah has given the ummah of Muhammad the unique privilege of permitting prayer in any clean place, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I have been given five things that were not given to anyone before me: I have been supported by fear (struck into the hearts of my enemies) for the distance of a month’s travel; the earth has been made a place of prayer and a means of purification for me, so that whenever the time for prayer comes, any man of my ummah can pray wherever he is; war-booty has been made permissible for me, when it was not permitted to anyone before me; I have been given the power of intercession; and Prophets (before me) were sent only to their own people, but I have been sent to all of mankind.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 335, and others). 
If there is no mosque nearby where you can pray in congregation, then it is permissible for you to pray in any clean place, apart from a few places where Islam forbids praying, such as graveyards and land that has been seized unjustly by force. And Allah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
13830,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13830,Conditions of righteous deeds,When does Allah accept a person’s deeds? What are the conditions for a deed to be righteous and acceptable to Allah?,,,"Praise be to Allah.An action cannot be an act of worship unless it includes two things: complete love and complete humility. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“But those who believe, love Allah more (than anything else)” [al-Baqarah 2:165] 
“Verily, those who live in awe for fear of their Lord” [al-Mu’minoon 23:57]
And Allah mentions them together in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, they used to hasten on to do good deeds, and they used to call on Us with hope and fear, and used to humble themselves before Us” [al-Anbiya’ 21:90]
Once this is understood, we will realize that worship can only be accepted from a Muslim who believes in Allah alone (Tawheed), as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And We shall turn to whatever deeds they (disbelievers, polytheists, sinners) did, and We shall make such deeds as scattered floating particles of dust” [al-Furqaan 25:23]
In Saheeh Muslim (214) it is narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “I said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, during the Jaahiliyyah, Ibn Jud’aan used to uphold the ties of kinship and feed the poor. Will that avail him anything?’ He said, ‘It will not avail him anything because he never said, “O Allah, forgive me my sins on the Day of Judgement”’” – i.e., he did not believe in the resurrection or do good deeds hoping to meet Allah. 
Moreover, the Muslim’s worship will not be accepted unless it meets two basic conditions: 
1 – Sincerity of intention towards Allah, which means that the person’s intention in all his words and deeds, both outward and inward, is to seek the pleasure of Allah and none other. 
2 – It should be in accordance with the sharee’ah which Allah has prescribed, and he should not worship Allah in any other way. That is achieved by following the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and what he brought, and shunning anything that goes against it, and not inventing any new form of worship that has not been narrated in sound reports from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
The evidence for these two conditions is the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So whoever hopes for the Meeting with his Lord, let him work righteousness and associate none as a partner in the worship of his Lord” [al-Kahf 18:110]
Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “ ‘So whoever hopes for the Meeting with his Lord’ means his reward; ‘let him work righteousness’ means, that which is in accordance with the laws of Allah; ‘and associate none as a partner in the worship of his Lord’ this means seeking the Face of Allah alone, with no partner or associate. These two conditions are the basis of acceptable deeds, which must be sincerely for the sake of Allah alone and correct according to the sharee’ah of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
13835,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13835,It is mustahabb to isolate oneself at times of tribulation when the Muslim fears he may lose his religious commitment,"I recently read this hadith which is related by Bukhari but I dont understand its meaning, it goes something like; 'A time will come when the best property of a Muslim will be sheep which he will take to a mountain so as too flee with his realigion from afflictions' Can you lpease try and explain it's meaning to me?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Commentary on the hadeeth. 
This hadeeth was narrated by al-Bukhaari in a number of places in his Saheeh, such as (7088) Kitaab al-Fitan, where he narrated that Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Soon there will come a time when the best wealth a Muslim will have will be sheep which he will take to the mountaintops and places where rain falls, fleeing for the sake of his religious commitment from tribulation.” And Muslim narrated a similar hadeeth in his Saheeh (1888), also from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allaah be pleased with him), which says that a man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said, “Which of the people is best?” He said, “A man who strives in jihad for the sake of Allaah with his wealth and his self.” He asked, “Then who?” He said, “A believer in a mountain pass who worships Allaah and leaves the people alone.” 
The word sha’af [in the second hadeeth] means a mountaintop. The word shi’b [in the first hadeeth] means a gap or pass between two mountains. Al- Nawawi said in Sharh Saheeh Muslim (13/34): “This does not mean the mountain pass itself, rather what is referred to is being alone and isolating oneself. A mountain pass is mentioned as a metaphor because it is usually devoid of people.” 
The hadeeth indicates that it is preferable to isolate oneself from people and not mix with them in cases where a Muslim fears for his religious commitment because of widespread tribulation, where if he mixes with people he cannot be sure that his religious commitment will be safe and that he will not apostatize or deviate from the truth, or fall into shirk or abandon the basic principles and pillars of Islam, and so on. 
Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said in al-Fath (13/42):  “This report indicates that isolation is preferable in the case of one who fears for his religious commitment.” 
Al-Sindi said in his footnotes on al-Nasaa’i (8/124): “This shows that it is permissible to isolate oneself, indeed it is preferable at times of tribulation.” 
In the second hadeeth quoted above the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) mentioned the believer who isolates himself second in virtue only to the mujaahid who fights for the sake of Allaah. Al-Haafiz said in al-Fath (6/6): “The believer who isolates himself is second in virtue only to the mujaahid because the one who mixes with people cannot guarantee that he will not commit sin, and these sins may be greater in number than the hasanaat (rewards for good deeds) that he gains as a result of mixing with people. But being isolated is regarded as preferable only in cases where there is tribulation.” 
As for isolating oneself at times other than times of tribulation when a Muslim fears for his religious commitment, the scholars differed in their views in this case. The majority said that mixing with people is preferable to withdrawing from them, and they quoted several texts as evidence for that, including the following: 
1 – That this was the way of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the Prophets before him (peace be upon them), and the majority of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them). (Sharh Muslim by al-Nawawi, 13/34). 
2 – The report narrated by al-Tirmidhi (5207) and Ibn Maajah (4032), which says that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The believer who mixes with people and patiently bears their annoyance will have a greater reward than the believer who does not mix with people and patiently bear their annoyance.” (Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 2035). 
Al-Sindi said in his footnote on Ibn Maajah (2/493): “This hadeeth indicates that the one who is patient and mixes with people is better than the one who isolates himself.” 
Al-San’aani said in Subul al-Salaam (4/416): “This indicates that mixing with people whereby one enjoins what is good and forbids what is evil and deals with them in a good manner is better than keeping away from them and not putting up with mixing with them.” 
3 – The report narrated by al-Tirmidhi (1574) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: “One of the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came upon a mountain pass where there was a small spring of fresh water, which delighted him because it was so good. He said, ‘What if I were to withdraw from the people and settle in this mountain pass? But I will not do it until I seek the permission of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).’ So he mentioned it to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who said: ‘Do not do that, for if any one of you remains striving for the sake of Allaah, it is better than praying in His House for seventy years. Do you not want Allaah to forgive you and admit you to Paradise? Fight in Allaah's cause. He who fights in Allaah's cause as long as the time between two milkings of a she-camel will be assured of Paradise.’” (It was classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 1348). 
The benefits that the Muslim gains by mixing with people for legitimate shar’i purposes, include establishing the rituals of Islam, increasing the number of the Muslims, spreading all kinds of goodness among them by helping and aiding them etc., attending Jumu’ah (Friday) prayers and prayers in congregation, attending funerals, visiting the sick, attending dhikr circles, etc. (Fath al-Baari, 13/43); Sharh Muslim by al-Nawawi, 13/34).

          may have passed wind, then he should not pay any attention to it. The 
          evidence that the mere movement of gas in the stomach or imagining that 
          one may have passed wind does not invalidate wudoo’ is the hadeeth whose 
          authenticity is agreed upon, narrated from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Zayd, who 
          said: 
 
          “The Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was asked about a man who 
          felt something during his prayer – should he stop praying? He said, 
          ‘No, not unless you hear a sound or detect an odour.’” (Narrated by 
          al-Bukhaari, 1915; Muslim, 540). Al-Nawawi said: this hadeeth sets out 
          the principle that things should remain as they are unless one is certain 
          that they have changed; doubt does not affect the status quo. 
Ibn Hajar 
          said: the majority of scholars followed this hadeeth. 
Paying attention to these doubts 
          may lead to one being affected by insinuating whispers of the Shaytaan 
          (waswaas), so we must not pay attention to that, except in cases where 
          wind is definitely passed. Then wudoo’ is required. Al-Nawawi said, 
          concerning the phrase “unless you hear a sound or detect an odour”: 
          “it is sufficient to know that one or the other is present; it is not 
          a condition that both the sound and the odour be present, according
