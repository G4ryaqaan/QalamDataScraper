The answer said that it is SHIRK to do so. Since I was not aware that amulets are considered SHIRK, am I still guilty of SHIRK? Please advise.",,,"Praise be to Allah.If an amulet is made with something other than Quran or du’aa’s narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), or if it contains symbols, mumbo-jumbo and strange words that cannot be understood, then there is scholarly consensus that it is haraam and constitutes shirk. But if the amulet is made with Quran or du’aa’s narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), then there is a difference of opinion among the salaf, but the correct view is that it is haraam. See question no. 10543. 
The scholars of the Standing Committee said: 
The scholars are agreed that it is haraam to wear amulets if they are made with anything other than Quran, but they differed concerning those that are made with Quran. Some said that it is permissible to wear them and some said that that is not permissible. The view that it is not allowed is more likely to be correct because of the general meaning of the ahaadeeth, and so as to prevent the means that may lead to shirk.""(Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 1/212 )
So you and your wife who asked you for this amulet should remove it straight away and burn it. You said that you did that and you did not know that it was shirk, so you are not to be regarded as a mushrik or a sinner because of this action, since you did not deliberately commit an act of sin.  Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And there is no sin on you concerning that in which you made a mistake, except in regard to what your hearts deliberately intend” [Al-Ahzaab 33:5] 
“Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error” [Al-Baqarah 2:286]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “My ummah is excused for their mistakes, what they forget and what they are forced to do.” 
This evidence indicates that whoever commits a sin but does not know it is a sin, is not to blame, and that Allah has forgiven him.

20213,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20213,She got married without her father’s approval,"My sister married a man who is muslim but she married him against my Father's will. My Father is religios. He rejected that man because he has bad manners so my sister ran away and married without a Wali.
My question is : Is this Marraige Valid?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    You father did well by not agreeing to (your sister’s) 
    marriage to that man who has bad manners. Allaah has put him in a position 
    of trust with regard to his daughters and anyone who is under his care, so 
    he has to make a good choice and find a husband who is suitable from the 
    point of view of sharee’ah. 

    Your sister has done a number of wrong things, such as making 
    a bad choice in choosing this man who has bad manners; running away from her 
    father’s house; and – worst of all – getting married without a wali 
    (guardian). 

    One of these bad deeds would be enough to understand the 
    extent of the wrongs that she has done towards her Lord, herself and her 
    family, so how about if they are combined? 

    With regard to the marriage, it is invalid, because the 
    wali’s consent is one of the essential pillars of a valid marriage. This is 
    what is indicated by the texts of the Qur’aan and Sunnah: 

    1 – Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “do not prevent them from marrying their (former) 
    husbands”

    [al-Baqarah 2:232] 

    2 – Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And give not (your daughters) in marriage to 
    al-Mushrikoon (idolaters) till they believe (in Allaah Alone)”

    [al-Baqarah 2:221]

    3 – Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And marry those among you who are single (i.e. a man who 
    has no wife and the woman who has no husband)”

    [al-Noor 24:32]

    From these verses we may understand that the consent of the 
    wali is an essential condition for marriage, because these verses are 
    addressed to the wali concerning the marriage of the women under his care. 
    If the matter was up to the woman, there would be no need to address the 
    wali, especially in the case of the first verse quoted, as we shall explain 
    below.  

    Part of the fiqh of Imam al-Bukhaari is that he quoted these 
    verses in a chapter which he called Baab man qaala Laa nikaah illa bi 
    wali (Chapter: the view of those who say that there is no (valid) 
    marriage without a wali)’. 

    With regard to the Sunnah: 

    1 – It was narrated that Abu Moosa said: The Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no (valid) 
    marriage without a wali.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1101; Abu Dawood, 2085; 
    Ibn Maajah, 1881. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 
    1/318). 

    2 – It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah said: the Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Any woman who 
    gets married without the permission of her wali, her marriage is invalid, 
    her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid. If the marriage has been 
    consummated then she is entitled to the mahr because she allowed the man to 
    be intimate with her. If she does not have a wali then the ruler is the wali 
    of one who does not have a wali.”

    (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1102; Abu Dawood, 2083; Ibn Maajah, 
    1879. This hadeeth was classed as hasan by al-Tirmidhi and as saheeh by Ibn 
    Hibbaan (9/384) and al-Haakim (2/183)). 

    So your sister has to repent and pray for forgiveness, and 
    she has to go back to her father and ask him to forgive her. She should 
    realize that her marriage is null and void, and so it is not permissible for 
    her to stay with this man because he is not a legitimate husband for her. A 
    new contract should be done in the presence of her wali, if he agrees to her 
    staying with this man, after weighing up the evil of his bad manners versus 
    the evil of her leaving him; or if he does not approve of her staying with 
    him, then the marriage contract is automatically annulled, and this man 
    should be obliged to divorce her so as to avoid any doubts and so that the 
    matter will be final. 

    She should agree to the person whom her father chooses for 
    her, and he has to look for someone person of religious commitment and good 
    manners who fears Allaah who will take good care of his daughter.

20214,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20214,Ruling on jihad and kinds of jihad,In this day and Age is Jihad Fard on every able bodied Man?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
Jihaad is of various kinds, some of which are obligatory upon everyone who is accountable, and some are obligatory upon the community as a whole – if some people undertake them then the rest are relieved of the obligation. And some kinds of jihad are mustahabb. 
Jihad al-nafs (jihad against one’s self) and jihad al-Shaytaan (jihad against the Shaytaan) are obligatory upon everyone who is accountable. Jihad against the munaafiqeen (hypocrites), kaafirs (disbelievers) and leaders of oppression and innovation is obligatory upon the community as a whole. Physical jihad (i.e. fighting) against the kaafirs may become an individual obligation upon everyone who is able to do it in certain circumstances, which will be described below. 
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
Once this is understood, then jihad is of four kinds: Jihad al-nafs (jihad against one’s self), jihad al-Shaytaan (jihad against the Shaytaan), jihad against the kaafirs and jihad against the hypocrites. 
Jihad al-nafs (jihad against one’s self) is of four kinds: 
1 – Striving to learn the teachings of Islam without which one cannot attain success and happiness in this world or in the Hereafter; if this is missing then one is doomed to misery in this world and in the Hereafter. 
2 – Striving to make oneself act in accordance with what one has learned. Simply knowing without acting, even though it may not cause any harm, is not going to bring any benefit. 
3 – Striving to call others to Islam, teaching those who do not know about it. Otherwise one will be one of those who conceal that which Allaah has revealed of guidance and teaching, and it will not benefit him or save him from the punishment of Allaah. 
4 – Striving to bear patiently the difficulties involved in calling people to Allaah and the insults of people; bearing all that for the sake of Allaah. 
If a person achieves all these four levels, then he will be one of the rabbaaniyyeen (learned men of religion who practise what they know and also preach to others. Cf. Aal ‘Imraan 3:79). The salaf were agreed that the scholar does not deserve to be called a rabbaani unless he knows the truth, acts in accordance with it and teaches it to others. Whoever teaches, acts in accordance with his knowledge and has knowledge, he will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. 
Jihad against the Shaytaan is of two types: 
1 – Warding off the doubts that he stirs up to undermine faith. 
2 – Striving against him to ward off the corrupt desires that he provokes. 
The first jihad is followed by certainty of faith, and the second is followed by patience. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And We made from among them (Children of Israel), leaders, giving guidance under Our Command, when they were patient and used to believe with certainty in Our Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.)”
[al-Sajdah 32:24]
Allaah tells us that leadership in religion is attained through patience and certainty of faith. Patience wards off desires and certainty wards off doubts. 
Jihad against the kaafirs and hypocrites is of four kinds: with the heart, the tongue, one’s wealth and oneself. Jihad against the kaafirs is more along the lines of physical fighting whereas jihad against the hypocrites is more along the lines of using words and ideas. 
Jihad against the leaders of oppression and innovation is of three kinds: 
1 – Jihad with one's hand (i.e., physical jihad, fighting) if one is able. If that is not possible then it should be with one's tongue (i.e., by speaking out). If that is not possible then it should be with one's heart (i.e., by hating the evil and feeling that it is wrong). 
These are the thirteen types of jihad, and “Whoever dies without having fought or having resolved to fight has died following one of the branches of hypocrisy.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1910). 
Zaad al-Ma’aad, 3/9-11) 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
“Jihad is of various kinds, with one’s self, one's wealth, by making du’aa’, by teaching and guiding, by helping to do good in any way. The greatest form of jihad is jihad with one’s self (i.e., going oneself and fighting), followed by jihad with one's wealth, jihad by speaking out and guiding others. Da’wah is also part of jihad.  But going out oneself to fight in jihad is the highest form. 
(Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 7/334, 335) 
Secondly: 
The idea of waging physical jihad against the kaafirs went through a number of stages, depending on the state in which the Muslim ummah was. Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
“The first thing which his Lord revealed to him was to read in the name of his Lord who had created. That was the beginning of his Prophethood, where Allaah commanded him to recite to himself but He did not yet command him to convey that. Then He revealed the words (interpretation of the meaning: 
‘O you (Muhammad) enveloped in garments!
Arise and warn!’
[al-Muddaththir 74:1-2]
So he became a Prophet with the word ‘Iqra (Read!) and he became a Messenger with the words, ‘O you (Muhammad) enveloped in garments…’ Then Allaah commanded him to warn his closest kinsmen, then to warn his people, then to warn the Arabs around them, then to warn all the Arabs, then to warn all of mankind. He continued to call them for over ten years from the beginning of his Prophethood, without fighting or imposing the jizyah; he was commanded to refrain, to be patient and to be forbearing. 
Then permission was given to him to migrate, and permission was given to him to fight. 
Then he was commanded to fight those who fought him, and to refrain from fighting those who left him alone and did not fight him. 
Then Allaah commanded him to fight the mushrikeen so that the religion would all be for Allaah. 
After jihad was enjoined upon him, the kaafirs then fell into three categories: those with whom there was a truce or peace treaty; those with whom he was at war; and those who lived under the rule and protection of the Islamic state.” 
(Zaad al-Ma’aad, 3/159) 
Thirdly: 
The ruling on physical jihad against the kaafirs is that this is an obligation on the community as a whole (fard kafaayah). 
Ibn Qudaamah said: 
“Jihaad is an obligation upon the community; if some people undertake it, the rest are relieved of the obligation.” 
What fard kafaayah means is that if it is not undertaken by enough people, then all the people are guilty of sin, but if enough people undertakes it, the rest will be relieved of blame. Initially the command is addressed to all of them, as in the case of an individual obligation (fard ‘ayn), but then in the case of fard kafaayah the obligation is dropped if enough of the people undertake to do it, unlike the case with fard ‘ayn where the obligation is not dropped if someone else does it. Jihad is a fard kafaayah, according to the majority of scholars.” 
(al-Mughni, 9/163) 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz said:  
“We have previously explained on more than one occasion that jihad is fard kafaayah, not fard ‘ayn. All Muslims are enjoined to support their brothers with their selves (i.e., physically, by joining them), or with money, weapons, da’wah and advice. If enough of them go out (to fight), the rest are freed from sin, but if none of them do that then all of them are sinners. 
The Muslims in Saudi Arabia, Africa, North Africa and elsewhere are obliged to do their utmost, and if there is a jihad in one country, the surrounding countries should hasten to help them, the closest then the next closest.  If one or two states, or three or more, manage to fulfil the obligation, then the rest are freed of responsibility. They deserve to be supported, and it is obligatory to help them against their enemies, because they are oppressed. Allaah has enjoined jihad upon all Muslims, and they must fight against the enemies of Allaah until their brothers are victorious. If they fail to do that then they are sinners, but if sufficient people undertake to do that, then the rest are absolved of sin.” 
(Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 7/335) 
Fourthly: 
Physical jihad against the kaafirs becomes obligatory in four cases, which are: 
1 – When the Muslim is present in a jihad situation.
2 – When the enemy has come and attacked a Muslim land
3 – When the ruler mobilizes the people, they must respond.
4 – When a person is needed and no one else can do the task except him. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: 
Jihad is obligatory and becomes fard ‘ayn if a person is present where fighting is going on. This is the first of the situations in which jihad becomes an individual obligation, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! When you meet those who disbelieve, in a battlefield, never turn your backs to them.
And whoever turns his back to them on such a day — unless it be a stratagem of war, or to retreat to a troop (of his own), — he indeed has drawn upon himself wrath from Allaah. And his abode is Hell, and worst indeed is that destination!”
[al-Anfaal 8:16]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said that running away on the day when the army is advancing is one of the sins that doom a person to Hell. He said: “Avoid the seven sins that doom a person to Hell…” among which he mentioned running away on the day when the army is advancing (agreed upon). But Allaah has made exceptions in two cases: 
1-When it is a military manoeuvre, in the sense that he is leaving to bring reinforcements.
2-When he is going to join another group, when he has been told that there is a group of Muslims elsewhere who are about to be defeated, so he goes to join them in order to strengthen their numbers. This is subject to the condition that there is no risk to the group he is in; if there is a risk to the group that he is in, then it is not permissible for him to go to the other group. In this case (jihad) is an individual obligation upon him (fard ‘ayn) and it is not permissible for him to leave.
The second situation (in which jihad becomes an individual obligation) is when a city is besieged by the enemy. Then he has to fight in defence of the city, because when the city is besieged there is no alternative but to defend it, for if the enemy is going to prevent people from leaving the city or entering it, and prevent provisions from reaching it, and other things which are well known, then in this case the people of the city are obliged to fight in order to defend their city. 
The third situation is when the leader tells the people to mobilize; the leader (imam) is the highest authority in the state, but he need not necessarily be the leader of all the Muslims, because there has been no leader of all the Muslims (khaleefah) for a long time. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Listen and obey, even if you are ruled by an Abyssinian slave.” So if a man becomes a leader, then his word is to be heeded and his commands are to obeyed.

20219,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20219,Who Should Lead the Prayer?,"I would be very grateful if you answer my questions :
Q1: Could you tell me who has the most right to lead salah and could you back it up with the Quran and hadiths as well?
Q2: When we are doing ياikr is it ok to say (ill-Allah) and what does it mean?",The one who most deserves to lead the prayer is the one who has the most knowledge of the rulings on prayer and has memorized the most Quran.,"Who should lead the prayer?


Is there a dhikr called Illa-Allah?","Praise be to Allah.Who should lead the prayer?
The one who most deserves to lead the prayer is the one who has the most knowledge of the rulings on prayer and has memorized the most Quran. 
Abu Mas’عd al-Ansari said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The people should be led in prayer by the one who has most knowledge of the Book of Allah; if they are equal in knowledge of the Quran, then by the one who has most knowledge of the Sunnah.” (Narrated by Imam Muslim, 1530) 
What is meant by “the one who has most knowledge of the Quran” is not the one who can recite it most beautifully, but rather the one who has memorized more of the Book of Allah . This is indicated by the hadith of ‘Amr ibn Salamah who said: “I used to memorize those words – meaning the Quran – and it was as if it took root in my heart. When Makkah was conquered, then every tribe hastened to embrace Islam, and my father urged our tribe to hasten to embrace Islam. When my father returned (from the Prophet) to his tribe, he said, ‘By Allah, I have come to you from the true Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)!’ The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) afterwards said to them, ‘Offer such-and-such a prayer at such-and-such a time, and when the time for the prayer becomes due, then one of you should pronounce the Adhan (for the prayer), and let the one amongst you who knows most Quran lead the prayer.’ So they looked for such a person and found none who knew more Quran than I, because of what I used to learn from the people. So they made me their imam (to lead the prayer) and at that time I was a boy of six or seven years.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 4051) 
We say that it is essential for the imam to know the rulings on prayer, because he may do something, such as not breaking his wudu, or missing out a rak`ah, and not know what to do about it, in which case he would make a mistake and cause the prayer of others to be imperfect or invalid altogether. 
Based on the hadith quoted above, some of the scholars said that the one who has more knowledge of fiqh should lead the prayers. 
Al-Nawawi said: 
“Malik, al-Shafi’i and their companions said that the one who has more knowledge of fiqh should take precedence over the one who knows more Quran, because what he needs of recitation is known but what he needs of fiqh may not be clear. There may arise during the prayer some matter where only a person who has complete knowledge of fiqh will be able to know the right thing to do. They said that this is the reason why the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) to lead the prayer rather than anyone else, even though he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had stated that others had more knowledge of Quran than him. But some refuted this point by quoting the hadith that said that the Companions who had most knowledge of Quran were also those who had most knowledge of fiqh. But there is another hadith according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If they are equal in knowledge of Quran, then the one who has most knowledge of the Sunnah,” which indicates that those who have most knowledge of Quran should be given precedence in all cases.” (Sharh Muslim, 5/177) 
Even though al-Nawawi differed with his imam al-Shafi`i with regard to the interpretation of the hadith, their words illustrate the basic principle that there was no one among the Companions who had a good knowledge of the Quran but was ignorant of the rulings of Shari`ah, as is the case among many people nowadays. 
Ibn Qudamah said: 
“If one of them has more knowledge of the rulings on prayer, and the other has more knowledge of matters other than prayer, then the one who has more knowledge about prayer should be given precedence.” (Al-Mughni, 2/19) 
The Standing Committee said: 
“If this is understood, then it is not permissible for one who is ignorant to lead the prayer unless he is leading others like him, if there is no one who is better qualified to lead the prayer.” (Fatawa Islamiyyah, 1/264) 
Is there a dhikr called Illa-Allah?
We do not understand what is meant in the question. The phrase “ill-Allah” is not dhikr on its own, and it is not mentioned in any dhikr on its own. Rather it comes as part of another phrase, namely La ilaha illa-Allah wahdahu la sharika lah, lahu’l-mulk wa lahu’l-hamd wa huwa ‘ala kulli shay’in qadir (There is no god but Allah Alone, with no partner or associate; His is the Sovereignty and to Him be praise, and He is able to do all things). And it appears in many other dhikrs.

    laughing too much has an effect on the Muslim’s heart and distracts him from thinking deeply and fearing Allaah. The Messenger  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) warned us against laughing too much, and told us of the danger it poses to the heart when he said: “Do not laugh 
    too much, for laughing deadens the heart.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2305; Ibn Maajah, 4193. 
However, there is no 
    specific du’aa’ that has been narrated for dealing with this particular problem. Rather you can call upon Allaah in whatever words you wish and 
    ask Him, for He is the All-Hearing and Ever-Responsive, to relieve you of this problem and to give you a heart that is humble before Him and a 
    tongue that remembers Him and an eye that weeps with fear of Him. 
You should also read Qur’aan 
    a great deal and ponder its meanings, and remember Allaah a great deal, make du’aa’ and turn to Him in all your affairs. 
With regard to the sickness 
    that you mention, we ask Allaah to heal you from it. It was the practice of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), if he 
    suffered some complaint, to recite verses seeking refuge with Allaah over himself and then spit drily. This was narrated by al-Bukhari (4728) and 
    Muslim (5679). It is also Sunnah for the sick person to put his hand on the part of his body that is suffering pain and say “Bismillaah (in 
    the name of Allaah)” three times, then to say seven times: “A’oodhu Billaahi wa qudratihi min sharri ma ajidu wa uhaadhir (I seek refuge in 
    Allaah and His power from the evil of what I feel and what I fear).” Narrated by Muslim, 5701.
 Finally I wish to point out 
    to you that going to doctors and taking medicine does not conflict with believing in Allaah and putting your trust in Him. Rather perfect trust in 
    Allaah means availing oneself of the physical or material means as well as having complete faith that healing comes from Allaah, and that there is 
    no healing except His healing.

Making herself beautiful for her husband is one of the things that a woman should do. The more beautiful a woman looks for her husband, the more that will make him love her and that will create harmony between them. This is one of the objectives of sharee’ah, so if the makeup makes her look more beautiful and does not harm her, there is nothing wrong with that. 
But I have heard that make-up can damage the skin of the face and change it in ways that make it look ugly and age the skin prematurely. I hope that women will ask their doctors about that, and if it is proven, then using make-up will be deemed to be either haraam or makruh at the very least, because everything that causes deformity or makes a person ugly is either haraam or makruh.
 I would like to use this opportunity to discuss nail polish, which forms a layer on the nails. It is not permissible to use this if a woman is praying, because it prevents the water from reaching the nails when doing wudoo’ or ghusl, and it is not permissible to use anything that will prevent water from reaching the skin or nails when doing wudoo’ or ghusl. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“wash your faces and your hands (forearms) up to the elbows…” [Al-Maa’idah 5:6]
So if a woman is wearing nail-polish which prevents water from reaching her nails, then she is not really washing her hands, which means that she has omitted one of the obligatory parts of wudoo’ and ghusl. But if she is not praying, there is nothing wrong with her using it, unless this action is one of the unique characteristics of kaafir woman, in which case it is not permissible because it involves imitating them.

A realistic look at marriage to women of the People of the Book


Can you force your Christian wife to become Muslim?","Praise be to Allah.Can Muslims Marry Christians?
Allah has permitted a Muslim man to marry Jewish and Christian woman , on condition that they are chaste and avoid zina (unlawful sexual relations), and that the husband of that Christian woman (who is a Muslim) will then have wilayah over her. 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Made lawful to you this day are At-Tayyibat [all kinds of Halal (lawful) foods, which Allah has made lawful (meat of slaughtered eatable animals, milk products, fats, vegetables and fruits)]. The food (slaughtered cattle, eatable animals) of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) is lawful to you and yours is lawful to them. (Lawful to you in marriage) are chaste women from the believers and chaste women from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before your time when you have given their due Mahr (bridal-money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage), desiring chastity (i.e. taking them in legal wedlock) not committing illegal sexual intercourse, nor taking them as girlfriends. And whosoever disbelieves in Faith, [i.e. in the Oneness of Allah and in all the other Articles of Faith i.e. His (Allah’s) Angels, His Holy Books, His Messengers, the Day of Resurrection and Al-Qadar (Divine Preordainment)], then fruitless is his work; and in the Hereafter he will be among the losers.” [Al-Maidah 5:5]
What is meant by chaste is refraining from zina (unlawful sexual relationships). 
Ibn Kathir said: 
“This is the view of the majority, which is the most correct opinion, so as to avoid the combination of her being a non-Muslim with her being unchaste, which would mean that she is totally corrupt and thus her husband will get, as the Arabic proverb says, “Bad goods and cheated on the weight.” The apparent meaning of the ayah is that what is meant is those who are chaste and refrain from zina.” (Tafsir Ibn Kathieer, 3/55) 
The condition of the woman’s wali being a Muslim is indicated by the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And never will Allah grant to the disbelievers a way (to triumph) over the believers.” [Al-Nisa 4:141]
However, we do not advise you to marry a non-Muslim woman, nor do we advise you to marry just any Muslim woman. For married life is not based only on beauty and attraction, rather the wise Muslim must look with insight at what is beyond that, because he needs to be sure that his house will be looked after in his absence, and he needs to bring up his children, and he will not be able to find that or other things which every wise husband seeks, except with a religious Muslim woman. This is the advice of our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “A woman may be married for four reasons: her wealth, her lineage, her beauty and her religious commitment. Choose the one who is religious, may your hands be rubbed with dust [i.e., may you prosper].” ((Narrated by al-Bukhari, 4802; Muslim, 1466) 
Al-Nawawi said: 
“The correct meaning of this hadith is that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was describing what people usually do, for they seek these four characteristics, the last of which in their view is religious commitment, but you, the one who is seeking guidance, should look for a wife who is religious. But this is not an absolute command. 
This hadith encourages keeping company with people who are religiously committed in all things, because the one who keeps company with them will benefit from their good attitude and morals, their blessing and their good ways, and he will be safe from mischief at their hands.” (Sharh Muslim, 10/52) 
A realistic look at marriage to women of the People of the Book
But marriage to women of the People of the Book leads to a great deal of mischief and trouble, such as: 

He may have to be courteous to this wife of his at the expense of his religion, especially if she is “very committed” to her own religion. This may mean that she will hang up crosses and go to the church, and the children will not be safe in this environment.
She is not going to wash properly after finishing her period, or tell him not to have intercourse with her when she is menstruating; she is going to make him do something that is wrong according to shari’ah and cause him physical harm.
He is going to be put in an embarrassing situation because of her careless attitude concerning dress and her mixing with men and speaking to them.
The states and governments of these women of the Book will be on their side and will give them custody of the children if differences arise and divorce takes place. This will cause these children to be lost and to fall into kufr. Such cases are too well known to need mentioning here and too many to count.

It may be said: 
Marriage to a Christian is not ideal as the likelihood of the children becoming Christian is high..
You must look for one who is religiously committed, if you want a sound marriage.
Forget about the people of kufr and beware of marrying them, for that will lead to a lot of evil.
The children of such a marriage will not be guided; they will swell the ranks of evildoers. 
Can you force your Christian wife to become Muslim?
It is not permissible for you to force your Christian wife – if you do marry her – to become Muslim. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“There is no compulsion in religion. Verily, the Right Path has become distinct from the wrong path. Whoever disbelieves in Taghut [falsehood, false gods] and believes in Allah, then he has grasped the most trustworthy handhold that will never break. And Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower.” [Al-Baqarah 2:256]
Ibn Kathir said: 
“Allah says: “There is no compulsion in religion ” meaning: do not force anyone to enter Islam, for it is obvious and clear, and its proof and evidence are apparent. There is no need to force anyone to enter it, rather whomever Allah guides to Islam and opens his heart to it and illuminates his insight will enter it with conviction; but whoever Allah makes blind in his heart and seals his hearing and insight will not benefit from being compelled to enter the religion by force. They said that the reason for the revelation of this verse was concerning some people among the Ansar, even though this ruling is general.” (Tasfieer Ibn Kathir, 1/311) 
We advise you – once again – to leave this woman and to pray to Allah to guide your heart to that which is in the best interests of your religion. So long as you give her up for the sake of Allah, then you should be certain that Allah will replace her for you with someone better, for whoever gives up something for the sake of Allah, Allah will compensate him with something better.

How to lower your gaze","Praise be to Allah.Prohibition to look at non-mahram women
We have said here many times that it is not permissible for one who has no legitimate Shar’i excuse to remain in the non-Muslim lands. This land is filled with disbelief, immorality and sin, and people there deviate from the fitrah (sound innate human nature) with which Allah has created them. One of the immoral actions that are widespread in those countries is immoral and wanton display (tabarruj), whereby women hardly wear anything that covers them, as the questioner has said. 
This situation leads to haram things and major sins, including mixing , touching and zina (unlawful sexual relationships), all of which stem from looking. 
Shari`ah came to forbid the ways that lead to immorality, one of which is looking at non-mahram women. 

Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts).” [Al-Nur 24:30]
Imam Ibn Kathir said: 
“This is a command from Allah to His believing slaves to lower their gaze and refrain from looking at that which is forbidden to them. So they should not look at anything except that which they are permitted to look at, and they should lower their gaze and refrain from looking at forbidden things. If it so happens that a person’s gaze accidentally falls upon something forbidden, he should quickly avert his gaze.” (Tafsir Ibn Kathi, 3/282) 

Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“And when you ask (his wives) for anything you want, ask them from behind a screen, that is purer for your hearts and for their hearts.” [Al-Ahzab 33:53]

It was narrated that Jarir ibn ‘Abd-Allah said: “I asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about a sudden glance, and he commanded me to avert my gaze.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2159) 

Al-Nawawi said: 
“What is meant by a “sudden glance” is when a person’s glance unintentionally falls upon a non-mahram woman. There is no sin on him for the first glance , but he must avert his gaze immediately. If he averts his gaze immediately there is no sin on him, but if he continues looking, then he will be a sinner, because of this hadith, for the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded him to avert his gaze, and Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things).” [Al-Nur 24:30]
Men must lower their gaze and refrain from looking at them in all circumstances, unless that is for a valid Shar`i reason, such as giving testimony, medical treatment, wanting to propose marriage, buying a slave woman, engaging in financial transactions such as buying and selling, etc. In all these cases it is permissible to look as much as is needed, and no more. And Allah knows best.” (Sharh Muslim, 14/139)
How to lower your gaze
There are means which help a person to lower his gaze, and we ask Allah to help you to do them: 

Bearing in mind the fact that Allah is watching you, that He sees you and is with you (by His knowledge) wherever you go. It may be a secretive glance of which your neighbour is unaware, but Allah knows of it. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“Allah knows the fraud of the eyes, and all that the hearts conceal.” [Ghafir 40:19]

Seeking the help of Allah, beseeching Him and calling upon Him (du`a). Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“And your Lord said: Invoke Me [i.e. believe in My Oneness (Islamic Monotheism) and ask Me for anything] I will respond to your (invocation).” [Ghafir 40:60]

You should know that every blessing you enjoy comes from Allah, and requires that you should give thanks. Part of the gratitude for the blessing of sight means that you should protect it from looking at that which Allah has forbidden. Is there any reward for good, other than good? [al-Rahman 55:60] Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“And whatever of blessings and good things you have, it is from Allah.” [Al-Nahl 16:53]

Striving with yourself and training yourself to lower your gaze and be patient in doing so, and not giving up. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning: 

“As for those who strive hard in Us (Our Cause), We will surely guide them to Our paths (i.e. Allah’s religion — Islamic Monotheism).” [Al-‘Ankabut 29:69]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever seeks to be chaste, Allah will make him chaste, and whoever seeks to be independent of means, Allah will make him independent of means, and whoever strives to be patient, Allah will make him patient…” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1400) 

Avoiding places where a person feels he will be exposed to the temptation of looking, if he can manage to avoid them, such as going to marketplaces or malls, and sitting in the street. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Beware of sitting in the street.” They said, “We have no alternative; that is where we sit and talk.”  He said, “If you insist on sitting there, then give the street its rights.” They said, “What are the rights of the street?” He said, “Lowering the gaze and refraining from causing offense…” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2333; Muslim, 2121) 
You should realize that you have no choice in this matter, regardless of what the circumstances are and no matter how great the temptation or motive to do evil, and no matter what emotions and overwhelming desires stir in your heart. You must lower your gaze and refrain from looking at haram things in all places and at all times. You cannot use excuses such as the environment being corrupt or justify your mistakes by saying that there is a lot of temptation around. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“It is not for a believer, man or woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decreed a matter that they should have any option in their decision. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, he has indeed strayed into a plain error.” [Al-Ahzab 33:36]

Doing a lot of nafl acts of worship, because doing a lot of them whilst also regularly doing obligatory acts of worship is a means of protecting one's physical faculties. According to a hadith qudsi, Allah said: “… and My slave continues to draw close to Me with supererogatory (nafl) works so that I shall love him. And when I love him, I am his hearing with which he hears, his seeing with which he sees, his hand with which he strikes and his foot with which he walks. Were he to ask (something) of Me, I would surely give it to him, and were he to ask Me for refuge, I would surely grant him it.” (Al-Bukhari, 6137) 
Remembering that the earth on which sin is committed will bear witness. Allah says: 

“That Day it will declare its information (about all that happened over it of good or evil).” [Al-Zalzalah 99:4]

Remembering the angels who are recording your deeds. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“But verily, over you (are appointed angels in charge of mankind) to watch you, Kiraman (Honourable) Katibin —writing down (your deeds), They know all that you do.” [Al-Infitar 82:10-12]

Bearing in mind some of the texts which forbid letting the gaze wander freely, such as the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):

“Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things).” [Al-Nur 24:30]

Avoiding looking unnecessarily, so that you only look at what you need to look at, and you do not let your gaze wander right and left so that it falls upon something the effects and fitnah of which cannot be got rid of quickly. 
Marriage, which is one of the most effective remedies. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever can afford it, let him get married, for it is more effective in lowering the gaze and in guarding one’s chastity. And whoever cannot afford it, let him fast, for it will be a shield for him.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1806; Muslim, 1400) 
Fasting – because of the hadith quoted above. 
Doing obligatory acts of worship as Allah has commanded, such as prayer. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“Verily, As-Salah (the prayer) prevents from Al-Fahsha (i.e. great sins of every kind, unlawful sexual intercourse) and Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism, and every kind of evil wicked deed).” [Al-‘Ankabut 29:45]

Remembering al-hur al-‘in, which will give you a motive to be patient in avoiding that which Allah has forbidden, hoping to get al-hur al-‘in . Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“Companions of Equal Age.” [Al-Naba 78:33] 
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “… If a woman of the people of Paradise were to look out over the people of this earth, it would light up everything in between and fill it with fragrance, and the veil of her head is better than this world and everything in it.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2643) 

Bearing in mind the shortcomings of the one who is looked at and the filth and waste material they carry in their gut. 
Being ambitious and focusing on nobler things.  
Checking on yourself from time to time and striving to make yourself lower your gaze whilst realizing that everyone makes mistakes. 
Thinking of the pain and regret that will result from this looking, and the effects of letting one’s gaze wander. 
Understanding the benefits of lowering one's gaze, as mentioned above. 
Bringing up this topic in meetings and gatherings, and explaining its dangers. 
Advising your relatives, telling them not to wear clothes that attract attention and show their attractions, such as how they dress, wearing bright colours, how they walk, speaking too softly, etc. 
Warding off passing thoughts and whispers from the Shaytan before they take hold and are acted upon. Whoever lowers his gaze after the first glance will be saved from innumerable problems, but if he keeps looking he cannot be certain that seeds that will be difficult to remove will not be planted in his heart. 
Being afraid of a bad end, and of feeling regret at the point of death. 
Keeping company with good people, because you are naturally affected by the characteristics of the people you mix with, and a person will follow the way of his close friend, and a friend will pull you to follow his way. 
Knowing that the zina of the eye is looking, and that should be sufficient to put you off.

There is no human being who does not commit sin, and the best of them are those who hasten to repent. It was narrated from Anas that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Every son of Adam commits sin and the best of those who commit sin are those who repent.” (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi, 2499; Ibn Majah, 4251; classed as good by Al-Albani in Sahih Al-Jami`, 3428.

Will Allah accept your repentance?
And Allah has told us that He accepts the repentance of His slaves and forgives them; indeed He turns their bad deeds into good deeds. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And He it is Who accepts repentance from His slaves, and forgives sins, and He knows what you do.” [Ash-Shura 42:25] 
“Except those who repent and believe (in Islamic Monotheism), and do righteous deeds; for those, Allah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [Al-Furqan 25:70]
Can you repent without Wudu or Ghusl?
Allah has not commanded the person who repents to do Wudu or Ghusl, whether his impurity is minor or major, either before or after repenting, unless he is repenting from disbelief or apostasy. 
The scholars of the Standing Committee said: 
“Ghusl is not required after sincere repentance from sin, because the basic principle is that it is not prescribed, and we do not know of any evidence that differs from this principle except if the person is repenting from disbelief, because it is prescribed for the one who enters Islam to do Ghusl, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded Qays ibn `Asim to do that when he became Muslim. (Narrated by Imam Ahmad, Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi and An-Nasa’i; classed as authentic by Ibn As-Sakan) ( Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 5/317)
Conditions of repentance in Islam
The conditions of repentance according to the scholars are well known; they do not include Wudu or Ghusl. These conditions are as follows: 

Sincerity in repentance .
Giving up the sin.
Regretting the sin.
Resolving not to go back to the sin.
Repenting at the time when repentance is accepted, for Allah does not accept repentance once the death rattle reaches the throat when the soul is being taken, or after the sun rises from the west.
Restoring rights to people if the sin had to do with transgressions against the rights of other people.

But what is meant by the excuse of ignorance, ignorance of the obligation of salaah? or igno orance of the fact that abandoning prayer intentionally is kufr?  
Please explain with some quotations from the salafi ulema.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The ignorance for which a person may be excused is ignorance of the ruling. Whoever does not do an obligatory action because he does not know that it is obligatory, or he does a forbidden action because he does not know that it is forbidden, is an ignorant person who may be excused for his ignorance. 
But if a person knows that something is forbidden and he does it, but he is ignorant of the punishment for that, he has no excuse, because he has knowingly committed a sin and transgressed the bounds. 
If a person commits zina – for example – and does not know that zina is haram, he will not be punished and is excused for his ignorance. But if a person knows that zina is haram but he does not know that the one who commits zina deserves the hadd punishment, then he has no excuse and the hadd punishment must be carried out on him, if the conditions for that are met. 
Similarly, if a person does not pray and he does not know that prayer is obligatory, he is to be excused for his ignorance and is not regarded as a kaafir. But if a person does not pray and he knows that not praying is haram but he does not know that not praying is kufr, then he is not to be excused. 
There follows some evidence for the above, as well as some comments of the scholars: 
(A)If a person is ignorant of the ruling on the forbidden action and does it, and there is some hadd punishment or expiation required for that, it is not required in his case.
The evidence for that is the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to a person who confessed that he had committed zina: “Do you know what zina is?” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 4428. This hadith was also reported in al-Saheehayn. 
Ibn al-Qayyim – who classed the report of Abu Dawood as saheeh – said: The hadd punishment is not due for one who was ignorant of the fact that it is forbidden, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked him about the ruling on zina, and he said: I did with her wrongfully haram what a man does with his wife lawfully.  
Zaad al-Ma’aad, 5/33. 
(B)If he knows that it is haram but is ignorant of the consequences, whether a hadd punishment, required expiation or anything else, then the hadd punishment must be carried out on him because he dared to do something haram, and he must offer the expiation if the sin requires expiation.
The evidence for that is the hadeeh of Maa’iz (may Allah be pleased with him) who confessed that he had committed zina, in which he said: “O people, take me back to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), for my people deceived me and killed me.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 4420; its isnaad was classed as jayyid by al-Albaani (may Allah have mercy on him) in al-Irwa’, 7/354. This Sahaabi (may Allah have mercy on him) knew that it was haram but he was unaware of the punishment. 
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This indicates that ignorance of the punishment does not excuse a person from the punishment if he knew that it is haram. Maa’iz did not know that the punishment was execution, but this ignorance did not excuse him from the punishment. 
Zaad al-Ma’aad, 5/34. 
Similarly, the Sahaabi who had intercourse with his wife during the day in Ramadaan did it deliberately and knew that it was haram. As was pointed out by al-Haafiz ibn Hajar in al-Fath (4/207), this is indicated by the fact that he said “I am doomed” – or according to another report, “I am burned.”  The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ruled that he had to offer expiation, and did not excuse him because he was unaware of it. This was narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1834; Muslim, 1111. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
If someone were to say: Wasn’t the man who came to the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ignorant? 
The answer is: He was ignorant of what was required of him; he was not ignorant of the fact that this was haram. Hence he said, “I am doomed.” If we say that ignorance is an excuse, we are not referring to ignorance of the consequences of this haram action, rather we are referring to ignorance of the ruling on this action and whether it is haram or not. Hence if a person commits zina and is ignorant of the fact that it is haram, and he does not live in a Muslim country, or he is new in Islam, or he lives in a remote area and does not know that zina is haram, then no hadd punishment is to be carried out on him. But if he knows that zina is haram, but he does not know that the hadd punishment for it is stoning, or lashing and banishment, then the hadd punishment should still be carried out on him, because he has transgressed a sacred limit. Ignorance of the consequences of a haram action is no excuse. Ignorance of whether an action is haram or not is an excuse.

Thank you in advance for your response.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Who has instilled in you the desire to 
    enter Islam. We thank you for your question about how to enter the religion 
    of Allaah, for no one will be saved on the Day of Resurrection but those who 
    follow it. Allaah says in the Holy Qur’aan:
    
    “And whoever seeks a religion other 
    than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will 
    be one of the losers”

    [Aal ‘Imraan 3:85]
Entering Islam is very 
    easy and is not a complicated matter. All you have to do is to utter the 
    Shahaadatayn (the twin testimony of faith), which is the key to Islam and 
    the sum and basis of the faith. You have to say “Ash-hadu an laa ilaaha 
    ill-Allaah wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadan Rasool-Allaah (I bear witness 
    that there is no god except Allaah and I bear witness that Muhammad is the 
    Messenger of Allaah)”; then take a bath (ghusl) with the intention of 
    purifying yourself in order to pray and practise the rituals of the Islamic 
    religion, the greatest of which is prayer, which connects the person to his 
    Lord. For more details on how to do that, see Question no. 13340 and 11497. 
    You also have to believe with certainty that ‘Eesa ibn Maryam (Jesus the son 
    of Mary – peace be upon him) is the slave of Allaah and His Messenger, not a 
    god or the son of God; rather he is a human being whom Allaah sent with the 
    Message of Divine Oneness (Tawheed) and that only Allaah is to be 
    worshipped, with no partner or associate. Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meanings): 
“No son (or offspring) 
    did Allaah beget, nor is there any ilaah (god) along with Him”
[al-Mu’mineen 23:91] 
“The Messiah [‘Eesa 
    (Jesus)], son of Maryam (Mary), was no more than a Messenger; many were the 
    Messengers that passed away before him. His mother [Maryam (Mary)] was a 
    Siddeeqah [i.e. she believed in the Words of Allaah and His Books (see Verse 
    66:12)]. They both used to eat food (as any other human being, while Allaah 
    does not eat)”
[al-Maa'idah 5:75]

     This shows you that Islam respects ‘Eesa (Jesus – peace be 
    upon him) and his mother, without exaggerating about them or falling into 
    shirk (polytheism, the association of others in worship with Allaah).

     We would also like to point out that although the motive for 
    your becoming Muslim at this stage may be your desire to marry a Muslim 
    woman, if you become Muslim and learn more about this religion and really 
    put it into practice in your life, then your faith will become stronger,

    The one who took care of him was his grandfather ‘Abd 
    al-Muttalib, then after his grandfather died, his paternal uncle Abu Taalib 
    took care of him. Both of them died as disbelievers, but ‘Abd al-Muttalib 
    died before the Prophet’s mission began. Abu Taalib died about ten years 
    after the Prophet’s mission began, after refusing to enter Islam. 

    Ibn Katheer said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) was with his mother Aaminah bint Wahb, then 
    when she died, his grandfather ‘Abd al-Muttalib took care of him. He used to 
    sit on his cushion and ‘Abd al-Muttaalib would not eat any food without 
    saying “Bring me my son” and he would be brought to him. When ‘Abd 
    al-Muttalib was on his deathbed, he told Abu Taalib to take care of the 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Ibn 
    Ishaaq said: When the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) reached the age of eight years, his grandfather ‘Abd 
    al-Muttalib ibn Haashim died. After his grandfather, the Messenger of Allaah 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stayed with his paternal 
    uncle Abu Taalib, in accordance with the last wishes of ‘Abd al-Muttalib, 
    and because he was the full-brother of (the Prophet’s) father ‘Abd-Allaah – 
    their mother was Faatimah bint ‘Amr ibn ‘Imraan ibn Makhzoom. So Abu Taalib 
    was the one who looked after the affairs of the Messenger of Allaah  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Abu Taalib had no wealth, but 
    he loved him deeply, more than he loved his own children; he would not sleep 
    unless he was his side, and when he went out he would go out with him, and 
    he used to keep the best food for him.

20243,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20243,How should we greet scholars and leaders?,Is it okay to kiss the hands of Muslim world leaders? Or to bow before them in respect? And what is the correct way to greet them. We think that it is the embrace and handshake for the men.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    The correct way to greet scholars is to greet them with 
    salaam and shake their hand. Many ahaadeeth have been narrated concerning 
    the virtue of these actions. It is also permissible to kiss their heads or 
    hands sometimes, but that should not be taken as a habit or custom, 
    especially if it is done instead of shaking hands. 

    With regard to embracing, that is permissible when someone 
    comes from a journey or after a long absence, or to express one's deep love 
    for the sake of Allaah and so on. 

    Muslim (54) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased 
    with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) said: “By the One in Whose hand is my soul, you will not enter 
    Paradise until you believe, and you will not believe until you love one 
    another. Shall I not tell you something which, if you do it, you will love 
    one another? Spread the greeting of salaam amongst yourselves.” 

    And it was narrated that Qataadah said: I said to Anas: Did 
    the companions of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) shake hands with one another? He said: Yes. Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 
    5908. 

    And it was narrated that Anas said: When the companions of 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) met they would 
    shake hands with one another, and if they came from a journey they would 
    embrace one another. 

    Narrated by al-Tabaraani in al-Awsat (1/37); classed 
    as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 2647. 

    It was narrated from ‘Awn ibn Abi Juhayfah that his father 
    said: When Ja’far came after he had migrated to Abyssinia, the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) embraced him and kissed him 
    between the eyes. 

    Narrated by al-Tabaraani in al-Kabeer (2/108); there 
    are many corroborating reports which were mentioned by al-Haafiz ibn Hajar 
    in al-Talkhees al-Habeer, 4/96/ it was classed as saheeh by Shaykh 
    al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 2657. 

    It was narrated that Usaamah ibn Shareek said: We stood up 
    for the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and kissed 
    his hand. 

    Narrated by Abu Bakr ibn al-Muqqari in Juz’ Taqbeel al-Yad, 
    p. 58. Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said: Its isnaad is qawiy. Fath al-Baari, 
    11/56 

    Shaykh Muhammad Naasir al-Deen al-Albaani said: 

    I say: This indicates that the Sahaabah differentiated 
    between whether a person was present or travelling in the manner in which 
    they greeted him. In the first case (when a person was a resident) they 
    shook hands, and in the second case (when a person had come from travelling) 
    they embraced him. Hence I used to avoid embracing when not travelling. In 
    particular, in the first volume of al-Silsilah (no. 160) I narrated a 
    hadeeth in which the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) forbade bowing, embracing and kissing. Then when I prepared that volume 
    for reprinting, I re-examined this hadeeth and noticed that the word 
    embracing is not mentioned in the corroborating reports on the basis of 
    which I had classed the hadeeth as qawiy, so I took it out, as will be seen 
    in the new edition in sha Allaah which will be published shortly, praise be 
    to Allaah. 

    When I realized that it was weak, I felt comfortable about 
    taking it out, praise be to Allaah. In particular I saw that Ibn al-Teehaan 
    al-Ansaari embraced the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him), according to the hadeeth that speaks of the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) coming out to the house of Ibn al-Teehaan 
    (may Allaah be pleased with him), which is narrated in al-Shamaa’il 
    al-Muhammadiyyah (no. 113, p. 79 – Mukhtasar al-Shamaa’il). But 
    here it indicates that this is permissible sometimes, not that it is to be 
    done always, as if it were a Sunnah, and as is the case with shaking hands, 
    so attention should be paid to that. 

    I noted that Imam al-Baghawi spoke about the differentiation 
    mentioned above, and I think it will be very useful to quote him here. He 
    (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in Sharh al-Sunnah (12/293), 
    after mentioning the hadeeth of Ja’far and others which may appear to be 
    contradictions: 

    With regard to the kind of embracing and kissing that is 
    makrooh, it is that which is done by way of flattery and veneration when a 
    person is not travelling. The kind that is permitted is that which is done 
    when bidding farewell and when a person returns from a journey, and when 
    meeting someone after not seeing him for a long time and when there is 
    intense love for the sake of Allaah. What is to be kissed is not the mouth 
    but rather the hand, head and forehead. 

    It is makrooh to do that when one is not travelling as far as 
    I can see, because one meets people frequently and not everyone deserves 
    that. If a man does that to some people and not to others, those whom he 
    ignores will be upset by that and will think that he is falling short and 
    neglecting their rights. The best greeting is the handshake. End quote. 

    It should be noted that some of the imams, such as Abu 
    Haneefah and his companion Muhammad, are of the view that embracing is 
    makrooh; al-Tahhaawi narrated this from them, which is opposite to the view 
    of Abu Yoosuf. 

    Imam Maalik also regarded it as makrooh. In al-Adaab 
    al-Shar’iyyah (2/278) it says: 

    Maalik regarded it as makrooh to embrace one who comes from a 
    journey and said it is a bid’ah (innovation). He explained the fact that the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did that to Ja’far 
    when he came as being a unique case. Sufyaan said to him: You cannot regard 
    it as a unique case without evidence and Maalik fell silent. Al-Qaadi said: 
    The fact that he fell silent indicates that he accepted what Sufyaan said 
    and agreed with him. This is the correct view, so long as there is no 
    evidence that this is a unique case. 

    We have referred above to the view of Imam al-Baghawi who 
    said that there should be no kissing on the mouth. Shaykh Ibn Muflih 
    explained the reason for that in al-Adaab al-Shar’iyyah (2/275) where 
    he said: 

    It is makrooh to kiss on the mouth, because it is rarely done 
    out of respect. 

    And it seems to me that there is another reason, which is 
    that it is not narrated that the salaf did that; if it were good they would 
    have done it before us. How well the poet spoke when he said: 

    All goodness is in following those who came before and all 
    evil is in the innovations of those who came later. 

    Al-Silsilah al-Saheeh, vol. 6, 
    section 1 (305-307). 

    And the Shaykh also said: 

    With regard to kissing the hand, there are many ahaadeeth and 
    reports concerning that, which when taken together indicate that this is 
    proven from the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him). We think that it is permissible to kiss the hand of the scholar 
    if the following conditions are met: 

    1.That it does not become a 
    custom to such an extent that the scholar habitually stretches out his hand 
    to his students and they habitually seek blessing by kissing his hand, 
    because although the hand of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) was kissed, that happened rarely, and such matters cannot be 
    taken as a Sunnah to be done regularly, as is well known from the basic 
    principles of fiqh.

    2.That should not make the 
    scholar feel arrogant towards others or admire himself, as happens among 
    many shaykhs nowadays.

    3.That should not lead to 
    abandoning any well known Sunnah, such as shaking hands, which is prescribed 
    because of the words and actions of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) and is a shar’i means of the sins of those who shake 
    hands being erased, as is narrated in more than one hadeeth. It is not 
    permissible to supercede it or ignore it for another habit which, at best, 
    is permissible.

    Al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 1/302. 

    Secondly: 

    With regard to bowing, that is not permissible when meeting 
    anyone, whether he is a scholar or not. 

    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: 

    With regard to bowing when meeting, it is forbidden as it is 
    narrated in al-Tirmidhi that they asked the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) about a man who meets his brother and bows 
    to him. He said: “No, because it is not permissible to bow or prostrate to 
    anyone except Allaah, may He be glorified. That may have been done by way of 
    greeting under a law other than ours, as in the story of Yoosuf – “…and 
    they fell down before him prostrate. And he said: “O my father! This is the 
    interpretation of my dream aforetime!”  [Yoosuf 12:100].  

    But in our sharee’ah it is not permissible to prostrate to 
    anyone except Allaah. Indeed it is forbidden to stand as the Persians used 
    to stand for one another – so what about bowing and prostrating? And a 
    slight bow (as opposed to the full bow as in prayer) is also included in 
    this prohibition. 

    Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 1/377 

    And he said: 

    With regard to lowering one's head before the senior shaykhs 
    or kissing the ground etc, these are matters concerning which there is no 
    dispute among the imams that they are haraam. Indeed, simply bowing to 
    anyone other than Allaah is forbidden. In al-Musnad and elsewhere it 
    is narrated that when Mu’aadh ibn Jabal (may Allaah be pleased with him) 
    came back from Syria he prostrated to the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) and he said: “What is this, O Mu’aadh?” he said: “O 
    Messenger of Allaah, I saw them in Syria prostrating to their bishops and 
    patriarchs, and they narrated that from their Prophets.” He said, “They are 
    lying, O Mu’aadh. If I were to command anyone to prostrate to anyone else I 
    would have told the women to prostrate to their husbands because of the 
    greatness of their rights over them. O Mu’aadh, do you think that if you 
    pass by my grave you will prostrate?” He said, “No.” He said: “Do not do 
    that.” 

    In conclusion, standing, sitting, bowing and prostrating are 
    all due to the One God, the Creator of the heavens and the earth. Whatever 
    is a right only for Allaah, no one else can have a share in it, such as 
    swearing by anyone other than Allaah etc. 

    Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 27/92, 93. 

    The scholars of the Standing Committee said:  

    It is not permissible to bow when greeting or to take off 
    one's shoes for someone. 

    And they said: 

    It is not permissible to bow in greeting to a Muslim or to a 
    kaafir, not with the upper part of the body or with the head, because bowing 
    is an act of worship and worship can only be done for Allaah alone.

    Since the husband of a maternal or paternal aunt is not 
    mentioned in this verse, the ruling is that the general principle of 
    observing hijab in front of him applies in this case, unless this woman (the 
    aunt) had breastfed her brother’s child, in which case her husband would be 
    regarded as a father to her through radaa’ah (breastfeeding), in which case 
    he would be a mahram for her. So if you did not breastfeed this niece, then 
    she has to observe hijaab in front of your husband, in obedience to the 
    command of Allaah, which is best for both parties. That is purer for the 
    hearts and furthest removed from fitnah (temptation). We ask Allaah to 
    reward you and your husband with good for taking care of this girl and

If you love to play, but your father tells you not to play at certain times because of your studies, what would you do? If you truly love your father, you will do as he asks, even though you love to play. 
If you are afraid that your father will punish you, and you know that he punishes the one who does not listen to what he says, then you will stop playing and go study. 
If you expect a gift or a reward from your father when you study or do well, then you will stop yourself playing sometimes, and you will put up with the trouble of studying, because of the reward you hope to earn.

“And whatever of blessings and good things you have, it is from Allah” [Al-Nahl 16:53]
The reward that Allah has prepared for those who obey Him is the greatest of rewards: Paradise. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allah has promised those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah — Islamic Monotheism) and do deeds of righteousness, that for them there is forgiveness and a great reward (i.e. Paradise)” [Al-Maa'idah 5:9]
The punishment that He has prepared for those who disobey Him is the worst of punishments. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And whosoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad), and transgresses His limits, He will cast him into the Fire, to abide therein; and he shall have a disgraceful torment” [Al-Nisa’ 4:14]
Obeying Allah can only be achieved by obeying His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“He who obeys the Messenger (Muhammad), has indeed obeyed Allah, but he who turns away, then we have not sent you (O Muhammad) as a watcher over them” [Al-Nisa’ 4:80]
So you can only enter Paradise by obeying the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).

One of them said to the other: ‘Let us tell him an parable.’ He said: ‘Let your ears hear and let your heart understand. The likeness of you and your ummah is that of a king who took some land and built a house on it, then he placed a table therein and sent a messenger inviting the people to come and eat. Some of them responded to the messenger and others did not. Allah is the king, the land is Islam, the house is Paradise, and you, O Muhammad, are a messenger. Whoever responds to you enters Islam, and whoever enters Islam will enter Paradise, and whoever enters Paradise will eat what is therein.’”  See al-Silsilah al-Saheehah by al-Albani, 3595. 
Now you know why we have to love the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and respect him the most. It is because he is the one who showed us the path to Paradise. We cannot enter Paradise unless we follow him (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and follow his Sunnah. Paradise is the greatest thing that the Muslim can hope for and strive for. 
Now I shall tell you of the practical way of expressing this love and obedience:

Why did the Prophet pray with shoes on?


Praying in shoes inside mosques","Praise be to Allah.Praying with shoes on
One of the conditions which must be met before starting to pray is to make sure that one's body and clothes and the place in which the Muslim is going to pray are all clean and free of impurities.
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to pray wearing his shoes . Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) was asked, “Did the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) pray wearing shoes?” He said, “Yes.” (al-Bukhari, 386; Muslim, 555). 
This is to be understood as meaning, so long as there is no impurity on the shoes . If there is any impurity on them, then it is not permissible to pray in them.
If a person forgets and prays wearing shoes when there is some impurity on them, then he has to take them off when he finds out or remembers. 
Abu Sa’id al-Khudri said: “While the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was leading his Companions in prayer, he took off his shoes and placed them to his left. When the people saw that, they took off their shoes too. When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) finished his prayer, he asked, ‘What made you take off your shoes?’ They said, ‘We saw you take off your shoes, so we took ours off too.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ‘Jibril (peace be upon him) came to me and told me that there was something dirty on them.’ When any one of you comes to the mosque, let him look and if he sees anything dirty on his shoes, let him wipe them and then pray in them.” (Abu Dawud, 650; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud, 605) 
Why did the Prophet pray with shoes on?
One of the reasons why the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed wearing shoes is to be found in the hadith, “Be different from the Jews, who do not pray in their shoes or in their leather slippers (khufuf).” (Abu Dawud, 652; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud, 607)  That is regarded as mustahabb for the purpose of differing from non-Muslims, as stated above. 
Praying in shoes inside mosques
This has to do with the kind of shoes and with the mosque at that time. However if the mosque is furnished with carpeting , then the mosque should be kept clean of shoes, and no one should enter wearing shoes lest the place be made dirty. (Fatawa Samahat al-Shaykh ‘Abd-Allah ibn Humayd, p. 81)
Moreover the furnishings of the mosque are a waqf which should not be damaged or destroyed, and if dirt gets onto the carpets it will offend those who pray and prostrate on them. Hence no one should enter wearing shoes and walk on the carpets in the mosque in shoes, lest he damage them or make them dirty. 
The one who is keen to follow this Sunnah can apply it when praying at home, or when praying in places where there are no furnishings or carpets, such as parks, beaches and out of doors, etc. If this action confuses some of those who are unaware of the Sunnah, he should explain to them that it is Sunnah before he does it, so that they will not find that odd.

I can feel Allah is guiding me in ways I don’t understand. I don’t feel guilty, I just feel why am I doing this. I have asked a few Muslim people I work with and even a person I met online to teach me to pray properly and help me in other ways but because I am Australian they don’t feel I am being serious about being Muslim so they have been reluctant I am not a good person I think but I am much better than I have been and with His help and guidance I know I will succeed.

First and last, and thanks be to Him always. He blesses whomsoever He wills with guidance, and deprives whomsoever He wills of happiness. He saves His slave from misguidance and supports His close friends until the Hour begins. 
My dear Muslim brother, congratulations on your being blessed with guidance. We ask Allah to make you steadfast until death. 
It was a great achievement when you decided to embrace Islam and give up the misguidance in which you had grown up and the shirk [association of others with Allaah] which is forbidden. We welcome you as a new brother in Islam and we welcome you as a visitor to this site. 
Life is about tests and trials
First of all, we would remind you that in this world man passes through great tests and trials, which require him to be patient and steadfast, and to stand firm until death.  
“O man! Verily, you are returning towards your Lord  with your deeds and actions (good or bad), a sure returning, and you will meet (the results of your deeds which you did).” [al-Inshiqaq 84:6 – interpretation of the meaning]
One of the trials with which Allah tests His slaves is the enjoining of obligations and duties such as prayer, fasting, zakah (poor due), Hajj (pilgrimage) and other acts of worship, and the things that He forbids them to do such as lying, cheating, adultery, homosexuality and all other forbidden things, so as to see the sincere believer who obeys the commands of Allah, so that He may admit him to Paradise, and the liar and hypocrite who does not obey Allah, so that He may send him to Hell. 
Try to do your best to learn what Allah commands, and do it, and what He forbids, and avoid it. 
There are many commands, and many prohibitions, and it is impossible to list them or explain them all in one place. But we refer you to what is mentioned in this site of ours of questions that deal with the teachings of Islam, so you can look at it and read what it says, and may Allah benefit you thereby. 
Praying in Arabic is too difficult, but you have to pray
With regard to what you mention in your question about having to learn Arabic, this is true, but you do not have to learn the whole language, rather just what you need for religious purposes. Please see question no. 6524 . 
The fact that you do not know Arabic does not justify your not praying, because you can learn what you need for prayer in a short period of time, and until you learn it you should still continue to pray regularly on time, and pray according to what you are able to do. “Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope.” [al-Baqarah 2:286]  
With regard to how to pray, you will find the answer to that on this site, under Questions no. 13340 . Please see also 8580 , 2427  . 
Introduce yourself to an Islamic Center
Finally we advise you to look for an Islamic Centre in your city, and to keep company with Muslims who practice their religion. Do not forget to read trustworthy websites, and try to benefit from them as much as you can. We will also be happy to help you and others like you who are looking for things that will benefit them, and we will offer whatever advice we can, so keep in touch with us.

20271,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20271,If there are two who came late to the prayer can one of them be an imam and lead the other?,"We have a musallah at our compagny where we perform daily prayer and Friday prayer.

I realized the following : Some times some brothers when they came late and before the Imam has finished, they join the jamaa prayer behind the Imam and after the imam has finished the prayer, they stand up to continue the prayer ( normal). It happens that one brother decide to follow another one ( late ) in his left who becomes a new Imam !  : Are situation allowed ? Is there some thing in the Coran or Sunna that justify practice such in the above situation ?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.This is the issue of one who came late to the 
    prayer being joined by another who also came late. There is a difference of opinion among the scholars as to whether this is allowed or not. 
    Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was of the view that it is permitted. There follows the text of his comments:
 “If two people who came late to the prayer 
    enter (the mosque), and one says to the other, ‘When the imam says the salaam, I will be your imam,’ and the other says, “O.k.,’ then when the 
    imam says the salaam, one of the two becomes the imam for the other. He moves from following an imam to leading the prayer, and the other moves 
    from following one imam to following another. 
Some of the scholars said that this is 
    permissible, and that there is nothing wrong with two who missed part of the prayer agreeing that one of them will be the imam for the other. They 
    said that moving from one imam to another is something that is proven in the Sunnah, as in the case of Abu Bakr and the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him), when Abu Bakr led the people in prayer when the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was 
    ill, then the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came out during the prayer. When Abu Bakr saw him, he stepped back to let 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) come forward, and the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    completed the prayer. Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 687; Muslim 418. In this story two transfers took place: 
1 – Abu Bakr moved from being the imam to 
    following another imam
2 – The Sahaabah moved from following Abu 
    Bakr to following the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
And it was said that this is not permissible, 
    because this involves moving from one imam to another, and moving from following an imam to leading the prayer with no excuse, and it is not 
    possible to move from a lower position to a higher one, because the person who is leading the prayer is in a higher position than the one who is 
    following the imam. 
They said: And this was not known at the time 
    of the salaf. The Sahaabah, if they missed a part of the prayer, they did not agree that one of them would step forward and act as an imam for the 
    others. If this was something good they would have done it before us. 
But those who say that it is permissible do not say that it is required of those who come late 
    to the prayer to agree that one of them will be the imam. Rather they say that if this is done, it is permissible. There is a difference between 
    saying that it is permissible and saying that it is mustahabb and prescribed in Islam. We do not say that it is prescribed and we do not recommend 
    that if people come late to the prayer, one of them should say, “I will be your imam.” But if they do that, then we do not say, “Your prayer is 
    invalid.” This is the more correct opinion, i.e., that it is permissible, but we should not do it, because it was not known among the salaf, and 
    if something was not known among the salaf, it is better not to do it, because we know that they more keen than us to do what is good, and if 
    something were good they would have done it before us.

20274,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/20274,He has repented from a haraam relationship; should he marry his former girlfriend if she becomes Muslim?,"I have been a muslim all my life and I have done some terrible things in my that has cause some great distress in my life. I have been with a Christian girl for 2 years now but recently seperated from her because I have came closer to islam. She understands that we should not be together right now. I know that I wasn't a good muslim before but now I want to do anything to be for given for what I did. We have done some sexual things like fondling, manual pleasure, and oral sex on one occasion. I know that these are grievous things and I beg Allah for forgiveness and regret what I have done.  This was a result in my ignorance and I have repented. I now pray 5 times a day, go to the mosc, and read Quran. I never want to go back to the bad things that I have done. I feel that I should marry a muslima from Egypt and change my life but I also feel that I should at least show the Christian girl islam in hopes that she will convert.  My questions are: Should I marry her if she converts? Or should I find a muslima and start a new life? Will I be forgiven for what I have done?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    Feelings of sin and regret for what one has done are signs of 
    divine care for the one who committed the sin and serve to motivate him to 
    follow the right path after having gone astray. We do not want to give the 
    impression that what you have done is something insignificant, rather you 
    should realize that what you have done angers your Lord and that it is a 
    major sin. But we want to show you the path of repentance and let you know 
    that even though Allaah is not harmed by your sin and has no need of your 
    repentance, still He has helped you to repent and He rejoices at your 
    repentance. 

    You have to give up your previous sin, and sincerely regret 
    what you have done, and resolve firmly never to go back to this sin. 

    You should never despair of the mercy of Allaah, for Allaah 
    forgives all sins. All you have to do is to repent sincerely and after that 
    you will see that which will bring you joy; and seek the pleasure of Allaah.

    See also: 624,
    13990,
    34905 and
    22912 

    Secondly: 

    You also have to end your relationship with this woman lest 
    you go back to sinning. The basic principle for the repentant Muslim is that 
    he should keep away from all environments in which he used to disobey Allaah 
    and he must avoid and shun all the means that could lead him to fall into 
    sin. 

    So we do not think that you should get back in touch with 
    this woman, even with the intention of calling her to Islam. You have to 
    save yourself first. Who can guarantee that if you go back to sin – Allaah 
    forbid – you will be enabled to repent again? 

    You could ask some trustworthy Muslim women to contact her 
    and call her to Islam. We do not think that you should be the one to do 
    that. 

    Thirdly: 

    We do not think that it is permissible for you to marry her 
    as she is at present, not because she is a Christian, but because she is not 
    chaste – according to what you say. Allaah has permitted us to marry women 
    from the people of the Book, but that is subject to the condition that they 
    be chaste, i.e., they do not commit zina or have boyfriends. 

    See 22303 and
    2527. 

    What we advise you to do is to marry a religiously-committed 
    Muslim woman who will help to protect your religious commitment and help you 
    to do good and to obey Allaah. This is the way to success.

I would like to know that if one pays proper zakah on the extra houses then will he still have them as a burden on his back on the Day of Judgement?,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    We do not know of this hadeeth to which you 
    refer. The one who it is proven will carry things on his back on the Day of 
    Resurrection is the one who took things unlawfully from others in this 
    world, whether by force or by stealth, or stealing booty from the 
    battlefield before the spoils of war were distributed. 

    It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah 
    be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon 
    him) stood before us and spoke about war booty and how serious the matter 
    is. He said, 

    “I should not like to see anyone amongst you 
    on the Day of Resurrection, carrying on his neck a sheep that will be 
    bleating, or carrying on his neck a horse that will be neighing, saying: ‘O 
    Messenger of Allah! Help me!’ and I will reply, ‘I cannot do anything for 
    you, for I have conveyed Allah's Message to you.’ Nor should I like to see a 
    man carrying on his neck, a camel that will be grunting, saying: ‘O 
    Messenger of Allah! Help me!’ and I will reply, ‘I cannot do anything for 
    you, for I have conveyed Allah's Message to you.’  Or one carrying on his 
    neck gold and silver, saying: ‘O Messenger of Allah! Help me!’ and I will 
    reply, ‘I cannot do anything for you, for I have conveyed Allah's Message to 
    you.’ Or one carrying clothes that will be fluttering, saying: ‘O Messenger 
    of Allah! Help me!’ and I will reply, ‘I cannot do anything for you, for I 
    have conveyed Allah's Message to you.’” 

    Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2908; Muslim, 1831

    Secondly: 

    With regard to a Muslim building a house 
    that is bigger than he and his family need, Ibn Hazm said: 

    (The scholars) are agreed that it is 
    obligatory for a man to build that which will shelter him and his family 
    from prying eyes and from cold, heat and rain, or to buy a house or dwelling 
    that will cover him in the manner mentioned. And they agreed that it is 
    permissible to seek to earn more money and build a more spacious house so 
    long as this is done by halal (lawful) means and he fulfils all his duties 
    towards Allah, but they differed as to whether this is makrooh (disliked) or 
    not.” 

    Maratib al-Ijma’, 
    p. 155 

    What the Muslim should do is not to go to 
    excess in matters of this world, and to limit himself to what he needs, 
    based on the general meaning of the verses which forbid extravagance, such 
    as the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And those who, when they spend, are neither 
    extravagant nor niggardly, but hold a medium (way) between those 
    (extremes).”

    [al-Furqan 25:67]

    Al-Tirmidhi (4283) narrated from Khabbab 
    (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and 
    blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “A person will be rewarded for all his 
    spending except what he spends on building.” Classed as saheeh (authentic) 
    by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. Also narrated by al-Bukhari 
    (5672) from Khabbab (may Allah be pleased with him). Ibn Hajar said: This is 
    understood as referring to what exceeds one’s requirements. 

    This is also indicated by the way the 
    Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was: he rose above 
    preoccupation with this world, and warned his ummah (followers) against 
    indulging in worldly pleasures, as he said in the hadeeth: “By Allah, I do 
    not fear poverty for you but I fear prosperity in this world as those who 
    came before you became prosperous, and you start to compete with one another 
    in worldly gains, as they did, then you will be destroyed as they were.” 

    Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3158; Muslim, 2961. 

    Thirdly: 

    There is no zakah due on the houses that a 
    Muslim builds for his family or children, even if their value rises. And 
    houses that he builds to rent out are not subject to zakah themselves, 
    rather zakah is due on the rent if it reaches the nisab (minimum amount 
    which has to be possessed for zakah to be due) and one whole hijri year has 
    passed. Houses that he builds in order to sell are subject to zakah, because 
    they are a kind of trade goods, so after one year has passed he should 
    calculate their value and pay zakah on them, one-quarter of one-tenth of the 
    total value.

This is a very important topic that many do not have an adequate understanding of.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: 
What is the ruling on giving treatment before sickness occurs, such as vaccinations? 
He replied: 
There is nothing wrong with giving treatment if there is the fear that the disease may occur because of the presence of an epidemic or other factors which may cause disease. There is nothing wrong with giving medicine to ward off the feared disease, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, according to the saheeh hadeeth, “Whoever eats seven dates of Madeenah in the morning will not be harmed by witchcraft or poison.” This is a kind of warding off a problem before it happens. So if there is the fear of sickness and a person is vaccinated against an infection that is present in the land or elsewhere, there is nothing wrong with that, because it is a kind of protection. But it is not permissible to wear or hang up amulets etc against sickness, the jinn or the evil eye, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade that, and explained that this is a kind of minor shirk [associating others in worship with Allaah], so it must be avoided. 
Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 6/21 
With regard to the harm suffered by those who are given some vaccinations, namely a short-lived fever or other side-efects, these drawbacks may be overlooked when compared with the great harm that is warded off, namely the diseases that may kill or cause great harm to a person’s health. 
This is similar to the case of circumcising boys by cutting off a piece of skin and the intense pain that is caused to the infant; this is outweighed by the great benefits that are served by this action, serving the religious interest of purity (tahaarah) and numerous worldly benefits. 
The general shar’i principle with regard to this matter is that the lesser of two evils may be done in order to ward off the greater evil, if it is necessary to do one of them. Al-Ashbaah wa’l-Nazaa’ir by al-Subki, 1/45. 
But if it is medically proven that a specific vaccine causes harm to the body or that its harmful effects outweigh its effects of warding off disease, then it is not permissible to use it in that case, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “There should be neither harm nor reciprocating harm.”

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Charity given to a poor person is charity, but charity given to a relative is two things, charity and upholding the ties of kinship.” 
Narrated by al-Nasaa’i, 2581; al-Tirmidhi, 658; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Nasaa’i, 2420. 
But if these relatives are among those on whom you are obliged to spend, but you give them your zakah so that you can save money, then that is not permissible. 
But if your wealth is not sufficient to spend on them, then there is nothing wrong with giving them some of your zakah. Similarly, if they are in debt and you pay off their debts from your zakah, there is nothing wrong with your doing that, because a person is not obliged to pay off his relative’s debt, so if he pays it off from his zakah then that is fine. Even if it is your son or your father who owes a debt to someone and cannot pay it off, it is permissible for you to pay it off from your zakah.

I know hurting the body on purpose is haram, but if tattooing doesn’t hurt the body, is it still haram? Can you please clear all that for me?","Tattoos are haram in all forms, whether they cause pain or not. Tattooing involves changing the creation of Allah. Prophet Muhammad cursed the one who does tattoos and the one for whom that is done.","Are tattoos haram?


Why are tattoos haram?","Praise be to Allah.Are tattoos haram?
Tattooing , in which the skin is pierced with a needle and a blue or other coloured dye is injected, is haraam in all forms, whether it causes pain or not. This is because it involves changing the creation of Allah, and because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed the one who does tattoos and the one for whom that is done. 
‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “May Allah curse the women who do tattoos and those for whom tattoos are done, those who pluck their eyebrows and those who file their teeth for the purpose of beautification and alter the creation of Allah.” (Al-Bukhari, al-Libas, 5587; Muslim, al-Libas, 5538) 
Why are tattoos haram?
With regard to all these matters, the ahaadeeth testify that the one who does them is cursed and that they are major sins. There is some difference of scholarly opinion as to the reason why tattoos are forbidden. It was said that it is because they are a form of deception, and it was said that it is because it is a way of changing the creation of Allah, as Ibn Mas’ood said – which is more correct and also includes the first meaning. 
It was also suggested that what is forbidden is only that which is permanent, because that is changing the creation of Allah; as for that which is not permanent, such as kohl , which is used for adornment by women, that is permitted by the scholars. (Tafseer al-Qurtubi, 5/393) 
So if what is referred to in the question is that which is not permanent, then it is not a tattoo as such and does not change the creation of Allah.

    prescribed for the intelligent person to ask questions, seek benefits and look for that which will increase his longing for Paradise and make him 
    strive harder to reach it. Some of the Companions of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) asked him similar questions to 
    this. 
It was narrated from Sulaymaan ibn Buraydah 
    from his father that a man asked the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “O Messenger of Allaah, are there horses in 
    Paradise?” He said, “If Allaah admits you to Paradise, any time you wish to be carried on a horse of red rubies that will fly with you wherever 
    you want in Paradise, you will do that.” Another man asked him, “O Messenger of Allaah, will there be camels in Paradise?” and he did not say to 
    him something like he said to his companion. He said, “If Allaah admits you to Paradise, you will have there whatever your heart desires.” 
Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2543; this hadeeth 
    was classed as hasan by Shaykh al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Targheeb, 3/522. 
With regard to the specific topic of your 
    question, about a person who loves flying and airplanes, there are many saheeh ahaadeeth which speak of a similar joy.  
It was proven that the souls of the martyrs 
    are in the crops of birds in Paradise, flying wherever they wish. Narrated by Muslim, 2410. 
It was proven that Ja’far ibn Abi Taalib (may 
    Allaah be pleased with him) flies in Paradise with two wings, as an honour from Allaah and to replace his arms which were cut off in the battle of 
    Mu’tah. 
It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “I saw Ja’far flying in Paradise with the angels.” 
Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3763; classed as 
    saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 3465. 
It was narrated from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) that he used to say salaam to 
    Ibn Ja’far and say, “Peace be upon you, O son of the one with two wings.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3506. 
It seems that for a person to fly by himself 
    is more exciting for most people than flying by means of something else. There are many verses and ahaadeeth which say that people in Paradise 
    will have whatever their hearts desire and more. 
As it says in the verse (interpretation of 
    the meaning): 
“Trays of gold and cups will be passed 
    round them; (there will be) therein all that inner-selves could desire, and all that eyes could delight in and you will abide therein forever”
[al-Zukhruf 43:71]
Al-Sa’di said in his commentary on this 
    verse: 
“… all that inner-selves could desire…” 
    – this phrase is comprehensive and includes every kind of blessing, joy, delight and pleasure, in the most perfect and best sense. 
And Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 
“‘Adn (Eden) Paradise (Gardens of 
    Eternity) which they will enter, under which rivers flow, they will have therein all that they wish. Thus Allaah rewards the Muttaqoon (the 
    pious)”
[al-Nahl 16:31]
The Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah says: ‘I have prepared for My righteous slaves that which no eye has seen, no ear has heard and it has never 
    crossed the mind of man.’ Recite if you wish: ‘No person knows what is kept hidden for them of joy as a reward for what 
    they used to do’ [al-Sajdah 32:17 – interpretation of the meaning].” 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3072; Muslim, 2824 
A person should be certain of the absolute 
    perfection of Paradise and of its people’s happiness. 
With regard to being certain that there will 
    be airplanes and airports and other things for which no proof is narrated in the texts, this is the matter of knowledge of the Unseen, which needs 
    evidence. 
We say as the Messenger  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If Allaah admits you to Paradise you will have therein whatever your heart desires and whatever will 
    delight you.” 
We ask Allaah to help us and you to do that 
    which will lead us to everlasting delight in Paradise. 
And Allaah knows best.",Islam Q&A
