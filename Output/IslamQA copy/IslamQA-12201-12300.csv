          to accept the teachings of Islam, and act upon them. When he hears of 
          some word or deed which is based on evidence (daleel) from the Qur’aan 
          or Sunnah, then he has to accept it and give it priority over anything 
          else. He should check what people say against the evidence of sharee’ah, 
          and only accept those views which are in accordance with that evidence. 
          It is known that Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Abd Al-Wahhaab (may Allaah have 
          mercy on him) called people to Tawheed and he wrote his famous book 
          on that topic which is called Kitaab al-Tawheed. In this book 
          he limited himself to quoting only the clear evidence from the verses 
          of the Qur’aan and the saheeh ahaadeeth of the Prophet  
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Commentaries on this book 
          were written by his grandson ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Hasan and other scholars. 
          Hence none of his opponents can refute this book or claim that his evidence 
          is false. They fabricated lies and believed them, so they believed that 
          he was misguided. They gave the same label to the scholars of the Muslims 
          such as Shaykh Ibn Baaz and Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy 
          on them both). It is known that the shaykhs whom we have mentioned did 
          not deviate from  the correct view with regard to beliefs and actions; 
          they followed the same path as the Sahaabah and Taabi’een, the four 
          imaams, the authors of the Six Books and others. Those who do not acknowledge 
          them do that either out of ignorance, blind imitation of others, jealousy, 
          stubbornness or following their own whims and desires, or adherence 
          to traditions, bid’ah (innovation) and evil actions that go against 
          the evidence (of sharee’ah).  Earlier and later scholars have proven 
          such people to be wrong. So we must follow the evidence and give it 
          priority over the views of all people.",Shaykh Ibn Jibreen

How to get rid of jealousy in Islam","Praise be to Allah.Love for your brother what you love for yourself
What every Muslim is obliged to do, as you mentioned, is to love for his brother what he loves for himself of good things, and to hate for his brother what he hates for himself of bad things. This does not mean that he cannot like for himself what he likes for others. If he sees that his brother has something that he does not, and he wishes that he had it too, this is ghibtah (envy that is free from malice); if he wishes that the blessing would be taken away from them, this is called hasad (destructive jealousy). 
The Muslim needs to strive against his own self (jihad al-nafs) so that his heart will be free of jealousy towards his Muslim brothers. If he sincerely loves his brothers, most of these problems from which he is suffering will disappear. When the Muslim realizes how great his virtue and status will be when he loves his brothers and loves good things for them, and when he knows how great his reward will be if he treats them well, this will motivate him to treat them well in all ways, and to strive to benefit his brothers instead of being preoccupied with jealous thoughts of what they have and he doesn’t. (Shaykh Muhammad al-Duwaysh) 
You have to think long and hard about the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“That is the Grace of Allah which He bestows on whom He wills.” [al-Maidah 5:54] 
“It is We Who portion out between them their livelihood in this world, and We raised some of them above others in ranks, so that some may employ others in their work.” [al-Zukhruf 43:32] 
Dangers of the evil eye
Hasad (destructive jealousy ) causes a great deal of harm in this world and in the Hereafter. Al-Tirmidhi narrated from al-Zubayr ibn al-'Awwam that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:
“There has come to you the disease of the nations before you, jealousy and hatred. This is the ‘shaver’ (destroyer); I do not say that it shaves hair, but that it shaves  (destroys) faith. By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, you will not enter Paradise until you believe, and you will not believe until you love one another. Shall I not tell you of that which will strengthen love between you? Spread (the greeting of) salam amongst yourselves.” (A hasan hadith. Jami’ al-Tirmidhi, 2434). 
Concerning the meaning of the phrase “it shaves (destroys) faith”, al-Tibi said: “i.e., hatred takes away faith like a razor takes away hair.” (Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi bi Sharh Jami’ al-Tirmidhi). 
How to get rid of jealousy in Islam
It seems, my brother, that you know the ruling and are aware of the consequences, and that you want to rid yourself of this blameworthy characteristic. Here are some solutions for you. 

Make du`a (supplication) to Allah and ask Him to rid you of this problem. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say in his du`a, “Wa’hdi qalbi wa’slul sakhimata sadri (guide my heart and remove ill will from my breast).” The phrase “guide my heart” means to the straight path, and “remove ill will from my breast” means take away all insincerity, rancour and hatred.
Ponder the meanings of the Quran and read it frequently, especially the verses which speak of hasad (destructive jealousy), because reading the Quran brings one a great deal of hasanat (reward for good deeds). Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):

“Verily, the good deeds remove the evil deeds.” [Hud 11:114]

Read the sirah (biography) of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), see how he kept away from hasad and how he loved good for others, even for his enemies. Among the useful books on sirah is Nur al-Yaqin fi Sirat Sayyid al-Mursalin.

[Translator’s note: a well-known book of sirah which is available in English is “Al-Rahiq al-Makhtum (the Sealed Nectar) – Biography of the Noble Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), by Safi-ur-Rahman al-Mubarakpuri]

Read the biographies and stories of the Companions in books such as Suwar min Hayat al-Sahabah by ‘Abd al-Rahman Rafat al-Basha)
If any such thoughts (of hasad, etc.) cross your mind, then seek refuge with Allah from the accursed Shaytan, and keep yourself busy with something that will make you forget these insinuating whispers and thoughts.
If the Shaytan manages to instil hasad in your heart, then beware lest you say or do anything which will show that hasad. Every person has his or her share of hasad.

Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: 
“Nobody is free from hasad, but the noble person hides it whilst the base person shows it.” (Amrad al-Qulub). A person will not be brought to account for whatever crosses his mind, but he will be brought to account for what he says and does. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah will forgive my ummah for their mistakes, what they forget and what they are forced to do.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2033)

If you feel that you are jealous of a specific person, then buy him a gift and shake hands with him. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Shake hands, for this will dispel rancour, and exchange gifts and love one another, for this will dispel hatred.” (Narrated by Malik in al-Muwatta, 1413). 

Hasad is the result of hatred, whose opposite is love, the way of which is giving gifts and spreading (the greeting of) salam, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “You will not enter Paradise until you believe, and you will not believe until you love one another. Shall I not tell you of that which will strengthen love between you? Spread (the greeting of) salam amongst yourselves.” (Narrated by Muslim, 81) 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in his book Amrad al-Qulub (diseases of the heart): 
“Whoever finds in himself any hasad towards another has to try to neutralize it by means of taqwa (piety, consciousness of Allah) and sabr (patience). So he should hate that (the feeling of hasad) in himself… But the one who does wrong to his brother by word or deed will be punished for that. The one who fears Allah and is patient, however, is not included among the wrongdoers, and Allah will benefit him by his taqwa.”

Many people believe that once a daughter is married, she should not spend on her parents if her brothers are able to do this instead. Do husbands have rights over their wife's wealth, not to spend themselves but rather over where the wife should spend it and if they think it should not be on her parents then she should obey this request.

If noth parents are needy, and the wife has no wealth of her own, should the husband spend on both as the wife's parents are allowed to recieve zakaah from their daughter but the husband's parents are not as it is his duty to spend on them?",,,"Praise be to Allah.Children 
          (awlaad) is a general term which includes both males and females. 
          The father has the right to dispose of his children’s wealth because 
          the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “You and your wealth 
          belong to your father.” So if the father wants to take something from 
          their wealth, he has the right to do that, so long as it will not cause 
          them any harm; it is not permissible for him to take wealth from one 
          of them and give it to another. 
If the

          she has to spend on her parents in accordance with their needs, without 
          failing to meet her own needs. The woman’s maintenance is obligatory 
          upon her husband: he must spend on that which is essential for her maintenance. 
          If the woman is working then her money is hers and hers alone, unless 
          the husband stipulates the condition that he should get the money or 
          some of it in return for her going out of the house and his missing 
          out on some of his rights. But if she has enough money she can keep

One may also look at the beauties of Islam, or explain that the sharee’ah of Islam includes everything that is good, and that sharee’ah does not enjoin anything except that which is in accordance with reason and common sense, and it does not forbid anything without explaining what is wrong with it and putting people off it.

We advise this woman to put an end to her relationship with this Christian man which has lasted for so long and he is still persisting in his kufr.

Whoever recognizes the true religion and enters it then leaves it, does not deserve to live. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Whoever changes his religion, kill him.” This is what is to be applied if he is living in a country which is ruled by sharee’ah.

12221,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12221,Is it permissible for the heirs to agree on males and females taking equal shares?,"most of the questions posted talked about a husband/father as the deceased. 
In my case, it was my mother who passed away and she left some cash & properties behind for the family. As the eldest child ( a daughter ) I was given the task to administer the distribution accordingly.  

For yr info:

i) my mother was a muslim convert. When she died, she left behind  a sister & 2 brothers ( all of whom are non-muslims)Her parents  had deceased. 

ii) There are 5 children out of my mother, 3 daughters & 2 sons, one of which is underaged ( according to my country's interpretation of Islamic Law - 18 yrs old is considered an adult. Anything below that is considered a minor )Hence the appointment of legal guardian will have to be considered.
iii) my mother's husband, the father of my 4 siblings is still alive. I came from a different father who died when I was 18 months old. My mother then remarried my stepfather and was legally his only wife until the day she died. 
How shall the wealth be divided and distributed according to Syariah Law ? 
Another question: 

I was informed that though distribution of wealth of a muslim deceased is governed by Islamic Law, if the eligible heirs agreed to distribute the said wealth according to their own arrangement, their decision will overwrite the Law itself. Is that true? 

If it does, what is the right procedure to do it? Shall the wealth be first distributed according to the Law, and later re-distributed according to the earlier agreement or can the wealth be distributed according to the heirs' arrangement straight-away?
Please explain in details because I want to make sure I take this responsibility as accorded by the Law. Anything less than that means I am answerable to Allah in life after death! May Allah Bless all of us generously!",,,"Praise be to Allah.It 
          is essential to point out something, which is that you say in your question, 
          “Syariah [Sharee’ah] Law”. This is not a good expression, so perhaps 
          you should use the phrase “Rulings of Islamic sharee’ah” instead. 
 With 
          regard to your question, it is clear from your question that the inheritance 
          is limited to your mother’s husband, yourself and your siblings, and 
          that the number of males is two and the number of females is three. 
          
 You 
          can easily divide the wealth into 12 shares, of which your mother’s 
          husband will take three shares, and the rest will be shared out among 
          you and your siblings, with each male getting the share of two females. 
          (Or you may divide the remainder into seven shares, giving two shares 
          to each male and one share to each female). 
 So 
          if the amount is 10,000  (ten thousand), and you take away 2500 
          for (your mother’s) husband, that leaves 7500 to be divided by seven. 
          So each share will be approximately 1071.5, which will be the share 
          of each female. Multiplied by 2 it makes 2143, which will be the share 
          of each male. 
 This 
          is how the inheritance is to be divided if each of the heirs wants to 
          take the share prescribed for him by Allaah. But if the heirs agree 
          amongst themselves to share the wealth equally amongst themselves, so 
          that there will be no difference between the husband and the children, 
          or between the males and females, this is permissible according to sharee’ah.

But their problem was that they did not worship Allah Alone in exclusion to others; they had other gods whom they associated in worship with Him, and which they worshipped not on the basis that they were the Lord, the Creator the Provider, but because they claimed that these were intermediaries who would intercede between them and Allah and bring them closer to Allah.

If madhiy comes out of her, she has to wash her private parts, and if wadiy comes out of her, it is subject to the same rulings as urine and she has to wash it away.
Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah.
Fatawa al-‘Ulamaa’ fi ‘Ushrat al-Nisaa’, p. 37
Shaykh al-Fawzaan answered a question concerning the ruling on the secretions which come out of women and whether they are considered to be naajis. He said: the secretions which come out of a woman’s vagina are naajis (impure); they break her wudu, and whatever parts of the body or clothing they touch become naajis, so the woman has to do istinjaa’ and wash them away, then do wudu if she wants to pray. She must also wash the places on her body or clothing that are touched by them. 
If any secretions come out of a woman because of her husband’s kisses or foreplay, she does not have to do ghusl unless that is maniy which flows at the time of climax. 
Fatawa al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah, 1/222 
Since it is clear that madhiy, wadiy and urine are all naajis, it is not permissible to swallow them because swallowing impure substances is haram. 
Al-Shaafa'i said: it is not permissible to drink or eat impure substances. (al-Umm, vol. 7, p. 221)

You did the right thing by going back to the meeqaat and entering ihraam from there.  The fact that you took off the ihraam garments does not mean that you have to offer the sacrifice, because you did not enter ihraam in the first place.

12274,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12274,Selling cameras to those who will use them for haraam pictures,My husband is selling digital cameras for a living. Some of his buyers are photographers who also do nude photography. Is is permissable for him to sell cameras to such people knowing what they will be using it for?,,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to sell anything 
          that will be used for haraam purposes, or which one thinks will most 
          likely be used for such purposes. This includes selling cameras to people 
          who will use them for haraam purposes. See the answer to question no. 
          10668 concerning the ruling on picture making. Undoubtedly selling them 
          to people who will take nude pictures is even more haraam, because Allaah 
          says (interpretation of the meaning):
“…but 
          do not help one another in sin and transgression…”
[al-Maa'idah 
          5:2]
Undoubtedly, taking such pictures with 
          them is one of the means of spreading evil and immorality in society; 
          whoever sells these cameras to them is undoubtedly helping them in spreading 
          evil, and helping others to do haraam is also haraam.
Selling 
          digital cameras (which do not produce fixed images) to those who will 
          take good pictures (beneficial pictures), such as Islamic lectures and 
          khutbahs, or permissible things such as trees, rivers and natural scenes, 
          is OK. Every Muslim businessman has to fear Allaah and be sincere towards 
          his Muslim brothers, and he should not sell anything except that which 
          is good for them and will benefit them. He should keep away from that 
          which is evil and harmful to them. The things that are halaal are sufficient 
          so there is no need for anything that is haraam. Allaah says (interpretation 
          of the meaning):
“And 
          whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way

          and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “O young men, whoever among 
          you can afford to marry, let him get married, and whoever cannot do 
          that, then he should fast, for it will be a protection for him.” (Narrated 
          by al-Bukhaari, al-Nikaah, 4677)  
Ibn Hajar said in Fath 
          al-Baari: With respect to marriage, the scholars have divided men 
          into several categories.  
The first is those who 
          have the desire to get married and who have the financial means to do 
          so and who fear for themselves. It is recommended for such a person 
          to get married according to all the scholars; according to one report 
          the Hanbalis said that it is obligatory. The well-known view of Ahmad 
          is that it is not obligatory for the one who is able and has the desire, 
          unless he fears hardship.  
Ibn Daqeeq al-‘Eid said: 
          Some of the fuqaha’ divided marriage into five rulings. They said that 
          it is obligatory in cases where there is the fear of hardship, where 
          a man is able for marriage and it is difficult to find a concubine. 
          This was narrated by al-Qurtubi from one of their scholars, namely al-Maaziri, 
          who said: it is obligatory in the case of one who cannot keep away from 
          zinaa otherwise, as stated above.  
He said: it is forbidden 
          in the case of one who will not take care of his wife with regard to 
          intercourse and spending on her, who is not able for marriage and has 
          no desire for it. Al-Safaareeni said: the poor man who cannot spend 
          on a wife and has no income, and has no desire – in this case it is 
          said that marriage is makrooh for him, because he is cannot afford it 
          and he cannot provide his wife with enjoyment to protect her, and he 
          has no need for it.  
See Ghidhaa’ al-Albaab, 
          vol. 2, p. 434  
‘Iyaad said: it is recommended 
          in the case of everyone who hopes for offspring even if he has no desire 
          for intercourse, because the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “I will be proud of 
          your great numbers.” And because of the encouragement for marriage and 
          the commands to marry. The same applies to the one who has any desire 
          for other kinds of enjoyment of women besides intercourse. But in the 
          case of one who is sterile or has no desire for women or for physical 
          pleasure, marriage is permissible for him if the woman knows and accepts 
          that.  
The hadeeth indicates that 
          masturbation is haraam, because if it were prescribed the Prophet 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would have indicated that. 
          See also Question no. 329  
If a person is patient 
          in abstaining from that which Allaah has forbidden and gives it up because

          on the Day of Resurrection, because whoever gives up something for the 
          sake of Allaah, Allaah will compensate him with something better.

1.the proposal of your guardian – who may be your father or whoever is acting in his place if he is not there, on the condition that he is of the same religion as you – by his saying, for example, “I offer my daughter in marriage to you.”
2.Acceptance on the part of the husband by saying, for example, “I accept.”
3.The contract was done in the presence of two Muslim witnesses
 – then the marriage is valid. (For more details on the conditions of marriage, see question no. 2127 and the section on conditions of marriage on this web site). If any of these conditions is missing, then the marriage is not valid, and you have to do it again. The place where the marriage contract is done does not have any effect on the validity of the marriage. 
Secondly: this question caught our attention because of your keen interest in finding out the rules of the Islamic religion concerning this matter. Perhaps this will lead you to enquire about greater realities, the most important of which is, which is the true religion? 
Permit us to ask you the following questions: 
Do you want a happy life? Do you care about finding contentment? Are you looking for the truth? Do you want a good and righteous life for your children? 
If you do, then please – may Allah guide you and us to the truth – consider the following: 
That Allah has created mankind for a great purpose, which is to worship Allah alone with no partner or associate. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And I (Allah) created not the jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone).
I seek not any provision from them (i.e. provision for themselves or for My creatures) nor do I ask that they should feed Me (i.e. feed themselves or My creatures).
Verily, Allah is the All-Provider, Owner of Power, the Most Strong”
[al-Dhaariyaat 51:56-58] 
Allah sent the Messengers to call mankind to this purpose. He said (interpretation of the meaning):
 “And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (community, nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): “Worship Allah (Alone), and avoid (or keep away from) Taaghoot (all false deities, i.e. do not worship Taaghoot besides Allah).” Then of them were some whom Allah guided and of them were some upon whom the straying was justified. So travel through the land and see what was the end of those who denied (the truth)”
[al-Nahl 16:36]
 Then Allah sent the final Messenger, Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). He was the last of the Prophets and Messengers. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but he is the Messenger of Allah and the last (end) of the Prophets. And Allah is Ever All-Aware of everything”
[al-Ahzaab 33:40] 
“Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. And those who are with him are severe against disbelievers, and merciful among themselves. You see them bowing and falling down prostrate (in prayer), seeking Bounty from Allah and (His) Good Pleasure. The mark of them (i.e. of their Faith) is on their faces (foreheads) from the traces of prostration (during prayers). This is their description in the Tawraat (Torah). But their description in the Injeel (Gospel) is like a (sown) seed which sends forth its shoot, then makes it strong, and becomes thick and it stands straight on its stem, delighting the sowers, that He may enrage the disbelievers with them. Allah has promised those among them who believe (i.e. all those who follow Islamic Monotheism, the religion of Prophet Muhammad till the Day of Resurrection) and do righteous good deeds, forgiveness and a mighty reward (i.e. Paradise)”
[al-Fath 48:29] 
One of the reasons why He sent the Messengers was so as to establish proof against mankind, lest they say, “No Messenger came to us and no one told us that Allah commanded us to worship Him.” Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, We have sent the Revelation to you (O Muhammad) as We sent the Revelation to Nooh (Noah) and the Prophets after him; We (also) sent the Revelation to Ibraaheem (Abraham), Ismaa‘eel (Ishmael), Ishaaq (Isaac), Ya‘qoob (Jacob), and Al-Asbaat [the offspring of the twelve sons of Ya‘qaab (Jacob)], ‘Eesa (Jesus), Ayyoob (Job), Yoonus (Jonah), Haaroon (Aaron), and Sulaymaan (Solomon); and to Daawood (David) We gave the Zaboor (Psalms).
And Messengers We have mentioned to you before, and Messengers We have not mentioned to you, — and to Moosa (Moses) Allah spoke directly.
Messengers as bearers of good news as well as of warning in order that mankind should have no plea against Allah after the (coming of) Messengers. And Allah is Ever All-Powerful, All-Wise
[al-Nisaa’ 4:163-165] 
We call you, and everyone who does not follow the religion of Islam, to hasten to obey the command of Allah by believing in Him alone, with no partner or associate, and to believe in His Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), whom Allah sent to all of creation, men and jinn alike. Allah has commanded them to do this, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O mankind! Verily, there has come to you the Messenger (Muhammad) with the truth from your Lord. So believe in him, it is better for you. But if you disbelieve, then certainly to Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. And Allah is Ever All-Knowing, All-Wise.
O people of the Scripture (Christians)! Do not exceed the limits in your religion, nor say of Allah aught but the truth. The Messiah ‘Eesa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), was (no more than) a Messenger of Allah and His Word, (“Be!” — and he was) which He bestowed on Maryam (Mary) and a spirit (Rooh) created by Him; so believe in Allah and His Messengers. Say not: “Three (trinity)!” Cease! (it is) better for you. For Allah is (the only) One Ilaah (God), glory is to Him (Far Exalted is He) above having a son. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. And Allah is All-Sufficient as a Disposer of affairs”
[al-Nisaa’ 4:170-171] 
Allah has told us in His Noble Book (the Qur’aan) that He does not accept any religion other than Islam. Allah says (interpretation of the meanings):
“And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers”
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:85] 
“Allah bears witness that Laa ilaaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), and the angels, and those having knowledge (also give this witness); (He always) maintains His creation in justice. Laa ilaaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.
Truly, the religion with Allah is Islam. Those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) did not differ except, out of mutual jealousy, after knowledge had come to them. And whoever disbelieves in the Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allah, then surely, Allah is Swift in calling to account
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:18-19]
 Do not forget that if you become Muslim, it will be better for your children, so that they will not be confused or suffer from mental anguish, and say, “Our father is a Muslim and our mother is a Christian, so who should we follow?” 
Perhaps thinking through these matters more deeply will lead to a good result, by Allah’s leave. Strive to read a sound translation of the Qur’aan, which is considered to be the miracle of the Prophet of Islam, then read the biography of the Messenger Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and how Allah granted success to him and his Companions, and how Allah supported him with miracles, such as making water flow from between his fingers and the splitting the moon, when the mushrikoon (polytheists) asked for a sign – so he commanded the moon to split, and it split in two – and other events which are recorded in his Seerah (biography). And he also spoke of unseen matters which could not be known except by means of Revelation, such as when he said that the empires of the Persians and Romans (Byzantines) would be conquered before it happened, and other matters which are indicative of his Prophethood.

He said: 
“This is an idea which is common among some people. Some of the people think that a pregnant woman cannot be divorced by Talaq. I do not know where they get this idea from, for it has no basis in the words of the scholars. Rather the view of all the scholars is that a pregnant woman can be divorced by talaq . There is consensus on this point among the scholars, and there is no dispute. 
Talaq according to the Sunnah means that a woman may be divorced in two cases: 

She may be divorced when she is pregnant ; this is a Sunnah divorce and is not Bid`ah.
She should be Tahir (pure, i.e., not menstruating) and her husband should not have touched her (i.e., had intercourse with her), i.e., she should have become Tahir following menstruation or postpartum bleeding and before he has intercourse with her. Divorce in this case is in accordance with the Sunnah.” (Fatawa At-Talaq by Shaykh Ibn Baz, 1/45-46) 

So long as he took her back during the `iddah, then she is still his wife, because the `iddah of a woman who is pregnant ends when she gives birth, and her husband took her back before she gave birth. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And for those who are pregnant (whether they are divorced or their husbands are dead), their `iddah (prescribed period) is until they lay down their burden.” [At-Talaq 65:4]
This is the `iddah of the pregnant woman whether she is divorced or widowed. The husband should count this as one talaq.

This is allowed after exhausting all possible means of treating the problem. But after the soul has been breathed into the foetus it is not permissible to abort it because of deformity.
 The parents have to be patient and accept the will and decree of Allaah, and remember the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you and that you like a thing which is bad for you. Allaah knows but you do not know”
[al-Baqarah 2:216] 
“it may be that you dislike a thing and Allaah brings through it a great deal of good”
[al-Nisa’ 4:19]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “How wonderful is the affair of the believer, for all his affairs are good, and that applies to no one but the believer. If something good happens to him he gives thanks and that is good for him, and if something bad happens to him he bears it with patience and that is good for him.” Narrated by Muslim, 2999. 
Secondly: Here we will add something from a fatwa of the Standing Committee concerning this matter. 
The Standing Committee was asked about aborting a pregnancy in the fifth month, after scans proved that the foetus was deformed and the top of the skull was absent. 
They replied: 
It is not permissible to abort the foetus because of the deformity mentioned in the question. Allaah may heal the foetus during the remainder of the pregnancy, and it may be born normal and healthy, as has happened to many people. 
Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 21/440. 
They were also asked about a pregnant woman who was treated for cancer with radiotherapy, which would affect the foetus and cause it to be born deformed – is it permissible to abort it? 
They replied: 
It is not permissible to abort the foetus which it is feared may be deformed. Rather the matter should be left to the will of Allaah; it may be free of deformity.

They were also asked about a woman in the fifth month of pregnancy; scans had shown the presence of several deformities in the foetus which made the doctors sure that it would die after birth. These deformities were as follows:  a deformity in the heart, a severe deformity of the spinal cord and spinal column, the size of the head is very small, there is a large sac between the head and body that is bigger than the head, the intestines are outside the abdominal cavity, and there is a deformity in the brain. Is it permissible to abort it? 
They replied: 
After studying the question, the Committee replied that it is not permissible to abort this pregnancy, because often the doctor’s reports are speculative, and the basic principle is that the foetus must be respected and it is forbidden to abort it, because Allaah may make the foetus whole during the remainder of the pregnancy, so it may be born free of the things that the doctors mentioned, even if what they said was correct. We must think positively of Allaah and ask Him to heal him and make him whole, and to cause him to be born healthy. His parents have to fear Allaah and ask Him to heal him from all ills and to delight them with a healthy child. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah says: ‘I am as My slave thinks I am.’”

They were also asked about a woman in the fifth month of pregnancy, whose foetus has some deformities which expose the mother’s life to danger. Is it permissible to abort it? 
They replied: 
After studying the question, the Committee replied that if the situation is as described, and continuation of the pregnancy to full term will result in danger to the mother’s life, then there is nothing wrong with aborting the pregnancy before it reaches full term, in order to protect the mother’s life. But if the abortion is because of the deformities only, then it is not permissible to abort the pregnancy.

12290,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12290,There is no contradiction between the fact that Allah descends to the lowest heaven and His having risen above the Throne (istiwaa’),"When asked ""Where is Allah ?""
I reply ""Above the seven Heavens and the Arsh""
But taking the Hadith regarding that Allah descends to the lowest heaven in the latter part of the night.
If someone asks where is Allah and they state it is the latter 3rd of the night now. What reply should you give. Another point is that some people say it is the latter part of the night all the time (somewhere on the earth at a paticular point in time) From this they conclude that Allah is not above His Arsh.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly, we have to know the ‘aqeedah (belief) of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah concerning the names and attributes of Allah. The belief of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah is to affirm the names and attributes which Allah has affirmed for Himself, without distorting or denying them, discussing how they are or likening them to anything else. They believe that which Allah has commanded them to believe, for Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“There is nothing like Him, and He is the All Hearer, the All Seer”
[al-Shooraa 42:11] 
Allah has told us about Himself. He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Indeed, your Lord is Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth in Six Days, and then He rose over (Istawaa) the Throne (really in a manner that suits His Majesty). [al-A’raaf 7:54] 
“The Most Gracious (Allah) rose over (Istawaa) the (Mighty) Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty). [Ta-Ha 20:5] 
and there are other aayahs which mention that Allah rose over His Throne. 
The rising of Allah over His Throne, which means that He Himself is High and above the Throne, is of a special nature which befits His Majesty and Might. No one knows how it is except Him. 
 
This was proven in the saheeh Sunnah, where it is narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that Allah descends during the last third of the night. It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Our Lord descends every night to the lowest heaven when the last third of the night remains, and He says, ‘Who will call Me that I might answer him, who will ask of Me that I might give him, who will ask My forgiveness, that I might forgive him?’” (narrated by al-Bukhaari, Kitaab al-Tawheed, 6940; Muslim, Salaat al-Musaafireen, 1262)
According to Ahl al-Sunnah, the meaning of this descent is that Allah Himself comes down to the lowest heaven in a real sense, as befits His Majesty, and no one knows how that is except Him. 
But does the fact that Allah comes down mean that He vacates the Throne or not? Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said concerning a similar question: we say that this question is based on unnecessary and excessive questioning, and that the one who asked this is not to be thanked for his question. We ask, are you more keen than the Sahaabah to understand the attributes of Allah? If he says yes, we tell him, you are lying. And if he says no, we tell him, then be content with what they were content with. They did not ask the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), ‘O Messenger of Allah, when He comes down, does He vacate the Throne?’ Why do you need to ask this question? Just say, He comes down. Whether or not the Throne is vacated is not your business. You are commanded to believe the reports, especially concerning the essence of Allah and His attributes, for this matter is above rational thought. 
Majmoo’ Fatawa Shaykh Muhammad al-‘Uthaymeen, 1/204-205 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said concerning this matter: 
“The correct view is that He descends and that He does not vacate the Throne. A person's soul remains attached to his body night and day until he dies, but when he is asleep it ascends… It was said, night varies, and the last third of the night comes sooner in the east than in the west, so the descent of Allah to the lowest heaven, of which His Messenger spoke, happens in the east first and then in the west...” 
See Majmoo’ Fatawa Ibn Taymiyah, 5/132 
Rising over (istiwaa’) and descending are two of the practical attributes which have to do with the will of Allah. Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah believe in that, but in this belief they avoid likening Allah to any of His creation or discussing how He is. It cannot occur to them that Allah’s descending is like the descending of any of His creatures or that His rising over the Throne is like the rising over of any of His creatures, because they believe that there is nothing like unto Allah and He is the All-Hearer, All-Seer. They know on rational grounds that there is a great difference between the Creator and His creatures, in their essence, attributes and actions. It cannot occur to them to ask how He descends, or how He rose over His Throne. The point is that they do not ask how His attributes are; they believe that there is a ‘how’, but it is unknown, so we can never imagine how it is. 
We know for certain that what is narrated in the Book of Allah or the Sunnah of His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is true and is not self-contradictory, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Do they not then consider the Quran carefully? Had it been from other than Allah, they would surely, have found therein many a contradiction” [al-Nisaa’ 4:82] 
because contradictions in the reports would mean that some of them were showing others to be false, and this is impossible in the case of that which Allah and His Messenger tell us. 
Whoever imagines that there are any contradictions in the Book of Allah or the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), or between the two, it is either because of his lack of knowledge or because he has failed to understand properly or to ponder the matter correctly, so let him seek further knowledge and strive to think harder until the truth becomes clear to him. Then if the matter is still not clear to him, let him leave it to the One Who is All-Knowing and let him put a stop to his illusions and say, as those who are firmly grounded in knowledge say, “We believe in it; the whole of it (clear and unclear Verses) are from our Lord” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:7 – interpretation of the meaning]. Let him know that there is no contradiction in the Quran and Sunnah and no conflict between them. And Allah knows best. 
See Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 3/237-238 
Imagining that there is a conflict between Allah’s descending to the lowest heaven and His having risen over the Throne and His being high above the heavens stems from making a comparison between the Creator and the created being. For man cannot imagine the unseen things of His creation, such as the delights of Paradise, so how can he imagine the Creator, may He be glorified and exalted, the Knower of the Unseen. So we believe in what has been narrated of His rising over (the Throne), His descending and His being High and Exalted. We affirm that (and state that it is) in a manner that befits His Majesty and Might.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
12292,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12292,Upholding the ties of kinship is obligatory to the extent that one is able to do it,"I have sisters who are married and my mother is married to someone other than my father, because my father is deceased. I work in the army and I want to go and see them but my circumstances do not permit it. I am also married and if I go there and leave my family, I would have to stay there for at least three days, during which time I would be worrying about my wife and children. Am I severing the ties of kinship, given that I have not been in touch with them for ten months?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Upholding the ties of kinship is obligatory to the extent that one is able to do it, starting with the closest and then the next closest. There is a great deal of goodness in it and it serves many interests. Severing the ties of kinship is a major sin, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Would you then, if you were given the authority, do mischief in the land, and sever your ties of kinship?
23. Such are they whom Allaah has cursed, so that He has made them deaf and blinded their sight”
[Muhammad 47:22]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No one who severs the ties of kinship will enter Paradise.” Narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh. 
When a man asked him, “O Messenger of Allaah, whom should I honour?” He said: “Your mother.” He said: “Then whom?” He said: “Your mother.” He said: “Then whom?” He said: “Your mother.” He said: “Then whom?” The fourth time he said: “Your father, then the next closest and the next closest.” Also narrated by Muslim. 
In al-Saheeh it is narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever would like his provision to be increased and his lifespan to be extended, let him uphold the ties of kinship.” 
There are many ahaadeeth on this topic. What you have to do is to uphold the ties of kinship to the extent that you are able to, by visiting them if possible, or by writing or phoning. It is also prescribed for you to uphold kinship ties financially too, if the relative is poor. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you can”
[al-Taghaabun 64:16]
“Allaah burdens not a person beyond his scope”
[al-Baqarah 2:286]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When I command you to do something, do as much of it as you can.” Saheeh – agreed upon.

12295,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12295,What Are the Conditions of La Ilaha Illa-Allah?,"Can you please explain the conditions of La ilaha illa-Allah (knowledge, certainty, etc.), and tell us the rulings on one who does not attain them and one who is ignorant of the meaning of La ilaha illa-Allah?","The conditions of La ilaha illa-Allah are: knowledge, certainty, submission, following, truthfulness, sincerity and love.",The conditions of La ilaha illa-Allah,"Praise be to Allah.The conditions of La ilaha illa-Allah 
Shaykh Hafiz al-Hukmi said in his poem Sullam al-Wusul: 
“Knowledge, certainty, submission and following. So listen to what I say.
Truthfulness, sincerity and love. May Allah help you to do that which He loves.”

The first condition is knowledge, in the sense of negating what is negated in the Shahadah and affirming what is affirmed therein – as opposed to being ignorant of that.

 Allah says (interpretation of the meanings):
 “So know (O Muhammad) that La ilaha illa-Allah (none has the right to be worshipped but Allah)…” [Muhammad 47:19]
 “except for those who bear witness to the truth knowingly” –  i.e., that there is no god except Allah (La ilaha illa-Allah ) – “and they know” – in their hearts the meaning of the words that they utter with their lips. [al-Zukhruf 43:86]
 It is narrated in al-Sahih from ‘Uthman (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever dies knowing that there is no god except Allah will enter Paradise.”

The second condition is certainty, in the sense that the one who says these words is absolutely certain of their meaning. Faith is not sufficient unless it is based on certain knowledge with no element of speculation, let alone doubt. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“Only those are the believers who have believed in Allah and His Messenger, and afterward doubt not but strive with their wealth and their lives for the Cause of Allah. Those! They are the truthful” [al-Hujurat 49:15] 
The sincerity of their faith in Allah and His Messenger is conditional upon there being no element of doubt therein, As for the doubter, he is one of the hypocrites. In al-Sahih, it is narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Bear witness that there is no god except Allah and that I am the Messenger of Allah, for no person meets Allah with these two, not doubting in them, but he will enter Paradise.’” According to another report: “No person meets Allah with these two, not doubting in them, and is denied Paradise.” 
And it was also narrated from Abu Hurayrah in a lengthy hadith that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sent him and said, “Whoever you meet behind this wall who bears witness that there is no god except Allah, believing in it with certainty in his heart, then give him the glad tidings of Paradise.”
Thus we see that a person’s entering Paradise for saying these words is conditional upon his believing in them with certainty in his heart, with no element of doubt. If this condition is not met the target is not met. 

The third condition is acceptance and submission to what these words imply, both in one's heart as well as verbally. Allah has told us the stories of those who came before, who were saved by their acceptance of these words from the punishment of those who had rejected them. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):

 “(It will be said to the angels): ‘Assemble those who did wrong, together with their companions (from the devils) and what they used to worship,
Instead of Allah, and lead them on to the way of flaming Fire (Hell);
But stop them, verily, they are to be questioned.
What is the matter with you? Why do you not help one another (as you used to do in the world)?’
Nay, but that Day they shall surrender.
And they will turn to one another and question one another.
They will say: ‘It was you who used to come to us from the right side (i.e., from the right side of one of us and beautify for us every evil, enjoin on us polytheism, and stop us from the truth, i.e. Islamic Monotheism and from every good deed).’
They will reply: ‘Nay, you yourselves were not believers.
And we had no authority over you. Nay! But you were Taghun (transgressing) people (polytheists, and disbelievers).
So now the Word of our Lord has been justified against us, that we shall certainly (have to) taste (the torment).
So we led you astray because we were ourselves astray.’
Then verily, that Day, they will (all) share in the torment.
Certainly, that is how We deal with Al-Mujrimun (polytheists, sinners, disbelievers, criminals, the disobedient to Allah).
Truly, when it was said to them: La ilaha illa-Allah (none has the right “to be worshipped but Allah),” they puffed themselves up with pride (i.e. denied it).
And (they) said: ‘Are we going to abandon our alihah (gods) for the sake of a mad poet?’” [al-Saffat 37:22-36]
 So Allah has made the reason and cause of their punishment their arrogant refusal to say La ilaha ill-Allah, and their disbelief in the one who brought this message, so that they did not negate what this word negates and they did not affirm what it affirms, rather they said, arrogantly denouncing:
 “‘Has he made the alihah (gods) (all) into One Ilah (God — Allah). Verily, this is a curious thing!’
And the leaders among them went about (saying): ‘Go on, and remain constant to your alihah (gods)! Verily, this is a thing designed (against you)!’”[Sad 38:5] 
So Allah showed them to be liars and threw their words back at them through the words of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). He said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Nay! he (Muhammad) has come with the truth (i.e. Allah’s religion — Islamic Monotheism and this Quran) and he confirms the Messengers (before him who brought Allah’s religion — Islamic Monotheism)” [al-Saffat 37:37]
Then He said concerning those who accept it (interpretation of the meaning):
 “Save the chosen slaves of Allah (i.e. the true believers of Islamic Monotheism).
For them there will be a known provision (in Paradise),
Fruits; and they shall be honoured,
In the Gardens of Delight (Paradise)” [al-Saffat 37:40-43] 
In al-Sahih, it is narrated from Abu Musa (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The guidance and knowledge with which Allah has sent me is like abundant rain which falls on the land. Some of the land absorbs the water and brings forth much grass and vegetation. And some of (the rain) falls on another part of the land which is like a smooth plain and does not hold the water, so no vegetation grows. That is the likeness of the one who understands the religion of Allah and benefits from that with which Allah has sent me, so he learns and acts, and the likeness of the one who pays no heed and does not accept the guidance of Allah with which I have been sent. 

The fourth condition is following that which is indicated, as opposed to not following it. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“And whosoever submits his face (himself) to Allah, while he is a Muhsin (good-doer, i.e. performs good deeds totally for Allah’s sake), then he has grasped the most trustworthy handhold” – i.e., La ilaha illa-Allah – “And to Allah return all matters for decision.” [Luqman 31:22] 
What is meant by “submitting one’s face” is following, when one is also a doer of good and a believer in Tawhid. Whoever does not submit his face to Allah and is not a doer of good has not grasped the most trustworthy handhold. This is what is meant by the following verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And whoever disbelieves, let not his disbelief grieve you (O Muhammad). To Us is their return, and We shall inform them what they have done…” [Luqman 31:23] 
According to a sahih hadith, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “none of you truly believes until his desire is in accordance with that which I have brought.” This is the ultimate meaning of following. 

The fifth condition is truthfulness, as opposed to lying. This means that one says it (La ilaha illa-Allah ) sincerely from the heart, with harmony between what is in the heart and what is said on the lips. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):

 “Do people think that they will be left alone because they say: ‘We believe,’ and will not be tested.
And We indeed tested those who were before them. And Allah will certainly make (it) known (the truth of) those who are true, and will certainly make (it) known (the falsehood of) those who are liars, (although Allah knows all that before putting them to test)” [al-'Ankabut 29:2-3] 
And He said concerning the hypocrites who spoke these words falsely (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And of mankind, there are some (hypocrites) who say: ‘We believe in Allah and the Last Day,’ while in fact they believe not.
They (think to) deceive Allah and those who believe, while they only deceive themselves, and perceive (it) not!
In their hearts is a disease (of doubt and hypocrisy) and Allah has increased their disease. A painful torment is theirs because they used to tell lies” [al-Baqarah 2:8-10] 
In al-Sahihayn, it is narrated from Mu’adh ibn Jabal (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “there is no one who bears witness that there is no god except Allah and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger, sincerely from the heart, but Allah will make him forbidden for the Fire.” 

The sixth condition is sincerity, which means that actions are free from any element of shirk. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

“Surely, the religion (i.e. the worship and the obedience) is for Allah only [al-Zumar 39:3] 
“Say (O Muhammad): ‘Allah Alone I worship by doing religious deeds sincerely for His sake only’” [al-Zumar 39:14]
 In al-Sahih, it is narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The most deserving of my intercession are those who say La ilaha illa-Allah sincerely from the heart or from the soul.”

The seventh condition is love for this word and for what it implies and indicates, and love for the people who act upon it and adhere to its conditions and hate whoever or whatever goes against it. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):

 “And of mankind are some who take (for worship) others besides Allah as rivals (to Allah). They love them as they love Allah” [al-Baqarah 2:165]
 Allah tells us that those who believe love Allah more, because they do not associate anything with Him in that love, as is done by those among the mushrikin who claim to love Him but who also take others as rivals to Him whom they love as they love Him. 
In al-Sahihayn, it is narrated from Anas that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No one of you truly believes until I am more beloved to him that his son, his father and all of mankind.”

      If breastfeeding is proven to have taken place, and he was 
      breastfed fully five or more times within the first two years of life, 
      then your brother is a son to your maternal uncle through breastfeeding, 
      and he is a son of your uncle’s wife who breastfed him. Their children are 
      his brothers, and your maternal uncle’s brothers are his paternal uncles 
      and his sisters are his paternal aunts. The brothers of the woman who 
      breastfed him are his maternal uncles and her sisters are his maternal 
      aunts, because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon

      breastfeeding is that which become mahram through blood ties.” Saheeh – 
      agreed upon.

    and it is not permissible for you or your sisters to uncover in front of the 
    sons of your maternal uncle on the grounds that your brother was breastfed

12298,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12298,Ruling on marrying a fifth wife during the ‘iddah following divorce of the fourth wife,"If a man has 4 wives and he divorces one of them,is it permissible for him to marry someone else during this iddah period? What is the daleel,if the answer is no it's not permissible for him to marry someone during the iddah period will that last marriage be valid and what should be done to rectify the situation according to the quraan and sunnah.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    If the divorce that has been issued to the fourth wife is a 
    revocable divorce – i.e., it is the first or second talaaq – then the 
    scholars are unanimously agreed that a woman who has been given a revocable 
    divorce is still to be considered a wife until her ‘iddah is over. (al-Mughni, 
    7/104).  If it is proven that she is still your wife, then you should note 
    that the scholars are agreed that it is not permissible for a free man to 
    have more than four wives at one time, because of the hadeeth narrated by 
    al-Tirmidhi (1128) from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) that 
    Ghaylaan ibn Salamah al-Thaqafi became Muslim and he had ten wives during 
    the Jaahiliyyah; they became Muslim along with him, and the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded him to choose four of 
    them. This was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani, as stated in Saheeh Sunan 
    al-Tirmidhi, 1/329. 

    It is clear from the above that it is not permissible for a 
    man to marry a fifth wife during the ‘iddah of a wife who has been given a 
    revocable divorce, because by doing so he will have five wives at the same 
    time, and the Sahaabah, the four imams and all of Ahl al-Sunnah 
    wa’l-Jamaa’ah are agreed, in word and deed, that it is not permissible for a 
    man to have more than four wives at one time, except for the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah 
    said in al-Fataawa al-Kubra (4/154), that the great Taabi’i ‘Ubaydah 
    al-Salmaani said: “The companions of Muhammad  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) did not agree on anything as much as they agreed that a 
    fifth wife cannot be married during the ‘iddah of the fourth, and a woman 
    cannot be taken as a co-wife with her sister.” Whoever wants to have more 
    than four wives is going against the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His 
    Messenger Muhammad  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and is 
    going against Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah. 

    See Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, al-Fataawa al-Jaami’ah 
    li’l-Mar’ah al-Muslimah, 2/641. 
If this has taken place, 
    then the marriage contract is invalid, and you have to leave her until the 
    ‘iddah of your divorced wife is over. If you have consummated the marriage 
    with her – i.e., with the fifth wife – then you have to give her the mahr 
    that is given to women of her social standing, and she has to wait out the 
    ‘iddah of one who is divorced. Then if you want to marry her after that, you 
    must make another marriage contract with her, meeting all the conditions 
    prescribed in sharee’ah for a marriage contract.

     But if your divorce of the fourth wife is an irrevocable 
    divorce – i.e., a third talaaq – then there is a difference of scholarly 
    opinion as to whether it is permissible to marry a fifth wife during the 
    ‘iddah of the fourth wife following a third talaaq. The Hanbalis and Hanafis 
    say that this is not allowed, and this is the view regarded as most correct 
    by Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him). See 
    Kitaab Fataawa al-Talaaq by Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 1/278. On this basis, the 
    ruling is the same as that described above in the case of a revocable 
    divorce. When the ‘iddah of the woman who has been divorced for a third time 
    comes to an end, it is then permissible for him to make a marriage contract 
    with her (the fifth woman). And Allaah knows best. 

    But in the case of the fourth wife dying, it is permissible 
    for him to get married after she dies, because the marriage is not 
    considered to be still in effect in this case.
