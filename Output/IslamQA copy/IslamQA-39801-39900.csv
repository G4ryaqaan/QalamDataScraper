“they were plotting and Allaah too was plotting”
[al-Anfaal 8:30] 
“Verily, the hypocrites seek to deceive Allaah, but it is He Who deceives them”
[al-Nisa’ 4:142]?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The attributes of Allaah are all attributes of perfection, pointing to the best and most perfect of meanings. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and for Allaah is the highest description. And He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise”
[al-Nahl 16:60] 
“His is the highest description (i.e. none has the right to be worshipped but He, and there is nothing comparable unto Him) in the heavens and in the earth. And He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise”
[al-Room 30:27]
Al-Sa’di said in his Tafseer (commentary) – p. 718, 1065: 
The highest description means the most perfect attributes. 
Attributes are of three types: 
1 – Attributes of perfection – in which there is no shortcoming whatsoever. These attributes apply to Allaah in absolute terms and are not limited or restricted in any way. Examples of that include His knowledge, power, hearing, seeing, mercy, etc. 
2 – Attributes which imply imperfection and shortcomings. These can never be ascribed to Allaah, such as sleeping, being unable, doing wrong or oppressing, betraying, etc. 
3 – Attributes which may be perfect or imperfect, depending on the context. These cannot be ascribed to Allaah in absolute terms, and they cannot be denied in the case of Allaah in absolute terms. If the context implies perfection then they can be ascribed to Allaah; if it implies imperfection then they cannot be ascribed to Allaah. Examples include: plotting, deceiving and mocking. 
Plotting against, betraying and mocking the enemy are attributes of perfection, because that is indicative of complete knowledge, power and might, and so on. 
But plotting against the sincere believers is an attribute of imperfection. 
Hence these characteristics are not ascribed to Allaah in absolute terms, rather they are mentioned in such a context as to indicate that these are attributes of perfection.
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, the hypocrites seek to deceive Allaah, but it is He Who deceives them”
[al-Nisa’ 4:142]
This is deceiving the hypocrites. 
And He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And (remember) when the disbelievers plotted against you (O Muhammad) to imprison you, or to kill you, or to get you out (from your home, i.e. Makkah); they were plotting and Allaah too was plotting; and Allaah is the Best of those who plot”
[al-Anfaal 8:30]
This is a plot against the enemies of Allaah who were plotting against the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
Allaah says of the hypocrites (interpretation of the meaning):
“And when they meet those who believe, they say: ‘We believe,’ but when they are alone with their Shayaateen (devils — polytheists, hypocrites), they say: ‘Truly, we are with you; verily, we were but mocking.’
Allaah mocks at them and gives them increase in their wrong-doing to wander blindly”
[al-Baqarah 2:14-15]
This is mocking the hypocrites. 
These attributes are to be regarded as indicating perfection in this context. Hence we say that Allaah mocks the hypocrites and deceives them, and that He plots against His enemies, and so on. But it is not permissible to describe Allaah as mocking or deceiving in absolute terms, because that does not indicate perfection.
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: Can Allaah be described as plotting and named as such? 
He replied: 
Allaah cannot be described as plotting except in a limited sense; He cannot be described as such in absolute terms. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Did they then feel secure against the Plan of Allaah? None feels secure from the Plan of Allaah except the people who are the losers”
[al-A’raaf 7:99]
This verse indicate that Allaah has a plan or plot, which was to confound them without them realizing it. This is akin to the hadeeth narrated by al-Bukhaari: “War is deceit.” 
If it is asked: How can Allaah be described as plotting when this seems to be something  blameworthy? 
The answer is that plotting in the right circumstances may be something praiseworthy that points to the strength of the plotter, and that he is superior to his enemy. Hence Allaah cannot be described as plotting in absolute terms, and we cannot say “Allaah is a Plotter.” Rather this attribute is mentioned in a context where it is positive, such as the verses (interpretation of the meaning): 
“they were plotting and Allaah too was plotting”
[al-Anfaal 8:30] 
“So they plotted a plot, and We planned a plan, while they perceived not”
[al-Naml 27:50] 
And we cannot say in absolute terms that this cannot be ascribed to Allaah, rather in contexts where it is something positive it may be ascribed to Him, and in contexts where it is not something positive, it should not be ascribed to Him. So Allaah should not be called by a name which refers to this, so we cannot say that one of the names of Allaah is “the Plotter”. Plotting is one of His actions, because it has to do with the Will of Allaah. 
Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 1/170. 
He was also asked: Can Allaah be described as betraying, or as deceiving, as in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, the hypocrites seek to deceive Allaah, but it is He Who deceives them”
[al-Nisa’ 4:142]? 
He replied: 
With regard to betrayal, this is something that can never be ascribed to Allaah, because it is something shameful in all circumstances, and it is plotting at a time of trust, which is blameworthy. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“But if they intend to betray you (O Muhammad), they indeed betrayed Allaah before. So He gave (you) power over them. And Allaah is All-Knower, All-Wise”
[al-Anfaal 8:71]
And He did not say: So He betrayed them. 
With regard to deceiving, it is like plotting. It may be ascribed to Allaah when it is something positive, but it cannot be ascribed to Him in absolute terms. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, the hypocrites seek to deceive Allaah, but it is He Who deceives them”

There is nothing wrong with drawing pictures of inanimate objects such as mountains, trees, planes, cars, etc.","Drawing of animate beings


Drawing of inanimate objects","Praise be to Allah.Drawing of animate beings
Drawing is of two types: 
One is drawing pictures of animate beings . It says in the Sunnah that this is forbidden. It is not permitted to draw anything that depicts animate beings, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, according to the sahih hadith: “Every image maker will be in the Fire.” And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The most severely punished of people on the Day of Resurrection will be the image-makers, those who tried to imitate the creation of Allah.” And he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The makers of these images will be punished on the Day of Resurrection, and they will be told, ‘Give life to that which you have created.’” 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed those who consume riba (interest, usury) and those who pay it, and he cursed the image-makers. This indicates that making images is forbidden. The scholars interpreted that as referring to images of animate beings such as animals, people and birds. 
Drawing of inanimate objects
With regard to drawing inanimate objects – which is the second type of drawing – there is no sin in that, such as drawing mountains, trees, planes, cars and the like. There is nothing wrong with that, according to the scholars. 
With regard to forbidden kinds of pictures, an exception is made in cases of necessity , such as drawing pictures of criminals so that they will be known and caught, or pictures for identity cards which are essential and which cannot be obtained otherwise, and other cases of necessity. 
If the ruler decides that producing images of criminals is necessary, because of the seriousness of their crimes and to protect the Muslims from their evil when they are known, or for other reasons, there is nothing wrong with that. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):  
“…He has explained to you in detail what is forbidden to you, except under compulsion of necessity …” [al-An’am 6:119]

39814,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39814,She did not do the tawaaf of ‘Umrah because she was menstruating,"I did ‘Umrah during the last two days of Ramadaan, but at that time I had my period, so I entered ihraam from the meeqaat and did saa’i between al-Safa and al-Marwah, and I cut my hair, but the menses prevented me from doing tawaaf. Around one day after my period ended I did the Eid prayer, and I did the farewell tawaaf, and we came back to our country. Is this ‘Umrah valid?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.You did some things right, and you make mistakes in others. You did right to enter ihraam from the meeqaat – even though you were menstruating – and you did right to refrain from doing tawaaf, but you made a mistake by doing saa’i and cutting your hair, and you did a mistake by not doing the tawaaf of ‘Umrah and saa’i after you became pure. 
Some scholars regard doing saa’i before tawaaf as permissible in Hajj, but not in ‘Umrah. 
Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen said: 
It is essential to do tawaaf before saa’i; if he starts with saa’i before tawaaf, he must repeat it after tawaaf, because he did it in the wrong order. 
If someone were to say: What do you say about the saheeh report from the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) which says that he was asked by a man who said to him: “I did saa’i before tawaaf,” and he said: “Do it, and it doesn’t matter”? 
The answer is that this was in Hajj and not in ‘Umrah. End quote. 
Al-Sharh al-Mumti’ (7/310). 
Now you are still in a state of ihraam for ‘Umrah, because it was not completed. What you have to do is go back to Makkah and do the tawaaf of ‘Umrah that you omitted, and repeat saa’i once more, and you have to cut your hair after that; the fact that you cut your hair before does not count because it was done in the wrong order. 
The scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas said concerning one who did tawaaf without being in a state of purity (tahaarah): 
You are still in ihraam for ‘Umrah, if you did not repeat tawaaf in a state of purity, and you have to go to Makkah in ihraam as soon as possible and circumambulate the Ka’bah and do saa’i, then shave your heard or cut your hair, and thus you will have completed your ‘Umrah. End quote.

Missing the time for prayer


Is it prohibited to delay prayer?




Is it Sunnah to delay `Isha’?


Reasons for delaying prayer","Praise be to Allah.To find out about the times of prayer and when they begin and end, please see question no. 9940 . 
Difference between delaying prayer and missing the time for prayer
With regard to your question about the difference between delaying prayer and missing the time for prayer, the answer is as follows: 
Missing the time for prayer
Missing the time for prayer means delaying the prayer until the time is over and one has not prayed. This is a major sin, unless that is for a legitimate excuse such as sleeping or forgetting. 
It says in Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah, 10/8: “The jurists agreed that it is forbidden to delay prayer until the time for prayer is over, without a legitimate excuse.” 
Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “With regard to the person who deliberately delays the prayer until after the time for it is over, or who sets his alarm clock late so that he will not get up on time, he is deliberately not praying, and he has committed a great evil according to all the scholars, but is this disbelief or not? 
Here there is a difference of opinion among the scholars: 
If he does not deny that prayer is obligatory, then the majority of scholars say that he is not committing major disbelief  in this case. 
Some of the scholars were of the view that this is major disbelief which puts him beyond the pale of Islam, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Between a man and shirk [associating others with Allah] and disbelief  there stands his giving up prayer.” (Narrated by Muslim, 82)
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The covenant that stands between us and them is prayer; whoever gives up prayer is a disbeliever.” (Narrated by Ahmad and the four authors of As-Sunan with an authentic Isnad [chain of narrators]) And there is other evidence to support this.
It was also narrated from the Companions of the Prophet (may Allah be pleased with them all). 
The great Tabi’i ‘Abdullah ibn Shaqiq Al-`Aqili (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not think that omitting anything constituted disbelief apart from prayer.” 
Is it prohibited to delay prayer?
With regard to delaying prayer , this may refer to two things: 
1.     Delaying the prayer until the time for that prayer is over. We have explained the ruling on this above.
2.     Delaying the prayer until the end of the time for that prayer. (See Al-Mawsu`ah Al-Fiqhiyyah, 10/6) 
It is permissible to offer a prayer at the end of its time, because of the Hadith narrated by Muslim (614) from Abu Musa Al-Ash’ari (may Allah be pleased with him), that someone came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and asked him about the times of prayer… and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained to him the beginning and end of the time for each prayer, and said, “The time is between these two.” 
But if delaying the prayer means that one will miss out on praying in congregation and will pray it alone at the end of its time, then it is prohibited because it means not praying in congregation, so long as one does not have an excuse for not praying in congregation. 
Is it Sunnah to delay `Isha’?
It is better to do the prayer at the beginning of its time, except for `Isha’ prayer , and also Dhuhr prayer when it is very hot; in these cases it is better to do them at the end of their allotted times. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“It is better to do the prayer at the time required in the Shari`ah. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, answering the one who asked him which deed is most beloved to Allah, “Prayer done on time .” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 527 and Muslim, 85) He did not say prayer at the beginning of its time. That is because the prayers include some which it is Sunnah to pray sooner and some which it is Sunnah to pray later. It is Sunnah to pray `Isha’ later, after one-third of the night has passed. Hence if a woman is at home and asks which is better for me, to pray `Isha’ when I hear the Adhan or to delay it until one-third of the night has passed? We say, it is better to delay it until one-third of the night has passed, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) delayed one night until they said, “O Messenger of Allah, the women and children have fallen asleep,” so he went out and led them in prayer, and said, “This would be its time, were that not too difficult for my Ummah.” So if a woman is in her house, it is better for her to delay it. 
Similarly, if it so happens that some men are travelling, and they ask whether they should pray `Isha’ sooner or later, we would tell them that it is better for them to delay it. 
Similarly if a group goes out for a trip and the time for Isha’ comes, is it better for them to pray `Isha’ sooner or later? We say that it is better for them to delay it if that will not cause them any hardship. 
In the case of the other prayers it is better to pray them sooner unless there is a reason for doing otherwise. So Fajr should be prayed sooner , Dhuhr should be prayed sooner , `Asr should be prayed sooner and Maghrib should be prayed sooner, unless there is a reason for doing otherwise.  
Reasons for delaying prayer 
Such reasons include the following: 
·        If it is intensely hot, then it is better to delay Zuhr prayer until it cools down a little, i.e., until it is nearly time for `Asr, because it cools down a little when it is nearly time for `Asr. When it is intensely hot, it is better to pray when it is cooler, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When it is intensely hot, then wait until it cools down before you pray, for intense heat is from the breeze of Hell.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 537 and Muslim, 615)
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was on a journey and Bilal (may Allah be pleased with him) stood up to give the call to prayer, and he said, “Wait until it gets cooler.” Then [Bilal] stood up to give the call to prayer, and [the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)] said, “Wait until it gets cooler.” Then [Bilal] stood up to give the call to prayer, and [the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)] gave him permission to do so. (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 629 and Muslim, 616) 
·        Another reason is if it will be possible to pray in congregation at the end of the time but not at the beginning, in which case delay is preferable. For example, if a man is outside the city when the time for prayer comes, and he knows that he will reach the city and catch up with the congregation at the end of the time for prayer, is it better for him to pray when the time for prayer comes, or to delay the prayer until he reaches the congregation? 
We say that it is better for him to delay the prayer until he catches up with the congregation; we say that it is even obligatory for him to delay in this case, so that he can catch up with the congregation.” (Fatawa Arkan Al-Islam, p. 287)

39827,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39827,Can You Break an Optional Fast?,"A man wanted to fast six days of Shawwal, and on one day he intended to fast but he broke his fast with no excuse, and he did not complete his fast. Does he have to make up this day after fasting six days of Shawwal, so then the number of days that he fasted will be seven, or should he just fast six days of Shawwal?","If a person is observing an optional fast and something happens and he has to break his fast, then he should break his fast. You do not have to make up the day when you broke your fast, because the one who is observing an optional fast is in charge of himself.",,"Praise be to Allah.The scholars differed concerning one who starts to observe an optional fast : is he obliged to complete it or not? There are two views: 

That he does not have to complete an optional fast. This is the view of the Shafi`is and Hanbalis, who quoted the following evidence: 


`Aishah the Mother of the Believers (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) entered upon me one day and said: ‘Do you have anything (to eat)?’ We said: ‘No.’ He said: ‘Then I am fasting.’ Then he came to us another day and we said: ‘O Messenger of Allah, we have been given some Hays (a kind of meal),’ and he said, ‘Show it to me, for I started the day fasting.’ Then he ate.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1154)
Abu Juhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “… Abu Ad-Darda’ came and he made some food for him – i.e., for Salman. He said: ‘Eat, for I am fasting.’ Salman said: ‘I will not eat until you eat.’ So he ate… and Salman said to him: ‘Your Lord has rights over you, your soul has rights over you, and your family has rights over you, so give each of them their rights.’ Then he came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and told him about that, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Salman is right.’” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1968)
Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “I made some food for the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and when it was served a man said: ‘I am fasting.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Your brother has invited you (to eat) and has gone to some effort for your sake, so break your fast and fast another day in its stead if you wish.’” (Narrated by Ad-Daraqutni, no. 24; classed as sound by Ibn Hajar in Al-Fat-h, 4/210).


The second view is that optional fasts should be completed, and if a person breaks such a fast he has to make it up. This is the view of the Hanafis who quoted the following evidence that such fasts have to be made up: 


`Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “Hafsah and I were given a gift of food and we were fasting, so we broke our fast. Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) entered and we said to him: ‘O Messenger of Allah, we were given this gift and we wanted to eat so we broke our fast.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘It doesn’t matter; fast another day in its stead.’” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 2457; At-Tirmidhi, 735. Its Isnad (chain of narration) includes Zamil, of whom it says in At-Taqreeb: he is Majhul (unknown). It was classed as inauthentic by An-Nawawi in Al-Majmu`, 6/396 and by Ibn Al-Qayyim in Zad Al-Ma`ad, 2/84. It was also classed as inauthentic by Al-Albani.
With regard to the Hadith of `Aishah quoted above from Muslim, some of them add the words: “… ‘I started the day fasting,’ and he ate and said: ‘I will fast another day instead.’”

It should be noted that An-Nasa’i (may Allah have mercy on him) classed this addition as inauthentic and said: This is wrong. It was also classed as inauthentic by Ad-Daraqutni and Al-Bayhaqi. The first view is the one that is more likely to be correct, because its evidence is stronger. And it is supported by the report narrated from Umm Hani’ (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: “O Messenger of Allah, I broke my fast and I was fasting.” He said to her: “Were you making up for a day you had missed?” She said: “No.” He said: “Then it does not matter if it was a voluntary fast.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 2456; classed as authentic by Al-Albani) 
Shaykh Ibn `Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“If a person is observing an optional fast and something happens and he has to break his fast, then he should break his fast. This is what was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), that he came to the Mother of the Believers `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) and said: “Do you have anything to eat?’ She said: “We have been given some Hays (a kind of meal). He said: “Show it to me, for I started the day fasting.” Then he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ate some of it. This has to do with optional fasts, not those that are obligatory.” (Majmu` Al-Fatawa, 20) 
Based on this, you do not have to make up the day when you broke your fast, because the one who is observing a voluntary fast is in charge of himself; rather he should complete six days of Shawwal .

39829,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39829,Borrowing from a riba-based bank in order to buy a house,"I want to take a loan from the bank in order to buy a house. This will involve the following: 

1 – I join the bank al-iskaan (bank that deals in mortgages) and pay 182 dinars a month for four years, i.e., 8736 dinars in total, which will become 10,000 dinars (deposits plus interest). 

2 – Then I will be able to borrow 20,000 dinars from the bank, which I will have 13 years to pay back at an interest rate of 6.75% per year. 

3 – In addition to that, there is a top-up loan of 20,000 with an interest rate of 8.25%. 

When I move into the house, I will be renting it from the bank until the loan is paid off, then it will become mine. The period for paying off the loan is between 13 and 15 years. What is the ruling on this?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Dealing with riba (usury, interest) is a major sin against 
    which Allaah has issued a stern warning. He says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 
“O you who believe! Fear 
    Allaah and give up what remains (due to you) from Ribaa (from now onward) if 
    you are (really) believers.

    279. And if you do not do it, then take a notice of war 
    from Allaah and His Messenger but if you repent, you shall have your capital 
    sums. Deal not unjustly (by asking more than your capital sums), and you 
    shall not be dealt with unjustly (by receiving less than your capital sums)”

    [al-Baqarah 2:278]

    “Those who eat Ribaa will not stand (on the Day of 
    Resurrection) except like the standing of a person beaten by Shaytaan 
    (Satan) leading him to insanity. That is because they say: “Trading is only 
    like Riba,” whereas Allaah has permitted trading and forbidden Riba. So 
    whosoever receives an admonition from his Lord and stops eating Riba, shall 
    not be punished for the past; his case is for Allaah (to judge); but whoever 
    returns (to Riba), such are the dwellers of the Fire — they will abide 
    therein”

    [al-Baqarah 2:275]

    And it was proven that the Prophet  (peace and blessings 
    of Allaah be upon him) cursed the one who consumes riba and the one who pays 
    it. Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5962. In the transaction asked about here, both 
    the individual and the bank are giving and taking riba. The Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “A dirham which a man 
    consumes as riba knowingly is worse before Allaah than thirty-six acts of 
    zina.” Narrated by Ahmad and al-Tabaraani; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani 
    in Saheeh al-Jaami’, no. 3375. And he said: “There are seventy-two 
    types of riba, the least of which is like a man committing incest with his 
    mother.” Narrated by al-Tabaraani in al-Awsat; classed as saheeh by 
    al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, no. 3537. 

    The scholars are unanimously agreed that every loan involving 
    interest or any kind of benefit is haraam. Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have 
    mercy on him) said: Every loan in which it is stipulated that an additional 
    payment be made is haraam, with no scholarly dispute. Ibn al-Mundhir said: 
    They are unanimously agreed that if the lender stipulates that the borrower 
    must pay extra or give a gift, and he gives the loan on this basis, this is 
    riba. It was narrated from Ubayy ibn Ka’b, Ibn ‘Abbaas and Ibn Mas’ood that 
    they forbade loans that lead to any kind of benefit (extra payment, gifts, 
    etc).  Al-Mughni, 6/436. 

    Secondly: 

    With regard to the idea of you renting the house until the 
    loan is paid off, after which it will be yours, this is also haraam. We have 
    already stated in the answer to question no 
    
    (14304) 
    that rent-to-own schemes are haraam. 

    To sum up, this transaction is haraam and it is darkness upon 
    darkness. It is not permissible for a Muslim to take the matter of riba 
    transactions lightly after the stern warning about such transactions has 
    been proven and it has been definitively established that they are haraam. 
    Rather what he must do is to seek that which is halaal, for every body that 
    is nourished by haraam, the Fire is more suited for it. But whoever gives up 
    something for the sake of Allaah, Allaah will compensate him with something 
    better than it. 

    The Standing Committee was asked about the Islamic ruling on 
    taking a loan from a riba-based bank in order to build a modest house. They 
    replied: 
It is haraam to take a 
    loan from banks or elsewhere with riba, whether that is to build something 
    or to spend it on food, clothing or medical expenses or to start a business 
    and earn more money, or any other purpose, because of the general meaning of 
    the verses that forbid riba, and the general meaning of the ahaadeeth which 
    indicate that it is haraam. Similarly it is not permissible to deposit money 
    in banks etc that pay interest.

     And Allaah is the Source of strength. May Allaah send 
    blessing and peace upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.

What do I have to do? I heard some people say that I have to fast three days after that.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Making up missed Ramadaan fasts is a kind of obligatory fast which it is not permissible to break without a legitimate shar’i excuse. If a person starts to observe a fast to make up for a missed fast, then he is obliged to complete it.

If a person breaks a fast that he is observing to make up for a missed Ramadaan fast, he has to make up that day. If he broke that fast with no excuse, then as well as making it up he has to repent to Allaah from this sin. 
With regard to what you mentioned about fasting three days to replace that day, there is no basis for this. 
Rather some of the scholars said that he has to fast two days: the day from Ramadaan and the day he was making up. 
The correct view is that he only has to make up one day. 
Ibn Hazm said in al-Muhalla (6/271): Whoever breaks his fast deliberately when making up a missed Ramadaan fast only has to fast one day, because the obligation to make up the replacement day is not something that was enjoined by Allaah. It was narrated in a saheeh report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) made up that day of Ramadaan so it is not permissible to add anything else to that without any textual evidence or scholarly consensus. 
The Shaykh (may Allaah have mercy on him) was also asked: In the past I fasted some days to make up what I owed, and I broke that fast deliberately, then after that I made up that fast by fasting one day. I do not know whether I should make up one day as I did then or fast for two consecutive months. Do I have to offer expiation (kafaarah)? 
He replied: If a person starts to observe an obligatory fast such as a fast to make up for a day that he missed in Ramadaan, or kafaarat yameen (expiation for breaking an oath), or expiation for shaving during Hajj if he shaved whilst in ihraam before exiting therefrom, or other kinds of obligatory fasts, then it is not permissible for him to break that fast unless he has a legitimate shar’i excuse. The same applies to anyone who starts an obligatory action, he is obliged to complete it and it is not permissible for him to interrupt it without a legitimate shar’i excuse. This woman who started to make up a missed fast then broke her fast with no excuse, then made up that day, does not have to do anything further, because she made up one day for another. But she has to repent and seek Allaah’s forgiveness for what she did by breaking an obligatory fast with no excuse.
