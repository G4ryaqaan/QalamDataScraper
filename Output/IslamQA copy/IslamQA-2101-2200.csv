2102,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2102,Can personal characteristics be changed by du'aa'?,"I would be very grateful to Allah and to our cheikh (jazaahullahu kairan) if he could answer a question that is very important to me. I would like to know whether Allah could answer my prayer if I asked him to change one or more aspects about my personality, which he created in me (jabalani alaihaa), so that it becomes as part of my natural characteristics.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Allah is Able to do all things, and if you pray to Him sincerely, he will answer your du`a. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
 
""And when My slaves ask you concerning Me, then I am indeed near (to them by My Knowledge). I respond to the invocations of the supplicants when he calls on Me (without any mediator or intercessor). So let them obey Me and believe in Me, so that they may be led aright."" [al-Baqarah 2:186]
 
Among the evidence that du`a may have the benefit of eliminating problematic characteristics is the hadeeth of Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her), who said: ""Abu Salamah came to me one day after being with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: 'I heard from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) something that made me very happy. He said, ""There is no calamity that befalls one of the Muslims and he responds by saying 'Innaa Lillaahi wa innaa ilahi raaji'oon (Truly, to Allah we belong, and truly, to Him we shall return),' then he says, 'Allahumma ujurni fi museebati w'ukhluf li khayran minha (O Allah, reward me in this calamity and compensate me with something better than it),' but Allah will do that for him.""'"" Umm Salamah said: ""I learnt this from him, and when Abu Salamah died, I said, 'Innaa Lillaahi wa innaa ilahi raaji'oon,' then , 'Allahumma ujurni fi museebati w'ukhluf li khayran minha,' Then I thought to myself, Where could I find anyone better than Abu Salamah? When my 'iddah (waiting-period) was over, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked permission to see me, whilst I was busy dyeing a hide. I washed the qaraz (a kind of dye derived from a certain plant) from my hands and granted him permission, putting out for him a leather cushion stuffed with palm fibres. He sat down on it, and asked for my hand in marriage. When he had finished what he had to say, I said: 'O Messenger of Allah, I do not want you to lose interest in me, but I am a very jealous woman, and I am afraid that you may see in me something that could earn me the punishment of Allah. I am also a woman who is ageing, and I have children.' He said, 'As for the jealousy you mentioned, Allah will take this away from you (according to another report: as for you saying that you are a jealous woman, I will pray to Allah to take away your jealousy). As for what you say about age, the same applies to me as to you. As for your children, your children are my children.' So I accepted his offer and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) married me. Allah gave me someone even better than Abu Salamah, namely the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).""
 
These two reports are in the Musnad of Imaam Ahmad. The hadeeth was also reported by Muslim from Umm Salamah, who said: ""The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: 'There is no Muslim who suffers a calamity and says what Allah has commanded: ""Innaa Lillaahi wa innaa ilayhi raji'oon, Allahumma ujurni fi museebati w'ukhluf li khayran minha,"" but Allah will compensate him with something better.' When Abu Salamah died, I said, 'Who among the Muslims could be better than Abu Salamah, the first household to migrate to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)?' Then I said [this du`a] and Allah compensated me with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). He sent Haatib ibn Abi Balta'ah on his behalf to ask for my hand in marriage, but I said, 'I have a daughter, and I am a jealous woman.' He said, 'As for your daughter, we will pray to Allah to make her independent, and I will pray to Allah to take away your jealousy.'"" (Reported by Muslim, 1525).
 
I want to tell you, my brother, that the sincere person whose du`as are answered has to be completely honest with Allah in the way he strives to rid himself of bad characteristics and to acquire good characteristics. If you want proof of this, it is to be found in the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): ""Whoever seeks to be patient, Allah will give him patience."" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 1376). He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) also said: ""Knowledge comes by learning and patience comes by making oneself be patient."" (Reported by al-Daraqutni and others; classed as hasan in Saheeh al-Jaami', 2328).
 
Allah has created the means of getting results, so you must pay attention to the laws of Allah that govern His creation. Use the means of acquiring good characteristics and avoiding bad characteristics so that you may get the results you want. You must strive hard and call on Allah. Allah will not betray the hopes of His slaves or cause their hard work and efforts to be lost or wasted.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

    Zinaa (fornication or adultery) is a crime that is forbidden by divine

    condemned those who do this in many aayaat of the Qur’aan and in numerous ahaadeeth
    of His Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). He has threatened those who
    do this with severe punishment and disgrace in this world and the next – except those
    who repent, have faith and do righteous deeds, for Allaah will accept their repentance.
    The gate of repentance is open, but it is a condition of repentance that one should regret
    the deed and give it up. Islam wipes out whatever came before.
With regard to the child, he belongs to his mother, and should not be
    named after his father. This is the ruling concerning the illegitimate child: he should
    not be named after his father because he was conceived in fornication, not in wedlock. It
    is obligatory to take care of this child and bring him up with Islamic manners and morals.
    Because this immoral act has occurred, you must repent from it, but you should cover it up
    and not disclose it; you do not have to tell the people the truth. If the child wants to
    know the truth, you can tell him in an appropriate manner, and let him know that what
    happened was in the days of kufr (before you became Muslim), and that when a person
    repents and becomes Muslim, this wipes out whatever happened before. The child does not
    bear any responsibility for what happened, and as long as his mother has become Muslim,
    there is no grounds for rebuking or punishing her. It is obligatory to accept the will and
    decree of Allaah, and if this child does righteous deeds he will enter Paradise. No soul
    is made to bear the burdens of another. We ask Allaah to keep you safe and sound and to
    forgive you. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

Punishment for homosexuality 


Is homosexuality a sin?","Praise be to Allah.Homosexuality in Malaysia
We do not have any information about homosexuality in Malaysia, but we assume that the Muslims there feel total abhorrence towards this shameful act, because their religion, Islam, emphatically forbids this deed and prescribes a severe punishment for it, in this world and the next. 
How could it be otherwise, when the Prophet of Islam (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ""Whoever you find committing the sin of the people of Lut (Lot), kill them, both the one who does it and the one to whom it is done"" - i.e. if it is done with consent. (This hadith was narrated by al-Tirmidhi in his Sunan, 1376)
Punishment for homosexuality 
The scholars of Islam, such as Malik, al-Shafi'i, Ahmad and Ishaq said that (the person guilty of this crime ) should be stoned, whether he is married or unmarried.
Is homosexuality a sin?
There is no doubt that homosexuality , which goes against the pure human nature created by Allah, by making men content with men and women with women, destroying families, adversely affecting the birth rate, causing the spread of killer diseases, harming the innocent when children are raped, and generally spreading corruption on earth, should be uprooted and stamped out.

2108,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2108,Hands or Knees First When Going to Sujud?,"Regarding prostration in prayer, I have read two different versions. One (on this website) says that it is better that your knees touch the floor before your hands. In the book
The Prophet's Prayer, it says one should place one's hands on the ground before the knees - and quotes hadith supporting this (claiming knees before hand is as the camel and not advisable. Is there a correct way?","Malik, Al-Awza`i and the scholars of Hadith thought that one should go to Sujud hands first, based on the Hadith of Abu Hurayrah who said: The Messenger of Allah said: “When any one of you prostrates, let him not go down as the camel does; let him put his hands down before his knees.”",,"Praise be to Allah.The scholars have differed as to how one should go down in Sujud , whether one should go hands first or knees first. 
According to the Hanafis, Shafi`is and one opinion narrated from Ahmad, the person who is praying should go down on his knees first, then on his hands. 
At-Tirmidhi (may Allah have mercy on him) thought that this was the opinion of the majority of scholars, and said in his Sunan (2/57): 
“This is how it is done according to the majority of scholars: they think that a man should go down on his knees before he puts his hands down, and when he gets up he should raise his hands before his knees. Those who express this opinion take as evidence the Hadith of Wa’il ibn Hijr, who said: I saw the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), when he did Sujud , putting his knees down before his hands, and when he got up he raised his hands before his knees. (Narrated by Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi, At-Nasa’i, Ibn Majah and Ad-Daraqutni, 1/345) 
He said: 
“The only one who narrated it was Yazid ibn Harun from Shurayk. Nobody reported from Asim ibn Kulayb except Shurayk, and Shurayk is not strong. 
Al-Bayhaqi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Sunan (2/101): ‘Its chain of narrators is weak.” Al-Albani classed it as inauthentic in Al-Mishkat (898) and Al-Irwa (2/75)
Other scholars classed it as authentic, such as Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) in Zad Al-Ma`ad). 
Among those who thought that one should go down into Sujud knees first were Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and his student Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on them); contemporary scholars who favour this view include Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz and Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih Al-`Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on them).
Malik, Al-Awza`i and the scholars of Hadith (may Allah have mercy on them) thought that one should go into Sujud hands first, based on the Hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, When any one of you prostrates, let him not go down as the camel does; let him put his hands down before his knees. (Narrated by Ahmad, 2/381, Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi, and An-Nasa’i) 
An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Majmu` (3/421): “It was reported by Abu Dawud and An-Nasa’i with a good chain of narrators.” 
It was classed as authentic by Shaykh Al-Albani in Al-Irwa’ (2/78), who said: This is an authentic chain of narrators, all of whose men are trustworthy, the men of Muslim, apart from Muhammad ibn `Abdullah ibn Al-Hasan, also known as An-Nafs Az-Zakiyyah Al-Alawi, who is trustworthy)
Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) made a valuable comment on this matter in Al-Fatawa (22/449): 
“Praying in both ways is permissible, according to the consensus of the scholars. If a person wants to go down knees first or hands first, his prayer is valid in either case, according to the consensus of the scholars, but they disputed as to which is preferable.”
The scholar should act upon whichever opinion he believes is more likely to be correct, and the ordinary Muslim should follow the opinion of a scholar whom he trusts.

2110,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2110,Authority of the Quran,"I am taking a course on Religions of the World and I am having trouble locating the following answer:
What is the nature of the authority of the Quran according to Orthodox Islamic tradition?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The Quran was revealed by Allah, may He be glorified, as a law and a reference as to what is permissible and prohibited, what is commanded and forbidden, for people to follow, so that they obey its commands and abide by its prohibitions, take what it allows as permissible and take what it prohibits as forbidden. The Quran tells us about what happened before and what is yet to come, and it is a reference for judging between us. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… We have neglected nothing in the Book…” [6:38].
After the Revelation was completed, Allah said (interpretation of the meaning): “… This day, I have perfected your religion for you…” [5:3].
The Sunnah [words and deeds of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)] came to explain and complement the Quran. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I have been given the Quran and something like it with it.” The phrase “something like it with it” refers to the Sunnah. (saheeh/authentic hadeeth).
Allah commanded us to refer to these two constitutional references, when He said (interpretation of the meaning): “…if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allah and His Messenger…” [4:59].

2114,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2114,Evidence for the truth of the Prophethood of Muhammad,"There is a converted christian who does not believe in Quran.
We had many arguments over this issue, still he does not believe in Muhammed being a prophet of God, . I somehow feel that I should help him in knowing the actual truth.
Can you help me regarding this matter.
He Believes in Bible completely and follows it and has memorised it . But is unable to understand the importance of Quran.",,,"Praise be to Allah.First of all, it is essential to understand that guidance to the true religion of Islam and belief in the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the message he brought comes about only by the help of Allah, and that we are required to explain this and produce evidence of it.
There is a great deal of clear evidence for the one who seeks to find out the truth about the Prophethood of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), including the following:


Allah chose him even though he had grown up as an orphan and was illiterate, knowing neither how to read or write. All good qualities and virtues were perfected in him, to the point of ultimate perfection. All these good qualities were combined and firmly established in him, something which no one else can attain except the Prophets whom Allah protected and guided. This combination of perfect qualities is one of the greatest proofs of the truth of his Prophethood (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).


The revelation of Allah was bestowed upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The Angel of Revelation, Jibreel (Gabriel), who is recognized by all the People of the Book [Jews and Christians], came to him, and when he received revelation, there were unusual effects on him that indicated the intensity of the effort involved in receiving the Message of Allah from Jibreel, upon whom be peace. His Companions witnessed this when he received Revelation, and they believed that the revelation was something that came from an outside source and was beyond his control; it came to him from (Allah), the Wise and Praiseworthy.


Allah supported the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) with physical miracles, with which he challenged his people. Among the most important of these were the splitting of the moon and the Night Journey to Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem). They were unable to match these miracles, and so they were a decisive, divine testimony to the truth of his Prophethood (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).


Allah supported him with miracles and evidence for people of reason and understanding, the greatest of which was the Quran. This was the greatest sign, which contains in its pages miracles of both style and content, which all of mankind cannot match or imitate, even if they gather together for that purpose. This is clear from the statements of the most eloquent of the Arabs, who were completely unable to match it. The Quran was – and centuries later still is, praise be to Allah – an eternal miracle as is evident in its brilliant style, its information about the Unseen, its fulfilment of the promises of Allah, the superiority of its laws, and the fact that its rulings are appropriate for every time and place – in addition to the fact that it has such a moving impact on people’s hearts.


The Quran refers to the signs and proofs surrounding the person of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), which testify to his truthfulness. For example, he was free of sin and trivial spitefulness; he grew up illiterate in the Arabian Peninsula, and did not receive any religious knowledge from beyond its borders, nor did he spend time acquiring any religious knowledge. When he reached the age of forty, he brought divine knowledge that none of the earlier or later generations could produce. He also received special protection and care from Allah, which kept him safe at times of crisis; if it were not for this protection he would most certainly have been doomed to destruction. None of this could have happened except to one who was truly sent from Allah.


His coming was foretold in the Tawraat (Torah) and Injeel (Gospel), and some of the People of the Book saw that these prophecies applied in totality to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), which led them to embrace Islam. There are still passages in the Bible, in both the Old and New Testaments, in the versions that are accepted by the People of the Book, that clearly refer to the Prophethood of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) – for example in the Gospel of Barnabas, which is considered by Christians to be the most authentic Gospel.


The Message of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was not unique to him, but was in nature and content similar to the message brought by other Messengers before him. Allah had sent Prophets and Messengers, such as Moosa (Moses), ‘Eesa (Jesus) and others, to the Children of Israel, and great numbers had believed in them and borne witness to the truth of their Books, which were similar in general terms to the message brought by the Quran. This was eloquent testimony to the truth of the Message with which he was sent, especially as it belonged to the same type of Message to whose truth they had testified.


When Allah sent Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) with the same Message as the Prophets who had come before him, the Quran came to confirm their Books and their Prophethood, and to call people to believe in them. So when the People of the Book disbelieved in him and his Book, it meant that they were disbelieving in their own Books and Messengers. As the Quran contained the same principles as their books, and confirmed them, this meant that it was the least likely to be fabricated or to have come from a source other than Allah, because all of them came from Allah, may He be exalted.


In summary, then, the proof of truthfulness is quite clear in this case. The evidence is there both in (historical) reports and on the grounds of common sense. This will cure the ill (i.e., the one who has doubts) and quench the thirst (of the one who longs for knowledge), as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… Indeed, there has come to you from Allah a Light (prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)) and a plain Book (the Quran), wherewith Allah guides all those who seek His Good Pleasure to ways of peace, and He brings them out of darkness by His Will unto light, and guides them to a Straight Way” [al-Maa’idah 5:15-16].
In order to provide the Christian mentioned in the question with proof and evidence, it should be sufficient to give him a translation of the meanings of the Quran. If he believes, then praise be to Allah, and if he turns away, then destroy not yourself in sorrow for him (cf. Faatir 35:8). Allah leaves astray whom He will and guides whom He will, and He is the Most Knowing of Guides.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
2117,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2117,Ruling on organtransplants,"Are you allowed to donate or receive organs, since I have seen no direct prohibition on organ transpants in the Quran.",,,"Praise be to Allah.This subject is one of the topics which is being researched by the Islamic Fiqh Council (Majma’ al-Fiqh al-Islami), which has issued the following fatwaa:


It is permitted to transplant or graft an organ from one part of a person’s body to another, so long as one is careful to ascertain that the benefits of this operation outweigh any harm that may result from it, and on the condition that this is done to replace something that has been lost, or to restore its appearance or regular function, or to correct some fault or disfigurement which is causing physical or psychological distress.


It is permitted to transplant an organ from one person’s body to another, if it is an organ that can regenerate itself, like skin or blood, on the condition that the donor is mature and understands what he is doing, and that all other pertinent shar’i conditions are met.


It is permitted to use part of an organ that has been removed because of illness to benefit another person, such as using the cornea of an eye removed because of illness.


It is haraam to take an organ on which life depends, such as taking a heart from a living person to transplant into another person.


It is haraam to take an organ from a living person when doing so could impair an essential vital function, even though his life itself may not be under threat, such as removing the corneas of both eyes. However, removing organs which will lead to only partial impairment is a matter which is still under scholarly discussion.


It is permitted to transplant an organ from a dead person to a living person whose life depends on receiving that organ, or whose vital functions are otherwise impaired, on the condition that permission is given either by the person before his death or by his heirs, or by the leader of the Muslims in cases where the dead person’s identity is unknown or he has no heirs.


Care should be taken to ensure that there is proper agreement to the transplant of organs in the cases described above, on the condition that no buying or selling of organs is involved. It is not permitted to trade in human organs under any circumstances. But the question of whether the beneficiary may spend money to obtain an organ he needs, or to show his appreciation, is a matter which is still under scholarly debate.


Anything other than the scenarios described above is still subject to scholarly debate, and requires further detailed research in the light of medical research and shar’i rulings.

What are the White Days?","Praise be to Allah.First of all, congratulations on the blessing of Allah which you have received, as He has guided you to this religion and caused you to enjoy the sweetness of obedience and worship through fasting, which is one of the greatest forms of worship. Here we will explain in brief the virtues of fasting.
Virtues of fasting
The virtues of fasting are immense, and a number of sound hadiths state this, such as the following:

Fasting is something which is just for Allah, and Allah will give multiple rewards without measure for it. The hadith says: [Allah says:] Fasting is Mine and it is I Who give reward for it. (Al-Bukhari, Fath, no. 1904)

There is nothing equivalent to fasting. (Al-Nasai, 4/165; see also Sahih al-Targhib, 1/413)

The supplication (du’a) of the fasting person will not be refused. (Reported by al-Bayhaqi, 3/345; see also al-Silsilah al-Sahihah, 1797)
The one who fasts has two joys: the joy of breaking his fast and, when he meets his Lord, the joy of having fasted. (Reported by Muslim, 2/807)
Fasting will be an intercession for the slave on the Day of Resurrection, when it will say: O Lord, I stopped him from eating and drinking during the day, so let me intercede for him. (Reported by Ahmad, 2/174; al-Bayhaqi classed its isnad as hasan in al-Mujtama, 3/181; see also Sahih al-Targhib, 1/411)
The smell (coming from the mouth of) the fasting person is better in the sight of Allah than the scent of musk. (Muslim, 2/808).
Fasting is a protection and a strong fortress against the Fire. (Reported by Ahmad, 2/402; see also Sahih al-Targhib, 1/411 and Sahih al-Jami’, 3880)
Whoever fasts one day for the sake of Allah, Allah will keep his face seventy years distance away from the Fire because of it. (Reported by Muslim, 2/808)
Whoever fasts a day seeking the pleasure of Allah and then dies [i.e. that is the last thing he does] will enter Paradise. (Reported by Ahmad, 5/391; see also Sahih al-Targhib, 1/412)
In Paradise, there is a gate called al-Rayyan, through which those who fast will enter, and no-one else will enter through it. After they have entered, it will be locked and no-one else will enter it. (Al-Bukhari, Fath, no. 1797).
Voluntary fasts will make up for any shortfall in obligatory fasts. Examples of voluntary fasts include ‘Ashura , the Day of ‘Arafah , al-Ayam al-Bid (the White Days), Mondays and Thursdays , six days of Shawwal , and increased fasting during the months of al-Muharram and Sha’ban.

What is meant by al-Ayyam al-Bid is the 13th, 14th, and 15th of each lunar month, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “They ask you about the new moons. Say: These are signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the pilgrimage.” [al-Baqarah 2:189] 
So the timing of certain acts of worship and the ‘iddah (waiting period for women who have been divorced or widowed, etc.) are worked out according to the lunar months of the Hijri or Islamic calendar, not the solar months of the Gregorian or Western calendar. 
The fasts which you have observed according to the solar calendar most likely do not correspond with the lunar calendar, but in any case you will be rewarded, in sha Allah, for the days that you have fasted, because you have fasted them voluntarily for the sake of Allah. But if you wish to earn the reward that is specifically for fasting Ayyam al-Bid, which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) urged us to do, you should find out the timings according to the lunar calendar and fast according to it.
We ask Allah to increase His blessings upon you, to help you adhere to His religion, to give you the strength to do that which will please Him and to increase your reward, for He is the All-Hearing Who answers prayers. Do not forget us in your prayers whilst you are fasting. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

I am a female Muslim, and I want to know if my older brother is acceptable for this role.","Conditions of the wali are as follows: He should be of sound mind, an adult, free (not a slave), of the same religion as the bride, of good character, be male, be wise and mature.","Pillars of marriage in Islam


Conditions of marriage in Islam


Conditions of the wali


Order of who can take the role of the wali","Praise be to Allah.Pillars of marriage in Islam
There are three pillars or conditions for the marriage contract in Islam:

Both parties should be free of any obstacles that might prevent the marriage from being valid, such as their being mahrams of one another (i.e., close relatives who are permanently forbidden to marry), whether this relationship is through blood ties or through breastfeeding etc., or where the man is a non-Muslim and the woman is a Muslim, and so on.
There should be an offer or proposal (ijab) from the wali or the person who is acting in his place, who should say to the groom “I marry so-and-so to you” or similar words.
There should be an expression of acceptance (qabul) on the part of the groom or whoever is acting in his place, who should say, “I accept,” or similar words.

Conditions of marriage in Islam
The conditions of a proper marriage contract are as follows:

Both the bride and groom should be clearly identified, whether by stating their names or describing them, etc. 
Both the bride and groom should be pleased with one another, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No previously-married woman (widow or divorcee) may be married until she has been asked about her wishes (i.e., she should state clearly her wishes), and no virgin should be married until her permission has been asked (i.e., until she has agreed either in words or by remaining silent).” They asked, “O Messenger of Allah, how is her permission given (because she will feel very shy)?” He said: “By her silence.” (Reported by al-Bukhari, 4741)
The one who does the contract on the woman’s behalf should be her wali, as Allah addressed the walis with regard to marriage (interpretation of the meaning): “And marry those among you who are single…” [al-Nur 24:32] and because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Any woman who marries without the permission of her wali, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid.” (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 1021 and others; it is a sound hadith)

The marriage contract must be witnessed , as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no marriage contract except with a wali and two witnesses.” (Reported by al-Tabarani; see also Sahih al-Jami’, 7558) 
Conditions of the wali
The conditions of the wali are as follows:

He should be of sound mind
He should be an adult
He should be free (not a slave)
He should be of the same religion as the bride. A non-Muslim cannot be the wali of a Muslim , male or female, and a Muslim cannot be the wali of a kafir, male or female, but a non-Muslim can be the wali of a non-Muslim woman for marriage purposes, even if they are of different religions. An apostate (one who has left Islam) cannot be a wali for anybody.
He should be of good character (‘adalah – includes piety, attitude, conduct, etc.), as opposed to being corrupt. This is a condition laid down by some scholars, although some of them regard the outward appearance of good character as being sufficient, and some say that it is enough if he is judged as being able to pay proper attention to the interests of the woman for whom he is acting as wali in the matter of her marriage.
He should be male, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No woman may conduct the marriage contract of another woman, and no woman can conduct the marriage contract on behalf of her own self, because the zaniyah (fornicatress, adulteress) is the one who arranges things on her own behalf.” (Reported by Ibn Majah, 1782; see also Sahih al-Jami’, 7298)

He should be wise and mature, which means being able to understand matters of compatibility and the interests of marriage.
Order of who can take the role of the wali
The jurists put possible walis in a certain order, and a wali who is more closely-related should not be ignored unless there is no such person or the relatives do not meet the specified conditions. 

A woman’s wali is her father, 
then whoever her father may have appointed before his death, 
then her paternal grandfather or great-grandfather,
then her son, then his sons or grandsons, 
then her brother through both parents (full brother), 
then her brother through her father, 
then the sons of her brother through both parents, 
then the sons of her brother through her father, 
then her uncle (her father’s brother through both parents),
then her father’s brother through the father,
then the sons of her father’s brother though both parents, 
then the sons of her father’s brother through the father, 
then whoever is more closely related, and so on – as is the case with inheritance. 
The Muslim leader (or his deputy, such as a judge) is the wali for any woman who does not have a wali of her own.

2128,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2128,Buying a house through the bank,Is it permissible to obtain a fixed rate mortgage from a british bank in order to purchase a house.,,,"Praise be to Allah.If the bank owns the house, then it is permissible for it to sell it to you for a fixed price, whether payment is deferred or made in installments, even if this will cost more than paying the full price for it immediately. This is according to the more sound opinion among the scholars.
But if the bank is involved in this transaction as the supplier or lender of funds, which you then have to repay with some extra, then this is clearly an interest-based transaction, which is undoubtedly haraam.
It may be almost impossible to avoid interest-based transactions when dealing with real estate in many countries, and one may hardly be able to find any halaal alternative, but the Muslim must bear this with patience and seek out halaal means. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): And whosoever fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (of every difficulty). And He will provide for him from (sources) he could never imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allah will accomplish his purpose.

    (guardian) of the bride and acceptance (qabool) on the part of the groom, with the
    consent of the bride, in front of two Muslim witnesses of good character (as regards
    piety, attitude, conduct, etc.), then the marriage contract is valid. Ibn Qudaamah (may

    are two Muslim witnesses, regardless of whether the bride and groom are both Muslims or
    only the groom is. This is what Ahmad stated, and it is also the opinion of

The Islamic Fiqh Council has researched the matter of dealing in bonds and issued the following statement:


Bonds which represent a commitment to pay the face value plus interest, or conditional benefits, are haraam according to sharee’ah, whether one is buying, selling or handling them, because they are considered to be interest-based loans. This applies whether they are issued by private companies or by public bodies run by the state. The fact that they are forbidden is not affected by giving them other names such as “certificates”, “investment documents” or “savings”, or calling the interest “profit”, “commission” or “returns”.


Also forbidden are bonds that offer prizes, because these are loans made on the condition that the benefits or increase will go to the group loaning the money, or to one of them, who is not specified at the time of investment, in addition to the fact that this is based on the idea of gambling.

Treatment of cases where recovery is hopeless 


Should we seek the patient’s permission to give him medication?","Praise be to Allah.Is it permissible to seek medication?
The governing principle is that it is allowed to seek medication because of what has been narrated to this effect in the Quran and Sunnah, i.e., the words and deeds of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and because it involves saving lives, which is one of the overall aims of Shari`ah.
The rulings governing the issue of seeking medication differ according to the circumstances and people involved:

Seeking medication is obligatory in cases where not giving medication could cause death, disability or the loss of a limb, or where the sickness is bound to spread if not treated, as in contagious diseases.
It is encouraged in cases where not giving medication may weaken a person physically, and it is not as bad as the cases mentioned above.
It is allowed in cases which are not covered in the two preceding categories.
It is discouraged in cases where the treatment could lead to complications that are worse than the original complaint.

Treatment of cases where recovery is hopeless 

The Muslim believes that disease and cure are matters that are under the control of Allah, may He be glorified. Treatment and medication are ways of utilizing the laws of cause and effect that Allah has incorporated into the running of the universe.  It is not permitted to despair of the mercy of Allah – there should always be the hope of healing by the permission of Allah.  The doctors and families should try to raise the morale of those who are sick and continue their efforts to relieve the mental and physical suffering of the patient regardless of whether a cure is expected or not.
Deeming a situation to be hopeless is based only on doctors’ opinions, the state of medical science in any given time or place, and the circumstances of the patient himself.

Should we seek the patient’s permission to give him medication?

Seeking the patient’s permission depends on whether he is qualified to give it (i.e., he should be of sound mind, mature, and responsible). If this is not the case, then the permission of his guardian should be sought, within the limits set by Shari`ah which requires the guardian to take care of a person’s interests and protect him from harm. No attention should be paid to the guardian’s refusal to give permission if this is obviously going to harm the person. In this case, guardianship has to be transferred to another guardian, or to the Muslim leader.
The Muslim leader has the right to force medication in certain situations, such as a case of contagious disease, or the giving of vaccines or when taking preventive measures to control the spread of diseases.
In an emergency where lives are at stake, treatment can be administered without waiting for permission or consent.
When carrying out medical research, there must be total agreement on the part of suitably qualified subjects, with no element of compulsion (such as using prisoners for research) or financial compulsion (such as using the poor), and no harm must result from this research.  It is not permitted to carry out medical research on people who are unable to give their consent, even if their guardians agree to it.",Islam Q&A

If the purchaser doesn’t buy the product, the vendor keeps the deposit. It is classified under the heading of “sales and rentals”, because it is the sale of the benefits of the product.

There are certain cases in which making a down-payment is not permitted, such as forward buying (bay’ al-salam) [???], and the sale of money for money, and of gold and silver, because in all these cases the whole amount must be handed over at the time of drawing up the contract. Sales on the basis of a down-payment are not permitted in these cases.
Sales involving down-payments are permitted if a specific waiting-period is stipulated, and both parties agree that the down-payment will be counted as part of the price if the sale is completed, and that the vendor will keep the down-payment if the purchaser changes his mind.

He said, “Who will buy this rug and cup?” A man said, “I’ll take them for a dirham,” and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Who will offer more than a dirham?

This hadith was narrated by al-Mu’tamir ibn Sulaymaan and by more than one of the prominent people from al-Akhdar ibn ‘Ajlaan.
There follows a definition of this kind of sale, and some of the regulations that apply to it:


The contract: an auction is a commutative contract or exchange, based on a call issued vocally or in writing to invite interested parties to take part in the auction. The contract is concluded when the seller is satisfied.


The actual contract may vary according to whether it is the matter of selling or leasing, etc, and according to the nature of the auction – it may be voluntary, like the regular kind of auction held among individuals, or required by law, such as auctions ordered by a judge. Auctions required by law may be held by public and private institutions, and government bodies, as well as individuals.


Any procedures involved in the auction – such as paperwork, regulations and administrative and legal conditions – should not contradict the rules of Islamic sharee’ah.


Requiring a deposit from everyone who wants to come in is permissible according to sharee’ah, but it should be returned to anyone who does not buy anything, and should be counted as part of the purchase price for those who do buy.


According to sharee’ah, there is nothing wrong with charging an entry fee to cover the costs of producing booklets listing regulations, etc., so long as it is not more than the actual cost.


Artificially inflating prices is haraam. This may take the following forms:



a person who has no intention of buying may inflate the price to tempt the buyer to offer more

a person who has no intention of buying may pretend to like the product and to know a lot about it, and may praise it highly, to tempt the buyer to offer more


the vendor, his agent or the auctioneer may make false claims about how much was paid for the product, in order to mislead the one who is thinking of buying


modern forms of this forbidden inflation of prices include the use of audio-visual and written means to list fine qualities that do not exist in reality, or to raise the price so as to tempt the buyer and impel him to complete the transaction

    medical profession","What is a secret? And what are the
      rulings governing secrets in a specific profession dealing with secret or confidential
      issues, such as medicine?",,,"Praise be to Allah.A secret is something which one person discloses to another and asks him
        not to tell anyone else. This includes situations where it is obvious that the matter
        should not be disclosed, such as when a man looks around to make sure that there is nobody
        listening to what he is saying, and so on, as well as private and embarrassing matters
        that no-one would like everyone to know about.

A secret is a trust for which the person who has been asked to keep it
        is responsible. This is in accordance with both the teachings of Islam and the
        requirements of chivalry and good manners.

In general, secrets should not be disclosed and spreading secrets
        without a good reason is considered to be subject to the disapproval of sharee’ah.

The duty to keep secrets applies even more to people working in
        professions where disclosure of secrets could reflect badly on the profession itself, as
        is the case in the medical profession, where people come to practitioners to seek advice
        and ask for help, and so they have to tell them everything that may help them to do their
        job properly, including matters which they may not disclose to anyone else, even their
        closest family members.

The obligation to keep secrets does not apply in cases where concealing
        something may lead to a greater harm that outweighs any harm feared as a result of
        revealing it. Such situations are of two types:

Cases where a secret has to be revealed on the grounds of choosing the
          lesser of two evils in order to avoid greater harm, and allowing harm to befall an
          individual for the sake of the general good. Such cases are of two types: 

Where the good of an entire society is at stake 

Where the good of an individual is at stake

Cases where it is permissible to reveal a secret because

This is in the interests of society as a whole

This will protect society from harm

In all these situations, strict attention must be paid to the aims and
    priorities of sharee’ah, which are to protect Islam, lives, minds, lineages and
    wealth.","Majma’ al-Fiqh al-Islami, p. 180"

What is the ruling on this?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Nowadays there is something known as the trade in foetuses, in which some doctors deliberately abort foetuses so that they can profit from selling the foetal organs or cells, from which some kinds of injections may be prepared for the benefit of elderly rich people and others. This is a major crime, because it entails the deliberate murder of innocent souls for financial gain. This is a serious form of wrongdoing and the rulings concerning it are well known and obvious. The question of whether the aborted foetus may be used as a source of transplant organs has been researched by the Islamic Fiqh Council, which issued the following fatwaa:


It is not permitted to exploit foetuses as a source of organs needed for transplant into another person except in certain limited circumstances under stringent conditions.




It is not permitted to deliberately induce abortion for the purpose of exploiting the foetus for organ transplants to another person. Only foetuses expelled through natural or spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) or aborted for a legitimate reason may be used in this way. Surgery should not be performed to remove the foetus except in cases where the mother’s life is at risk.


If the aborted foetus is viable and capable of living, then medical attention should be aimed at preserving its life, not at exploiting it for organ transplant. If it is not viable and will not live, its organs cannot be used until after it has died naturally, according to the conditions of sharee’ah.




It is not permissible to exploit any part of the procedures required to obtain and transplant organs for commercial gain.


The procedures surrounding organ transplants must be supervised and regulated by a specialized and trustworthy organization.

    that causes sterility","What is the ruling on operations that
      prevent pregnancy?",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permitted to carry out operations on 
  men or women that will lead to complete sterility, such as cutting the vas deferens 
  (vasectomy) in men, or removing the ovaries or womb (hysterectomy) in women. 
  This is because cutting off all possibility of future offspring with no valid 
  reason is haraam, as it goes against what the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings 
  of Allaah be upon him) wanted for his ummah, and is a source of shame and humiliation 
  for the Muslims. The more the Muslims increase in number, the more this is a 
  source of pride and status for them. Allaah has guaranteed to provide for His 
  slaves, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): “And no living, 
  moving creature is there on earth but its provision is due from Allaah. And 
  He knows its dweeling place and its deposit (in the uterus, grave, etc.). All 
  is in a Clear Book.” [Hood 11:6]. So cutting 
  off all possibility of future offspring for no good reason goes against this 
  teaching. However, if it is necessary to carry out an operation of the kind 
  mentioned – such as a case where the mother’s life will be in danger 
  if she becomes pregnant, or she is suffering from a disease in her womb which 
  it is feared could spread and kill her (such as cancer), so she has no choice 
  but to have her womb removed – then there is nothing wrong with carrying 
  out these operations in such cases of necessity. And Allaah knows best.

The fact that the kaafirs will be singled out for hardship on the Day of Resurrection indicates that it will be easy for the believers.
The words (interpretation of the meaning), “Truly, that Day will be a hard Day, far from easy for the disbelievers.” [al-Muddaththir 74:9-10] also indicate that it will be easy, not difficult, for the believers. This is also indicated by the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): “Hastening towards the caller, the disbelievers will say, ‘This is a hard Day.’” [al-Qamar 54:8]. This means that the Day of Resurrection will be long for the kuffaar and short for the Muslims.
Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has mentioned in His Book the length of time the reckoning will take on the Day of Resurrection. He said (interpretation of the meaning): “Those who have earned the Garden [Paradise] on that day will be better in their home and happier in their place of noonday rest” [al-Furqaan 25:24 – Pickthall’s translation]. This aayah indicates that the reckoning will be completed in half a day, because al-maqeel (translated as “noonday rest”) refers to a siesta or rest from the heat of mid-day.
Among those who said that the reckoning will be completed in half a day are Ibn ‘Abbaas, Ibn Mas’ood, ‘Ikrimah and Ibn Jubayr, because this is what is indicated by this aayah, as was reported by Ibn Katheer and others.
(Daf’ Ayhaam al-Idtiraab by al-Shanqeeti, p. 172).
Another clear indication that the reckoning of the believer on the Day of Resurrection will be easy is the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah who reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “For the believers, the (length of) the Day of Resurrection will be like the time between Zuhr and ‘Asr.”

2182,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/2182,Ruling on one who neglects prayer,"The saheeh ahaadeeth state clearly that the one who neglects prayer is a kaafir. If we take the hadeeth at face value, it appears that we are obliged to deprive the person who neglects prayer deliberately of all his rights of inheritance, a separate cemetery should be allocated for such people, and we cannot pray for them or greet them with salaam, because there is no greeting of peace for a kaafir. Let us not forget that if we were to calculate the number of men, believers and non-believers alike, who pray, we will find it is only 6%, and among women the number is even less. What does Islam have to say about this? What is the ruling about giving or returning the greeting of salaam to one who neglects prayer?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The scholars have differed concerning the Muslim who deliberately neglects salaah without denying that it is obligatory. Some of them say that he is definitely a kaafir who has gone beyond the pale of Islam. He is considered to be a murtadd (apostate) who is to be given three days to repent – if he does not, he is to be executed for his apostasy. The funeral prayer will not be recited over him, and he will not be buried in the Muslim graveyard. The greeting of salaam is not to be given to him, in life or in death, and his greeting is not to be returned; prayers for forgiveness and mercy for him cannot be offered; he cannot inherit, neither can his wealth be inherited, instead it is to be given to the Muslim treasury (bayt al-maal). This ruling applies whether the number of people who are neglecting their prayers are many or a few.
This opinion is the soundest and most correct, because of the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “The difference between us and them is salaah. Whoever neglects it is a kaafir.”
(Reported by Imaam Ahmad and the authors of Sunan with a saheeh isnaad); and: “(Nothing stands) between a man and kufr and shirk, except prayer: (whoever neglects it becomes a kaafir and a mushrik).” (Reported by Imaam Muslim in his Saheeh, with other similar ahaadeeth).
The majority of scholars said that if a person denies that prayer is obligatory, he is a kaafir and an apostate from the religion of Islam. The ruling concerning such a person is as described above. If he does not deny that it is obligatory, but he neglects it because of laziness, for example, then he is guilty of a major sin (kabeerah), but he is not considered to be beyond the pale of Islam. He should be given three days in which to repent. If he does, then al-hamdu lillah (praise be to Allaah); if he does not, then he should be executed, but this is a punishment, not because he became a kaafir. In this case, he should be washed (ghusl, after death) and wrapped in a shroud (kafn). The funeral prayer should be offered for him, prayers can be offered for forgiveness and mercy for him, and he should be buried in the Muslim graveyard. He can inherit and be inherited from.

    until it begins to appear over the horizon). When you pray Zuhr, its time is until

    this matter of ours [Islam] that is not part of it will have it rejected.” (Narrated

    (Reported by Abu Dawood and al-Tirmidhi, who said, it is a saheeh hasan hadeeth. )
    And we should remember the hadeeth of Abu ‘Umayr ibn Anas from his uncles among the
    Ansaar. He said: the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was
    concerned about how to call the people together to pray. Someone suggested raising a flag
    when the time for prayer came, so that when they saw it they could call one another, but
    he did not like this idea. Someone mentioned a ram’s horn, like the shofar, but he
    did not like this idea, and said, “That belongs to the Jews.” A bell was
    suggested, but he said, “That belongs to the Christians.” ‘Abd-Allaah ibn
    Zayd ibn ‘Abd Rabbihi went away, thinking about this matter that was of concern to
    the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Then he saw the
    Adhaan in a dream, and he came to the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him) the next day and told him about it. The Messenger of Allaah 
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “O Bilaal, go and see what
    ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Zayd wants you to do, then do it.” So Bilaal called the Adhaan.
    Reported by Abu Dawood, 420; this is a saheeh hadeeth.
    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) rejected the ram’s horn

“O you who believe! Verily, the Mushrikûn (polytheists) are Najasun (impure). So let them not come near Al-Masjid Al-Harâm (at Makkah) after this year” [al-Tawbah 9:28].
With regard to other mosques, some fuqaha’ said that it is permissible because there is nothing to indicate that it is not allowed; others said that it is not permissible, by analogy with al-Masjid al-Haram.
The correct view is that it is permissible if it serves the interests of sharee’ah or meet a valid need, such as a person hearing something that may invite him to enter Islam, or because he needs to drink water in the mosque, or the like. This is because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) tied up (his prisoner) Thamaamah ibn Athaal al-Hanafi in the mosque before he became Muslim, and the delegations of Thaqeef and the Christians of Najraan stayed in the mosque before they became Muslim. There were many benefits offered by doing this: they could hear the speeches and sermons of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), see people praying and reciting Qur’aan, and other benefits that are gained by those who visit the mosque.

Among the evidence that it is permissible to turn the places of worship of shirk and kufr into mosques is the following hadeeth: From Talq ibn ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him): “We went out as a delegation to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).

We called the adhaan there, and when the monk, a man from Tayyi’, heard it, he said, ‘The call of truth!’ then he climbed one of our hills and we never saw him again.” (Reported by al-Nasaa’i, 694). And Allah knows best.
The building itself does not need to be destroyed so long as its roof, walls etc. can be put to use and architectural alterations can be made, after removing all the symbols of Shirk and other forbidden things, so that the structure of the building will match the rows of prayer, facing the direction of the Ka’bah.

    to do so, and it is permitted for those men to look at them, provided that this do not go
    beyond the bounds of what is necessary, because what is permitted on the grounds of
    necessity should not be exaggerated.
These special situations may be summed up as follows:
I – Proposal of marriage
It is permitted for a woman to uncover her face and hands in front of a
    man who wants to propose to her, so that he may see them, without being alone with her and
    without touching her, because the face gives an indication of ugliness or beauty, and the
    hands give an indication of whether the body is slender or plump (which in turn gives an
    impression about fertility).
Abu’l-Faraj al-Maqdisi said: “The scholars do not differ as
    to the permissibility of looking at the face… the focal point of beauty, the place
    one looks at…”
Many ahaadeeth indicate that it is permissible for a man to look at the
    woman to whom he is proposing marriage. Among them are the following:
Sahl ibn Sa’d (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “A woman
        came to the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said,
        ‘O Messenger of Allaah, I came to give myself to you in marriage.’ So the
        Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) looked at her, he raised
        his gaze and stared at her, then he lowered his head. When the woman saw that he had not
        made any decision, she sat down. Then a man from among his Companions stood up and said,
        ‘O Messenger of Allaah, if you don’t want to marry her, then marry her to
        me.’ …” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 7/19; Muslim, 4/143;
        al-Nisaa’i bi Sharh al-Suyooti, 6/113; al-Bayhaqi, 7/84).
      
      
      Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “I was with the
        Prophet 
, and a man came to him and told him that he had married a woman of the Ansaar.
        The Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, ‘Have you
        looked at her?’ He said, ‘No.’ He said, ‘Go and look at her, for there
        is something in the eyes of the Ansaar.’” (Reported by Ahmad, 2/286, 299;
        Muslim, 4/142; al-Nisaa’i, 2/73).
      
      
      Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of
        Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When any one of you
        proposes marriage to a woman, if he can look at that which will encourage him to go ahead
        and marry her, let him do so.” (Reported by Abu Dawood and al-Haakim. Its
        isnaad is hasan, and there is corroborating evidence in the hadeeth of Muhammad ibn
        Muslimah. It was classed as saheeh by Ibn Hibbaan and al-Haakim. It was also reported by
        Ahmad and Ibn Maajah, and by Ahmad and al-Bazzaar from the hadeeth of Abu Humayd. Fath
        al-Baari, 9/181).
      
    
    Al-Zayla’i said: “It is not permissible for
    him to touch her face or hands – even if he feels that no desire will be aroused by
    doing so – because it is haraam and there is no need to do so.” In Durar
    al-Bihaar it says: “It is not permissible for the qaadi, the witnesses or the
    groom to touch her, even if they feel that no desire will be aroused by doing so, because
    there is no need for that.” (Radd al-Muhtaar ‘ala’l-Durr
    al-Mukhtaar, 5/237).
    Ibn Qudaamah said: “It is not permitted for him to
    be alone with her because she is still forbidden for him, and only a look is permitted,
    therefore being alone with her remains haraam, because there is no guarantee that he will
    not do something haraam if he is alone with her. The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him) said: “No man is alone with a [non-mahram] woman but the Shaytaan
    is the third one present with them.” He should not look at her in a lustful or
    suspicious manner. Ahmad said, according to a report narrated by Saalih: “He should
    look at the face, and he should not look in a lustful manner.”
The man may look at her repeatedly, checking her features, because the
    desired aim cannot be achieved in any other way.”
II – Business dealings
It is permitted for a woman to uncover her face and hands when buying
    or selling, and it is permitted for the vendor to see her face when he hands over the
    goods and asks for the money, provided that this will not lead to fitnah – otherwise
    it is forbidden.
Ibn Qudaamah said: “If a person deals with a woman when selling or
    renting, he may look at her face so he knows who she is, and may go back to her when the
    money is due (a guarantee of the price when the deal is finalized). It was reported that
    Ahmad said this was makrooh in the case of a young woman, but not in the case of an old
    woman, and in the case where there is fear of fitnah, or where there is no need for this
    business deal. But in cases where it is necessary, and there is no wrongful desire, then
    there is no harm in it.” (al-Mughni, 7/459; al-Sharh al-Kabeer ‘ala
    Matan al-Muqni’, 7/348 bi Haamish al-Mughni; al-Hidaayah ma’a
    Takmilat Fath al-Qadeer, 10/24).
    Al-Dasooqi said: “ When testimony is given
    concerning a woman who wears niqaab (face-veil), she has to remove her niqaab. This
    applies in the case of marriage and other matters, such as selling, giving gifts, debts,
    power of attorney, and so on. This is the opinion favoured by our shaykh.” (Haashiyat
    al-Dasooqi ‘ala’l-Sharh al-Kabeer, 4/194).
    III – Medical treatment
A woman is permitted to uncover the site of her illness whether it is
    on her face or elsewhere on her body, for a male doctor to treat her, on the condition
    that her husband or mahram is present, and if she cannot find a female doctor. It is less
    serious for her to be seen by a doctor of the same sex, and she should not be seen by a
    non-Muslim doctor if a Muslim doctor is available. Also, she should not uncover more than
    the site of the problem.
It is not permissible for the doctor to look at or touch more than is
    necessary, because the issue is one of necessity and should not be exaggerated.
Ibn Qudaamah said: “it is permissible for the doctor to look at
    whatever is necessary of her body, of her private parts and elsewhere, because there is a
    need for it to be uncovered.
It was reported that a boy who had stolen something was brought to
    ‘Uthmaan. He said, ‘Look at his groin (to see if he had pubic hair, which would
    indicate whether he had reached the age of puberty [and would therefore be considered to
    be a responsible adult] or not).’ They did not find any pubic hair, so they did not
    cut off his hand.” (Al-Mughni, 7/459; Ghidha’ al-Albaab,
    1/97).
    Ibn ‘Aabideen said: “He said in al-Jawharah:
    if the illness is in any part of her body apart from her private part, it is permitted
    (for the doctor) to look at it in order to treat it, because it is the matter of
    necessity. If the sickness is in her private part, he (the doctor) should teach a woman
    how to treat it. If there is nobody who can do that, and they fear that she may die or
    suffer unbearably, then they should cover all of her body except the site of the sickness,
    then a man may treat her, but he should avoid looking at her as much as he can, and look
    only at the site of the sickness that he is treating.” (Radd al-Muhtaar,
    5/237. See also, al-Hidaayah al-‘Alaa’iyah, p. 245).
    A similar ruling applies to one who is taking care of a
    sick person, even if it is someone of the opposite sex, when helping the patient with
    wudoo’ or istinja’ (washing the private parts after using the toilet). (See
    Ghidha’ al-Albaab, 1/97).
    Muhammad Fu’aad said: “What indicates that it
    is permissible for a man to treat a woman – within the restrictions mentioned above
    – is the report narrated by Imaam al-Bukhaari with his isnaad from al-Rabee’
    bint Mu’awwadh, who said: “We used to go out on military campaigns with the
    Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). We would bring water to
    the people and serve them, and bring the dead and wounded back to Madeenah.” (Reported
    by al-Bukhaari, 6/80, 10/136. Fath al-Baari. A similar report was narrated from
    Anas by Muslim, 5/196; Abu Dawood, 7/205 ma’a ‘Awn al-Ma’bood;
    and al-Tirmidhi, 5/301-302, who said this is hasan saheeh)
    Al-Bukhaari included this hadeeth under the chapter
    heading Baab hal yudaawi’l-rajul ul-mar’ah wa’l-mar’at ul-rajul?
    (Chapter: can a man treat a woman or a woman a man?). (Fath al-Baari,
    10/136).
    Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said: “The ruling that a man
    may treat a woman was derived from this by analogy; he (al-Bukhaari) did not confirm that,
    because it is possible that this referred to the time before hijaab was made obligatory,
    or that women used to take care of their husbands or mahrams on military campaigns. The
    ruling is that it is permissible for women to treat non-mahram men in cases of necessity,
    with as little looking and touching as possible.” (Fath al-Baari,
    10/136)
    IV – Testimony
It is permissible for a woman to uncover her face when she is giving
    testimony in court, whether she is a witness in a case or is there to witness a deal, and
    it is permissible for the qaadi (judge) to look at her in order to know who she is and to
    protect the rights of all concerned.
Shaykh al-Dardeer said: “It is not permitted to give testimony
    against a woman in niqaab until she uncovers her face so that it may be known who she is
    and what she looks like.” (Al-Sharh al-Kabeer li’l- Shaykh al-Dardeer,
    4/194)
    Ibn Qudaamah said: “The witness may look at the
    face of the woman against whom he is testifying so that his testimony will speak about her
    in specific terms. Ahmad said: ‘He cannot testify against a woman unless he knows who
    she is.’” (Al-Mughni, 7/459; al-Sharh al-Kabeer ‘ala Matan
    al-Muqni’, 7/348, bi haamish al-Mughni; al-Hidaayah ma’a Takmilat
    Fath al-Qadeer, 10/26).
    V – In court cases
It is permissible for a woman to uncover her face in front of a qaadi
    (judge) who is to rule either in her favour or against her, and in this situation he may
    look at her face in order to know who she is and for the sake of protecting people’s
    rights.
The same rules that apply to giving testimony or bearing witness also
    apply in court cases, because they serve the same purpose. (See Al-Durar
    al-Mukhtaar, 5/237; Al-Hadiyah al-‘Alaa’iyah, p. 244; Al-Hadiyah
    ma’a Takmilat Fath al-Qadeer, 10/26).
    VI – In front of mature boys who feel no physical
    desire
It is permissible – according to one of the two reports – for
    a woman to show in front of a mature boy who feels no physical desire what she shows in
    front of her mahrams, because he has no interest in women, and it is permissible for him
    to see all that. 
Shaykh Abu’l-Faraj al-Maqdisi said: “The mature boy who feels
    no physical desire may see parts of a woman’s body above the navel and below the
    knee, according to one of the two reports, because Allaah says (interpretation of the
    meanings): ‘… there is no sin on you or on them to move about, - attending
    (helping) you each other…’ [al-Noor 24:58] and ‘And when the
    children among you come to puberty, then let them (also) ask for permission, as those
    senior to them (in age)…’ [al-Noor 24:59]. This indicates that there is a
    differentiation between those who have reached puberty and those who have not.”
Abu ‘Abd-Allaah said: “Abu Tayyibah did cupping for the wives
    of the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when he was a boy.”
It was also reported that he said: “He is like the ajnabi
    (stranger, i.e., non-mahram), because he is like one who has reached puberty in the matter
    of physical desires, and this means that hijaab is required and it is forbidden to look.
    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘… small children who have no
    sense of the shame of sex…’ [al-Noor 24:31]. As for small boys who are not
    mature, it is not necessary to cover in front of them at all.” (Al-Sharh
    al-Kabeer ‘ala Matan al-Muqni’, 7/349. See also Al-Mughni, 7/458 and
    Ghada’ al-Albaab, 1/97).
    VII – The man who has no desire
It is permissible for a woman to show in front of a man who has no
    desire what she can show in front of her mahrams, because he has no interest in women, and
    he is allowed to see all of that. Ibn Qudaamah said: “Whoever no longer feels any
    desire, because of old age, impotence or incurable illness, or because he is a eunuch,
    … or a mukhannath (the effeminate man or a man who has female hormones) who feels no
    desire, the ruling that applies to such a man is the same as the ruling that applies to
    mahrams regarding looking at women, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘…
    or old male servants who lack vigour…’ [al-Noor 24:31], i.e., those who feel
    no desire for women.” Ibn ‘Abbaas said: “This is the one of whom women do
    not feel shy.” He also said: “This is the mukhannath who is impotent (i.e.,
    cannot have an erection).”
It was reported that Mujaahid and Qutaadah said: “This is the one
    who has no interest in women, but if he is a mukhannath who feels desire and knows about
    women, then the rules that apply to others apply also to him, because ‘Aa’ishah
    said: ‘A mukhannath entered upon the wives of the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of
    Allaah be upon him), and they used to think that he was a man who felt no physical
    desires, but the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) entered upon us when
    this man was describing a woman and saying ‘When she comes in, she comes on four, and
    when she goes out, she goes on eight.’ The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be
    upon him) said: ‘Do I not see that this man knows who is here? This one should never
    enter upon you.’ And he was kept away after that.” (Reported by Abu Dawood and
    others). 
Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said: “The mukhannath is not only the one
    who is known to be promiscuous. The mukhannath is the one who looks so much like a woman
    physically that he resembles women in his softness, speech, appearance, accent and
    thinking. If he is like this, he would have no desire for women and he would not notice
    anything about them. This is one of those who have no interest in women who were permitted
    to enter upon women. Do you not see that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be
    upon him) did not prevent that mukhannath from entering upon his wives at first, but when
    he heard him describing the daughter of Ghaylaan and realized that he knew about women, he
    commanded that he should be kept away.” (Al-Mughni, 7/463; al-Sharh
    al-Kabeer ‘ala Matan al-Muqni’, 7/347-348).
    IX – Old women who are past marriageable age
Old women who are past marriageable age may uncover their faces and
    what usually appears in front of non-mahram men, but it is still better for them to remain
    covered.
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And as for women
    past child-bearing who do not expect wedlock, it is no sin on them if they discard their
    (outer) clothing in such a way as not to show their adornment. But to refrain (i.e., not
    to discard their outer clothing) is better for them…” [al-Noor 24:60]. Ibn
    Qudaamah said: “In the case of old women who are past marriageable age, there is
    nothing wrong if they show what ordinarily appears, because Allaah says (interpretation of
    the meaning), ‘And as for women past child-bearing who do not expect
    wedlock…’ [al-Noor 24:60].” Ibn ‘Abbaas said concerning the aayahs
    (interpretation of the meanings), “Tell the believing men to lower their
    gaze…” [al-Noor 24:30] and “Tell the believing women to lower their
    gaze…” [al-Noor 24:31]: “Old women who no longer expect to get married
    were exempted from this. The same exemption also applied to women who are deformed and are
    not desirable.” (Al-Mughni, 7/463; al-Sharh al-Kabeer ‘ala
    Matan al-Muqni’, 7/347-348).
    X – Uncovering the face in front of kaafir women
The scholars have differed concerning how a Muslim woman should appear
    in front of kaafir women.
Ibn Qudaamah said: “The ruling concerning women dealing with women
    is the same as that concerning men dealing with men. There is no difference between
    Muslims, and no difference between a Muslim woman and a dhimmi (non-Muslim living under
    Muslim rule) woman, just as there is no difference between two Muslim men or between a
    Muslim man and a dhimmi man when it comes to seeing. Ahmad said: ‘Some people think
    that she should not take off her head covering in front of a Jewish or Christian woman.
    However, I think that she (a Jewish or Christian woman) should not see the private part
    (of a Muslim woman), or attend her when she gives birth (i.e., she should not be her
    midwife, because she will look at the most private part of her body when she gives birth
    – except in cases of necessity, as discussed above).’”
Another opinion was reported from Ahmad, according to which a Muslim
    woman should not remove her niqaab in front of a dhimmi woman, because Allaah says
    (interpretation of the meaning): “… or their women …” [al-Noor
    24:31]. But the first opinion is more correct, because kaafir women, Jewish and
    others, used to enter upon the wives of the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be
    upon him), and they did not wear hijaab in front of them nor were they commanded to do so.
    ‘Aa’ishah said that a Jewish woman used to come and talk to her, saying
    “May Allaah save you from the punishment of the grave,” and she
    [‘Aa’ishah] asked the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be
    upon him)… Asma’ said, “My mother came to me, and she had no desire to
    become Muslim. I asked the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
    him), ‘Should I uphold the ties of kinship with her?’ and he said,
    ‘Yes.’”
Moreover, hijaab between men and women serves a purpose that is not an
    issue in the case of a Muslim woman and a dhimmi woman, just as it is not an issue in the
    case of a Muslim man and a dhimmi man. Hijaab is obligatory when there is a text stating
    that it is so or the obligation may be understood by analogy; in the case of a Muslim
    woman and a non-Muslim woman, there is neither text nor analogy.
The aayah “… or their women …” [al-Noor 24:31]
    could refer to all women. (Al-Mughni, 7/464; al-Sharh al-Kabeer ‘ala
    Matan al-Muqni’, 7/351 bi haamish al-Mughni).
    Ibn al-‘Arabi al-Maaliki said: “The correct
    view, in my opinion, is that this permissible in the case of all women, and that it
    appears with the pronoun ( -hinna = their) to match the rest of the aayah. This is
    the aayah of pronouns, where the pronoun -hinna appears twenty-five times; there is
    nothing else like it in the Qur’aan. So this word matches the others.” (Ahkaam
    al-Qur’aan, 3/326).
    Al-Aloosi said: “Al-Fakhr al-Raazi suggested that
    the dhimmi woman is like the Muslim woman, and he said: “The correct opinion is that
    she (the dhimmi woman) is like the Muslim woman, and ‘their women’ means
    all women. The opinion of the salaf (early generations of Islam) should be understood on
    the basis that (covering in front of non-Muslim women) is preferable, but it is not
    obligatory.” Then he said: “This view is easier for people today, for Muslim
    woman can hardly observe hijaab in front of dhimmi women.” (Tafseer
    al-Aloosi, 19/143).
    Muhammad Fu’aad said: “If this opinion was
    easier in their time, then no doubt it is more appropriate and easier in our own time,
    especially for those women who, because of circumstances beyond their control, find that
    they have to live in non-Muslim countries, where they mix with non-Muslim women and their
    lives are interwoven with theirs, to the extent that observing hijaab in front of them is
    fraught with difficulties. Truly, to Allaah we belong, and truly, to Him we shall
    return.”
XI – Hajj and ‘Umrah
Women must uncover their faces and hands when they enter ihraam for
    Hajj or ‘Umrah. At this time, they are forbidden to wear niqaab and gloves, because
    the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The woman
    who is in ihraam must not wear niqaab or gloves.”
If a woman needs to cover her face because men are passing close by
    her, or she is beautiful and is sure that men are looking at her, she should drop a part
    of head covering over her face, because of the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah in which she
    said, “Riders were passing by us, and we were in ihraam with the Messenger of Allaah 
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), so when they came near, each of us would
    lower her jilbaab over her face, and when they went away we would uncover our faces
    again.”
Al-Juzayri said, reporting from them: “A woman may cover her face
    for a necessary reason, such as non-mahram men passing close by her, and the fact that
    (the cloth) will touch her face does not matter. This is to make it easy and alleviate
    hardship.” (Al-Fiqh ‘ala’l-Madhaahib al-Arba’ah, 1/645).
    These are situations in which it is acceptable for a
    woman to uncover her face and hands, explained in detail by the fuqaha’ and scholars.
    But there is one other situation which deserves our attention, and that is when a Muslim
    woman is forced to uncover her face – what is the ruling in this case?
XII – Compulsion
Some oppressive regimes have instituted harsh laws which go against the
    religion of Islam and rebel against Allaah and His Messenger. These laws prevent Muslim
    women from wearing proper hijaab, and some of them even remove their niqaab by force and
    subject them to the worst type of oppression and persecution.
Women who wear niqaab have been subjected to harassment in certain
    European countries, where they have been subjected to harm, and Islam and the Prophet 
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) have been slandered. 
Therefore, when a woman is certain that she is likely to be subjected
    to unbearable harassment, she is permitted to uncover her face. It is better to follow a
    scholarly opinion which is less correct than to expose herself to trouble at the hands of
    evil men.
If a woman is permitted to uncover her face and hands in the situations
    described above, which do not involve force or harassment, then surely it is more likely
    that she is permitted to uncover them when she is faced with a threat to herself and her
    religion, especially when her niqaab may expose her to tormentors who may pull the hijaab
    from her head or subject her to worse abuse. In cases of necessity, things that are
    ordinarily forbidden are permitted, within the limits of what is strictly necessary, as
    the scholars have stated, but this should not lead one to take the matter of covering the
    face lightly. Each woman must evaluate the situation in which she is living and learn from
    her own experience and that of others, so that she will be sure of what is a case of real
    necessity, as opposed to her own whims and weaknesses.
Although women are permitted to uncover their faces and hands in the
    exceptional situations described above, they are not permitted to wear make-up and visible
    jewellery if they do so. It is forbidden for them to display these things in front of
    non-mahram men, according to all the fuqaha’, because Allaah says (interpretation of
    the meaning): “… and not to show off their adornment…” [al-Noor
    24:31], and because there is no need to do so. (Hijaab al-Muslimah bayna
    Intihaal wa Ta’weel al-Jaahileen, p. 239).
