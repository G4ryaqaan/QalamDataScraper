44819,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/44819,"He had a relationship with a girl for two years, can he propose marriage to her?","I am a young man who had a lot of problems in my life and I could not find anyone to show me sympathy, especially in the absence of anyone who is sincere in friendship. So I turned to a girl who overwhelmed me with her kindness and sincerity which I will never forget as long as I live. But now after going out with her for two years during which I have not done anything wrong like zina, may Allaah keep us safe from that and from our bad deeds, I want to propose marriage to her. Is this relationship permitted or not?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The relationship mentioned in the question is a forbidden relationship and an obvious sin. It is not permissible for a man to form a relationship with a non-mahram woman where they become friends and go out together, because that involves doing things which Allaah has forbidden, namely looking, touching, being alone together and talking softly. Such relationships are not free of these things. It is one of the tricks of the Shaytaan to make such relationships attractive to people, so that a person feels his worries have been relieved or reduced because of this relationship. This is obvious from your words “I turned to” … “her sincerity” “I will never forget” etc. … In addition to your denial of having done anything wrong despite the fact that what has happened is a kind of forbidden relationship, even if we assume that it has not reached the level of zina. 
What you have to do is to repent to Allaah and to be convinced that what you have done is wrong. You have to give up this evil action and regret what has happened in the past. Remember the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to the one who came to him and asked him for permission to commit zina: “Would you like it for your mother?” He said: “No, by Allaah, may Allaah cause me to be sacrificed for you.” He said: “And people do not like it for their mothers.” He said: “Would you like it for your daughter?” He said: “No, by Allaah, O Messenger of Allaah, may Allaah cause me to be sacrificed for you.” He said: “And people do not like it for their daughters.” He said: “Would you like it for your sister?” He said: “No, by Allaah, may Allaah cause me to be sacrificed for you.” He said: “And people do not like it for their sisters.” He said, “Would you like it for your paternal aunt?” He said: “No, by Allaah, may Allaah cause me to be sacrificed for you.” He said: “And people do not like it for their paternal aunts.” He said, “Would you like it for your maternal aunt?” He said: “No, by Allaah, may Allaah cause me to be sacrificed for you.” He said: “And people do not like it for their maternal aunts.” 
Narrated by Ahmad, 22265; classed as saheeh by Shaykh Shu’ayb al-Arnaa’oot in Tahqeeq al-Musnad. 
With regard to proposing marriage to her, there is no reason why you should not, after establishing that she is righteous and that she regularly fulfils the duties required in Islam, and that she keeps away from haraam things, and that she has repented from this sinful relationship.

44825,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/44825,"He is asking about the hadeeth, “The most beloved names to Allah…”","How sound is the hadeeth, “The most beloved names to Allah are ‘Abd-Allah and ‘Abd al-Rahmaan”? What is the text of this hadeeth?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The hadeeth referred to in the question is saheeh. It was narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh (2132) from the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The most beloved of your names to Allah are ‘Abd-Allah and ‘Abd al-Rahmaan.” 
Abu Dawood (4950) narrated that Abu Wahb al-Jushami, who was a companion of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Give your children the names of Prophets, and the most beloved of names to Allah are ‘Abd-Allah and ‘Abd al-Rahmaan, and the most truthful are Haarith and Hammaam [these names both refer to one who is always doing something, whether good or bad], and the worst are Harb and Murrah [meaning ‘war’ and ‘bitterness’ respectively].” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
The names which reflect servitude to Allah (those that start with “ ‘Abd” meaning “slave of”) are more beloved to Allah than others, because they affirm the attributes that befit Him and do not befit anyone else. No one among mankind has any right to them or any share in them. This has to do with His divine Attributes (sifaat al-uloohiyyah). They also affirm the status that befits the person, which never alters for an instant throughout his lifetime, namely the status of servitude, of being the slave of his Lord. So the name reflects well on the one who carries it; it honours the person who is given this name by describing him as a slave of his Lord. Hence these names carry great virtue. 
The connection between the slave and Allah is one of pure servitude (‘uboodiyyah), and the connection between Allah and the slave is one of complete mercy. It is by His mercy that he exists in the true sense of the word, and the purpose for which he was created is to worship Allah alone, with love, fear, hope, worship and veneration, so he is a slave to Allah. 
This is what is meant by the name: that the owner of this name is connected to one of the attributes of Allah which cannot be attributed to anyone else. 
Because His mercy prevails over His wrath, mercy is more beloved to Him than anger, so the name ‘Abd al-Rahmaan (“slave of the Most Merciful”) is dearer to him than the name ‘Abd al-Qaahir (“slave of the Subduer”) and similar names. 
So these names refer to these two meanings, that of divinity and that of servitude, and that means that the name is a constant reminder of the slave’s humble position before his Lord, and a constant prayer for the Lord’s mercy towards His poor, humble servant. 
Some scholars have stated that these two names have their own special features, which is that in the Qur’aan, Allah does not mention the word ‘abd (or its plural ‘ibaad) in conjunction with any of the names of Allah except these two. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And when the slave of Allah [‘abd Allah] (Muhammad) stood up invoking Him”
[al-Jinn 72:19] 
“And the (faithful) slaves of the Most Gracious [‘ibaad al-Rahmaan] (Allah)”
[al-Furqaan 25:63]
This is supported by the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say (O Muhammad): Invoke Allah or invoke the Most Gracious [al-Rahmaan] (Allah)”
[al-Isra’ 17:110]
If the first thing of which a child becomes aware and understands and hears is this name, the idea will take root in his heart that he is a slave of Allah and that Allah is his Lord, and that his Lord is the Most Gracious, Most Merciful, and it will be easy to raise him accordingly. 
For more information please see Tuhfat al-Mawdood bi Ahkaam al-Mawlood, by Ibn al-Qayyim; Fath al-Baari by Ibn Hajar, in his commentary on the chapter Ahabb al-Asma’ ila Allah (the most beloved names to Allah); and al-Sindi’s commentary on Ibn Maajah (Haashiyat al-Sindi ‘ala Ibn Maajah).

44833,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/44833,He committed the secret habit during the nights of Mina when on Hajj,"A man who is weak in his religious commitment performed Hajj, but he committed the secret habit (masturbation) once during on the nights when the pilgrims stay overnight in Mina. Does he have to do anything?",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is astonishing to hear of pilgrims who have left their homes and families and come, body and soul, to perform the rituals which Allaah has made one of the pillars of Islam, then one of them disobeys his Lord, and where? In the holy places, in the sanctuary! In Mina, which is within the boundaries of the Haram. We have already stated in the answer to question no. 329 that the secret habit is haraam, and undoubtedly a sin becomes more serious if it is committed at a time or in a place that is regarded as holy, which is what has happened in this case, where it was done in the sanctuary during a time that is venerated, namely the Ayaam al-tashreeq, the days of the rituals and of remembering Allaah. 
Committing sin during Hajj diminishes its reward. The scholars said concerning the accepted Hajj: it is that in which there is no sin. This is indicated by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Whoever performs Hajj and does not utter obscene speech or commit immoral actions will go back (free of sin) as on the day his mother bore him.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1521; Muslim, 1350. 
The person asked about here has to repent to Allaah and seek forgiveness. He has to sincerely regret what he did, and resolve not to go back to that sin. He also has to do a lot of acts of worship and pray to Allaah to accept them from him. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
Sin in general detracts from the reward of Hajj, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So whosoever intends to perform Hajj therein (by assuming Ihraam), then he should not have sexual relations (with his wife), nor commit sin, nor dispute unjustly during the Hajj”
[al-Baqarah 2:197]
Some of the scholars said: Sin during Hajj invalidates the Hajj, because it is forbidden during Hajj. But the majority of the scholars follow their well-known principle that if a prohibition is not connected to a specific act of worship then it does not invalidate it. Sins are not connected specifically to ihraam, rather sins are forbidden whether one is in ihraam or not. This is the correct view. These sins do not invalidate the Hajj but they do detract from it. 
Fataawa Arkaan al-Islam, p. 571 
Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about a man who committed the secret habit after entering ihraam for Hajj and before going to ‘Arafat. He replied: 
Your Hajj is valid according to the more correct of the two scholarly views, but you have to repent to Allaah from that, because the secret habit is haraam for both pilgrims and others, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And those who guard their chastity (i.e. private parts, from illegal sexual acts)
6. Except from their wives or (the slaves) that their right hands possess, for then, they are free from blame;
7. But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors”
[al-Mu’minoon 23:5-7]
And because it causes a great deal of harm as the scholars have explained. We ask Allaah to guide us and you. You also have to offer a sacrifice in Makkah, the meat of which should be given to the poor.

    You can delay entering ihraam for ‘Umrah until your stay in 
    Jeddah is over, then go back to the meeqaat and enter ihraam from there. It 
    is not permissible for you to enter ihraam from Jeddah. 

    The Standing Committee was asked about a student who is

    away. On Thursdays and Fridays he goes to al-Qanfadhah then he comes back to 
    Jeddah. If he wants to do ‘Umrah, from where should he enter ihraam? 

    They replied: 
If you set out for ‘Umrah 
    from Jeddah then you should enter ihraam from Jeddah, and if you form the 
    intention whilst you are in al-Qanfadhah then you should enter ihraam from 
    the meeqaat of the people of Yemen. 

    Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah li’l-Buhooth al-‘Ilmiyyah 
    wa’l-Ifta’, 11/136 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was asked about a man who traveled from 
    his country to Jeddah, then he wanted to do ‘Umrah. Should he enter ihraam 
    from Jeddah? 

    The answer: 

    One of two scenarios must apply in this case: 

    1 – This person traveled to Jeddah without any intention of 
    performing ‘Umrah, then the idea of ‘Umrah occurred to him whilst he was in 
    Jeddah. So he should enter ihraam from Jeddah and there is nothing wrong 
    with that, because of the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with 
    him) which mentions the meeqaats. He said: “… and whoever is within these 
    boundaries can enter Ihram from the place he sets out from, and the people 
    of Makkah can start from Makkah.”

    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1524; Muslim, 1181. 
2 – If he came from his 
    country with the intention of performing ‘Umrah and firmly resolved to do 
    so. In this case he has to enter ihraam from the meeqaat that he passes 
    through, and it is not permissible for him to enter ihraam from Jeddah, 
    because that is closer to Makkah than the meeqaat, and it was proven that 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, when he 
    defined the meeqaats:  “And these meeqaats are for the people at those very 
    places, and besides them for those who come through those places with the 
    intention of performing Hajj and 'Umrah.” 

    If he enters ihraam from Jeddah and goes to Makkah in that 
    state, then according to the scholars he has to offer a compensatory 
    sacrifice, which should be slaughtered in Makkah and its meat given in 
    charity to the poor; and his ‘Umrah is valid. 

    If he did not enter ihraam from Jeddah after arriving there, 
    and he formed the intention to perform ‘Umrah before he reached Jeddah, then 
    he should go back to the meeqaat and enter ihraam from there, and he does 
    not have to do anything (offer a sacrifice). And Allaah knows best. 

    Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 
    21/291. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was 
    also asked about a group of pilgrims who resolved to perform Hajj. They are 
    people from Riyadh who had been sent to do some work at the airport at 
    Jeddah. Some of them resolved to perform Hajj ifraad, some to perform 
    tamattu’ and some to perform qiraan, but they passed the meeqaat and did not 
    enter ihraam because there was a long time to go, nearly a month, from the 
    time they started their work until the Hajj season began. Do they all have 
    to offer a sacrifice or only some of them, depending on what their intention 
    was? 

    The reply: 

    With regard to those who intended to perform tamattu’, their 
    failing to enter ihraam from the meeqaat is a mistake which goes against the 
    wisdom of sharee’ah. It would have been better for them to enter ihraam from 
    the meeqaat and perform ‘Umrah, then exit ihraam and go to Jeddah. As for 
    those who intended to perform qiraan and ifraad, it is true that it would be 
    difficult for them to spend a whole month in ihraam; when the time for Hajj 
    came they should have gone out to the meeqaat that they had passed and 
    entered ihraam from there. If that was difficult for them and they could not 
    go to the meeqaat, then they could enter ihraam from Jeddah, but according 
    to the scholars they have to offer a sacrifice in Makkah and distribute the 
    meat to the poor. The same applies to those doing tamattu’ so long as they 
    have not yet entered ihraam. If they want to enter ihraam for ‘Umrah then 
    they have to go out to al-Sayl (the meeqaat for the people of Riyaadh) and 
    enter ihraam from there, then perform tawaaf and saa’i, cut their hair and 
    exit ihraam.

      concerning vows is that if what is vowed is something that is permitted in

      be given in any way in which charity is given, such as to the poor and 
      needy. 

    With regard to eating from it, if the custom in the country 
    where he lives is for the one who makes a vow of giving something edible to 
    eat from it, it is permissible for him to do so, based on the local 
    traditions and customs. Similarly, if he intended when he made the vow to 
    eat from it, then both custom and intention apply to the part that he eats, 
    and that is not part of that concerning which the vow was made. A fatwa was 
    issued by the Standing Committee concerning that, which states the 
    following: 
The way in which a vow is 
    to be fulfilled is to give in the manner intended by the one who made the 
    vow, within the limits of sharee’ah. So if he intended the meat mentioned in 
    his vow to be given to the poor, it is not permissible for him to eat from 
    it, but if he intended in his vow to give it to his family or to a group of 
    whom he is a member, then it is permissible for him to eat as one of them, 
    because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “Actions are but by intentions and each person will have but that which he 
    intended.” The same applies if he stipulates that in his vow or if that is 
    the custom in his country. 

    From Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah li’l-Ifta, 23/390 

    And it says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (23/392): 
    Whoever makes a vow to offer food, the basic principle is that the one who

    eat from it, in which case it is permitted for him to eat as he stipulated

Please respond.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The scholars differed concerning acting upon weak ahadith which encourage righteous deeds. Some of them were of the view that it is permissible to act upon them, subject to certain conditions, and others were of the view that it is not permissible to act upon them. 
Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) summed up the conditions for it to be permissible to act upon a weak hadith, which are as follows: 
1 – It should not be very weak, and one should not act upon a hadith which was narrated only by one of the liars or those who are accused of lying, or whose mistakes are serious. 
2 – It should mention a good deed for which there is a basis in sharee’ah. 
3 – When acting upon it one should not believe that the action is well-founded, rather he should do it on the basis of erring on the side of caution. 
Acting upon a weak hadith does not mean that we believe it is mustahabb to do an act of worship simply because a da’eef hadith has been narrated concerning it. None of the scholars has said such a thing – as we shall see from the words of Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, below – rather what it means is that if it is proven that a certain act of worship is mustahabb because there is sound (saheeh) shar’i evidence – as in the case of qiyaam al-layl (supererogatory prayers at night), for example – then we find a da’eef hadith which speaks of the virtue of qiyaam al-layl, then there is nothing wrong with acting upon this weak hadith in that case. What is meant by acting upon it is narrating it in order to encourage people to do this act of worship, in the hope that the one who does it will earn the reward mentioned in the da’eef hadith, because acting on the weak hadith in this case will not lead to doing something that is forbidden in sharee’ah, such as saying that an act of worship is mustahabb that is not proven in sharee’ah. Rather, if he earns this reward all well and good, otherwise no harm is done.  
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Majmoo’ al-Fatawa, 1/250: 
It is not permissible in Islam to rely on weak ahadith that are neither saheeh nor hasan, but Ahmad ibn Hanbal and other scholars regarded it is permissible to narrate reports concerning righteous deeds which are not known to be proven, so long as they are not known to be lies, on the basis that if an action is known to be prescribed in Islam from shar’i evidence, and there is a hadith which is not known to be a lie, it is possible that the reward referred to in that weak hadith may be true. None of the imams said that it is permissible to regard something as obligatory or mustahabb on the basis of a weak hadith; whoever says that is going against scholarly consensus. It is permissible to narrate reports that are not known to be lies in order to encourage and warn people, but only with regard to matters where it is known that Allah has encouraged or warned against them on the basis of other evidence the status of whose narrators is not unknown. End quote. 
Abu Bakr ibn al-‘Arabi said that it is not permissible to act on the basis of a weak hadith at all, whether with regard to virtuous deeds or otherwise… See Tadreeb al-Raawi, 1/252. 
This is the view favoured by al-Albaani (may Allah have mercy on him). See the introduction to Saheeh al-Targheeb wa’l-Tarheeb, 1/47-67. 
The saheeh proven reports from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) offer us sufficient evidence that we have no need to act on the basis of weak hadiths. 
The Muslim must strive to find out which ahadith are sound (saheeh) and which are weak (da’eef), and be content to act on the basis of the sound reports.

Please advise us, may Allaah have mercy on you, because the people who say this are calling upon the people to leave their homes and flee to other places if they want to survive.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh 
    Haamid al-‘Ali was asked on his website about this question and he said: The 
    Muslim should be sure of three things when he hears this kind of news: 
1 – That 
    life on earth will never come to an end except as described in the Book of 
    Allaah and the Sunnah of His Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him). The end of history will never occur before the emergence of all 
    of the lesser and greater signs of the Hour. One of those signs is that 
    there will be conflict between the people of truth, who are the Muslims, and 
    the people of evil and falsehood, who are all of those who oppose the 
    religion of truth, Islam, and strive to extinguish its light. There are two 
    distinct features of this conflict which will occur before the end of life. 
    The first is a conflict between the Muslims and the people of the cross, as 
    is mentioned in the saheeh ahaadeeth which speak of the battles at the end 
    of time. 
The second 
    is the battle between the Muslims at the time of the descent of ‘Eesa (peace 
    be upon him) with the Dajjaal and his followers among the Jews. Then Ya’jooj 
    and Ma’jooj (Gog and Magog) will appear, and they will die as one. 
Then the 
    Muslims will rule the earth, then everyone in whose heart is faith equal to 
    a grain of corn will die, when a cold wind blows that will take the souls of 
    the believers. Then the Hour will begin soon after that and it will come 
    upon the most evil of people who are scattered throughout the earth. The 
    universe will not be destroyed when there is still one believer on earth, 
    but when faith is gone it will be destroyed, because belief in Allaah is a 
    reason for life to continue. 
The point is 
    that it is not permissible for a Muslim to believe that the end of the world 
    will occur in a manner different to that which is mentioned in the proven 
    texts of the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
2 – It is 
    not permissible for a Muslim to believe that heavenly bodies can bring 
    benefit or ward off harm, or that they can bring provision or bring joy or 
    sorrow, or that they have any control on the lives of men, and so on. This 
    is a polytheistic belief (shirk) which is held by people of Jaahiliyyah. It 
    is stated in the saheeh ahaadeeth that whoever believes in this is guilty of 
    kufr. Thus it is clear that all claims made by astrologers are lies, kufr 
    and shirk (the association of others with Allaah, may He be exalted). 
The planets 
    are no more than bodies that are subject to the decree of Allaah and play 
    their role in the universe. This does not mean that they do not behave 
    according to the natural laws according to which Allaah has established the 
    universe or have an effect on one another, as a result of which calamities, 
    disasters and earthquakes occur. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah mentioned that 
    eclipses affect the earth. The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) said: “A sign by means of which Allaah instils fear in His 
    slaves” i.e., it points to the approach of events that have been decreed by 
    Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, in order to instil fear and remind 
    people of Allaah, an eloquent reminder of His power, a reminder of the end 
    of the world, a reminder to him not to transgress and to remember always 
    that he is on the earth of Allaah which, if He willed, He could cause to 
    shake beneath his feet, and he would not be able to do anything. 
Hence 
    earthquakes usually happen after eclipses, as do destructive storms. We seek 
    refuge with Allaah from His wrath. He mentioned that the Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sought refuge with Allaah from the 
    moon, because it has an effect, otherwise why would he seek refuge from it? 
    But its effect is physical in nature like other physical effects that Allaah 
    has created. 
So long as 
    the Muslim believes that this all happens by the will and decree of Allaah, 
    and that they are signs by means of which Allaah instils fear in His slaves, 
    then it does not matter. But it is essential to understand the relationship 
    between the movement of the planets and the sun and the movements of the 
    earth, and the layers of the earth and the movement of the winds, on a 
    scientific basis, and the interaction of natural scientific laws. Islam does 
    not forbid that, rather it enjoins us to discover the laws of the universe 
    that Allaah has created. 
3 – It is 
    not permissible for a Muslim to ignore the ahaadeeth in which the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) spoke of what is to happen 
    in the future in favour of what is said by scientists and astronomers whose 
    words may be based on conjectures or expectations which soon be shown to be 
    wrong. It is not valid for anyone to say that the fall of America, the 
    emergence of the Mahdi, or the change in the global system or the balance of 
    power will come as the result of the movement of the planets which will have 
    a disastrous effect on the earth, in such and such a year, etc. 
Whoever 
    states such a thing is speculating and speaking without knowledge, speaking 
    about the unseen with no knowledge. If he is speaking within the framework 
    of possibility, and what could happen, well many things could happen, but no 
    one knows what is going to happen, and when, except Allaah alone. 
We have been 
    commanded to strive against our enemies with what we have been given of 
    strength, and to strive to surpass them, or to be equal to them, or to come 
    close to them in terms of the physical and moral resources that they have, 
    and not to rely on natural calamities  to destroy our enemies. 
We know from 
    the seerah of our Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    that we should face our enemies with reliance upon Allaah first and 
    foremost, then by means of the deep faith in our beliefs that Allaah has 
    given us, and with firm resolve to reclaim our rights, patience in adhering 
    to our path and persistence in conveying the message and ongoing jihad, 
    until we reach our goal and our highest aim, which is to lead mankind to 
    guidance and light, so that all of mankind may enjoy the message of mercy 
    with which our Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was 
    sent. This is what he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did 
    during his lifetime, and we have the best of examples in him. 
After this, 
    we say that what this speaker has said about the planet Nibiru is worthless 
    until it is proven by sound scientific evidence. If this planet is to have a 
    destructive effect by passing close to the earth, and that is proven, then 
    what we have to do is adhere to the three guidelines mentioned above, and 
    turn to Allaah, praying to Him to avert disaster, and if it happens to 
    relieve us of it, and to make the consequences better for us and the 
    Muslims. 
But we think 
    that everything that is said about this planet is a fabrication that has no 
    basis in truth, or it is an exaggeration, and it is unwise to pay any 
    attention to it.  
And Allaah 
    knows best. 
What the 
    questioner mentioned in his question has occurred in the past, and nothing 
    happened, which confirms the idea that this is speculation and speaking 
    without knowledge.",Islam Q&A
