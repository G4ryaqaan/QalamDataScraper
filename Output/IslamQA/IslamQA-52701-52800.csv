52703,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/52703,Is there an age at which a woman no longer needs a mahram?,"I am a single woman aged 38. I am a teacher and I have not got married yet. My father has passed away, and I help my mother to some extent with household expenses. I want to perform Hajj, and my name was drawn in the “lottery” (to select who can go for Hajj) but I need a mahram. My brother does not have enough money to spend on his own expenses. I know that I should pay for him, but I need the money for my future needs. So I have decided to delay this obligatory duty until I reach an age when I no longer need a mahram. Will I punished for my decision? I hope you can answer me because I am very anxious.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
      Firstly: 

    Hajj is only obligatory for those who are able to do it, 
    because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And Hajj (pilgrimage to 
    Makkah) to the House (Ka‘bah) is a duty that mankind owes to Allaah, those 
    who can afford the expenses”

    [Aal ‘Imraan 3:97]

    One of the conditions of being able to do it for a woman is 
    that she should have a mahram who agrees to go with her. If she cannot find 
    a mahram then she is not obliged to perform Hajj. 

    It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (11/93): One 
    of the conditions of Hajj being obligatory is that one should be able to do 
    it, which includes having a mahram for women. If a woman does not have a 
    mahram then she is not permitted to travel, and she is not obliged to 
    perform Hajj unless she has a mahram and he agrees to travel with her. 
    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And Hajj (pilgrimage to 
    Makkah) to the House (Ka‘bah) is a duty that mankind owes to Allaah, those 
    who can afford the expenses”

    [Aal ‘Imraan 3:97]

    See also questions no. 316,
    5207 and
    34380. 

    Secondly: 

    There is no age at which a woman does not need a mahram, 
    rather at all ages of her life after she reaches puberty it is not 
    permissible for her to travel without a mahram. No distinction is made 
    between young women and old women, because the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No woman should travel except with a 
    mahram.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim. 

    We have explained this in the answers to questions no.
    47029 and
    25841. 

    Thirdly: 

    If a woman has a mahram, she has to spend on him.  

    Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    She has to spend on her mahram’s expenses during Hajj, as was 
    stated by Ahmad, because this is part of her being able to perform Hajj. So 
    she has to spend on his expenses such as travel. Based on this, part of her 
    ability to perform Hajj is that she should be able to afford provisions and 
    travel expenses for herself and for her mahram. 

    Al-Mughni, 3/99 

    Al-Sarkhasi said: 
If a mahram travels with 
    her then she should spend on him from her own wealth. 

    Al-Mabsoot, 4/163 

    Fourthly: 

    With regard to your delaying Hajj because you need the money, 
    please see question no. (11534).

52724,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/52724,"Their father left instructions that a waqf be set up, but they have not carried it out","My father died and left property to his heirs, except for one house which he said was to made a waqf for the sake of Allah, and its income was to be spent on the poor and needy (as an ongoing charity). But the heirs did not follow the instructions left in his will and they sold their shares to the youngest brother. I am the oldest brother and I did not sell my share out of fear of Allah. But my young brother is putting a lot pf pressure on me and he wants me to sell my share as well. Is it permissible for me to get rid of this problem by selling my share and donating the money to a charitable cause or building a mosque (as an ongoing charity) for my father?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Making a will is prescribed according to the Quran and Sunnah, and scholarly consensus. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“It is prescribed for you, when death approaches any of you, if he leaves wealth, that he makes a bequest to parents and next of kin, according to reasonable manners. (This is) a duty upon Al-Muttaqoon (the pious)”
[al-Baqarah 2:180]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah has given you authority over the disposal of one-third of your wealth, at the time of your death, so that you may able to add to the record of your good deeds.” Narrated by Ibn Maajah 2709; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah. 
A waqf (Islamic endowment) is a kind of ongoing charity from which the donor may benefit after his death, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stated when he said: “When a man dies, all his good deeds come to an end except three: ongoing charity, beneficial knowledge, and a righteous son who will pray for him.” Narrated by Muslim, 1631. 
It is not permissible to bequeath more than one-third of one's wealth, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to Sa’d ibn Abi Waqqaas (may Allah be pleased with him) when he wanted to bequeath all of his wealth: “One-third, and one-third is a lot.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2742; Muslim, 1628. 
If this house is equivalent to one-third of the estate or less, then all of it is a waqf. If it is more than one-third, then the part of it that is a waqf is whatever is equivalent to one-third of the estate. 
Secondly: 
It is not permissible to sell a waqf, or to take possession of it or seize it. It is not permissible for the heirs to include it with the rest of the estate and share it out. 
According to the hadeeth of ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allah be pleased with him), when he wanted to give some land in Khaybar as a waqf, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him: “It is not to be sold, given as a gift or inherited…” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2764; Muslim, 1633. 
Based on this, it is not permissible for you to agree to your brother’s demand to sell to him; rather this house is not your property that you can sell. Now you are standing in their way, so do not give in to them. Carry on refusing, and may Allah guide them. 
Your brother’s selling it before is an invalid transaction. 
You have to advise them to fear Allah and advise your youngest brother to give the money back, and make it a waqf as instructed by your father. 
Scare them with the punishment of Allah and the punishment for consuming forbidden wealth, for every body that is nourished from haraam earnings, the Fire is more fitting for it.   
We ask Allah to guide you and help you to do that which is best for you in this world and in the Hereafter.

52768,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/52768,Is this relationship brotherhood for the sake of Allaah or a relationship that is not acceptable according to sharee’ah?,"I am a religiously committed (praise be to Allaah) young man, studying in University in a Muslim Arab country, in which many young people have gone astray from Islam. It has become difficult to find righteous friends as the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) advised us to do and as is enjoined in the Holy Qur’aan. A while ago I got to know a girl who wears hijab, and she is the reason why I was guided. We only met on the bus or in the university in order to talk about religion and our love of Allaah, and to encourage one another to memorize Qur’aan and pray qiyaam al-layl, and to forbid one another to do things that Allaah has forbidden of indulging in falsehood and other mistakes that a person may make without realizing it. I started to long to meet her, because I found that speaking to her strengthened my faith and she helped me to keep on the straight and narrow. But I am confused about how to categorize this relationship and I am not sure whether to continue it or stop it, because she is not one of my relatives.

 Can I regard her as my sister in Islam?  Is it permissible for me to speak to her on the bus or in the university? Is it permissible for me to look at her face?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
      Many people make the mistake of thinking that the 
      difficulties of our times and the lack of brothers and the corrupt 
      circumstances make it permissible to do things that may lead to their 
      doom, and they fall into the traps of the Shaytaan. 

    Yes, beware of being deceived by the Shaytaan, who makes sin 
    appear to you as obedience, and comes to you through a door which you think 
    you have shut on him, for the Shaytaan keeps knocking at the doors of 
    misguidance and trying to open them to the slaves of Allaah and make them 
    fall into his traps. 

    Have you not heard the words of Allaah (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “(Iblees) said: ‘Because You have sent me astray, surely, 
    I will sit in wait against them (human beings) on Your straight path.

    17. ‘Then I will come to them from before them and behind 
    them, from their right and from their left, and You will not find most of 
    them as thankful ones (i.e. they will not be dutiful to You).’”

    [al-A’raaf 7:16, 17]? 

    Ibn al-Jawzi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in 
    Talbees Iblees (p. 52): 
Iblees tricks people in 
    whatever way he can, and his power over them increases and decreases 
    according to their alertness or negligence, their ignorance or knowledge. 

    Note that the heart is like a fortress, and the devils are 
    always going around the fortress watching for the guards to become heedless. 
    The guard should know all the gates of the fortress which he has been 
    appointed to guard, and he should not let his attention slip for a moment, 
    for the enemy never lets his attention slip. 

    A man said to al-Hasan al-Basri: Does Iblees sleep? 

    He said: If he slept, we would have a break! End quote. 

    The situation which you are asking about is one of the traps 
    of the Shaytaan. How many fires have been lit in the hearts of young men, 
    the first spark of which was a look or a smile or a meeting or a 
    conversation, and how often does that happen under the guise of 
    companionship, mutual advice and calling people to Allaah. 

    When Islam forbade free mixing between men and women, and 
    forbade a man to be alone with a non-mahram woman, or to look at her or 
    shake hands with her, it was paying attention to the evil consequences of 
    such matters. Allaah is the Creator of mankind, and He knows best what is 
    good for them and what is bad for them. 

    The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    said: “No man is alone with a (non-mahram) woman, but the Shaytaan is the 
    third one present.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2165; classed as saheeh by 
    al-Albaani, 1758. 

    What this means is that the Shaytaan is present with them and 
    provokes desire in each of them until he causes them to commit zina. End 
    quote from Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi. 
It was narrated from 
    ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib that a young woman from Khath’am came to the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and asked him a question. 
    Al-Fadl ibn ‘Abbaas was riding behind him on the camel and he turned his 
    face away. Al-‘Abbaas said: “O Messenger of Allaah, why did you turn away 
    your cousin’s face?” He said: I saw a young man and a young woman and I did 
    not feel sure that the Shaytaan would not try to influence them.” 

    Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (885); classed as saheeh by 
    al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. The hadeeth is also narrated in 
    al-Saheehayn. 

    It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (12/163): 
Free mixing of men and 
    women for education is haraam and is a great evil, because it involves 
    fitnah, the spread of immorality and transgression of the sacred limits. The 
    evil and moral corruption that has happened because of this mixing is the 
    strongest evidence for it being haraam. End quote. 

    The Committee was also asked (17/66) the following question: 

    What is the Islamic ruling on friendships with the other sex, 
    knowing that this friendship is decent and chaste and is known to all, with 
    nothing hidden? 

    They replied: 

    This is one of the most serious of haraam actions and the 
    worst of evil deeds. It is not permissible for a woman to make friends with 
    men who are not her mahrams, or vice versa, because that is a means that 
    leads to fitnah and falling into evil deeds. End quote. 

    With regard to looking at her face, we have stated in the 
    answer to question no. 1774 that deliberately looking at a non-mahram woman 
    is haraam. 

    Our advice to you is to make a decision about this 
    relationship. Either take her as your wife, if this girl is 
    religiously-committed and of good character and you have grown fond of her, 
    or cut off this relationship with her and close this door, for it is the 
    door to evil and immorality, so do not leave it open lest you then regret it 
    when regret will be to no avail.

52772,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/52772,Giving the reward for acts of worship to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him),"What is the ruling on one who reads Qur’aan, for example, then says: I give the reward for this reading to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The correct view is that giving the reward for acts of worship to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is an innovation (bid’ah). The evidence for that is as follows: 
1 – There is no need for this giving, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) will have the equivalent of the reward of his ummah, without that detracting from their reward in the slightest. It is proven in al-Saheeh that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever calls to guidance will have a reward like that of those who follow him, without that detracting from their reward in the slightest.” Narrated by Muslim, 2674). And he said: “Whoever sets a good precedent in Islam which is followed after he is gone, will have a reward like those who acted upon it, without it detracting from their reward in the slightest.” Narrated by Muslim, 1017. 
He (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) showed all the ways of guidance to his ummah, so for a person to give the reward for his deed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is redundant, in fact the one who does this is losing out on the reward for himself without it benefiting anyone else. He loses the reward for his deed, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) has an equivalent reward without him having to give it. 
2 – The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not prescribe this for his ummah. Rather he said: “Whoever does an action that is not in accordance with this matter of ours will have it rejected.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2697; Muslim, 1718 – this version narrated by Muslim. 
3 – The salaf – including the Rightly-Guided Caliphs and the rest of the Sahaabah and Taabi’een – did not do that, and they knew best what is good and were more keen to follow it. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “I urge you to adhere to my Sunnah and the way of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs. Adhere to it and cling firmly to it. And beware of newly invented matters, for every newly invented matter is an innovation (bid’ah) and every innovation is a going astray.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 4607; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
See the essay, Ihda’ al-Thawaab li’l-Nabi (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him). 
Ibn al-‘Ata’, the student of al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on them both) was asked: Is it permissible to read Qur’aan and give the reward to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and is there any report concerning that? 
He replied: 
Reading the Holy Qur’aan is one of the best acts of worship, but with regard to giving it to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), no reliable report has been narrated concerning that. Rather that should not be done, because it is an action that is not prescribed. Moreover the reward for reading will reach him anyway, and all the good deeds of his ummah will be weighed in his balance. End quote. 
Al-Sakhaawi narrated from his Shaykh, al-Haafiz ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him), that he was asked about one who read some Qur’aan and said in his du’aa’: O Allaah, add the reward for what I have read to the honour of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). 
He replied: 
This is something that has been invented by later generations. I do not know of any precedent for that. End quote from Mawaahib al-Jaleel, 2/544, 454. 
Moreover there is a difference of scholarly opinion with regard to reading Qur’aan and giving the reward to the dead. See questions no. 70317 and 46698. But even if it is said that that is permissible, it is not permissible to give it to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), because all that is achieved by that is depriving the one who did it of the reward, without it benefiting anyone else.

52773,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/52773,The daughter of a sister through breastfeeding is forbidden in marriage,"My wife’s mother breastfed her son’s son (i.e., the son of my wife’s brother) more than five times, according to what my wife’s mother says (the one who breastfed him and is also his grandmother). Is this child then a brother to my wife through breastfeeding? Is he also a mahram for my daughter as a result and is it permissible for her to uncover in front of him?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Yes, this child has 
      become a brother to your wife through breastfeeding, so he is a maternal 
      uncle through breastfeeding to your children from this wife. So it is 
      permissible for your daughter – from this wife but not from any other wife 
      – to show in front of him what she shows in front of her mahrams. 

    The evidence for that is the fact that the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “What becomes mahram 
    (forbidden for marriage) through breastfeeding is that which becomes mahram 
    through blood ties.”

    Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2645; Muslim, 1447. 
And the daughter of a 
    sister through blood ties is a mahram, because Allaah says (interpretation 
    of the meaning): 
“Forbidden to you (for 
    marriage) are: your mothers, your daughters, your sisters, your father’s 
    sisters, your mother’s sisters, your brother’s daughters, your sister’s 
    daughters”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:23]

    So the daughter of your sister through breastfeeding is also 
    a mahram. 

    It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Maa'idah, 21/116 

    The breastfeeding that makes a child a mahram is five or more 
    breastfeedings within the first two years. If the breastfeeding of the two 
    brothers was like that, then they are brothers through breastfeeding, and 
    the children of each of them are the children of the other through 
    breastfeeding, whether the milk belonged to the father and mother or to the 
    mother only, or to the father only. And it is not permissible for either of 
    them to marry the daughter of the other, because they are the daughters of 
    his brother through breastfeeding.
