43101,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/43101,The difference between ongoing charity (sadaqah jaariyah) and other kinds of charity,"Peace be upon you and the mercy of Allaah and his blessings. May Allaah reward you with good on behalf of Islam and the Muslims. Is there any difference between charity and ongoing charity? If there is a difference, we would like to know some examples of charity and some examples of ongoing charity. If an ongoing charity is destroyed – such as if a man builds a mosque then this mosque is destroyed – will he have the reward of that mosque until the Day of Resurrection? May Allaah reward you with good.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Ongoing charity is the waqf (“Islamic endowment”) which may 
    take many forms. The definition of a waqf is that the origin is “frozen” and 
    the fruits are donated for the sake of Allaah, as was narrated by 
    al-Bukhaari (2737) and Muslim (1633) from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased 
    with him), that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allaah be pleased with him) was 
    given a share of land at Khaybar. He came to the Messenger of Allaah  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and asked him what he should do 
    with it. He said: “O Messenger of Allaah, I have been given a share of land 
    at Khaybar and I have never been given any wealth that is more precious to 
    me than it. What do you command me to do with it?” He said: “If you wish, 
    you can ‘freeze’ it and give it in charity.” So ‘Umar gave it in charity and 
    stipulated that it was not to be sold, given as a gift or inherited, and he 
    gave it in charity to the poor, relatives and slaves, for the sake of Allaah 
    and for wayfarers and guests; there was no sin on the one appointed to look 
    after it if he ate from it on a reasonable basis, and fed others without 
    storing anything for the future.” 
Ibn Maajah (242) narrated 
    that Abu Hurayrah said: “The good deeds that will reach a believer after his 
    death are: knowledge which he learned and then spread; a righteous son whom 
    he leaves behind; a copy of the Qur’aan that he leaves as a legacy; a mosque 
    that he built; a house that he built for wayfarers; a canal that he dug; or 
    charity that he gave during his lifetime when he was in good health. These 
    deeds will reach him after his death.” This hadeeth hwas classed as hasan by 
    al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah. 
Ongoing charity may mean 
    building a mosque, buying Mushafs (copies of the Qur’aan) to be placed in 
    the mosque, or designating a house or a place as a waqf so that its income 
    is spent on the poor, orphans, relatives, seekers of knowledge or others as 
    stipulated by the one who establishes the waqf, or donating money to build a 
    charitable hospital, and so on. 
With regard to 
    charity that is not ongoing, this is charity in which the thing given is not 
    “frozen”, rather it is given to the poor to become his property and be made 
    use of however he wishes, such as giving him money, food, clothing, medicine 
    or furniture. 
If a person establishes a 
    mosque as a waqf, then it is destroyed or falls down, it is permissible to 
    sell part of it in order to renovate the rest. If it is not possible to make 
    use of any part of it, then the whole thing may be sold and the money 
    donated to another waqf. Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
    “If a waqf is destroyed and nothing is left of it, it may be sold and the 
    money used to buy something to be given back to the people in charge of the 
    waqf, and it should be made a waqf like the first one was. The same applies 
    to a horse kept for jihad, if it is no longer fit for fighting, it should be 
    sold and the money used to buy another one that is fit for jihad. What we 
    conclude from this is that if a waqf is destroyed and is no longer of any 
    use, such as a house that collapses or land that is ruined and becomes dead 
    and no longer fit for cultivation, or a mosque from which the people move 
    away, and is now in a place where people do not pray, or it becomes too 
    small for the people and cannot accommodate them all, or it falls into 
    disrepair, and it cannot be maintained except by selling part of it, then it 
    is permissible to sell part of it in order to take care of the maintenance 
    of the rest of it. If it is not possible to use any part of it, then the 
    whole thing may be sold. Ahmad said, according to a report narrated by Abu 
    Dawood: if there are two pieces of wood in the mosque which are of some 
    value, it is permissible to sell them and spend the money raised on the 
    mosque. According to a report narrated by Saalih: the mosque may be removed 
    to another location if there is the fear of it being robbed or if the 
    location is in a filthy area. Al-Qaadi said: i.e., if that prevents people 
    from praying there. And he stated that it is permissible to sell its 
    courtyard, according to a report narrated by ‘Abd-Allaah. The imam should 
    give testimony to that effect (i.e., that these changes are necessary)
    
From al-Mughni, 
    5/368.
 So long as the waqf is 
    still in existence, the reward for its founder will be ongoing; the same is 
    also true if the original waqf is sold and the money put into a new waqf. 
    Whoever builds a mosque will have the reward promised for that. This is what 
    is narrated in the words of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him): “Whoever builds a mosque for the sake of Allaah, even if it is 
    like the nest of a sand grouse, Allaah will build for him a house in 
    Paradise.” The hadeeth gives an example of building the smallest thing 
    possible. Narrated by Ahmad, 2157; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in

    greeting the hand of a woman who is not his mahram, even if she covers her hand with her garment, because of the hadeeth narrated by al-Bukhaari 
    in his Saheeh from ‘Urwah, from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her), in which she told the story of how the women gave their bay’ah 
    (oath of allegiance) to the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). She said: “No, by Allaah, his hand never touched 
    the hand of any woman when accepting the oath of allegiance, all he said was, ‘I accept your oath of allegiance on this basis.’” 
And Ahmad narrated with a saheeh isnaad from 
    Umaymah bint Raqeeqah that she said: “I came to the Messenger of Allaah (S) with other women to give the oath of allegiance to him, and he 
    accepted our pledge to abide by what is in the Qur’aan… We said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah, will you not shake hands with us?’ He said, ‘I do not 
    shake hands with women. Rather what I say to a hundred woman is what I would say to one woman.’”  
And we have in the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) the best example. The One Who sent him said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Indeed in the Messenger of Allaah 
    (Muhammad) you have a good example to follow for him who hopes for (the Meeting with) Allaah and the Last Day, and remembers Allaah much”

Indeed, he is her paradise and her hell. For example, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allaah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means”
[al-Nisa’ 4:34]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible for a woman to fast when her husband is present except with his permission, or to allow anyone in his house without his permission.”
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4899. 
Al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, commenting on this hadeeth: Since it is obligatory for a woman to obey her husband with regard to his satisfying his desire, it is more appropriate that it be obligatory for her to obey him in that which is more important than that, namely raising their children, guiding the family, and other rights and duties.
From Adaab al-Zafaaf, p. 282 
Ibn Hibbaan narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If a woman prays her five (daily prayers), fasts her month (Ramadaan), guards her chastity and obeys her husband, it will be said to her: ‘Enter Paradise from whichever of the gates of Paradise you wish.’” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, no. 660. 
Ibn Maajah (1853) narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Abi Awfa said: When Mu’aadh came from Syria, he prostrated to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) who said, “What is this, O Mu'aadh?” He said, I went to Syria and saw them prostrating to their archbishops and patriarchs, and I wanted to do that for you. The Messenger of Allaah (S) said, “Do not do that. If I were to command anyone to prostrate to anyone other than Allaah, I would have commanded women to prostrate to their husbands. By the One in Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, no woman can fulfil her duty towards Allaah until she fulfils her duty towards her husband. If he asks her (for intimacy) even if she is on her camel saddle, she should not refuse.”
Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Ibn Maajah. 
Ahmad (19025) and al-Haakim narrated from al-Husayn ibn Muhsin that his paternal aunt came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) for something and he dealt with her need, then the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Do you have a husband?” She said, “Yes.” He said: “How are you with him?” She said, “I do not neglect any of his rights except those I am unable to fulfil.” He said: “Look at how you are with him, for he is your paradise and your hell” – i.e., he is the cause of you entering Paradise if you fulfil his rights and the cause of your entering Hell if you fall short in that. 
Al-Mundhiri classed the isnaad of this hadeeth as jayyid in al-Targheeb wa’l-Tarheeb; it was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Targheeb wa’l-Tarheeb, no. 1933. 
If there is a conflict between obedience to one’s husband and obedience to one’s parents, then obedience to one’s husband takes priority. Imam Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on him) said concerning a woman who has a husband and a sick mother: Obeying her husband is more obligatory upon her than (taking care of) her mother, unless he gives her permission. (Sharh Muntaha al-Iraadaat, 3/47). 
In al-Insaaf (8/362) it says: She does not have to obey her parents with regard to leaving her husband or visiting etc., rather obedience to the husband takes priority. 
There is a hadeeth concerning this issue which was narrated by al-Haakim from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) who said: I asked the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “Who has the most right over a woman?” He said: “Her husband.” I said, “Who has the most right over a man?” He said, “His mother.” 
But this is a weak (da’eef) hadeeth, which was classed as such by al-Albaani in Da’eef al-Targheeb wa’l-Tarheeb, 1212, and he criticized al-Mundhiri for classing it as hasan.

43138,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/43138,How the deceased is questioned in the grave,"Is the questioning of the deceased in the grave real, and does he really sit up in the grave and speak?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said:  
The questioning of the deceased in the grave is undoubtedly real, and the person sits up in his grave, speaks and is questioned. 
If someone were to ask: the grave is narrow and confined, so how can he sit up? 
The answer is: 
Firstly: 
With regard to matters of the unseen, the believer is required to accept them and believe, and not ask how or why, because no one asks about how or why except the one who has doubts. But the one who believes and whose heart is content with what Allah and His Messenger say, will accept it and say, Allah knows best about how that happens.  
Secondly: 
The connection of the soul to the body in death is different from its connection in life. The connection between body and soul may vary in ways that man cannot understand, and the body’s connection to the body after death cannot be compared to the connection in life. When a person dreams, he sees himself coming and going, travelling, speaking to people, meeting people both living and dead; he may see himself having a beautiful garden, or a dark and frightening house; he may see himself riding in a comfortable car, or riding in an uncomfortable car. All of that may happen, even though he is in his bed and nothing has changed, and even the blanket covering him has not changed, but nevertheless we feel that in a real sense. But the connection of the soul to the body after death is different to its connection when one is awake and when one is asleep. It is different and we do not understand it. So a person can sit up in his grave and be questioned, even though the grave is narrow and confined. 
Similarly this was narrated in a saheeh hadeeth from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him); he conveys the message and we have to believe and submit. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
 
“But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you (O Muhammad) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission” [al-Nisa’ 4:65]","Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 2/34"

Zaka should be given to those whom Allah has said it is for, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“As-Sadaqaat (here it means Zakah) are only for the Fuqaraa’ (poor), and Al-Masaakeen (the poor) and those employed to collect (the funds); and to attract the hearts of those who have been inclined (towards Islam); and to free the captives; and for those in debt; and for Allah’s Cause (i.e. for Mujaahidoon — those fighting in a holy battle), and for the wayfarer (a traveller who is cut off from everything); a duty imposed by Allah. And Allah is All-Knower, All-Wise” [al-Tawbah 9:60]
It should only be given to those who are obviously Muslims, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to Mu’aadh ibn Jabal when he sent him to Yemen: “Tell them that Allah has enjoined upon them charity [i.e. zakah], to be taken from their rich and given to their poor.” The more pious and righteous the poor and needy to whom it is given are, the more deserving they are than others.  
The basic principle with regard to zakah is that it should be given to the poor in the land where the wealth is, because of the hadeeth mentioned above. But if there is a need to transfer it elsewhere, such as the poor in the land to which it is transferred being in greater need, or because the giver has relatives who are poor, etc, then it is permissible to transfer it.

43147,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/43147,Reconciling the ahaadeeth about how many times better praying in congregation is than praying alone,"In Saheeh al-Bukhaari there are two ahaadeeth – numbers 645 and 646 according to the numbering of Fath al-Baari. According to hadeeth no. 645 the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Praying in congregation is twenty seven times better than praying alone”. According to hadeeth no. 646, the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Praying in congregation is twenty-five times better than praying alone.” I hope that you can comment and explain.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The first hadeeth was narrated from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar by al-Bukhaari (619) and Muslim (650). It says: “Praying in congregation is twenty seven times better than praying alone”.  
The second hadeeth was narrated from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri, and was narrated by al-Bukhaari (619). It says: “Praying in congregation is twenty-five times better than praying alone.” 
The scholars have reconciled between these two hadeeth. Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
They may be reconciled in three ways: 
1 – There is no contradiction because mentioning a smaller number does not rule out the larger number. Taking numbers literally is not acceptable according to the scholars of usool. 
2 – He first spoke of the smaller number then Allaah told him of the greater bounty so he spoke of that.  
3 – It may vary according to the circumstances of the worshippers and the prayer. So for some of them it may be twenty-five and for some it may be twenty-seven, depending on how complete their prayer is, whether it is done in the proper manner and with proper focus and humility (khushoo’), the number of people present, how good they are, how good the environment is, etc. And Allaah knows best. 
Al-Majmoo’, 4/84 
And there are other ways of reconciling the two hadeeth, some of which are based on the above. Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar suggested another way in Fath al-Baari (2/132) which was not mentioned by al-Nawawi, which is twenty-seven applies to the prayers in which Qur’aan is recited out loud and twenty-five applies to the prayers in which it is recited silently.

Will Jesus come back?","Praise be to Allah.Muslims’ Belief about Jesus
Muslims’ beliefs concerning the Messiah `Isa ibn Maryam (Jesus the son of Mary – peace be upon him) are those indicated by the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of our Messenger Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
We believe that `Isa (peace be upon him) was one of the slaves of Allah, and one of His noble Messengers. Allah sent him to the Children of Israel to call them to believe in Allah Alone and worship Him Alone . 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And (remember) when `Isa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), said: ‘O Children of Israel! I am the Messenger of Allah unto you, confirming the Tawrat [(Torah) which came] before me, and giving glad tidings of a Messenger to come after me, whose name shall be Ahmad.’ But when he (Ahmad, i.e. Muhammad) came to them with clear proofs, they said: ‘This is plain magic.’” [Al-Saff 61:6] 
“But the Messiah [`Isa (Jesus)] said: ‘O Children of Israel! Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.’ Verily, whosoever sets up partners (in worship) with Allah, then Allah has forbidden Paradise to him, and the Fire will be his abode. And for the Zalimun (polytheists and wrongdoers) there are no helpers.” [Al-Maidah 5:72]
Is Jesus God?
Jesus was not a god or the son of God as the Christians claim. 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Surely, they have disbelieved who say: ‘Allah is the Messiah [`Isa (Jesus)], son of Maryam (Mary).’” [Al-Maidah 5:72] 
“And the Jews say: ‘Uzair (Ezra) is the son of Allah, and the Christians say: Messiah is the son of Allah. That is their saying with their mouths, resembling the saying of those who disbelieved aforetime. Allah’s Curse be on them, how they are deluded away from the truth!” [Al-Tawbah 9:30]
The first words that Jesus spoke when Allah caused him to speak when he was in the cradle were (interpretation of the meaning): 
“He [`Isa (Jesus)] said: ‘Verily, I am a slave of Allah, He has given me the Scripture and made me a Prophet’” [Maryam 19:30]
Did Allah support Jesus with miracles?
We believe that Allah supported him with miracles that proved he was speaking the truth. 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“(Remember) when Allah will say (on the Day of Resurrection). ‘O `Isa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary)! Remember My Favour to you and to your mother when I supported you with Ruh-ul-Qudus [Jibril (Gabriel)] so that you spoke to the people in the cradle and in maturity; and when I taught you writing, Al-Hikmah (the power of understanding), the Tawrat (Torah) and the Injil (Gospel); and when you made out of the clay, a figure like that of a bird, by My Permission, and you breathed into it, and it became a bird by My Permission, and you healed those born blind, and the lepers by My Permission, and when you brought forth the dead by My Permission; and when I restrained the Children of Israel from you (when they resolved to kill you) as you came unto them with clear proofs, and the disbelievers among them said: This is nothing but evident magic’” [Al-Maidah 5:110]
We believe that Jesus was born from the Virgin Maryam with no father, and that is not impossible for Allah Who, when He wills a thing, says “Be!” and it is. 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, the likeness of `Isa (Jesus) before Allah is the likeness of Adam. He created him from dust, then (He) said to him: ‘Be!’ — and he was” [Aal 'Imran 3:59] 
“(Remember) when the angels said: ‘O Maryam (Mary)! Verily, Allah gives you the glad tidings of a Word [‘Be!’ — and he was! i.e. `Isa (Jesus) the son of Maryam (Mary)] from Him, his name will be the Messiah `Isa (Jesus), the son of Maryam (Mary), held in honour in this world and in the Hereafter, and will be one of those who are near to Allah.”
He will speak to the people, in the cradle and in manhood, and he will be one of the righteous.’
She said: ‘O my Lord! How shall I have a son when no man has touched me.’ He said: ‘So (it will be) for Allah creates what He wills. When He has decreed something, He says to it only: “Be!” and it is’” [Al ‘Imran 3:45-47]
We believe that he permitted to the Jews some of the things that had been forbidden to them.  
Allah tells us that `Isa said to the Children of Israel (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And I have come confirming that which was before me of the Tawrat (Torah), and to make lawful to you part of what was forbidden to you, and I have come to you with a proof from your Lord. So fear Allah and obey me” [Al ‘Imran 3:50]
Did Jesus die? 
We believe that he did not die and his enemies (the Jews) did not kill him, rather Allah saved him from them and raised him up to heaven alive. 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And because of their (Jews) disbelief and uttering against Maryam (Mary) a grave false charge (that she has committed illegal sexual intercourse);
And because of their saying (in boast), ‘We killed Messiah `Isa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), the Messenger of Allah,’ — but they killed him not, nor crucified him , but it appeared so to them the resemblance of `Isa (Jesus) was put over another man (and they killed that man)], and those who differ therein are full of doubts. They have no (certain) knowledge, they follow nothing but conjecture. For surely; they killed him not [i.e. `Isa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary)]:
But Allah raised him [`Isa (Jesus)] up (with his body and soul) unto Himself (and he is in the heavens). And Allah is Ever All-Powerful, All-Wise” [Al-Nisa 4:156-158]
We believe that he told his followers of the coming of our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And (remember) when `Isa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), said: ‘O Children of Israel! I am the Messenger of Allah unto you, confirming the Tawrat [(Torah) which came] before me, and giving glad tidings of a Messenger to come after me, whose name shall be Ahmad.’ But when he (Ahmad, i.e. Muhammad) came to them with clear proofs, they said: ‘This is plain magic’” [Al-Saff 61:6]
Will Jesus come back?
We believe that Jesus will come back down at the end of time , and will disprove the claim of his enemies, the Jews, that they killed him, and will disprove the claim of the Christians that he is God or the son of God, and he will not accept anything from them but Islam.
Al-Bukhari (2222) and Muslim (155) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “By the One in Whose hand is my soul, soon the son of Maryam will descend among you [According to another report: the Hour will not begin until the son of Maryam descends among you] as a just judge. He will break the cross, kill the pigs and abolish the jizyah, and money will become abundant until no one will accept it.”  
“Soon” means it will inevitably happen quickly. “Will descend among you” means among this ummah. “A just judge” means that he will come down and rule according to this Shari`ah (divine law), and that this Shari`ah will remain and not be abrogated, rather `Isa will be one of the rulers of this ummah. “He will break the cross and kill the pigs” means he will declare as false the religion of the Christians by breaking the cross in a real sense and proving false the Christians’ claims and veneration of the cross. 
Commenting on “and he will abolish the jizyah”, Al-Nawawi said: 
“The correct view concerning this is that he will not accept it, and he will not accept anything from the kafirs (disbelievers) but Islam. If any of them offer the jizyah that will not make him stop fighting them. Rather he will not accept anything but Islam or death. This is the view of Imam Abu Sulayman al-Khattabi and other scholars (may Allah have mercy on them).” 
 “Money will become abundant” – the reason for this abundance will be the descent of blessings and the spread of goodness because of justice and the absence of oppression or wrongdoing. At that time the earth will bring forth its treasures, and desire to keep money will decrease because they will know that that Hour is at hand. 
Then he will die and the Muslims will offer the funeral prayer for him and bury him. 
Ahmad (9349) narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I am the closest of people to `Isa ibn Maryam because there was no Prophet between him and me…” Then he mentioned his descent at the end of time. Then he said: “And he will remain for as long as Allah wills he should remain, then he will die and the Muslims will offer the funeral prayer for him and bury him.” (Classed as sahih by al-Albani in al-Silsilah al-Sahihah (2182)  
We believe that he will disavow himself on the Day of Resurrection of the claims that he was a god. 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And (remember) when Allah will say (on the Day of Resurrection): 'O `Isa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary)! Did you say unto men: Worship me and my mother as two gods besides Allah?’  He will say: ‘Glory be to You! It was not for me to say what I had no right (to say). Had I said such a thing, You would surely have known it. You know what is in my inner-self though I do not know what is in Yours; truly, You, only You, are the All-Knower of all that is hidden (and unseen).
Never did I say to them aught except what You (Allah) did command me to say: Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord. And I was a witness over them while I dwelt amongst them, but when You took me up, You were the Watcher over them; and You are a Witness to all things’” [Al-Maidah 5:116-117]
“‘Never did I say to them aught except what You (Allah) did command me to say: Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord. And I was a witness over them while I dwelt amongst them, but when You took me up, You were the Watcher over them; and You are a Witness to all things’” [Al-Maidah 5:116-117]
This is what the Muslims believe about the Messiah Jesus ibn Maryam (peace be upon him). 
Al-Bukhari (3435) and Muslim (28) narrated from ‘Ubadah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever bears witness that there is no god but Allah Alone, with no partner or associate, and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger, and that `Isa is His slave and Messenger, a word which Allah bestowed upon Maryam and a spirit created by Him, and that Paradise is real, and Hell is real, Allah will admit him through whichever of the eight gates of Paradise he wishes.” 
We ask Allah to make us steadfast in faith and to cause us to die as believers.

43160,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/43160,Benefitting from what the kaafirs have,How can we benefit from what the kaafirs have without falling into anything forbidden in Islam? Does the concept of masaalih mursalah [things that serve the general interests of the Muslims] come under this heading?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The actions of the enemies of Allaah and our enemies, the kuffaar, fall into three categories: 
1 – Acts of worship
2 – Customs
3 – Manufacturing and work  
With regard to acts of worship, it is well known that it is not permissible for any Muslim to imitate them in their acts of worship. Whoever imitates them in their acts of worship puts himself at great risk and that may lead to him becoming a kaafir who is beyond the pale of Islam. 
With regard to customs such as dress etc., it is haraam to imitate them because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.” 
With regard to manufacturing and professions: in the case of those which serve a general interest, there is nothing wrong with us learning from what they do and benefitting from it. This does not come under the heading of imitating them, rather it is a kind of sharing in beneficial actions and the one who does that is not regarded as imitating them. 
With regard to the questioner’s saying, “Does the concept of masaalih mursalah [things that serve the general interests of the Muslims] come under this heading?” we say that masaalih mursalah should not be taken into consideration on its own, rather we say that if we are certain that a particular matter comes under the heading of these things that serve the general interests of the Muslims [masaalih mursalah], then there should be shar’i evidence to that effect, and thus it is part of sharee’ah. 
But if sharee’ah proves that this matter is not acceptable, then is does not come under the category of masaalih mursalah, even if the one who accepts it claims that it does. 
If it is neither one nor the other, then we should refer to the basic principle. If they are acts of worship, then the basic principle is that acts of worship are forbidden; if they are not acts of worship then the basic principle is that they are permissible. Thus it is clear that this concept of masaalih mursalah cannot be taken into consideration on its own.","From Majmoo’ Fataawa Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 3/40"
43162,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/43162,The connection between zakaah and the economic system and social security,"Is Zakah an Islamic Economic System or Social Security? If not, then what is the Islamic Economic System? Q. What is the Islamic Social Security? Zakah? When do I qualify to receive State Benefit from an Islamic or Kufr State?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.There is no definition of the Islamic economic system mentioned in the Qur’aan or Sunnah, rather Islam explains everything that has to do with the Muslim’s life in its texts, including his economic affairs. 
The Islamic economic system may be defined as a collection of general economic principles which are derived from the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and the economic structure that is based on those principles. 
Or it may be described as the system which directs and organizes economic activity and regulates it according to the principles and economic policies of Islam. 
One of the basic principles that was brought by Islam is the individual’s right to ownership (of goods and property), and the prohibition on aggression against the property of others. It is also permissible to make use of what is in the earth; and riba (usury, interest), gambling and zulm (wrongdoing, oppression) are all forbidden. 
Among the forms of economic activity that are based on these foundations are: permissible financial transactions, partnerships, mudaarabah (partnership whereby one supplies capital and another provides labour), renting, muzaara’ah (where one person supplies land and another cultivates it), and various forms of permissible investment. 
As zakaah is a means of money passing from the hands of one person to another, who may benefit from it and dispose of it, and this is regulated by the general principles that are derived from the Qur’aan and Sunnah, we may say that in this sense zakaah is indeed a part of the Islamic economic system; there are texts which explain the kinds of wealth on which zakaah is to be paid and the amounts due, and those to whom zakaah may be given, and how it is to be paid. All that is well known. 
It is also one of the means of achieving “social security”, but in Islam social security is not limited solely to zakaah, rather it is also achieved by other means, such as sadaqah (charity), waqfs, war booty and stipends from the bayt al-maal (Muslim treasury). 
Muslim society gives guidelines to both rich and poor; it encourages the rich to give and enjoins upon them the zakaah of their wealth. Thus it ensures that the poor and needy and those who are unable to work, such as the elderly, widows and others, have enough to live on. Hence Islam made zakaah an obligation, one of the five pillars of Islam, and encourages Muslims to give charity, establish waqfs, and leave money to good causes in their wills, and it lists the poor as one of the  groups to whom zakaah and money offered as expiation are to be given – such as expiations offered for zihaar (a jaahili form of divorce in which the husband says to his wife, “You are to me as my mother’s back”), for broken oaths and broken fasts, and the fidyah to be offered for certain transgressions during the Hajj, so that the number of poor people in the Muslim society may be reduced. 
In the Muslim state, if a person is unable to work and earn a living and has no one such as a father, mother or other relative to spend on him, and reason for his being unable to earn a living is that he is too young or too sick or too old, he is entitled to assistance. Some Muslim states have set up a system for providing assistance, according to various criteria, such as pensions, spending on children whose parents have died until they reach the age of discernment, and so on, even if they have money of their own. 
Other non-Muslim states, on the other hand, have set up systems and special criteria that deal with the issue of assistance. 
The Muslim should be keen to earn a living from halaal sources by working with his own hands. He should be the one who gives and spends, not the one who takes and asks, especially if he is asking for money in a kaafir state. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The best of charity is that which leaves you still independent of means, and the upper hand (the one that gives) is better than the lower hand (the one that receives), and start with those who are under your care.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5040; Muslim, 1034.

43164,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/43164,Praying for kaafirs to be guided,"In the answer to question no. 4569 , I read that the shaykh was making du’aa’ that the Raafidis be guided. Is this appropriate? Because it is not permissible to pray for the mushrikeen.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
We thank our brother for his interest and for this question about something that is confusing him in some of the answers. 
Secondly: 
For more information on rulings concerning the Raafidis and some of their views, please see question no. 1148 . 
Thirdly: 
Praying for forgiveness for the mushrikeen is undoubtedly haram, as is indicated by the Quran and Sunnah. 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“It is not (proper) for the Prophet and those who believe to ask Allah’s forgiveness for the Mushrikoon, even though they be of kin, after it has become clear to them that they are the dwellers of the Fire (because they died in a state of disbelief).
And Ibraaheem’s (Abraham) invoking (of Allah) for his father’s forgiveness was only because of a promise he [Ibraaheem (Abraham)] had made to him (his father). But when it became clear to him that he (his father) is an enemy of Allah, he dissociated himself from him. Verily, Ibraaheem was Awwah (one who invokes Allah with humility, glorifies Him and remembers Him much) and was forbearing” [al-Tawbah 9:113-114]
al-Sa’di (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
This means, it is not appropriate or good for the Prophet and those who believe in him to “ask Allah’s forgiveness for the mushrikeen”, i.e. for those who disbelieve in Him and worship others alongside Him. “even though they be of kin, after it has become clear to them that they are the dwellers of the Fire”  
Although the Close Friend of the Most Merciful, Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) prayed for forgiveness for his father, that was “was only because of a promise he [Ibraaheem (Abraham)] had made to him (his father)” – when he said, “I will ask forgiveness of my Lord for you. Verily, He is unto me Ever Most Gracious” [Maryam 19:47 – interpretation of the meaning] which was before he knew of his father’s fate.
When it became clear to Ibraaheem that his father was an enemy of Allah who would die in kufr, and his preaching and reminding was not going to be of any avail, he disowned him, in order to please his Lord.  
“Verily, Ibraaheem was Awwah (one who invokes Allah with humility, glorifies Him and remembers Him much)” means, he turned to his Lord in all his affairs, making a lot of dhikr and du’aa’ and always praying for forgiveness. 
“and was forbearing” means, he was compassionate towards people and was tolerant towards their mistakes; he was not provoked by the attitude of the ignorant, and he did not retaliate in kind against those who offended him. His father said to him, “I will indeed stone you” and he said to him, “Peace be on you! I will ask forgiveness of my Lord for you. Verily, He is unto me Ever Most Gracious” [Maryam 19:47 – interpretation of the meaning]
Al-Bukhari (3884) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) called his paternal uncle Abu Taalib to Islam when he was dying, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I will pray for forgiveness for you so long as I am not forbidden to do so.” Then the following verses were revealed (interpretation of the meaning): 
“It is not (proper) for the Prophet and those who believe to ask Allah’s forgiveness for the Mushrikoon, even though they be of kin, after it has become clear to them that they are the dwellers of the Fire (because they died in a state of disbelief).” [al-Tawbah 9:113] 
 “Verily, you (O Muhammad) guide not whom you like” [al-Qasas 28:56] 
Al-Haafiz said: 
“So long as I am not forbidden to do so” means, so long as I am not forbidden to pray for forgiveness.  
Muslim (976) narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I asked my Lord for permission to pray for forgiveness for my mother, and He did not give me permission. I asked Him for permission to visit her grave, and He granted me permission.” 
Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
This indicates that it is forbidden to pray for forgiveness for the kuffaar. 
It is clear from these two ahaadeeth that this prohibition applies to praying for forgiveness for them. The same applies to praying for them to be admitted to Paradise and saved from torment. 
The reason for this prohibition is: 
“That seeking forgiveness for them in this case (i.e., when it is clear that they are dwellers of the Fire) is a mistake and is of no use, so it is not befitting for the Prophet and the believers to do this, because if they (the mushrikeen) have died in shirk or it is known that they will die in shirk, then the word of punishment has been fulfilled against them and they will abide forever in Hell, and the intercession of those who intercede and the prayers of forgiveness of those who pray will be to no avail. 
Moreover, the Prophet (S) and those who believe with him are obliged to like that which pleases their Lord and hate that which angers Him; they have to take as friends those whom Allah takes as friends and regard as enemies those whom Allah regards as enemies, so praying for forgiveness for those who are clearly dwellers of the Fire goes against that and contradicts it.” 
~ Shaykh al-Sa’di (may Allah have mercy on him). 
But praying for the kaafirs to be guided is not included in the prohibition on praying for forgiveness for them. 
It is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed for some of the kuffaar to be guided. 
Al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) said in al-Saheeh: “Chapter on making du’aa’ for the mushrikeen to be guided so that their hearts may be softened.” Then he mentioned the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: “Al-Tufayl ibn ‘Amr came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said. ‘[The tribe of] Daws has rebelled and rejected [Islam]. Pray to Allah against them.’ He said, ‘O Allah, guide Daws and bring them here.’” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2937; Muslim, 2524). 
Al-Haafiz said in Fath al-Baari: 
Al-Bukhari mentioned the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah according to which al-Tufayl ibn ‘Amr al-Dawsi came (to the Prophet) and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ‘O Allah, guide Daws and bring them here.’ The phrase “so that their hearts may be softened” indicates that the compiler [i.e., al-Bukhari] understood the variations in the Prophet’s attitude, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sometimes prayed against the kuffaar and sometimes prayed for them. He did the former when they were strong and able to do more to the Muslims, and he did the latter when they were not causing any harm to the Muslims and there was the hope that they might enter Islam, as in the story of Daws. 
Al-Tirmidhi narrated (2739) that Abu Moosa al-Ash’ari said: The Jews used to sneeze in the presence of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), hoping that he would say to them, “Yarhamakum Allah (may Allah have mercy on you).” But he would say, “Yahdeekum Allah wa yuslihu baalakum) (may Allah guide you and reform you).” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
Al-Haafiz said: 
The hadeeth of Abu Moosa indicates that they (the kuffaar) are included in the general command to pray for one who sneezes, but there is a special prayer for them in this case, which is to pray that they be guided and reformed, and there is nothing wrong with that. This is different from the prayer said for Muslims when they sneeze, for they are the ones for whom one should pray for mercy, unlike the kuffaar.

Examine why your husband treats you badly","Praise be to Allah.How to treat your wife
The husband has to treat his wife in a good and kind manner , and to spend on her food, drink, clothing and accommodation . Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and live with them honourably.” [al-Nisa 4:19] 
“And they (women) have rights (over their husbands as regards living expenses) similar (to those of their husbands) over them (as regards obedience and respect) to what is reasonable, but men have a degree (of responsibility) over them. And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.” [al-Baqarah 2:228] 
Ahmad (20025) and Abu Dawud (2142) narrated that Mu’awiyah ibn Haydah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I said, “O Messenger of Allah, what are the rights of the wife of any one of us over him?” He said: “That you should feed her when you feed yourself, clothe her when you clothe yourself, you should not hit her on the face, you should not curse her and you should not forsake her except in the house.”
Al-Albani said concerning this hadith in Sahih Abi Dawud: “(It is) hasan sahih.” 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) enjoined good treatment of women in more than one hadith. Hence the husband has to fear Allah with regard to his wife, and give each person his or her rights. 
Does honouring parents conflict with treating a wife kindly?
Honouring one's parents and upholding the ties of kinship do not conflict with treating one's wife kindly and honouring her and taking care of her.  The best that can be mentioned concerning that is the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “The best of you is the one who is best to his family, and I am the best of you to my family.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3895) and Ibn Majah, 1977; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi) 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) regarded being kind to one's family as being the criterion with regard to who is best. Whoever wants to be one of the best of the Muslims should be kind to his family, which includes being kind to one’s wife, children and relatives. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “You will never spend anything, seeking thereby the Face of Allah, but you will be rewarded for it, even (the food) that you put in your wife’s mouth.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 56) 
Examine why your husband treats you badly
You should examine the reasons for the shortcomings in the way he treats you; perhaps that is due to a shortcoming on your part with respect to his rights; perhaps you do not pay attention to him, or adorn yourself for him, or hasten to meet his needs. 
You should be more patient, because there is a lot of good in being patient and it brings a great deal of reward. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and be patient. Surely, Allah is with those who are patient.” [al-Anfal 8:46] 
“Verily, he who fears Allah with obedience to Him (by abstaining from sins and evil deeds, and by performing righteous good deeds), and is patient, then surely, Allah makes not the reward of the good-doers to be lost.” [Yusuf 12:90] 
“So be patient. Surely, the (good) end is for the pious.” [Hud 11:49]

    Seeing Allaah in this world is definitely not possible. The 
    evidence for that is the fact that Moosa, who was one of the greatest 
    Messengers and one of the five Messengers of strong will said: “ ‘O my 
    Lord! Show me (Yourself), that I may look upon You’” Allaah said to him:
    “ ‘You cannot see Me, but look upon the mountain; if it stands still in 
    its place then you shall see Me.’ So when his Lord appeared to the 
    mountain, He made it collapse to dust.” So the mountain crumbled before 
    Moosa as he was looking on, and “Moosa (Moses) fell down unconscious” 
    So he lost consciousness, because he was watching something that he could 
    not bear. “Then when he recovered his senses he said: ‘Glory be to You, I 
    turn to You in repentance and I am the first of the believers.’” 
    [Quotations from al-A’raaf 7:143 – interpretation of the meaning]. So he 
    repented to Allaah for having asked this question, because it was asking for 
    something that was not possible, and Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “Invoke your Lord with humility and in secret. He likes 
    not the aggressors”

    [al-A’raaf 7:55]
Seeing Allaah in this 
    world when one is awake is something that is not possible. Even the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) on the night of the Mi’raaj 
    (ascent into heaven) did not see his Lord. He was asked ‘Did you see your 
    Lord?’ He said, “I saw Light.” According to another report: “Light – how 
    could I see Him?” i.e., between me and Him there was a great veil of light. 
    According to a hadeeth in al-Saheeh, it is narrated that Allaah is 
    veiled in Light. That appears in the hadeeth in which the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “His veil is Light and if 
    He were to remove it, the glory of His Countenance would burn everything of 
    His creation, as far as His gaze reaches.” Because His sight reaches 
    everything, and everything would be burned by this immense Light. Based on 
    this, we say that it is not possible to see Allaah in this world when one is 
    awake. 

    As for dreams, the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) saw his Lord in a dream, but is it possible for anyone 
    else to see Him? It is narrated that Imam Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on 
    him) saw his Lord, and some of the scholars said that this is possible. And 
    Allaah knows best. But I am afraid to open the door to Sufi shaykhs and 
    others who will start saying, “I saw my Lord last night and we chatted and 
    talked together,” then he will come up with myths and lies for which there

“And round about them

    them scattered pearls”
    [al-Insaan :19] 
Ibn Katheer (may Allaah 
    have mercy on him) said: This means that some of the children of Paradise 
    will go around to serve the people of Paradise. Mukhalladoon 
    (translated here as “immortal” and as “of everlasting youth”) means that 
    they will appear in one form which will never change; they will not grow 
    older than that age. Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: They 
    are young boys who will never die. 
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah 
    have mercy on him) said: Abu ‘Ubaydah and al-Fara’ said: Mukhalladoon 
    means that they will not grow old or change. If a man has grown old and has 
    not turned grey, the Arabs describe him as mukhallad; or if a man 
    still has his teeth when he has grown old, they call him mukhallad. 
The verse in Soorat 
    al-Insaan, where Allaah describes them as (interpretation of the meaning): 
“If you see them, you would think them 
    scattered pearls”
[al-Insaan 76:19]
means, if you saw them 
    as they go about tending to their masters’ needs, because there are so many 
    of them, their faces are so bright and their colours and their garments are 
    so beautiful, you would think that they were scattered pearls. There can be 
    no more beautiful comparison or more beautiful scene than pearls scattered 
    in a place of beauty. 
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah 
    have mercy on him) said: Allaah likens them to scattered pearls because of 
    their whiteness and beautiful appearance. 
The fact that they are 
    scattered means two things: 
1 – It indicates that they 
    are not idle, rather they are moving about, serving and tending to the 
    people’s needs 
2 – If pearls are 
    scattered, especially against a background of gold or silk, it enhances 
    their beauty more than if they are gathered in one place. 
The scholars differed as to 
    who these boys are. 
It was narrated from ‘Ali 
    ibn Abi Taalib (may Allaah be pleased with him) and al-Hasan al-Basri that 
    what is meant by these boys is the children of the Muslims who died in 
    infancy and have no good or bad deeds on their records. 
It was narrated that 
    Salmaan (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The children of the 
    mushrikeen are the servants of the people of Paradise. 
Al-Hasan said: They have no 
    good deeds for which they are to be rewarded and no bad deeds for which they 
    are to be punished, so they are put in this situation.  
Shaykh al-Islam (may Allaah 
    have mercy on him) said: There is no basis for this opinion. Majmoo’ 
    al-Fataawa, 4/279 
Ibn al-Qayyim (may 
    Allaah have mercy on him) said: A hadeeth was narrated concerning that which 
    cannot be proven. 
And it was said that these 
    boys are created by Allaah for the people of Paradise, to go around among 
    them as He wills, without being born (in the usual manner). 
This final view is the one 
    which was favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on 
    him). He was asked about these boys:  Are they the children of the people of 
    Paradise? 
He replied: The boys who 
    will go around among the people of Paradise are among those who are created 
    for Paradise; they are not the children of people of this world. Rather if 
    the children of people of this world enter Paradise, they will given a 
    perfect form like the other people of Paradise, in the form of Adam, aged 
    thirty-three and sixty cubits tall. It was also narrated that their width 
    will be seven cubits. 
See Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 
    4/312. 
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah 
    have mercy on him) also preferred this view and said: It is most likely that 
    these boys will be created from Paradise, like al-hoor al-‘ayn, as servants 
    for them… They are not their children. By Allaah's grace He will cause their 
    children to be served alongside them, not to become servants to them.
