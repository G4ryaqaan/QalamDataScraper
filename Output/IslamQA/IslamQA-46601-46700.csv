46601,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/46601,The fate of the Shaytaan on the Day of Resurrection,What will happen to the shaitaan after the day of resuruction?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.The fate of the Shaytaan on the Day of Resurrection will be the worst and most horrible of fates – we seek refuge with Allaah – as is indicated by a great deal of evidence from the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Allaah has stated that the Shaytaan is one of the kaafirs (disbelievers) as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
‘And (remember) when We said to the angels: “Prostrate yourselves before Adam.” And they prostrated except Iblees (Satan), he refused and was proud and was one of the disbelievers (disobedient to Allaah)’
[al-Baqarah 2:34] 
And the fate of the disbelievers will be Hell, what a miserable abode. 
Allaah tells us that His curse is upon the Shaytaan until the Day of Resurrection, and that He will fill Hell with him and his followers. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
‘And surely, We created you (your father Adam) and then gave you shape (the noble shape of a human being); then We told the angels, “Prostrate yourselves to Adam”, and they prostrated themselves, except Iblees (Satan), he refused to be of those who prostrated themselves.
12. (Allaah) said: “What prevented you (O Iblees) that you did not prostrate yourself, when I commanded you?” Iblees said: “I am better than him (Adam), You created me from fire, and him You created from clay.”
13. (Allaah) said: “(O Iblees) get down from this (Paradise), it is not for you to be arrogant here. Get out, for you are of those humiliated and disgraced.”
14. (Iblees) said: “Allow me respite till the Day they are raised up (i.e. the Day of Resurrection).”
15. (Allaah) said: “You are of those respited.”
16. (Iblees) said: “Because You have sent me astray, surely, I will sit in wait against them (human beings) on Your straight path.
17. “Then I will come to them from before them and behind them, from their right and from their left, and You will not find most of them as thankful ones (i.e. they will not be dutiful to You).”
18. (Allaah) said (to Iblees): “Get out from this (Paradise), disgraced and expelled. Whoever of them (mankind) will follow you, then surely, I will fill Hell with you all.”’
[al-A’raaf 7:11-18]
Allaah tells us what the Shaytaan said when he was informed that he would be expelled and cast away from the mercy of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): 
‘[Iblees (Satan)] said: “By Your Might, then I will surely, mislead them all,
83. “Except Your chosen slaves amongst them (i.e. faithful, obedient, true believers of Islamic Monotheism).”
84. (Allaah) said: “The truth is — and the truth I say
85. That I will fill Hell with you [Iblees (Satan)] and those of them (mankind) that follow you, together.”’
[Saad 38:82-85]
And there are other verses which describe the fate of the Shaytaan on the Day of Resurrection. 
Allaah tells us that the Shaytaan will disown his followers on the Day of Resurrection. He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
‘And Shaytaan (Satan) will say when the matter has been decided: “Verily, Allaah promised you a promise of truth. And I too promised you, but I betrayed you. I had no authority over you except that I called you, and you responded to me. So blame me not, but blame yourselves. I cannot help you, nor can you help me. I deny your former act in associating me (Satan) as a partner with Allaah (by obeying me in the life of the world). Verily, there is a painful torment for the Zaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers).”’
[Ibraaheem 14:22]
Let the wise beware lest they become followers of the Shaytaan, for his followers are the people of Hell – as stated in the verses quoted above – and the Shaytaan ‘only invites his Hizb (followers) that they may become the dwellers of the blazing Fire’ [Faatir 35:6 – interpretation of the meaning]. 
‘They are the party of Shaytaan (Satan). Verily, it is the party of Shaytaan (Satan) that will be the losers!’
[al-Mujaadilah 58:19– interpretation of the meaning].
Hence Allaah has commanded us to regard him as our enemy and to fight him, and to beware of obeying him and following in his footsteps. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
‘Surely, Shaytaan (Satan) is an enemy to you, so take (treat) him as an enemy’
[Faatir 35:6] 
‘Did I not command you, O Children of Adam, that you should not worship Shaytaan (Satan). Verily, he is a plain enemy to you’
[Yaa-Seen 36:60] 
‘O mankind! Eat of that which is lawful and good on the earth, and follow not the footsteps of Shaytaan (Satan). Verily, he is to you an open enemy’
[al-Baqarah 2:168]
‘O you who believe! Follow not the footsteps of Shaytaan (Satan). And whosoever follows the footsteps of Shaytaan (Satan), then, verily, he commands Al-Fahsha’ [i.e. to commit indecency (illegal sexual intercourse)], and Al-Munkar [disbelief and polytheism (i.e. to do evil and wicked deeds; and to speak or to do what is forbidden in Islam)]’
[al-Noor 24:21]
We ask Allaah to grant us refuge from the accursed Shaytaan. 
And Allaah knows best.",Islam Q&A
46623,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/46623,She became Muslim recently and feels anxious about the future,"I am a muslim convert. I try to prey veryday and read quran,but I have always full of worries about future like something bad thing may happen to me etc.,especially at night. Can you pleases tell me what to do?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
We congratulate you for this great blessing that Allaah has bestowed upon you, which is the blessing of entering Islam and finding enjoyment praying and reading Qur’aan. 
Secondly: 
You should try hard to offer the obligatory prayers at the right times as defined in sharee’ah. There are five prayers each day and night. Prayer represents connection and conversation between a person and his Lord. It is the most important pillar and obligatory duty of Islam after the Shahaadatayn (twin testimony of faith), and it brings light to a person in this life and in his grave in the Hereafter. 
You should also strive to offer nafl (supererogatory) prayers after doing the obligatory prayers, for Allaah says in the hadeeth qudsi: “My slave does not draw near to Me with anything more loved by Me than the religious duties I have enjoined upon him, and My slave continues to draw near to Me with supererogatory works so that I shall love him.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 6502. 
Thirdly: 
The anxiety and fear that you are feeling about the future are things that happen to some people when they first become committed in their adherence to Islam. Perhaps the reason for that is that the Shaytaan is annoyed by the person’s beginning to follow true guidance and the path of Mercy, so he tried to divert him from that, and he whispers to him doubts about Allaah that are not appropriate, in order to cause him grief and worry. This – praise be to Allaah – will not harm the believer. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, when some of his companions complained to him about the waswasah (whisperings from the Shaytaan) that they were encountering: “Allaah is Most Great, Allaah is Most Great, Allaah is Most Great. Praise be to Allaah Who has reduced his (the Shaytaan’s) plots to mere whispers.” Narrated by Ahmad (2097) and Abu Dawood (4448); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. A similar hadeeth is to be found in al-Saheehayn. 
You should read Qur’aan a great deal and remember Allaah (dhikr), for no one ever protects himself against the Shaytaan with anything like remembrance of Allaah, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, especially the dhikrs that are narrated for specific times and occasions, such as the dhikrs for morning and evening, for sleeping and waking, for going out of the house and coming in. You should also cleanse the house of anything that may prevent the angels coming in, such as dogs and images. 
Remember that the future is in the hand of Allaah and that whatever Allaah has decreed will come to pass. Your fear and anxiety about it will not change it at all. So keep busy with things that will benefit you and think well of Allaah, for Allaah is as His slave thinks He is, as He says in the hadeeth qudsi: “I am as My slave thinks I am. I am with him when he makes mention of Me. If he makes mention of Me to himself, I make mention of him to Myself; and if he makes mention of Me in an assembly, I make mention ofhim in an assembly better than it.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 7066; Muslim, 2675). Ahmad (16059) narrated with a saheeh isnaad: “I am as My slave thinks I am, so let him think of Me as he wishes.” 
So think that Allaah will honour you, have mercy on you and give you happiness in this world and in the Hereafter, because He loves His righteous slaves, and honours His pious slaves. You – praise be to Allaah – are new in Islam and have few sins to your record. So be assured of a life of tranquillity, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Whoever works righteousness — whether male or female — while he (or she) is a true believer (of Islamic Monotheism) verily, to him We will give a good life (in this world with respect, contentment and lawful provision), and We shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion to the best of what they used to do (i.e. Paradise in the Hereafter)”
[al-Nahl 16:97]
We ask Allaah to guide you and give you strength, and to take away the fear and anxiety that you are experiencing.

Or should I leave it, knowing that it has been allocated in the budget in my name, and all I have to do is go and collect it? Please advise me, may Allaah reward you with good.",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not 
    permissible for you to take the relocation costs when you are not going to 
    relocate. What you have to do is to leave that money alone and not collect 
    it. You also have to tell the people in charge that you are not entitled to 
    this money. Perhaps by doing that you will set a good example to your 
    colleagues. 
Strive to 
    ensure your food is good [from halaal sources], for Allaah has enjoined upon 
    the believers that which He has enjoined upon the Messengers, which is to 
    eat of good [halaal] things and to do righteous deeds. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O 
    (you) Messengers! Eat of the Tayyibaat [all kinds of Halaal (lawful) foods 
    which Allaah has made lawful (meat of slaughtered eatable animals, milk 
    products, fats, vegetables, fruits)] and do righteous deeds. Verily, I am 
    Well-Acquainted with what you do”

    [al-Mumin’oon 23:51] 
“O you 
    who believe (in the Oneness of Allaah — Islamic Monotheism)! Eat of the 
    lawful things that We have provided you with, and be grateful to Allaah, if 
    it is indeed He Whom you worship”

    [al-Baqarah 2:172]
And the Prophet 
    SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Every body that is 
    nourished from haraam sources, the Fire is more suited to it.” Narrated by 
    al-Tabaraani and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’. 
And Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may 
    Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: I am an employee   working in a 
    government department, and sometimes we are paid overtime by the 
    administration, without us been asked to do any overtime and without us 
    coming to work. They regard it as an occasional bonus for the employees, and 
    the boss knows about that and approves of it. Is it permissible to take this 
    money? If it is not permissible, then what should I do about the money that 
    I have taken previously, noting that I have spent it? 
He replied:  If the 
    situation is as you describe, that is a reprehensible action which is not 
    permitted. Rather it is a kind of betrayal. You have to return the money 
    that you have taken in this manner to the state treasury. If you cannot do 
    that, then you have to give it in charity to the poor Muslims or to 
    charitable projects, as well as repenting to Allaah, and you must resolve 
    sincerely not to do that again, because it is not permissible for a Muslim 
    to take something from the Bayt al-Maal (treasury) of the Muslims except in 
    ways that are permitted in sharee’ah, and that are known to and approved of by the state.

46665,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/46665,He wants to give his wife a gift on the anniversary of their marriage each year,Is it permissible for me to give a gift to my wife on the anniversary of our wedding each year?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    If the husband wants to give his wife a gift, he should give 
    it at any time or on any appropriate occasion or when there is a reason for 
    doing so. He should not wait for the anniversary of their wedding to give 
    her a gift, because that implies that he is taking this day as an “Eid” (an 
    occasion that is celebrated regularly), and there are no annual Eids for the 
    Muslims except Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha. These occasions – wedding 
    anniversaries – came to the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) and his companions, and the salaf (early generations) of this 
    ummah and its imams, but there is no report that they used to give gifts to 
    their wives on these days. And all goodness is to be found in following 
    them. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) was 
    asked: is it permissible for the husband to give a gift to his wife on their 
    wedding anniversary each year, as a renewal of the love between them, noting 
    that this anniversary will be marked only by the giving of this gift and 
    that the couple are not going to celebrate this occasion? 

    He said: 

    What I think is that this should not be done, because this 
    year it may be just a gift, but next year it may become a celebration. 
    Moreover, marking this occasion with a gift is regarded as making it an 
    ‘Eid’, because the Eid is that which is repeated. Love does not need to be 
    renewed every year, rather it should be renewed all the time, every time the 
    woman sees something of her husband that makes her happy, and every time the 
    man sees something of his wife that makes him happy, then the love between 
    them will be renewed.

He agreed with his fiancée to bring the jeweller to the house in order to please her family, then the young man will return the traditional set of jewellery to the jeweller one month after the celebration, in return for the groom paying the jeweller for renting this set for this one-month period, according to the price set by the jeweller. Is this regarded as riba? Is this haraam or halaal, because the young man’s marriage to this girl depends on his bringing this jewellery because her family are insisting on that? May Allaah reward you with good.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
The Standing Committee was asked a similar question, about renting gold and silver jewellery for the woman to wear for her wedding, then returning it two weeks later, for example, and paying for that. They replied: 
The basic principle is that it is permissible to rent gold and silver jewellery for one of the two currencies, or for something else, for a known rent and period of time, after which the one who rents the jewellery is to return it. And there is nothing wrong with taking collateral for that. 
Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 15/79-80 
The two currencies are gold and silver, i.e., it is permissible to pay the rental fee in gold or silver, or in the banknotes that people use nowadays. And Allaah knows best. 
Secondly: 
Women’s fathers and guardians are advised not to make excessive demands with regard to the mahr (dowry), and not to burden prospective husbands with unreasonable demands as regards the mahr, traditional set of jewellery and furniture, etc. Such excessive demands are condemned in sharee’ah, as are the harmful consequences to which they lead.

46683,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/46683,Acceptance of repentance,I have committed a great sin and I prayed to Allah and asked Him to forgive me. Will my repentance from that sin be accepted? I feel that my repentance has not been accepted and that Allah is angry with me. Are there any indications that repentance has been accepted?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: Making mistakes and falling short are undoubtedly part of human nature and no one will be free of shortcomings in his obedience to Allah, or free of mistakes or forgetfulness or sins. All of us fall short, commit sins, and make mistakes. Sometimes we turn to Allah and sometimes we turn away from Him. Sometimes we remember that Allah is watching and sometimes we become negligent. None of us is free of sin, and we will inevitably make mistakes. We are not infallible. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “By the One in Whose hand is my soul, if you did not commit sin Allah would do away with you and bring people who would commit sin then pray for forgiveness.” Narrated by Muslim, 2749. And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Every son of Adam sins, and the best of those who sin are those who repent.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2499; classed as hasan by al-Albaani. 
By His mercy towards weak man, Allah has opened the gate of repentance to him, and has commanded him to turn to Him, every time sin overwhelms him. Were it not for that, man would suffer a great deal of hardship and would not have the drive to draw closer to his Lord; he would lose all hope of His forgiveness and pardon. Repentance is something that is necessary as a result of man’s shortcomings and human failings. 
Allah has enjoined repentance on all kinds of people in this ummah: those who are foremost in good deeds, those who follow a middle course, and those who wrong their own selves by doing haraam things (cf. Faatir 35:32). 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And all of you beg Allah to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful”
[al-Noor 24:31] 
“O you who believe! Turn to Allah with sincere repentance!”
[al-Tahreem 66:8]
And the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “O people, repent to Allah and seek His forgiveness, for I repent one hundred times a day.” Narrated by Muslim, 2702 from the hadeeth of al-Agharr al-Muzani (may Allah be pleased with him). 
Allah has bestowed His mercy and encompassed His slaves with his kindness. He is Forbearing and does not punish us or destroy us straightaway, rather He gives us respite, and He commanded His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to proclaim His generosity: 
“Say: O ‘Ibaadi (My slaves) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allah, verily, Allah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful”
[al-Zumar 39:53 – interpretation of the meaning].
And He says, out of kindness towards His slaves (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Will they not turn with repentance to Allah and ask His forgiveness? For Allah is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful”
[al-Maa'idah 5:74]
“And verily, I am indeed forgiving to him who repents, believes (in My Oneness, and associates none in worship with Me) and does righteous good deeds, and then remains constant in doing them (till his death)”
[Ta-Ha 20:82] 
“And those who, when they have committed Faahishah (illegal sexual intercourse) or wronged themselves with evil, remember Allah and ask forgiveness for their sins; — and none can forgive sins but Allah — and do not persist in what (wrong) they have done, while they know”
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:135]
“And whoever does evil or wrongs himself but afterwards seeks Allah’s forgiveness, he will find Allah Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful”
[al-Nisa’ 4:110]
Allah calls to repentance those who committed the gravest form of shirk and sin, those who say that ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) is the son of God – exalted be Allah far above what the wrongdoers say. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Will they not turn with repentance to Allah and ask His forgiveness? For Allah is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful”
[al-Maa’idah 5:74]
And He opens the door of repentance to the hypocrites, who are worse than the kuffaar who openly show their kufr. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, the hypocrites will be in the lowest depth (grade) of the Fire; no helper will you find for them.
146. Except those who repent (from hypocrisy), do righteous good deeds, hold fast to Allah, and purify their religion for Allah (by worshipping none but Allah, and do good for Allah’s sake only, not to show off), then they will be with the believers. And Allah will grant the believers a great reward”
[al-Nisa’ 4:145-146]
One of the attributes of the Lord is that He accepts repentance and rejoices over it by His grace. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And He it is Who accepts repentance from His slaves, and forgives sins, and He knows what you do”
[al-Shoora 42:25]
“Know they not that Allah accepts repentance from His slaves and takes the Sadaqaat (alms, charity), and that Allah Alone is the One Who forgives and accepts repentance, Most Merciful?”
[al-Tawbah 9:104]
It was narrated that Abu Hamzah Anas ibn Maalik al-Ansaari (may Allah be pleased with him), the servant of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah rejoices more over the repentance of His slave than any one of you who finds his camel after having lost it in a desolate land.” Agreed upon.  
According to a report narrated by Muslim (2747): “Allah rejoices more over the repentance of His slave than any one of you if he is on his camel in a desolate land, then it runs away from him and on it is his food and drink, and he despairs of finding it, so he goes to a tree and lies down in its shade, having despaired of finding his camel, then while he is like that, it suddenly appears in front of him and he takes hold of its reins and says, because of his intense joy, ‘O Allah, You are my slave and I am your lord,’ making this mistake because of the intensity of his joy.”  
It was narrated from Abu Moosa ‘Abd-Allah ibn Qays al-Ash’ari (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah spreads out His hand at night to accept the repentance of the one who sinned during the day, and He spreads out His hand by day to accept the repentance of the one who sinned during the night, (and that will continue) until the sun rises from the west.” Narrated by Muslim, 2759. 
It was narrated from Abu ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah will accept the repentance of His slave so long as the death-rattle has not yet reached his throat.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3537; classed as hasan by al-Albaani. 
Secondly: The blessings of repentance come in this world and in the Hereafter, some are visible and some are hidden. The rewards of repentance are: purity of heart, erasing of sins and increasing of hasanaat (good deeds). Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Turn to Allah with sincere repentance! It may be that your Lord will expiate from you your sins, and admit you into Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise) the Day that Allah will not disgrace the Prophet (Muhammad) and those who believe with him. Their Light will run forward before them and (with their Records Books of deeds) in their right hands. They will say: ‘Our Lord! Keep perfect our Light for us [and do not put it off till we cross over the Siraat (a slippery bridge over the Hell) safely] and grant us forgiveness. Verily, You are Able to do all things’”
[al-Tahreem 66:8]
The reward of repentance is a good life in the shade of faith, contentment, peace of mind and tranquility. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Seek the forgiveness of your Lord, and turn to Him in repentance, that He may grant you good enjoyment, for a term appointed, and bestow His abounding Grace to every owner of grace (i.e. the one who helps and serves the needy and deserving, physically and with his wealth, and even with good words)”
[Hood 11:3]
The reward of repentance is blessings coming down from heaven, blessings coming from the earth, an increase in one’s wealth and offspring, blessings in productivity, good physical health and protection from diseases. Allah says of Hood (peace be upon him) (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And O my people! Ask forgiveness of your Lord and then repent to Him, He will send you (from the sky) abundant rain, and add strength to your strength, so do not turn away as Mujrimoon (criminals, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah)”
[Hood 11:52]
Thirdly: Everyone who repents to Allah, Allah accepts his repentance. The caravan of those who have repented to Allah will not be interrupted until the sun rises from the west. 
One repented from banditry, another from adultery, and others from drinking alcohol, taking drugs, severing the ties of kinship, not praying or being too lazy to pray in congregation, disobeying parents, dealing in riba (usury) and bribes, stealing, shedding blood, consuming people’s wealth unlawfully, or smoking. Anyone who repents to Allah from any sin is to be congratulated, because it is as if they have been born anew through their sincere repentance. 
It was narrated from Abu Sa’eed Sa’d ibn Maalik ibn Sinaan al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There was among the people who came before you a man who killed ninety-nine people. Then he asked about the most knowledgeable person on earth, and was directed to a hermit, so he went to him, told him that he had killed ninety-nine people, and asked if he could be forgiven. The hermit said, ‘No,’ so he killed him, thus completing one hundred. Then he asked about the most knowledgeable person on earth and was directed to a scholar. He told him that he had killed one hundred people, and asked whether he could be forgiven. The scholar said, ‘Yes, what could possibly come between you and repentance? Go to such-and-such a town, for in it there are people who worship Allah. Go and worship with them, and do not go back to your own town, for it is a bad place.” So the man set off, but when he was halfway there, the angel of death came to him, and the angels of mercy and the angels of wrath began to argue over him. The angels of mercy said: ‘He had repented and was seeking Allah.’ The angels of wrath said: ‘He never did any good thing.’ An angel in human form came to them, and they asked him to decide the matter. He said: ‘Measure the distance between the two lands (his home town and the town he was headed for), and whichever of the two he is closest to is the one to which he belongs.’ So they measured the distance, and found that he was closer to the town for which he had been headed, so the angels of mercy took him.” (Agreed upon). 
According to a version narrated by Muslim (2716): “He was closer to the righteous town by a handspan, so he was counted among its people.”
According to a version narrated by al-Bukhaari (3470): “Allah commanded (the righteous town) to draw closer and (the evil town) to move away, and he said: “Measure the distance between them,’ and he was found to be closer to (the righteous town) by a handspan, so he was forgiven.” 
According to a version narrated by Muslim: “He leaned with his chest towards it”.  
What is meant by repentance is returning to Allah, giving up sin and hating it, and regretting falling short in obedience to Allah. Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:  
Repentance is essential from every sin, even if it is something between a person and Allah and has nothing to do with the rights of another person. There are three conditions of repentance: 
1-You should give up the sin
2-You should regret having done it
3-You should resolve never to go back to it.
If one of these three is missing, then your repentance is not sincere. If the sin has to do with the rights of another person, then there are four conditions: the three mentioned above and restoring the rights of that person. If it is money or property, etc, it must be returned to him; if it had to do with slandering him etc, then you should allow him to insult you in return, or ask for his forgiveness; if it had to do with backbiting about him, then you have to ask for his pardon. It is essential to repent from all sins; if a person repents from some, his repentance from the sins from which he repented is valid – according to the scholars who follow the right path – but he must still repent from the rest as well. 
End quote. 
Based on the above, if these conditions are met by the person who is repenting, then there is the hope that his repentance will be accepted, by Allah’s leave. After that he should not worry about waswaas (whispers) suggesting that his repentance is not accepted, because that is from the Shaytaan and is contrary to what Allah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) have told us, that repentance is accepted if it is sincere.

46698,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/46698,Giving the reward for dhikr to one’s parents,"Can I say Subhaan-Allah one hundred times or some other dhikr, praying that the reward for that will be give to my father and mother? My father has died and my mother is still alive.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The scholars differed as to whether it is permissible to give reward to the dead and whether that reaches them. There are two views: 
1 – That any righteous deed may be given to the dead and that (the reward) reaches them – such as reading Quran, fasting, praying and other acts of worship. 
2 – That no righteous deed reaches the dead except those for which there is evidence that it reaches them. This is the more correct view. The evidence for that is the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And that man can have nothing but what he does”
[al-Najm 53:39]. 
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When a man dies all his good deeds come to an end except three: ongoing charity (sadaqah jaariyah), beneficial knowledge and a righteous son who will pray for him.”
Narrated by Muslim, 1631, from the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him). 
The paternal uncle of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) – Hamzah (may Allah be pleased with him) – died, as did his wife Khadeejah and three of his daughters, but it is not narrated that he read Quran for any of them, or offered a sacrifice or fasted or prayed on their behalf. No such thing has been narrated from any of the Sahaabah either. If it were prescribed, then they would have done it before us. 
The exceptions for which there is evidence that the reward does reach the deceased are: Hajj, ‘Umrah, obligatory fasts, charity and du’aa’. 
Al-Haafiz Ibn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “ ‘And that man can have nothing but what he does’: 
From this verse al-Shaafa’i and those who followed him understood that the reward for reading Quran does not reach the deceased, because it is not something that they did or earned. Hence the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not recommend or encourage his ummah to do that, and he did not tell them to do that through any statement or gesture. Nor is it narrated that any of the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) did that. If it were good they would have done that before us. So the acts of worship are restricted to those mentioned in the texts, and there is no room for analogy or personal opinions. With regard to du’aa’ and charity, there is scholarly consensus that the reward for them reaches the deceased and that they are mentioned in sharee’ah. 
Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 4/258. 
If we assume that the reward for all righteous deeds reaches the deceased, then the best thing that can benefit the deceased is du’aa’. So why should we ignore that which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has encouraged us to do, and turn to other things that he did not do and that none of his companions did? All goodness is to be found in the guidance of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his companions. 
Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked about giving the reward for reading Quran and charity to one's mother, whether she is alive or dead. 
He replied: 
With regard to reading Quran, the scholars differed as to whether the reward for that will reach the deceased. There are two scholarly views, the more correct of which is that it does not reach the deceased because there is no evidence to that effect. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not do that for his deceased Muslim loved ones such as his daughters who died during his lifetime, and the Sahaabah (may Allah be pleased with them) did not do that or approve of it, as far as we know. It is better for the believer not to do that and not to read Quran for the dead or the living, or to pray on their behalf, or to observe voluntary fasts on their behalf, because there is no evidence for any of that. The basic principle concerning acts of worship is that we do not do anything except that which is proven to be prescribed by Allah or His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). 
Charity benefits both the living and the dead, according to Muslim consensus. Similarly du’aa’ benefits both the living and the dead according to Muslim consensus. Undoubtedly the living benefit from charity given by them and by others, and they benefit from du’aa’. If a person makes du’aa’ for his parents when they are alive, they benefit from his du’aa’, as they also benefit from charity given on their behalf when they are still alive, and from Hajj done on their behalf if they are unable to do it themselves because of old age or incurable sickness. So a person may benefit them by doing that. Hence it is narrated that a woman said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “O Messenger of Allah, Allah’s command to perform Hajj has come when my father is an old man and cannot sit firmly in the saddle. Shall I perform Hajj on his behalf?” He said: “Perform Hajj on his behalf.” Another man came to him and said: “O Messenger of Allah, my father is an old man and cannot perform Hajj or travel; shall I perform Hajj and ‘Umrah on his behalf?” He said: “Perform Hajj and ‘Umrah on behalf of your father.” This indicates that it is permissible to perform Hajj on behalf of one who has died or on behalf of a living man or woman who is unable to do it because of old age. So giving charity, making du’aa’ and performing Hajj on behalf of one who has died or one who is unable to do it will benefit him, according to all the scholars. Similarly one may fast on behalf of a deceased person, if he owed an obligatory fast – whether as the result of a vow, as an expiation or to make up for a Ramadaan fast – because of the general meaning of the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Whoever dies owing a fast, his heir must observe the fast on his behalf.” Saheeh – agreed upon. And there are other ahaadeeth which say the same thing. But whoever delays Ramadaan fasts for a legitimate reason, such as sickness or travel, then dies before he is able to make them up, there is no need to fast them on his behalf or feed the poor, because he is excused. 
Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat al-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 4/348. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: Is it permissible for a man to give money in charity and to share the reward for it with someone else? He replied: It is permissible for a person to give money in charity and intend for it to be on behalf of his father, his mother or his brother or anyone else he wants among the Muslims, because the reward is great. If charity is given sincerely for the sake of Allah and from wealth that is acquired in a halaal manner, then the reward will be multiplied greatly, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“The likeness of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah, is as the likeness of a grain (of corn); it grows seven ears, and each ear has a hundred grains. Allah gives manifold increase to whom He wills. And Allah is All-Sufficient for His creatures’ needs, All-Knower”
[al-Baqarah 2:261]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to slaughter a single sheep on behalf of himself and the members of his household. 
Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 18/249 
From the above it is clear that what you have mentioned about giving the reward of dhikr to your parents is not correct according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions, whether they are alive or deceased. Rather what we advise you to do is to make a great deal of du’aa’ for them and give charity on their behalf, for all goodness is in following the guidance of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his noble companions.
