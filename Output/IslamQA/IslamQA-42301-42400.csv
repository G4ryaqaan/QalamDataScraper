42314,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/42314,Is the farewell tawaaf obligatory for the people of Jeddah?,"We live in Jeddah and we wanted to do Hajj. We went for Hajj, but we did not do the farewell tawaaf because my father refused and said to us that no one needs to do this tawaaf except those who are travelling. What should we do?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked: 

    I live in the city of Jeddah and I always go to Makkah. 
    Should I bid farewell to the Sacred House after Hajj, or should I delay that 
    until I am going to travel to my own country? Is there any expiation to be 
    offered for delaying the farewell tawaaf? 

    They replied: 
If you do Hajj then do 
    not leave for Jeddah after your Hajj until you have performed the farewell 
    tawaaf. If you left before performing the farewell tawaaf, then you have to 
    offer a sacrifice to be slaughtered in the Haram; and you should not eat any 
    of it, rather it should be given to the poor, because the farewell tawaaf is 
    obligatory after Hajj, because of the general meaning of the hadeeth of Ibn 
    ‘Abbaas (may Allaah have mercy on him): “The people were commanded that the 
    last thing they do should do is to circumambulate the House, but an 
    exception was made for menstruating women.” (Saheeh – agreed upon). So you 
    have to repent to Allaah for going out to Jeddah before performing the 
    farewell tawaaf.  

    Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz, Shaykh ‘Abd al-Razzaaq 
    ‘Afeefi, Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Ghadyaan. Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah 
    li’l-Buhooth al-‘Ilmiyyah wa’l-Ifta’ (11/303). 

    Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    was asked: 

    Is it permissible for a pilgrim to travel to Jeddah without 
    performing the farewell tawaaf? What should the one who has done that do? 

    He replied: 

    It is not permissible for a pilgrim to leave Makkah after 
    Hajj until he has done the farewell tawaaf, because the Prophet  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No one among you should leave 
    until the last thing he has done is to circumambulate the House.” Narrated 
    by Muslim. And in al-Saheehayn it is narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may 
    Allaah be pleased with him) said: “The people were commanded that the last 
    thing they do should be to circumambulate the House, but an exception was 
    made for menstruating women.” So it is not permissible for the people of 
    Jeddah or al-Taa’if or anywhere else to leave Makkah after Hajj without 
    performing the farewell tawaaf. 
Whoever travels before 
    doing the farewell tawaaf has to offer a compensatory sacrifice for having 
    omitted an obligatory action. And there are other views concerning that, but 
    this is the correct view on this matter according to the scholars. Some of 
    the scholars said that if he goes back with the intention of performing the 
    farewell tawaaf, that is sufficient and he does not have to offer the 
    sacrifice, but this is subject to further discussion. In order to be on the 
    safe side, if a believer travels a distance that allows him to shorten his 
    prayers without performing the farewell tawaaf, he should offer a sacrifice 
    to make up for this defect in his Hajj.

    If he cannot slaughter a sheep because he cannot afford it, 
    then he does not have to do anything and he does not have to fast. 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, 
    after a detailed discussion on the ruling on one who omits an obligatory 
    action: 
In that case we say to 
    one who has omitted an obligatory action: Offer a sacrifice in Makkah and 
    distribute it (its meat) to the poor; either do this yourself or appoint a 
    person whom you trust to do it for you. If you are unable to do that, then 
    your repentance is sufficient and you do not need to fast. This is what we 
    think concerning this matter.

1 – It is not permissible to abort a pregnancy at any stage unless there is a legitimate reason, and within very precise limits.  
2 – If the pregnancy is in the first stage, which is a period of forty days, and aborting it serves a legitimate purpose or will ward off harm, then it is permissible to abort it. But aborting it at this stage for fear of the difficulty of raising children or of being unable to bear the costs of maintaining and educating them, or for fear for their future or because the couple feel that they have enough children – this is not permissible. 
3 – It is not permissible to abort a pregnancy when it is an ‘alaqah (clot) or mudghah (chewed lump of flesh) (which are the second and third periods of forty days each) until a trustworthy medical committee has decided that continuing the pregnancy poses a threat to the mother’s wellbeing, in that there is the fear that she will die if the pregnancy continues. It is permissible to abort it once all means of warding off that danger have been exhausted. 
4 – After the third stage, and after four months have passed, it is not permissible to abort the pregnancy unless a group of trustworthy medical specialists decide that keeping the foetus in his mother’s womb will cause her death, and that should only be done after all means of keeping the foetus alive have been exhausted. A concession is made allowing abortion in this case so as to ward off the greater of two evils and to serve the greater of two interests.","Al-Fatawa al-Jaami’ah, 3/1056"

Does she have to offer expiation, or is forgetting regarded as an excuse?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Your wife is to be thanked for her honesty and her keenness not to disclose 
    secrets. With regard to her disclosing the secret because she forgot, no kafaarah is required in this case, because in order for kafaarah to be 
    obligatory, three conditions must be met: 
1 – The oath should have been sworn concerning a matter in the future.
2 – The person who swore the oath should have done so voluntarily and not have 
    been forced to do so.
3 – The vow or oath should have been broken, by the person doing that which he 
    swore not to do, by choice and remembering his oath. But if he broke his oath because he was forced to, or he forgot or out of ignorance, then no 
    kafaarah is due. 
The evidence for that is the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 
“Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error”
[al-Baqarah 2:286]
And Allaah has said, “I have done that” [i.e., forgiven them].

42373,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/42373,Does a brownish discharge have any effect on Hajj and ‘Umrah?,"I was two month pregnant and I miscarried two days before I went for Hajj. I was taahir (pure) except that on the day of al-Tarwiyah, that night I saw a few dark spots that were like the spotting in the last days of the monthly period, i.e., they were not blood but were a dirty brown. But I completed my Hajj. Is my Hajj valid?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The spots that you saw do not affect your Hajj or ‘Umrah, because they are not menstrual blood or postpartum bleeding (nifaas), rather they were spots that are called al-kadrah (brownish discharge). The ruling on these spots is that wudoo’ is required according to the majority of scholars. If you did wudoo’ when you did tawaaf al-ifaadah, then your tawaaf is valid according to the majority of scholars. If you did not do wudoo’ then there is a difference of scholarly opinion: is tawaaf valid if a person has not purified himself, or not? 
This has been discussed in the answer to question no. 34695. The view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen is that it is not essential. 
Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
What comes after purification (from menses) such as brownish or yellowish discharge, or spotting, or wetness, is not menses, so it does not mean that a woman is not allowed to pray or fast, or that a man is not allowed to have intercourse with his wife, because it is not menses.
Umm ‘Atiyyah said: “We did not regard the yellowish or brownish discharge as being anything significant.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari. Abu Dawood added: “after becoming pure.” Its isnaad is saheeh. Based on this, we say: Everything that happened after being sure that the period was over does not affect a woman or mean that she is not allowed to pray or fast or that her husband is not allowed to be intimate with her. But she should not rush until she sees the tuhr (white discharge indicating the end of menses), because some women, when the bleeding lessens, hasten to do ghusl before they see the tuhr. Hence the women of the Sahaabah used to send pieces of cotton on which there was blood to ‘Aa’ishah, and she would say to them, “Do not rush until you see the white discharge.” End quote.

Conclusion: Your Hajj is valid in sha Allah, and these spots are not menses or nifaas.

But one of the shaykhs gave us a fatwa stating that this will not benefit him because it is not from his wealth, and ongoing charity has to be set up by the person himself during his own lifetime before his death, and has to continue after his death. Is what the Shaykh said correct? 

If it is not correct, then please advise me and tell me the best way to benefit my deceased father.

Sadaqah Jariyah for the Deceased


How to benefit your dead father","Praise be to Allah.What benefits the dead?
The scholars are agreed that the benefits of du`a , praying for forgiveness, giving charity and Hajj reach the deceased. 
With regard to du`a and praying for forgiveness, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And those who came after them say: ‘Our Lord! Forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us in Faith’” [al-Hashr 59:10]
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Pray for forgiveness for your brother and ask that he be made steadfast, for now he is being questioned.” 
And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When you offer the (funeral) prayer for the deceased, then make du`a sincerely for him.”  
With regard to charity, it was narrated in al-Sahihayn from `Aishah that a man said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “My mother died suddenly and she did not leave a will, but I think that if she could have spoken she would have given in charity. Will she have a reward if I give in charity on her behalf?” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Yes.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, no. 1388; Muslim, no. 1004)  
And it was narrated by al-Bukhari from Sa’d ibn 'Ubadah that his mother died when he was absent, and he said: “O Messenger of Allah, my mother has died when I was absent. Will it benefit her if I give in charity on her behalf?” He said: “Yes.” He said: “I ask you to bear witness that my garden that bears fruit is given in charity on her behalf.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2756) 
With regard to Hajj , the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to one who asked him about Hajj: “Don’t you think that if your mother had a debt, you would pay it off for her?” She said: “Yes.” He said:  “A debt owed to Allah is more deserving of being paid off.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 6699; Muslim, 1148) 
Sadaqah Jariyah for the Deceased
From the above you will know that giving charity on behalf of the deceased will benefit him and its reward will reach him. 
There is a weak hadith about offering prayer on behalf of the dead. Imam Muslim mentioned in his introduction to his Sahih that ‘Abd-Allah ibn al-Mubarak regarded this hadith as weak, then he said: 
“There is no difference of opinion concerning giving charity (i.e., on behalf of the dead).”
Al-Nawawi said: 
“His words “There is no difference of opinion concerning giving charity (i.e., on behalf of the dead)” means that this hadith is not to be taken as evidence. But whoever wants to honour his parents, let him give charity on their behalf, for (the reward of) charity will reach the deceased and benefit them, and there is no difference of opinion among the Muslims concerning this point. This is the correct view. 
With regard to the report narrated by the judge Abu’l-Hasan al-Mawardi al-Basri al-Faqih al-Shaf’i in his book al-Hawi from some of the scholars of al-kalam, that no reward can reach the deceased after his death, this is a view that is definitely wrong and is clearly contrary to the texts of the Quran and Sunnah and the consensus of the ummah, so no attention should be paid to it. With regard to praying and fasting on behalf of the dead, the view of al-Shafi’i and the majority of the scholars is that the reward for that does not reach the deceased, unless it is a fast that was obligatory for the deceased, so his heir or someone to whom the heir gives permission makes it up on his behalf. Two views concerning this were narrated from al-Shafi’i, the better known of which is that it is not valid; the more correct view according to the later Shafi'i scholars is that it is valid. 
With regard to reading the Quran, the well-known view of the Shafi'i madhhab is that the reward for that does not reach the deceased. Some of his companions said that its reward does reach the deceased. Some of the scholars were of the view that the reward of all acts of worship – prayer, fasting, reading Quran, etc – reaches the deceased… Then al-Nawawi mentioned that the reward for du`a, charity and Hajj reaches the deceased, according to scholarly consensus.” 
It says in Tuhfat al-Muhtaj (7/72): 
“The deceased can benefit from charity given on his behalf, which includes a waqf of a Mus-haf etc, or digging a well, or planting a tree, whether he does that during his lifetime or it is done by someone else on his behalf after his death. 
How to benefit your dead father
With regard to the best ways of benefiting your father, you should make a lot of du`a for him. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and say: ‘My Lord! Bestow on them Your Mercy as they did bring me up when I was young’” [al-Isra 17:24]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When a person dies, all his good deeds come to an end except three: ongoing charity , or beneficial knowledge, or a righteous child who will pray for him.”  
With regard to charity , the best things on which charity may be spent are jihad for the sake of Allah, building mosques, and helping seekers of knowledge by printing books for them or giving them money that they need.
