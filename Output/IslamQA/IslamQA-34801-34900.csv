What I mean by something extra is adding some charity so as to be on the safe side and make sure that my saa’ is sufficient, without telling the poor person to whom I give it that this is charity. For example, I have ten persons in my family, so I buy a bag of rice weighing fifty kilograms, then I give it all as zakaat al-fitr on behalf of these ten persons, without counting out the saa’s for them, because I know that this is twenty or more kilos extra, intending the extra to be charity, then I do not tell him that this extra is charity, rather I say, “Take our zakaah,” so he does not know that this bag contains more than the zakaah, so he takes it and is happy with it. What is the ruling on that?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Zakaat al-Fitr is one saa’ of wheat or dates 
    or rice etc., the local staple food, for one person, male ofrfemale, old or young. There is nothing wrong with giving more as zakaat al-fitr as 
    you have done, with the intention of giving charity, even if you do not tell the poor person about it.

If you build on it and make money from it, then you will have to pay zakaah on the 
    money that you get from it, if it reaches the minimum threshold (nisaab) and one full hijri year has passed.

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was asked: is any zakaah due on land that has been prepared for dwellings in the future? 
He replied: 
There is no zakaah due on it if it has been prepared for dwellings or for any 
    other use, until one full hijri year has passed since any income was derived from it.  
And he also said: 
Land which you have bought to live on or to rent out is not subject to zakaah even 
    if you keep it for a number of years, because the land on which zakaah is due is that which a person prepares to sell in order to make money. But 
    as for that which a person prepares for his own needs or to make use of it, there is no zakaah due on it, as is the case with all trade goods. 
    Based on this you do not have to pay any zakaah for this land. And Allaah is the Source of strength.

How to deal with financial losses in Islam


Attitude of Muslims towards calamities","Praise be to Allah.Islamic Guidelines for Permissible Investment

The Muslim should strive to invest his money in permissible ways , not in forbidden ways, and he should avoid anything that gives rise to doubt.
He should choose someone who is strong, trustworthy, able to manage the money, cause it to grow and invest it, and one who has experience in all fields of investment
The contract of silent partnership (Mudarabah ) or investment should be valid according to Shari`ah, free from invalid or prohibited conditions. It is not permissible to enter into a contract which guarantees to protect the capital or guarantees a specific amount of profit; the share of each partner should be stated, etc.
The investor should fear Allah with regard to his handling of people’s money. He should not take that which he is unable to handle, or accept money from anyone that he knows he will not be able to invest properly. He has to abide by the conditions of the Mudarabah . If the owner of the money stipulates that the money is to be invested in a specific country, it is not permitted to go beyond that. If he stipulated that it is to be invested in a specific field, it is not permitted to transgress that. It is not permissible to trick people and make them think that he is making money when he is not. It is a major sin to give the capital of new investors as profits to old investors when one is not doing any real trade which would cause the money to grow. It is not permissible to deceive people by claiming high profits when he knows for certain that he does not have any business that could bring this type of profit.
He has to fear Allah with regard to people’s wealth and provide a team of financial and administrative experts who are able to develop this wealth that people have entrusted to him.

How to deal with financial losses in Islam
In the event of loss:

The one who is managing the investment must be honest and truthful in telling the people what really happened.
If there has been any carelessness of negligence on his part, then he must replace what was lost through his negligence, and he himself must bear the loss that resulted from his carelessness.
The owner of the capital must, in the case of loss, accept the will and decree of Allah and strive to reduce the loss and deal with its effects, and save whatever he can of his capital by all permissible means.
Accepting the will and decree of Allah will help the one who has lost his money to avoid a nervous breakdown and feelings of distress, so he will not go insane or collapse or commit suicide as happens to some of those who are not patient. He has to remember the following facts:

Attitude of Muslims towards calamities
The calamities that may befall a man , his wealth, his family or his society are not so bad that they justify panic; rather they are good for the believer if he deals with them well.

They are good for him as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “How wonderful is the affair of the believer, for all his affairs are good, and that is not for anyone except the believer. If something good happens to him, he gives thanks for it and that is good for him. If something bad happens to him, he bears it with patience and that is good for him.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2999)
It may be that Allah wills good for him thereby. Al-Bukhaari (5645) narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When Allah wills good for a person, He puts him through trials .”

Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Abu ‘Ubayd Al-Harawi said: This means that He tests him with calamities so that He may reward him.

It may mean that Allah loves him. “When Allah loves people He tests them: whoever is patient will be given the reward for patience and whoever panics will gain nothing but panic.” Its narrators are trustworthy.

It was narrated from Sakhbarah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever is given something and gives thanks, or is tested and is patient, or does wrong and seeks forgiveness, or is wronged and forgives, for them (only) there is security and they are the guided [cf. Al-An’am 6:82].” (Narrated by At-Tabarani with a sound Isnad (chain of narration))

Allah has explained in His Book the way to soothe the heart and calm a troubled mind: that is by means of patience and Istirja` (saying Inna Lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji`un), which are mentioned along with a great reward from Allah, a reward by means of which Allah will raise the status of the one who is patient and seeks His reward. This is a promise from Allah which He will fulfil, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):

“And certainly, We shall test you with something of fear, hunger, loss of wealth, lives and fruits, but give glad tidings to As- Sabirun (the patient).
Who, when afflicted with calamity, say: ‘Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return [Inna Lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji`un].’
They are those on whom are the Salawat (i.e. who are blessed and will be forgiven) from their Lord, and (they are those who) receive His Mercy, and it is they who are the guided ones.” [Al-Baqarah 2:155-157]
Al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
“Allah has made the words of the Istirja`, which means saying Inna Lillaahi wa inna ilayhi raaji’oon (‘Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return’) a refuge for those who are afflicted by calamities, and a protection against the devil for those who are tested, lest he gain control over them and whisper evil thoughts to them. Because if the devil whispers bad ideas, he keeps stirring up negative feelings. But when the believer resorts to these words, which encompass meanings of goodness and blessing, then the words “inna Lillahi (to Allah we belong)” are an affirmation of complete submission to Allah and an affirmation of Allah’s control of all things, just as a king deals with his kingdom however he wants. The words “wa inna ilayhi raji`un (and truly to Him we shall return)” are an affirmation of the fact that Allah will cause us to die, then He will resurrect us. It also expresses hope of reward from Allah.
One of the immediate blessings of this Istirja`, in addition to what we have mentioned above, is that which was narrated by Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her), who said, “I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: ‘There is no Muslim who is stricken with a calamity , and he says that which Allah has commanded him to say, Inna Lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji`un, Allahumma ajurni fi musibati wa akhluf li khayran minha (Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return. O Allah, reward me for my calamity and compensate me with something better than it), but Allah will compensate me with something better than it.’”

It is an expiation for his sins, because Al-Bukhari and Muslim narrated that `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no calamity that befalls a Muslim but Allah expiates sin thereby, even a thorn that pricks him.”
What is required is steadfastness and patience from the first moment one hears bad news or hears of the investment company’s losses, for example. This will guard against heart attacks or nervous breakdowns, in addition to the fact that the patience for which a person will be rewarded is patience in the face of the initial shock. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Patience is at the first shock.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1238 and Muslim, 926)

An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: What this means is complete patience which brings a great reward because it is so difficult.

If a person handles calamity well, it will become a blessing for him, because Allah will expiate sins thereby and raise him in status.

Allah may grant blessing by means of calamity, even if it is great, and He may test some people by means of blessings.

The Muslim must believe with certainty that the loss of his money is not a sign that Allah despises him. Allah has told us that richness and poverty are means of tests and trials. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):

“As for man, when his Lord tries him by giving him honour and bounties, then he says (in exultation): ‘My Lord has honoured me.’ But when He tries him by straitening his means of life, he says: ‘My Lord has humiliated me!’” [Al-Fajr 89:15-16]

When calamity strikes, the Muslim must follow the example of those who came before us, righteous slaves of Allah who suffered calamity. Allah says, describing how He relieved Ayyub (peace be upon him) of his suffering, “as a mercy from Ourselves” [Al-Anbiya’ 21:84 - interpretation of the meaning], i.e., We relieved him of his distress as a mercy from Us to him, and as an act of kindness; “and a Reminder for all who worship Us” [ibid] means, as a reminder to those who are tested with regard to physical health, wealth or children, that they have an example in the Prophet of Allah Ayyub (peace be upon him), whom Allah tested with far greater calamities, but he bore it with patience and sought Allah’s reward, until Allah relieved him of that.

There came to the caliph Al-Walid ibn `Abd Al-Malik an old man from `Abs who was blind. When he sat with him one evening, Al-Walid asked him how he was, and he said, “O Amir Al-Mu’minin, there was a time when there was no man in `Abs who had more money, horses, camels or children, or who was stronger in respect of men [cf. Al-Kahf 18:34], or higher in status.
There came to us a flood that took away our families, children and wealth, and there was no one left but a newborn boy and a camel calf. I fought my way to the boy and picked him up, then I tried to catch up with the camel which was running away, and when I could not catch the camel, I put the boy on the ground and chased the camel. I heard the boy screaming, and when I came back I found that the wolf had eaten him. I chased the camel and when I caught it, it kicked me in the face and blinded me, and threw me on my back. When I came to, I thought to myself, just last night I was a man of great wealth, with money, wives, children and a high status among the tribes; now I am empty-handed and unable to see, with no children, no wives, and no wealth – and I praised Allah for that.” Al-Walid said: “Take him to `Urwah ibn Az-Zubayr, and so that he may realise that there is someone in this world who has been tested more severely than him, and has been more patient and steadfast.”
How many trials have turned out to be a blessing. It may be better for a person to be poor and sick, because if he had been healthy and rich he may have committed much evil. “And if Allah were to enlarge the provision for His slaves, they would surely rebel in the earth” [Ash-Shura 42:27 – interpretation of the meaning].

The collapse of an investment company does not mean that he will not get any of his money back. He may get half of it, or more or less. Even if he loses all his money, that is not the end of the world, and he need not give up hope. Allah may bless him with other wealth in the future, and compensate him if he is patient.


Everyone who has given out false information, or made people think something that was not true, or used trickery and deceit, or taken money from people to invest in a specific area, then deceived them by putting it with failing investment companies and splitting the profits between himself and them, has to repent to Allah.

Similarly, whoever takes risks with people’s money, or the savings of his sister, mother or wife, and does not tell them what he is really going to do with it, or whoever takes out an interest-based loan in order to join these investment companies, also has to repent. Perhaps finding out the truth will be a great lesson from which he must learn.

Those who previously advised people not to take such risks, should realise that it is not appropriate to rejoice in the misfortunes of others in such cases. They must strive to reduce the calamity by all means, and relieve the distress, and offer all kinds of support to those who have been affected.
The religion of Islam and its sincere followers have nothing whatsoever to do with the consequences of any kind of such lies, deceit, trickery, betrayal, misconduct or reckless investment. Rather the negligent should bear the blame and should not blame others for his recklessness, misconduct and deceit.

Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“That no burdened person (with sins) shall bear the burden (sins) of another.” [An-Najm 53:38]
“And whenever you give your word (i.e. judge between men or give evidence), say the truth.” [Al-An`am 6:152]
“Be just: that is nearer to piety.” [Al-Ma’idah 5:8]
“Stand out firmly for justice.” [An-Nisa’ 4:135]

It is essential to follow the means prescribed in Shari`ah in the event of loss. So the remaining money should be shared out among the owners of the capital, giving each of them a share of the remaining money based on the original percentage of capital he invested.

It is not permissible to sell unpaid debts and money for a smaller amount of money, because that is combining Riba Al-fadl and Riba An-nasi’ah, and riba is one of the most serious of major sins.

The Muslims should strive to support one another. There is no room for slander, curses, divorcing one’s wife, disobeying one’s parents, severing ties of kinship or attacking others.

Those Muslims who are able to do so should help the owners of capital among the poor, weak, orphans, widows and disabled, and those who have limited incomes or who have sold their houses and cars or stopped their businesses in order to invest in this losing venture. They should also save whatever can be saved of charitable donations which were wrongfully invested in these ventures without the permission of the donors, because there is no one to pursue the matter and salvage whatever can be saved of these charitable donations.
Muslim lawyers should strive to help the weak to gain their rights and seek reward with Allah for saving charitable donations, proving the innocence of the innocent and offering consultation and sincere advice for the sake of Islam.
We ask Allah to compensate those who have been stricken with calamity with something better and to grant them patience in dealing with that which has befallen them, for He is the best of providers.

And how does Allah descend in different countries?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.There are mutawaatir ahadith from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) which prove that Allah descends. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Our Lord descends to the lowest heaven every night when the last third of the night remains, and He says, ‘Who will call upon Me, that I may answer him? Who will ask of Me, that I may give him? Who will ask Me for forgiveness, that I may forgive him?’” 
Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah are unanimously agreed that Allah descends in a manner that befits Him, and that He is not like His creation at all in any of His attributes, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say (O Muhammad): He is Allah, (the) One.
Allah‑us‑Samad [Allah — the Self‑Sufficient Master, Whom all creatures need, (He neither eats nor drinks)].
He begets not, nor was He begotten.
And there is none co‑equal or comparable unto Him”
[al-Ikhlaas 112:1-4]
“There is nothing like Him, and He is the All‑Hearer, the All‑Seer”
[al-Shoora 42:11]
According to Ahl al-Sunnah wa'l-Jamaa'ah, we must accept the verses and ahadith that speak of the attributes of Allah as they are, without distorting them, denying any of His attributes, trying to imagine how they are or trying to liken Him to any of His creation; at the same time we must believe in them and believe that what is said in these texts is true, without likening Allah to His creation or discussing the nature of His attributes. Rather their view concerning His attributes is like their view concerning His essence: Ahl al-Sunnah wa'l-Jamaa'ah affirm the Essence of Allah without discussing how it is, or likening Him to any of His creation, and thus we must also affirm His attributes without discussing how they are, or likening these attributes to the attributes of any of His creation. The descent of Allah happens in every country in a manner that befits Allah, because the descent of Allah cannot be likened to the descent of any of His creation. He is described as descending in the last part of the night in all parts of the world in a manner that befits His Majesty, may He be exalted. No one can know how He descends just as no one can know how His Essence is, except Him. 
“There is nothing like Him, and He is the All‑Hearer, the All‑Seer”
[al-Shoora 42:11 – interpretation of the meaning] 
“So put not forward similitudes for Allah (as there is nothing similar to Him, nor He resembles anything). Truly, Allah knows and you know not”
[al-Nahl 16:74 – interpretation of the meaning]
The first and last third of the night differ according to the season. If the night is nine hours long then the time of descent begins at the onset of the seventh hour, until dawn comes. If the night is twelve hours long then the last third begins at the beginning of the ninth hour until dawn comes, and so on, depending on how long or short the night is in each place. And Allah is the Source of strength.","Majmoo’ Fataawa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi’ah by Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him), vol. 4, p. 420"
34815,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34815,Menstruating women entering rooms attached to the mosque,"We have a mosque that is composed of three storeys. The highest storey is the musalla (prayer room) for the women, the storey beneath contains the original musalla, and the storey beneath that (the basement) contains washrooms, a place for Islamic magazines and books, and classrooms for the women, and an additional place for women to pray. Is it permissible for menstruating women to enter this lower level?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.This depends on the intentions of the one who set up the waqf for the mosque. If he intended that the lower level should be part of the mosque, then it comes under the same ruling as a mosque, so it is not permissible for menstruating women to enter it. 
If his intention was that it should not be part of the mosque and that it should rather contain washrooms etc., then this level is not considered to be part of the mosque and does not come under the same ruling as the mosque, so it is permissible for menstruating women to enter it and sit in it. 
Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
If the building mentioned is regarded as a mosque and the people in the upper and lower levels can hear the voice of the imam, the prayer of all of them is valid, and it is not permissible for a menstruating woman to sit in the place that is prepared for prayer on the lower level, because it is part of the mosque. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I do not allow the mosque for any menstruating women or anyone who is junub (in a state of impurity following sexual activity).” 
With regard to a menstruating woman passing through the mosque for some need, whilst being careful to make sure no drops of blood fall on the floor, there is nothing wrong with that, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“nor when you are in a state of Janaaba (i.e. in a state of sexual impurity and have not yet taken a bath), except when travelling on the road (without enough water, or just passing through a mosque), till you wash your whole body” [al-Nisa’ 4:43]
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded ‘Aa’ishah to pass him a rug from the mosque, and she said that she was menstruating. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Your menstruation is not in your hand.” 
But if the lower level was not built by the one who set up the waqf for the mosque, and was intended as a storage area or a place for the things mentioned in the question, then it does not come under the rulings on mosques, so it is permissible for menstruating women and people who are junub to sit there, and it is o.k. to pray there in a clean place where there are no toilets, as is the case with any other clean place where there is nothing to prevent people from praying there. But whoever prays there cannot follow the imam who is praying above him because he cannot see him or see some of the people praying behind him, and because it is not part of the mosque according to the more sound of the two scholarly opinions.

Difference between major and minor shirk in terms of ruling","Praise be to Allah.What is shirk?
One of the most important obligations is to know the meaning of shirk, its seriousness and its different types, so that our Tawheed (belief in the Oneness of Allah) and our Islam may be complete, and our faith may be sound. We say – And Allah is the Source of strength and true guidance comes from Him: 
Lexical meaning of shirk
Know – may Allah guide you – that the word shirk in Arabic means taking a partner, i.e., regarding someone as the partner of another. It is said [in Arabic]: ashraka baynahuma (he joined them together) when he regarded them as two of equal status; or ashraka fi amrihi ghayrahu (he introduced another into his affair) when he made two people involved in it.
Meaning of shirk in Shari`ah teminology 
In terms of shari’ah or Islamic terminology, shirk means ascribing a partner or rival to Allah in Lordship (rububiyyah), worship or in His names and attributes. 
A rival is a peer or counterpart. Hence Allah forbids setting up rivals with Him and He condemns those who take them (rivals) as gods instead of or besides Allah in many verses of the Quran. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Then do not set up rivals unto Allah (in worship) while you know (that He Alone has the right to be worshipped)” [al-Baqarah 2:22] 
“And they set up rivals to Allah, to mislead (men) from His path! Say: ‘Enjoy (your brief life)! But certainly, your destination is the (Hell) Fire!’” [Ibrahim 14:30] 
In the hadith, it is narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever dies claiming that Allah has a rival, will enter Hell.” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 4497; Muslim, 92. 
Types of shirk
The texts of the Quran and Sunnah indicate that shirk and the ascribing of rivals to Allah sometimes puts a person beyond the pale of Islam and sometimes does not. Hence the scholars divided shirk into two types which they call shirk akbar (major shirk) and shirk asghar (minor shirk). There follows a brief description of each type: 
Major shirk 
This means ascribing to someone other than Allah something that belongs only to Allah, such as Lordship (rububiyyah), divinity (uluhiyyah) and the divine names and attributes (al-asma’ wa’l-sifat). 
This kind of shirk may sometimes be outward, such as the shirk of those who worship idols and graves, or the dead or absent. 
Or it may sometimes be hidden, such as those who put their trust in other gods besides Allah, or the shirk and kufr of the hypocrites. For even though  their (hypocrites’) shirk puts them beyond the pale of Islam and means that they will abide  forever in Hell, it is a hidden shirk, because they make an outward display of Islam and conceal their kufr and shirk, so they are inwardly mushriks but not outwardly. 
Types of major shirk 
Shirk may sometimes take the form of beliefs 
Such as the belief that there is someone else who creates, gives life and death, reigns or controls the affairs of the universe along with Allah. 
Or the belief that there is someone else who must be obeyed absolutely besides Allah, so they follow him in regarding as permissible or forbidden whatever he wants, even if that goes against the religion of the Messengers. 
Or they may associate others with Allah in love and veneration, by loving a created being as they love Allah. This is the kind of shirk that Allah does not forgive, and it is the shirk of which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And of mankind are some who take (for worship) others besides Allah as rivals(to Allah). They love them as they love Allah” [al-Baqarah 2:165] 
Or the belief that there are those who know the Unseen as well as Allah. This is very common among some of the deviant sects such as the Rafidis (Shi’ah), extreme Sufis, and Batinis (esoteric sects) in general. The Rafidis believe that their imams have knowledge of the unseen, and the Batinis and Sufis believe similar things about their awliya (“saints”), and so on. It is also shirk to believe that there is someone who bestows mercy in a manner that is befitting only for Allah, so he shows mercy as Allah does and forgives sins and overlooks the bad deeds of his worshippers.  
Shirk may sometimes take the form of words
Such as those who make du’a or pray to someone other than Allah, or seek his help or seek refuge with him with regard to matters over which no one has control except Allah, whether the person called upon is a prophet, a wali (“saint”), an angel or a jinn, or some other created being. This is a kind of major shirk which puts one beyond the pale of Islam. 
Or such as those who make fun of religion or who liken Allah to His creation, or say that there is another creator, provider or controller besides Allah. All of these are major shirk and a grave sin that is not forgiven. 
Shirk may sometimes take the form of actions 
Such as one who sacrifices, prays or prostrates to something other than Allah, or who promulgates laws to replace the rulings of Allah and makes that the law to which people are obliged to refer for judgement; or one who supports the kafirs and helps them against the believers, and other acts that go against the basic meaning of faith and put the one who does them beyond the pale of Islam. We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound. 
Minor shirk 
This includes everything that may lead to major shirk, or which is described in the texts as being shirk, but does not reach the extent of being major shirk. 
This is usually of two types: 
1 – Being emotionally attached to some means which have no basis and  for which Allah has not given permission, such as hanging up “hands”, turquoise beads etc on the grounds that they offer protection or that they ward off the evil eye. But Allah has not made them the means of such protection, either according to shari’ah or according to the laws of the universe.
[Translator’s note: the “hands” referred to are objects made of metal, pottery etc, usually blue or turquoise in colour, that some people hang up to ward off the evil eye, according to their mistaken belief] 
2 – Venerating some people or things in a way that does not go so far as ascribing lordship to them, such as swearing by something other than Allah, or saying, “Were it not for Allah and So and So,” etc. 
Guidelines to distinguish major shirk from minor shirk
The scholars have stipulated guidelines to distinguish major shirk from minor shirk when shirk is mentioned in the texts of shari’ah. These guidelines include the following: 
1 – When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) states clearly that this action is minor shirk, such as in al-Musnad (27742) where it is narrated that Mahmud ibn Labid said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The thing that I fear most for you is minor shirk.” They said: “O Messenger of Allah, what is minor shirk?” He said: “Showing off, for Allah will say on the Day when people are recompensed for their actions: ‘Go to those for whom you were showing off with your deeds in the world, and see what reward you find with them.’” (Classed as sahih by al-Albani in al-Silsilah al-Sahihah, 951) 
2 – When the word shirk is used in the texts of the Quran and Sunnah in the indefinite form [without the definite article al-]. This usually refers to minor shirk, and there are many examples of this, such as when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Incantations, amulets and love spells are shirk.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 3883; classed as sahih by al-Albani in al-Silsilah al-Sahihah, 331) 
What is meant by shirk here is minor shirk, not major shirk. 
Amulets are things that are hung on children such as turquoise beads and the like, which they claim will protect them from the evil eye. 
Love spells are something that they do, claiming that it will make a woman beloved to her husband and a man beloved to his wife. 
3 – If the Sahabah understood from the texts of Shari’ah that what was meant by shirk here was minor shirk, not major. Undoubtedly the understanding of the Sahabah carries weight, because they are the most knowledgeable of the people concerning the religion of Allah, and the most knowledgeable as to the intent of the Lawgiver. 
For example, Abu Dawud (3910) narrated from Ibn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Tiyarah (superstitious belief in omens) is shirk, tiyarah is shirk,” three times, and there is no one among us but (will have some of that) but Allah will rid him of it by means of tawakkul (putting his trust in Allah). The words “there is no one among us…” are the words of Ibn Mas’ud, as was explained by the prominent scholars of hadith. This indicates that Ibn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him) understood that this was minor shirk, because he could not have said, “There is no one among us…” referring to major shirk. Moreover, major shirk cannot be eliminated by means of tawakkul, rather it is essential to repent therefrom. 
4 – If the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) interpreted the words shirk or kufr in a manner which indicates that what is meant is a minor form thereof and not the major form. 
For example al-Bukhari (1038) and Muslim (74) narrated from Zayd ibn Khalid al-Juhani that he said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) led the morning prayer for us at al-Hudaybiyah following rainfall during the night. When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) finished, he turned to face the people and said to them: “Do you know what your Lord has said?” They said: “Allah and his Messenger know best.” He said: “This morning one of My slaves became a believer in Me and one a disbeliever. As for him who said: ‘We have been given rain by the grace of Allah and His mercy,’ that one is a believer in Me, a disbeliever in the stars; and as for him who said: ‘We have been given rain by such-and-such a star, that one is a disbeliever in Me, a believer in the stars.’” 
The interpretation of the word kufr here is given in another report narrated from Abu Hurayrah who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do you not know what your Lord said? ‘I do not send any blessing upon My slaves but a group among them become kafirs thereby because they refer to the stars and attribute things to the stars.'"" This explains that if a person attributes rainfall to the stars by believing that they caused it to fall – when in fact Allah has not made the stars a means of causing rainfall – his kufr is a kind of ingratitude for the blessing of Allah. It is well known that ingratitude for the blessing of Allah is minor kufr. But if a person believes that the stars are controlling the universe and they are the ones that cause the rain to fall, then this is major shirk. 
Types of minor shirk
Minor shirk may sometimes take the form of outward actions, such as wearing talismans, strings, amulets and the like, and other words and deeds. And sometimes it may be hidden, like a little bit of showing off. 
It may also take the form of beliefs: 
Such as the belief that something may be a cause of bringing benefit or warding off harm, when Allah has not made it so; or believing that there is barakah (blessing) in a thing, when Allah has not made it so. 
It sometimes takes the form of words: 
Such as when they said, “We have been given rain by such and such a star,” without believing that the stars could independently cause rain to fall; or swearing by something other than Allah, without believing in venerating the thing sworn by or regarding it as equal with Allah; or saying, “Whatever Allah wills and you will,” and so on. 
It sometimes takes the form of actions: 
Such as hanging up amulets or wearing a talisman or string to dispel or ward off calamity, because everyone who attributes powers to a thing when Allah has not made it so either according to shari’ah or according to the laws of the universe, has associated something with Allah. This also applies to one who touches a thing seeking its barakah (blessing), when Allah has not created any barakah in it, such as kissing the doors of the mosques, touching their thresholds, seeking healing from their dust, and other such actions. 
This is a brief look at the division of shirk into major and minor. We cannot go into great detail in this short answer. 
Tips for Muslims to avoid shirk
What the Muslim must do is to avoid shirk in both its minor and major forms. The greatest sin is shirk and transgression against the unique rights of Allah, which are (for Him) to be worshipped and obeyed Alone, with no partner or associate. 
Hence Allah has decreed that the mushrikin will abide forever in Hell and has told us that He will not forgive them, and He has forbidden Paradise to them, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Verily, Allah forgives not that partners should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He wills; and whoever sets up partners with Allah in worship, he has indeed invented a tremendous sin” [al-Nisa 4:48] 
“Verily, whosoever sets up partners (in worship) with Allah, then Allah has forbidden Paradise to him, and the Fire will be his abode. And for the Zalimun (polytheists and wrongdoers) there are no helpers” [al-Maidah 5:72] 
Every wise and religiously-committed person should fear shirk for himself and should turn to his Lord, asking Him to help him avoid shirk, as al-Khalil [Ibrahim – peace be upon him] said:  
“and keep me and my sons away from worshipping idols”
[Ibrahim 14:35 – interpretation of the meaning] 
One of the salaf said: “Who can claim to be safe from this after Ibrahim?” 
So the sincere believer’s fear of shirk should increase as should his desire for his Lord to keep him away from it, and he should say the great du’a which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught to his Companions when he said to them: “Shirk among you will be more subtle than the footsteps of an ant, but I will teach you something which, if you do it, both minor and major shirk will be kept away from you. Say: Allahumma inni a'udhu bika an ushrika bika wa ana a’lam wa astaghfiruka lima la a’lam (O Allah, I seek refuge with You from associating anything with You knowingly, and I seek Your forgiveness for that of which I am unaware).” (Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Jami’, 3731) 
Difference between major and minor shirk in terms of ruling
The above refers to the difference between major and minor shirk, defining each and describing its types. 
With regard to the difference between them as far as the ruling is concerned: 
Major shirk puts a person beyond the pale of Islam, so the one who does that is judged to be out of Islam and to have apostatized therefrom, so he is a kafir and an apostate. 
Minor shirk does not put a person beyond the pale of Islam, rather it may be done by a Muslim but he still remains in Islam; but the one who does that is in great danger because minor shirk is a major sin. Ibn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “If I were to swear by Allah falsely, that is better for me than if I were to swear by something other than Him sincerely.” So he regarded swearing by something other than Allah (which is minor shirk) as being worse than swearing by Allah falsely, and it is well known that swearing by Allah falsely is a major sin. 
We ask Allah to make our hearts steadfast in adhering to His religion until we meet Him, and we seek refuge in His Might – may He be glorified – from going astray, for He is the Ever-Living Who never dies, but the jinn and mankind will die. And Allah knows best and is most wise, and to Him is the final return of all.

This is confirmed by the words of Allaah: 
“While as for those who accept guidance, He increases their guidance and bestows on them their piety”
[Muhammad 47:17] 
“As for those who strive hard in Us (Our Cause), We will surely guide them to Our paths (i.e. Allaah’s religion — Islamic Monotheism)”
[al-‘Ankaboot 29:69]
But if a person is hindered from doing good deeds and avoiding haraam things – we seek refuge with Allaah – then that is a sign that Allaah is not pleased with him. 
Allaah has also explained in His Book that the sign of His being pleased with His slave and of His guidance is that He opens his heart to true guidance and true faith. And the sign of misguidance and being far from the Straight Path is distress and constriction in the heart. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And whomsoever Allaah wills to guide, He opens his breast to Islam; and whomsoever He wills to send astray, He makes his breast closed and constricted, as if he is climbing up to the sky. Thus Allaah puts the wrath on those who believe not”
[al-An’aam 6:125]
Ibn 'Abbaas said, commenting on this verse: “And whomsoever Allaah wills to guide…”: He opens his heart to Tawheed and belief therein. 
Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 2/175 
Another sign of Allaah’s love for His slave and His being pleased with him is that He makes him beloved to His slaves. Al-Bukhaari (3209) and Muslim (2637) narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When Allaah loves a person, He calls out to Jibreel: ‘Allaah loves So and so,’ so Jibreel loves him. Then Jibreel calls out to the people of heaven, ‘Allaah loves So and so, so love him.’ So the people of heaven love him and he finds acceptance on earth.” 
Al-Nawawi said: “and he finds acceptance on earth” means that people love him and are pleased to see him, so their hearts incline towards him. It says in another report: “and he finds love on earth.”

Sometimes while I am in one of those Islamic rooms in Paltalk,a muslim brother(looking for a wife) in the room asks me to have a private written chat with him so that we get to know one another. Some of the questions he asks me are: where i live, my age, whether i am married(by the way I am not married), if I am planning to get marry, whether I live with my parents, and so on. My problem is, I don't know whether I am allowed(Islamicly) to give non-muharim brother those kinds of informations which related to me.
Is it really SIN to talk to a brother in writing ??.",,,"Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with a Muslim woman making use of the internet and entering the Paltalk website for that purpose, so long as that does not lead to anything that is forbidden in Islam, such as talking privately with men. That is because talking to men may turn into chat which usually leads temptation. Hence it is essential to be strict and avoid that, seeking the pleasure of Allaah and fearing His punishment. 
How often have these conversations lead to bad results, and even caused people to fall in love, and have led some to do things that are even more serious than that. The Shaytaan makes each of them imagine attractive qualities in other, which leads them to develop an attachment that detrimental to their spiritual welfare and worldly affairs. 
Sharee’ah blocks all the ways that may lead to fitnah (temptation, trial), hence it forbids softness of speech and does not allow a man to be alone with a non-mahram woman. Undoubtedly these private chats are not regarded as khulwah in the sense that he people involved cannot see one another, but they are one of the greatest causes of fitnah as is well known. 
What has happened to you is the best testimonial to the truth of what we are saying, because it is difficult for a man to ask these personal questions of a believing woman, unless he uses these means that are being used in a bad way. 
Fear Allaah, and do not speak to non-mahram men. This is safer for your religious commitment and purer for your heart. You should note that marriage to a righteous man is a blessing from Allaah, and a blessing cannot be acquired by means of sin. 
Shaykh Ibn Jibreen (may Allaah preserve him) was asked: What is the ruling on correspondence between young men and women, if this correspondence is free from immorality and love? 
He replied: 
It is not permissible for any man to correspond with a woman who is not his mahram, because of the fitnah (temptation) involved in that. A person may think that there is no fitnah, but the Shaytaan will keep trying until he tempts him. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded those who heard of the Dajjaal to keep away from him, and said that a man may approach him as a believer, but the Dajjaal will keep trying until he leads him astray. 
Correspondence between young men and women involves a great deal of fitnah and danger, so we must avoid it, even though the questioner says that this correspondence is free from immorality and love.

    We have already discussed the ruling on standing up for one 
    who comes in, in question no.
    34497. This 
    ruling includes students standing up for the teacher. 

    Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    said: 

    I have heard that many teachers tell the students to stand up 
    for them when they enter the classroom. Undoubtedly this goes against the 
    saheeh Sunnah. 

    It was proven that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever likes the people to stand up 
    for him, let him take his place in Hell.” Narrated by Imam Ahmad, Abu Dawood 
    and al-Tirmidhi from Mu’aawiyah (may Allaah be pleased with him) with a 
    saheeh isnaad. Imam Ahmad and al-Tirmidhi also narrated with a saheeh isnaad 
    from Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him): “No person was dearer to them 
    than the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), but when 
    they saw him they did not stand up for him because they knew that he 
    disliked that.”  

    So the Sunnah is not to stand up for teachers when they enter 
    classrooms, in accordance with these two hadeeth and other similar reports. 

    It is not permissible for the teacher to tell them to stand 
    up for him, because of the warning mentioned concerning that in the hadeeth 
    of Mu’aawiyah, and it is makrooh for the students to stand up, because of 
    the hadeeth of Anas quoted above.  It is well known that all goodness is to 
    be found in following the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) and following his example and that of his 
    companions (may Allaah be pleased with them). May Allaah make us and you 
    among those who follow him in truth and help us to understand His religion 
    and adhere steadfastly to it.

34852,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34852,Result of Refraining From Joining the Congregation's Front Rows,I would like to know the commentary on this Hadith: “People will persist in falling back until Allah puts them back.”,"The Hadith highlights the consequence of continuously refraining from joining the front rows during congregational prayers, resulting in the inability to do so as a punishment from Allah.",,"Praise be to Allah.This Hadith was narrated by Muslim (438) from Abu Sa’id al-Khudri: that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw some of his companions falling back (in the rows for prayer) and said to them: “Come forward and follow me (in prayer), and let those who come after you follow you? People will persist in falling back until Allah puts them back.” 
The meaning of the Hadith is as follows: 

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw some of his Companions staying back from joining the front row, so he told them to come forward to the front row so that they could follow his lead and that those who were behind them, who could not see the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), could follow their lead. 
It may be interpreted as meaning: those of the Ummah who came after them could follow their example, because they would transmit to them the description of the prayer of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) which they had seen. This was the view of Al-Sindi (may Allah have mercy on him). 

Then he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “People will persist in falling back until Allah puts them back.” 
This means: people will keep getting used to staying away from the front row or rows, until Allah will punish them by putting them back. 
It was also said that the meaning is: He (Allah) will put them away from His mercy and Paradise, or His great bounty, or from being raised in status, or from knowledge.
There is no reason why the Hadith should not be interpreted in all of these ways. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said concerning the meaning of this Hadith: 
“The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw some people staying back in the mosque, i.e., they did not come forward to the front rows, so he said: “People will persist in falling back until Allah puts them back.” Based on this, it is feared that if a person gets used to falling back in worship, he will be punished by Allah putting him back with regard to all good things.'” (Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 13/54 )
Some of the scholars were of the view that what is meant by this is a group of hypocrites. The correct view is that the Hadith is general in meaning and does not apply only to the hypocrites. 
Al-Shawkani said in Nayl al-Awtar: 
“It was said that this is about the hypocrites, but the apparent meaning is that it is general and refers both to them and to others, and that it encourages worshippers to be keen on being in the front row and to put them off hanging back from the front row.” 
The point is that the Hadith encourages men to pray in the front row or rows, and condemns getting accustomed to praying in the back rows. 
We ask Allah to help us to hasten to do good deeds and to compete therein.

34854,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34854,Can Allaah be described as forgetting?,Can Allaah be described as forgetting?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Forgetting can mean two things: 

    1 – Overlooking something that is known, as in the verses 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Punish us not if we forget or fall into error”

    [al-Baqarah 2:286] 

    “And indeed We made a covenant with Adam before, but he 
    forgot, and We found on his part no firm will power”

    [Ta-Ha 20:115]

    - according to one of the two scholarly opinions. 

    And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said: “I am only human, I forget as you forget, so if I forget then 
    remind me.” 

    And he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 
    “Whoever sleeps and misses a prayer or forgets it, let him pray it when he 
    remembers it.” 

    This kind of forgetfulness cannot be attributed to Allaah, on 
    the basis of two kinds of evidence, textual and rational. 

    The textual evidence is the verse in which He says of Moosa 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “[Moosa (Moses)] said: ‘The knowledge thereof is with my 
    Lord, in a Record. My Lord neither errs nor He forgets’”

    [Ta-Ha 20:52]

    The rational evidence is the fact that forgetting is a fault 
    or shortcoming, and Allaah is far above having any shortcomings. He is 
    described as perfect, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “and for Allaah is the highest description. And He is the 
    All-Mighty, the All-Wise”
    [al-Nahl 16:60]

    Based on this it is not permissible to describe Allaah as 
    forgetting in this sense, under any circumstances. 

    The second meaning of forgetting is deliberately and 
    knowingly neglecting something, as in the verses (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “So, when they forgot (the warning) with which they had 
    been reminded, We opened for them the gates of every(pleasant) thing”

    [al-An’am 6:44] 

    “And indeed We made a covenant with Adam before, but he 
    forgot, and We found on his part no firm will power”

    [Ta-Ha 20:115]

    - this is according to the other scholarly opinion concerning 
    the meaning of this verse. 

    And the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him) said concerning the categories of those who own horses: 

    “… and a man who keeps them [horses] for earning his living 
    so as not to ask of others, but he does not forget Allaah’s rights (i.e., 
    zakaah on the wealth he earns through using them in trading etc) and does 
    not overburden them”  

    This kind of “forgetting” is ascribed to Allaah as He says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “Then taste you (the torment of the Fire) because of your 
    forgetting the Meeting of this Day of yours. Surely, We too will forget you”

    [al-Sajdah 32:14]

    And Allaah says concerning the hypocrites: 

    “They have forgotten Allaah, so He has forgotten them. 
    Verily, the hypocrites are the Faasiqoon (rebellious, disobedient to 
    Allaah)”

    [al-Tawbah 9:67]

    And in Saheeh Muslim, in Kitaab al-Zuhd 
    wa’l-Raqaa’iq it is narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased 
    with him) said: They said: “O Messenger of Allaah, will we see our Lord on 
    the Day of Resurrection?” … and in this hadeeth its says: “Allaah will meet 
    His [disbelieving] slave and will say: ‘Did you think that you would meet 
    Me?’ He will say, ‘No.’ He will say: ‘I will forget you as you forgot Me.’” 

    Allaah’s leaving or forgetting something is one of His 
    actions that happen by His will and in accordance with His wisdom. Allaah 
    says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “and left them in darkness. (So) they could not see”

    [al-Baqarah 2:17] 

    “We shall leave them to surge like waves on one another”

    [al-Kahf 18:99] 

    “And indeed We have left thereof an evident Ayah (a lesson 
    and a warning and a sign)”

    [al-‘Ankaboot 29:35]
There are many well-known 
    texts which confirm that Allaah leaves or forsakes things and also confirm 
    His other actions that have to do with His will. This is indicative of the 
    perfection of His power and might, and the way in which He does these 
    actions is not like the way in which His creation does things, even though 
    they share the same basic meaning, as is well known among Ahl al-Sunnah.",Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen 1/172-174

Is this action correct?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.These are some of the mistakes that are made when entering the Haram. They may be explained as follows: 
Firstly: 
Some people think that it is essential for the pilgrim doing Hajj or ‘Umrah to enter through a specific gate of al-Masjid al-Haraam. So some people think that if they are doing ‘Umrah they must enter through the gate called Baab al-‘Umrah, and that this is essential and is prescribed in sharee’ah. Others think that they must enter through Baab al-Salaam, and that entering through any other gate is a sin or is makrooh. There is no basis for this. The pilgrim doing Hajj or ‘Umrah may enter through any gate, but when he enters the mosque he should enter with his right foot first and say what is narrated for entering all mosques, and send blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and say, “Allaahumma aghfir li dhunoobi waftah li abwaab rahmatika (O Allaah forgive me and open to me the doors of Your Mercy).” Narrated by Muslim, 713. 
Secondly: 
Some people have invented specific du’aa’s for when one enters the Mosque and sees the Ka’bah, and have introduced du’aa’s that were not narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). This is a kind of bid’ah (innovation). Worshipping Allaah with words, actions or beliefs that were not known to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his companions is innovation and misguidance which the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) warned us against. 
Thirdly: 
Some people - even those who are not doing Hajj – mistakenly believe that the greeting for al-Masjid al-Haraam is tawaaf, in the sense that it is Sunnah for everyone who enters al-Masjid al-Haraam to do tawaaf, basing that on the view of some of the fuqaha’ that the Sunnah when entering al-Masjid al-Haraam is to do tawaaf. In fact this is not the case. Al-Masjid al-Haraam is like all other mosques, concerning which the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When any one of you enters the mosque, let him not sit down until he has prayed two rak’ahs.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 444; Muslim, 714. 
But if you enter al-Masjid al-Haraam to do tawaaf other than the tawaaf of Hajj or ‘Umrah, or for a voluntary tawaaf, then it is permissible for you to do tawaaf without praying two rak’ahs first. This is what is meant by saying that the greeting for al-Masjid al-Haraam is tawaaf. Based on this, if you enter with no intention to do tawaaf, rather you are waiting for the prayer or you are coming to attend a lesson etc, then al-Masjid al-Haraam is like any other mosque and it is Sunnah to pray two rak’ahs before you sit down, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) enjoined that.",From Daleel al-Akhta’ allati yaqa’ fiha al-Haaj wa’l-Mu’tamir by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him)
34890,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34890,The Hadeeth “There is no Mahdi except ‘Eesa” is not Saheeh,Is the hadeeth (prophetic narration) “There is no Mahdi except ‘Eesa” saheeh (authentic)?,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    This hadeeth was narrated by Ibn Majah in his Sunan (4039). 

    Almost all the muhadditheen (hadeeth scholars) are agreed 
    that this hadeeth is da’eef (weak).” 

    It was classed as da’eef by al-Bayhaqi, al-Hakim, Shaykh 
    al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah in Manhaj al-Sunnah (8/256), and Ibn al-Qayyim in 
    al-Manar al-Muneef (p.148). 

    Al-Thahabi said in Meezan al-I’tidal (3/535): it is a munkar 
    (rejected) report. 

    Al-Qari said in Mirqat al-Mafateeh (10/183): it is da’eef 
    according to the consensus of the muhadditheen. 

    It was mentioned by al-Shawkani in al-Qawaa’id al-Majmoo’ah, 
    127. He said: al-San’ani said: (it is) mawdoo’ (fabricated). 

    Al-Albani said in Silsilat al-Ahadeeth al-Da’eefah (77): It 
    is munkar. 

    Even if this hadeeth were saheeh – but it is not saheeh – the 
    meaning would be that there is no one who is perfectly guided (mahdi) or 
    protected from sin and error except ‘Eesa ibn Maryam (peace be upon him). 
    This was stated by al-Qurtubi, Ibn al-Qayyim and Ibn Katheer. 

    This does not contradict the fact that the Mahdi will emerge 
    at the end of time and that he will join forces with ‘Eesa ibn Maryam (peace 
    be upon him), and ‘Eesa will pray behind him in congregation. 

    We have already stated in the answer to question no. 
    
    
    1252 the evidence showing that the Mahdi 
    will emerge at the end of time with the attributes that the Prophet (peace 
    and blessings of Allah be upon him) described. These saheeh ahadeeth 
    (authentic narrations) cannot be contradicted by a da’eef hadeeth like this 
    one. 

    See al-Ahadeeth al-Da’eefah, 1/89 by al-Albani. Al-Mawsoo’ah

34898,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/34898,Man is following a course set by Allah and has freedom of choice,Does man has freedom of choice or is he following a course set by Allah?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen was asked this question and said: The questioner should ask himself whether anyone forced him to ask this question, and does he choose the kind of car that he drives? And other such questions. Then the answer as to whether he is following a course set by Allah or has freedom of choice will become clear to him.  
Then he should ask himself whether accidents happen to him by his choice? Or whether he falls sick by his choice? Or will he die by his choice? 
And other similar questions. Then the answer as to whether he is following a course set by Allah or has freedom of choice will become clear to him. 
The answer is that the things that the wise person does, he undoubtedly does by his choice. Listen to the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So, whosoever wills, let him seek a place with (or a way to) His Lord (by obeying Him in this worldly life)!” [al-Naba’ 78:39] 
“Among you are some that desire this world and some that desire the Hereafter” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:152] 
“And whoever desires the Hereafter and strives for it, with the necessary effort due for it (i.e. does righteous deeds of Allah’s obedience) while he is a believer (in the Oneness of Allah — Islamic Monotheism) — then such are the ones whose striving shall be appreciated, (thanked and rewarded by Allah)” [al-Isra’ 17:19] 
“he must pay a Fidyah (ransom) of either observing Sawm (fasts) (three days) or giving Sadaqah (charity — feeding six poor persons) or offering sacrifice (one sheep)” [al-Baqarah 2:196]
But if a person wants to do something and he does it, we know that Allah has willed it. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“To whomsoever among you who wills to walk straight.
And you cannot will unless (it be) that Allah wills — the Lord of the ‘Aalameen (mankind, jinn and all that exists)” [al-Takweer 81:28-29]
Because His Lordship (ruboobiyyah) is complete and perfect, nothing can happen in the heavens or on earth except by His will. 
With regard to things that happen to a person or that he does without choosing or willing them, such as sickness, death and accidents, they are purely divine will (al-qadar) and the person has no choice or will with regard to them. 
And Allah is the Source of strength.","Majmoo Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, vol. 2"
