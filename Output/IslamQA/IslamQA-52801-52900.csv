52801,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/52801,Ruling on opening a shop for elctronic games,"What is the ruling on owning a shop of electronic games for children? The child sits in front of the computer and plays in return for fees (2 SR) per hour. We know that the prophet prohibited playing with dice and playing chess, is it the same ruling for elctronic games? Why did the prophet prohibited these specific games?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    The ruling on opening a shop to rent electronic games is 
    based on the ruling on the games themselves. In the answer to question no.
    2898 we explained the ruling, 
    and stated that if these games are free of haraam things, then they are 
    permissible according to sharee’ah. So there is nothing wrong with renting 
    them to children, if they do not contain any of these haraam things, such as 
    images of naked women, games involving witchcraft and music, and so on. The 
    owner of the shop must choose games that are free of haraam things. 

    Secondly: 

    We have discussed the prohibition on chess and dice in the 
    answers to questions no. 22305 
    and 14095. 

    As for the wisdom behind the prohibition on these two games, 
    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    The ruling on playing with these things is that it is 
    forbidden, because they are tools of idleness that keep one from remembering 
    Allaah and praying. This is well known to the scholars, because they 
    distract and keep one from doing good. They also lead to competition and may 
    lead to much evil between the players, and may distract them from what 
    Allaah has enjoined. End quote. 

    Fataawa Ibn Baaz (8/98). 

    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    If the one who plays dice is disobeying Allaah and His 
    Messenger, even though the evil that results from that is little, then how 
    can the one who plays chess not be disobeying Allaah and His Messenger, when 
    the evil that results from it is greater, and it keeps the players from that 
    which Allaah and His Messenger love, and takes hold of the player’s mind, 
    and distracts him mentally and physically, and wastes his time, and dabbling 
    a little in it leads one to become more involved in it, just as drinking a 
    little wine leads to drinking a lot, and people are more keen to play it for 
    prizes than they are to play it for no prizes.  If there were no bad 
    consequences involved in playing it other than it being a means to consume 
    haraam wealth by gambling, it would be forbidden in sharee’ah, so how about 
    when the evils that result from simply playing mean that it is haraam? 

    How can one think that sharee’ah would permit that which 
    distracts one so much from one’s religious and worldly interests, and 
    generates enmity and resentment between the players, and a little of it 
    leads to a lot, and affects the mind and reason as intoxicants do, if not 
    more so? Hence the player becomes more devoted to it than the wine drinker 
    to his wine, or more so, because he does not feel shy or afraid as the wine 
    drinker does, and both of them are akin to the one who is devoted to idols.

52803,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/52803,Is there any expiation for having intercourse with a woman in her back passage?,Is there any expiation for having intercourse with one’s wife in her back passage?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: 
It is haraam to have intercourse with one’s wife in her back passage, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said that the one who does that is cursed. 
We have quoted the evidence from the Qur’aan and Sunnah to show that it is haraam, as well as describing some of the evil consequences of that, in the answer to question no. 1103 and 6792. 
Islam has not stipulated any expiation for this action, so there is no expiation for it apart from repentance and regret, and turning back to Allah. 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the ruling on having intercourse with a woman in her back passage? Is there any expiation required of the one who does that?  
He replied: 
Having intercourse with a woman in her back passage is a major sin and is one of the most heinous acts of disobedience, because it was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Cursed is the one who has intercourse with his wife in her back passage.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2162; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood. 
And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah will not look at a man who had intercourse with a man or a woman in the back passage.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1166; classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
What the one who has done that must do is hasten to repent sincerely, which means giving up the sin and abstaining from it out of respect for Allah and out of fear of His punishment, regretting what he has done of that and sincerely resolving never to go back to it, as well as striving to do righteous deeds. Whoever repents sincerely, Allah will accept his repentance and forgive his sins, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And verily, I am indeed forgiving to him who repents, believes (in My Oneness, and associates none in worship with Me) and does righteous good deeds, and then remains constant in doing them (till his death)”
[Ta-Ha 20:82]
“And those who invoke not any other ilaah (god) along with Allah, nor kill such person as Allah has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse and whoever does this shall receive the punishment.
69. The torment will be doubled to him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace;
70. Except those who repent and believe (in Islamic Monotheism), and do righteous deeds; for those, Allah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allah is Oft‑Forgiving, Most Merciful”
[al-Furqaan 25:68-70] 
There is no expiation required of one who has anal intercourse, according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions, and his wife does not become haraam to him because of that, rather she remains his wife. But she does not have to obey him in this grave evil; rather she is obliged to refuse, and to demand a annulment of her marriage to him if he does not repent. We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound from that. 
From Fataawa Islamiyyah, 3/256 
Al-Bayhaqi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
If he does that (i.e., has intercourse with her in the back passage), then he should be punished (i.e., the judge or ruler should mete out a punishment that will deter him and others like him), because he has committed a sin for which there is no stipulated hadd punishment or expiation. 
Kashshaaf al-Qinaa’, 5/190 
So he clearly stated that it is a sin, but no expiation is required. 
See Ansa al-Mataalib, 4/162; Mughni al-Muhtaaj, 5/624 
Secondly: 
Many people make the mistake of thinking that because there is no expiation stipulated for a particular sin that it is an insignificant matter and is a minor sin. This way of thinking is not correct. Rather if one were to say that Allah has not stipulated any expiation for anal intercourse because it is too serious to be expiated by any expiation, that would not be farfetched. As Imam Maalik says concerning swearing a false oath (al-yameen al-ghamoos): it is too serious to be expiated by any expiation.

52804,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/52804,Ruling on hiring a woman to bear the daff for women,"Is it permissible to bring a woman singer to a wedding party, if we stipulate that she should only sing songs that are not immoral in content and use the daff only, and not put loudspeakers outside?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.If the matter is as described in the question and the shar’i conditions of using the daff only in a wedding party will be adhered to, then there is nothing wrong with bringing a female singer and paying her for her work. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
As for giving money to women who play the daff, there is nothing wrong with it, because that is a payment for permissible work. But giving money to women who play other kinds of drums is not permissible, because that is payment for haraam work. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When Allaah forbids a thing, he forbids its price.” Narrated by Ibn Hibbaan, 4938; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Ghaayat al-Maraam, 318. 
End quote. Liqa’ al-Baab il-Maftooh, 1/580. See al-Liqa’ al-Shahri, 235 
We must point out here that beating the daff at wedding parties and paying someone to do that is permissible in principle, but it may be accompanied by haraam or makrooh things which make it disallowed. 
Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem (may Allaah have mercy on him) said:   
Beating the daff at weddings is permissible according to sharee’ah so as to announce the wedding, but if other evil consequences happen as a result of that, then it is not allowed. End quote. 
Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 10/218 
Examples of that include dancing to this daff. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
Dancing is makrooh, especially if there is the fear of fitnah (temptation) as a result, because sometimes the dancer may be young and beautiful, and her dancing may provoke desire even in women. End quote. 
Liqa’ al-Baab al-Maftooh, 1/580 
See also question no.  5000 and 9290 
Another example is extravagance in the fee paid. 
The fee paid to the woman who beats the daff should be reasonable, not extravagant. Allaah says, forbidding extravagance (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and waste not by extravagance. Verily, He likes not Al‑Musrifoon (those who waste by extravagance)”
[al-An’aam 6:141]
This extravagance may be a cause of blessing being taken away from this marriage. It is narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The woman who brings the greatest blessing is the one whose wedding arrangements are the most moderate.” Narrated by Ahmad, 24595; classed as saheeh by al-Haakim, and al-Dhahabi agreed with him. Al-‘Iraaqi said in Takhreej Ahaadeeth al-Ihya’: its isnaad is jayyid. 
But it was classed as da’eef by al-Haythami in Majma’ al-Zawaa’id, 7332; and by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Da’eefah, 1117. 
And Allaah knows best.",Islam Q&A
52807,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/52807,She told a lie against her husband; how can she set things straight?,"I have a relative who went back to her father’s house two days after her wedding and told him that the man whom she had married did not pray and that he had said to her obscene words that no sane man would say. She asked her father to ask him for a divorce. Her mahr was 40,000 riyals, but after matters got very complicated and the husband delayed producing the divorce papers, they agreed to give back 30,000 riyals of the mahr. 

The first question is: the woman is asking whether there is any sin on her for taking this ten thousand? She wants to give it back to him so that she can have a clear conscience, but she cannot; can she donate it? 

The second question is: the woman says that she told her father about some things that the husband said and some things that he did to her, and she was telling the truth in that, but she also told her father some things that the husband did not do or say. Is this a serious lie (buhtaan) and how can she ask for his forgiveness, seeing that she cannot go to him and does not know where he is?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
      Firstly:  The basic principle is that if a woman is 
      divorced after the marriage has been consummated, she is entitled to keep 
      the mahr in full. If the husband did not divorce her until after the mahr 
      was returned to him, this is khula’, which is permissible in return for 
      the mahr, or more or less than that. 

    Based on this, your relative does not have to return the ten 
    thousand to her ex-husband, so long as they agreed that she can keep it. 

    Secondly: If the woman attributed words or deeds to her 
    husband of which he was innocent, then this is a serious lie and is haraam. 
    What she has to do is to repent to Allaah and pray for her husband and for 
    forgiveness for him. She does not have to tell him about that or ask for his 
    forgiveness. The same applies to anyone who backbites or tells lies about 
    another person; it is not a condition of repentance that he should tell him 
    about that, because of the enmity and hatred that that may lead to. 

    Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in 
    al-Waabil al-Sayyib, p. 219: 
Chapter 56: What a 
    person who has gossiped about his Muslim brother should say: 

    It is narrated from the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) that the expiation for backbiting is to pray for 
    forgiveness for the one concerning whom you gossiped. You should say: O 
    Allaah, forgive us and him. This was narrated by al-Bayhaqi in al-Da’waat 
    al-Kabeer, but he said there is some weakness in its isnaad. 
There are two scholarly 
    opinions concerning this issue, both of which were narrated from Imam Ahmad. 
    The issue is: in repenting from backbiting is it sufficient to pray for 
    forgiveness for the one about whom you gossiped, or must you also tell him 
    and ask for his forgiveness? 

    The correct view is that there is no need to tell him, rather 
    it is sufficient to pray for forgiveness and to speak of his good points in 
    the places where you gossiped about him. This is the view favoured by Shaykh 
    al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and others. Those who say that it is essential to tell 
    him regarded backbiting as being like financial rights, but the difference 
    between them is obvious. In the case of financial rights, the person who is 
    wronged benefits from the restoration of his rights; if he wishes he may 
    keep it and if he wishes he may give it in charity. But in the case of 
    backbiting, that is not possible and the only thing that results from 
    telling him is the opposite of what the Lawgiver seeks, for it will upset 
    him and hurt his feelings if he hears what was said about him, and it may 
    stir up enmity that can never be assuaged, and there is no point in that. So 
    the wise Lawgiver would never permit or allow it, let alone enjoin it or 
    command it. The aim of sharee’ah is to reduce and eliminate evil, not stir 
    it up and make it worse. And Allaah knows best. 

    Al-Safaareeni said in Sharh Manzoomah al-Adaab, 
    2/577. 

    Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr says in his book Bahjat al-Majaalis: 
    Hudhayfah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The expiation of one who 
    has gossiped is to pray for forgiveness (for that person). ‘Abd-Allaah ibn 
    al-Mubaarak said: The way to repent from backbiting is to pray for 
    forgiveness for the one about whom you gossiped. 

    It says in al-Adaab al-Kubra something similar to what 
    Ibn al-Mubaarak said, and this was the view favoured by Shaykh Taqiy al-Deen 
    and by Ibn al-Salaah al-Shaafa’i in his fatwas. 
Shaykh al-Islam (may 
    Allaah be pleased with him) said, after mentioning the two reports 
    concerning this matter: every aspersion against a person’s honour, whether 
    it is truthful or is a lie, comes under the heading of qadhaf (slander), 
    because qadhaf may be true, in which case it is gheebah (backbiting), or it 
    may be false, in which case it is buhtaan (lying). Our companions favoured 
    the view that the victim should not be told, rather du’aa’ should be offered 
    for him, because telling him would cause more hurt and annoyance, and if a 
    person is harmed by knowing what has been said about him, that causes more 
    harm than if he does not know. Telling him leads to these two evils and 
    there is a third evil – even if it is true – which is the destruction of any 
    friendship that may have existed between them, or the renewal of enmity and 
    hatred. Allaah has enjoined us to unite and not to divide. This evil may be 
    worse in some cases than in others. 

    End quote. 
Those scholars who said 
    that it is essential to seek the forgiveness of the one who has been wronged 
    in this matter exempted the backbiter from having to do that if the victim 
    is dead or absent. In that case it is sufficient to pray for forgiveness for 
    him, make du’aa’ for him and do a lot of good deeds.

52809,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/52809,"In the event of manslaughter, the diyah is required from the killer’s family and expiation is required from the killer","If a Muslim kills another Muslim by mistake, such as if he kills him unintentionally in a car accident, what does he have to do?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.What must be done in the event of accidental killing is two things: diyah (blood money) and kafaarah (expiation). 
Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“It is not for a believer to kill a believer except (that it be) by mistake; and whosoever kills a believer by mistake, (it is ordained that) he must set free a believing slave and a compensation (blood money, i.e. Diya) be given to the deceased’s family unless they remit it”
[al-Nisa’ 4:92]
In the event of manslaughter, the diyah must be paid by the ‘aaqilah of the killer, i.e., by his male relatives on his father’s side, the father, paternal grandfathers, full brothers, half-brothers on the father’s side and their sons, and paternal uncles and their sons. This is the view of Abu Haneefah, Maalik and Ahmad. 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’ (11/77): The ‘aaqilah includes all male relatives on the father’s side, whether they are heirs or not. The husband, half-brother on the mother’s side and mother’s father are not part of the ‘aaqilah. End quote. 
The judge should divide the shares of diyah to be paid among the male relatives according to the closeness of the relationship and how rich they are. The closer relatives should shoulder more of a burden than more distant relatives, and those who are richer should shoulder more of the burden, and those who are poor do not have to pay anything.  
See al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 11/80 
Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni, 12/21 
We do not know of any differing opinion among the scholars; they are agreed that the diyah in the case of accidental killing must be paid by the ‘aaqilah. Ibn al-Mundhir said: There is consensus on this matter among all those scholars from whom we learned. There are proven reports from the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) which state that he ruled that the diyah must be paid by the ‘aaqilah, and the scholars are unanimously agreed upon this point. 
What this means is that because accidental harm  may happen frequently and the diyah for killing a human being is great, making it obligatory for the offender and taking it from his wealth may be unfair to him. So wisdom dictates that it should be imposed on the ‘aaqilah so as to help the offender, and reduce his burden, if there is an excuse for what he did, but he alone has to offer the kafaarah (expiation). End quote. 
It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (21/238): 
The ruling that the diyah must be paid by the family (‘aaqilah) applies only in cases of accidental killing or quasi-intentional killing. In cases of deliberate killing the diyah is not borne by the family, rather it is to be paid only by the killer. If the members of the ‘aaqilah agree to share the burden with him or to help him to pay the diyah, there is nothing wrong with that. End  quote. 
With regard to the kafaarah (expiation), it must be paid by the killer. The expiation is to free a believing slave; if that is not possible, then he must fast for two consecutive months. This is mentioned in the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“It is not for a believer to kill a believer except (that it be) by mistake; and whosoever kills a believer by mistake, (it is ordained that) he must set free a believing slave and a compensation (blood money, i.e. Diya) be given to the deceased’s family unless they remit it. If the deceased belonged to a people at war with you and he was a believer, the freeing of a believing slave (is prescribed); and if he belonged to a people with whom you have a treaty of mutual alliance, compensation (blood money — Diya) must be paid to his family, and a believing slave must be freed. And whoso finds this (the penance of freeing a slave) beyond his means, he must fast for two consecutive months in order to seek repentance from Allaah. And Allaah is Ever All‑Knowing, All‑Wise”

Is it permissible to avoid the taxes by not telling them that I have found work, thus getting both the monthly allowance and a salary?

We have quoted on several previous occasions the evidence to prove that it is not permissible for a Muslim to settle in any kaafir country except in cases of need or necessity, subject to certain conditions. 
See questions no. 3225 and 13363. 
Secondly: 
If a Muslim enters such a country, he must adhere to the conditions that have been stipulated. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Fulfil (your) obligations”
[al-Maa'idah 5:1]
It is not permissible for a Muslim to betray them or cheat them. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Render back trusts to the one who entrusted you, and do not betray the one who betrays you.” Narrated by Abu Dawood, 3534; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.  
And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) described one of the attributes of the hypocrite as being: “When he enters into a covenant, he proves treacherous.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 34; Muslim, 58. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to send his companions to fight the mushrikeen, and one of the things he advised them was: “Do not be treacherous.” Narrated by Muslim, 1731. 
This is something which demonstrates the greatness of Islam and the perfection of its laws, for it forbids its followers to be treacherous or to cheat even its enemies. 
This state has allowed you to stay there, subject to certain conditions, so you are obliged to fulfil them. 
Based on this, it is not permissible for you to conceal your work from them so that you can avoid paying taxes and take the monthly allowance when it is not permissible for you.

    sense that my face is uncovered, but I do not make a wanton display of

    The committee replied: 

    A woman is obliged to cover her face in front of the husband 
    of her female cousin and the husband of her sister, and the husband of her 
    brother’s daughter, because they are strangers (non-mahrams) to her. It is 
    not permissible for her to uncover her face in front of them, as is the case

    ‘awrahs that must be covered in front of men, because it is the site of 
    fitnah (temptation) and looking. End quote. 

    His simply staying over at your house is not haraam in and of 
    itself, if all precautions are taken and there is no danger of anything 
    happening that Allaah has forbidden. 

    But, since the house in which you live is small as you 
    describe, then your sister and her husband should look for another house and 
    move there, if they are living with you on a permanent basis, or reduce the 
    length of their visits to you, if they are just visiting you. During those 
    times you must not be negligent with regard to observing hijab in front of

“It is only those who have knowledge among His slaves that fear Allaah”
[Faatir 35:28]
The subject here is al-‘ulamaa’ (those who have knowledge). They are the ones who fear Allaah. The structure of the sentence in Arabic, where the word “Allaah” is maf’ool muqaddam (i.e., object appearing before the subject?) emphasizes the fact that no one fears Allaah except those who have knowledge. If the subject were mentioned first, that would change the meaning so that it would mean, “those who have knowledge fear nothing but Allaah,” but this is not correct, for there are some knowledgeable people who fear things other than Allaah. 
Hence Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said concerning this verse: 
This indicates that everyone who fears Allaah has knowledge, which is true; it does not indicate that everyone who has knowledge fears Him. 
From Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 7/539. 
See also Tafseer al-Baydaawi, 4/418; Fath al-Qadeer, 4/494. 
This verse also indicates that the ones who have knowledge are the people who fear Allaah, and that whoever does not fear his Lord does not have knowledge.

Those who fear Him as He should be feared are those who have knowledge of Him, because the more a person knows of the Almighty, All-Powerful, the more he will fear Him. 
‘Ali ibn Abi Talhah narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas said, concerning the verse “It is only those who have knowledge among His slaves that fear Allaah”: Those who know that Allaah is Able to do all things…  
Sa’eed ibn Jubayr said: Fear is that which prevents you from disobeying Allaah. Al-Hasan al-Basri said: The one who has knowledge is the one who fears the Most Merciful in private, and seeks that which Allaah wants for him and abstains from that which incurs the wrath of Allaah. Then al-Hasan recited the verse: “It is only those who have knowledge among His slaves that fear Allaah. Verily, Allaah is All‑Mighty, Oft‑Forgiving”. 
It was narrated that Ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The sign of knowledge is not narrating many ahaadeeth, rather the sign of knowledge is fearing Allaah a great deal… 
Sufyaan al-Thawri narrated from Abu Hayyaan al-Taymi that a man said: It was said that those who have knowledge are of three types: those who have knowledge of Allaah and knowledge of the commands of Allaah, those who have knowledge of Allaah but do not have knowledge of the commands of Allaah, and those who have knowledge of the commands of Allaah but do not have knowledge of Allaah.  The one who has knowledge of Allaah and of the command of Allaah is the one who fears Allaah and knows the limits and obligations. The one who has knowledge of Allaah but does not have knowledge of the commands of Allaah is the one who fears Allaah but does not know the limits and obligations. And the one who has knowledge of the commands of Allaah but does not have knowledge of Allaah is the one who knows the limits and obligations but does not fear Allaah. 
End quote from Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 4/729. 
Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 17/21: 
The meaning of the verse “It is only those who have knowledge among His slaves that fear Allaah” is that no one fears Him except the one who has knowledge. Allaah tells us that everyone who fears Allaah has knowledge, as He says in another verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Is one who is obedient to Allaah, prostrating himself or standing (in prayer) during the hours of the night, fearing the Hereafter and hoping for the Mercy of his Lord (like one who disbelieves)? Say: ‘Are those who know equal to those who know not?’”
[al-Zumar 39:9]

Al-Sa’di (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
The more a person knows Allaah, the more he will fear Him, and the fear of Allaah will make him refrain from sin and prepare to meet the One Whom he fears. This is indicative of the virtue of knowledge, for it calls one to fear Allaah. The people who fear Allaah are the ones who will be honoured by Him, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Allaah will be pleased with them, and they with Him. That is for him who fears his Lord”
[al-Bayyinah 98:8]
End quote. 
To conclude: the subject of the sentence is “those who have knowledge”, and the meaning of the verse is that no one fears Allaah except those who have knowledge, who are the ones who know of His might and power. 
The verse does not mean that Allaah is the One Who fears those who have knowledge, exalted be He far above any such thing. 
We ask Allaah to bless us with beneficial knowledge and righteous deeds.

52822,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/52822,She wants to take the notebook of her servant on the grounds that she taught her what is in it,"We have a servant woman working in the house with us, and she is not Muslim. My mother taught her all kinds of food until she mastered them, and she in turn (i.e., the servant) wrote down what she learned in a notebook that belongs to her. 

 My question is: Now my mother wants to take the notebook that belongs to the servant without her knowledge, on the grounds that she is the one who taught her, and she has the right to take what she taught her. Is that regarded as wronging the servant?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Firstly: 

    Bringing kaafir servants and entrusting them with our homes 
    and children poses a great danger to the morals and religious commitment of 
    the children. 

    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    With regard to employing kaafir women as servants, whether 
    they are Buddhists, Christians or other kinds of kaafirs, is not permissible 
    in this Peninsula, i.e., in the Arabian Peninsula, because the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade that and urged that the 
    kuffaar be expelled from Arabia, for it is the cradle of Islam and the place 
    where the Message first dawned. So it is not permissible for two religions 
    to co-exist there, and it is not permissible to bring any kaafir there 
    except in cases of necessity as decreed by the authorities, then he (the 
    kaafir) should return to his homeland. End quote. 

    Fataawa Ibn Baaz, 6/361 

    Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said: 
Because a kaafir woman 
    should not remain among you in your house with your family and children, 
    even if the harm is no more than when the family get up to pray and this 
    woman does not pray, the children say: “Why doesn’t this woman pray?” and 
    they love her, so in that case they will think that it is not essential to 
    pray. This is even if she does not teach them her religion, as some people 
    have told us that they heard the servant teaching the children to say that 
    Jesus is God – we ask Allaah to keep us safe and sound. End quote.

    See also questions no. 22980,

    31242 

    Secondly: 
The scholars have stated 
    that it is permissible to take payment for teaching worldly skills, and 
    undoubtedly cooking and food preparation are skills that are very important 
    nowadays. 

    It says in al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (13/66): 

    There is no dispute among the scholars that it is permissible 
    to hire a person to teach permissible skills and professions which have to 
    do with worldly interests, such as sewing, blacksmithing, construction, 
    agriculture, weaving and so on. End quote. 

    Thirdly: 

    Based on the above, it is permissible according to sharee’ah 
    for your mother to take a payment for teaching the servant different ways of 
    cooking, but she should have told the servant of that before she started to 
    teach her. As for the situation mentioned in the question, the servant has 
    learned how to make food with the encouragement of your mother who chose to 
    do that. She is the one who helped her to do that of her own free will. So 
    it is not permissible for her to take the servant’s notebook in which she 
    has written down what she learned, because it is her property which she has 
    written with her own hand and taken care of. Your mother’s teaching of her 
    was purely voluntary. 

    Beware of mistreating her and taking what is rightfully hers, 
    even if she is not Muslim. 

    Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said (6/362) 
    to one who brought in a kaafir servant and mistreated her: 

    What you and your mother have to do is to send her back to 
    her country. It is not permissible for you or your mother to mistreat her, 
    rather what you must do is treat her in a kind manner while she is with you, 
    until she returns to her country, because Allaah has forbidden wrongdoing to 
    His slaves to mistreat even with regard to kaafirs, as the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Beware of wrongdoing, for 
    wrongdoing will be darkness on the Day of Resurrection.” Narrated by Muslim, 
    2578. And he  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said that 
    Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, said: “O My slaves, I have 
    forbidden wrongdoing to Myself and I have made it haraam among you, so do 
    not wrong one another.” Narrated by Muslim, 2577. End quote.

We collect the Zakah in Ramadan and then distribute it the whole year among the poor in the form of money and food stuff. Does Shari`ah allow this?","There is nothing wrong with giving Zakah before one full year has passed, one or two years in advance, if a good purpose will be served by that, and it is given to a deserving poor family on a monthly basis.","Can you give Zakah to non-Muslims? 


Can you delay Zakah?


Can you pay Zakah monthly?","Praise be to Allah.Can you give Zakah to non-Muslims? 
It is not permissible to give Zakah on wealth or Zakat Al-fitr to non-Muslims , except the one who is inclined towards Islam , in the sense that you hope that he will become Muslim if you give him Zakah. 
Can you delay Zakah?
Once Zakah becomes due on wealth, it must be paid immediately, and it is not permissible to delay it . 
Ibn Qudamah Al-Maqdisi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“If he delays it – i.e., Zakah – in order to give it to one who is more entitled to it among his relatives, or to one who is in great need, if it is a small amount there is nothing wrong with that, but if it is a large amount, it is not permissible.” (Al-Mughni, 2/290) 
The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked about an organization which collects Zakah from the rich then delays distributing it for a year, on the grounds that there is help in the springtime, help in Ramadan and so on. What is the ruling on this delay, since the owners of the wealth have discharged their duty of paying Zakah and have given it to us (to distribute)? 
They replied: 
“This organization should distribute the Zakah to those who are entitled to it and not delay it if they have found people who are entitled to it.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah li’l-Buhuth Al-’Ilmiyyah wa’l-Ifta’, 9/402) 
But on occasion it may be more useful not to give the Zakah to a poor person in one go, so that he will not spend it all and be left with no money; in that case he may be given something each month. 
In this case you should discuss the matter with the rich, and collect Zakah from them a year ahead, then give it to the poor in monthly installments, or take it from the rich ahead of time in installments and give it to the poor in monthly payments. Then it will not be delayed after it has become obligatory. This requires discussing it with the rich and convincing them of the good purposes that will be served by that. 
Can you pay Zakah monthly?
Ibn Qudamah Al-Maqdisi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Ahmad said: It is not permissible to give Zakah to his relatives in monthly installments, i.e., he should not delay paying it so that he can give it to them in separate amounts, giving them something each month. But if he pays it all to them ahead of time, or to others in separate payments or all at once, that is permissible because it is not being delayed from its time.” (Al-Mughni, 2/290) 
The scholars of the Standing Committee were asked: 
Is it permissible for me to pay my Zakah in advance for the whole year, in the form of regular payments to a poor family each month? 
They replied: 
“There is nothing wrong with giving Zakah before one full year has passed, one or two years in advance, if a good purpose will be served by that, and it is given to a deserving poor family on a monthly basis.” (Fatawa Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah, 9/422)

“Witr is part of the night prayer, and it is Sunnah and it is the end of the night prayer, one Rak`ah with which one concludes the night prayers at the end of the night, or in the middle of the night, or at the beginning of the night after ‘Isha’ prayer. You pray whatever you can, then you conclude it with one Rak`ah.” (Fatawa Ibn Baz, 11/309)
Shaykh Ibn`Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“The Sunnah – both in word and in deed – distinguishes between the night prayers and Witr prayer . The scholars also distinguished between them with regard to the ruling and the way in which they are done. 
How the Sunnah distinguishes between night prayers and Witr 
With regard to differentiation made in the Sunnah, according to the Hadith of Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), a man asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): How are the night prayers done ? He said: “Two by two, then when you fear that dawn is about to break, pray Witr with one Rak`ah.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari. See Al-Fat-h, 3/20) 
How the Prophet differentiated between night prayers and Witr
With regard to the way in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) differentiated between them in his actions, according to the Hadith of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her): The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to pray when I was lying down across his bed. When he wanted to pray Witr, he would wake me up and I would pray Witr. (Narrated by Al-Bukhari. See Al-Fat-h, 2/487). It was also narrated by Muslim (1/51) with the wording: “He used to offer his prayers at night when I was lying in front of him.” Then when only Witr was left, he would wake her up and she would pray Witr. 
Muslim also narrated (1/508) that she  (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to pray thirteen Rak`ahs at night , five of which were Witr, in which he would not sit except at the end. And he narrated from her (1/513) that when Sa’d ibn Hisham said to her: “Tell me about the Witr of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him),” she said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to pray nine rak`ahs during which he would not sit except in the eighth Rak`ah, when he would remember Allah and praise Him and call upon Him, then he would get up without saying the salam, then he would stand and pray the ninth Rak`ah, then he would sit and remember Allah (Dhikr) and praise Him and call upon Him, then he would say a Taslim that we could hear.” 
How the scholars differentiated between the ruling on Witr and night prayers 
With regard to the way in which the scholars differentiated between the ruling on Witr and the night prayers , the scholars differed as to whether Witr is obligatory. Abu Hanifah was of the view that it is obligatory, and this was narrated from Ahmad in Al-Insaf and Al-Furu`. Ahmad said: Whoever fails to pray Witr deliberately is a bad man whose testimony should not be accepted. 
The well known view in our madhhab is that Witr is Sunnah. This is the view of Malik and Al-Shafi`i. 
With regard to the night prayers, there is no such scholarly dispute. In Fat-h Al-Bari (3/27) it says: I have not seen anyone narrate the view that it is obligatory except for some of the Tabi’in. Ibn ‘Abd Al-Barr said: Some of the Tabi’in held an odd view and said that Qiyam Al-layl is obligatory, even if it is done only for the length of time that it takes to milk a sheep. But the view of the majority of scholars is that it is recommended. End quote. 
How the scholars differentiate between the ways in which Witr and night prayers are done
With regard to the scholars’ differentiating between the ways in which Witr and the night prayers are done, our Hanbali jurists have clearly stated that they are done differently. They said: The night prayers are done two by two, and they said concerning Witr: Witr may be prayed with five, or seven, Rak`ahs, in which one does not sit except in the last one. If a person prays Witr with nine Rak`ahs, he should sit immediately after the eighth Rak`ah and recite the tashahhud, then he should stand up before saying the salam and do the ninth Rak`ah, then he should say the tashahhud and the salam. This is what was stated by the author of Zad Al-Mustaqni`.” (Majmu` Fatawa Ibn `Uthaymin, 13/262-264) 
Thus it is clear that Witr prayer is part of the night prayers, but it differs from them in some minor details such as how it is done.

Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: What is the ruling on the person praying behind the imam holding the Mushaf during Taraweeh prayers? 
He replied: 
I do not know of any basis for that. It seems that he should focus with proper humility and not hold the Mushaf, rather he should place his right hand over his left as is the Sunnah, placing the right hand over the left wrist and forearm and placing them over his chest. This is the most correct view and is best. Holding the Mushaf will distract him from these Sunnahs, and his heart and eyes may become busy following the words on the pages and that may distract him from listening to the imam. What I think is that not doing that is the Sunnah, and that he should listen attentively and not use the Mushaf. If he has knowledge he will be able to prompt his imam, otherwise others will prompt him. Then if it so happens that the imam makes a mistake and is not corrected, that does not matter, unless it is in Soorat al-Faatihah, rather it matters only in Soorat al-Faatihah, because al-Faatihah is a pillar of the prayer which is essential. But if he omits some verses other than al-Faatihah, that does not matter if there is no one behind him who can alert him to that. If someone holds the Mushaf to correct the imam in the case of necessity, then there is nothing wrong with that. But if each person holds a Mushaf, that is contrary to the Sunnah. End quote. 
He was also asked (may Allah have mercy on him): 
Some members of the congregation follow the imam’s recitation in the Mushaf when he is reciting. Is there anything wrong with that? 
He replied: 
It seems to me that this should not be done. It is better to concentrate and focus on the prayer, and to place the hands on the chest and ponder what the imam is reciting, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So, when the Quran is recited, listen to it, and be silent that you may receive mercy” [al-A’raaf 7:204] 
“Successful indeed are the believers.
2. Those who offer their Salaah (prayers) with all solemnity and full submissiveness”

52886,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/52886,Is it permissible for him to trim his beard so that he will not be exposed to harm?,"My friend is going to get married in an Islamic country. Alhamdillah he is a practicing Muslim ( May Allah taala guide us all) and observes the sunnah of ""leaving the beard"". In this country where he is going, those with long beards are detained (especially those of Pakistani origin) at the airport and the secret police often follow them. He does not want to cause hardship to his wife's family, who are likely to be followed and harassed by the government. Therefore, he wishes to trim his beard slightly just for this occasion and grow it back. If not for the possibility of bringing hardship to his in-laws he would not want to trim. Please advise .",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Letting the beard grow is obligatory according to sharee’ah, 
    and shaving it is haraam. In the answer to question no.
    1189 we have stated the ruling on 
    shaving the beard, and that shaving it is a haraam action. 

    Ibn Hazm (may Allaah have mercy on him) narrated that the 
    scholars are unanimously agreed that it is not permissible to shave the 
    beard. 

    Al-Muhalla, 2/189 
With regard to shaving 
    it for fear of persecution or exposure to harm, this fear is not all of one 
    level.  In some cases it may be what is likely to happen, and in other cases 
    it may be imaginary, and in yet others it may be six of one and half a dozen 
    of the other.  

    It is not permissible for him to shave his beard or trim it 
    except in cases where harm is likely to result, and it is not permissible in 
    any other situation. 

    This comes under the heading of cases of necessity. Allaah 
    says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “But if one is forced by necessity without willful 
    disobedience nor transgressing due limits, then there is no sin on him. 
    Truly, Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful”

    [al-Baqarah 2:173]

    Or in cases of compulsion. Allaah says (interpretation of the 
    meaning): 

    “Whoever disbelieved in Allaah after his belief, except 
    him who is forced thereto and whose heart is at rest with Faith; but such as 
    open their breasts to disbelief, on them is wrath from Allaah, and theirs 
    will be a great torment”

    [al-Nahl 16:106]

    Force or compulsion means that he will be harmed if he does 
    not shave it. As for simply experiencing some annoyance or questions or 
    investigation, these are things from which those who do shave their beards 
    are not necessarily safe, so that does not mean that a person is permitted 
    to fall into sin. 

    In cases of compulsion, there are conditions which must be 
    met in order for it to be permissible for a Muslim to be granted the 
    concession of doing or saying something that is haraam. Understanding what 
    these conditions are is very important, because many people are claiming 
    that they are forced to do things when that is not the case. 

    Ibn Qudaamah said: 

    The conditions of compulsion include three things: 

    1 – That the one who is trying to force you has power to 
    cause harm

    2 – That he thinks it most likely that the threat will be 
    carried out if he does not do what is being demanded of him

    3 – That the harm be severe, such as being killed, beaten 
    severely, tied up or imprisoned for a lengthy period. As for being insulted 
    or cursed, this is not compulsion, and neither is taking a small amount of 
    wealth. 

    If the person is of low status, a little harm may not be 
    compulsion in his case, unlike those of high position for whom a little harm 
    may be a humiliation and it is like a severe beating for someone else who is 
    of lower status.
If there is a threat of 
    torturing his child, this is not compulsion, because the harm is being 
    directed at someone else. But it is more likely that this is compulsion, 
    because that is worse for him than taking his wealth; that threat (to take 
    his wealth) is compulsion, so the same applies here. 

    Al-Mughni, 7/292 

    If the harm can be warded off by trimming the beard, then he 
    should not shave it off, rather it is sufficient to trim it, because shaving 
    is worse than trimming. It should be noted that a person should have the 
    need to undertake this journey to that country. But if there is no need for 
    that then it is not permissible to shave his beard for the sake of 
    travelling, because he is not being forced to do that.

How will the people of Paradise who will be punished first in Hell take their books?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The Quran and Sunnah indicate that the people will take their books, which contain the record of their deeds, on the Day of Resurrection. Some will take their books in their right hands and some will take their books in their left hands from behind their backs. 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Then as for him who will be given his Record in his right hand will say: ‘Here! read my Record!
20. ‘Surely, I did believe that I shall meet my Account!’
21. So he shall be in a life, well‑pleasing.

13. Verily, he was among his people in joy!
14. Verily, he thought that he would never come back (to Us)!” [Al-Inshiqaaq 84:7-14]
These verses indicate that the believer who is destined for Paradise will take his book in his right hand, and that the kaafir who is doomed to Hell will take his book in his left hand, from behind his back. 
The evidence that those who take their books in their left hands are the kaafirs is the verses in which Allah says: 
“Verily, he used not to believe in Allah, the Most Great” [Al-Haaqqah 69:33]
“Verily, he thought that he would never come back (to Us)!” [Al-Inshiqaaq 84:14]
i.e., he thought that he would never return to Allah.  
This is also indicated by the verse in which Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“But those who disbelieved in Our Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), they are those on the Left Hand (the dwellers of Hell)” [Al-Balad 90:19]
Al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his Tafseer (20/65): i.e., those who will take their books in their left hands. End quote. 
This is a clear statement that taking the book in the left hand is something that is limited to the kuffaar. 
Undoubtedly the obedient believer who will be saved from punishment, will take his book in his right hand. This is indicated by the context of the verses. The simple reckoning will be merely showing his deeds without discussing them. If a person’s deeds are discussed he will be punished or doomed to Hell, as is narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2172; Muslim, 2876. 
This is also indicated by the report narrated by al-Bukhari (2441), Muslim (2768) and Ibn Maajah (183) from Safwaan ibn Muhriz al-Maazini who said: Whilst I was walking with Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), holding his hand, a man came up to him and said: “What did you hear the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say about al-najwa (the secret conversation that Allah will have with His slaves on the Day of Resurrection)?” He said: “I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: ‘Allah will draw the believer close to Him and He will screen him, then He will say: “Do you admit such and such a sin? Do you admit such and such a sin?” And he will say: “Yes, O Lord.” Then when he has admitted his sins, and thinks that he is doomed, (Allah) will say: “I concealed them for you in the world, and I forgive you for them today.” Then he will be given the book of his good deeds [Ibn Maajah adds: In his right hand]. As for the kaafirs and the hypocrites, they will be called before all people. Those are the ones who told lies about Allah.’” 
As for the sinners among those who believed in Tawheed, who will enter Hell and then be brought forth from it, there is a difference of scholarly opinion concerning them. Some scholars say that they will take their books in their right hands and some say that they will take their books in their left hands.  
Al-Safaareeni (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The kaafir will be given his book in his left hand from behind his back, and the sinful believer will be given his book in his left hand from in front of him, and the obedient believer will be given his book in his right hand from in front of him. Al-Maawirdi was certain that what is well known is that the (Muslim) evildoer who dies without having repented from his evildoing will take his book in his right hand, then he narrated an opinion which suggests that we should not discuss this matter and said: No one says that he will take it in his left hand. 
Yoosuf ibn ‘Umar narrated that the Maalikis differed concerning sinners among those who believe in Tawheed. It was said that they will take their books in their right hands, and it was said that they will take them in their left hands. 
With regard to the view that they will take their books in their right hands, it was said that they will take them before they enter the Fire, and that will be a sign that they will not abide therein forever. And it was said that they will take them after they are brought out of the Fire. And Allah knows best.""(Lawaami’ al-Anwaar al-Bahiyyah, 2/183 )
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: With regard to a believer who sins, will he take his book in his right hand or in his left hand? He replied: He will take it in his right hand.""(Al-As’ilah al-Mulhaqah bi Sharh al-Safaareeniyyah, p. 500). 
It seems – and Allah knows best – that no one will take his book in his left hand except the kaafir, as is apparent from the verses quoted above. 
What the Muslim should do is to strive hard to do acts of obedience and worship, and to do good deeds, so that he will be among those who are given their books in their right hands. May Allah make us among them.

With regard to what you have asked about, the issue of women who are new in Islam speaking to men, the texts of Islam have set out basic guidelines governing the relationship between men and women in a manner that achieves the aims of sharee’ah whilst also protecting Muslim men and women from the things that lead to fitnah. Wise people – even the kuffaar themselves – have attested to the effect that these general guidelines have had in reforming society; this is also to be seen from the history of Islam. 
Islam describes the basis of the relationship between the sexes in the Qur’aan and Sunnah. One of the most important texts is the verse (interpretation of the meaning):  
“O wives of the Prophet! You are not like any other women. If you keep your duty (to Allaah), then be not soft in speech, lest he in whose heart is a disease (of hypocrisy, or evil desire for adultery) should be moved with desire, but speak in an honourable manner”
[al-Ahzaab 33:32]
What is not allowed here is being soft in speech. So the woman should speak in an honourable manner. What this means, as the mufassireen have said, is that a woman should not make her speech soft when she speaks to men. Although this verse is addressed to the wives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), the reason, which is to prevent evil and immoral men from entertaining indecent notions concerning the chaste Muslim women, is a reason that is general in meaning, so all the believing women are included here. Al-Jassaas said concerning this verse: It indicates that this is a ruling which applies to all women: they are forbidden to speak softly to men in a manner that might make them entertain indecent notions concerning them. Ahkaam al-Qur’aan, 5/229. 
Islam has sent out general guidelines in the light of which the details of specific issues may be worked out. We do not need to quote the evidence in detail for each matter. The general principle set out in this verse may cover many of the specific issues, including the situation under discussion here. In the answers to questions no. 1497, 1121, and 6543 you will find a detailed description of the guidelines concerning conversations between men and women; there is no need to repeat them here. 
The basic principle with regard to teaching the rulings of Islam is that the man should be the teacher, because Allaah has given him leadership [?] to act as imam and to issue fatwas and pass judgements, etc. Hence there is nothing wrong with women asking men about the rulings of Islam, as the women used to ask the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about religious matters, especially if the woman who is asking is new in Islam and needs to learn rulings that will make sure her ‘aqeedah (belief) is correct and will increase her conviction and belief in this religion. When a man teaches a woman, that must be done in accordance with the Islamic guidelines referred to. 
It should be noted by our brothers who are conveying the message of Islam to that country – especially the young men among them – that the one who knows himself to be weak and fears that he may fall into the traps of the Shaytaan, namely becoming attracted to the women and being distracted from da’wah, should avoid being in direct contact with women when making da’wah, so long as there are others who are more able to do this task. If there is a need to speak to them, then he should do as little as possible. As for one who thinks that he can be steadfast and is sure of himself, the basic principle is that it is permissible for him to speak to women, but that is subject to conditions, as follows: 
1.Avoiding talking a great deal about matters other than the topic under discussion, or other than calling people to Islam.
2.Not joking or making the voice soft, etc.
3.Not asking about personal matters which have nothing to do with the topic, such as asking the woman’s age etc.
4.If some female daa’iyahs or women who are already Muslim can answer the questions, or if they can be answered through other media such as audiotapes or computer programs, that is better. It is also better if a number of trustworthy people can take on the task of teaching this new Muslim lady as this will make it less likely that a relationship or attachment will develop and she will become more attached to the religion than to the particular person who guided her to the religion.
5.Stopping talking to her immediately if there are any stirrings of attachment or desire in the heart; remembering that Allaah is always watching, because this is a hidden matter which is known to no one except the daa’iyah himself.
With regard to the new Muslim sister, he should explain to her the general evidence that sets out the guidelines for this relationship and the great wisdom behind it. The daa’iyah should be keen to guide her to focus her attachment on Allaah because that will be more effective in making her steadfast and keeping her away from forming an attachment to the men who have called her to Islam. If she does anything that is forbidden in sharee’ah in this regard, such as making her voice soft and so on, he should speak kindly to her so that Islam will become firmly rooted in her heart and she will develop a love for Islam.

    Enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil is one of 
    the greatest duties that Islam enjoins upon Muslims; Allaah has made it the 
    main quality of this ummah and a condition of it being the best of people. 
    Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “You (true believers in Islamic Monotheism, and real 
    followers of Prophet Muhammad and his Sunnah) are the best of peoples ever 
    raised up for mankind; you enjoin Al-Ma‘roof (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and 
    all that Islam has ordained) and forbid Al‑Munkar (polytheism, disbelief and 
    all that Islam has forbidden), and you believe in Allaah”

    [Aal ‘Imraan 3:110] 

    “The believers, men and women, are Awliyaa’ (helpers, 
    supporters, friends, protectors) of one another; they enjoin (on the people) 
    Al‑Ma‘roof (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do), 
    and forbid (people) from Al‑Munkar (i.e. polytheism and disbelief of all 
    kinds, and all that Islam has forbidden); they perform As-Salaah 
    (Iqaamat-as-Salaah), and give the Zakaah, and obey Allaah and His Messenger. 
    Allaah will have His Mercy on them. Surely, Allaah is All-Mighty, All-Wise”

    [al-Tawbah 9:71]
See also question no.
    11403. This is 
    indicative of the high status that Islam gives to enjoining what is good and 
    forbidding what is evil. 

    With regard to the problems of undertaking this duty with 
    regard to those who are older than you, especially your father, you can 
    overcome these problems to a great extent by understanding that this duty 
    must be accompanied by three basic characteristics: knowledge, kindness and 
    patience. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: “These three are essential: 
    knowledge, kindness and patience: knowledge before enjoining or forbidding, 
    kindness when doing so and patience afterwards, as it was narrated that one 
    of the salaf said: No one can enjoin what is good or forbid what is evil 
    unless he understands what he is enjoining or forbidding, and is kind in 
    enjoining and kind in forbidding, and is patience and forbearing when 
    enjoining and when forbidding.” 

    Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 28/137 
In order to solve these 
    problems we should first draw attention to the importance of being patient 
    and forbearing. Do not be too harsh with your father, because he is first of 
    all your father, and because he is older than you. Seek help in doing that 
    by choosing the right time for each conversation, watching out for times 
    when he is in a good mood and is more likely to be influenced and respond. 
    Also seek the help of wise, righteous and sincere people. Before all that it 
    is essential to be sincere towards him in word and deed, and in all your 
    affairs, and to fear that the punishment of his Lord may befall him, and 
    after that be patient in awaiting the decree of your Lord. Whatever happens 
    to you if you do this duty for the sake of Allaah, as Luqmaan the wise said 
    to his son: 
“O my son! 
    Aqim‑is‑Salaah (perform As‑Salaah), enjoin (on people) Al‑Ma‘roof  (Islamic 
    Monotheism and all that is good), and forbid (people) from Al‑Munkar (i.e. 
    disbelief in the Oneness of Allaah, polytheism of all kinds and all that is 
    evil and bad), and bear with patience whatever befalls you. Verily, these 
    are some of the important commandments (ordered by Allaah with no 
    exemption)”

    [Luqmaan 31:17 – interpretation of the meaning]

    You should always remember the Close Friend of the Most 
    Merciful, Ibraaheem, and how he addressed his father when he told him not to 
    associate others with Allaah, which is worse than the things that your 
    father is doing; how he was loving towards him, felt pity for him and was 
    sincere towards him, then he bore his bad response with patience. Allaah 
    says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And mention in the Book 
    (the Qur’aan) Ibraaheem (Abraham). Verily, he was a man of truth, a Prophet.
42. When he said to his 
    father: ‘O my father! Why do you worship that which hears not, sees not and 
    cannot avail you in anything?
43. ‘O my father! 
    Verily, there has come to me of the knowledge that which came not unto you. 
    So follow me, I will guide you to the Straight Path.
44. ‘O my father! 
    Worship not Shaytaan (Satan). Verily, Shaytaan (Satan) has been a rebel 
    against the Most Gracious (Allaah).
45. ‘O my father! 
    Verily, I fear lest a torment from the Most Gracious (Allaah) should 
    overtake you, so that you become a companion of Shaytaan (Satan) (in the 
    Hell‑fire).’ 
46. He (the father) 
    said: ‘Do you reject my gods, O Ibraaheem (Abraham)? If you stop not (this), 
    I will indeed stone you. So get away from me safely (before I punish you).’
47. Ibraaheem (Abraham) 
    said: ‘Peace be on you! I will ask forgiveness of my Lord for you. Verily, 
    He is unto me Ever Most Gracious.
48. ‘And I shall turn 
    away from you and from those whom you invoke besides Allaah. And I shall 
    call upon my Lord and I hope that I shall not be unblest in my invocation to 
    my Lord’”
[Maryam 19:41-48] 

    With regard to the group that you are leading, this is an 
    easier matter, because their closeness in age makes it easier for them to 
    accept advice from you, especially if they know you to be sincere and 
    honest, and that you practise what you preach. This practical implementation 
    of what you are calling them to is one of the most effective means of 
    da’wah, especially if speaking directly will cause them to turn away and be 
    stubborn. 

    With regard to your advice and da’wah being undermined by 
    their parents’ directions, you should avoid blatantly contradicting what 
    they say; rather you should look at the mistakes and teach them the right 
    way. If it is the matter of a sin that they are committing, then teach them 
    to fear disobeying Allaah and to love obeying Him. Instill in their hearts a 
    sense of the greatness of Allaah and the seriousness of His prohibitions, 
    then teach them about what has been narrated concerning these particular 
    sins. This is what you should do if it is the matter of an innovation that 
    you notice them engaging in. First instill in their hearts the love of the 
    Sunnah of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and 
    teach them that this is the practical manifestation of love for the Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). And instill in their 
    hearts a hatred for bid’ah and tell them how it is the way that leads to 
    Hell even though the one who follows it thinks that it is the way that leads 
    to Paradise. Tell them of the advice of the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) to his ummah concerning that, as narrated 
    in the hadeeth of al-‘Irbaad ibn Saariyah (may Allaah be pleased with him) 
    who said: 

    “The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) led us in praying Fajr then he turned to us and delivered an 
    eloquent exhortation that caused our eyes to flow with tears and our hearts 
    to melt. We said (or they said): ‘O Messenger of Allaah, it is as if this 
    exhortation is a farewell, so advise us.’ He said: ‘I advise you to fear 
    Allaah and to listen and obey even if (your leader is) an Abyssinian slave. 
    Those of you who live will see great differences after I am gone, so I urge 
    you to adhere to my Sunnah and the path of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs, and 
    take hold of it firmly. And beware of newly-invented matters, for every 
    newly-invented matter is an innovation and every innovation is a going 
    astray.’” Narrated by Ahmad, 16692 and others; classed as saheeh by 
    al-Albaani in al-Saheehah, 45. 

    So after this general advice we move to addressing the 
    specific bid’ah into which they have fallen. 

    It should be noted that your presence in this group should be 
    for a good purpose; as long as your presence is more likely to do good or to 
    reduce any evils, then join them in their gatherings with this intention. 
    But beware of letting your presence have any negative effect or make you get 
    used to accepting mistakes, or lead you to make similar mistakes. In that 
    case you should leave the place where evil things are happening. Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And it has already been revealed to you in the Book (this 
    Qur’aan) that when you hear the Verses of Allaah being denied and mocked at, 
    then sit not with them, until they engage in a talk other than that; (but if 
    you stayed with them) certainly in that case you would be like them. Surely, 
    Allaah will collect the hypocrites and disbelievers all together in Hell”

    [al-Nisa’ 4:140]
Shaykh Ibn Sa’di (may 
    Allaah have mercy on him) said: Whoever attends a gathering in which Allaah 
    is disobeyed, then he must denounce their action if he is able to, or he 
    must leave if he not able to do that.

    Tafseer Ibn Sa’di, p. 210.

Nothing is more precious to a person – after his own self – than his child. Children are the apples of our eyes. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And those who say: ‘Our Lord! Bestow on us from our wives and our offspring the comfort of our eyes, and make us leaders of the Muttaqoon (the pious)’” [al-Furqaan 25:74]

Undoubtedly the most important thing that is asked of parents is to protect their children and take care of them, to bring them up to worship and obey Allah and to keep them away from disobeying Him. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! Ward off yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell) …” [al-Tahreem 66:6]
Mujaahid and others of the salaf (pious predecessors) said: Advise your families to fear Allah and discipline them. Qataadah said: Tell them to obey Allah and forbid them to disobey Him.
In al-Saheehayn (Bukhari and Muslim) it is narrated from ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Each of you is a shepherd and each of you is responsible for his flock. The ruler who is in charge of the people is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock. A man is the shepherd of his family and is responsible for his flock. A woman is the shepherd of her husband’s household and is responsible for her flock. A servant is the shepherd of his master’s wealth and is responsible for his flock. Each of you is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock.” 
Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2554; Muslim, 1829. 
This hadeeth (narration) indicates that the one who is accountable will be brought to account for any shortcomings in those who are under his authority and under his care. 
The hadeeth states that parents are included in the general principle: “A man is the shepherd of his family and is responsible for his flock. A woman is the shepherd of her husband’s household and is responsible for her flock.”
So the parents are responsible for their children, because they have been commanded to strive to protect them from the Fire and to follow the commands of Allah and to avoid the things that He has forbidden. If the parents do that which has been enjoined upon them, namely giving the children a sound upbringing and not falling short in that, then there is no sin on them if their children go astray. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“and no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another” [al-An’aam 6:164]
If a person understands Islam clearly and has an ounce of common sense, he will understand that if he neglects his duty of guiding and teaching his children, then he is responsible for any deviation that they fall into. The responsibility of families who live in the west towards their children is of another kind that is even greater than that, because they are responsible for throwing the apple of their eyes into the sea bound and tied. It is even worse than that, it is the Fire and torment of Allah. We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound.
In the case of your son, and many others, you should have closed the door to temptation before things got out of control. In Islam there is no such thing as friendship between a man and a woman who is not his mahram (such a close relative that marriage is not permitted to them), especially at this dangerous stage of your son’s life.
 But the important question now is: what to do about it? 
You and his father have to act quickly to get your son away from these sinful relationships and cut off all ties with non-mahram women, even if you know that these relationships have not reached the level of zina (fornication). As we have stated, these relationships are not allowed in Islam in principle.
One of the most important means of getting him away from these haraam (unlawful) relationships may be to protect him by means of marriage. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “O young men, whoever among you can afford to get married, let him do so, and whoever cannot, let him fast, for it will be a shield for him.” Agreed upon. 
What is meant by it being a shield is that it will protect him from falling into sin. 
But you know that keeping young men away from such haraam relationships is no easy matter; it may be almost impossible in the country in which you are living, because the western environment in which the hearts and minds of this generation have grown up is completely contaminated with every kind of temptation and whims and desires, temptations which surround the second and third generations of Muslims there, generations which are losing touch, day after day, with the symbols and laws of Islam, and imbibing instead the values and attitudes of the west, until there is nothing left but the “blessing” of their background? 
I ask you again: Are you serious about following the command of Allah, and do you really fear betraying the trust towards your own soul first of all, then towards your offspring? Do you have the desire to set things straight? Do you have any motive to sacrifice the worldly pleasures and comforts of the west and bring your children back to your own land, or go to a place where your religious commitment will be safer, before it is too late and death comes when you are in this state, then one may say: “‘My Lord! Send me back, so that I may do good in that which I have left behind!’ No! It is but a word that he speaks; and behind them is Barzakh (a barrier) until the Day when they will be resurrected” [al-Mu’minoon 23:99-100]; before we see the outcome of our deeds, i.e., the consequences: “On the Day the event is finally fulfilled (i.e. the Day of Resurrection), those who neglected it before will say: ‘Verily, the Messengers of our Lord did come with the truth, now are there any intercessors for us that they might intercede on our behalf? Or could we be sent back (to the first life of the world) so that we might do (good) deeds other than those (evil) deeds which we used to do?’ Verily, they have lost their ownselves (i.e. destroyed themselves) and that which they used to fabricate (invoking and worshipping others besides Allah) has gone away from them” [al-A’raaf 7:99]. 
Or does this responsibility not deserve such a sacrifice? 
You may say that most of the Muslim lands nowadays are filled with temptations and evils, so we will never find the right atmosphere to raise our children in an Islamic way, so what would be the point of making this move? 
The answer is: Yes, you are right to a great extent, but even if we cannot achieve all the good things, we should do as much as we can; if we cannot ward off all evils we should ward off as much as we can; and some evils are less serious than others. 
All that is needed is to be sincere with oneself. Allah has indeed spoken the truth:  
“Nay! Man will be a witness against himself,
Though he may put forth his excuses (to cover his evil deeds)” [al-Qiyaamah 75:14-15]
