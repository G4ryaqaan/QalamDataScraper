6503,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6503,Eating habits and diet of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him),"What were the diet and eating habits of the Prophet , and his Companians?",,,"Praise be to Allah.

The Prophet’s guidance with regard to food is perfect guidance. It was described by Ibn al-Qayyim as follows:




When he put his hand in the food, he would say, “Bismillaah (in the Name of Allah), and he told people to say this when eating. He said, “When any one of you eats, let him mention the name of Allah. If he forgets to mention the name of Allah at the beginning, let him say Bismillaahi fi awwalihi wa aakhirihi (in the name of Allah at its beginning and at its end).” Saheeh hadeeth, narrated by al-Tirmidhi (1859) and Abu Dawood (3767).


The correct view is that it is obligatory to mention the name of Allah (say Bismillaah) when eating. The ahaadeeth which state this are saheeh and are clear, with no contradictions in them.
When he raised the food to his mouth, he would say, “Al-hamdu Lillaahi hamdan katheeran tayyiban mubaarakan fihi ghayri makfiyyin wa laa muwadda’ wa laa mustaghni ‘anhu Rabbanaa ‘azza wa jall (Allah be praised with an abundant, beautiful, blessed praise. He is the One Who is Sufficient, Who feeds and is never fed, The One Who is longed for, along with that which is with Him, and the One Who is needed. He is Our Lord, may He be glorified). Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5142).
He never criticized food at all. If he liked it, he would eat it, and if he did not like it, he would leave it and not say anything. Narrated by al-Bukhaari (3370) and Muslim (2064).
Or he would say, “I do not feel like eating this.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5076) and Muslim (1946).
Sometimes he would praise the food, as when he asked his family for food, and they said, “We have nothing but vinegar.” He asked for it and started to eat it, saying, “What a good food is vinegar.” Narrated by Muslim (2052)
He used to talk whilst he was eating, as is seen from the report quoted above about vinegar.
And he said to his step-son ‘Umar ibn Abi Salamah when he was eating with him: “Say Bismillaah and eat from that which is in front of you in the dish*.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5061) and Muslim (2022). [* At the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), people used to eat together from one dish, and children would sometimes forget the correct etiquette. - Translator]
He would repeatedly urge his guests to eat, as generous hosts do, and as is seen in the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah, narrated by al-Bukhaari, about the story of drinking milk, where he repeatedly said to him, “Drink!” and he kept telling him to drink until he (the guest) said, “By the One Who sent you with the truth, I have no more room for it!” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (6087).
When he ate with others, he would not leave until he had made du’aa’ for them. He made du’aa in the house of ‘Abd-Allah ibn Bisr, and said: “O Allah, bless for them that which You have provided for them, forgive them and have mercy on them.” Narrated by Muslim (2042).
He commanded people to eat with their right hands and forbade them to eat with their left hands. He said, “The Shaytaan eats with his left hand and drinks with his left hand.” Narrated by Muslim (2020). This implies that eating with the left hand is haraam, and this is the correct view, because the one who eats with his left hand is either a shaytaan (a devil), or he is imitating the Shaytaan.
It was also reported in a saheeh hadeeth that he told a man who was eating with his left hand in his presence, “Eat with your right hand!” The man said, “I cannot.” He said, “May you never be able to!” – and the man never lifted his right hand to his mouth after that. Narrated by Muslim (2021). If it was permissible (to eat with the left hand), he would not have prayed against him for doing so. It was the man’s stubborn arrogance that made him refuse to obey the command, and this is the utmost disobedience which deserved this prayer against him.
He commanded those who complained that they never felt full to eat together and not separately, and to mention the name of Allah (say Bismillaah) over the food so that He might bless it for them.” Narrated by Abu Dawood (3764) and Ibn Maajah (3286).
(See Zaad al-Ma’aad, 2/397-406)
It was also reported that he said, “I do not eat reclining.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5083.
He used to eat using the first three fingers (of his right hand), which is the best way of eating.
See: Zaad al-Ma’aad, 220-222. And Allah knows best.


The Prophet’s guidance regarding diet:




The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to know what he was eating.


He used to eat what was good for him.


He used to eat enough to keep him going, but no so much as to make him fat. Ibn ‘Umar narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The believer eats in one stomach whilst the kaafir eats in seven.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5081) and Muslim (2060).


He taught his ummah something to protect them from diseases caused by eating and drinking. He said: “The son of Adam does not fill any vessel worse than his stomach. It is sufficient for the son of Adam to eat a few mouthfuls, to keep him going. If he must do that (fill his stomach), then let him fill one third with food, one third with drink and one third with air.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (1381), Ibn Maajah (3349); classed as saheeh by al-Albani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah (2265).

6517,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6517,His mother died in kufr – can he pray for her?,Can a muslim pray for his non-mulsim mother who has passed away?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Allaah says in His Book (interpretation of the meaning):
“It is not (proper) for the Prophet and those who believe to ask Allaah’s forgiveness for the Mushrikoon, even though they be of kin, after it has become clear to them that they are the dwellers of the Fire (because they died in a state of disbelief)” [al-Tawbah 9:113]
 Al-Qurtubi said in al-Ahkaam (8/173): “This aayah means that one should cut off ties of close friendship with the kuffaar, whether they are alive or dead. Allaah did not allow the believers to pray for forgiveness for the mushrikeen. Seeking forgiveness for a mushrik is something that is not permitted.”
 Muslim narrated in his Saheeh (916) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “I asked my Lord for permission to pray for forgiveness for my mother, and He did not permit me. I asked Him for permission to visit her grave, and He granted me permission.”
 This hadeeth makes it clear that Allaah did not permit His Prophet, who is the noblest of His creation, to seek forgiveness for his mother after she had died. This is what Allaah forbids in the aayah quoted above, and the hadeeth states this clearly. Al-Shawkaani said in Fath al-Qadeer (2/410): This aayah implies that there are no ties of close friendship with the kuffaar, and that it is haraam to pray for forgiveness for them, or to make du’aa’ for kaafirs in ways that are not permitted.
 If someone were to say that Ibraaheem prayed for his kaafir father, as he said,
“Peace be on you! I will ask forgiveness of my Lord for you. Verily, He is unto me Ever Most Gracious” [Maryam 19:47 – interpretation of the meaning],
the response to that is what Allaah said in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning):
“And Ibraaheem’s (Abraham) invoking (of Allaah) for his father’s forgiveness was only because of a promise he [Ibraaheem] had made to him (his father). But when it became clear to him that he (his father) is an enemy of Allaah, he dissociated himself from him. Verily, Ibraaheem was Awwah (one who invokes Allaah with humility, glorifies Him and remembers Him much) and was forbearing” [al-Tawbah 9:114]

6523,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6523,How Many Angels Are Assigned to Each Person in Islam?,How many angels are there with each Muslim? What are their functions concerning him/her?,"The Angels that accompany each person in this world do the following: 1- they take care of him when he is created, 2- they guard him, 3- they write down his good deeds and bad deeds. So, the number of angels who accompany each person after he is born is four angels.",,"Praise be to Allah.The honourable angels accompany the children of Adam from the day they are formed in their mothers’ wombs until the day when their souls are brought forth from their bodies at the time of death. They also accompany them in their graves and in the Hereafter.
Functions of the Angels that accompany each person in this world
·         They take care of him when he is created.
It was reported from Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah appoints an angel in the womb, who says, `O Lord, a Nutfah (mixed drop of male and female sexual discharges)? O Lord, an `Alaqah (a clot)? O Lord, a Mudghah (lump of chewed flesh)?’ When Allah decrees that it is to be created, (the angel  ) says, `O Lord, male or female? Doomed or blessed? What is his provision? What is his lifespan?’ And that is written in his mother’s womb.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)
·         They guard the son of Adam.
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“It is the same (to Him) whether any of you conceals his speech or declares it openly, whether one is hidden by night or goes forth freely by day.
For him (each person), there are angels in succession, before and behind him. They guard him by the command of Allah.” [Ar-Ra`d 13:10-11]
The commentator on the Quran who had the best understanding of it, Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) explained that the Mu`aqqibat [translated here as “angels in succession”] refers to the angels whom Allah has appointed to guard man from in front and from behind. When the decree of Allah comes – when He decrees that some accident or calamity etc. should befall him – the angels withdraw from him.
Mujahid (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “There is no person who does not have an angel appointed to protect him when he is asleep and when he is awake, from the jinn, men and wild beasts. There is nothing that comes to him but the angels tell it to clear off, except for that which Allah grants permission for it to befall him.”
A man said to `Ali ibn Abu Talib (may Allah be pleased with him): “A group from (the tribe of) Murad wanted to kill you.” `Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) said, “With every man there are two angels who protect him from everything that is not decreed; when the decree comes, they withdraw and do not stand between him and it. A man's decreed lifespan is his protection.”
The “angels in succession” mentioned in the ayah (verse) from Surah Ar-R`ad are what is referred to in another verse (interpretation of the meaning):
“He is the Irresistible (Supreme), over His slaves, and He sends guardians (angels guarding and writing all of one’s good and bad deeds) over you, until when death approaches one of you, Our messengers (angel of death and his assistants) take his soul, and they never neglect their duty.” [Al-An`am 6:61]
The guardians whom Allah sends protect a person until the appointed time (of death) that has been decreed for him comes.
·         The angels who write down good deeds and bad deeds
Every single person has two angels who write down his deeds, both good and bad, minor and major. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“But verily, over you (are appointed angels in charge of mankind) to watch you, honourable writing down (your deeds), They know all that you do.” [Al-Infitar 82:10-12]
“And indeed We have created man, and We know what his own self whispers to him. And We are nearer to him than his jugular vein (by Our Knowledge).
(Remember) that the two receivers (recording angels) receive (each human being), one sitting on the right and one on the left (to note his or her actions).
Not a word does he (or she) utter but there is a watcher by him ready (to record it).” [Qaf 50:16-18]
The angel on the right records good deeds and the angel on the left records bad deeds.
It was reported from Abu Umamah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The angel on the left does not write down anything until six hours have passed after a Muslim does a bad deed. If he regrets it and asks Allah for forgiveness, he casts it aside [does not write it down], otherwise he writes down one bad deed.” (Narrated by At-Tabarani)
Once we know this, the number of angels who accompany the son of Adam after he is born will become clear: four angels.
Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
“The verse (interpretation of the meaning): `For him (each person), there are angels in succession, before and behind him. They guard him by the command of Allah’ [13:10-11] means: each person has angels who take turns in guarding him by night and day, who protect him from evil and from accidents, just as other angels take turns in recording his deeds, good and bad, by night and by day.
Two angels , on the right and the left, record his deeds. The one on the right writes down his good deeds and the one on his left writes down his evil deeds.
Two other angels guard him and protect him, one from behind and one from in front.
So there are four angels by day and four others by night.” [Tafsir Ibn Kathir]

I don’t know whether this is available truly or not.
Please give me an answer.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The correct view according to the majority of Ahl al-Sunnah (mainstream Muslims) is that witchcraft or magic is real and that it can have an effect – if Allah wills and decrees it – on the body of the one against whom it is directed, and it can even kill him.
Imam al-Qurafi said: “Witchcraft is real and the person against whom it is directed could die, or his mood and habits could be changed … This was also the view of al-Shafi’i and Ibn Hanbal…”
The Mu’tazilah and Qadariyyah (two deviant sects) did not agree with this… but that is of no significance. Al-Qurafi and others mentioned that the sahabah (companions) agreed that it (witchcraft) is real, before there emerged anybody who denied this.
Among the evidence of Ahl al-Sunnah is:
The ayah/verse (interpretation of the meaning):
“… but the shayateen (devils) disbelieved, teaching men magic and such things that came down at Babylon to the two angels, Harut and Marut, but neither of these two (angels) taught anyone (such things) till they had said, “We are for trial, so disbelieve not (by learning this magic from us).” And from these (angels) people learn that by which they cause separation between man and his wife, but they could not thus harm anyone except by Allah’s leave. And they learn that which harms them and profits them not.” [2:102]
This ayah clearly indicates what is being asked about here, which is that witchcraft is real and that the practitioner of witchcraft can cause separation between a man and his wife and that he can cause harm to people by his witchcraft – if that is decreed by the universal will of Allah.
The ayah (interpretation of the meaning):
“And from the evil of the witchrafts when they blow in the knots.” [113:4]
‘… the witchcrafts when they blow in the knots,’ refers to witches or female practitioners of witchcraft who tie knots as part of their magic and blow on them. If witchcraft were not real, Allah would not have commanded us to seek refuge from it.
Further proof is to be seen in the fact that witchcraft was directed against the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) by the Jew Labeed ibn al-A’asam. This is a saheeh hadeeth (authentic narration) which was narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim.
Further evidence is to be seen in the real-life experiences of many people, which cannot be overlooked.
Ibn al-Qayyim said: the witchcraft which causes people to be sick or to feel depressed, or which makes them love or hate, exists and is well known to all people. Many people have experienced what it can do to them.” Ibn Qudamah said: “It is well known among people that a man can be separated from his wife (by witchcraft) when he gets married, so that he is unable to have intercourse with her, but when the spell is lifted, then he is able to have intercourse with her. This is so commonly known that it cannot be denied. There are so many reports of witchcraft that it is inconceivable that so many people would agree on a lie.”
There are many ways of protecting oneself against witchcraft:
The best way is to fear Allah, obey His commands, put one's trust in Him, seek refuge with Allah, and start each morning by eating seven dates. All of these were narrated in saheeh ahadeeth (authentic reports).
There are many ways of removing the effects of witchcraft, including:
1) Ruqyah [prayers, supplications], the best of which is supplications from the Quran, then du’as (supplications) narrated in saheeh ahadeeth.
2) Finding the objects used for witchcraft purposes and doing something to neutralize them.
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: the sunnah (prophetic teaching) for treating this sickness – two kinds were transmitted from him:
One of them – which is the best – is to locate and neutralize the object, as it was reported in a saheeh hadeeth that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked his Lord about this, and He directed him to a well where he found a comb, some hairs that had fallen when he combed his hair … . When he removed these things from the well, he felt better, as if he had recovered from an illness. This is the best way of dealing with this problem, and is like removing something bad from the body by expelling it.
3) Cupping, induced vomiting and surgery.
Ibn al-Qayyim said – continuing what he said in the words quoted above: “The second kind is by physically removing the place affected by the witchcraft, because witchcraft has an effect on human nature and the bodily humours, and can affect moods. If its effects are noted in any part of the body and it is possible to remove the bad material, this will be very beneficial.”

Can women who are in a state of major ritual impurity cook or touch things?","Praise be to Allah.Should we bathe immediately after sex?
There is no set time limit within which a woman who is in a state of major ritual impurity has to do Ghusl . It has to do with the performance of prayers and other acts of worship where purity is required. 
Can you delay Ghusl until the time for the next prayer?
There is no harm in delaying Ghusl until the time for the next prayer comes, so long as the prayer before it has been performed in a state of purity. But it is recommended for the Muslim to hasten to do Ghusl so that he will always be in a state of purity, as is the Sunnah, and because the angels do not come near a person who is in a state of major ritual impurity. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There are three things which the angels do not approach: the dead body of a disbeliever, a man who has perfumed himself with saffron (because this is frivolous and foolish behaviour, and is an imitation of women – Qayd al-Qadir, 3/325), and a person who is in a state of major ritual impurity, until he does Ghusl.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 4180; classed as sahih by Al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud, 3522).
If a woman is busy and it is not easy for her to do Ghusl from major ritual impurity straight after intercourse, this does not affect her and she is not impure. It is sufficient for her to do Wudu, to reduce the major ritual impurity and so that the angels will come near her.
Can women who are in a state of major ritual impurity cook or touch things?
The claim that some people make, that it is prohibited for a woman who is in a state of major ritual impurity to touch things and to do certain things , is all innovated (Bid`ah) and false ideas which have no basis in Islam. This false belief is based on false and fabricated Hadiths that have been narrated on this topic. 
Shaykh Ash-Shuqairi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Among these false ideas is the notion that if a woman who is in a state of major ritual impurity kneads dough, it becomes corrupt because of her major impurity, and that the blessing will vanish from everything her hand touches.” (As-Sunan wal Mubtada`at, p. 31)
A similar question was submitted to Al-Lajnah Ad-Da’imah wal Buhuth. (5/318 – Al-Fatawa). The text of their response is as follows:
“Praise be to Allah Alone, and blessings and peace be upon His Messenger and his family and Companions.
Yes, it is permissible for a person – whether a man or a woman – who is in a state of major ritual impurity to touch things such as clothes, plates, pots, etc., before doing Ghusl, because this person is not impure and does not make the things he or she touches impure. 
It was reported in an authentic Hadith that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) was with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) one day; then he withdrew from him, then he came back. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him: “Where were you, O Abu Hurayrah?” He said, “I was in a state of major ritual impurity and I did not want to sit with you when I was not pure.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Subhan Allah, a Muslim does not become impure.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1/333)
And Allah is the Source of strength. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad and his family and Companions and grant them peace.”

Dream interpretation","Praise be to Allah.Significance of dreams in Islam
1- True dreams are a part of prophethood, as it was reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “True dreams are one of the forty-six parts of prophethood.” (al-Bukhari, 6472; Muslim, 4201)
2- Dreams  marked the onset of Revelation. (Al-Bukhari, 3; Muslim, 231)
3- The truthfulness of the dream is related to the sincerity of the dreamer. Those who have the most truthful dreams are those who are the most truthful in speech. (Muslim, 4200)
4- Towards the end of time, hardly any dreams will be untrue. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “That will be because the prophethood and its effects will be so far away in time, so the believers will be given some compensation in the form of dreams which will bring them some good news or will help them to be patient and steadfast in their faith.” (al-Bukhari, 6499; Muslim, 4200)
The same may be said of the miracles which appeared after the time of the Sahabah. This did not happen during their time because they did not need them, due to their strong faith, but the people who came after them needed them (the miracles) because their faith was weak.
Types of dreams in Islam
5- Dreams are of three types : Rahmani (those that come from Allah), nafsani (psychological, they come from within a person) and shaytani (those that come from the Shaytan). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Dreams are of three types: a dream from Allah, a dream which causes distress and which comes from the Shaytan, and a dream which comes from what a person thinks about when he is awake, and he sees it when he is asleep.” (al-Bukhari, 6499; Muslim, 4200)
Dreams of the Prophets 
6- The dreams of the Prophets are wahy (revelation) for they are protected from the Shaytan. The Ummah is agreed upon this. This is why Ibrahim set out to fulfill the command of Allah to sacrifice his son Isma’il when he saw that in a dream; may peace be upon them both.
7- The dreams of people other than the prophets are to be examined in the light of the clear Wahy [i.e., the Quran and Sunnah]. If they are in accordance with the Quran and Sunnah, all well and good; otherwise, they should not be acted upon. This is a very serious matter indeed, for many of the innovators among the Sufis and others have gone astray because of this.
What you should do to have true dreams
8- Whoever wants to have true dreams should strive to speak honestly, eat halal food, adhere to the commandments of shari’ah, avoid that which Allah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) have forbidden, sleep in a state of complete purity facing the Qiblah, and remember Allah until he feels his eyelids drooping. If he does all this, then his dreams can hardly be untrue.
9- The most truthful of dreams are those that are seen at the time of suhoor [just before dawn], for this is the time when Allaah descends and when mercy and forgiveness are close. It is also the time when the devils are quiet, unlike the time of darkness just after sunset, when the devils and devilish souls spread out. (See Madaarij al-Saalikeen, 1/50-52)
Types of dreams according to Ibn Hajar
Al-Hafiz ibn Hajar said:
10- All dreams are either of two types:
1- True dreams: These are the dreams of the prophets and of the righteous people who follow them. They may also happen to other people, but this is very rare, such as the dream of the kafir king which was interpreted for him by Yusuf (peace be upon him). True dreams are those which come true in real life as they were seen in the dream.
2- Mixed up false dreams, which warn of something. These are of different types:
Types of mixed up false dreams
1- Games of the Shaytan to make a person distressed, such as when he sees his head cut off and he is following it, or he sees himself falling into a crisis and cannot find anyone to save him from it, and so on.
2- When he sees some of the angels telling him to do something forbidden, or other things that cannot possibly make sense.
3- When he sees something that happens to him in real life, or he wishes it would happen, and he sees it very realistically in his dream; or he sees what usually happens to him when he is awake or what reflects his mood. These dreams usually speak of the future or the present, rarely of the past. (See Fath al-Bari, 12/352-354)
11- Abu Sa’id al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If any one of you sees a dream that he likes, this is from Allah, so let him praise Allah for it and talk about it to others. If he sees other than that, a dream that he dislikes, this is from the Shaytan, so let him seek refuge with Allah from its evil and not mention it to anyone, for it will not harm him.”
(Narrated by al-Bukhari, 6584, and Muslim, 5862).
Abu Qatadah said: the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Good dreams come from Allah, and (bad) dreams come from Shaytan. Whoever sees something that he dislikes, let him spit to his left three times and seek refuge with Allah from the Shaytan, for it will not harm him.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 6594, and Muslim, 5862). The “spitting” referred to here is a soft, dry spitting with no saliva ejected.
It was reported from Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Alaah be upon him) said: “If any one of you sees a dream that he dislikes, let him spit to his left three times, and seek refuge with Allah from the Shaytan three times, and turn over from the side on which he was sleeping.” (Narrated by Muslim, 5864)
What you should do if you experience good dreams
Ibn Hajar said: to sum up what has been said about good dreams, we may say three things:

A person should praise Allah for the good dream
He should feel happy about it
He should talk about it to those whom he loves but not to those whom he dislikes.

What you should do if you experience bad dreams
To sum up what has been said about bad dreams , we may say four things:

He should seek refuge with Allah from the evil of the dream
He should seek refuge with Allah from the evil of the Shaytan
He should spit to his left three times when he wakes up
He should not mention it to anyone at all.
In al-Bukhari, Bab al-Qayd fi’l-Manam, a fifth thing was narrated from Abu Hurayrah, which is to pray. The wording of the report is: whoever sees something he dislikes (in a dream) should not tell anyone about it; rather he should get up and pray. This was reported as a Mawsul report by Imam Muslim in his Sahih.
Muslim added a sixth thing, which is to turn over from the side on which one was lying.

In conclusion, there are six things to do, the four mentioned above, plus praying two rak’ahs, for example, and turning over from the side on which one was lying to lie on one’s back, for example. (See Fath al-Bari, 12/370)
12- According to a hadith narrated from Abu Razin by al-Tirmidhi, he should not tell anybody about bad dreams except a very close friend who loves him very much, or who is very wise. According to another report, he should not talk about it except to one who is wise or one who is dear to him. According to another report, he should not tell of his dream except to a scholar or one who will give sincere advice. Al-Qadi Abu Bakr ibn al-‘Arabi said: as for the scholar, he will interpret it in a good way for him as much as he can, and the one who will give him sincere advice will teach him something that will be of benefit to him and will help him to do that. The one who is wise is the one who knows how to interpret it and will tell him only that which will help him, otherwise he will keep quiet. The one who is dear, if he knows something good he will say it, and if he does not know or he is in doubt, he will keep quiet. (See Fath al-Bari, 12/369)
Dream interpretation
13- Imam al-Baghawi said:
“Know that the interpretation of dreams falls into various categories. Dreams may be interpreted in the light of the Quran or in the light of the Sunnah, or by means of the proverbs that are current among people, or by names and metaphors, or in terms of opposites.” (Sharh al-Sunnah, 12/220)
He gave examples of this, such as:
1- Interpretation in the light of the Quran: such as a rope meaning a covenant, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And hold fast, all of you together, to the Rope of Allah…” [Al 'Imran 3:103]
2- Interpretation in the light of the Sunnah: such as the crow representing an immoral man (fasiq), because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) called it such.
3- Interpretation by means of proverbs: such as digging a hole meaning a plot, because people say “Whoever digs a hole will fall in it.”
4- Interpretation by means of names: such as seeing a man called Rashid meaning wisdom.
5- Interpretation by means of opposites : such as fear meaning safety, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And He will surely give them in exchange a safe security after their fear” [al-Nur 24:55]
14- As for the book “Interpretation of Dreams” that is attributed to Ibn Sirin, many researchers doubt that it can be attributed to him at all, so we cannot be certain that this book was written by this prominent scholar.

We advise you to be kind and gentle when you deal with him and advise him, because attention must be paid to his condition, just as with all other sick people – whether they are suffering from a disease of the mind or of the body.
You have to do everything you can to stop him from having the drugs and to stop him from meeting the bad friends who are giving or selling him the stuff and thus helping him to do wrong.
You should not give him anything he wants, if you can withhold it from him, until he gives up what he is doing.
We advise you to consult with a specialist doctor who can treat him properly until he gets better and gives up this habit.
If he has young sons or daughters, or brothers and sisters, we suggest that they should also advise him and denounce what he is doing. Perhaps then he will give up because he feels ashamed in front of his children or siblings.
You could describe to him, with the support of other people’s testimonials, how he looks and behaves when he is in an intoxicated state and is out of his mind, so that when he comes back to his senses he will see the evil sin that he has committed.
Do not forget to pray to Allaah to help him to get rid of this habit. Try to make du’aa’ during the last third of the night, and may Allaah show you the way out. We ask Allaah to guide him and to give you patience. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

I do realize all that is truly needed is to pronounce the shahada; but what about the Hajj? How do I articpate in that if I do not have a signed document saying that I am a muslim?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Islam is the relationship between a person and his or her Lord, submission to His commands, humbling oneself before Him, loving and fearing Him, placing one’s hopes in Him, and worshipping Him in the manner He has prescribed. Islam also has certain pillars and duties. The key to all of this is to bear witness that there is no god except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah. With regard to Hajj, it is not a condition for entering Islam, rather it is one of the pillars and duties that come into effect after a person has entered Islam, and it is a duty only for those who are able to do it, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah) to the House (Ka‘bah) is a duty that mankind owes to Allâh, those who can afford the expenses (for one’s conveyance, provision and residence)” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:97]
(See Question # 5261 for details on what constitutes being able to go for Hajj).
Obtaining an official certificate from an Islamic centre as proof of your Islam so that you can use it to get permission to go for Hajj and enter the Holy Places is a means which you must use in order to go for Hajj in the future, but it is not a condition that is necessary for you to become Muslim or start to do the acts of worship such as Salaah (prayer) etc. When a person becomes Muslim he becomes a member of the Muslim Ummah and is connected to all the Muslims who believe in One God by the bonds of Islamic brotherhood which includes friendship and mutual help and support, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“The believers are nothing else than brothers (in Islamic religion)” [al-Hujuraat 49:10]
“The believers, men and women, are Auliya’ (helpers, supporters, friends, protectors) of one another; they enjoin (on the people) Al-Ma‘roof (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do), and forbid (people) from Al-Munkar (i.e. polytheism and disbelief of all kinds, and all that Islam has forbidden); they perform As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as-Salaah), and give the Zakaah, and obey Allaah and His Messenger. Allaah will have His Mercy on them. Surely, Allaah is All-Mighty, All-Wise” [al-Tawbah 9:71]

[al-Qasas 28:68]
One thing concerning which there can be no doubt is that at every moment Allah creates whatsoever He will of people and animals and inanimate objects; that includes newborn children and the young of animals. Every verse in the Quran that mentions Allah’s creation of mankind points towards that which is mentioned in the question. 
Ibn Hazm said: 
Allah did not cease to create after the six days, rather He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“He creates you in the wombs of your mothers, creation after creation”
[al-Zumar 39:6] 
“And indeed We created man (Adam) out of an extract of clay (water and earth).
Thereafter We made him (the offspring of Adam) as a Nutfah (mixed drops of the male and female sexual discharge and lodged it) in a safe lodging (womb of the woman).
Then We made the Nutfah into a clot (a piece of thick coagulated blood), then We made the clot into a little lump of flesh, then We made out of that little lump of flesh bones, then We clothed the bones with flesh, and then We brought it forth as another creation. So Blessed is Allah, the Best of creators”
[al-Mu’minoon 23:12-14]
All of this is something other than those six days. It states clearly that Allah created after those six days and that He continued to create after the creation of this world, and He will continue to create the blessings of the people of Paradise and the torment of the people of Hell forever, without end.

Authenticity of the hadith on saying “Allahumma ajirni min an-nar”","Praise be to Allah.Hadith about saying “Allahumma ajirni mi nan-nar” 
This hadith (prophetic narration) was narrated by al-Imam Ahmad in al-Musnad, 17362, and by Abu Dawud, 5079. The hadith is as follows: 
Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When you pray Fajr, then say before speaking to any of the people, ‘Allahumma ajirni min an-nar (O Allah, protect me from the Fire)’ seven times. Then if you die on that day, Allah will grant you protection from the Fire. And when you pray Maghrib, then say before speaking to any of the people, ‘Allahumma inni as-aluka al-jannah, Allahumma ajirni min an-nar (O Allah, I ask You for Paradise, O Allah, protect me from the Fire)’ seven times. Then if you die that night, Allah will grant you protection from the Fire.” 
Authenticity of the hadith on saying “Allahumma ajirni min an-nar”
Two things may be noted about the hadith. 
1. It does not say that this du’a (supplication) is to be said after ‘Isha (night prayer), as mentioned in the question.
2. The hadith is not sahih (authentic) in its narration from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). See al-Silsilah al-Da’ifah by al-Shaykh al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him), 1624. 
Based on this, it is not mustahabb (desirable) to recite this du’a after Fajr and Maghrib prayers. 
3. Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever asks Allah for Paradise three times, Paradise will say, ‘O Allah, admit him to Paradise.’ Whoever seeks protection from the Fire three times, Hell will say, ‘O Allah, protect him from the Fire.’” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2572; Ibn Majah, 4340. This is a sahih hadith; it was classed as sahih by al-Shaykh al-Albani (may Allah have mercy on him) in Sahih al-Jami’, 6275) 
But there is nothing to state that this should be recited in conjunction with any particular prayer, or at any particular time. 
It is mustahabb for the believer to ask Allah for Paradise a great deal, and to seek protection from Hell a great deal, without saying such words in conjunction with any particular prayer, or at any particular time.

6551,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6551,"When is one counted as having caught up with the prayer in
      jamaa’ah?","I have some problems regarding prayer in jamaa’ah, and hope that you can answer the following questions: If I join the prayer in the last tashahhud, am I considered to have caught up with the prayer in jamaa’ah or not? If I cannot recite al-Faatihah even once during prayer in jamaa’ah, because the imaam reads too fast or because there is no pause in which I can recite it, is there anything wrong with that?
If I reach the mosque and the iqaamah has already been recited, should I join the jamaa’ah when the iqaamah is recited or when the imaam does rukoo’?",,,"Praise be to Allah.According to the correct view, you can only catch
      up with the prayer in jamaa’ah if you catch up with and do a rak’ah
      with the imaam. Merely catching up with the tashahhud or what comes before
      the tashahhud, but not with the rak’ah, does not count as having caught
      up with the prayer in jamaa’ah. I offer you my condolences for your
      great loss if you have caught up with nothing of the prayer except the
      tashahhud. The evidence (daleel) for this is the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah
      (may Allaah be pleased with him), who said that the Prophet 
 (peace
      and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever catches up with a
      rak’ah of the prayer has caught up with the prayer.” (Narrated by
      al-Bukhaari in al-Mawaaqeet, Baab man adraka min al-salaah rak’ah,
      580; Muslim, Kitaab al-masaajid, 607).
This is the correct scholarly view; and it is the
      view of Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him), and
      is the view favoured by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah preserve him).
      It is the view which is supported and strengthened by the evidence.
With regard to reciting al-Faatihah in the
      prayer, this is one of the most important of the arkaan al-salaah
      (pillars or essential parts of the prayer), and the prayer is not valid
      without it, because the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be
      upon him) said: “There is no salaah for the one who does not recite the
      Opening of the Book.” But if a person is praying with the imaam and
      catches up with him during the rukoo’, for example, and he does rukoo’
      without reciting al-Faatihah, this is OK, and the imaam’s recitation
      will count as his recitation, because of the famous hadeeth of Abu Bakrah
      (may Allaah be pleased with him), “May Allaah increase your keenness,
      but do not do this again.”
But if the imaam is clearly rushing, as you say,
      then the essential element of tranquillity and measured pace is not there
      (such as the prayer of some of the Hanafis), so the prayer offered behind
      him is not valid, because he is not qualified to lead it and because one
      of the essential elements of the prayer – that of a measured pace – is
      lacking. This condition is based on the famous hadeeth about the one who
      did not pray properly. But if it is only the case of the imam reciting
      relatively fast and he is able to maintain the required measured pace, in
      this case it is usually possible to recite Soorat al-Faatihah behind him,
      and if you can recite it faster, there is nothing wrong with that. But if
      you are not reciting al-Faatihah for another reason, such as laziness or
      forgetfulness, or because you joined the prayer late, then this does not
      affect your prayer, which is still valid, and the imaam’s recitation
      counts as your recitation.
The Muslim must hasten to prayer as soon as the
      call is given. This is one of the attributes of the believers whose hearts
      are attached to the mosques. Being late and only coming when the iqaamah
      has been given is a sign of weak faith and little desire to do good and be
      obedient. The Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)
      would be attending to his family’s needs, then when Bilaal gave the call
      to prayer, he would stop what he was doing and rush to pray. He 
      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to say, “Let us relax
      with it [the prayer], O Bilaal” and, “My delight has been made in
      prayer.” Whenever something distressed or worried him, he would hasten
      to pray. But those who are lazy and do not come to the mosque until the
      iqaamah has been given or during the prayer or during the tashahhud should
      check and rebuke themselves, for the believer’s deeds will say to him in
      his grave: “By Allaah, I only saw you quick to obey Allaah and slow to
      disobey Him.” But in the case of the munaafiq (hypocrite) and faasiq
      (evildoer), his deeds will say: “By Allaah, I only saw you slow to obey
      Allaah and quick to disobey Him.” (This is a hadeeth narrated by Imaam
      Ahmad. It was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Ahkaam al-Janaa’iz,
      where he also mentioned its isnaads).
Allaah described the munaafiqeen (hypocrites) as
      follows (interpretation of the meaning): “And when they stand up for
      al-salaah (the prayer), they stand with laziness” [al-Nisaa’ 4:142].
      So let people pay attention to the seriousness of this matter, and let
      Muslim women too beware of delaying the prayer until the last moments and
      beware of letting worldly concerns distract them from paying attention to
      the provision of the Hereafter… Whoever gets used to praying regularly
      on time with the jamaa’ah in the mosque when the call (adhaan) is given
      will find that this becomes his main concern and will no longer neglect
      it, in sha Allaah. Whoever tries this will find deep joy, tranquillity and
      peace of heart and mind in the prayer. This will enable him to attain the
      proper sense of humility (khushoo’) when he stands before Allaah. One of
      the favours of Allaah to people is when a year goes by and a person never
      misses a single fard prayer with the jamaa’ah, except for a valid
      excuse. The sincere believer gets very upset if one day he sleeps and
      misses the prayer, or is late for the prayer because of some worldly
      matter, and all of the matters of this world are insignificant and
      fleeting. This is one of the ways in which Allaah helped His slaves to
      obey Him and remain steadfast.
If the iqaamah has been given, the worshipper
      must join the jamaa’ah straight away, even in the Fajr prayer and even
      if the imaam is reciting a lengthy passage, because of the hadeeth of Abu
      Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said that the Prophet 
      (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Once the iqaamah for
      the prayer has been given, there is no prayer except the prescribed
      (obligatory) prayer).” (Narrated by Muslim in Kitaab Salaat
      al-Musaafireen, Baab 710). In this case any other prayer is not valid.
      For example, if a person starts a naafil prayer then the iqaamah is given,
      he has to stop his prayer, then make it up, if he wants to, after the
      (fard) prayer. If he completes the (naafil) prayer, it will not count and
      will be invalid.
Some scholars said that if he is nearing the end
      of his naafil prayer, he can complete it if he knows that he will be able
      to catch up with the first Takbeer (Takbeerat al-Ihraam), because the
      point is to hasten to join the imaam in the prayer.

I am asking this question because I received second hand information concerning a woman's aurah (without the daleel). This person stated that a muslim woman should not wear summer clothes (i.e. tank tops or shorts) in her home around her son (who has not yet gone through puberty but close to it). Additionally, It is the thought of some Muslim husbands that when sisters are together, they should not remove their jilbabs. Please clarify!",,,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-Uthaymeen was asked about this and he replied:
Tight clothing which reveals a womans charms is forbidden, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: There are two types of the people of Hell whom I have not seen: men with whips like the tails of cattle with which they strike the people meaning wrongfully and aggressively and women who are clothed yet naked, and walk with an enticing gait.
The phrase clothed yet naked was interpreted as meaning that they wear short clothes which do not cover that which should be covered of the awrah. It was also interpreted as meaning that they wear light clothes that do not prevent others from seeing the womans skin underneath. And it was interpreted as meaning that they wear tight clothes, so that they are covered and cannot be seen, but their bodily charms can be seen.
On this basis, it is not permitted for a woman to wear these tight clothes, except in front of the one before whom she is permitted to show her awrah, who is the husband for there is no awrah between husband and wife, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
And those who guard their chastity (i.e. private parts, from illegal sexual acts) Except from their wives or (the slaves) that their right hands possess, ¾ for then, they are free from blame [al-Muminoon 23:5-6]
And Aaishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and I used to do ghusl i.e., from janaabah (impurity following intercourse) from one vessel, taking it in turns to dip our hands into the vessel.
So there is no awrah between a man and his wife.
But between a woman and her mahrams, she has to cover her awrah.
It is not permissible to wear tight clothing, either in front of one's mahrams or in front of other women, if it is excessively tight and shows the womans charms.
(Fatawa al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-Uthaymeen, 2/825)
Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan, may Allah preserve him, said:
It is not permissible for a woman to wear short clothes in front of her children and mahrams, or to uncover more than is customary in front of them of that which will not cause any fitnah. She may wear short clothes in front of her husband only.
(Al-Muntaqaa min Fatawa Fadeelat al-Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan, 3/170)
(See: Fatawa al-Marah al-Muslimah, 1/417, 418 compiled by Ashraf Abd al-Maqsood).
Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan also said:
Undoubtedly for a woman to wear something tight that shows her bodily charms is not permitted, except in front of her husband only, but in front of anybody else, it is not permitted, even if it is in the presence of other women, because she could be a bad example to others if they see her dressing like this they may do the same.
Also: a woman is commanded to cover her awrah with loose and concealing clothes in front of everyone, except for her husband. She should cover her awrah in front of women just as she does in front of men, except for what women customarily uncover in front of other women, such as the face, hands and feet, whatever it may be necessary to uncover.
(al-Muntaqaa min Fatawa Fadeelat al-Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan, 3/176, 177).
Al-Mardaawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: It is permissible for a man to see the face, neck, head and calf of women who are his mahrams.

6577,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6577,The Quran is a healing and a mercy to the believers,Tell me more about quran.,,,"Praise be to Allah.The Quran is the word of Allah that was revealed to His Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and is recited as an act of worship.  
This definition of the Quran is comprehensive.  
Our saying “the word of Allah” excludes the words of human beings or others. 
Our saying “revealed to His Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)” excludes anything that was revealed to anyone else, such as the Injeel (Gospel), Tawraat (Torah) and Zaboor (Psalms). 
Our saying “it is recited as an act of worship” excludes the hadeeth qudsi (ahaadeeth in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) narrated words from Allah which are not part of the Quran). 
It brings light and gives certainty, it is the strong rope, it is the path of the righteous. It tells us of those who came before us, Prophets and righteous people, and how those who disobeyed them tasted the punishment of Allah and were humiliated. It contains verses which speak of the miracles of Allah and His power in this great universe. It tells us of the origins of human beings who are created from “despised water” (semen). It contains the basic principles of faith which must be embraced by every humble heart. It contains the rules of sharee’ah which tells us what is permissible and what is forbidden; what is true and what is false. It tells us of the Resurrection and the fate of human beings, either in the Fire in which they will burn and be among those who are humiliated, or in Paradise with its gardens, springs, plants and places of security. 
In it there is healing for men’s hearts, light and illumination for the blind. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And We send down of the Quran that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe (in Islamic Monotheism and act on it), and it increases the Zaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers) nothing but loss” [al-Isra’ 17:82]
Al-Haafiz Ibn Katheer said in his commentary on this verse: 
Here Allah tells us about His Book, which He revealed to His Messenger Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and which is the Quran which “Falsehood cannot come to it from before it or behind it, (it is) sent down by the All-Wise, Worthy of all praise” [Fussilat 42:41- interpretation of the meaning], that it is “a healing and a mercy to those who believe” – i.e., it takes away the diseases in the heart such as doubt, hypocrisy, shirk, deviation and misguidance; the Quran heals all of that. And it is also a mercy which brings about faith, wisdom and the pursuit of and desire for goodness. This is only for those who believe in it and follow it; for such it will be a healing and a mercy. But as for the kaafir and those who wrong themselves thereby, their hearing the Quran only makes them further away (from truth) and increases them in kufr. The problem comes from the kaafir, not from the Quran. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Say: It is for those who believe, a guide and a healing. And as for those who disbelieve, there is heaviness (deafness) in their ears, and it (the Quran) is blindness for them. They are those who are called from a place far away (so they neither listen nor understand)” [Fussilat 41:44]
“And whenever there comes down a Soorah, some of them (hypocrites) say: ‘Which of you has had his Faith increased by it?’ As for those who believe, it has increased their Faith, and they rejoice.
But as for those in whose hearts is a disease (of doubt, disbelief and hypocrisy), it will add suspicion and doubt to their suspicion, disbelief and doubt; and they die while they are disbelievers”
[al-Tawbah 9:124-125]
Qutaadah said, concerning the phrase “And We send down of the Quran that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe”: when the believer hears it he benefits from it, memorizes it and understands it. “and it increases the Zaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers) nothing but loss” means, they do not benefit from it, memorize it or understand it. Allah has made this Quran a healing and a mercy for the believers.""(Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 3/60). 
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O mankind! There has come to you a good advice from your Lord (i.e. the Quran, enjoining all that is good and forbidding all that is evil), and a healing for that which is in your breasts, — a guidance and a mercy (explaining lawful and unlawful things) for the believers” [Yoonus 10:57] 
“And if We had sent this as a Quran in a foreign language (other than Arabic), they would have said: ‘Why are not its verses explained in detail (in our language)? What! (A Book) not in Arabic and (the Messenger) an Arab?’ Say: ‘It is for those who believe, a guide and a healing. And as for those who disbelieve, there is heaviness (deafness) in their ears, and it (the Quran) is blindness for them. They are those who are called from a place far away (so they neither listen nor understand)’” [Fussilat 41:44]
In it is guidance for mankind, away from misguidance and to the truth. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“This is the Book (the Quran), whereof there is no doubt, a guidance to those who are Al-Muttaqoon [the pious” [al-Baqarah 2:2] 
“And thus We have revealed to you (O Muhammad) a Quran in Arabic that you may warn the Mother of the Towns (Makkah) and all around it, and warn (them) of the Day of Assembling of which there is no doubt, when a party will be in Paradise (those who believed in Allah and followed what Allah’s Messenger brought them) and a party in the blazing Fire (Hell) (those who disbelieved in Allah and followed not what Allah’s Messenger brought them)” [al-Shoora 42:9] 
“And thus We have sent to you (O Muhammad) Rooh (a revelation, and a mercy) of Our Command. You knew not what is the Book, nor what is Faith? But We have made it (this Quran) a light wherewith We guide whosoever of Our slaves We will. And verily, you (O Muhammad) are indeed guiding (mankind) to the Straight Path (i.e. Allah’s religion of Islamic Monotheism).
The path of Allah to Whom belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. Verily, all matters at the end go to Allah (for decision)” [al-Shoora 42:52-53]
It contains innumerable benefits, so everyone who seeks happiness in this world and in the Hereafter must refer to it for judgement and follow its commands.  
Imam Ibn Hazm said:
Because the proof and the miracles indicate that the Quran is the covenant of Allah with us, we must believe in it and act in accordance with it. It has come down to us through generations of Muslims narrating it to those who came after them, which leaves no room for doubt that the Quran is the one which is written in the Mus-hafs which we find everywhere. We have to follow its teachings, for it is our reference-point, because we read in it the words (interpretation of the meaning): 
“There is not a moving (living) creature on earth, nor a bird that flies with its two wings, but are communities like you. We have neglected nothing in the Book, then unto their Lord they (all) shall be gathered” [al-An’aam 6:38]
Whatever commands and prohibitions are in the Quran, we must adhere to them.""(Al-Ihkaam, 1/92)

6578,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6578,Dealing With the Temptation to Show Off?,"There is an important issue which I want to know about; what happens is that whenever I do something good, I look for people to appreciate it, in other words to show off., i I know it is not allowed in Islam to show off, but how can we get rid of this feeling? I try to but eventually I get into it.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The one who wants to stop himself showing off has to do the following things to rid himself of this problem:
He should remember that Allah is always watching His slave.
This is the status of ihsaan (perfection in worship) which Jibreel (peace be upon him) mentioned to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), which is that you should worship Allah as if you can see Him, and even though you cannot see Him, He can see you. (Narrated by Muslim, 97).
When a person feels that Allah is always watching him, what other people think will become insignificant, and this will make him respect and fear only Allah.
Seeking the help of Allah to rid himself of the habit of showing off.
Allah says that the believers should say (interpretation of the meaning):
You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything) [al-Faatihah 1:5].
One of the things that will be of benefit in this matter is seeking the help of Allah and calling upon Him. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: O people, beware of this shirk (form of polytheism), for it is more subtle than the footsteps of an ant. The one whom Allah willed should speak said to him, How can we beware of it when it is more subtle than the footsteps of an ant, O Messenger of Allah? He said, Say, Allahumma innaa naoodhu bika min an nushrika bika shayan nalamuhu wa nastaghfiruka limaa laa nalam (O Allah, we seek refuge with You from knowingly associating anything with You, and we seek Your forgiveness for that which we do unknowingly).
(Narrated by Ahmad, 4/403; classed as saheeh (authentic) by Shaykh al-Albani in Saheeh al-Jaami, 3731).
Knowing the effects of showing off and how it will be judged in the Hereafter.
Not knowing this leads to one falling into this sin or persisting in it. One should realize that showing off destroys all one's actions (i.e., cancels out the reward), and that it brings the wrath of Allah. The wise person does not waste his energy in doing things that do not bring any reward, let alone deeds that bring the wrath and anger of Allah.
One of the greatest ahaadeeth (prophetic narrations)concerning the punishment in the Hereafter of those who show off is the following, in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:
When the Day of Resurrection comes, Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, will come down to judge between His slaves, and every nation will be kneeling. The first ones to be called forth will be a man who learned the Quraan by heart, a man who fought for the sake of Allah, and a man who had a lot of wealth. Allah will say to the Quraan-reader, Did I not teach you that which I revealed to My Messenger? He will say, Yes, O Lord. He will say, What did you do with that which I taught you? He will say, I used to read it night and day. Allah will say to him, You have lied, and the angels will say to him, You have lied. Allah will say, Rather you wanted it to be said that So and so is a reader of Quraan, and that is what was said. Then the wealthy man will be brought forth, and Allah will say to him, Did I not give you ample provision so that I did not leave you in need of anybody? He will say, Yes, O Lord. He will say, What did you do with that which I gave you? He will say, I used to uphold the ties of kinship and give in charity. Allah will say to him, You have lied, and the angels will say to him, You have lied. Allah will say, Rather you wanted it to be said that So and so is generous, and that is what was said. Then the one who was killed for the sake of Allah (apparently) will be brought forth and Allah will say to him, Why were you killed? He will say, I was commanded to fight in Jihaad (battle) for Your sake, so I fought until I was killed. Allah will say to him, You have lied, and the angels will say to him, You have lied. Allah will say, You wanted it to be said that So and so was courageous, and that is what was said. Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) struck my knee and said, O Abu Hurayrah, these three are the first of the creation of Allah who will be dragged into the Fire on the Day of Resurrection.
(Narrated and classed as hasan (sound)by al-Tirmidhi, 2382; classed as saheeh by Ibn Hibbaan, 408, and Ibn Khuzaymah, 2482).
Thinking about the punishment in this world for showing off
Just as there will be a punishment in the Hereafter for showing off, so too there is a punishment for it in this world, which is that Allah will expose him and make his bad intentions known to others. This is one of the interpretations of the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him):
Whoever shows off, Allah will expose him. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6134; Muslim; 2986).
Ibn Hajar said: al-Khattaabi said, this means: whoever does something that is not sincerely for the sake of Allah, merely wanting people to see him and hear him, will be punished for that Allah will expose him and make known what he is concealing.
It was said that whoever does something with the intention of gaining status and prestige among people, and does not seek the Face of Allah by doing it, Allah will make him the subject of bad speech among the people in whose eyes he wanted to gain status, and he will have no reward for it in the Hereafter. (Fath al-Baari, 11/336)
Concealing worship and not making a display of it
The further away a person gets from places where his worship can be seen, the safer he is from showing off. Whoever looks for places where people gather, the Shaytaan makes him keen to show off his worship so that they will praise him for it.
The acts of worship which should be hidden are those which are not obligatory or those in which it is not the Sunnah to do them openly, such as Qiyaam al-Layl (night prayer), and giving charity, and the like. This does not apply to calling the Adhaan (call to prayer),praying in congregation and other things which cannot and should not according to shareeah (Islamic law) be hidden.
We ask Allah to make our words and deeds sincere, and to forgive us for what we commit of showing off. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
6581,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6581,Christian lady interested in Islam,"For the last few years, I have been interested in Islam. I have no idea where to begin in further studies. I am a nearly 50 year old woman and am a bit put off by the retractions (seemingly) regarding women. How can I begin to enter the realms of Islam to study? I am open to learning.",,,"Praise be to Allah.How women are dealt with is something that varies from one culture to another. A woman is usually subjected to the teachings, systems and customs of her society, good and bad alike. Many non-Islamic social systems, customs and ways of life are unfair to women. Anyone who studies them will find that the purpose behind them is to make women a means for men’s enjoyment under the banner of freedom. This is something which goes against the true religion and is contrary to the dictates of common sense and wisdom. 
Is it wise or fair that a precious pearl should be shared by a number of people when one of them is able to keep it and look after it?  Is it wise to uncover that which should be hidden merely for a few moments of fleeting pleasure? 
Is it wise to open the door to provocation of desires, free mixing and women uncovering their beauty so that men may commit immoral actions with them, which leads to the spread of disease and large numbers of illegitimate children and the mixing of lineages? Is it wise to burden women with work outside the home which results in them neglecting the house and being crowded together with men and neglecting their children, which they are not able to bear, mentally or physically? 
Look at this simple comparison between the situation of women in Islam and their situation in other systems and religions. 
Firstly: Islam liberated women from enslavement to human beings and to whims and desires; other religions and systems have subjugated women to the devil and to whims and desires. 
Secondly: Islam protects women’s honour and dignity; other religions and systems cheapen their honour and dignity. 
Thirdly: Islam makes spending on women an obligation so that their dignity may be preserved; other religions and systems make women a product to traded in, and they put too much pressure on women to spend on themselves and go out to work. 
Fourthly: Islam protects women when they are young and honours them when they are old; other religions and systems make that a burden on society. 
Fifthly: Islam protects women’s wealth, children and life, and organize her life in a proper manner; other religions and systems neglect all of that.
So firstly: you should read the Book of Allaah (the Qur’aan) and study the commentaries on it (tafseer), such as the Tafseer of Ibn Katheer. [Translator’s note: this is now available in English, published by Darussalam, Riyadh] Then read Saheeh al-Bukhaari and Saheeh Muslim [also available in English]. Listen to Islamic tapes, especially those made by the shaykhs of Ahl al-Sunnah (Sunni shaykhs). 
Secondly: you should go to the nearest Sunni Islamic center to find out what programs they have for teaching women. 
Thirdly: you can benefit from the many Islamic sites on the Internet which present pure Islam and will be able to answer your questions, and you could write to some of the trustworthy Sunni Islamic institutions and ask them to send you books and magazines that will be of use to you. 
Fourthly:  You can get to know some Muslim sisters who could help you and teach you that which will benefit you, because a woman is better able to make another woman understand than a man is. 
Fifthly:  Beware of being deceived by some of those who claim to be Muslims but who in fact have nothing to do with Islam, like the Qadianis (also known as Ahmadis), Shi’ah, Baha’is and Sufis.

6583,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6583,Response to the salam from a Non-Muslim,What should we say when greeted by a non-Muslim with: As-salaamu 'alaykum?,"If a non-Muslim says As-Sam ‘alaykum, you should respond by saying Wa ‘alaykum. If a non-Muslim greets you saying As-salamu ‘alaykum, the majority of scholars said that we have to return the greeting, and this is the correct view.","Can you say salam to a Non-Muslim?


How to reply salam to a Non-Muslim","Praise be to Allah.Can you say salam to a Non-Muslim?
It is not permissible firstly to initiate the greeting of salam to a non-Muslim . The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not initiate the greeting of salam to a Jew or a Christian. ” (Narrated by Muslim, 2167)
How to reply salam to a Non-Muslim
If one of them says As-Sam ‘alaykum meaning, may death be upon you or it is not clear whether they have said salam, then we should respond by saying Wa ‘alaykum (and upon you).
Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: When the Jews greet you, they say As-sam ‘alaykum (may death be upon you), so respond by saying ‘alayk (and also upon you). (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5902; Muslim, 2461)
If a non-Muslim greets us with the correct shar’i greeting (i.e., says As-salamu ‘alaykum clearly), the scholars differed as to whether we have to return the greeting. The majority of scholars said that we do have to return the greeting, and this is the correct view.
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“They differed as to whether it is obligatory to return the greeting . The majority said that it is obligatory and this is the correct view. A group of scholars said that it is not obligatory to return their greeting just as it is not obligatory to return the greeting of those who follow bid’ah. But the correct view is the first one. The difference is that we are commanded to forsake the followers of bid’ah by way of rebuke and to warn others about them, which is not the case with the Ahl al-Dhimmah (Jews and Christians).” (Zad al-Ma'ad, 2/425, 426)
The Muslim who is returning the greeting should respond in the manner prescribed by Shari`ah, giving a similar or better greeting, because of the general meaning of the Ayah (interpretation of the meaning):
When you are greeted with a greeting, greet in return with what is better than it, or (at least) return it equally. [al-Nisa 4:86]
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“If the person is certain that the Dhimmi (Jew or Christian) is clearly saying as-salamu ‘alaykum to him, and he has no doubts about that, should he say wa ‘alayka as-salam or shorten it to wa ‘alayk? What is indicated by the evidence and principles of shari’ah is that he should say wa ‘alayka as-salam, because this is more just, and Allah commands us to be just and to treat others well. This does not contradict any of the hadiths on this topic at all, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded us to shorten the greeting to wa ‘alayk because of the reason mentioned above, which is that they deliberately used to say as-sam ‘alaykum instead of as-salam ‘alaykum, as indicated in the hadith narrated by ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her). He said, “Do you not see that I say wa ‘alaykum when they say as-sam ‘alaykum? Then he said, If the People of the Book greet you with salam, say, Wa ‘alaykum.
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
…And when they come to you, they greet you with a greeting wherewith Allah greets you not, and say within themselves, Why would Allah punish us not for what we say? [al-Mujadilah 58:8]
If this reason is not there, and the Jew or Christian says, Salam ‘alaykum wa rahmat-Allah, then it is only fair to respond in kind.” (Ahkam Ahl al-Dhimmah, 1/425, 426)
The hadith of ‘Aishah was narrated by al-Bukhari (5901) and Muslim (2165)

Qualities to look for in a wife 


How can the Quran be your source of guidance?","Praise be to Allah.Du’a for good spouse
There is not, as far as we know, any du`a specifically for finding a good spouse that has been reported from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), but you can pray to Allah to bless you with a righteous spouse.
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught us Du`a al-Istikharah , which means asking Allah to choose for us what is best for our religious and worldly interests in all matters, religious and worldly. 
This du`a was narrated by Jabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to teach us to seek guidance (istikharah) in all our affairs, just as he would teach us a Surah from the Quran. He said: Whenever any one of you is concerned about a matter, let him pray two rak’ahs of non-obligatory prayer, then let him say: Allahumma inni astakhiruka bi ‘ilmik, wa astaqdiruka bi qudratik, wa asaluka min fadlik al-azim. Fa innaka taqdiru wa la aqdir, wa ta’lamu wa la a’lam, wa anta ‘allamul-ghuyub. Allahumma in kunta ta’lam anna [hadhal-amr] khayrun li fi dini wa ma’ashi wa ‘aqibati amri, faqdurhu li, wa yassirhu li, thumma barik li fih. Wa in kunta ta’lam anna [hadhal-amr] sharrun li fi dini wa ma’ashi wa ‘aqibati amri, fasrifhu ‘anni wasrifni ‘anhu waqdur li al-khayr haythu kan. Thumma ardini bih (O Allah, I seek Your guidance (in making a choice) by virtue of Your knowledge, and I seek ability by virtue of Your power, and I ask You of Your great bounty. You have power, I have none. And You know, I know not. You are the Knower of hidden things. O Allah! If in Your knowledge, (this matter [ and he should mention it here]) is good for my religion, my livelihood and my affairs, immediate and in the distant future, ordain it for me, make it easy for me and bless it for me. And if in Your knowledge (this matter [ and he should mention it here]) is bad for my religion, my livelihood and my affairs, immediate and in the distant future, then turn it away from me, and turn me away from it, and ordain for me the good wherever it may be, and make me pleased with it). (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1109)
Qualities to look for in a husband 
There is nothing which it is more important for both parties to focus on than religious commitment and attitude.
With regard to the husband, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) advised the guardians (walis) of women:
“If there comes to you one whose attitude and commitment to religion pleases you, then marry him (to your female relative), for if you do not do that, there will be much trouble and corruption in the land.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1084; Ibn Majah, 1967)
Qualities to look for in a wife 
With regard to the wife, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) gave the following advice:
“Women are married for four things : wealth, lineage, beauty and religious commitment. Marry the one who is religious, may your hands be rubbed with dust! (i.e., may you prosper).” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 4802; Muslim, 1466).
Al-Hafiz ibn Hajar said: “The meaning is that what is appropriate for the man who is religious and chivalrous is that religion must be the ultimate focus in all things, and especially with regard to the choice of a lifelong companion. So the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded him to seek a religious woman , since religion is his ultimate goal.” (Fath al-Bari, 9/135)
How can the Quran be your source of guidance?
With regard to the second part of your question, about letting the Quran be your guidance :
If you mean using it for divination, like astrology, this is haram. One of the innovated ways in which people do this is to open the Mus-haf at random, and if their gaze falls on a verse which speaks of mercy or reward, they think this means that what they want to do is good! And if they see a verse which speaks of punishment, they think that what they want to do is bad. There is no basis for this in the religion; this is one of the ways in which the shayatin (devils) misguide the believing slaves of Allah.
But if what you mean by letting the Quran be your guidance is following it and acting in accordance with its rulings, this is the way to achieve true happiness, and there is no happiness apart from this, which is adherence to the Quran and Sunnah. This is the only way for mankind to be guided and saved by Allah on the Day of Resurrection. Concerning this Allah says (interpretation of the meanings):
“This is the Book (the Quran), whereof there is no doubt, a guidance to those who are Al-Muttaqun [the pious].” [al-Baqarah 2:2]
“Verily, this Quran guides to that which is most just and right.” [al-Isra 17:9]

6586,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6586,Is Leaving Sunnah a Sin?,"All praise is due to Allah, we ask Him for His guidance and we seek refuge from the evil within ourselves.
As Allah said "" Fas alu ahla ath-thikri in kuntum la ta'lamun"". 
So my  is:
1. Will Allah punish us if we leave the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him)?
Note: Any kind of Sunnah whether it's shaving men's beard or not praying 2 rak`ah before Fajr.","A person will not be punished for not doing things which are Sunnah in the sense of deeds for which the one who does them will be rewarded, but the one who does not do them will not deserve to be punished for that.","What is Sunnah?


Which Sunnah will you be punished if you miss it?","Praise be to Allah.What is Sunnah?
The word Sunnah has two meanings:

The path of guidance, which is the meaning in many hadiths, such as the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): Whoever turns away from my Sunnah has nothing to do with me.
What the scholars of Usul and Fiqh call mustahabb (encouraged), which are deeds for which the one who does them will be rewarded, but the one who does not do them will not deserve to be punished for that. Examples include al-Sunan al-Rawatib (Sunnah prayers which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did regularly), Duha prayer and so on.

Which Sunnah will you be punished if you miss it?
Therefore, a person will not be punished for not doing things which are Sunnah in the second sense. With regard to the first definition, this is not the case, for these are divided into things which are obligatory (wajib) and things which are supererogatory (nafl).
Sunnat al-Fajr and al-Witr are Sunnah Muakkadah, prayer which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) never omitted to do, whether he was travelling or not.
Letting the beard grow is an obligation (wajib); it does not come under the category of Sunnah as defined by the jurists. Whoever shaves his beard is imitating the Majus (Zoroastrians), going against the Fitrah (natural disposition of man), and changing the creation of Allah.
The one who neglects an act that is an obligatory Sunnah will be punished; the one who neglects a mustahabb Sunnah will not be punished, but he is missing out on a great reward and the chance to make up any shortfall in his obligations, because on the Day of Resurrection, any shortfall in his obligations will be made up from his Sunnah actions, if he has any to his credit. Doing Sunnah actions is also a means of maintaining the practice of obligatory actions.
The scholars also use the word Sunnah in contrast to bid’ah (reprehensible innovation) and say Ahl al-Sunnah (the people or followers of Sunnah) to distinguish them from the followers of misguided disbelieving sects such as the Jahmiyyah, or innovators who are not disbelievers, such as the Ash’aris and others. 
The Sunnah in this sense has to be followed . Following the way of Ahl al-Sunnah is obligatory, and whoever departs from their way is doomed.
Imam Malik (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The Sunnah is like the ship of Nuh: whoever boards it will be saved and whoever stays behind will be drowned.”

    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with regard to this matter.
Imaam Muslim said in his Saheeh:
Baab Nikaah al-Mutah wa bayaan annahu ubeeha thumma nusikha
    thumma ubeeha thumma nusikha wastaqarra tahreemuhu ilaa Yawn il-Qiyaamah (Chapter on
    Mutah marriage and the statement that it was permitted, then abrogated, then
    permitted, then abrogated, and this prohibition remains in effect until the Day of
    Resurrection).
From Iyaas ibn Salamah from his father, who said: The Messenger
    of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) gave sanction for contracting
    temporary marriage (mutah) for three nights in the year of Awtaas [after the Battle
    of Humayn in 8 AH], then he forbade it. (2499)
From al-Rabee ibn Sabrah from his father: on the day of the
    Conquest (of Makkah) the Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)
    forbade temporary marriage (mutah) with women. (Saheeh Muslim, 2506)
And also from him (may Allaah be pleased with him): that the Messenger
    of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade mutah and said:
    It is forbidden from this day of yours until the Day of Resurrection, and whoever
    has given anything [as a dowry] should not take it back. (Saheeh Muslim,
    2509).
From Ali ibn Abi Taalib: that the Prophet 
 (peace and blessings
    of Allaah be upon him) forbade temporary marriage to women and the flesh of donkeys at the
    time of Khaybar. This was narrated by al-Tirmidhi, who said: the hadeeth of Ali is
    hasan saheeh and this is what was followed by the scholars among the companions of the
    Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and others this is also the
    view of al-Thawri, Ibn al-Mubaarak, al-Shaafai, Ahmad and Ishaaq. Sunan
    al-Tirmidhi, 1040.
Either this man who has deceived you is an evil Raafidi who is
    following the religion of his community, who permit mutah marriages which are
    forbidden in Islam, or he is a corrupt Muslim who is taking advantage of the matter to
    fulfil his own desires, or he is ignorant and needs to be educated and advised.

6596,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/6596,Do You Have to Wear Hijab in Front of Non-Muslim Women?,I have heard that a kaffir woman isforbidden to look at a muslim woman without her hijab. Is this applicable to my mother-in-inlaw who is an unbeliever?,It is not obligatory to wear Hijab in front of non-Muslim women because they are like all other women according to the more correct of the two scholarly views unless a woman fears that the non-Muslim woman may describe her to her husband or to any other non-mahram man.,,"Praise be to Allah.The scholars differed concerning the ruling on whether Muslim women can take off their Hijab in front of non-Muslim women , because they differed in their interpretation of the verse in Surah An-Nur (interpretation of the meaning):
“… and not to reveal their adornment except to their husbands… or their women…” [An-Nur 24:31]
There are three views concerning the Tafsir of this phrase:

That it means Muslim women;
That it means all women, Muslim and non-Muslim;
That it means Muslim women preferably but this is not binding.

The more correct view – and Allah knows best – is that it is permissible for a Muslim woman to appear (without Hijab) in front of a non-Muslim woman , unless she fears that the woman may describe her to her husband or to any other stranger (non-mahram man). In that case she has to keep her Hijab on in front of that woman. There is no difference between a non-Muslim woman and a corrupt Muslim woman in this case.
Among the evidence that it is permissible to take off Hijab in front of a non-Muslim woman is the Hadith of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) in which she mentions that a Jewish woman came in to see her and said, “May Allah protect you from the torment of the grave…” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 1007; Muslim, 584).
Shaykh `Abd Al-`Aziz ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
“It is not obligatory to wear Hijab in front of them – non-Muslim women – because they are like all other women according to the more correct of the two scholarly views.” (Fatawa Al-Mar’ah Al-Muslimah, 2/582)
What the Muslim woman can uncover in front of a non-Muslim woman is the same as what she can uncover in front of her Mahrams, i.e., the places of adornment or the places of Wudu.
Shaykh Muhammad Salih ibn `Uthaymin said: “In front of her Mahrams she can uncover her face, head, neck, hands, forearms, feet and calves, and she should cover everything else.” (Fatawa Al-Mar’ah Al-Muslimah, 1/417)
And Allah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
