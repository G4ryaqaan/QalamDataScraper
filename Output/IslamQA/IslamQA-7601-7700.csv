7622,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7622,He promised a kaafir that he would go to the church with him,"Is breaking promise with non-muslim permitted by Allah SWT? I happened to
have a conversation with a non-muslim man who is a Christian at my work.
He is about 45 years old and I am 20. I always try to keep myself behave
politely at this new work environment at which I will be working for the
next 5 years at the same place, Insya Allah. Apparently, this man has been
trying to influence me with Christianity in several different ways. First,
he acts in a nice way and a couple days ago invited me to talk about
      Al-Qur'an and Bible. He said that in the Bible, Ibrahim was asked by Sarah
      (his wife) to sleep with their servant to have a baby, Isaac.
      Astaghfirullah! I responded that it was not true! Second, he asked me to
      bring Al-Qur'an. He said the reason was because he heard so many stories
      that are quite similar between Al-Qur'an and Bible. Third, he asked me if
      I would like to go to church sometimes just to see how it looks like when
      people pray. At that moment, I was thinking that there was nothing wrong
      to go to church as long as I do not participate in any ritual ceremony or
      activity. I said, ""Sure..."" and he quickly asked when would be
      the good time for me to go. After I thought for a second, I said,
      ""Why and what is the purpose for me to go to church while I even
      sometimes cannot go to pray at the mosque or musholla due to my
      work?"" I pray at my workplace because there is no mosque or musholla
      nearby my office. He said that it is just to know other people religion
      and not to converting or anything.
      On my way home, I was thinking that this man is slick. He seems a friendly
      guy but behind that tries to get me to his believe to a minor. As a
      muslim, I believe in Allah and He is the one who can help me. Allah knows

7638,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7638,"Helping
      people to buy used cars with ribaa (interest)","I am a Muslim and own a used car dealership in the USA. I am writing you seeking your help in finding what I am going to explain to you is HALAL OR HARAM (FATWA). I sell my cars to people who can’t afford to pay cash up front for the cars they buy.  So I sell my cars with a low down payment and a low weekly payment with no INTEREST (Reba).  The disadvantage to this system is a lot of customers who buy cars from me make a few payments or damage the car and stop paying.  The other disadvantage is waiting a long period of time to get my money back.  All of the dealers in this country are using Financial Institutions to help their customers get loans to buy cars from them and get their money fast.  Here is how it works: 

1.       The customer chooses a car he likes. 

2.       I help him or her fill out an application form in the behalf of the Financial Institution. 

3.       I send or fax the application to the Financial Institution and act as the customer’s agent and also an agent for the Financial Institution. 

4.       When the Financial institution approves the applicant, they send me anywhere between 75 to 90% of my money and charges the customers a monthly payments plus interest (Reba) for the duration of the loan. 

My question is this: Is it HALAL OR HARAM to help people deal with the Financial Institutions to get loans with interest?  Am I held responsible in front of ALLAH by helping people get loans to buy cars with interest ever though I do not get anything back from the Financial Institution or the customer but the 70 to 90% of car’s price? 

Please let me know what the SHARIAA or rules of our DEEN say about this issue.  All I want is to do what ALLAH asks us to do to win his REDA.",,,"Praise be to Allah.This
      way is haraam, because it is pure ribaa. Allaah says (interpretation of
      the meaning):
“Allaah
      has permitted trading and forbidden
      Ribaa” [al-Baqarah 2:275]
This
      is for a number of reasons:
(1)The financial
      institution, as is quite clear from the question, is a ribaa-based
      institution which deals in interest.
(2)The
      method which you describe – whereby the financial institution pays the
      value of the car to the vendor, then takes back its money with interest in
      installments from the purchaser – is no more than a loan with interest.
      It is as if the financial institution is lending the customer an amount of
      money (such as $10,000) on the condition that he will pay interest (such
      as 10%), so the customer repays the financial institution with interest in
      installments (so the amount of $10,000 becomes $11,000). This is ribaa,
      pure and simple, and this is not permitted. This is the ribaa of the
      Jaahiliyyah which was forbidden by Allaah and His Messenger.
Allaah
      says (interpretation of the meaning):
“O
      you who believe! Be afraid of Allaah and give up what remains (due to you)
      from Ribaa (from now onward) if you are (really) believers.And if you do not do it, then take a notice of war from Allaah and
      His Messenger but if you repent, you shall have your capital sums. Deal
      not unjustly (by asking more than your capital sums), and you shall not be
      dealt with unjustly (by receiving less than your capital sums).”
      [al-Baqarah 2:278-279]
“And
      be afraid of the Day when you shall be brought back to Allaah. Then every
      person shall be paid what he earned, and they shall not be dealt with
      unjustly” [al-Baqarah 2:281]
The
      Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:
“All
      the ribaa of the Jaahiliyyah is null and void, but your capital is yours.
      Do not deal unjustly and you will not be dealt with unjustly.” (Narrated
      by Abu Dawood, 2896; Ibn Maajah, 3064).
Al-Qurtubi
      said in his Tafseer:
“The Muslims are agreed, narrating from their
      Prophet 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that imposing the
      condition of repaying something extra in a loan is ribaa, even if it is
      only a handful of animal feed or, as Ibn Mas’ood said, even if it is a
      single grain.”
Shaykh
      al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah said:
“The
      scholars agreed that when the lender imposes the condition of paying back
      something extra on his loan, this is haraam.”
(3)Moreover, the financial institution is also stipulating the
      condition that the loan be repaid within a specific time limit, otherwise
      an additional amount is to be paid. This is also a kind of ribaa.
One
      of the statements issued by the second session of the Islamic Fiqh Council
      was the following:
“Every
      kind of interest or additional payment required in return for delaying
      repayment of a loan when payment falls due and the debtor is unable to
      pay, and interest or additional payments charged on a loan from the outset
      – these are two types of ribaa which is forbidden according to
      sharee’ah.
(4)After knowing the ruling on loans with interest, and knowing how
      strictly this is forbidden by Allaah and His Messenger, it remains for us
      to note that cooperating in ribaa – even if the one who helps does not
      gain anything from that – and making it easy for people in any way,
      shape or form, is haraam according to sharee’ah. Allaah says
      (interpretation of the meaning):
“Help you one another in Al-Birr and
      At-Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one
      another in sin and transgression” [al-Maa’idah 5:2]
It
      was reported that ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allaah be pleased with him)
      said: The Messenger of Allaah 
 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
      him) cursed ten people: the one who consumes ribaa, the one who pays
      ribaa, the one who writes it down, the two who witness it, the one who
      makes it lawful, the one for whom it is made lawful, the one who withholds
      sadaqah (charity), the one who does tattoos and the one for whom tattooing
      is done.” (Narrated by Muslim, 50; al-Tirmidhi, 1038, and others).
The
      Islamic Fiqh Council in its ninth session stated the following:
It is obligatory on all the Muslims to forbid that
      which Allaah forbids of dealing in ribaa, whether accepting it or paying
      it, or cooperating in it in any way, shape or form, lest they incur the
      wrath of Allaah and open themselves to a declaration of war from Allaah
      and His Messenger.
This
      statement was issued by consensus.
On
      the basis of the above, it is not permissible for you to participate in
      initiating or concluding ribaa-based dealings between the purchaser and
      the financial institution. You must look for other, permissible ways in
      which your rights are also protected. Whoever fears Allaah and does his
      duty towards Him, Allaah will make for him a way out and will provide for
      him from sources he could never imagine. Whoever gives up something for
      the sake of Allaah, Allaah will compensate him with something better. May
      Allaah help us and you to do all good. And Allaah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid

However, I am very close to my brother and cannot bear to be separate from him.  
Also my main concern is that both my parents are not in the best of health and I know it will be very difficult to cope without me.  At the present time I cannot mentally accept getting married to anyone.  What can I do?",,,"Praise be to Allah.You have done a good thing by taking care 
          of your brother; this is an act of kindness towards him and towards 
          your parents.  But marriage is a Sunnah, one of the ways of the 
          Prophets, which Allaah has prescribed for His slaves and He has created 
          them with an inclination towards it. I think that you have the choice 
          of a number of solutions, as follows: 
If you can afford to hire 
          someone to take care of your brother, this would be good. Or you could 
          look for some good people who would sponsor all or part of his care. 
          
Or you could get married and have your 
          brother come and live with you, so that you can carry on looking after 
          him. 
If you find someone who agrees to get 
          married on condition that you stay with your parents in order to take 
          care of your brother, and your husband comes to visit you in your house 
          or you go out to visit him sometimes, this may be a good idea. 
If none of these solutions 
          are easy for you, and you feel that delaying marriage will not cause 
          fitnah (temptation) for you, there is no sin on you in that case. But 
          if you fear that you will be subjected to fitnah, then it is better 
          for you to get married, because this will protect your religious commitment, 
          and serving your brother is not an obligation upon you, rather it is

7646,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7646,Some Du’a’s to be recited during prayer,Are there any particular Du’a’s to be recited during the prayer?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Perhaps the questioner is referring to du’a’s during prayer. 
It should be noted that the best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the best of du’a’s are those which are in accordance with the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The Muslim should strive to follow the Prophet’s wording without adding, taking away or changing anything. 
It was narrated that al-Bara’ ibn ‘Aazib said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When you go to your bed, do wudoo’ as for prayer, then lie down on your right side and say: 
Allahumma aslamtu wajhi ilayka wa fawwadtu amri ilayka wa alja’tu zahri ilayka raghbatan wa rahbatan ilayka, la malja’a wa laa manjaa minka illa ilayka. Allahumma aamantu bi kitaabika alladhi anzalta wa nabiyyika alladhi arsalta (O Allah I submit my face to You, and I entrust my affairs to You, and I rely totally on You in hope and in fear of You. Verily there is no refuge nor safe haven from You except with You. O Allah, I believe in Your Book which You have revealed and in Your Prophet whom You have sent).  
Then if you die during the night, you will have died following the fitrah (sound nature of man). Make these the last words that you speak.” 
He said: I repeated it back to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and when I reached the words. “Allahumma aamantu bi kitaabika Allahi anzalta (O Allah, I believe in Your Book which You have revealed),” I said: “Wa rasoolika (And Your Messenger).” He said: “No. Wa nabiyyika alladhi arsalta (and Your Prophet whom You sent).” 
Narrated by al-Bukhari, 224; Muslim, 2710. 
It says in Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi: 
The scholars spoke about the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) correcting him and teaching him the correct wording. Al-Haafiz said: The best that can be said concerning the reason why the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) corrected the one who said Rasool (Messenger) instead of Nabi (Prophet) is that the wording of dhikrs is something that is to be recited as laid down in sharee’ah, and they have special characteristics which cannot be approximated, so they must be memorized with the wording in which they were narrated. This is the view favoured by al-Maazari who said: We should limit ourselves to the exact wording as it was narrated. The reward may be connected to this precise wording; perhaps they were revealed to him in that wording and must be recited in that specific form. End quote. 
There follows a number of du’a’s that were narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), which he used to recite during his prayer. 
1 –After the opening takbeer of the prayer and before starting to recite al-Faatihah. This is called du’a’ al-Istiftaah (opening supplication): 
It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) started to pray, he would remain silent for a while. I said: “May my father and mother be sacrificed for you, O Messenger of Allah. What do you say when you are silent between the takbeer and recitation?” He said: “I say: Allahumma baa’id bayni wa bayna khataayaaya kama baa’adta bayna al-mashriqi wa’l-maghrib. Allahumma naqqini min khataayaaya kama yunaqqa al-thawb al-abyad min al-danas. Allahumma ighsilni min khataayaaya bi’l-thalji wa’l-maa’i wa’l-barad    (O Allah, put a great distance between me and my sins, as great as the distance You have made between the East and the West. O Allah, cleanse me of sin as a white garment is cleansed from filth. O Allah, wash away my sins with snow and water and hail).” 
Narrated by al-Bukhari, 711; Muslim, 598. 
2 – du’a’ al-Qunoot in Witr 
It was narrated that al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught me words to say in Witr: “Allahumma ihdini feeman hadayta wa ‘aafini feeman ‘aafayta wa tawallani feeman tawallayta wa baarik li feema a’tayta, wa qini sharra ma qadayta , fa innaka taqdi wa la yuqda ‘alayk, wa innahu laa yadhillu man waalayta wa laa ya’izzu man ‘aadayta, tabaarakta Rabbana wa ta’aalayt (O Allah, guide me among those whom You have guided, pardon me among those whom You have pardoned, turn to me in friendship among those on whom You have turned in friendship, and bless me in what You have bestowed, and save me from the evil of what You have decreed. For verily You decree and none can influence You; and he is not humiliated whom You have befriended, nor is he honoured who is Your enemy. Blessed are You, O Lord, and Exalted).” 
Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 464; al-Nasaa’i, 1745; Abu Dawood, 1425; Ibn Maajah, 1178. 
This hadith was classed as hasan by al-Tirmidhi and others, and as saheeh by al-Albani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel, 429. 
3 – During bowing and prostration, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to say: “Subhaanak Allahumma Rabbanaa wa bi hamdika Allahumma ighfir li (Glory and praise be to You, O Allah our Lord. O Allah, forgive me).” 
Narrated by al-Bukhari, 761; Muslim, 484, from the hadith of ‘Aa’ishah. 
Saying du’a’ whilst prostrating is the best of du’a’, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The closest that any one of you may be to his Lord is when he is prostrating, so say a lot of du’a’ at that time.” Narrated by Muslim, 482. 
4 – Between the two prostrations, he used to say: “Allahumma ighfir li warhamni wajburni wahdini warzuqni (O Allah, forgive me, have mercy on me, enrich me, guide me and grant me provision).”  
Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 284; Ibn Maajah, 898; classed as saheeh by al-Albani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi. 
5 – After the tashahhud and before the salaam: 
It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When any one of you has finished the last tashahhud, let him seek refuge with Allah from four things and say: Allahumma inni a’oodhu bika min ‘adhaabi jahannam wa min ‘adhaab il-qabri wa min fitnat il-mahyaa wa’l-mamaat wa min sharri fitnat il-maseeh il-dajjaal (O Allah, I seek refuge with You from the torment of Hell and from the torment of the grave and from the trials of life and death and from the evil of the trial of the Dajjaal).” Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1311; Muslim, 588 – this version narrated by Muslim). 
Al-Bukhari (834) and Muslim (2705) narrated from Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq that he said to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Teach me a du’a’ that I may say in my prayer.” He said: “Say: ‘Allahumma inni zalamtu nafsi zulman katheeran wa laa yaghfir ul-dhunoob illa anta, faghfir li maghfiratan min ‘indaka warhamni, innaka anta al-Ghafoor al-Raheem (O Allah, indeed I have wronged myself greatly, and there is none who forgives sins besides You. So grant me forgiveness from You and have mercy on me, for you are the All-Forgiving, Most Merciful).’”  
Muslim (771) narrated a hadith which includes some of the du’a’s that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to recite in his prayer. It was narrated from ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib that when the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stood up to pray, he would say:  
“Wajjahtu wajhiya lilladhi fatara al-samawaati wa’l-ard haneefan musliman wa maa ana min al-mushrikeen.

Wasrif ‘anni sayyi’aha laa yasrifu ‘anni sayyi’aha illa anta. Labbayka wa sa’dayka wa’l-khayra kulluhu fi yadayka wa’l-sharru laysa ilayka, ana bika wa ilayka, tabaarakta wa ta’aalayta, astaghfiruka wa atoobu ilayk… (I have set my face towards the Originator of the heavens and the earth sincerely [in Islam], and I am not among the Mushrikeen. Indeed, my prayer, my sacrifice, my living and my dying are for Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, no partner has He. With this I have been commanded and I am the first of the Muslims (those who submit to Him). O Allah, you are the King and there is no god but You. You are my Lord and I am Your slave. I have wronged myself, and have acknowledged my sins, so forgive all my sins, for no one forgives sins except You. Guide me to the best of attitudes, to which no one can guide except You, and save me from the worst of attitudes, from which no-one can save except You. I am here and happy to serve you. All good is in Your Hands, and evil is not from You. There is no escape or shelter from You except with You. Blessed are You  and exalted. I seek Your forgiveness and repent to You).” 
When he bowed he would say: “Allahumma laka raka’tu wa bika aamantu wa laka aslamtu, khasha’a laka sam’i wa basari wa mukhkhi wa ‘azmi wa ‘asabi (O Allah, to You have I bowed, in You have I believed and to You have I submitted. My hearing, sight, mind, bones and tendons are humbled before You).” 
When he stood up he would say: “Allahumma rabbana laka al-hamd mil’ al-samawaati wa mil’ al-ard wa mil’a ma baynahuma wa mil’a ma shi’ta min shay’in ba’d (O Allah our Lord, to You be praise filling the heavens, filling the earth, filling everything in between and filling whatever else You will besides that). 
When he prostrated he would say: “Allahumma laka sajadtu wa bika aamantu wa laka aslamtu. Sajada wajhi lilladhi khalaqahu wa sawwarahu wa shaqqa sam’ahu wa basarahu, tabaaraka Allahu ahsan al-khaaliqeen (O Allah! For you I have prostrated, in You I have believed and to You I have submitted. My face has prostrated for the One Who created it and shaped it, then brought forth its hearing and vision. Blessed be Allah, the Best of creators).” 
Then the last thing that he said between the tashahhud and the tasleem was: 
“Allahumma ighfir li ma qaddamtu wa ma akhkhartu wa ma asrartu wa ma a’lantu wa ma astraftu wa ma anta a’lamu bihi minni. Anta al-muqaddim wa anta al-mu’akhkhir laa ilaaha illa anta (O Allah! Forgive me what I have done in the past, and what I will do in the future, and what I have concealed, and what I have done openly, and what I have exceeded in, whatever You know about me more than I. You are the One Who brings forward, and You are the One Who puts back, there is no god except You).”

7650,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7650,She did something haraam with her husband’s brother,"My husband travels a lot for his job and is gone most of the time.  When we were newly married he treated my very badly, ignored me, emotionally abused me, sexually abused me (sodomized me).  Over my objections he brought his younger (19 year old) brother to live with us and I was alone with him quite a lot.  We had a brief affair which I am horribly ashamed of and have repented for.  Does my husband share any blame for this affair as he in a way created this situation?  Years later he discovered this affair through prolonged emotional and physical interrogation and pressure.  He justified all he did saying he ""had a right"" to find out about my unfaithfulness.  All I have researched since tells me that he had absolutely no right to dig up the past like this when he had no reason for suspicion or to think that this affair was continuing or would be repeated.",,,"Praise be to Allah.Inna Lillaahi wa inna ilayhi raaji’oon 
    (‘Truly, to Allaah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return’). 
Your husband has fallen into that which the 
    Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) warned us against when he warned men against entering upon (non-mahram) women. It was 
    said to him, “What about the in-law?” He said, “The in-law is death.” The word hamw (in-law) refers to the husband’s brothers and other relatives 
    such as cousins (sons of paternal uncle). What is meant by the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saying “The in-law is 
    death” is that there is more to be feared from him than from anyone else because he is able to reach the woman and be alone with her without 
    anyone denouncing him for that, because no one will find it strange that he enters the house. How often we hear of regrettable incidents that 
    occurred because of the husband’s brothers entering upon their brother’s wife, even cases of adultery and the wife becoming pregnant by the 
    husband’s brother. Allaah is the One Whose help we seek. 
It is not permissible for your husband to 
    seek out the past and try to unearth bad things. Rather he should cover up whatever Allaah has concealed, especially after repentance from such 
    things, because his heart will never be clear again after that, and he will think of everything you do after that as being of that nature. 
It was narrated from 
    ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Avoid 
    these filthy things (sins) that Allaah has forbidden, and whoever does them let him cover himself with the cover of Allaah and repent to Allaah, 
    for whoever tells us about his sin, we will carry out (the punishment ordained by) the Book of Allaah on him.”

    al-Saheehayn, 4/425; al-Bayhaqi, 8/330. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 149. 
It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: A man 
    came to the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when he was in the mosque, and called him, saying, “O Messenger 
    of Allaah, I have committed adultery.” The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) turned away from him. The man came 
    to the side of his face that he had turned away from him and said, “O Messenger of Allaah, I have committed adultery.” The Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) turned away from him again, and the man again came to the side of the Prophet’s face that he had turned away from 
    him and said, “O Messenger of Allaah, I have committed adultery.” When he had testified against himself four times, the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) called him and said, “Are you crazy?” He said, “No, O Messenger of Allaah.” He said, “Are you married?” He said, 
    “Yes, O Messenger of Allaah.” He said, “Take him and stone him to death.” 
Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6430; Muslim, 1691. 
In some reports it says that a man who had 
    become Muslim came to Abu Bakr and told him that he had committed adultery. He said, “Repent to Allaah and cover yourself with the cover of 
    Allaah.” Then he came to ‘Umar likewise. See Fath al-Baari, 12/125.
 Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said: 
From this case we learn that it is mustahabb 
    for anyone who finds himself in a similar situation to repent to Allaah and to conceal his action and not mention that to anyone, as Abu Bakr and 
    ‘Umar indicated to Maa’iz. 
Whoever finds out about any such thing should 
    conceal it because of the things that we have mentioned and should not expose it or refer it to the ruler, as the Messenger of Allaah  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said in this story, “If you had concealed him with your garment [i.e., told him to repent and keep quiet], 
    that would have been far better for you.” Hence al-Shaafa’i confirmed this idea and said: If a person commits a sin and Allaah conceals it, I 
    prefer for him to conceal himself and repent, and I quote the story of Maa’iz with Abu Bakr and ‘Umar as evidence. 
This story shows that it is mustahabb for the 
    one who commits a sin and then regrets it to hasten to repent from it, and not to tell anyone else about it. He should cover himself as Allaah has 
    covered him. If it so happens that he tells someone, it is mustahabb for that person to tell him to repent and conceal that from the people, as 
    happened with Maa’iz and Abu Bakr then ‘Umar. 
Fath al-Baari, 
    12/124, 125 
Based on this: 
The man has no right 
    to seek out information on the past from which his wife has repented, for the reasons outlined above. And the women should not tell her husband of 
    what happened in the past that she has repented from; she should cover herself as Allaah has covered her.

What does islam role says on this. Please answer me ASAP. I am desperate to move out, But I like my husband to be happy with me also.","If a husband wants to make his wife live with her in-laws, such as his mother or sister or daughter from another marriage or another relative, and she refuses to accept that, then he has to provide her with an accommodation of her own.","Husband’s relatives entering upon his wife 


The obligation to provide a dwelling place to the wife","Praise be to Allah.Husband’s relatives entering upon his wife 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) warned against the husband’s relatives who are not Mahrams to the wife entering upon her. 
It was reported from `Uqbah ibn `Amir (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Beware of entering upon women.” A man from among the Ansar said: “O Messenger of Allah, what about the brother-in-law?” he said: “The brother-in-law is death.” (Narrated by Al-Bukhari, 4934 and Muslim, 2172). 
It is not permissible for the wife to be alone with any of her in-laws except those who are very young that there is no fear that they will tempt her or be tempted by her.
The obligation to provide a dwelling place to the wife
The husband must provide his wife with a dwelling place that will conceal her from the eyes of people and protect her from heat and cold, where she can live and settle and be independent. It is sufficient to provide her with what meets her needs, such as a room in good condition with a kitchen and bathroom – unless the wife has stipulated larger accommodation in her marriage contract. Also, he does not have the right to make her eat with any of her in-laws. 
The kind of accommodation provided must be commensurate with what the husband is able to provide and be suitable according to local customs and the social level of the wife.
Ibn Hazm (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
“He has to provide her with accommodation according to his means, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Lodge them (the divorced women) where you dwell, according to your means.” [At-Talaq 65:6]” (Al-Muhalla, 9/253)
Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
“She (the wife) is entitled to accommodation because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Lodge them …” [At-Talaq 65:6]
If it is obligatory to provide lodgings for a divorced wife, then it is even more appropriate that lodgings should be provided for one who is still married. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“… and live with them honourably…” [An-Nisa’ 4:19]. Part of that means providing them with accommodation, because she cannot do without proper accommodation to conceal her from people’s eyes and so that she may go about her business, relax and keep her belongings in order.” (Al-Mughni, 9/237)
Al-Kasani (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
If a husband wants to make her live with a co-wife or her in-laws, such as his mother or sister or daughter from another marriage or another relative, and she refuses to accept that, then he has to provide her with accommodation of her own… But if he lodges her in a room of the house that has a door of its own, this is sufficient for her and she should not ask him for alternative accommodation, because the harm caused by fear for her belongings and not being able to relax is no longer there.” (Bada’i` As-Sana’i`, 4/23)
Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) also said:
“A man does not have the right to make two wives live in the same dwelling without their consent, regardless of whether the house is large or small, because this will cause them harm due to the enmity and jealousy between them. Making them live together will cause conflict and each of them will be able to hear when the husband spends time with (has marital relations with) the other or she will see that. If they both agree (to live together in one house), this is permissible because they have the right to ask for independent accommodation, or they may choose to forgo this right.” (Al-Mughni, 8/137)
He did not mean that it is OK for the husband to have marital relations with one where the other can see and hear that; what he meant was that it is permissible for them to live in one house, where (the husband) can come to each of them on her night in a place in the house where the other cannot see her.
If he can give each wife a part of the house with a bedroom, bathroom and kitchen, this will be sufficient. Similarly, he could give each wife a separate house or apartment.
Al-Haskafi (may Allah have mercy on him) – a Hanafi scholar – said: “Similarly, she is entitled to a place in the house that is free of his family and her family according to their means, as is the case with food and clothing. A separated part of the house with a door of its own and facilities such as a bathroom and kitchen will be sufficient for the intended purpose.”
Ibn `Abidin (may Allah have mercy on him) commented:
“What is meant by “a bathroom and kitchen” is bathroom facilities and a place for cooking that should be within the room or in a place which is not shared by any other family members.” (Ad-Durr Al-Mukhtar, 3/599-600)
What indicates that what is meant by the word “house” [bayt – literally, “house”, translated above as “room”] is a room, is the comment of Al-Kasani (may Allah have mercy on him): If the house has rooms, a room should be allocated to her and given its own door. They said: she does not have the right to ask him for alternative accommodation.” (Bada’i` As-Sana’i`, 4/34)
On this basis, it is permissible for the husband to accommodate you in a room of the house that has its own facilities, so long as there is no temptation, or you being alone with any non-Mahrams who have reached the age of puberty. He does not have the right to force you to work for them in the house or to eat and drink with them. If he is able to provide you with accommodation that is completely separate from his family, that will be better for you, but if his parents are elderly and need him, and they have no one else to serve them and the only way he can serve them is by living with them, then he has to do that.
Finally, we urge you to be patient and to strive to please your husband and to help him to honour and be kind to his family as much as possible until Allah grants you a way out. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.

Can you use the jinn?

Is it haram to talk to the jinn?


Can you see the angels?","Praise be to Allah.Is it possible to talk to the jinn?
It is possible to talk to the jinn , but finding out about unseen matters and what is in people’s hearts is haram. Usually those who use words and phrases of the Quran in order to gain control over the jinn use ways that are not Islamic. 
Can you use the jinn?
Using the jinn is a power that was given only to Sulayman (peace be upon him). Hence when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wanted to tie up a jinni whom he had overcome during his prayer, he remembered the du’a of Sulayman and did not do that.
So you should try to advise these people and if they respond, all well and good; otherwise the safest thing to do is to leave them alone and not speak to them.
Who are Ahl al-Kitab?
Ahl al-Kitab (the People of the Book) are the Jews and Christians.
Is it haram to talk to the jinn?
It is OK to speak with the jinn if this happens without you seeking it, and in fact it is mustahabb to call them to the religion of Allah and to adhere to His Shari`ah, just as you call people. It is not advisable to read books or to recite Quran for this purpose, because the Quran was not revealed for such things; it was revealed to be a light and a guide in the life of the Muslim, so that the Muslim can follow it, obeying its commandments and avoiding that which it forbids.
Can you see the angels?
With regard to the angels , the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and other prophets saw them, and some of the awliya (close friends of Allah) spoke with them. `Imran ibn Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him) said that the angels used to greet him with salam until he started to use branding (cauterization for medical purposes), then they stopped. When he stopped using branding, they started to greet him again.

7660,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7660,Complaining to Husband About Relatives,Is the following backbiting; mother talking about her son to another son or sister / wife talking to husband about her sister/brother and real brothers talking about other real brothers?,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Backbiting (gheebah) is a bad 
    characteristic which Allah and His Messenger have forbidden. Allah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And spy not, neither backbite one 
    another. Would one of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother? You 
    would hate it (so hate backbiting). And fear Allah. Verily, Allah is the One 
    Who forgives and accepts repentance, Most Merciful.” [49:12] 
    

     It was reported from Abu Hurayrah (may 
    Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be 
    upon him) said: 

    “The Muslim is the brother of another 
    Muslim; he does not betray him, lie to him or forsake him. The whole of the 
    Muslim is sacred to his fellow Muslim – his honour, his wealth and his 
    blood. Taqwa (piety) is here (in the heart). It is sufficient evil for a man 
    to despise his brother.” [Muslim, al-Tirmidhi]. 

     It was reported that Anas (may Allah be 
    pleased with him) said: the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah 
    be upon him) said: “When I was taken up into the heavens (the M’iraj), I 
    passed by some people who had nails of copper with which they were 
    scratching their faces and chests. I said, ‘Who are these people, O Jibreel?’ 
    He said, ‘These are the ones who used to eat the flesh of the people and 
    slander their honour.’” [ al-Bukhaari, Abu Dawood]. 

     With regard to the meaning of gheebah 
    (backbiting), it was reported from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah 
    (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do you know what gheebah 
    is?” They said: Allah and His Messenger know best. He said, “(It is) when 
    you mention something about your brother that he does not like.” It was 
    said, What do you think if what I say about my brother is true? He said, “If 
    it is true then you are backbiting against him and if it is not true then 
    you are slandering him.” [Muslim, al-Tirmidhi]. Gheebah means mentioning 
    something about your brother in his absence and saying something that he 
    does not like to have said about him, with the intention of mocking him or 
    making fun of him. 

     But if you say something about him in his 
    absence to someone who can offer him advice so that he will advise him, or 
    you are asking for help from someone who you hope will have an influence on 
    him so that he will stop doing some evil action or sin that he has fallen 
    into, and thus bring him back to the straight path – this is not gheebah. 
    For example, if a wife talks to her husband or her son about another of her 
    sons so that he can advise him, this is not gheebah. 

     Similarly, if you speak about your 
    brother or someone else to his guardian or to someone who is able to stop 
    him from doing wrong – with the intention of voicing a grievance and asking 
    for help, or because he has taken something from you unlawfully and you want 
    to demand your rights from the guardian of the one who took what is 
    rightfully yours, such as when a man complains about his brother to his 
    father  if he has mistreated him or taken something that belongs to him, in 
    order to have his rights restored to him, or complaining to a ruler or judge 
    of unfair treatment – this is not gheebah. 

     Al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) 
    said in his commentary on Saheeh Muslim: 

    “But gheebah (speaking about a person in 
    his absence) is permissible if it is for some legitimate (shar’i/prescribed) 
    purpose, which includes six reasons: 

    The first is complaining about unjust 
    treatment: it is permissible for a person who has been mistreated to 
    complain to the ruler or judge, or other people who have the authority or 
    power to deal with the person who has mistreated him. He can say, so and so 
    mistreated me, or, he did such and such to me. 

    The second is seeking help to change some 
    evil action, and bring a sinner back to the right path: so he may say to the 
    person who he hopes can help: so and so is doing such and such, so try to 
    stop him, and so on. 

    The third is seeking a religious ruling or 
    fatwa: whereby a person may say to the Mufti (scholar): so and so – or my 
    father, or my brother, or my husband – has treated me unjustly by doing such 
    and such; does he have the right to do that? How can I deal with this and 
    protect myself from his mistreatment etc.? This is permissible in cases of 
    need. It is preferable to say in the case of a man or a husband or a father 
    or a son that someone did such and such [i.e., describe it indirectly], but 
    naming names is permissible, because of the hadeeth (report) of Hind who 
    said (to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): Abu Sufyan 
    is a stingy man. 

    The fourth is warning the Muslims against 
    some evil: this may take various forms, such as mentioning the faults of 
    narrators, witnesses and authors. This is permissible by scholarly 
    consensus. Indeed, it is obligatory, in order to protect the sharee’ah 
    (Islamic law). It also includes describing faults when one is consulted 
    [about a person, for a serious reason such as business, marriage, etc.], and 
    speaking up if one sees someone buying faulty goods or a slave who steals or 
    commits zina (adultery) or drinks wine etc. – he should mention that to the 
    would-be purchaser if he does not know about it. This is by way of sincere 
    advice, not to cause harm or offence or corruption. Also, if you see a 
    seeker of knowledge frequently visiting a person who is immoral or who 
    follows innovations, and taking knowledge from him, and you fear that he may 
    be harmed, you must advise him by explaining the situation to him, with the 
    aim of offering sincere advice. If you see a person in a position of 
    authority which he cannot discharge properly because he is not qualified for 
    it or because he is corrupt, you should tell whoever has authority over him 
    and explain what he is really like so that he will not be deceived by him 
    and so that he will discipline him – this is not gheebah, and it is 
    obligatory to put things right. 

    The fifth is if a person is openly 
    committing immoral deeds or following bid’ah (innovation): such as drinking 
    wine, confiscating people’s property unlawfully, collecting extortionate 
    taxes, being in charge of illegal activities etc. It is permissible to speak 
    of what he is doing openly, but it is not permissible to speak of other 
    things except for another reason. 

    The sixth is for the purposes of 
    identification: if a person is known by a nickname such as al-A’amash 
    (rheumy-eyed), al-A’araj (lame), al-Azraq (blue), al-Qaseer (short), al-A’ama 
    (blind), al-Aqta’a (missing a limb) etc., this is permissible for purposes 
    of identification, but it is haram (impermissible) to use such names for the 
    purpose of belittling a person, and if it is possible to identify them by 
    using other words, this is better. And Allah knows best.” 

    But if there is no useful purpose to be 
    served by speaking about a person, or if the aim is to make fun of him or 
    expose him, this is gheebah and is not permitted.

7669,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7669,How should she    deal with a husband who watches pornographic movies and does not give her her rights?,My husband has not been intimate with me for many years. I feel like he doesn't love me anymore. He has had sexual problems even when I first married him and I noticed he watches alot of movies which contain sex and nudity but will never aproach me or even kiss me. I have children and I believe divorce is not the right option. What is the solution? I feel shy to say anything to him about this matter.,,,"Praise be to Allah.Firstly: do not feel too shy to speak to your husband and advise him about these matters, because speaking to him may be more beneficial and make it easier to find a solution. Exhort him and speak to him in an effective manner such as will reach his heart; remind him of the punishment and wrath of Allaah; scare him with the torment of Hell; remind him of the trust and the responsibility he has towards his wife and children, (as in the hadeeth): Each of you is a shepherd and each of you is responsible for his flock; the man is the shepherd of his household and is responsible for those under his care.
One of his rights over you is that you should tell him that what he is doing to you is a sin, and that watching these filthy movies is keeping him away from Allaah and from remembering Him. Perhaps he will relent and pay heed to your words. Keep repeating that to him, with wisdom and paying attention to what is in your best interests. If he does not respond, then seek the help of someone who you think he will listen to, such as knowledgeable and righteous people, relatives, friends or anyone who may have some influence over him.
Secondly:
Try to get him to listen to some effective tapes of khutbahs, speeches and lessons, directly or indirectly, and give him some Islamic books, so that maybe his heart will be opened to the truth.
Thirdly:
If none of this has any effect, then appoint an arbitrator from his family and an arbitrator from your family, who you think will be able, by their involvement, to improve the relationship between you and make him give up the evil things he is involved in. These arbitrators should be righteous people, in accordance with the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning):
If you fear a breach between them twain (the man and his wife), appoint (two) arbitrators, one from his family and the other from hers; if they both wish for peace, Allaah will cause their reconciliation. Indeed Allaah is Ever All-Knower, Well-Acquainted with all things [al-Nisaa 4:35]
If these two arbitrators wish for peace, then we ask Allaah to bring you back together in a good and proper manner and to reconcile you with the best relationship there can be between a husband and wife.
Fourthly:
If the arbitrators cannot achieve a complete reconciliation, then make the following offer to him, if you can be patient and put up with it:
Suggest that he marry another wife, and let you stay with him without any rights as far as the intimate relationship is concerned, on the condition that he gives up his sin and you stay with your children and he spends on you. There is nothing wrong with that, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
And if a woman fears cruelty or desertion on her husbands part, there is no sin on them both if they make terms of peace between themselves; and making peace is better [al-Nisaa 4:128]
One of the meanings of making peace here is that she agrees to forego her right of having him stay with her overnight, in return for her staying married to him.
Aaishah said: When Sawdah bint Zamah grew old, she gave her day to Aaishah, so the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) spent Sawdahs day with her.
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4914; Muslim, 1463).
Sawdah, may Allaah be pleased with her, was one of the wives of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).
If you do not reach an agreement with him, even something of this nature, and you cannot be patient and put up with it, then you should not think about or suggest divorce except after being sure that that the disadvantages of staying with this man outweigh the disadvantages of separating from him. In this case, you should bear in mind the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning):
But if they separate (by divorce), Allaah will provide abundance for everyone of them from His Bounty. And Allaah is Ever All-Sufficient for His creatures needs, All-Wise [al-Nisaa 4:130]
In this difficult situation, you must turn to Allaah and seek His Help and ask for guidance to make the right decision. We remind you again that it is your duty to remind and advise this man in all situations. May Allaah protect you and take care of you.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
7691,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7691,Who      was Ibn ‘Arabi?,"Could you please clarify, who is IBn Rabi? I am getting conflicting views from various sources. Shayhk Muhyi al-Deen Ibn al-'Arabi [may ALLAH be well pleased with him] was not a heretic. He was a man way ahead of his times. Those who couldn't understand his wisdom labeled him heretic but he was far from it. Unless you are a Master of Tassawuf I would ask you to refrain from calling a servant of ALLAH ""deviant"". He was one who reached an extremely high level of understanding. His teachings were Islamically sound but not everyone was prepared for his enlightened wisdom. Even to this very day there are those who, due to their lack of understanding, label him wrongly. Sadly it has always been the case that when people can't understand something they try to destroy and disqualify it out of fear. If you take the time to read his works you will gain a great deal of knowledge from them. It is not good to make a judgement about someone whose understanding of our Deen is lightyears ahead of your own. Do not follow the Wahabbi, Salafi and Saudis who cast doubt and disbelief on those who teach the truth to validate their wicked misguidance. Ibn Arabi never misguided anyone he was simply too advanced for the simpletons of the age to understand. Ibn Taymiyyah did not possess the same level of understanding as Ibn Arabi and therefore he assessment mirrors his lack of understanding. Ibn Taymiyyah was an ant while Ibn Arabi was a giant. It was nothing short of ignorance on Ibn Taymiyyah's part to attempt to formulate an opinion about someone who was lightyears ahead of him in knowledge. Secondly, do not go believing what Ibn Taymiyyah quoted verbatim because whereas Ibn Arabi was true scholar and Shayhk, Ibn Taymiyyah himself was a genuine deviant. Ibn Taymiyyah's fatwas have been the source of a great %100",,,"Praise be to Allah.Who was Ibn ‘Arabi?
He was a prominent Sufi; in fact he was an extreme Sufi. His name was Muhammad ibn ‘Ali ibn Muhammad al-Taa’i al-Andalusi. The scholars have told us about him in response to a question which was put to them. The question was as follows:
What do the imaams of the religion and the guides of the Muslims say about a book which has been circulating among the people, the author of which claims that he wrote it and distributed it to people by permission of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) which was given to him in a dream which he claims to have seen? Most of this book contradicts what Allaah revealed in His Books and is opposed to what His Prophets said.
Among the things that he says in this book are: Adam was called insaan because in relation to the truth (Al-Haqq), he was like the pupil [insaan]of the eye, the part that can see.
Elsewhere he said: Al-Haqq which is transcendent is the physical creation which you can see.
Concerning the people of Nooh he said: if they had turned away from their worship of [their idols] Wudd, Siwaa’, Yaghooth and Ya’ooq, they would have lost more of Al-Haqq.
Then he said: Every object of worship is a manifestation of Al-Haqq. Those who know it, know it, and those who do not know it, do not know it. The one who has knowledge knows what he is worshipping and in what image the object of his worship is manifested. These many and varied manifestations are like the limbs of a physical image.
Then he said concerning the people of Hood: They reached a true state of closeness (to Allaah) and were no longer remote. The heat of Hell no longer affected them and they gained the blessing of closeness to Allaah because they deserved it. They were not given this delicious experience as a favour, but because they deserved it as a result of the essence of their deeds, for they were on a straight path.
Then he denied the idea of the warning against those of mankind against whom the word of punishment is justified.
Should the one who believes in what he says be denounced as a kaafir, or should we accept what he says, or what? If the person who listens to him is an adult of sound mind, and does not denounce him by speaking or in his heart, is he a sinner, or what?
Please explain to us clearly and with proof, as Allaah has taken the covenant from the scholars on that basis, for negligence [on the part of the scholars] causes a great deal of confusion to the ignorant.
(‘Aqeedah Ibn ‘Arabi wa Hayaatuhu by Taqiy al-Deen al-Faasi, p. 15, 16).
(The author) mentioned the response of some of the scholars:
Al-Qaadi Badr al-Deen ibn Jamaa’ah said:
The passages quoted, and other similar parts of this book, are bid’ah and misguidance, evil and ignorance. The religiously-committed Muslim would not pay any heed to them or bother to read the book to find out more.
Then he said:
The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) could never give permission in a dream for something which goes against and contradicts Islam; on the contrary, this is from the evil insinuations or whispers of the Shaytaan and a trap whereby the Shaytaan is playing with him and tempting him.
His words about Adam, that he is the pupil of the eye, and his likening Allaah to His creation, and his remark that ‘Al-Haqq which is transcendent is the physical creation which you can see’ – if by ‘Al-Haqq’ he is referring to the Lord of the Worlds – is a clear statement of anthropomorphism [likening Allaah to His creation] and he has taken this notion to extremes.
With regard to his denial of what has been narrated in the Qur’aan and Sunnah concerning the warning: this makes him a kaafir in the view of the scholars of the followers of Tawheed.
His comments about the people of Nooh and of Hood is vain and false talk which deserves to be rejected. The best way of dealing with that is to destroy this and all other similar passages of his book, for it is no more than fancy words, an expression of baseless ideas and an attempt to introduce into the religion ideas that do not belong to it. The ruling on this is that it should be rejected and ignored. (Ibid., p. 29, 30).
Khateeb al-Qal’ah Shaykh Shams al-Deen Muhammad ibn Yoosuf al-Jazari al-Shaafa’i said:
His comment about Adam being called insaan is anthropomorphism [likening Allaah to His creation] and is a lie and falsehood. His belief that the idol-worship of the people of Nooh was valid is kufr. Anyone who says such a thing cannot be approved of. His comment that ‘Al-Haqq which is transcendent is the physical creation which you can see’ is false and contradictory, and it is also kufr. His comment that the people of Hood had reached a true state of closeness (to Allaah) is a lie against Allaah, and by saying this, he has rejected what Allaah said about them. His remark that they were no longer remote and that Hell became a blessing and a joy for them is a lie and a rejection of everything that was revealed to the Prophets; the truth of the matter is what Allaah said about that, that they (the people of Hood) will abide in the torment forever.
Concerning those who believe what he says – and he knows what he said – the same ruling applies to them as to him: that they are misguided kaafirs, if they have knowledge. If they do not have knowledge, then the person who says that out of ignorance should be told the truth and taught about it, and should be stopped if possible.
His denial of the warning to all people is a lie and a rejection of the consensus (ijmaa’) of the Muslims. No doubt Allaah will bring about the punishment. Islam offers definitive evidence that a group of sinners from among the believers will be punished, and the one who denies that is regarded as a kaafir. May Allaah protect us from wrong belief and denying the Resurrection. (Ibid., p. 31, 32).
Ibn Taymiyah said:
The Muslims, Christians and Jews all know something which is a basic principle of the Muslims’ religion: that whoever says of any human being that he is a part of God is a kaafir, he is regarded as a disbeliever by all these religions. Even the Christians do not say this, although their belief is a major form of kufr; no one says that the essence of creation is part of the Creator, or that the Creator is the creation, or that Al-Haqq which is transcendent is the physical creation which you can see.
Similarly, his remark that if the Mushrikeen turn away from idol-worship, they will have turned away from Al-Haqq to the extent that they have abandoned idol-worship, is obviously kufr according to the basic principle that is common to all the religions. For the religions have agreed that all the Prophets forbade idol-worship and regarded as disbelievers those who did that; the believer cannot be a believer unless he disavows himself of worshipping idols and of everything that is worshipped instead of Allaah. As Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning);
“Indeed there has been an excellent example for you in Ibraaheem (Abraham) and those with him, when they said to their people: ‘Verily, we are free from you and whatever you worship besides Allaah, we have rejected you, and there has started between us and you, hostility and hatred for ever until you believe in Allaah Alone’” [al-Mumtahanah 60:4]
-- and he quoted other aayaat as proof -- then he said:
Whoever says that if the idol-worshippers give up their idols, they will have turned away from Al-Haqq to the extent that they have abandoned idol-worship, is an even worse kaafir than the Jews and Christians, and the one who does not regard them as kaafirs is an even worse kaafir than the Jews and Christians, for the Jews and Christians regard idol-worshippers as disbelievers, so how about one who says that the one who gives up idol-worship has turned away from Al-Haqq to the extent that he has abandoned idol-worship?!Let alone the fact that he says, The one who has knowledge knows what he is worshipping and in what image the object of his worship is manifested. These many and varied forms are like the limbs of a physical image and the energy in a spiritual image; nothing but Allaah is being worshipped in everything that is worshipped. He is an even greater kaafir than the worshippers of idols, for they only take them as intercessors and mediators, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“ [The Mushrikeen say] ‘We worship them only that they may bring us near to Allaah’” [al-Zumar 39:3]
“Have they taken (others) as intercessors besides Allaah? Say: “Even if they have power over nothing whatever and have no intelligence?” [al-Zumar 39:43]
They acknowledged that Allaah is the Creator of the heavens and the earth, and the Creator of the idols, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And verily, if you ask them: ‘Who created the heavens and the earth?’ Surely, they will say: ‘Allaah (has created them)’” [al-Zumar 39:38] (Ibid., 21-23)
Shaykh al-Islam also said:
When the faqeeh Abu Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Salaam came to Cairo and they asked him about Ibn ‘Arabi, he said:
He is a vile and evil shaykh who says that the world is eternal and does not see anything haraam in any sexual relationship.
He mentioned the belief that the world is eternal because this is what [Ibn ‘Arabi] believed, but this is well-known form of kufr and the faqeeh Abu Muhammad denounced him as a kaafir because of this. At that time Ibn ‘Arabi had not yet said that the universe was God or the universe was the image and essence of God. This is a greater form of kufr because those who say that the universe is eternal still believe that there had to be Someone Who brought it into existence, that from the One Who must exist comes that which may exist. Those shaykhs who met him [Ibn ‘Arabi] said that he was a liar and a fabricator, and that in his books such as al-Futoohaat al-Makkiyyah etc. there were lies which could not be concealed from any intelligent person.
Then he said: 
I have not even mentioned one-tenth of what they mentioned about kufr, but people who do not know about them have been deceived by these ideas, just as they were deceived by the Baatini Qaraamitah when they claimed to be descendents of Faatimah and said that they belonged to the Shee’ah, so the Shee’ah began to like them without knowing of their hidden kufr. So the person who is attracted to them is one of two things: either he is a heretic and hypocrite, or he is misguided and ignorant. With regard to these pantheists (ittihaadiyoon), their leaders are the leaders of kufr and must be executed, and their repentance cannot be accepted if they are seized before they repent, for they are among the greatest heretics, those who make an outward display of being Muslim whilst concealing kufr in their hearts, those who conceal their beliefs and their opposition to Islam. Everyone who follows them, who defends them, who praises them, who admires their books, who is known to help them, who does not like to speak against them or who makes excuses for them by saying that we do not know exactly what these statements mean, who says ‘How can we be sure that he wrote this book?’ and other excuses which no one but an ignorant person or a hypocrite would come up with, must be punished.
Indeed, it is obligatory to punish everyone who knows about them but does not help to resist them, because campaigning against these people is one of the most serious duties, for they have corrupted the minds and religious belief of many shaykhs, scholars, kings and princes, and they are spreading corruption throughout the world, preventing people from following the path of Allaah. The harm that they cause to the religion is greater than that done by those who damage the worldly interests of the Muslims but leave their religion alone, such as bandits on the highways and the Tatars (Mongols) who took their wealth but left their religion alone. Those who do not know them should not underestimate the danger they pose. Their own misguidance and the extent to which they misguide others defies description.
Then he said:
Whoever thinks well of them and claims not to know how they really are should be informed about them. If he does not then turn his back on them and denounce them, then he should be classed as one of them.
Whoever says that their words could be interpreted in such a way that it does not contradict sharee’ah is one of their leaders and imaams. If he is intelligent, he should know what they really are. But if he believes in it and behaves like this openly and in secret, then he is a worse kaafir than the Christians.
(Ibid., p. 25-28 – adapted and abbreviated)
Ibn Hajar said:
Some confusing words of Ibn ‘Arabi were mentioned to our master Shaykh al-Islam Siraaj al-Deen al-Balqeeni, and he was asked about Ibn ‘Arabi. Our Shaykh al-Balqeeni said: he is a kaafir.
(Ibid., p. 39).
Ibn Khaldoon said:
Among these Sufis are: Ibn ‘Arabi, Ibn Saba’een, Ibn Barrajaan and their followers who follow their path and their religion. They have many books in circulation that are filled with blatant kufr and repugnant bid’ahs, trying to interpret clear texts in very far-fetched and repugnant ways, such that the reader is astounded that anyone could attribute such things to Islam.
(Ibid., p. 41).
Al-Subki said:
These later Sufis, such as Ibn ‘Arabi and his followers, are misguided and ignorant and beyond the pale of Islam; those among them who have knowledge are even worse.
(Ibid., p. 55).
Abu Zar’ah ibn al-Haafiz al-‘Iraaqi said:
Undoubtedly the famous book Al-Fusoos contains blatant kufr, as does al-Futoohaat al-Makkiyyah. If it is true that he wrote this and continued to believe in it until he died, then he is a kaafir who is doomed to eternity in Hell, no doubt about it.
(Ibid., p. 60).
So how can any sane person say that these brilliant scholars did not understand Ibn ‘Arabi? If they did not understand him, who can?
An incident from which we learn a lesson:
Al-Faasi said:
I heard our companion al-Haafiz al-Hujjah al-Qaadi Shihaab al-Deen Ahmad ibn ‘Ali ibn Hajar al-Shaafa’i say: there were many disputes about Ibn ‘Arabi between me and one of those who like Ibn ‘Arabi, until I insulted him because of the bad things that he had said, but that did not make the man change his mind. He threatened to complain about me to the Sultaan in Egypt with regard to a matter that was different from that which we were arguing about, just to cause trouble for me. I said to him: the Sultaan has nothing to do with this! Come, let us make Mubaahalah [call our sons, our wives and ourselves and pray and invoke the Curse of Allaah upon those who lie – cf. Aal ‘Imraan 3:61]. It is very rare, when people make Mubaahalah and one of them is lying, for that one to go unpunished. So he said to me, ‘Bismillaah’ [i.e, he agreed]. And I said to him: ‘Say: O Allaah, if Ibn ‘Arabi is misguided, then curse me with Your Curse’ – so he said that. Then I said, O Allaah, if Ibn ‘Arabi is rightly-guided, then curse me with Your Curse. Then we parted. Then we met in a park in Egypt on a moonlit night, and he said to us, Something soft touched my leg, look! So we looked but we did not see anything. Then he checked his eyes and he could not see anything (i.e., Allaah had afflicted him with blindness).
This is the meaning of what Al-Haafiz Shihaab al-Deen ibn Hajar al-‘Asqallaani told me.
(Ibid., p. 75, 76).
This is how this man has misguided and deceived those who are seeking the truth and who want to follow the path of right guidance. He is a heretic who was not ahead of his time in any way except in misguidance and kufr. He does not possess any light or wisdom; on the contrary he is in the depths of darkness and ignorance.
We have quoted to you the words of scholars other than Ibn Taymiyah, to point out the kufr of Ibn ‘Arabi, so that you will not think that Ibn Taymiyah was the only one who denounced him as a kaafir. 
In response to your bad manners towards Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and your claim that he came years after Ibn ‘Arabi, we say: you came many more years after Ibn Taymiyah than the number of years between him and Ibn ‘Arabi, so you of all people should keep quiet about him.
It is not right to speak in such an ill-mannered way about a Shaykh such as Ibn Taymiyah, whose knowledge has spread all over the world. How can a man such as you dare to describe him as an ant?
Who are you to describe the Shaykh of shaykhs and the Shaykh of Islam as an ant? Do you not fear that you will have to stand before Allaah and be questioned as to why you were so ill-mannered towards the scholars?
We ask you by Allaah, besides Whom there is no other god, can a person who says that the creation is a part of the Creator be a Muslim?

      you did was not haraam and was not a sin; in fact it was obligatory

“… and if anyone saved a life, it would
      be as if he saved the life of all mankind …” (al-Maa’idah 5:32)
 It was reported from Ibn
      ‘Abbaas, from Murrah al-Hamadaani, from ‘Abd-Allaah and from a number

      the person whose life was saved.” (Tafseer

      person whose life is protected in sharee’ah is obligatory (waajib) on

7699,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/7699,Is It Haram to Miss Jumu’ah?,What is the punishment of not going to Jumu’ah prayer? Can you please back up the answer with a hadith?,"It is haram to miss Jumu’ah prayer. If you do not attend Jumu’ah without a valid reason, you will be committing a major sin. Whoever does not attend three Jumu`ahs (in a row) out of negligence has a seal placed over his heart.",,"Praise be to Allah.If a person for whom Jumu`ah is obligatory does not attend and does not have a valid excuse, this is a major sin. Whoever does not attend three Jumu`ahs (in a row) out of negligence has a seal placed over his heart and is regarded as one of the negligent/heedless.
Muslim narrated in his Sahih from Abu Hurayrah and Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both), that they heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon them) say from his pulpit: “People should definitely stop neglecting Jumu`ah , or else Allah will most certainly seal their hearts and they will most certainly be among the negligent.”
According to another hadith: “Whoever neglects three Jumu`ahs (in a row) out of negligence will have a seal placed upon his heart.” (Abu Dawud 1052, at-Tirmidhi 500, an-Nasai 1369) 
This is a spiritual punishment, which is more severe than a physical punishment such as imprisonment or flogging. The Muslim ruler should punish those who fail to attend Jumu`ah prayers with no excuse, as a deterrent. 
Let each Muslim fear Allah and not miss performing one of the obligatory duties enjoined by Him, lest he expose himself to the punishment of Allah; let him adhere to that which Allah has made obligatory so that he may earn the reward of Allah. And Allah bestows His Bounty upon whomsoever He wills.
