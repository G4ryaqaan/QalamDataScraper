13179,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13179,Ruling on breaking one’s fast in Ramadan because of exams,"If the exams for high school graduation are held in Ramadan, is it permissible for a student to break his fast in Ramadan so that he will be able to concentrate in the exam?",,,"Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for one who is accountable to break his fast in Ramadan because of exams, because that is not one of the excuses that are allowed in sharee’ah. Rather he has to fast, and do his studying and revision at night if it is too hard for him to do that during the day. 
Those who are in charge of exams should be kind to the students and not make the exams in Ramadan, thus serving two interests, the interests of the fast and to help the students prepare for the exams. It was narrated in a saheeh report from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “O Allah, whoever is put in charge of any of the affairs of my ummah and is kind to them, show kindness towards him, and whoever is put in charge of any of the affairs of my ummah and is harsh towards them, show harshness towards him.” (Narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh). So my advice to those who are in charge of exams is to be kind to the students and not to have exams in Ramadaan, but to have them before or after. We ask Allah to give us all strength.","Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baz, vol. 4, p. 223"

Will I be committing a mistake/sin if I don't keep a witness and lend some money to another person?","The correct way of lending money in Islam is: 1- To specify the period of the loan. 2- Writing down the loan. 3- If the one who writes down the loan is a person other than the debtor, then the debtor is the one who should dictate to him the details of the loan. 4- If the debtor is unable to dictate because of sickness or some other reason, then the one who should dictate on his behalf is his guardian. 5- The loan should be witnessed, and the witnesses should be two men, or one man and two women. 6- The lender has the right to ask the borrower to guarantee the loan with a pledge which the lender will keep.","The correct way of lending money in Islam


Is it necessary to write down the loan in Islam?","Praise be to Allah.The correct way of lending money in Islam
The correct way of lending money is that mentioned by Allah in Surah Al-Baqarah, in the verse on debt, where Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“O you who believe! When you contract a debt for a fixed period, write it down. Let a scribe write it down in justice between you. Let not the scribe refuse to write as Allah has taught him, so let him write. Let him (the debtor) who incurs the liability dictate, and he must fear Allah, his Lord, and diminish not anything of what he owes. But if the debtor is of poor understanding, or weak, or is unable to dictate for himself, then let his guardian dictate in justice. And get two witnesses out of your own men. And if there are not two men (available), then a man and two women, such as you agree for witnesses, so that if one of them (two women) errs, the other can remind her. And the witnesses should not refuse when they are called (for evidence). You should not become weary to write it (your contract), whether it be small or big, for its fixed term, that is more just with Allah; more solid as evidence, and more convenient to prevent doubts among yourselves, save when it is a present trade which you carry out on the spot among yourselves, then there is no sin on you if you do not write it down. But take witnesses whenever you make a commercial contract. Let neither scribe nor witness suffer any harm, but if you do (such harm), it would be wickedness in you. So be afraid of Allah; and Allah teaches you. And Allah is the All-Knower of each and everything.
And if you are on a journey and cannot find a scribe, then let there be a pledge taken (mortgaging), then if one of you entrusts the other, let the one who is entrusted discharge his trust (faithfully), and let him be afraid of Allah, his Lord. And conceal not the evidence, for he who hides it, surely, his heart is sinful. And Allah is All-Knower of what you do.” [Al-Baqarah 2:282-283]
So the correct way of lending money is: 

To specify the period of the loan, i.e., the length of time after which the loan must be repaid.
To write down the loan and the time when it is to be repaid.
If the one who writes down the loan is a person other than the debtor, then the debtor is the one who should dictate to him the details of the loan.
If the debtor is unable to dictate because of sickness or some other reason, then the one who should dictate on his behalf is his guardian.
The loan should be witnessed, and the witnesses should be two men, or one man and two women.
The lender has the right to ask the borrower to guarantee the loan with a pledge which the lender will keep. The benefit of the pledge is that if the time comes for the debt to be repaid and the borrower refuses to pay, the item in pledge may be sold and the debt paid with that money; anything left over is to be given to the owner of the pledge, namely the debtor.

Is it necessary to write down the loan in Islam?
Guaranteeing a debt in one of these three ways (writing, witnesses or pledge) is recommended and is preferable, but it is not obligatory. Some of the scholars are of the view that it is obligatory to write down a loan, but most of the scholars say that it is recommended, and this is the more correct view. (See Tafsir Al-Qurtubi, 3/383)
The reason for that is to protect people’s rights so that they will not be exposed to loss because of forgetfulness or confusion, and as a precaution against those who do not fear Allah. 
If a loan is not written down and not witnessed, and no pledge is taken, that does not mean that it is a sin. The verse itself indicates that: 
“then if one of you entrusts the other, let the one who is entrusted discharge his trust (faithfully), and let him be afraid of Allah, his Lord.” [Al-Baqarah 2:283 – interpretation of the meaning]
Trust means not guaranteeing the loan by writing it down, having it witnessed or asking for a pledge. But in this case it is essential to fear Allah. Hence in this case Allah commanded the one who is in debt to fear Allah and discharge his trust: “let the one who is entrusted discharge his trust (faithfully), and let him be afraid of Allah, his Lord”. (See Tafsir As-Sa`di, 168-172) 
If the loan is not written down and the debtor denies it or takes a long time to repay it, then the lender has no one to blame but himself, because he exposed his property to loss. It was narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that if a loan is not written down, the Du’a’ of the lender against the debtor will not be accepted if he takes too long to pay or he denies the loan. He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There are three who call upon Allah but their prayer will not be answered:… a man who lent money to another man but he did not have (the loan) witnessed.” (Sahih Al-Jami`, 3075) 
Whoever thinks about these rulings and others will see the perfection of the Islamic Shari`ah and how concerned it is to protect people’s rights and not expose them to loss. For Allah commands the one who has wealth to protect it and not to expose it to loss, no matter how little it may be: 
“You should not become weary to write it (your contract), whether it be small or big, for its fixed term.” [Al-Baqarah 2:282 – interpretation of the meaning]
Is there any other law that combines the interests of this world and the Hereafter in such a perfect way as the Islamic Shari`ah does? 
Could anyone come up with anything more perfect than these rulings? 
Allah the Almighty indeed spoke the truth when He said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And who is better in judgement than Allah for a people who have firm Faith.” [Al-Ma'idah 5:50]
We ask Allah to make us steadfast in adhering to His religion until we meet Him adhering to it. 
And Allah knows best. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad and grant him peace.

13183,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13183,Do Dead Muslims Know We Miss and Love Them?,"Can a dead Muslim feel the feelings of his close relatives after his death, i.e. their sorrows, weeping, happiness and whether they are remembering him or not after him/her?
Can the soul of a good Muslim come in the world to know about his family? I heard that the soul comes to the place where he/she died for forty days.
Do we feel or see the souls of our close relatives? What is the reality of dreams about dead ones?","When a person dies, he moves from this world to another realm, and his soul does not come back to his family and they do not feel anything of him. The dead person does not know anything about the circumstances of his family, but Allah may inform some of the dead of some of the circumstances of their families, but this is not necessarily so.",,"Praise be to Allah.When a person dies, he moves from this world to another realm, and his soul does not come back to his family and they do not feel anything of him. 
What is mentioned (in the question) about the soul coming back for forty days is a myth that has no foundation. 
Similarly the dead person does not know anything about the circumstances of his family, because he is absent from them, in a state of bliss or torment, but Allah may inform some of the dead of some of the circumstances of their families, but this is not necessarily so. 
There are some reports, which cannot be relied upon, that say that the deceased may know something about his family’s circumstances. 
With regard to dreams, some of them are true and some are the playing of the devil. 
The living may come to know something of the circumstances of the dead via true dreams, but that depends on the sincerity of the one who sees the dream, whether the dream is a true dream and the ability of the one who interprets these dreams. 
Yet despite that we should not be certain of what the dream says, unless there is some evidence to indicate that. For a living person may see his deceased relative in a dream, advising him to do things or saying some things to him which he may know are true if they match reality. 
There have been some cases in which dreams matched reality and others where there is no evidence to suggest that the dreams are true. And some dreams are known to be untrue. So dreams are of three types. 
We must pay attention to that when dealing with news, reports and stories that have to do with the circumstances of the dead.

13189,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13189,How did Islamic fiqh develop?,how was the science of fiqh developed ?,,,"Praise be to Allah.During the lifetime of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) the Muslims used to receive the rulings of Islam directly from him. The Qur’aan came down as a teacher, guide and mufti, as Allaah said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“They ask you for a legal verdict. Say: “Allaah directs (thus) about Al-Kalaalah (those who leave neither descendants nor ascendants as heirs)…”[al-Nisa’ 4:176]
 And it came to explain matters concerning which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his companions were uncertain, as in the story of the woman who asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about her husband’s divorcing her by zihaar (a jaahili form of divorce in which the husband says to his wife, “You are to me as my mother’s back”), as a result of which the first verses of Soorat al-Mujaadilah were revealed. 
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to send some of his companions to teach the new Muslims how to worship and to give them legal rulings (fatwa). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to allow them a certain amount of room in understanding the texts of sharee’ah, then he would approve of their interpretation or correct them. At the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) a number of the Sahaabah used to issue fatwas (legal rulings). Some of the scholars said that they numbered fourteen, but in fact there were more than that. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was the imaam (leader) and teacher of mankind and at that time people spoke proper Arabic so whatever variations in interpretation there were, were few and minor. So the death of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was counted as a great loss to the ummah, because they lost their leader, guide and perfect example. 
It was narrated that Anas ibn Maalik said: “After the death of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), Abu Bakr said to ‘Umar, ‘Let us go to Umm Ayman and visit her as the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to do. When they came to her, she wept, and they said to her, ‘Why are you weeping? What is with Allaah is better for His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).’ She said, ‘I am not weeping because I do not know that what is with Allaah is better for His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him); rather I am weeping because the revelation from heaven has come to an end.’ She moved them to tears and they started weeping with her.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2454). But the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not die until after the religion had been completed. 
One of the characteristics of this religion, which was perfected during the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), was that it includes features which qualify it to remain and continue until the end of time. 
Therefore this religion and understanding of it remained after the death of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and it will abide until the Day of Resurrection. After the death of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), the people followed his guidance and the guidance of the Rightly-Guided khaleefahs who followed him. Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) used to judge amongst them and issue fatwas to them based on what he found in the Qur’aan and hadeeth. If he could not find an answer, he would go out and ask the Muslims, saying, “Such and such an issue has been referred to me, do you know whether the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) passed a judgement concerning such a matter?” Then perhaps a group of them would come to him, all of them saying that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had passed a judgement on it. Then Abu Bakr would say, “Praise be to Allaah Who has caused there to be among us those who memorized things from our Prophet.” And if he was unable to find any Sunnah narrated from the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), he would gather the leaders of the people and the best among them and if they agreed on something he would pass judgement according to that. 
‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) did the same after Abu Bakr had died. 
Then the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) dispersed to different regions as teachers and mujaahideen, after the expansion of the Islamic territory. Each of them used to issue fatwas in accordance with what he knew of the Qur’aan and Sunnah, or the actions of Abu Bakr or ‘Umar, or the conclusions to which his own ijtihaad led him. The muftis among the Sahaabah numbered more than one hundred, and those who issued many fatwas numbered seven, as Ibn al-Qayyim says. They were: ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab, ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib, ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood, ‘Aa’ishah Umm al-Mu’mineen, Zayd ibn Thaabit, ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Abbaas and ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with them all). 
‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) and his son, and Zayd ibn Thaabit (may Allaah be pleased with them), were in Madeenah, and many students became scholars at their hands,  such as Saalim ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar, Naafi’ and others. Their knowledge was passed to the seven fuqaha’ and ultimately to Imaam Maalik ibn Anas al-Asbahi. 
Ibn Mas’ood and then ‘Ali were in Kufa, and a number of the Taabi’een learned from them, such as ‘Ilqimah, al-Aswad, Masrooq, Shurayh al-Qaadi, Silah ibn Zafar and many others besides them, until that knowledge reached Imaam Abu Haneefah al-Nu’maan ibn Thaabit. 
Fiqh and knowledge spread throughout the ummah from the companions of Ibn Mas’ood, the companions of Zayd ibn Thaabit, the companions of ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar, and the companions of ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Abbaas. That happened in Kufa, Madeenah and Makkah, respectively. These Taabi’een used to issue fatwas when the greatest Sahaabah were present, and they granted them permission to do that.  
For example, Ibn ‘Umar used to say of Sa’eed ibn al-Musayyib: he is one of the muftis or one of those to be followed. 
And he said of him: if the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had seen him, he would have been happy with him. 
Via these people, knowledge spread far and wide. Then the ahaadeeth were compiled in books and the numbers of students increased who occupied themselves with memorizing them and writing them down; then knowledge spread throughout the earth. Most of the people were religiously-committed and aware, and this prevented anyone from speaking without knowledge or claiming to be a scholar when he was not qualified to describe himself as such. Then differences because widespread and people became involved in the field of knowledge who would have been better off refraining from it. But by the wisdom of Allaah the religion was regulated and preserved by imams whom the ummah agreed that they were leaders and knowledgeable and that they had reached the utmost degree of knowledge of rulings and fatwas. Allaah caused them to become well known and their virtue spread throughout the world. Students flocked to them to learn and study, and their views were compiled in books. The opinions of the Sunni schools of thought which followed the truth of the Qur’aan and Sunnah and which rejected innovations in religion (bid’ah), according to what was transmitted by the students of the great imams, were recorded according to what was transmitted by the students of these great scholars, so the views of each imaam became a madhhab that is followed. 
The most famous of these madhhabs nowadays are just four: the Hanafi, Maaliki, Shaafa’i and Hanbali madhhabs. The followers of these madhhabs are agreed on most matters and on the most important issues of religion, and the differences in understanding and in the evidence that reached them have to do with minor issues. All of them are following something good, may Allaah have mercy on them. Then each of these madhhabs developed in ways which it would take too long to explain here, until things became as they are nowadays, where each madhhab has books containing its issues and methods of deriving rulings and interpreting evidence. And among the imams there are, praise be to Allaah, mujtahids who can produce rulings on contemporary events and issues by means of the understanding that Allaah has bestowed upon them, using ijtihaad, qiyaas (analogy), the principles of the objectives of sharee’ah, the sayings of previous scholars, and the principles of usool al-fiqh. Thus fiqh continued to be a rich discipline, comprehending all the issues of life which the Muslims need to know about. 
At all times there is someone who is showing the correct way, based on evidence, who recognizes the truth concerning a certain issue and he knows how to reach the correct conclusion. The scholars could not agree on something that is incorrect, hence the ummah cannot all follow falsehood. We ask Allaah to cause us to understand His religion and to bless us with knowledge and righteous deeds. And Allaah knows best.

13198,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/13198,When should we offer the funeral prayer for the miscarried foetus?,"What should we do with the foetus when it is miscarried? Should we offer the funeral prayer for it and wash it, and should we give it a name, or leave it without a name? Please advise us.",,,"Praise be to Allah.If the foetus comes out 
	alive and its cry is heard, then it dies, it should be washed and the 
	funeral prayer offered for it; there is no scholarly dispute concerning 
	this. It says in al-Mughni: “The scholars are unanimously agreed that 
	if it is known to have lived and its cry has been heard, the prayer should 
	be offered for it. But if its cry is not heard, Imaam Ahmad (may Allaah have 
	mercy on him) said: “If it has completed four months [gestation], then it 
	should be washed and the funeral prayer offered. This is the view of Sa’eed 
	ibn al-Musayyib, Ibn Seereen and Ishaaq. Ibn ‘Umar offered the funeral 
	prayer for the son of his daughter who was born dead.” (al-Mughni, 
	2/328) 
It says in Masaa’il al-Imaam 
	Ahmad, which (contains reports that) were narrated by his son 
	‘Abd-Allaah: “I heard my father being asked about the newborn, when should 
	the funeral prayer be offered for him? He said: if he was miscarried after 
	four months [gestation], the funeral prayer should be offered for him. He 
	was asked, should the funeral prayer be offered for him even if his cry was 
	not heard? He said, Yes.” (Masaa’il al-Imaam Ahmad allati rawaahaa ibnuhu 
	‘Abd-Allaah, 2/482, mas’alah no. 673) 
The author of al-Mughni 
	explained the reason why the funeral prayer may be offered for one 
	concerning whom there is doubt that he lived at all, “The prayer offered for 
	him is a kind of du’aa’ for him and his parents … so there is no need to be 
	certain and sure that he lived at all, unlike matters of inheritance.”
(al-Mughni, 2/328)
Undoubtedly this is a good 
	understanding, because inheritance has to do with the rights of others, 
	whereas a prayer has to do with the relationship between a person and his 
	Lord.
With regard to a foetus of 
	less than four months gestation, it should not  be washed and the funeral 
	prayer should not be offered for it, but it should be wrapped in a cloth and 
	buried. That is because the soul is not breathed into it until after four 
	moths of gestation; before that it is not a soul so the funeral prayer 
	cannot be offered over it; it is like inanimate objects or blood. 
The evidence for that is the 
	words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “The 
	miscarried foetus should be prayed over (the funeral prayer), and 
	supplication for forgiveness and mercy for his parents should be offered.” 
	(Narrated by Abu Dawood; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 
	3525). 
In the case of a 
	miscarried foetus whose sex cannot be determined, it should be given a name 
	which is suitable for both males and females, such as Salamah, Qutaadah, 
	Sa’aadah, Hind, ‘Utbah or Hibbat-Allaah.","From Ahkaam al-Janeen fi’l-Fiqh al-Islami, by ‘Umar ibn Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem Ghaanim"
