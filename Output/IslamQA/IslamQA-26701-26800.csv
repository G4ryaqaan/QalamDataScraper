26713,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26713,Did a light shine when the Prophet peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him was born?,"Is there any reality in that before getting birth rasool as pak sallah alai salam was there in the sky as a light or (star), if it is there then can you explain me this in the light of quran and ahadis.",,,"Praise be to Allah.One of the signs of the coming of our Prophet 
     (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is that when his mother became pregnant with him, she saw in a dream that a light came out of her 
    that reached Syria. 
It was narrated from Khaalid ibn Ma’daan that the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “O Messenger of Allaah, tell us about yourself.” He said: “I am the answer to the prayer of the 
    father of Ibraaheem, and the glad tidings of ‘Eesa, and when my mother became pregnant with me, she saw something as if a light came out of her 
    and illuminated the palaces of Busra in the land of Syria.” 
Narrated by Ibn Ishaaq with his isnaad; 
    Seerat Ibn Hishaam, 1/166. Narrated with a different isnaad by al-Tabari in his Tafseer, 1/566, and by al-Haakim in al-Mustadrak, 
    2/600. He said: its isnaad is saheeh although they [al-Bukhaari and Muslim] did not narrated, and al-Dhahabi agreed with him. See al-Silsilah 
    al-Saheehah, 1545 
Al-Tabaraani narrated that the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “My mother saw in a dream that there came from between her legs a lamp that illuminated the 
    palaces of Syria.” Classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 224. 
Ahmad (16700) narrated from al-‘Irbaad ibn Saariyah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said… and he mentioned the hadeeth according to which the mother of the 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saw, when she gave birth to him, a light which illuminated the palaces of 
    Syria. 
Al-Haythami said in Majma’ al-Zawaa’id: 
    its isnaad is hasan. 
Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said in al-Fath: 
When she gave birth there came forth from her 
    a light which illuminated the house. This is supported by the hadeeth of al-‘Irbaad ibn Saariyah who said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “I was the slave of Allaah and the Seal of the Prophets, when Adam was still in the form of mud 
    on the ground, and I will tell you about that. I am the answer to the prayer of the father of Ibraaheem, the glad tidings of Eesa concerning me, 
    and the dream that my mother saw and that the mothers of the Prophets saw. The mother of the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) saw, when she gave birth to him, a light which illuminated the palaces of Syria. Narrated by Ahmad and classed as saheeh by 
    Ibn Hibbaan and al-Haakim. A similar hadeeth was narrated from Abu Umaamah by Ahmad. 
We should note that the evidence of the 
    Prophethood of our Prophet Muhammad  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is not limited to this sign. Whether this is proven or not, 
    his Prophethood is proven by definitive evidence which no fair-minded person can deny, rather those who deny it do so out of ignorance or 
    arrogance. 
We ask Allaah to cause His religion to 
    prevail and His word to be supreme.

26714,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26714,Is Delaying Hajj for No Reason Permissible?,What is the ruling on one who delays Hajj for no reason when he has the means and is able to do it?,Whoever is able to perform Hajj and delays it for no reason has committed a great evil and a major sin. He has to repent to Allah from that and hasten to do Hajj.,,"Praise be to Allah.Whoever is able to do Hajj and delays it for no reason has committed a great evil and a major sin. What he has to do is to repent to Allah from that and hasten to do Hajj.
Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah) to the House (Ka‘bah) is a duty that mankind owes to Allah, those who can afford the expenses (for one’s conveyance, provision and residence); and whoever disbelieves [i.e. denies Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah), then he is a disbeliever of Allah], then Allah stands not in need of any of the ‘Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists).” [Aal 'Imran 3:97] 
Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:
“Islam is built on five (pillars): the testimony that there is no god except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; establishing regular prayer; paying zakah; fasting Ramadan, and performing Pilgrimage to the House (the Ka’bah).” (Sahih – agreed upon. Al-Bukhari, 8; Muslim, 16) 
Prophet Muhammad also said, when Jibril (peace be upon him) asked him about Islam: “It means to testify that there is no god except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, to establish regular prayer, to pay zakah, to fast Ramadan, and to perform Pilgrimage to the House if you have the means to do so.” (Narrated by Muslim in his Sahih, 8, from the hadith of ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him)).

As for doing that after ihraam, i.e., after making the intention to enter ihraam, that is not permitted at all, because the pilgrim in ihraam is not allowed to cut his nails or remove any of his hair until he has finished his Tawaaf and Sa’ee for ‘Umrah, when he exits his ihraam by shaving his head or cutting his hair, and likewise in Hajj when he has stoned Jamarat al-‘Aqabah, when it is prescribed for him to shave his head or cut his hair, but shaving is preferable. Then he exits ihraam whether that was before offering the sacrifice or afterwards, although it is preferable to do that after the sacrifice, if possible.

26716,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26716,Zakaah in Ramadaan – should it be paid on all one’s wealth?,"I pay the zakaah on my wealth every year in Ramadaan, and I pay zakaah on the amount that was in my account in the previous Ramadaan only, i.e., wealth for which one year has passed. Is what I am doing correct? Or do I have to pay zakaah on everything that I saved during the year?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.In order for zakaah to be obligatory, one year must have passed, i.e., one hijri year must have gone by since the wealth reached the nisaab (threshold at which zakaah becomes due).  The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no zakaah on wealth until a year has passed.” (Narrated by Ibn Maajah; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel, no. 787). 
The passage of one year is also a condition for zakaah on gold, silver, paper currency and animals of the an’aam class to be obligatory. [Translator’s note: the an’aam class of animals includes camels, cattle, sheep and goats]. 
Wealth that is earned during the year is of two types: 
1 – That which is profit generated by other wealth. Zakaah on these profits is to be paid at the same time as zakaah on the principle is due. 
2 – That which is independent wealth which is gained in a manner acceptable according to sharee’ah, such as inheritance, gifts and savings from one's salary. No zakaah is due on this until one year has passed from the date when it reached the nisaab. 
The Muslim may pay the zakaah on all the wealth he has in Ramadaan, both for that for which one year has passed and for that for which one year has not passed, in order to expedite the zakaah, because of the report narrated by al-Tirmidhi, Ibn Maajah and al-Haakim, who classed it as saheeh, that al-‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) asked the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about expediting his zakaah before one year had passed, and he allowed him to do that. This hadeeth was classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, no. 545. 
This is easier than calculating the zakaah for each part of his wealth independently, so that he will not get confused about his wealth and mix up the figures, which may result in part of the zakaah not being paid or in confusion as to whether the full of amount of zakaah has been paid or not.

26728,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26728,Ruling on saying “We are the children of Allaah”,"What is the rulling on, when a Muslim say ""We believe we are all children of Allah"" Basing it on the weak Hadeeth (All creations are sustained by Allah). Please provide details of the ruling.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The hadeeth mentioned was narrated by al-Bazzaar and Abu 
    Ya’la from Anas, and says, “All of mankind are the dependents of Allaah, and 
    the most beloved of them to Allaah are those who are most helpful to their 
    dependents.” This is a very weak (da’eef jiddan) hadeeth as al-Albaani said 
    in Da’eef al-Jaami’, hadeeth no. 2946. 
Any Muslim who says, “We 
    believe that we are all the children of Allaah” should be asked to explain 
    what he means before any judgement is made concerning him. 

    1 – If what he means by being children is the metaphorical 
    meaning, which is that people are dependent upon Allaah, and he is using 
    this word for a purpose allowed in sharee’ah, such as refuting the 
    Christians who say that the Messiah is the son of God, then there is nothing 
    wrong with that if he uses it only with Christians in order to show that 
    their belief is false, but he should not use it with others lest that 
    generate confusion and misunderstanding. That is because one of the means of 
    showing the Christians’ beliefs concerning ‘Eesa (peace be upon him) to be 
    false is to use the same expressions as are mentioned in their holy Book 
    (the Bible) to prove that others were described as “sons of God” as well as 
    ‘Eesa, which clearly indicates that what is meant by being a son of God in 
    the texts of the Gospels is not “sonship” in the literal sense, which St. 
    Paul claimed for Jesus in order to lead them astray from belief in Divine 
    Oneness (Tawheed). St. Paul based his argument on the confusion that may 
    arise from the use of the words “father” and “son”. Some of the Bible texts 
    that may used to refute their argument are as follows: 

    In the Gospel of Luke, Jesus said of those who believed in 
    him: 

    “They are like the angels. They are God’s children since they 
    are children of the resurrection.” 

    [Luke 20:36] 

    And in the Book of Isaiah:

    “Bring back My sons from afar and my daughters from the ends 
    of the earth” 

    [Isaiah 43:6] 

    And this is what was said describing God as the Father, as it 
    is narrated in the Gospel of Matthew that the Messiah said to his students:

    “If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in 
    heaven.” 

    [Matthew 6:1] 

    In the Gospel of Luke:

    “When you pray say, ‘Our Father, Who art in heaven…’”

    [Luke 11:2] 

    In the Gospel of John:

    “I am returning to my Father and your Father, my God and your 
    God.”

    [John 20:17] 

    The Christians do not say that the angels, the Children of 
    Israel and the Disciples were sons of God in a literal sense, or that God 
    was their father in a literal sense, rather they interpret that in a 
    metaphorical sense, i.e., that He is a father to them in the sense of 
    blessing them, being kind to them, protecting them and taking care of them, 
    and they are His children in the sense that they worship Him, need Him and 
    are dependent upon Him. 

    This demonstrates the falseness of their understanding of 
    ‘Eesa being the son of God, basing their argument on some texts that say 
    that he is the son of God. 

    2 – If he means that all people are children of Allaah just 
    as ‘Eesa is the son of Allaah, in the sense of the Christian belief, then 
    this is kufr (disbelief) that is worse than the kufr of the Christians. 

    3 – If he means that we are all children of Allaah or 
    dependent upon Him, with no difference between Muslims and kaafirs, and he 
    means that the Jews, Christians and idol-worshippers are not kaafirs, then 
    this is riddah or apostasy from Islam, because whoever doubts that the Jews 
    and Christians are kaafirs or approves of their religions is a kaafir, 
    according to scholarly consensus. 

    4 – If he means thereby to justify using the word “brother” 
    for Jews and Christians, because we are all the children of Allaah, this is 
    false, because there is no brotherhood between the believers and the 
    disbelievers. The hadeeth (which some may interpret as meaning that all men 
    are brothers) has been proven to be not saheeh. Even if it was saheeh, it 
    could not be interpreted in this fashion. 

    We must beware of using confusing words which may cause a 
    person to fall into something haraam or make people think badly of him, 
    especially words which have to do with the Oneness of Allaah (Tawheed) and 
    His Uniqueness in His names and attributes. For the rights of Allaah take 
    precedence and must be taken care of, and we must avoid anything that may 
    violate them, especially when those words are used by the Jews and Allaah 
    quotes them in the Qur’aan in the context of condemnation. 

    “And (both) the Jews and the Christians say: ‘We are the 
    children of Allaah and His loved ones.’ Say: ‘Why then does He punish you 
    for your sins?’ Nay, you are but human beings of those He has created…”

If you see that she has repented and regrets what she did, and that she is serious about keeping away from non-mahram men and avoiding being alone with them, then it is permissible for you to marry her.

My advice to you is to look for a righteous and chaste women, for a righteous wife will bring you happiness in this world and will be one of the means of your salvation in the Hereafter, because she will one day be the mother of your children, and she will guard your honour and your wealth, and in that way there will be the love, compassion and tranquility that form the basis of marital happiness. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):

“And among His Signs is this, that He created for you wives from among yourselves, that you may find repose in them, and He has put between you affection and mercy”
[al-Room 30:21]

The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Women are married for four reasons: wealth, beauty, lineage and religious commitment. Choose the one who is religiously-committed, may your hands be rubbed with dust (i.e., may you prosper).” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3/242; Muslim, 2/1086.

According to another hadeeth: “This world is temporary pleasures and the best of the temporary pleasures of this world is a righteous wife.” Narrated by Muslim, 2668.

With regard to what you mention about what happened with that other girl, praise be to Allaah for having enabled you to repent. This is the bounty of Allaah towards you. You have to strive to control yourself and avoid the things which lead to such serious consequences.

We wish to point out that repentance must be for the sake of Allaah, not for the sake of your fiancée and so that she will be sincere towards you. So we advise you to renew your repentance and to pray for forgiveness and to make a promise to Allaah not to do such a thing again.

I also offer the following advice, and hope that Allaah will benefit you thereby:

1 – Lower your gaze and do not look at that which Allaah has forbidden.

2 – Keep yourself busy with reading Qur’aan and hadeeth, stories of the righteous, the scholars and ascetics.

3 – Beware of being alone with women who are not mahrams.

4 – Keep company with righteous people who will help you with religious and worldly matters.

5 – Beware of listening to music and songs, for they are a means that lead to zina.

6 – Strive to offer prayers regularly with the Muslims, and strive to observe all the essential parts of prayer with proper focus and humility, and having wudoo’, for it keeps one away from evil actions, and those who observe regular prayer are the ones who will succeed. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):

“Successful indeed are the believers.
Those who offer their Salaah (prayers) with all solemnity and full submissiveness”

Instinctive evidence of the existence of God

Shar’i evidence of the existence of God




Why did God create us?","Praise be to Allah.Calling to Allah: Prophet’s Mission
My dear Muslim brother, your efforts to call people to Allah and explain the reality of Allah’s existence make us very happy. Finding out about Allah is in tune with the sound fitrah (natural inclinations of man) and with sound reasoning. How many there are who, once the truth becomes clear to them, they hasten to submit to Allah (enter Islam). If each one of us was to do his duty towards his religion, a great deal of good would be achieved. 
So we congratulate you, our brother, for undertaking the mission of the prophets and messengers, and we give you glad tidings of the great reward which you are promised, as your Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If Allah were to guide one man at your hands, that would be better for you than red camels.” (al-Bukhari and Muslim) “Red camels” are the best kind of camels. 
Evidence of the existence of God
With regard to proof of the existence of Allah, it is obvious to anyone who ponders the matter, and there is no need for a lengthy discussion. When we ponder the matter, we find that it is divided into three categories: instinctive evidence, tangible evidence and shar’i (revelatory) evidence. We will explain this to you further, in sha Allah. 
Instinctive evidence of the existence of God 
Al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said: 
The instinctive evidence that God exists is the strongest of all evidence for those who are not led astray by the devils. Hence Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“So set you (O Muhammad) your face towards the religion (of pure Islamic Monotheism) Haneef (worship none but Allah Alone). Allah’s Fitrah (i.e. Allah’s Islamic Monotheism) with which He has created mankind.” [30:30] 
Man’s sound nature (fitrah) testifies to the existence of God and man cannot turn away from this unless the devils mislead him; whoever is misled by the devils may not recognize this evidence.” (From Sharh al-Safariniyyah) 
Every person feels inside himself that he has a Lord and Creator, and he feels that he is in need of Him; if some major calamity befalls him he turns his hands, eyes and heart towards the heavens, seeking help from his Lord. 
Tangible evidence of the existence of God
This refers to the things that exist in this universe; we see around us things that exist, such as trees, rocks, mankind, the earth, the heavens, seas, rivers… 
If it is asked: these things are so many – who created them and is taking care of them? 
The answer is that if these things came into being by accident, spontaneously and with no cause, then there is no one who knows how they were created, and that is one possibility. But there is another possibility, which is that these things created themselves and are taking care of themselves. And there is a third possibility, which is that there is Someone Who created them. When we look at these three possibilities, we find that the first and the second are impossible. If we reject the first and the second, then the third must be the one which is correct, which is that these things have a Creator Who created them, and that Creator is Allah . This is what is stated in the Quran, where Allah says (what means): 
“Were they created by nothing? Or were they themselves the creators? Or did they create the heavens and the earth? Nay, but they have no firm belief.” [52:35] 
Moreover, when were these mighty things created? For all these years, who is it that has decreed that they should remain in this world and has granted them the means of abiding? 
The answer is it is Allah Who has given to each thing that which is suited to it and will guarantee its survival. Do you not see the beautiful green plants; when Allah cuts off their water supply, can they live? No, rather they become dry stalks. If you ponder all things you will find that they are dependent upon Allah. Were it not for Allah, nothing would remain. 
And Allah has created everything to do that for which it is suited. So camels, for example, are for riding. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Do they not see that We have created for them of what Our Hands have created, the cattle, so that they are their owners. And We have subdued them unto them so that some of them they have for riding and some they eat.” [36:71-72]
Look at the camel and how Allah has created it strong, with a strong back, so that it can be used for riding and it is able to endure harsh conditions which other animals cannot bear.
If you look at other creatures, you will find that they are suited to the purposes for which they were created. Glory be to Allah.
Other examples of tangible evidence include the following:
When calamities befall people this points to the existence of the Creator, for example, when they call upon Allah and Allah responds to their prayer; this points to the existence of Allah. 
Al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said: 
“When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) prayed for rain, he said, ‘Allahumma aghithna, Allahumma aghithna (O Allah, send us rain, O Allah, send us rain).’ Then a cloud came and it started to rain before he had even come down from the minbar (pulpit). This points to the existence of the Creator.” (Sharh al-Safariniyyah).
Shar’i evidence of the existence of God
 All divinely-revealed laws point to the existence of Allah. Al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin said:
“All the divinely-revealed laws point to the existence of the Creator and to the perfect nature of His knowledge, wisdom and mercy, because these laws must have been prescribed by someone, and that Lawgiver is Allah.” (From Sharh al-Safariniyyah).
Why did God create us?
With regard to your question: Why did Allah create us?
The answer is: so that we would worship Him, thank Him and remember Him, and do that which He has commanded us. You know that among mankind there are disbelievers and there are Muslims. This is because Allah wants to test His slaves as to whether they will worship Him or worship others. That is after Allah has shown the way to everyone. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Who has created death and life that He may test you which of you is best in deed.” [67:2]
“And I (Allah) created not the jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone).” [51:56]
We ask Allah to enable us and you to do that which He loves and is pleased with, and to do more da’wah (propagation) and work for the sake of His religion.

26746,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26746,Should the one who is praying behind the imam recite al-Fatihah or listen to the recitation of the imam?,"Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has instructed us to listen quietly and attentively when the Quran is being recited: “So, when the Quran is recited, listen to it, and be silent that you may receive mercy” [al-A‘raaf 7:204]. And the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) warned us that any prayer in which al-Fatihah is not recited is invalid.
I hope that you can tell me what I should do to avoid falling into that which goes against either of these two injunctions, if the imam does not leave enough time for the people praying behind him to recite al-Fatihah. What is the correct opinion regarding this matter?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.In the answer to question no. 10995 we explained that reciting al-Fatihah is one of the pillars or essential parts of the prayer for the imam, the one who is praying behind an imam and the one who is praying on his own. 
Secondly: 
With regard to the pause that some imams leave after reciting al-Fatihah, it is not long enough for the one who is praying behind the imam to recite al-Fatihah; rather it is only a brief pause that serves to separate between the recitation of al-Fatihah and the recitation of another soorah. 
 Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
The pause between the recitation of al-Fatihah and another soorah was not narrated from the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), despite the view of some of the fuqaha’, that the imam should pause so as to allow those praying behind him to recite al-Fatihah. Rather it is a brief pause that is intended for one to catch one’s breath on the one hand, and to allow the one who is praying behind the imam, on the other hand, to start to recite (al-Fatihah) and he should complete it, even if the imam is reciting, because it is a brief pause, not a long one. End quote.
Fatawa Arkaan al-Islam, p. 323-324 
If the imam does not pause for a long time after reciting al-Fatihah, then the one who is praying behind him has to recite al-Fatihah, even if that is at the same time as the imam is reciting the other soorah, because this is what was the Prophet (blessing and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed his companions to do in Fajr prayer. 
Abu Dawood (823) narrated that ‘Ubaadah ibn as-Saamit (may Allah be pleased with him) said: We were behind the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) in Fajr prayer. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) recited, and he found it difficult to recite (due to interference). When he finished praying he said: “Perhaps you were reciting behind your imam?” We said: Yes, O Messenger of Allah. He said: “Do not do that, apart from the Opening of the Book (al-Fatihah), because there is no prayer for the one who does not recite it.” 
Classed as hasan by al-Tirmidhi; classed as saheeh by al-Bayhaqi, al-Khattaabi and others. This is a clear statement that it is obligatory for the one who is praying behind an imam to recite al-Fatihah in a prayer in which recitation is done out loud. 
Shaykh Ibn Baaz said: If the imam does not pause, the one who is praying behind him has to recite al-Fatihah even if that is when the imam is reciting (the other soorah), according to the more correct scholarly view.
End quote from Fatawa ash-Shaykh Ibn Baz, 11/221 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
If it is asked: if the imam does not pause, when should the one who is praying behind him recite al-Fatihah? The answer is: he should recite al-Fatihah when the imam is still reciting, because the Sahaabah used to recite al-Fatihah with the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and he said: “Do not do that except with the Essence of the Book (al-Fatihah), because there is no prayer for the one who does not recite it.""(Fatawa Arkaan al-Islam, p. 322)
With regard to the words of Allah (interpretation of the meaning): “So, when the Quran is recited, listen to it, and be silent that you may receive mercy” [Al-A‘raaf 7:204], this is general in meaning, except when one has to recite al-Fatihah, in the sense that it is obligatory to listen attentively to the imam’s recitation of Qur’aan in prayer, except when the one who is praying behind him is reciting al-Fatihah only. This is based on the words of the Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him): “Do not do that, apart from the Opening of the Book (al-Fatihah), because there is no prayer for the one who does not recite it.” And that was in Fajr prayer, which is a prayer in which recitation is done out loud, as is well known. 
So the one who is praying behind the imam is enjoined to listen attentively except when he is reciting al-Fatihah.

Can she earn extra rewards for engaging herself in worship? If so, what is permissible for her to do on that night?","A Menstruating woman can do the following on Laylat al-Qadr:
1.	Recite the Quran
2.	Make dhikr
3.	Make istighfar
4.	Make du’a",,"Praise be to Allah.A woman who is menstruating may do all acts of worship apart from praying, fasting, circumambulating the Ka’bah and doing i’tikaf in the mosque. 
It was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to stay up at night during the last ten nights of Ramadan. Al-Bukhari (2401) and Muslim (1174) narrated that ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “When the last ten nights of Ramadan came, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would refrain from marital relations, stay up at night and wake his family up.”  
Staying up at night is not only for prayer, rather it includes all kinds of acts of worship. This is how the scholars interpreted it. 
Al-Hafiz said: “Staying up at night ” means staying up to do acts of worship.” 
Al-Nawawi said: “Spending the night staying up to pray etc.” 
He said in ‘Awn al-Ma'bud: “I.e., in prayer, dhikr and reciting the Quran.”
Praying qiyam is the best act of worship that a person can do on Laylat al-Qadr. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever spends the night of Laylat al-Qadr in prayer out of faith and in hope of reward, his previous sins will be forgiven.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1901; Muslim, 760) 
Because the woman who is menstruating is not allowed to pray, she can spend the night in doing other acts of worship apart from prayer, such as: 
1- Reading or reciting Quran . 
2- Dhikr – such as saying Subhan-Allah , La ilaha illa-Allah, al-Hamdu Lillah, etc. She can repeat the words “Subhan-Allah wa’l-hamdu Lillah, wa la ilaha illa-Allah, wa Allahu akbar (Glory be to Allah, praise be to Allah, there is no god but Allah and Allah is Most Great)” and “Subhan Allah wa bi hamdihi, subhan Allah il-‘Azim (Glory and praise be to Allah, glory be to Allah the Almighty)” etc.
3- Istighfar (praying for forgiveness), by repeating the phrase “Astaghfir-Allah (I ask Allah for forgiveness).”
4- Du’a (supplication) – she can pray to Allah and ask Him for what is good in this world and in the Hereafter, for du'a’ is one of the best acts of worship. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Du’a is ‘ibadah (worship).” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2895; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi, 2370).
 The woman who is menstruating can do these acts of worship and others on Laylat al-Qadr.

26758,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26758,Ruling On Converting to Islam for Marriage,"I was told that if a person was to become a Muslim to get married to a Muslim girl for example, even if not truly out of faith, then it is still accepted by God. Since this way one more person is becoming a Muslim, and especially that his children would be Muslims instead of Christians for example. So what do you say about that?","If a person converts to Islam, even with the intention of marriage, he will look at the perfection of Islam and be encouraged to form a sincere intention, so he will become sincere towards Allah and become a good Muslim, and Allah will accept his Islam.","Actions are but by intention


Converting to Islam for Marriage","Praise be to Allah.Actions are but by intention
The basis of faith is in the hearts, and so the intention plays a major role in Islamic Shari`ah. This is indicated in the hadith which the scholars regard as half of the religion of Islam, and with which many scholars begin their books, such as al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) in his Sahih. He narrated that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab said: “I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “Actions are but by intention and each person will have but that which he intended. So whoever migrated for some worldly purpose or for the sake of a woman whom he could marry, his migration was for the purpose that he intended.” (al-Bukhari, 1). According to the version narrated by Muslim, “So whoever migrated for the sake of Allah and His Messenger, his migration was for the sake of Allah and His Messenger, and whoever migrated for some worldly purpose or for the sake of a woman whom he could marry, his migration was for the purpose that he intended.” (Muslim, 2530) 
Converting to Islam for Marriage
Based on the above, this matter may be examined from two angles: 

The first has to do with the acceptance of this person’s Islam by Allah. The hadith indicates that it will not be accepted if this (marrying a woman) is the only intention that he has and faith has not entered his heart. 
The second has to do with applying the rulings of Islam to him. If this person utters the Shahadatayn and follows the teachings of Islam, and does not do anything that would nullify his Islam, then he should be treated like any other Muslim, and his marriage to this Muslim woman may be accepted. That is because we are commanded by Shari`ah to deal with people according to how they appear to be; we are not commanded to enquire into what is in their hearts. It says in the hadith of Abu Sa’id al-Khudri that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: I was not commanded to enquire into what is in people’s hearts or to find out their secrets.” (Al-Bukhari, 4004; Muslim, 1763)

Perhaps if this person enters Islam , even if it is with this intention, he will look at the perfection of Islam and be encouraged to form a sincere intention, so he will become sincere towards Allah and become a good Muslim, and Allah will accept his Islam. 
Those who are in touch with this person can advise him to make sure that his intention is primarily to seek the pleasure of Allah and to enter into Islam truly, and his marriage will then be a consequence or a means of his entering into the blessing of Islam, and not an aim in and of itself. 
This girl could make marriage to her a means of encouraging him to become Muslim, as happened in the case of Umm Sulaym (may Allah be pleased with her) and her marriage to Abu Talhah (may Allah be pleased with him). 
Anas said:  “Abu Talhah married Umm Sulaym, and the dowry between them was Islam. Umm Sulaym had become Muslim before Abu Talhah. He proposed marriage to her and she said, ‘I have become Muslim; if you become Muslim I will marry you.’ So he became Muslim and that was the dowry between them.” (Al-Nasai, 3288; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Sunan al-Nasai, 3133)
With regard to the reason for accepting him – as mentioned in the question – being to increase the number of Muslims, this is not correct, because increasing the number of Muslims, even though this is something good and desirable, is not a reason for accepting anyone who claims to be a Muslim but does not really believe in Islam, because Islam is concerned with quality as well as quantity, it is not concerned only with quantity. One person who sincerely believes in the religion is better than a thousand who are lying about it.

    have mercy on him) said: 
Whoever pays on behalf on one whose zakaat 
    al-fitr he is not obliged to pay must have his permission. So if Zayd pays it on behalf of ‘Amr without his permission, that is not valid, because 
    Zayd is not obliged to pay zakaat al-fitr on behalf of ‘Amr. It is essential that the right intention (niyyah) be formed, either on the part of 
    the one who is obliged to pay it or on the part of the one who pays it on his behalf. This is based on a principle that is well known to the 
    fuqaha’, which they called tasarruf al-fudooli, referring to the question of when a person acts on behalf of another without his 
    permission, is the action completely invalid or does it depend on the permission and approval of the other person? 
There is a dispute among the scholars on this matter. The most correct view is that it is valid 
    if the other person gives his approval. And the Shaykh quoted the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah’s interaction with the Shaytaan when he was guarding the 
    zakaah. See the text of this hadeeth in the answer to question no. 6092. This is 
    corroborated by the fact that the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) approved of this action on the part of Abu Hurayrah 
    and regarded it as valid, even those what was taken from was zakaah, and Abu Hurayrah was appointed to guard it, and not anyone else.

This is the only source of income that we have been living on up till now. I hope that you can tell us whether the income we have gotten from this job is haram or not.","It is not permissible to work in riba-based banks at all because that involves consuming riba, or writing it down, or witnessing it, or helping those who do that.","Is working in a bank haram?


Evidence for the prohibition of working in a bank","Praise be to Allah.Is working in a bank haram?
We ask Allah to reward you with good for your keenness and efforts to find out the truth, and to help your husband to find permissible employment in which there is no sin. 
Note that it is not permissible to work in riba-based banks at all , because that involves consuming riba, or writing it down, or witnessing it, or helping those who do that. 
The major scholars have issued fatwas stating that working in riba-based banks is haram , even if the job does not involve dealing with riba as such, e.g. guards, cleaners and other services. We will quote to you some of their fatwas, whilst also pointing out that your husband’s work is strongly connected to riba and to recording and documenting it, because as you say, his main job is to ensure that all the computer systems are working correctly, and installing new systems, and assisting the bank employees. 
Evidence for the prohibition of working in a bank
It says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 15/41: 
“It is not permissible for a Muslim to work in a bank that deals with riba , even if the work that the Muslim does has nothing to do with riba, because he is giving the employees who do work with riba with what they need and he is helping them with their calculation of interest. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“but do not help one another in sin and transgression” [al-Maidah 5:2]”
The Standing Committee (15/38) was asked: what is the ruling on working in the existing banks? 
They replied: 
“Most of the transactions that are done nowadays involve riba, which is haram according to the Qur`an and Sunnah and the consensus of the ummah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ruled that whoever helps the one who consumes riba or pays it by writing it down for him or bearing witness to it, etc, is a partner of the one who consumes it and the one who pays it, and they are all cursed and expelled from the mercy of Allah. In Sahih Muslim and elsewhere it is narrated that Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed the one who consumes riba, the one who pays it, the one who writes it down and the two who witness it, and he said, “They are all the same.”  
Those who work in banks are helping the owners of the banks by administering their operations, whether in writing or bearing witness, or transferring papers or handing over money, or doing other things that help those who deal in riba. Hence it is known that working in an existing bank is haram. The Muslim should avoid that and should try to earn a living in a way that Allah has permitted; and there are many such ways. He should fear Allah his Lord, and not expose himself to the curse of Allah and His Messenger.”
And the Standing Committee (15/55) was asked: 
(a) Is working in banks, especially in Muslim countries, halal or haram?
(b) Is there any specific section of the bank that is halal, as many think, and if that is correct could you explain further?
They replied: 
“Firstly: working in banks that deal with riba is haram, whether that is in a Muslim country or a non-Muslim country, because it involves cooperating in sin and transgression, which Allah has forbidden as He says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“but do not help one another in sin and transgression” [al-Maidah 5:2]
Secondly: There is no section in the riba-based bank that is exempt from this ruling according to what we know of the pure shari’ah, because all the bank employees are cooperating in sin and transgression.”
And the Standing Committee (15/18) was asked: 
What is the ruling on working as a maintenance engineer for one of the electronics companies that deal with some of the riba-based banks, where the company sells equipment (calculators, cameras, telephones) to the bank, and tells us, as maintenance engineers, to go to the bank to service this equipment on a regular basis?  Is this work haram on the basis that the bank does its accounts and organizes its work on these machines, and are we thus helping them in sin? 
They replied: 
“It is not permissible for you to work for companies that are as you described, because that involves cooperating in sin and transgression.”
And it says in Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah (15/48): 
“It is not permissible for a Muslim to work in banks that deal with riba , because that involves helping them to engage in riba-based transactions in one way or another, by writing them down, witnessing them, guarding the bank, etc. Helping them in that manner is cooperating in sin and transgression, which Allah forbade when He said (interpretation of the meaning): 
“but do not help one another in sin and transgression” [al-Maidah 5:2]”
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked: is it permissible to work for a riba-based organization as a driver or guard? 
He replied: 
“It is not permissible to work for a riba-based organization even if you are a driver or a guard, because accepting employment with a riba-based organization implies that you approve of them, as whoever denounces something could not work to serve its interests. If he works to serve its interests, he must approve of it, and the one who approves of something haram has a share in its sin. With regard to those who are directly involved in writing down transactions, transferring money, depositing money, etc, are undoubtedly dealing directly with something that is haram. It was proven from the hadith of Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed the one who consumes riba, the one who pays it, the one who writes it down and the two who witness it, and he said, “They are all the same.” (Fatawa Islamiyyah, 2/401 )
And there are other well-known fatwas which forbid working in riba-based banks, no matter what the kind of work involved. Based on this, your husband has to repent to Allah from what he has done in the past, and leave this work, seeking the help of Allah, putting his trust in Him and being certain that He will grant him provision. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“And whosoever fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allah will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allah has set a measure for all things” [al-Talaq 65:2-3]
We ask Allah to make us independent by means of that which is halal so that we will have no need of that which is haram.

    doing of advising your husband and his relatives in the best manner, until 
    you find among these people someone whom Allaah will guide at your hands to 
    give up these haraam actions. In this way it will become easier for those

    adhere to the commands of sharee’ah. You have to seek help in your efforts 
    to advise them by praying to Allaah for these people, being kind to them and 
    not acting superior to them, but rather showing kindness and compassion 
    towards them, because that is more likely to be accepted and this is 
    something that may earn their respect despite your young age.

     In addition to that, you must also strive 
    to avoid joining them in the wrong things that they are doing, lest you 
    yourself weaken with regard to these evil actions, especially the bad movies 
    that you mentioned. The believer cannot assume that he is safe from 
    temptation, rather he must help himself to fight it by keeping away from bad 
    things and by making du’aa’.

     With regard to what you said about feeling 
    sad, jealous and angry for the sake of one’s religion, this is a blessing 
    from Allaah to His slave – but these feelings must be controlled according 
    to the guidelines of sharee’ah. Sadness should not lead to despair and so 
    on. Allaah said to His Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon 
    him):

    “So 
    destroy not yourself (O Muhammad) in sorrow for them”

    [Faatir 35:8]

    Anger should not put off those whom 
    you are calling, for the purpose is to reform him, not simply to express 
    one's frustration and anger.

     So long as your husband is a Muslim who 
    prays and is kind (as you mention), then be patient with him and continue to 
    call him (da’wah); perhaps Allaah will bless you by guiding him and causing 
    him to follow the ways of chastity.

     Perhaps if you think about the calamities 
    that have befallen other wives who have suffered because of husbands who are 
    worse than yours, that will make you put your husband’s sins into

Also please note that she is not allowed to wear anything but a scarf on her head and a knee-length shirt over trousers, on grounds of necessity. Some people have told the women that doing this kind of work is better than being dependent on the social agencies that offer help to families whose head is out of work.",,,"Praise be to Allah.With regard to offering alcohol and pork to the residents of the home for the elderly, this is undoubtedly haram, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed ten types of people with regard to alcohol, including the one who carries it and the one who pours it. It was narrated that Anas ibn Maalik (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed ten types of people with regard to wine: the one who presses (the grapes), the one for whom it is pressed, the one who drinks it, the one who carries it, the one to whom it is carried, the one who pours it, the one who sells it and consumes its price, the one who buys it and the one for whom it is bought.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1295; Abu Dawood, 3674). So it is not permissible to carry it or serve it and to be paid for that. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When Allah forbids people to eat something, He also forbids its price to them [i.e., they are not allowed to sell it].” (Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani – may Allah have mercy on him) in Saheeh Abi Dawood, no. 2978). 
It is also well known that alcohol and pork are forbidden in the Qur’aan. 
There remain two further issues of concern: 
The first is that the Muslim woman who works in this home is not wearing complete shar’i hijaab. 
The second is that washing the elderly people and changing their diapers will lead to seeing and touching their ‘awrahs. This is permissible in cases of necessity, but I do not think they will appoint men to take care of men and women to take care of women; usually they bring all the people together in one place and both women and men work with both sexes. 
So my advice is that a Muslim woman, in particular, should not work in this place. This work is also not desirable because it involves dealing with impure things. Accepting help from the social institution, even though it involves the humiliation of the Muslim taking aid from the kaafirs, is still easier to bear that this work which involves going against sharee’ah.

If it is simply deposited without interest, it is still wiser not to do that except in cases of necessity if the bank is one that deals with interest, because depositing money in the bank, even if no interest is involved, is still helping them to conduct their riba-based transactions, so there is the fear that the person who does that may be counted as one of those who help others in sin and transgression, even if he does not intend to do so. So we must beware of that which Allaah has forbidden and look for acceptable ways of saving our money and disposing of it.

26792,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26792,Hell will never cease to exist and neither will its people,"Allah threatens the kaafirs and atheists with Hell, “they will abide therein for ages” [al-Naba’ 78:23]. Will their torment in the Fire continue forever, and if so, doesn’t that contradict Allah’s justice and mercy? Or will their punishment last for ages the length of which is known to Allah, and if so, what will their fate be after that, is there any reference to that in the Quran or Sunnah?",,,"Praise be to Allah.What Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah believe is that Hell will never cease to exist or be extinguished, and no one will be brought forth from it except the sinners among the people of Tawheed. As for the kuffaar and atheists, they will abide therein forever. 
Imaam Ibn Hazm said in his book Maraatib al-Ijmaa’: “Hell is real; it is an abode of torment that will never cease to exist, and its people will never cease to exist, they will remain there without end.” 
And he said in his book al-Fasl fi’l-Milal wa’l-Ahwa’ wa’l-Nihal: “All the sects of the ummah are agreed that Paradise and its delights will never cease to exist, and that Hell and its torments will never cease to exist, except for al-Jahm ibn Safwaan, Abu’l-Hudhayl al-‘Allaaf and some of the Raafidis. As for Jahm, he said that Paradise and Hell will cease to exist, as will their people. Abu’l-Hudhayl said that Paradise and Hell will not cease to exist, and neither will their people, but their movements will cease and they will remain immobile, never moving, and their people will be alive, being blessed or tormented. And that group of Raafidis said that the people of Paradise will come out of Paradise, and the people of Hell will come out of Hell, to wherever Allah wants to take them.” 
(al-Fasl 4/154, Dar al-Jeel edition) 
Al-Tahhaawi said in his ‘Aqeedah: “Paradise and Hell are two created entities that will never cease to exist or come to an end.” 
There is a great deal of evidence in the Quran and Sunnah to confirm this belief. For example, Allah says (interpretation of the meanings): 
“They will long to get out of the Fire, but never will they get out therefrom; and theirs will be a lasting torment”
[al-Maa'idah 5:37]
“(The torment) will not be lightened for them, and they will be plunged into destruction with deep regrets, sorrows and in despair therein”
[al-Zukhruf 43:75] 
“Their reward with their Lord is ‘Adn (Eden) Paradise (Gardens of Eternity), underneath which rivers flow. They will abide therein forever”
[al-Bayyinah 98:8] 
“No sense of fatigue shall touch them, nor shall they (ever) be asked to leave it [Paradise]”
[al-Hijr 15:48]
“And they will never get out of the Fire”
[al-Baqarah 2:167] 
“and they will not enter Paradise until the camel goes through the eye of the needle”
[al-A’raaf 7:40] 
“Neither will it have a complete killing effect on them so that they die nor shall its torment be lightened for them. Thus do We requite every disbeliever!”
[Faatir 35:36]
In the Sunnah, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Death will come on the Day of Resurrection like a black and white ram, and it will stand between Paradise and Hell. It will be said, ‘O people of Paradise, do you recognize this?’ They will crane their necks and look, and will say, ‘Yes, it is death.’ 
It will be said, ‘O people of Hell, do you recognize this?’ They will crane their necks and look, and will say, ‘Yes, it is death.’ Then the command will be issued and it will be slaughtered. Then it will be said, ‘O People of Paradise, it is eternal and there is no death. O people of Hell, it is eternal and there is no death.’” Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) recited the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 
“And warn them (O Muhammad) of the Day of grief and regrets, when the case has been decided, while (now) they are in a state of carelessness, and they believe not”
[Maryam 19:39]
(Narrated by Muslim, 5087, from the hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri) 
This clear saheeh text leaves no room for doubt concerning this matter, which is that the people of Hell will abide therein forever, and will not die or come out, just as the people of Paradise will abide therein forever. 
The commentator of al-Tahhaawiyyah said: “Many reports of the Sunnah indicate that those who said Laa ilaaha ill-Allah will be brought forth from Hell. The ahaadeeth about intercession clearly indicate that the sinners among the people of Tawheed will be brought forth from Hell and that this applies only to them; if the kuffaar were to be brought forth from it, they would be like the believers, and that contradicts the exclusiveness indicated in the hadeeth.”
(Sharh al-Tahhaawiyyah, p. 430, al-Maktab al-Islami edition). 
With regard to the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): 
“They will abide therein for ages [ahqaab].
Nothing cool shall they taste therein, nor any drink.
Except boiling water, and dirty wound discharges”
[al-Naba’ 78:23-25]
what is meant, as al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said, is “They will stay in the Fire for as long as those ages last, and these ages will never cease. Every time one age ceases, another will come. Huqub means a lifetime or an age, and (the plural) ahqaab means ages. Hiqbah means a year, the plural of which is hiqab. Huqb means eighty years, or it was said that it means more than that, as we shall see, and the plural is ahqaab. The meaning in this verse is that they will abide therein for the ages of the Hereafter, to which there is no end. The verse does not specifically mention the Hereafter (by saying “the ages of the Hereafter”) because it is clear that the context here is speaking of the Hereafter. It is like saying the days of the Hereafter, days after days, without end. If it was referring to time it would have mentioned a specific length of time, such as five ages or ten ages, etc. The word ahqaab/huqub is used because that was the longest period of time according to the Arabs, so they would understand that. It is a metaphor for eternity, i.e., that they would abide therein forever. And it was said that ages (ahqaab) were mentioned rather than days because ahqaab is more indicative of eternity. These meaning are very similar. 
This eternal abiding is for the mushrikeen. The verse may also be interpreted as referring to the sinners who will be brought forth from Hell after these ages have passed. 
And it was said that ahqaab refers to the time when they will drink the hameem (boiling water) and ghasaaq (dirty wound discharges). When that comes to an end they will have another kind of punishment. Hence Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
‘They will abide therein for ages [ahqaab].
Nothing cool shall they taste therein, nor any drink.
Except boiling water, and dirty wound discharges’
[al-Naba’ 78:23-25].” 
(From Tafseer al-Qurtubi) 
With regard to the aayah: 
“As for those who are wretched, they will be in the Fire, sighing in a high and low tone.
They will dwell therein for all the time that the heavens and the earth endure, except as your Lord wills. Verily, your Lord is the Doer of whatsoever He intends (or wills).”
[Hood 11:106-107 – interpretation of the meaning]
Al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) mentioned in his Tafseer eleven scholarly opinions, all of which indicate that the kuffaar will abide forever in Hell.  One of these opinions states that the exception applies only to the sinners among the believers, who will be brought forth from Hell after some time. On this basis, the phrase ‘As for those who are wretched’ is general and applies to both kaafirs and sinners, and the exception refers to the word ‘khaalideena [translated here as dwell therein for all the time]’. In al-Saheeh it is narrated that Anas ibn Maalik said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Some people will enter Hell, then when they are like ashes, they will be brought forth from it and admitted to Paradise, and it will be said, ‘These are the Jahannamiyyeen (the hellish ones).’”
(Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6896). 
Another view is that illa (except) here [ in the phrase translated as They will dwell therein for all the time that the heavens and the earth endure, except as your Lord wills] means siwa (apart from), as in the phrase ma ma’i rajulun illa Zayd (there is no man with me apart from Zayd). So the meaning here is: so long as the heavens and the earth endure, apart from (or in addition to) the eternity which Allah wills they should abide therein. 
We have refrained from quoting all the opinions here for the sake of brevity, but the reader may benefit from referring to them. 
Hence we may note that the teaching of the Quran and Sunnah, and scholarly consensus (ijmaa’), that Hell and its people will remain forever, is not contradicted by any clear saheeh text of the Book of Allah or the Sunnah of His Messenger, or by any report from the Sahaabah and Taabi’een. 
So this is the answer to your question, “Or will their punishment last for ages the length of which is known to Allah, and if so, what will their fate be after that, is there any reference to that in the Quran or Sunnah?” 
We may add here that in the texts that we have quoted and in others that we have not mentioned, there is evidence to confirm the beliefs of Ahl al-Sunnah in this matter. The fact that the texts do not say anything about their fate after those ages proves what we have mentioned, that those ages will not come to an end. May Allah protect us and you from that. 
There is nothing in what we have mentioned that contradicts the mercy and justice of Allah. Rather this is what is implied by His justice and mercy, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“But those who disbelieve (in the Oneness of Allah — Islamic Monotheism), for them will be the fire of Hell. Neither will it have a complete killing effect on them so that they die nor shall its torment be lightened for them. Thus do We requite every disbeliever!
Therein they will cry: ‘Our Lord! Bring us out, we shall do righteous good deeds, not (the evil deeds) that we used to do.’ (Allah will reply:) ‘Did We not give you lives long enough, so that whosoever would receive admonition could receive it? And the warner came to you. So taste you (the evil of your deeds). For the Zaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers) there is no helper.’”
[Faatir 35:36-37]
“Verily, the Mujrimoon (criminals, sinners, disbelievers) will be in the torment of Hell to abide therein forever.
(The torment) will not be lightened for them, and they will be plunged into destruction with deep regrets, sorrows and in despair therein.
We wronged them not, but they were the Zaalimoon (polytheists, wrongdoers).
And they will cry: ‘O Malik (Keeper of Hell)! Let your Lord make an end of us’  He will say: ‘Verily, you shall abide forever.’
Indeed We have brought the truth (Muhammad with the Quran) to you, but most of you have a hatred for the truth”
[al-Zukhruf 43:74-78] 
“Shall We then treat the Muslims (believers of Islamic Monotheism, doers of righteous deeds) like the Mujrimoon (criminals, polytheists and disbelievers)?
What is the matter with you? How judge you?”
[al-Qalam 68:34-35] 
“Or do those who earn evil deeds think that We shall hold them equal with those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah Islamic Monotheism) and do righteous good deeds, in their present life and after their death? Worst is the judgement that they make.
And Allah has created the heavens and the earth with truth, in order that each person may be recompensed what he has earned, and they will not be wronged”
[al-Jaathiyah 43:21-22]
“To Him is the return of all of you. The Promise of Allah is true. It is He Who begins the creation and then will repeat it, that He may reward with justice those who believed and did deeds of righteousness. But those who disbelieved will have a drink of boiling fluids and painful torment because they used to disbelieve”
[Yoonus 10:4]
 Whoever ponders these blessed verses will be certain that Allah is All-Wise, All-Knowing, Most Merciful, and He does not wrong any soul in the slightest. Your Lord is not unjust towards His slaves and

When you tell them that this is something for which there is no evidence (in sharee’ah) they tell you that this is something good and it wakes people up for Fajr.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    We do not know of any evidence that this happened at the time 
    of the Messenger  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and we do 
    not know of anyone among the Sahaabah who did that (reading Qu’raan out loud 
    on Fridays before Zuhr). Similarly the du’aa’s recited in a melodious over 
    loudspeakers before the adhaan for Fajr are also bid’ah, and every bid’ah is 
    a going-astray. It was proven that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of

    ours (Islam) that is not part of it will have it rejected.” (al-Bukhaari in
    al-Sulh, 2697; Muslim in al-Udhiyah, 1718)","Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah li’l-Buhooth al-‘Ilmiyyah wa’l-Ifta, 2/353"
26794,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26794,"The status of the hadeeth, “If I am someone’s mawla then ‘Ali is his mawla too” and its meaning","How sound is the hadeeth, “If I am someone’s mawla (friend) then ‘Ali is his mawla too”, and what does it mean?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    This hadeeth was narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 3713; Ibn Maajah, 
    121. There is some difference of opinion as to its authenticity. Al-Zayla’i 
    said in Taareekh al-Hidaayah 1/189: “How many ahaadeeth there are 
    which have many narrators and many isnaads, but they are da’eef (weak), such 
    as the hadeeth “If I am someone’s mawla then ‘Ali is his mawla too”.” 

    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: “As for his saying “If I 
    am someone’s mawla then ‘Ali is his mawla too”, this is not in the books of
    Saheeh, but it is one of the reports which were narrated by the 
    scholars and concerning whose authenticity the people disputed. It was 
    narrated that al-Bukhaari, Ibraaheem al-Harbi and a group of scholars of 
    hadeeth stated that it is not saheeh… As for the additional material, which 
    is the phrase ‘O Allaah, take as friends those who take him as a friend, and 
    take as enemies those who take him as an enemy,’ etc., this is undoubtedly 
    false.” Manhaaj al-Sunnah, 7/319. Al-Dhahabi said: “As for the 
    hadeeth, “If I am someone’s mawla then ‘Ali is his mawla too”, it has jayyid 
    isnaads.” It was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah 
    al-Saheehah, 1750, and he criticized those who said that it is da’eef 
    (weak). 

    The fact that this sentence has a saheeh isnaad going back to 
    the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) – if it is 
    saheeh – cannot under any circumstances be taken as evidence to support what 
    the extremists added to the hadeeth to prove that ‘Ali (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) takes precedence over all the other Sahaabah, or to 
    slander the Sahaabah and accuse them of usurping his rights. Shaykh al-Islam 
    [Ibn Taymiyah] referred to some of these additions and proved them to be 
    da’eef (weak) in ten places in Manhaaj al-Sunnah. 

    There is some difference of opinion as to the meaning of the 
    hadeeth. Whatever the meaning, it does not contradict that which is proven 
    and well-known from the saheeh ahaadeeth which state that the best of this 
    ummah is Abu Bakr and that he was the most deserving of being the khaleefah; 
    then he was followed by ‘Umar, then ‘Uthmaan – may Allaah be pleased with 
    them all. Proof of the virtue of a specific Sahaabi does not means that he 
    is the best of them, and that does not contradict the fact that Abu Bakr is 
    the best of them as is affirmed in the chapters on ‘aqeedah. 

    One of the meanings that have been suggested for this hadeeth 
    is as follows: 

    “It was said that its meaning is, ‘whomever I took as a 
    friend, ‘Ali will also take him as a friend as opposed to an enemy, and 
    whomever I used to love, ‘Ali will also love him.’ And it was said that its 
    meaning is, ‘whoever took me as a friend, ‘Ali will also take him as a 
    friend.’ This was quoted by al-Qaari’ from some of his scholars. Al-Jazari 
    said in al-Nihaayah: ‘The word mawla is frequently mentioned in the 
    hadeeth, and this is a name that is applied to many. It may refer to a lord, 
    to an owner, to a master, to a benefactor, to one who frees a slave, to a 
    supporter, to one who loves another, to a follower, to a neighbour, to a 
    cousin (son of paternal uncle), to an ally, to an in-law, to a slave, to a 
    freed slave, to one to whom one has done a favour. Most of these meanings 
    are referred to in various ahaadeeth, so it is to be understand in the 
    manner implied by the context of the hadeeth in which it is mentioned. 
    Everyone who is in charge of some matter or is taking care of it is the 
    mawla of that thing. The word mawla mentioned in this hadeeth may refer to 
    most of the meanings indicated above. Al-Shaafa’i (may Allaah have mercy on 
    him) said: What is meant by that is the bonds of Islam, as in the aayah 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    ‘That is because Allaah is the Mawlaa (Lord, Master, 
    Helper, Protector) of those who believe, and the disbelievers have no Mawlaa 
    (lord, master, helper, protector)’

    [Muhammad 47:11]
Al-Teebi said: it is 
    incorrect to interpret the mawla as referring to the imam who conducts the 
    affairs of the believers, because the only person who was in charge of the 
    Muslims’ affairs during the lifetime of the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) was the Prophet himself and no one else, so 
    the word mawla must be interpreted as referring to love, the bonds of Islam 
    and so on.”

26799,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/26799,Using lipstick,Is it allowed to put lipstick only for your husband. Some say that lipstick contains pig fat. Is it true? In such a case are we allowed to apply lipstick? Please advise.,,,"Praise be to Allah.The basic principle is that anything that is used for adornment and beautification is permissible. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“He it is Who created for you all that is on earth” [Al-Baqarah 2:29]
That may be mustahabb if the intention is to beautify yourself for your husband, because this is something that is prescribed in sharee’ah. 
But this is subject to the condition that nothing haram is involved, such as adorning yourself for non-mahram men to whom it is not permissible to show your beauty. It is also subject to the condition that it does not contain any substance that may harm the body or that is impure such as pig fat. In that case it is haram, because we are forbidden to do things that will harm us, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “there should be no harming or reciprocating harm.” 
Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said:  
There is nothing wrong with using lipstick because the basic principle is that things are permissible until it is made clear that they are haram… But if it becomes clear that it is harmful to the lips, that it dries them out and makes them lose their moisture, then in this case it is not allowed. I have been told that it may cause the lips crack. If that is proven then we are forbidden to do things that harm us. Fatawa Manaar al-Islam, 3/831 
Dr Wajeeh Zayn al-‘Aabideen wrote an article in al-Wa’i al-Islami magazine about the harm that the cosmetics which are widely used by women nowadays may cause. In this article he said: 
Lipstick may cause swelling of the lips or drying and cracking of the thin skin of the lips, because it removes the protective layer of the lips. 
Quoted from Zeenat al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah by Shaykh ‘Abd-Allah al-Fawzaan, p. 51 
So Muslim women should make sure, before using any of the commonly-used cosmetics, that it will not cause any damage to her body.
