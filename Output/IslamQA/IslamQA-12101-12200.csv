12103,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12103,Did the Prophet appoint ‘Ali as khaleefah?,"What is the ruling on people who claim that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) appointed ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him) as khaleefah, and say that the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) conspired against him?",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    This opinion is not known among any of the Muslim groups 
    apart from the Shi’ah, and it is a false view which has no basis in the 
    ahaadeeth that have been proven from the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him). On the contrary, a great deal of evidence 
    shows that the khaleefah after the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) was Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq (may Allaah be pleased with him 
    and with all the companions of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him)). But the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) did not state that clearly and he did not appoint him in any 
    definitive sense; rather he gave commands which indicated that, when he told 
    him to lead the people in prayer when he (the Prophet  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him)) was sick, and when he told him about the 
    leadership of the Muslim community after his death, saying, “Allaah and the 
    believers will only accept Abu Bakr.” Hence the Sahaabah (may Allaah be 
    pleased with them) gave their allegiance (bay’ah) to Abu Bakr and they were 
    unanimously agreed that Abu Bakr was the best among them. It was reported in 
    the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Sahaabah 
    (may Allaah be pleased with them) used to say during the Prophet’s life: 
    “The best of this ummah after its Prophet is Abu Bakr, then ‘Umar, then 
    ‘Uthmaan,” and the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    approved of their saying that. Mutawaatir reports from ‘Ali (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him) show that he used to say, “The best of this ummah after 
    its Prophet is Abu Bakr then ‘Umar.” And he (may Allaah be pleased with him) 
    used to say, “No one is brought to me who prefers me over them, but I will 
    whip him with the hadd punishment for telling lies.” He never claimed that 
    he was the best of this ummah, or that the Messenger of Allaah  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had appointed him as khaleefah. He 
    never said that the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) had wronged 
    him and taken away his rights. When Faatimah (may Allaah be pleased with 
    her) died he gave a second pledge of allegiance (bay’ah) to Abu Bakr, as 
    confirmation of his first pledge and to demonstrate to the people that he 
    was with the jamaa’ah (the main group of Muslims) and that he had no 
    reservations in his heart against giving his allegiance to Abu Bakr (may 
    Allaah be pleased with them all). When ‘Umar was stabbed, he appointed six 
    of those whom the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    had testified were guaranteed Paradise, for them to appoint one of their 
    number as ‘Umar’s successor; among these six was ‘Ali, who never denounced 
    ‘Umar, either whilst he was still alive or after his death. ‘Ali did not say 
    that he was more entitled than any of them to be khaleefah, so how can 
    anyone have the right to tell lies about the Messenger of Allaah  (peace 
    and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and say that he appointed ‘Ali as 
    khaleefah? ‘Ali himself never made any such claim, and none of the Sahaabah 
    claimed that for him. Rather they were unanimously agreed that the caliphate 
    of Abu Bakr, ‘Umar and ‘Uthmaan was valid; ‘Ali acknowledged that and he 
    cooperated with all of them in jihad, shoora (consultation), etc. Moreover, 
    the Muslims after the Sahaabah were agreed upon that which the Sahaabah had 
    been agreed on. After all this, it is not permissible for anyone or for any 
    group, Shi’ah or others, to claim that ‘Ali was the appointed successor, or 
    that the caliphate before him was false. Similarly, no one has the right to 
    say that the Sahaabah wronged ‘Ali and took away his rights. Rather this is 
    the falsest of falsehoods, and it is thinking badly of the Companions of the 
    Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), 
    including ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him and with them all). 

    Allaah has protected the ummah of Muhammad  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) and kept it from agreeing on misguidance. 
    It was narrated in a saheeh report in many ahaadeeth that the Prophet  
    (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “A group of my ummah will 
    continue to adhere to the truth and to prevail.” It is impossible that the 
    noblest generation of this ummah could agree on falsehood, supposedly the 
    caliphate of Abu Bakr, ‘Umar and ‘Uthmaan. No one says this who believes in 
    Allaah and the Last Day, and no one says this who has the slightest insight 
    into the rulings of Islam.","From the fatwas of Shaykh Ibn Baaz, from Kitaab Fataawa Islaamiyyah, 1/46"
12107,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12107,"The Hadeeth, “If you see poverty coming to you then say, ‘Welcome, O sign of the righteous’”","How sound is the hadeeth (prophetic narration), “Allah revealed to one of His prophets, ‘If you see poverty coming to you then say, Welcome, O sign of the righteous, and if you see richness coming to you, then say, A sin whose punishment has been hastened’”?",,,"Praise be to Allah.This hadeeth was narrated by al-Daylami in Musnad al-Firdaws – as al-Hafiz al-‘Iraqi said – from the report of Makhool from Abu’l-Darda. It is a da’eef (weak) hadeeth, for Makhool did not hear anything from Abu’l-Darda. 
See Takhreej Ihya ‘Uloom al-Deen, 4/191. 
It was also narrated by Abu Na’eem in al-Hilyah (6/5) from the report of Mujahid from Ka’b al-Ahbar. 
And he narrated it in 6/37 from the report of Qutadah from Ka’b al-Ahbaar. 
Both isnads (chains of narration) include Ishaq ibn Bishr al-Kahili, who is matrook [i.e., his hadeeth is not accepted]. Abu Zar’ah said: he used to tell lies.  
Al-Daraqutni said he is kaththab matrook (i.e., a liar whose hadeeth is not to be accepted). Al-Azdi said: his hadeeth is to be rejected and is not valid, and he was accused of lying. Ibn Hibban said: he used to fabricate hadeeth and attribute them to trustworthy narrators (thiqat); his hadeeth should not be written down except by way of amusing oneself with something weird. 
See al-Jarh wa’l-Ta’deel, 2/214; al-Du’afa wa’l-Matrookeen by Ibn al-Jawzi, 1/100. 
He is one of the storytellers and time-wasters. Al-Thahabi said in his biography of him: the shaykh, the scholar, the storyteller, the weak narrator (da’eef), the time-waster, Abu Hudhayfah Ishaq ibn Bishr ibn Muhammad ibn ‘Abd-Allah ibn Salim al-Hashimi, whose teacher was al-Bukhari the author of al-Mubtada, which is a well known book in two volumes. Ibn Jareer and others narrated from him, and in it he spoke of weird and disastrous things.

12110,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12110,Islamic unity,How does Islam encourage unity?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Mankind was one nation, believing in Tawheed, 
          then they differed. Some of them believed and some disbelieved. So Allaah 
          sent the Prophets with glad tidings and warnings, so whoever believes 
          will enter Paradise and whoever disbelieves will enter Hell. The conflict 
          is still going on between belief and disbelief, truth and falsehood, 
          and will continue until Allaah inherits the earth and everyone on it.  
          
Islam is the religion for all of mankind, 
          and Allaah has commanded us to convey it to all people. This can only 
          be achieved if we are strong, and strength is based on faith and unity. 
          Hence Allaah has commanded all the believers to adhere to His religion 
          and to be united, and not to be divided. Allaah says (interpretation 
          of the meaning):  
“And hold fast, all of you together, 
          to the Rope of Allaah (i.e. this Qur’aan), and be not divided among 
          yourselves 
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:103]  
Division, differences and disputes are the 
          cause of the ummah’s defeat, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  
          
“And obey Allaah and His Messenger, 
          and do not dispute (with one another) lest you lose courage and your 
          strength departs, and be patient. Surely, Allaah is with those who are 
          As-Saabiroon (the patient)” 
[al-Anfaal 8:46]  
Unity and coming together are among the basic 
          principles of Islam, and there are many aspects of unity in Islam, such 
          as One Lord, one Book, one Prophet, one religion, one qiblah, one ummah.  
          
In order to achieve the unity of the ummah, 
          Islam urges us to adhere to the jamaa’ah (the group which follows the 
          Qur’aan and Sunnah). The Messenger 
          
          (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) explained that the hand 
          of Allaah is with the jamaa’ah, and that whoever deviates from that 
          will be in Hell. Allaah has enjoined coming together for all acts of 
          worship in order to achieve this unity. Allaah addresses the ummah as 
          one group in all rulings to indicate that they are one ummah, like one 
          body. There is no difference between them; the commands and prohibitions 
          are addressed to all.  
In the context of worship, Allaah says (interpretation 
          of the meaning):   
“Worship Allaah and join none with 
          Him (in worship) 
[al-Nisaa’ 4:36]  
And He enjoins them all to establish regular 
          prayer:  
“Guard strictly (five obligatory) 
          As-Salawaat (the prayers) especially the middle Salaah (i.e. the 
          best prayer - ‘Asr). And stand before Allaah with obedience” 
[al-Baqarah 2:238]  
Concerning zakaah, Allaah commands them all, 
          as He says (interpretation of the meaning):  
“And perform As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as-Salaah), 
          and give Zakaah” 
[al-Baqarah 2:43]  
Concerning fasting, He says (interpretation 
          of the meaning):  
“O you who believe! Observing As-Sawm 
          (the fasting) is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before 
          you, that you may become Al-Muttaqoon (the pious)” 
[al-Baqarah 2:183]  
Concerning Hajj, Allaah says (interpretation 
          of the meaning):  
“And Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah) 
          to the House (Ka‘bah) is a duty that mankind owes to Allaah, those who 
          can afford the expenses (for one’s conveyance, provision and residence)” 
          
[Aal ‘Imraan 3:97]  
Concerning jihaad, Allaah says (interpretation 
          of the meaning):  
“And strive hard in Allaah’s Cause as you ought to 
          strive (with sincerity and with all your efforts that His Name should 
          be superior)”[al-Hajj 22:78]  
Islam regards all people as equal before the 
          laws of Allaah. Black and white, Arab and non-Arab, male and female, 
          rich and poor – Islam brings them all together and addresses its commands 
          and prohibitions to them all. So whoever obeys Allaah and His Messenger 
          will enter Paradise and whoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger will 
          enter Hell, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):  
“Whosoever does righteous good deed, 
          it is for (the benefit of) his ownself; and whosoever does evil, it 
          is against his ownself. And your Lord is not at all unjust to (His) 
          slaves”

12118,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12118,Abortion of physically deformed foetus,Is it permissible to abort the foetus after medical tests have shown that it is physically deformed?,,,"Praise be to Allah.There are many causes of deformity of the foetus, many of which could be avoided; one could protect oneself from them or reduce their effects. Islam and medicine both urge people to avoid the causes of disease and to protect themselves against it as much as possible. The teachings of Islam urge us to protect our health and to protect the foetus from many diseases which are caused by ignoring the teachings of Islam and falling into sin such as zinaa (unlawful sexual relationships), drinking alcohol, smoking, and taking drugs. Modern medicine also warns mothers of the imminent danger of taking some medications, or being exposed to x-rays or gamma rays, especially in the early days of pregnancy. 
 
If it is proven in a definitive fashion, beyond any doubt, by a trustworthy medical committee, that the foetus is deformed, and that this deformity cannot be treated by the specialists, then in my view it is permissible to abort it, in view of the difficulties it would face in life and the hardship this would present to the parents, and the burdens and responsibilities of care it would place on the society. These considerations and others prompted the Islamic Fiqh Committee of the Muslim World League in its 12
th conference held in Makkah on 15 Rajab 1410 AH (10/2/1990 CE), to issue the statement that “it is permissible to abort a foetus which is deformed in the manner mentioned above, with the consent of the parents and within the first 120 days from the beginning of the pregnancy.” 
The decision of the committee was in accordance with the fatwa of the Standing Committee for Academic Research and Issuing Fatwas in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, no. 2484, issued on 16/7/1399 AH. 
But if the soul has been breathed into the foetus and it has completed 120 days, then it is not permissible to abort it, no matter what the deformity, unless continuation of the pregnancy would put the mother’s life in danger. This is because after the soul has been breathed into the foetus, it is considered to be a person who must be protected, regardless of whether it is free of disease or not, and regardless of whether there is hope of recovery or not. That is because Allah has a reason for everything that He creates, which many people do not know, and He knows best what is right for His creation, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Should not He Who has created know? And He is the Most Kind and Courteous (to His slaves), All Aware (of everything).
[al-Mulk 67:14] 
In the birth of these deformed children there is a lesson for those who are of sound health, and it teaches us of the power of Allah Who shows His creation the manifestations of His might and the wonders that He has created. Killing and aborting them is a purely materialistic view which pays no attention to matters of religion and morals. Perhaps the existence of these deformities will make people more humble and submissive towards their Lord, and make them bear them with patience, seeking a great reward from Him. 
Physical deformity is something that Allah has decreed for some of His slaves. Whoever bears that with patience will attain victory. This is something that happens and has always happened throughout history, but unfortunately studies indicate that the rate of physical deformity is increasing, as the result of pollution of the environment and the increase of harmful rays in the atmosphere, which was previously unknown. 
It is by the mercy of Allah that many deformed foetuses are miscarried or die before they are born. 
The Muslim woman and the Muslim family must bear with patience whatever happens to them, and seek the reward for that with Allah.
And Allah knows best.","From Ahkaam al-Janeen fi’l-Fiqh al-Islami, by ‘Umar ibn Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem Ghaanim"

Among those which have been narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) are adhkaar for getting up from sleep, du`as for morning and evening, and when going to sleep. One of the du`as which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught us to say in the morning and evening is as follows: 
“Reciting ‘Qul Huwa Allahu Ahad’ and al-Mi’wadhatayn [the last two soorahs of the Quran] three times in the evening and in the morning will protect you against everything.”

I seek refuge with You from all the evil I have done. I acknowledge before You all the blessings You have bestowed upon me, and I confess to You all my sins. So I entreat You to forgive my sins, for nobody can forgive sins except You.).” He [the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)] said: Whoever says this during the day, believing in it with certainty, then dies on that day before evening comes, will be one of the people of Paradise, and whoever says it at night, believing in it with certainty, then dies on that night before morning comes, will be one of the people of Paradise.”
(Narrated by al-Bukhari, al-Da’waat, 6306) 
It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said:
“The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Whoever says morning and evening, Subhaan Allah wa bihamdih (Glory and praise be to Allah)’ one hundred times, no one will come on the Day of Resurrection with anything better than him, except for one who said the same as he said, or who said more.’(Narrated by Muslim, al-Dhikr wa’l-du`a, 2692) 
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If a person says, every day in the morning and every night in the evening, ‘Bismillaah alladhi laa yadurru ma’a ismihi shay’un fi’l-ardi wa laa fi’l-sama’ wa Huwa al-Samee’ al-‘Aleem (In the name of Allah with Whose name nothing can cause harm on earth or in heaven, and He is the All-Seeing, the All-Knowing)’, three times, nothing will harm him.”

Should you marry that person even if you don't feel enthusiastic about marrying them? Also, I only sat with the brother once. Could my lack of enthusiasm be do to this fact?",,,"Praise be to Allah.The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If there comes to you one with whose religious commitment and character you are pleased, then marry (your female relative) to him.” And he said, “Seek the one who is religious.” What is addressed to men includes women too. 
When you find a young man whose religious commitment, character and attitude you are pleased with, then you have to accept him as a husband. What will help a girl to do that is to ask about this man from those who know him well, because during short visits, and especially when one is seeking to get married, people are usually on their best behaviour and one sees little of a person’s true nature and character.

A girl may also feel somewhat afraid when thinking of marriage to a person because it is such a life-changing matter. But this fear should not stop you from agreeing if he is religious and of good character. 
We would also draw your attention to the issue of your sitting with this person, which you mentioned at the beginning of your question. If the betrothed couplesit together in the presence of someone who will ensure that there is no khulwah [being alone together], and the woman wears hijaab as she wears for prayer (i.e., covering everything except the hands and face), for a length of time which is sufficient for both parties to make a decision, this is correct and is what is prescribed in Islam; if it is anything other than that, then beware…",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
12187,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12187,Is it permissible for the one who is doing Qiraan to change his intention to Ifraad?,What is the ruling on one who changes his mind and starts to recite  Talbiyah for Hajj with the intention now of doing Hajj only (Hajj al-Ifraad) after passing the Meeqaat?,,,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz answered a question concerning the ruling on one who intends to do Hajj as Tamattu’ then after passing the Meeqaat he changes his mind and starts to recite Talbiyah with the intention of doing Hajj al-Ifraad – does he have to offer the sacrifice? 
He said: “It depends. If his intention before reaching the Meeqaat had been to do Tamattu’, then after reaching the Meeqaat he changed his intention and entered ihraam for Hajj only [Ifraad], there is nothing wrong with that and he does not have to offer the fidyah (penalty). But if he had recited the Talbiyah with the intention of doing ‘Umrah and Hajj together from the Meeqaat or from before the Meeqaat, then he wanted to make it Hajj only, he cannot do that, but there is nothing to stop him making it ‘Umrah, but he cannot make it Hajj. Qiraan cannot be changed to Hajj (ifraad) but it can be changed to ‘Umrah because that is easier for the believer and because that is what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded.  So if a person enters the state of ihraam with the intention of doing ‘Umrah and Hajj together (Qiraan) from the Meeqaat, then he decides to make it Hajj only, he cannot do that but he can change it to ‘Umrah only, which is better for him. So he can do Tawaaf and Sa’ee, then cut his hair and exit the state of ihraam, then he can enter ihraam for Hajj, and thus he will be doing Tamattu’.”",Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz
12191,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12191,What is the meaning of the phrase “they (think to) deceive Allaah” in the aayah from Soorat al-Baqarah?,"What is the tafsir of the verse in the beginning of Sura-t-ul Baqarah that is translated to mean ""they think to fool Allah and those who Believe"".  How can a person try to fool Allah, The Glorious and Exalted?

also, do you have any advice for an american who would like to study islam overseas?",,,"Praise be to Allah. Ibn 
          Katheer said in his tafseer of this aayah: 
“ ‘they 
          (think to) deceive Allaah and those who believe’ [al-Baqarah 2:9 – interpretation 
          of the meaning] means, by 
          their making an outward show of faith whilst inwardly they conceal kufr. 
          They think in their ignorance that they can deceive Allaah in this way, 
          and that this will benefit them with Him. They think that they can fool 
          Him as they fooled some of the believers, as Allaah says (interpretation 
          of the meaning): 
“On the Day when Allaah will resurrect them all together (for their 
          account); then they will swear to Him as they swear to you (O Muslims). 
          And they think that they have something (to stand upon). Verily, they 
          are liars!” [al-Mujaadilah 58:18] 
Hence Allaah responds 
          to their belief by saying (interpretation of the meaning): 
“while they only deceive themselves, and perceive (it) not!” 
[al-Baqarah 2:9] 
i.e., they are not 
          deceiving anyone by their actions but themselves, but they do not perceive 
          that in themselves. This is like the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): 
          
“Verily, the hypocrites seek to deceive Allaah, but it is He Who deceives 
          them” [al-Nisaa’ 4:142]
We advise the American who wants to learn about Islam to be fair-minded and 
          free from whims and desires. He should beware of the ways in which the 
          enemies of Islam try to distort Islam. He should strive to learn about 
          Islam from its pure sources and not from the sects who give a bad image 
          of Islam by their bid’ah and innovations, like the Qadiaanis (Ahmadis), 
          Shi’ah and Sufis, etc. These groups have distorted the message of Islam 
          with their innovations, so he should not regard their actions and words 
          as being Islam. We ask Allaah to guide him.",Shaykh Sa’d al-Humayd
12193,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12193,Is One Rewarded for Preparing the Dead for Burial?,What are the rewards for preparing a dead body for burial?,"The one who prays the funeral prayer will have one Qirat (a huge mountain) of reward, and the one who accompanies the funeral procession to the burial will have two Qirats. There is no specific reward for washing the deceased. For the one who seeks reward by preparing the body we hope that there will be even more reward.",,"Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Sa`d Al-Humayd (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
“We do not know of any authentic evidence to indicate the amount of reward earned by the one who prepares the deceased for burial, but the Bounty of Allah is vast.”
The one who prays (the funeral prayer) for the deceased will have one Qirat of reward (a Qirat is equivalent to the size of Mount Uhud), and the one who accompanies the funeral procession to the burial will have two Qirats . For the one who seeks reward by preparing the body we hope that there will be even more reward.” 
Shaykh `Abd Al-Karim Al-Khudayr (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 
“Washing the deceased is Fard Kifayah (i.e., a communal obligation, whereby if some members of the community undertake this duty, the rest are free from sin, but if no one does it, all will be sinful), so there is no specific reward. However, if sufficient people do the job, it becomes Sunnah for the rest. There are no reports which describe a specific reward, but there will be a reward for it because it is an obligatory duty, and not doing it is a sin.”

12199,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/12199,Should he obey his parents or follow the Sunnah?,"the prophets sunna are very important, the example that i allways hear is that the fard are like the wall of the house and the sunnas are like the furniture, so my question is that if your parents object to u wearing sunna clothing, eating the sunna way slepping the sunna ect. then should i give these sunns up to please my parents.",,,"Praise be to Allah.He should try to convince his parents and explain to them the Sunnah of dressing, eating, sleeping, etc. If both or one of them still persist, then he can obey them with regard to matters of dress, eating and sleeping that do not go against any text or clear evidence (daleel), because the basic principle regarding clothing etc. is that it is permissible (unless there is evidence to the contrary) and it is usually based on custom, because these are matters of nature or tradition which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and others used to do before Islam. So there is nothing wrong with a Muslim wearing the clothes that people in his country wear, or eating the food that they eat, or going along with them in matters which do not go against any clear text, especially if his parents ask him to do that. 
Shaykh Ibn Jibreen 
But if they tell him to do something which goes against the sharee’ah with regard to clothing, for example, such as letting one’s garments hang below the ankles, or they tell him to eat with his left hand, for example, then he should not obey them in that, but he should still be kind towards them.And Allaah knows best.",Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid
