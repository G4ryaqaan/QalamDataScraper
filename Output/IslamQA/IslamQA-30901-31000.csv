30901,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/30901,A righteous young man is overwhelmed with worry and anxiety. What is the remedy?,"There is a young man who is suffering from psychological distress, depression and worry, and he does not know what is the cause. Please note that he prays qiyaam al-layl and fasts a great deal, and he prays (the five daily prayers), but sometimes he sleeps and misses a prayer. He attends Islamic classes and reads books, and he is trying to memorize the Quran, and he listens to Islamic tapes. Despite that he is suffering from depression and worry. Please also note that this young man loves his paternal aunt a great deal and was always helping her, and the aunt is in good health.
I hope that you will answer me as soon as possible so that this young man can be helped. Thank you very much.",,,"Praise be to Allah.We are happy to see your concern for this young man and your eagerness to find an effective remedy to offer him in the hope that Allah will benefit him thereby. By doing that you are strengthening the ties of Islamic brotherhood. We hope that Allah will reward you for that. 
You have explained this young man’s situation, and we will reply in the following points: 
1 – In this dunya (this world – the name in Arabic carries connotations both of that which is close and that which is base and vile), a man’s life is not consistent, rather his circumstances will vary between that which he likes and that which he does not like.  The wise man, when he thinks about this world, will realize that he needs to develop an optimistic outlook and put an end to worries and distress that could disturb him and cause him stress.  
What the Shaytaan wants to do is to cause the Muslim grief and stress. Being introverted and thinking constantly about pain and sorrow gives the Shaytaan a great opportunity and may cause the worries and stress to multiply. Looking forward to a happy life and being optimistic is one of the means of feeling content and at peace. It is known that this world is a mixture of ease and hardship, joy and sorrow, hope and pain, so why should a person help the dark side to prevail over the bright side? 
Wisdom dictates that if a man cannot make optimism prevail, then at the very least he should think in a balanced and objective manner. 
Secondly: 
Feelings of stress and that life is too hard do not control a man's mind unless there are reasons that provoke these kinds of feelings. Rather they are indicative that the relationship between a person and his Lord is not sound. The more a man turns to Allah and focuses on Him, the more he will feel a sense of peace and comfort, to an extent that no one knows except Allah. Hence those who know Allah, are close to Him and fear Him are the happiest of people, to such an extent that one of them said, in a well known expression: “If the kings and the sons of kings knew what joy we have, they would fight us for it with the sword.” This is also what is expressed in the Quran, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):
“Whoever works righteousness — whether male or female — while he (or she) is a true believer (of Islamic Monotheism) verily, to him We will give a good life (in this world with respect, contentment and lawful provision), and We shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion to the best of what they used to do (i.e. Paradise in the Hereafter)” [al-Nahl 16:97]
But feeling stressed is a kind of wake-up call that alerts a person to check on his relationship with his Lord, because sins may have the effect of making a person feel scattered and unfocused. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“But whosoever turns away from My Reminder (i.e. neither believes in this Quran nor acts on its teachings) verily, for him is a life of hardship, and We shall raise him up blind on the Day of Resurrection” [Ta-Ha 20:124]
There is a great deal of goodness in the young man whom you are asking about, for he is a person who is keen to seek knowledge, and he does naafil acts of worship such as fasting, and he upholds ties of kinship with his aunt. However you must draw his attention to the fact that he has to check on his relationship with Allah, for there may be some sin that is preventing him from achieving this sense of happiness, some sin that he has committed with regard to the rights of Allah or the rights of others. So encourage him to repent and seek forgiveness a great deal, especially since you said that he sometimes sleeps and misses the prayer – this is a serious matter although many people take it lightly. 
Thirdly: 
It may be that this test of this person through disasters and calamities is something that has been decreed by Allah for him in order to raise him in status, if he persists in obeying what Allah has commanded, which is to be patient and accept whatever Allah decrees. Everything that Allah decrees for a believer is good for him and his affairs, both spiritual and worldly. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “How wonderful is the affair of the believer, for all his affairs are good, and that applies to no one except a believer. If something good happens to him, he gives thanks for it and that is good for him, and if something bad happens to him, he bears it with patience, and that is also good for him.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2999) 
If something bad happens to a believer, he either bears it with patience or panics. If he is patient he earns a great reward and accepts the will and decree of Allah, because he knows that it comes from Allah, so he feels content with it and accepts it. So what reason is there to panic and feel stressed? 
On the contrary, if he is not patient and he reacts to what befalls him of sin with panic and anger, and worry and stress, he will lose the reward that Allah has promised to those who are patient. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
“Only those who are patient shall receive their reward in full, without reckoning” [al-Zumar 39:10]
Fourthly: 
He should sincerely turn towards Allah and call upon Him (du’a’), beseeching Him to relieve him of this waswaas (whispers from the Shaytaan) and seeking refuge in Him a great deal from the accursed Shaytaan. For it annoys the Shaytaan to see a believing slave feeling peace of mind and contentment, so he whispers to him to distract him from that and make him fearful and confused.  
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught us a du’aa’ by which we may ward off worries and distress. Ahmad (3528) narrated that ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ood said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:
“There is no-one who is afflicted by distress and grief, and says: ‘Allahumma inni ‘abduka ibn ‘abdika ibn amatija naasyati bi yadika, maada fiyya hukmuka, ‘adlun fiyya qadaa’uka. As’aluka bi kulli ismin huwa laka sammayta bihi nafsaka aw anzaltahu fi kitaabika aw ‘allamtahu ahadan min khalqika aw ista’tharta bihi fi ‘ilm il-ghayb ‘indaka an taj’al al-Qurana rabee’ qalbi wa noor sadri wa jalaa’ huzni wa dhihaab hammi (O Allah, I am Your slave, son of Your slave, son of Your maidservant; my forelock is in Your hand, Your command over me is forever executed and Your decree over me is just. I ask You by every name belonging to You which You have named Yourself with, or revealed in Your Book, or You taught to any of Your creation, or You have preserved in the knowledge of the Unseen with You, that You make the Quran the life of my heart and the light of my breast, and a departure for my sorrow and a release for my anxiety),’ but Allah will take away his distress and grief, and replace it with joy.” He was asked: “O Messenger of Allah, should we learn this?” He said: “Of course; everyone who hears it should learn it.” 
(Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 199) 
Fifthly: 
Try to suggest that he change something in his daily routine, to allow himself the opportunity to do different kinds of permissible things that will relieve him of boredom and renew his energy. There is nothing wrong with travelling for leisure purposes or to relax, so long he does not go to extremes. Even better than that is if he can travel for the purpose of ‘Umrah and to visit the Prophet’s mosque, because a change of scene can be very beneficial. 
Sixthly: 
He has to keep away from places that he feels make his worry and distress worse, or that stir these feeling up again. He should avoid reading novels that tell sad stories, and he should try not to sit with people who are worried and distressed, even if his intention is to console them.  On the contrary, he should try to read useful books that will take him away from these worries. If he feels stressed and upset, he should not isolate himself or think constantly about his problems in this situation.  
Finally: 
Our advice to this young man is that he should raise his head and look forward, and view the future with optimism and the certainty that he will succeed. I say to him: You have a great deal of potential for success and high achievement, and a lot is to be expected of someone like you. We hope that these troubles and worries will be lifted from you. May Allah make things easy for you and relieve you of your distress and worry. 
And Allah knows best.",Islam Q&A
30905,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/30905,To whom is the book Nahj al-Balaaghah attributed?,I would like to ask how authentic the book Nahj al-Balaagha is and what your opinion of it is?,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    The book Nahj al-Balaaghah is one of the books that 
    are attributed to Ameer al-Mu’mineen ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allah be 
    pleased with him), but it contains many things concerning which those who 
    claim to be Muslims have disputed. Following the great scientific principle 
    which was followed by the imams of Islam in obedience to the shar’i command 
    to verify reports, we have no choice but to refer to the scholars and 
    specialists to check on the veracity of the things that are attributed to 
    ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him), because what is narrated from the 
    Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) has an effect on sharee’ah, 
    especially in the case of someone like Ameer al-Mu’mineen ‘Ali (may Allaah 
    be pleased with him), concerning whom some people have exaggerated or fallen 
    short, but Allaah guided the Ahl al-Sunnah to follow a middle course. 

    By referring to the words of the scholars concerning this 
    book and comparing its contents with what has been proven with saheeh 
    isnaads from ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him), it becomes clear that 
    there is material in this book that contradicts what was proven from him 
    (may Allaah be pleased with him). So we should look at what some of these 
    great scholars have said: 

    Imaam al-Dhahabi (may Allaah be pleased with him) said in his 
    biography of al-Murtada ‘Ali ibn Husayn ibn Moosa al-Moosawi (d. 436 AH): I 
    said, he was the compiler of the book Nahj al-Balaaghah which is attributed 
    to Imam ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him), but the reports contained 
    therein have are no isnaads. Some of it is false and some of it is true, but 
    it contains some frabricated reports of things that the Imam would never 
    have said. But who is the fair-minded man who would look at it in an 
    objective manner?! It was said that it was compiled by his brother Shareef 
    al-Radiy. It includes slander against the companions of the Messenger of 
    Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him); we seek refuge with 
    Allaah from knowledge that is of no benefit.

    Siyar A’laam al-Nubala’, 17/589 

    Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    said: “Most of the khutab (sermons) that the author of Nahj al-Balaaghah 
    includes in his book are lies against ‘Ali. ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with 
    him) is too noble and too worthy to have uttered such words. But these 
    people fabricated lies and thought that they were praise, but they are 
    neither truth nor praise. Whoever says that the words of ‘Ali or any other 
    human being are above the words of any other created being is mistaken, for 
    the words of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) 
    are above his words, and both of them are created beings. Moreover the 
    correct meanings that are to be found in the words of ‘Ali are to be found 
    in the words of others, but the author of Nahj al-Balaaghah and his 
    ilk took many of the things that people say and made them the words of ‘Ali. 
    There are some words narrated from ‘Ali that he did say, and some of them 
    are true words that would have been befitting for him to say, but in fact 
    they are the words of others. Hence in Kalaam al-Bayaan wa’l-Tabyeen 
    by al-Haafiz and in other books there are words narrated from people other 
    than ‘Ali and the author of Nahj al-Balaaghah attributed them to 
    ‘Ali. If these sermons which were transmitted in Nahj al-Balaaghah 
    were really spoken by ‘Ali, they would have been found in other books that 
    existed before this book was written, and they would have been narrated from 
    ‘Ali with isnaads and otherwise. It is known from those who are well versed 
    in the study of narrations that many of them (these sermons) – indeed most 
    of them – were unknown before this, therefore it may be concluded that they 
    are fabrications. So the narrator should state in which book they are 
    mentioned, who narrated it from ‘Ali, and what its isnaad is. Otherwise, 
    anybody could say something and claim that it was said by ‘Ali. Those who 
    are well-versed in the knowledge of the hadeeth scholars and of reports and 
    isnaads and are able to tell what is sound and what is not sound would know 
    that these people who transmitted reports from ‘Ali are the least likely 
    people to know about reports and be able to distinguish the sound from the 
    unsound.

    Manhaaj al-Sunnah al-Nabawiyyah, 
    8/55. 

    Other scholars who pointed out the lies in this book was 
    al-Khateeb al-Baghdaadi, in al-Jaami’ li Akhlaaq al-Raawi wa Adaab 
    al-Saami’, 2.161; al-Qaadi Ibn Khalkaan; al-Safadi, and others. The 
    things that have been said against it may be summarized in the following 
    points: 

    1.There are seven generations of 
    narrators between ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him) and the author of 
    this book, and he did not mention any name whatsoever. Hence we cannot 
    accept his words without an isnaad. 

    2.If these narrators are 
    mentioned, it is essential to research about them and find out whether they 
    are trustworthy.

    3.The fact that most of these 
    sermons did not exist before this book was written indicates that they were 
    fabricated.

    4.Al-Murtada – the author of the 
    book – was not one of the scholars of reports, rather he was one of those 
    whose religious commitment and competence were debatable.

    5.The slander that it contains 
    against the leading Sahaabah is sufficient to count it as false.

    6.The insults and slander that it 
    contains are not the characteristics of the believers, let alone their 
    leaders such as ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him).

    7.It contains contradictions and 
    clumsy expressions from which it may be known for certain that it was not 
    produced by one who was prominent in eloquence and fluency.

    8.The fact that the Raafidah 
    accept it and are certain that it is as true as the Qur’aan, despite all 
    these objections, indicates that they do not pay attention to verifying 
    sources and ensuring that they are sound with regard to the matters of their 
    religion.

     Based on the above, it is clear that this book cannot be 
    attributed to ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him), therefore nothing in it 
    can be used as evidence in matters of sharee’ah, no matter what the issue 
    is. But whoever reads it in order to find out what it contains of eloquence, 
    the ruling is the same as that on all other books on Arabic language, 
    without attributing its contents to Ameer al-Mu’mineen ‘Ali (may Allaah be 
    pleased with him).
