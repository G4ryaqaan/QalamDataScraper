Obligatory fasting 


Mustahabb (encouraged) fasting 


Makruh (disliked) fasting 


Forbidden fasts 


Permissible fasts","Praise be to Allah.Types of fasting in Islam
The types of fasting in Islam are five: obligatory (wajib), forbidden (muharram), encouraged (mustahabb), disliked (makruh) and permissible (mubah). These five rulings have been narrated with regard to fasting. We cannot list everything that comes under each of these rulings, but we will mention what we can. 
Obligatory fasting 
·        The Ramadan fast
·        Making up missed Ramadan fasts
·        Expiatory fasts (expiation for accidental killing, expiation for zihar (a form of jahili divorce), expiation for having intercourse during the day in Ramadan, and expiation for breaking an oath)
·        Fasting for the pilgrim who does tamattu’ in Hajj if he does not have a sacrificial animal. “and whosoever performs the ‘Umrah in the months of Hajj, before (performing) the Hajj, (i.e. Hajj-at-Tamattu‘ and Al-Qiran), he must slaughter a Hady such as he can afford, but if he cannot afford it, he should observe Sawm (fasts) three days during the Hajj and seven days after his return (to his home)” [al-Baqarah 2:196 – interpretation of the meaning].
·        Fasting in fulfillment of a vow
Mustahabb (encouraged) fasting 
·        Fasting the day of `Ashura
·        Fasting the day of `Arafah
·        Fasting on Mondays and Thursdays each week
·        Fasting three days of each month
·        Fasting six days of Shawwal
·        Fasting most of the month of Sha`ban
·        Fasting the month of Muharram
·        Fasting alternate days – which is the best of fasting
All of these are proven in hasan and sahih hadiths, and may be found on this site. 
Makruh (disliked) fasting 
·        Singling out Friday for fasting – because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do not fast on a Friday unless you fast a day before or a day afterwards.” (Agreed upon)
·        Singling out Saturday for fasting – because the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Do not fast on Saturdays apart from days when you are obliged to fast, even if one of you cannot find anything other than grape stalks or the bark of a tree (to suck on, to make sure that he is not fasting).” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 744, who classed it as hasan. Also narrated by Abu Dawud, 2421; Ibn Majah, 1726; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Irwa al-Ghalil, 960.
Al-Tirmidhi said: “What is meant by its being makruh is that a man should not single out Saturday for fasting because the Jews venerate Saturday.”
Forbidden fasts 
·        Fasting on ‘Eid al-Fitr, ‘Eid al-Adha and the days of Tashriq, which are the three days after ‘Eid al-Adha.
·        Fasting on the “day of doubt” – which is the thirtieth of Sha`ban, if the sky was cloudy and the new moon could not be sighted. But if the sky was clear there can be no doubt.
·        Fasts observed by women who are menstruating and bleeding following childbirth.
Permissible fasts
These are fasts that do not come under any of the four headings mentioned above. What is meant by permissible here is that there is no report enjoining or forbidding fasting on this day in particular, such as Tuesdays and Wednesdays, even though in principle, observing a voluntary fast is an act of worship that is encouraged.

66919,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/66919,Is it acceptable for him to put his money with his wife’s money and pay zakaah together?,"I am employed and my wife is too, and my money and hers are one – we take from both. The way in which we pay zakaah on our wealth is that I work out how much money we have altogether on the specified date in Ramadaan in addition to the gold, then I divide the total by forty. Is there anything wrong with combining the wealth and the way in which I pay zakaah?.",,,"Praise be to Allah.
    There is nothing wrong with combining your money with your 
    wife’s money and gold, then paying zakaah on the total. That is because the 
    zakaah on money, gold and silver does not change, whether it is combined or 
    dealt with separately, because what matters is paying one-quarter of 
    one-tenth, whether there is a little wealth or a lot, so long as it has 
    reached the nisaab.  

    Combining or separating wealth only makes a difference to 
    zakaah in the case of an’aam animals (camels, cattle and sheep). 

    What you and your wife are doing with your salaries and 
    paying zakaah on them and on the gold that she has in one month is best and 
    is the easiest way of paying zakaah on one's salary. 

    What you have done by dividing your wealth by forty is also 
    correct, because the rate of zakaah to be paid on gold and cash is 
    one-quarter of one-tenth which is one in forty.  

    Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) 
    was asked: 

    There is a man who depends on his monthly salary; he spends 
    some and saves the rest. How should he pay zakaah on this money? 

    He replied: 

    He should write down what he saves of his salary, and pay 
    zakaah on it when one year has passed.  Zakaah should be paid on the savings 
    of each month when one year has passed. If he pays zakaah on the total in 
    the first month, there is nothing wrong with that and he will be rewarded 
    for that, and it will be regarded as zakaah paid in advance for the savings 
    for which one year has not yet passed. There is no reason why a person 
    should not pay zakaah in advance if he sees some benefit in doing so. But 
    delaying it after the year has passed is not permissible, unless there is a 
    valid shar’i excuse, such as the wealth not being available or there being 
    no poor people. End quote.

66976,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/66976,He retained semen that resulted from an erotic dream and was harmed by that. Should he resort to the ‘secret habit’?,"I am a young man, twenty-nine years old. I woke up yesterday and I had just had an erotic dream, but no fluid was emitted, and I went back to sleep. But when I woke up again, I found that I had a severe pain in my testicles. I know that there is some fluid that is retained in me, because this has happened to me before and I treated it by sitting in warm water and getting rid of this retained fluid. In fact I decided to use the same treatment as before, but the warm water did not do anything and I suffered intense pain, and the shaytaan whispered to me to get rid of this fluid by means of the secret habit, so I did that. I swear that I had given up this habit a long time ago, but I was under pressure because of this pain.",,,"Praise be to Allah.The secret 
    habit is haraam. This has been explained in the answer to question no.
    329. 
The scholars 
    have stated that it is permissible to resort to the secret habit if that is 
    in order to relieve desire that may lead one to fall into the sins of zina 
    or homosexuality. Similarly it is permissible for the purpose of medical 
    tests if he is single and needs such tests. And it is permissible to resort 
    to it if there is the fear of physical harm due to retention of semen. 
    Perhaps this is what is referred to in the question. In any case, it is not 
    permissible to go beyond the bounds of necessity, and it is not permissible 
    to repeat it, and necessity should be measured without exaggerating. 
Shaykh 
    Mansoor al-Bahooti (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 
Whoever 
    masturbates by hand for fear of falling into zina or for fear of physical 
    harm, there is no sin on him if he is not able to get married, not even to a 
    slave woman, and he cannot afford a slave woman, otherwise it is haraam and 
    he should be punished by ta’zeer. End quote. 
Al-Iqnaa’, 
    4/268. 
In Sharh 
    Muntaha al-Iraadaat (3/364) it says: 
Whoever 
    masturbates, man or woman, when there is no need, it is haraam to do that 
    and he (or she) should be punished for it by ta’zeer, because it is a sin. 
    If he does it for fear of zina or homosexuality, there is no sin on him, and 
    the same applies, even more so, if he does it for fear of physical harm. End 
    quote. 
We applaud 
    you for giving up this bad habit and urge you to remain steadfast in that, 
    and if what you did was only because of the pain, then there is no sin on 
    you in sha Allaah.

66998,https://islamqa.info/en/answers/66998,Is it permissible for a woman to observe i’tikaaf on behalf of her deceased parents?,Is it permissible for a woman to observe i’tikaaf on behalf of her deceased parents?.,,,"Praise be to Allah.
    Some of the scholars are of the view that it is permissible 
    to do any act of worship and to give the reward for it to the dead, whilst 
    others are of the view that that is limited only to the acts of worship that 
    are mentioned in the texts. 

    Shaykh Saalih ibn Fawzaan (may Allaah preserve him) was 
    asked: What are the things that will benefit the deceased if done by the 
    living? Is there a difference between physical acts of worship and others? 
    We hope that you can explain this matter to us and show us a principle to 
    which we may refer whenever we are confused about such issues. Please advise 
    us, may Allaah bless you. 

    He replied: The living may benefit the deceased in the ways 
    indicated by the evidence, such as saying du’aa’ for him, seeking 
    forgiveness for him, giving charity on his behalf, performing Hajj and 
    ‘Umrah on his behalf, paying off debts that he owes, and carrying out 
    Islamically acceptable instructions left in his will. The evidence indicates 
    that all of these are prescribed in Islam. 

    Some of the scholars added to these all acts of worship that 
    a Muslim does and gives the reward for it to another Muslim, living or dead. 
    But the correct view is that it is limited only to those for which there is 
    evidence, and that may be regarded as an exception to what Allaah says in 
    the verse (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And that man can have nothing but what he does (good or 
    bad)”

    [al-Najm 53:39] 

    And Allaah knows best. 
Al-Muntaqa,

    With regard to parents in particular, Islam regards the son 
    as a source of his father’s earning good deeds. 

    It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with 
    him) said: The Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) said: “The good deeds that will reach a believer after his death 
    are: knowledge which he learned and then spread; a righteous son whom he 
    leaves behind; a copy of the Qur’aan that he leaves as a legacy; a mosque 
    that he built; a house that he built for wayfarers; a canal that he dug; or 
    charity that he gave during his lifetime when he was in good health. These 
    deeds will reach him after his death.” Narrated by Ibn Maajah, 242; classed 
    as saheeh Ibn Khuzaymah 4/121; classed as hasan by al-Tirmidhi and 
    al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Targheeb 1/18. 

    Al-Sindi said in his commentary on Sunan Ibn Maajah: 

    A righteous child is regarded as part of a person’s deeds and 
    good teaching, because the father is the reason for his existence, and he is 
    the cause of his righteousness because he has taught him true guidance, just 
    as Allaah said in the Qur’aan, describing the son of Nooh (peace be upon 
    him), (interpretation of the meaning): “verily, his work is unrighteous” 
    [Hood 11:46] (i.e., a person may be labeled according to his deeds). End 
    quote. 

    Shaykh al-Albaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: 

    What a righteous son does of good deeds, his father will have 
    a similar reward for them, without that detracting from his reward in the 
    slightest, because his son is part of his efforts and his earning (of 
    deeds). Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And that man can have nothing but what he does (good or 
    bad)”

    [al-Najm 53:39]

    And the Messenger of Allaah  (peace and blessings of 
    Allaah be upon him) said: “The best that a man consumes is what he earns, 
    and his son is part of his earnings.” Narrated by the four authors of 
    al-Sunan and classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani because of 
    corroborating reports. End quote from Ahkaam al-Janaa’iz, p. 126, 
    217. 

    Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan (may Allaah preserve him) was 
    asked: 

    What are the deeds that will benefit one’s parents, whether 
    they are alive or dead? 

    He replied: These deeds are: honouring them when they are 
    alive, treating them kindly in word and deed, taking care of their needs for 
    maintenance, accommodation and other things, feeling happy to be with them, 
    speaking nicely to them and serving them, because Allaah says 
    (interpretation of the meaning): 

    “And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. 
    And that you be dutiful to your parents”

    [al-Isra’ 17:23]

    especially when they grow old.  

    After they die, the ways of honouring them that remain are 
    making du’aa’ for them, giving charity on their behalf, doing Hajj and 
    ‘Umrah on their behalf, paying off debts that they owe, upholding the ties 
    of kinship that one has through them, honouring their friends, and carrying 
    out their last wishes that are in accordance with Islam. End quote.

    Al-Muntaha, 2/162. 

    Secondly: 

    With regard to women observing i’tikaaf, i’tikaaf is 
    mustahabb for men and women, but in the case of women it is subject to the 
    condition that it be done with the permission of the woman’s family or 
    husband, and that there should be no fitnah caused by her observing 
    i’tikaaf.

      Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have 
    mercy on him) said:  

    A woman may observe i’tikaaf so long as her doing so does not 
    involve any fitnah. If it involves any fitnah, then she should not be 
    allowed to do that, because if something forbidden results from something 
    that is mustahabb, it must be prevented, just as if something forbidden 
    results from something that is permissible, it must be prevented. If we 
    assume that if she observes i’tikaaf in the mosque there will be fitnah, 
    such as happens in al-Masjid al-Haraam, because in al-Masjid al-Haraam there 
    is no place that is just for women, and if a woman observes i'tikaaf she 
    will inevitably have to sleep, whether at night or during the day, and if 
    she sleeps among men who are coming and going there will be fitnah.

     The evidence that i’tikaaf is prescribed for women is the 
    fact that the wives of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be 
    upon him) observed i’tikaaf during his lifetime and after his death. But if 
    there is the fear of fitnah, then a woman should not be allowed to do it, 
    because the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade 
    things that were less that that. When he  (peace and blessings of Allaah 
    be upon him) wanted to observe i’tikaaf he went out one day and saw a tent 
    for ‘Aa’ishah and a tent for others of his wives. He  (peace and 
    blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Is it righteousness that you seek?!” 
    then he ordered that the tents be taken down, and he did not observe 
    i’tikaaf that year, and he made it up in Shawwaal. This indicates that if a 
    woman’s i’tikaaf will result in fitnah, it should not be allowed. End 
    quote. 

    Al-Sharh al-Mumti’, 6/510, 511 

    Conclusion: A person should do a lot of righteous deeds on 
    his own behalf, before his life comes to an end and his deeds are cut off. 
    His parent will have a share of the reward for these deeds without that 
    detracting from their children’s reward. I’tikaaf is a righteous deed, but 
    in the case of a woman it must be done according to the guidelines and 
    conditions as stated by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy on 
    him).
